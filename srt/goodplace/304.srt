1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,045
What the hell is that?

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:08,008
Oh! Hey, guys.
What are you doing down here?

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:12,178
Well, we came to get more champagne,
which is right behind the magic door.

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:16,891
What door?

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,309
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's going on?

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,645
Who are you
and why were you talking about us?

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,231
And what's the Good Place
and what are afterlife points?

8
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,983
And who has the most, and is it me?

9
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,944
Wait a second, I know this guy.
You're Zack Pizazz.

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,320
He got me here from Jacksonville.

11
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:33,199
No, this is the librarian
from the university.

12
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,661
Well, I know him as Gordon Indigo,
a very rude Silicon Valley investor.

13
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,372
[chuckles nervously] All right, guys,
I can explain everything.

14
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,416
Just give me one second, okay?

15
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,668
How do we get out of this?

16
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,504
Well, they heard us explaining
the entire system of the afterlife,

17
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,340
and they saw an interdimensional door
open and close,

18
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,468
so not a ton of wiggle room here.

19
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,305
But you're forgetting
one crucial piece of information.

20
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,142
Right? I mean, you're forgetting

21
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,394
one crucial piece of information
that'll save us?

22
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,315
Yo, buddy. You have like three seconds
to explain this crazy space door,

23
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,858
or Chidi here is gonna beat you up.

24
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,860
-Oh, no. I'm not.
-Yes.

25
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,446
But I would like to know
about the space door.

26
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,449
All right. I don't know
what choice we have.

27
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,825
I'll tell you the truth.

28
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:22,290
My name is Special Agent Rick Justice
and this is Lisa "Frenchy" Fuqua.

29
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:26,795
We're with the FBI,
and all of you are in grave danger.

30
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:29,964
I knew it.

31
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,225
{\an8}Agent Fuqua and I
are paranormal investigators.

32
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,018
{\an8}We're here to protect you from...

33
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,270
{\an8}demons.

34
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,647
{\an8}No, wait, that's real.

35
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,817
{\an8}Ghouls... Ghouls.
We're here to protect you from ghouls.

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,487
{\an8}Now, I had to appear in
different disguises to keep tabs on you,

37
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,866
{\an8}but you are all involved together
in this FBI case.

38
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,661
{\an8}-[scoffs]
-No, we can prove this.

39
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,164
{\an8}We have detailed files on all of you.
Ask Janet anything.

40
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,916
{\an8}-Who's Janet?
-Frenchy.

41
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,292
{\an8}-Frenchy.
-Sorry.

42
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,045
{\an8}Frenchy's nickname is Janet.

43
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,421
{\an8}I thought her nickname was Frenchy.

44
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:11,923
{\an8}It is.

45
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,970
{\an8}That's why they call her
Lisa "Double Nickname" Fuqua.

46
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,514
{\an8}Okay, guys, I used to work at a place

47
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,850
{\an8}that was raided
by the FBI pretty frequently.

48
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:26,187
{\an8}I know a fed when I see one.
And these two jamokes are not FBI. Okay?

49
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,315
{\an8}Who are you? Really.

50
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,943
{\an8}All right, all right. Fine.
Just give me one more second.

51
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,945
{\an8}-One.
-Serious question?

52
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,864
{\an8}-Yep?
-Should we kill them?

53
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,532
{\an8}-What?
-It might work.

54
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,868
{\an8}We kill them, go back through the door,

55
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,663
{\an8}somehow grab them before they get
to the Bad Place and regroup from there.

56
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,207
{\an8}I could kill them right now.
And, you know, it would be easy.

57
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,961
Their bodies are very poorly made.
They're mostly goo and juice.

58
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,088
You just take the juice out
and then they're dead.

59
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:55,383
Michael, they've seen through the door
into the afterlife,

60
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,218
and they heard how it works.

61
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,679
[sighs] It's over.

62
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:01,931
Ah.

63
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,228
Fine.

64
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,939
I guess I'll start at the beginning.

65
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,650
You all died.

66
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,034
Well, this sucks.

67
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:26,289
So, to sum up.
There is a heaven and hell.

68
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,999
We've been to hell,

69
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:32,128
and now, no matter how good we are
for the rest of our lives,

70
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,130
we're going back to hell.

71
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,799
Again, it's not
the classic Christian hell,

72
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,385
but that's the gist, yes.

73
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,888
As soon as you learned
about the afterlife,

74
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:48,102
your motivation to be good was corrupted,
so you can't earn points anymore.

75
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:52,232
So sorry for eternally dooming you.

76
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,650
And that's our bad, guys.

77
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,320
So, all the attempts you made
to torture us,

78
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,281
we must have been
in the afterlife for 100 years.

79
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,242
Almost 300, actually.

80
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,993
How is it possible
that all these things happened to us,

81
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,789
but no time passed on Earth?
Did you go back in time to save us?

82
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,459
Ah, I didn't have to
because of Jeremy Bearimy.

83
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,295
Who's Jeremy Bearimy?

84
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:21,177
Okay, things in the afterlife don't happen
while things are happening here

85
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,931
because while time on Earth
moves in a straight line...

86
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,309
One thing happens,
then the next, then the next.

87
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,689
Time in the afterlife
moves in a Jeremy Bearimy.

88
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,357
What?

89
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,318
[Michael] In the afterlife,
time doubles back and loops around

90
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,570
and ends up looking something like...

91
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,656
{\an8}Jeremy Bearimy.

92
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,409
{\an8}This is the timeline in the afterlife.

93
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:48,788
Happens to kinda look like the name
Jeremy Bearimy in cursive English,

94
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,540
so that's what we call it.

95
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,960
Sorry, I'm...
My brain is melting.

96
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,464
How can events happen
before the ones that happened...

97
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,216
before?

98
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,343
Just the way it works.

99
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,304
It's Jeremy Bearimy.

100
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,640
I don't know what to tell you.
That's the easiest way to describe it.

101
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,852
Okay, but... what the hell is this?

102
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,896
The dot over the "I."
The hell is that?

103
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,983
Okay. How do I explain this concisely?

104
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,777
This is Tuesdays...

105
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,238
and also July.

106
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,115
-And sometimes it's never.
-[Michael] That's true.

107
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,160
{\an8}Occasionally, that moment
on the Bearimy timeline

108
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:31,914
{\an8}is the time-moment
when nothing never occurs.

109
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,293
So... you get it.

110
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:41,674
This broke me. The dot over the "I."
That broke me. I'm...

111
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,968
I'm done.

112
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,512
You know what?
I'm glad this whole thing happened.

113
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,933
Because now I can go back
to living my life the way I used to:

114
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,895
Only caring about myself
because being good is pointless.

115
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,354
No, no. Please, Eleanor--

116
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,649
No, thank you. I'm outtie.
See ya in hell. [gasps]

117
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,653
You know, I just realized,
I always say that when leaving a room,

118
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,198
but right now, it's accurate.

119
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,993
I will literally see all of you in hell!

120
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,787
Not if I see you first!

121
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,330
[Tahani] Let's go, Jason.

122
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,208
No, no, look, look.
You guys, this is not over.

123
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,835
We have to stay together.
Look, we'll figure something out.

124
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,297
Like, this one idea I had,
I could kill all of you.

125
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,176
That's my birthday.

126
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,223
Hey, buddy, it's my birthday.

127
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,683
One free margarita, please.

128
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,061
Well, happy birthday!
Can I just see some ID?

129
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,854
-No.
-[chuckles] Why not?

130
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,066
Well, because it's not really my birthday.
I just want a free margarita.

131
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,318
Well, if I just randomly
gave you a free drink,

132
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,113
I'd have to do it for everyone.
Pretty soon, I'd go out of business.

133
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,156
[chuckles] Then don't do it for everyone.

134
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,575
Just do it for me.
Because it's my birthday!

135
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,160
Happy birthday.

136
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,583
Jason, I have an idea,
but it's a little risky.

137
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,377
I need you to act as my bodyguard.

138
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,005
Like my friend Kevin Costner in that movie
where he was a bodyguard.

139
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,965
<i>The Bodyguard.</i>

140
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,842
No problem. My cousin once hired me

141
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,885
to do crowd control
for his off-brand Sea World.

142
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,722
Well, technically, it was just
a bunch of kiddie pools full of jellyfish.

143
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,642
And instead of a killer whale,
they killed a whale.

144
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,523
Excuse me, miss.
We'd like to buy one opera, please.

145
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:25,862
Uh, what he means is I would like to give
$2 million to the Sydney Opera.

146
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:30,867
Miss Al-Jamil, this is so generous.
With a donation of that size,

147
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,703
we will dedicate a rehearsal hall
in your honor.

148
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,829
Thank you, but no.

149
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,916
Lovely as it sounds to add
to my collection of wings and atria,

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,668
the gift will be anonymous.

151
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,712
As you wish. I'll draw up the papers.

152
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,841
Why don't you want your name
on the opera house?

153
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,301
I love getting my name on stuff.

154
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,887
In Jacksonville,
I got a flu virus named after me

155
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,638
'cause I kissed a bat on a dare.

156
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,433
Well, I was thinking
about why I was sent to hell,

157
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:59,353
as one is wont to do when one has recently
been told that one had been sent to hell.

158
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,688
And it occurred to me.

159
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,692
I have always been held captive
by my desire for attention.

160
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,777
Now that I know how it all ends,

161
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,489
I just want to be virtuous
for virtue's sake.

162
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,823
[Jason] That's beautiful.

163
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,493
I gotta say though,
if you want to do more charity,

164
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,661
I know a way that could be a lot of fun.

165
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,170
Hey. Do you wanna talk to God?

166
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:28,007
"God is dead.
God remains dead. And we have killed him.

167
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,551
Who will wipe this blood off us?

168
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,803
What festivals of atonement,

169
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,682
what sacred games
shall we have to invent?"

170
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,935
Friedrich Nietzsche, 1882.

171
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,354
I was just trying to sell you some drugs
and you made it weird.

172
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,814
[sprinklers spraying]

173
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,998
I've never written a manifesto before.
What are you gonna say?

174
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,668
It'll be a complete account
of everything we've learned,

175
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,296
from the beginning of my neighborhood
to right now.

176
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,300
And then a recommendation of how we feel
the afterlife could be improved.

177
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,262
And we turn ourselves in,
we'll give it to the Judge.

178
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,638
Hopefully she'll read it.

179
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:22,019
We failed, Janet, but maybe one day,
someone else will succeed.

180
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,355
Okay, so...

181
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,649
A...

182
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,236
man... i...

183
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,322
fes... to.

184
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,824
By...

185
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,451
Mi...

186
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,288
Where's the "H"?
This keyboard doesn't have an "H."

187
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,999
-Well--
-Wait, wait. I see it. I see it.

188
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,918
[chuckles] Oh!

189
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,962
-No, no. Look what I did!
-Yeah.

190
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,423
[Michael] I wrote "Micahel." That's...

191
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,758
Okay, back, back, back, back, back.

192
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,677
Maybe you should dictate
and I should type.

193
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,014
Good call.

194
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,851
Just laying out some early details.
Go ahead and start dictating.

195
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,355
Look, there have to be rules.
Every place has rules.

196
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,107
Ugh! Fine. Here are my rules.

197
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,610
Rule number one:
I get to do whatever I want,

198
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,069
and you all just have to deal with it.

199
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,780
Rule two: No more Spider-Man movies.

200
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:19,035
There's way too many Spider-Man movies.
Too many dorky, little, twerpy Spider-men.

201
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,077
[slurps]

202
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,164
Rule three: Everyone, leave me alone.

203
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,835
So you just take care of yourself,
you don't owe anything to anyone else?

204
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,046
If people lived that way,
society would break down.

205
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,423
Yeah. In America,
everyone does whatever they want.

206
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,760
Society did break down.
It's terrible and it's great!

207
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:39,472
You only look out for number one,
scream at whoever disagrees with you,

208
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,099
there are no bees because they all died,

209
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,810
and if you need surgery,
you just beg for money on the Internet.

210
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,103
It's a perfect system!

211
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,648
Now, get me another drink.
Tomorrow's my birthday.

212
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:54,278
Well, well, well, a wallet.

213
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,699
My rules say
I get to take the cash out and keep it,

214
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,744
because in my society,
I do whatever I want 'cause I'm awesome.

215
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,335
Just take it. Take it, Eleanor. Just...

216
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,003
[grunts]

217
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,632
All right,
this is the address on the license.

218
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,801
-That'll be 58 bucks.
-Keep the meter running.

219
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,928
As soon as I'm done here,
I'm gonna head to the airport,

220
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,721
get the hell out of this trash country

221
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,432
where everyone is either a criminal
or a spider.

222
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,313
Hello, ma'am. Is there a Fred Booth here?
I found his wallet,

223
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,483
and now I'm doing a nice thing
and returning it because I suck.

224
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,528
Sorry, he moved. I can give you
his new address if you'd like.

225
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,863
Actually, I have some of his mail.

226
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,657
If you're gonna go see him,
could you bring it along?

227
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,911
Of course. I would love
to bring some rando his mail.

228
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,122
Anything else you want me to schlep over?

229
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,542
Well, this awesome day gets awesomer.

230
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,796
Before the airport,
we're heading to 78 Palmer Street.

231
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,590
Ha! That's right next to the bar
I picked you up.

232
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,009
I feel like a bloody boomerang.
[chuckling]

233
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,971
Of course you do! [laughs sarcastically]

234
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,655
-Uh...
-Hello.

235
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,532
Sir, you can't shop here without a shirt.

236
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,908
Oh!

237
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,422
So, that'll be $880.

238
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,631
Here's my credit card.

239
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,092
Why don't you just charge it
and keep it forever?

240
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,137
And also, here's the keys to my car.

241
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,015
Wait, do you guys have, like,
a "take a car, leave a car" tray?

242
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,767
No? You know, just take it. Just take it.

243
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,772
Excuse me, sir.
Would you like some free money?

244
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,775
Now you can buy fingers for your gloves.

245
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,278
Hello, madam. Are you poor?

246
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,364
Here's $5,000 for a new stroller.
Have a nice day.

247
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,700
You don't have to say
the "are you poor" part.

248
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,618
Right.

249
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,036
Hello. Here's some money.

250
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,204
-Here you go.
-Hello.

251
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,624
Here you go.
Now you can buy a bigger chin guitar.

252
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,545
-This was a truly great plan.
-[Jason] Aww, thanks.

253
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,672
Man, there's so many times

254
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,051
that just this amount of money
would've changed my life.

255
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,888
I could've paid my rent.
I could've gone to a real doctor

256
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,807
instead of pretending I was a big dog,
so I could go to the vet.

257
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,895
You know, that gives me an idea,

258
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:37,149
which I suppose, one could argue, means
that anything could've given me an idea.

259
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,776
Come with me.

260
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,362
I'm sorry, Miss Al-Jamil,

261
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,240
but I just don't feel comfortable
processing this request.

262
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,157
Why not?

263
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:50,454
Well, it just seems a bit odd
to transfer the totality of your account,

264
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:55,709
131 million British pounds,
to the account of this person,

265
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:01,173
a man who is so flagrantly ignoring
the "one lollipop per customer" rule.

266
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,760
No. I walked out and back in each time,
so I'm different customers.

267
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,680
We're technically
supposed to shut down the bank

268
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,266
if anyone from Florida even walks in.

269
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:14,061
Look, all my life, this money
has been a weight around my neck.

270
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,897
Like the Heart of the Ocean necklace
my friend James Cameron once gave me.

271
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,692
I don't want the money.
My friend Jason does.

272
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,277
I would like to give it to him.

273
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,029
If it's easier, you can just put it
on a GameStop gift card.

274
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,826
That does not make it easier.
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

275
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,581
-Good day.
-[Eleanor] Fred?

276
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,041
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
I have all your crap.

277
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,460
[Fred] Thank you.

278
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,045
[Eleanor] And your wallet.

279
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,465
Oh, my goodness! Thank you so much.

280
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,383
It was nothing.

281
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,470
Dude, I didn't take your money.
I would never even think of doing that.

282
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,306
No, no, no. I'm not worried about that.

283
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,641
Ah! Here it is.

284
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,771
{\an8}I started a new job a few months ago
and I got really nervous,

285
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,442
so my daughter Carolyn drew this for me
to make me feel better.

286
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,193
It's my good luck charm.

287
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,530
Every time I'm stressed at work now,
I just have to look at this,

288
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,657
and I feel safe.

289
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,037
Look, a lot of people wouldn't have
tried so hard to get this to me.

290
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,788
You are a good person, Eleanor.

291
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,666
I really hope my daughter
turns out like you when she grows up.

292
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,046
-You all right?
-No, you shut up!

293
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,673
Sorry. It's been a weird day.

[clears throat] I'm gonna eat
all this chili and/or die trying.

299
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,697
Anyone want any?
I'm just gonna put it right down here.

300
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,699
Come on. Dip your paws in my chili.

301
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,701
Scoop your little mittens
right in the stew.

302
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,788
Professor, I can see
that you're going through something,

303
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:59,583
but exams are next week.
So, can you teach us anything?

304
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,585
All right, nerd.

305
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,713
You want to learn something?
I'll teach you something.

306
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,256
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of life.

307
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,883
How do you like them apples?

308
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:12,054
Now, over the last 2,500 years,

309
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,307
Western philosophers
have formed three main theories

310
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,142
on how to live an ethical life.

311
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,770
Now, first off, there's "virtue ethics."

312
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:24,858
Aristotle believed that there were
certain virtues of mind and character,

313
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,610
like courage or generosity,

314
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,698
<i>and you should try to develop yourself</i>
<i>in accordance with those virtues.</i>

315
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,366
The gift will be anonymous.

316
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,576
Next, there's consequentialism.

317
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,706
The basis for judgment about
whether something is right or wrong

318
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,750
stems from the consequences
of that action.

319
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,004
<i>How much utility or good</i>
<i>did it accomplish</i>

320
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,839
<i>versus how much pain or bad.</i>

321
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,216
And finally, there's deontology.

322
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,928
The school of thought
that there are strict rules and duties

323
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,973
<i>that everyone must adhere to</i>
<i>in a functioning society.</i>

324
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,393
<i>Being ethical is simply identifying</i>
<i>and obeying those duties</i>

325
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,270
<i>and following those rules.</i>

326
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,147
But here's the thing,
my little chili babies,

327
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,442
all three of those theories
are hot, stinky cat dookie.

328
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,569
The true meaning of life,

329
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:14,366
the actual ethical system
that you should all follow is nihilism.

330
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,786
The world is empty.

331
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,666
There is no point to anything
and you're just gonna die.

332
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,835
So, do whatever!

333
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:29,757
And now, I'm gonna eat
my marshmallow candy chili in silence,

334
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,969
and you all can jump up your own butts.

335
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,388
Is that gonna be on the test?

336
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,223
Yes. And no.

337
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,976
And you all get A's or F's.

338
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,312
And there is no test,
and you all failed it.

339
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,606
And you all got A's. Who cares?

340
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,276
Goodbye. Goodbye.

341
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,159
Cool lecture.

342
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,996
And cooler shirt. You feeling all right?

343
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,873
-Feel fine.
-[Eleanor] Hmm.

344
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:07,336
I do have a stomachache.
Why do I always have a stomachache?

345
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,047
Well, you just ate 50 pounds
of chili, bro. This one's on you.

346
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,760
Look, I know the future seems bleak,
but I have a plan.

347
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,928
Come with me.

348
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,682
Nah-uh-uh, leave that chili, weirdo.

349
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:27,147
A complete account of every single thing
we've done and learned.

350
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,775
I added all the data
we've gathered here on Earth

351
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,735
in chart and graph form.

352
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,738
And I added a pretty tasty little recipe
for cinnamon rolls

353
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,406
made out of pizza dough.

354
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,324
-[chuckles]
-[Michael] Ha!

355
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,912
Maybe someone, some day,
can learn from our mistakes

356
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:46,125
and enact real change
in the process of judging people.

357
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,212
But for now, Janet, old friend,

358
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,299
we are going to enjoy our time on Earth
before we're retired.

359
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,218
-[Janet] Hmm.
-[Michael] So, let's get started.

360
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,719
I know it's touristy,

361
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,514
but I'd really like to
visit a LensCrafters.

362
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,057
[Janet] Ooh! And I'd like to get bangs.

363
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,854
Hey, guys. It's really nice to see you.

364
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:11,275
Um, is everything okay? I mean,
other than, you know, everything?

365
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:16,280
We've started to accept our fates.
It's all chili under the bridge.

366
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,117
Good, you're all here. Big news, everyone.

367
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,786
-We got married!
-We got tacos!

368
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,623
Yeah, yeah, we got married.
And then after we got married,

369
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,959
we got tacos!

370
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,546
-Wow! Wow, that's crazy!
-[Michael speaking indistinctly]

371
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,423
Well, it's strictly platonic, of course.

372
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,468
We only did it so I could
legally give Jason half my money.

373
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,888
We just popped over to the British Embassy
and signed the papers.

374
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:45,475
That's insane, but it's also,
like, the 11th most insane thing

375
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,227
to happen today, so who cares?

376
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,021
I need everyone to focus up.

377
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,064
So, the four of us...

378
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:57,654
The six of us, really, are doomed.
Our fates are sealed.

379
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,283
But I think we have one move left:
we can try.

380
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,619
Try what?

381
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,370
Try to do good.

382
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,166
That stupid little voice in my head
told me to do something good today,

383
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,669
and it was so annoying,
but it also made a dork

384
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,922
and his very untalented daughter
super happy.

385
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,676
Me trying, just a little bit,
put some good out into the world.

386
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,138
The six of us
are not getting into the Good Place,

387
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,600
but there are still people in this world
that we care about.

388
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,562
So I say, we try and help them
be good people,

389
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,398
try and help them get in.
I mean, why not try?

390
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,275
It's better than not trying, right?

391
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,072
That's a lovely sentiment, Eleanor.
Let's try. I'm in.

392
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,156
{\an8}I'm in, too.

393
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,368
{\an8}I'm gonna remember this day forever
because of your dope speech.

394
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,704
{\an8}And also because of the great tacos I had,
and also because I got married,

395
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,916
{\an8}and I found out I was going to hell,
and also I became a hundred-millionaire.

396
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,292
{\an8}All right, we get it. We get it.

397
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,420
{\an8}It goes without saying that we're in.
Let's say it anyway.

398
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,755
{\an8}-Okay. We're in.
-We're in. We're in.

399
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:57,798
{\an8}All right, you go.

400
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,174
{\an8}-We're in.
-We're in. [chuckles]

401
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,385
{\an8}-We're just so excited!
-We're in!

402
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,178
{\an8}What do you say, bud?

403
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,431
{\an8}You wanna join the Soul Squad?
Try to save some souls?

404
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,101
{\an8}-Yeah, I'm in.
-[sighs]

405
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,437
{\an8}But first, I have to go
to the bathroom forever.

406
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,606
There you are, my love.

407
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,277
I was just on my way to the MRI lab,
thought I heard your voice.

408
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,738
Ready to go to the airport,
start our lives together?

409
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,742
Go ahead, Tahani. We're rolling.
