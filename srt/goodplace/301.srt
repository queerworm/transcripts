1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,838
{\an8}I still believe that they
would have become good people

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:09,050
{\an8}if they'd just gotten a push
in the right direction.

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:11,970
{\an8}Oh, no.

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,555
{\an8}-What are they talking about?
-No idea.

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,889
{\an8}It's only four people.

6
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:18,977
{\an8}And it's clearly the best way to see
if bad people can become good

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,521
{\an8}without knowing anything
about what's waiting in the afterlife.

8
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,065
{\an8}[groaning]

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,233
{\an8}Okay, let's do it.

10
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:29,320
{\an8}But there have to be strict rules.
Otherwise, the results will be tainted.

11
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:33,408
{\an8}And I reserve the right
to change my mind at any point.

12
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:37,162
{\an8}Would someone who's not an eternal being
please explain to me what the--

13
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,079
[snaps fingers]

14
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,319
Hi, I'm Michael.

15
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,988
You must be the Doorman.

16
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,200
Ah.

17
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,454
This is wild.
I had no idea this was even here.

18
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,249
So, I have this ruling from the Judge.

19
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,045
Heading on down to Earth to reverse
the deaths of these four people.

20
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,048
It's kinda tricky, you know?
Starts up a new timeline.

21
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,841
So there might be some ripple effects.

22
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,470
But it's necessary for the experiment
that we're doing there.

23
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:41,434
So, how long does this trip take?
Hope I don't get a middle seat. [chuckles]

24
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,563
Wow, I haven't heard a joke
in 8,000 years.

25
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,774
And I still haven't.

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,902
That's the door to Earth.

27
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,446
Go through there,
you'll be wherever you need to be.

28
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,906
You won't have any other powers, though.

29
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,283
You want to get around,
you'll have to take a bus or something.

30
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,785
A bus?

31
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:03,414
[scoffs] Oh, boy. Oh, man.
I'm gonna sit in a front-facing seat.

32
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,501
No, no, maybe a sideways-facing seat.
[chuckling]

33
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,294
I'm gonna get so motion sick.

34
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,547
Oh, man! What do I do?

35
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,006
-Just grab that key?
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

36
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:18,388
This key is made of the very first atoms
that came into existence in the universe.

37
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,308
It is one of a kind
and cannot be duplicated. See?

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,728
{\an8}"Do not duplicate."

39
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,730
Only I touch this key.

40
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,358
And what's the significance
of the key chain?

41
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,695
Nothin'. I just like frogs.
I'm a frog guy.

42
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,072
When you need to get back here,

43
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,658
make sure you're alone, press this button.

-Any questions? No?

45
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,414
Great. Knock yourself out.

46
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,295
Uh-oh.

[gasps]

48
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,266
I'm sorry, but this is
an important moment in our--

49
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,227
-On your right, pal!
-Ah, jeez, watch it, man!

50
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,104
Ahhh!

51
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,066
[Tahani] Come down!
Come down, where you belong!

56
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:28,917
Oh, wow! I was just on Earth.
It was incredible.

57
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,295
The... the traffic, the pigeons,

58
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:37,759
and I saw this place that was at once
a Pizza Hut and a Taco Bell.

59
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,638
I mean, oh, the mind reels.

60
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:46,976
A Pizza Hut and a Taco Bell! Ah!

61
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,062
[theme music playing]

62
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,444
{\an8}Oh, Janet, it was everything
I ever imagined.

63
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,820
{\an8}-I got to ride a bike.
-Hmm.

64
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,657
{\an8}I put a coin in a thing and got a gumball.

65
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,868
{\an8}And then someone came up to me
and said, "Hot enough for ya?"

66
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,746
{\an8}And you know what I said?
I said, "Tell me about it." [laughs]

67
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,249
{\an8}Well, I am glad
that you got to chew a gumball.

68
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,877
{\an8}Oh, damn. I didn't even think to chew it.

69
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,920
{\an8}[ticker tapes ticking]

70
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,463
{\an8}Missed opportunity. Shoot!

{\an8}Did you also save their lives?

72
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,678
{\an8}Yes, of course. Everyone is safe.
Including Jason.

73
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:27,767
{\an8}Now, just sit back and watch
as they become better people. [chuckles]

74

{\an8}Being good is for suckers.
What do you even get out of it? I quit.

{\an8}Morning, Chidi. Blueberry muffin for ya?

00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,113
{\an8}Uh, I don't know. Maybe. I can't decide.

78
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,366
{\an8}-You all right there, mate?
-Okay, I've made my decision.

79
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,368
{\an8}I want to...

80

[interviewer] Hey, Tahani Al-Jamil.

83

{\an8}I'm from
<i>International Sophisticate Magazine. </i>

84
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:02,302
{\an8}-Mind if we ask you 582 questions?
-Sounds delightful.

85
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,845
{\an8}[interviewer] Where are we exactly?

86
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,931
{\an8}My <i>pied-Ã -terre,</i>
just off the coast of Barcelona.

87
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,225
{\an8}[interviewer] What's one thing people
don't know about you?

88
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,979
{\an8}That I was such a tomboy in high school.
See?

89
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,024
{\an8}[interviewer] Wow, looking good!
Okay, next question.

90
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,068
{\an8}Who would you say is the most
famous person in your phone?

91
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,989
"It's not about who you know.
Enlightenment comes from within."

92
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,035
The Dalai Lama texted me that. [sniffs]

93
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:35,084
K, will you make me the happiest man
in the world and agree to be my wife?

94
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,502
No.

95
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,048
Do you think my name is the letter "K"?

96
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,925
Just say yes. If we're married,
legally, you can't arrest me.

97
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,386
Plus, bonus, you can have
the stuff I stole.

98
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,097
Yeah, he just confessed to the robbery.

99
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,474
Damn it!

100
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,562
Ugh. You realize
what the problem is, right?

101
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,314
Yes, but there's no way to help.

102
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,028
Maybe there is.

103
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,865
In the afterlife, they all got better
because they helped each other.

104
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,327
And the key to that was Chidi
and Eleanor's connection.

105
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,829
If I get them together,
everything else will follow.

106
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,373
-Michael, no--
-I'm gonna meet Eleanor someplace

107
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,086
and plant the idea in her mind
that she needs to find Chidi.

108
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,088
And then maybe I'll visit Chidi

109
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,673
and make sure that he helps her
when she shows up.

110
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,384
I'm just gonna nudge the two
of them together. Just nudgy-nudge-nudge.

111
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,096
The Judge was pretty clear
in her instructions.

112
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:33,893
And the Judge is, you know,
the Judge of, you know, the universe.

113
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,478
She'll never find out.

114
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,981
She spends all her time in her chambers
binging TV shows.

115
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,400
She's watching all of <i>NCIS</i> right now.

116
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,654
Hey, there.

117
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,491
Need to head on back to Earth.
[chuckles softly]

118
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,408
Travel papers.

119
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,954
You know, the Judge said
to use the same ones.

120
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,249
'Cause I'm, uh, visiting the same people.

121
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,710
I almost forgot. I brought you
a nice hot cup of antimatter.

122
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,839
I usually only drink decaf antimatter.

123
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,590
-Ah.
-Eh, I'll take it.

124
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,925
It's only 4:30.

125
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,261
-My shift doesn't end till nine billion.
-Ooh.

126
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,099
-What do I owe ya?
-The real question, Eleanor...

127
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,726
is what do we owe to each other?

128
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,688
[Chidi through laptop]
<i>"What do we owe to each other?"</i>

131
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,158

132
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,160
"Anagonye," and yes.

133
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,912
Great. Hi, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

134
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,165
Can we talk?

135
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,294
-Sure.
-Okay, uh, where do I start?

136
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:45,006
I'm not, like, the best person
in the world.

137
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,885
I'm a trash bag from Arizona,
which is saying something.

138
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,554
Our biggest exports
are racist sheriffs and HPV.

139
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,557
But about a year ago,
something crazy happened.

140
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,641
-And I--
-[knock on door]

141
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,727
[both speaking French]

142
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,736
Sorry, I've been flying for 40 hours.
This is Australia, right?

143
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,323
Yes, I grew up in Senegal
so my native language is French.

144
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,782
But I went to American school

145
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,409
-so I also speak English.
-Oh.

146
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,663
And German, and Greek and Latin,
just in case it ever comes back.

147
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,334
Cool. I once got 12 out of 12
on a BuzzFeed quiz called,

148
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,378
"Do you know all the slang words
the Kardashians invented?"

149
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,339
-Congratulations?
-Thank you.

150
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,132
I'm gonna be honest. I did cheat.

151
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,051
You were saying
something crazy happened to you.

152
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,262
Yes. Uh, I almost died.

153
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,391
And it made me wanna become
a better person, which I did, for a while,

154
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,561
but then I fell back into my old,
trash-bag ways.

155
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,106
Yesterday, I saw your lecture
and something just clicked.

156
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,569
[stammers] You flew all the way here
from Arizona just to see me?

157
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,238
Don't flatter yourself, pal.

158
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,200
Sorry, that's a knee-jerk reaction.
Yes, that's exactly what I did.

159
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:59,080
And I know that seems zonkatronic...
That's Khloe's word for crazy.

160
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:04,210
But I need someone to help guide me,
morally speaking.

161
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,797
And I think I need it to be you.

162
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,385
What do you say?
Will you help me become a good person?

163
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:16,973
Yes.

164
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,057
[chuckles softly]

165
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,769
[gasps]

166
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,359
I'll start you off with
some introductory philosophy books,

167
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,236
and then we'll meet here once a week?

168
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,113
Great. Ideally, some of those books

169
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,907
will have been made into a movie
or maybe a funny GIF...

170
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,867
but anything is good with me, man.

171
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,787
-Can I ask you something?
-Mmm-hmm.

172
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,164
Why are you helping me?

173
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,209
I'm a teacher, that's my job.

174
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,627
Yeah, but I'm not your student.

175
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,755
I'm just some hot rando
who walked in off the street.

176
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,591
There's gotta be another reason.

177
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,927
Yes, there is. Um...

178
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,431
-I also had a near-death experience.
-Whoa.

179
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,349
I don't know for sure
that I would have died,

180
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,809
but it was pretty nuts.

181
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,812
I'm... I'm sorry, but this is
an important moment in our--

182
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,732
-On your right, pal!
-Ah, jeez, watch it, man!

183
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,650
Ahh!

184
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,736
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

185
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,488
That... that is right where
I was standing.

186
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,241
I was frozen here,
unable to make a simple decision.

187
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,202
And I almost got crushed
by an air conditioner.

188
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,454
This is a sign.

189
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,791
I shouldn't be using air conditioners.
The Freon is awful for the environment.

190
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,669
That's the lesson you take from this?

191
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,466
Chidi, your brain is broken.
You need to fix your brain.

192
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,305
[Chidi] <i>So, in a nutshell, </i>
<i>I have a 3,600-page thesis</i>

193
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,140
that I am nowhere near finishing.

194
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,768
I am absolutely paralyzed
by decision-making

195
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,811
and it is destroying my life.

196
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,482
Yeah, I sorta got that when
you couldn't choose a chair to sit on.

197
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,485
Well, I... I didn't wanna offend you
in case you had a favorite.

198
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,655
Look, I know I just kinda... No.

199
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,115
...walked in here
and you don't know me at all.

200
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,995
But is there any way to tell
if my indecision is due to a brain thing?

201
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,956
Oh, yeah, sure. Now what we do is,

202
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,627
we make a lengthy incision from
your eyebrows to the nape of your neck,

203
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,297
and we peel your face back, right,
and slice your skull open,

204
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,967
and I just randomly stab at your brain
with an electrified needle.

205
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,471
The fun part is,
you're awake the whole time.

206
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,265
Uh...

207
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,850
I'm kidding. Nah!

208
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,935
I'll just give you an MRI

209
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,145
and look at the part of your brain
that controls decision-making.

210
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,483
Oh, I want that.
I need to learn about my brain. Please.

211
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,445
Well, so you just march
into my office unannounced,

212
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,448
tell me your brain is broken,
and demand I drop everything

213
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,910
and just put you in the university's
$3 million MRI machine?

214
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,164
-Oh, I'm sorry, I just--
-I freakin' love it.

215
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,083
You're so weird. Let's go.

216
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,377
-Right now?
-Oh, yeah, come on.

217
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,294
[Chidi] Okay.

218
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,341
[Simone] This is your hippocampus.
It regulates memory.

219
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,093
Yours looks great. Very strong.

220
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,554
-Gorgeous hippocampus there.
-[both chuckle]

221
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,473
[Simone] This is your
ventromedial prefrontal cortex,

222
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,434
the center of decision-making.

223
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,020
This is where the magic happens.
Do you see how it's all lit up?

224
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,689
That's a flurry of activity

225
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,941
that occurred when I asked you
to choose between red and blue,

226
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:14,900
and you almost passed out.

227
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,485
Is it too late to pick blue?

228
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,029
It is, yeah.

229
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,324
Point is, at first glance,
your brain is very healthy.

230
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:27,580
Oh, there are actual answers here.
Data you can observe and learn from.

231
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,499
Yeah, man.
Science is all about getting answers.

232
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,793
You philosophers
can spend your entire life

233
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,587
mulling over a single question.

234
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,046
That's why everyone hates

235
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,798
-moral philosophy professors.
-[both chuckle]

236
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,009
-No offense.
-None taken. We suck.

237
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,886
-Yeah.
-[both laugh]

238
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,853
-Chidi.
-One blueberry muffin, please.

239
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,982
[Chidi] <i>Why choose to be good? Every day?</i>

240
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,320
<i>I argue that we choose to be good</i>
<i>because of our bonds with other people. </i>

241
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,907
Simply put, we are not in this alone.

242
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,325
Thank you.

243
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,035
[audience applauds]

244
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:10,414
Wow, Chidi. You chose that muffin
in less than a minute.

245
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,959
That beats your old record by 59 minutes.

246
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,504
Henry, I feel amazing.

247
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,464
I am 100 pages into my new thesis,

248
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,591
and it is some of the best writing
that I have ever done.

249
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,384
I haven't been this happy since...

250
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,431
Oh, wow, I've never been happy. Huh!

251
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,559
-Bad!
-I'm proud of you, mate.

252
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,144
Must be really nice to live that way.

253
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,647
Well, that's the beauty of it.
Anyone can live this way.

254
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,358
Just decide to be more decisive.

255
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,151
What's something that you
always wanted to do?

256
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,946
I have been putting off getting in shape.

257
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,866
Then make the decision to wake up
tomorrow morning and get in shape.

258
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,243
It is that easy.

259
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,537
Okay. Maybe I will.

260
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,454
What have you got to lose?

261
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,789
-Nothing!
-[both laugh]

262
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,959
Henry, what happened to you?

263
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,628
Well, I was using
the leg press at the gym,

264
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,798
and you know how your legs
bend a certain way?

265
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,051
-My legs bend the other way now.
-Oh, no.

266
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,720
All the tendons in my legs
snapped like violin strings.

267
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,514
And then my foot flew forwards,

268
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,267
and I kicked myself in the face,
which gave me a concussion.

269
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,728
But on the bright side,
I lost control of my bladder,

270
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,564
someone got it on video,

271
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:22,611
and now "leg-press whizzer"
has 62,000 views on YouTube.

272
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,905
I'm famous.

273
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,366
This is all my fault. I did this to you.

274
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,995
Uh-uh. Muffins.
I brought blueberry muffins.

275
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,330
Oh, no, you shouldn't eat
blueberries anymore.

276
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,625
I read an article. The migrant workers
who pick them are horribly mistreated.

277
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,422
Gah!

278
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,509
Morning, Chidi. Blueberry muffin for ya?

279
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,012
Uh, I don't know. Maybe. I can't decide.

280
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,681
-You all right there, mate?
-Okay, I've made my decision.

281
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,850
I want to...

282
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,519
start crying.

283
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,776
Excuse me, what is the maximum number
of books that I can check out?

284
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,861
Is it 12,000?

285
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,571
Got a wild weekend planned?

286
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,740
I need to find a new topic for my thesis,

287
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,867
and this thing happened
that made me more decisive,

288
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,411
and a few months ago, my friend broke
both his legs. It's my fault.

289
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,996
And blueberries. And I need help.

290
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,457
-Whoo! [laughs]
-Maybe that help will come from

291
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,627
{\an8}Tay Zonday's autobiography <i>Chocolate Book!</i>

292
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,878
{\an8}[chuckling] I mean, who's to say?

293
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,923
Mate, I've worked in this library
a long time,

294
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,051
and I've seen a lot of academic types

295
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,428
with that same helpless look
on their faces.

296
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,388
They all made it through okay.

297
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,266
Once they learned the secret.

298
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,935
What's the secret?
There's a secret?

299
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,770
Is the secret more books?
How many more books do I need?

300
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,940
It's not about books, mate.
It's about perspective.

301
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,233
Sometimes, when you're feeling helpless,

302
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,070
the secret is to help someone else,
get out of your own head.

303
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,446
Trust me.

304
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,531
Next time someone asks for help...

305
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,992
say yes.

306
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,414
A few hours later, you walked in
and asked for help.

307
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,626
Now, I don't know if this is
going to solve all of my problems,

308
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,504
but it's worth a try. Right?

309
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,298
Well, thank you, sexy librarian guy.

310
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,509
I didn't say he was sexy.

311
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,053
I know, but whenever anyone tells me
a story about their life,

312
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,430
I always imagine all the people
as being super hot.

313
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,890
Otherwise, I quickly lose interest.

314
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,227
Do you not do that?
You can do it for free.

315
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:24,024
I gotta say, I enjoyed playing the role
of mysterious librarian,

316
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,277
and I really... [in bad accent]
Nailed the Australian accent.

317
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,863
-Uh-huh. Flawless.
-Thank you.

318
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:34,201
But the point is, Eleanor and Chidi
are together, and now we can relax.

319
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,537
Everything is finally on track.

320
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,211
Status report.

321
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,839
They're plugging away, but we still can't
hack into the Judge's system.

322
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,048
[Shawn] Damn it!

323
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,843
Those four humans
have been on Earth for over a year.

324
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,345
I need to know if they're getting better.

325
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,596
Can I just ask?

326
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,143
We torture 30 billion humans.
Why do you care so much about these four?

327
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,565
Never mind. Forget I asked.

328
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,235
[Todd] Serves him right
for questioning you, boss.

329
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,570
I think you're doing a great job.

330
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,654
Thank you, Todd.

331
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,573
[Todd] No, no, no, no--

332
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:16,118
-Why did you do that?
-I'm a demon. It's fun.

333
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,580
No one leaves this room
until we've accessed the Judge's system.

334
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,416
Would music help?
Should I play some music?

335
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,587
Good idea. Choose something
deeply terrible to inspire us.

336
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,634
["Right Here Waiting" by Richard Marx
playing through speakers]

337
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,179
Oh, yeah. That's the stuff.

338
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,809
So, for Aristotle, virtue is practical.

339
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,312
Goodness isn't something
that a person inherently has.

340
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,565
It's something that she achieves
through her actions.

341
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,401
-Questions?
-Uh, yeah, a few.

342
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,154
I wrote down, "What? Huh?"

343
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,824
And then this doodle of a burrito
because when I first read Aristotle,

344
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,910
I thought it was pronounced
like "Chipotle."

345
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,704
Wait a minute.
Is it "chip-a-tottle"?

346
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,165
These are all great questions,

347
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,460
but I have to meet
my thesis advisor across campus.

348
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,962
Oh. Uh, I'm headed that way, too.
I'll walk with you.

349
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,464
Hey, so...

350
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,635
I've been trying to figure out
how to pay you back for helping me.

351
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,720
I told you, you don't owe me anything.

352
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,723
At home, when I want get something nice
for one of my friends,

353
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,601
it usually comes
in the form of something...

354
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,230
edible. You get what I'm saying?
An edible thing?

355
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,607
-Please don't buy me drugs.
-Okay, copy that.

356
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,069
I had no choice. I was in his driveway
taking pictures when he walked out,

357
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,822
so I said,
"Hey, Mr. Crowe, I'm from the gas company.

358
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,156
I loved you in <i>Gladiator."</i>

359
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,950
-Chidi! Hey!
-[Chidi] Hey!

360
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:38,951
I got a question.

361
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,162
Is it, "What's my thesis topic?"
Because I still don't know.

362
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,205
[chuckling] No, it's not that.

363
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,750
Oh, I'm sorry, you guys haven't met yet.

364
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,001
Simone, this is Eleanor.

365
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,171
-The famous Simone. Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

366
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,383
So, I've got to do some MRI scans
as a control for an experiment,

367
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,301
and since you loved it so much last time,

368
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,679
I was wondering if you could just
pop back in there, help me out?

369
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,013
-Oh, absolutely.
-Cool.

370
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,932
Okay, well, just come by my lab at 6:00,

371
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,809
and then afterwards,
I can buy you dinner as a thank you.

372
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,811
Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that.

373
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,231
Oh. Okay. Well, I'll see you later.

374
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,066
-Nice to meet you. Yeah.
-You, too.

375
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,571
-What?
-Uh...

376
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,866
You and Simone have some real
professor-dork vibes flowing.

377
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,286
You're both teachers...
who are hot for teacher. [squeals]

378
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,705
How have you not asked her out yet?

379
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,081
-Are you scared?
-No.

380
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,333
It's not impressive to guess
that I'm scared, Eleanor.

381
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,546
I'm scared of everything,
and I can't just do things like that.

382
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,381
-Just drop it, okay?
-Well--

383
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,258
Just promise me you'll drop it.

384
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,595
Okay. I promise.

385
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,431
So, you're into Chidi, right?

386
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,976
Forgive my bluntness,
but I'm usually right about these things.

387
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,146
Yeah, but I made it pretty clear
a bunch of times,

388
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,357
and he's never responded,
so I assumed he wasn't interested.

389
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,942
[Chidi] Okay, I'm all set.

390
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,653
[Simone] I'm just gonna ask you
some basic questions, Chidi.

391
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,031
-What is one plus one?
-Two.

392
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,533
-[Simone] What color is the sky?
-[Chidi] Blue.

393
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,785
-What color are Simone's eyes?
-Brown.

394
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,454
[stammers] What?

395
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,083
If you could take Simone anywhere
on a date, where would you take her?

396
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,544
Sorry, is this part of the experiment?

397
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,963
It is now, yes.
Please answer the question.

398
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,132
And keep in mind we can see your brain.

399
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,508
Next question.

400
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,676
You are into Simone.

401
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,802
That's not a question.

402
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,763
So, you agree it's a fact.

403
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,097
Next question's for Simone.

404
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,309
Simone, are you annoyed at Chidi
for waiting so long to ask you out?

405
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,227
Yes, I am.

406
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,686
[Eleanor] Chidi, same question for you.

407
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,357
Are you annoyed at yourself
for waiting so long to ask out Simone?

408
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,235
I'm annoyed with you
and I've only known you three weeks.

409
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,238
[Chidi] Yes, I am obviously
very annoyed with myself.

410
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,032
-Can I get out now?
-No, you can't. It'll ruin the science.

411
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,744
There's only one question left,
and you gotta ask it, bud.

412
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,583
Simone, would you like
to have dinner with me?

413
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,503
-That is highly inappropriate.
-[chuckles]

414
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,921
-Uh...
-I'm just kidding.

415
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,965
-Yes, I would. Thank you for asking.
-[laughs]

416
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,300
Oh, cute.

417
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,677
This is a disaster.

418
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,970
Michael, relax.

419
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,471
How are the two of them gonna bond?

420
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,683
There were plenty of reboots where
Eleanor and Chidi weren't even soulmates,

421
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,518
and he still always helped her.

422
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,104
Simone and Chidi are good together.

423
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,023
I've been running simulations
on what their kids will be like.

424
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,776
One of them is hot enough
to be on <i>The Bachelor,</i>

425
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,487
and smart enough
to never go on <i>The Bachelor.</i>

426
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,447
This is not just about Chidi.

427
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,574
I have left too much to chance.

428
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:29,079
Until our group is back together again,
this whole thing is hanging by a thread.

429
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,163
I'm going back down.

430
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,957
You're pressing your luck.

431
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,793
If you keep disobeying Mommy,
something bad is going to happen.

432
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,003
What?

433
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,963
I don't have a mom,
so I've been experimenting

434
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,008
with thinking of the Judge as my mom.
[chuckles]

435
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,051
-It's weird. Forget it.
-Okay.

436
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,137
How are you even gonna get
Jason and Tahani to Australia?

437
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,681
I have no idea, but I have to try.

438
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,599
Well, good luck, Dad.

439
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,351
Nope. Also weird. Just go.

440
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,313
Hey, bud.

441
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,607
Brought you some
decaf hazelnut antimatter.

442
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,360
Just a little treat for my old pal,
the Doorman.

443
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,946
Heading back down, by the way.
[clears throat]

444
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,825
You sure the Judge is okay with you
going back to Earth so many times?

445
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,537
Oh, yeah, yeah, all good.
See? Still got the papers.

446
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,164
Shouldn't be long.

447
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,172
[typing]

448
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,549
How we doing, Steve?

449
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,634
-I'm trying. I'm getting close.
-[computer beeping]

450
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,512
Good. No pressure.

451
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,474
-[typing]
-[computer chiming]

452
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,226
Ah-ha. Someone just went down to Earth,

453
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,771
and that gave me a backdoor
to the Judge's system.

454
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,772
Now we can see everything

455
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,191
that's happening
with all four humans. [sighs]

456
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,275
[gasps]

457
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,194
-Excellent work, Steve.
-[sighs]

458
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,949
Uh-oh. Looks like
someone's been cocooning again. [chuckles]

459
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,242
It would be a real help

460
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,952
if you let me know
next time you're about to--

461
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,709
Well, well, well.

462
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:01,004
Looks like Michael's been caught
with his hand in the human jar.

463
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,130
[Glenn] Good one, boss!

464
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,381
Shut up, Glenn!

465
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,637
Morning, teach!
Ready to discuss philosophy.

466
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,223
Obviously, I'm kidding.
How was your date with Simone?

467
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,517
-Spill it, sweetheart.
-We had a great time.

468
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,770
Thank you, again, for bullying me
into asking her out.

469
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,438
Well, I owed it to you.

470
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,859
{\an8}And bonus, I realized
I was practicing virtue ethics

471
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,320
{\an8}by helping the two of you bone down.

472
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,740
Okay, not appropriate. Also not
a great understanding of virtue ethics.

473
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,493
-We can agree to disagree.
-But, if you must know,

474
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,662
it was very chaste. We didn't even kiss.

475
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,332
-Because you chickened out?
-I did, yeah.

476
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,794
I totally chickened out,
and I am so mad at myself.

477
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:44,005
Well, maybe it wasn't the right moment.

478
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,549
Knowing the two of you nerds,

479
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,592
your first kiss is gonna be while reading

480
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,512
-Plato in an MRI machine.
-[chuckles]

481
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,558
Oh. Hang on. Come with me.

482
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,395
Simone, what's the one thing
Eleanor and I have in common?

483
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,522
You both have a complete disregard
for my office hours.

484
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,399
-Sorry, Reginald.
-Ah, no worries.

485
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,860
-Look, Eleanor is an Arizona trash bag...
-Yep.

486
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,069
-...her words, not mine...
-Totally.

487
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,029
...who once told me
that her greatest accomplishment

488
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,407
was breaking into Charles Barkley's house.

489
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,577
He was on the road.
I snuck in through the doggie door,

490
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,038
tried on all his giant shoes.
One of my top five Christmases.

491
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:21,835
[stammers] Listen, the point is,
Eleanor and I have nothing in common,

492
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,589
except that we both almost died
and it made us wanna be better people.

493
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,382
This is my thesis idea.

494
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:32,637
I will explore the effect of near-death
experiences on ethical decision-making.

495
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,891
I will get a group of people together
who've had near-death experiences,

496
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,977
ask them ethical questions,
and see if there's any commonalities!

497
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,270
That's great.

498
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,897
Why are you yelling it at me?

499
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,276
Because I need your help.
You and your magic brain-scan machine!

500
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,447
Oh! Of course! A joint study
with the neuroscience department!

501
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,449
We can use MRI mapping to see

502
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,201
if a near-death experience
alters brain function.

503
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,660
[Chidi] There's something there, right?

504
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,953
[Simone] Definitely. I love this.

505
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,997
Great. Also, I wanted to kiss you
last night, but I chickened out,

506
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,915
so I'm gonna kiss you now.

507
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,166
Good. Yes, I want that, please.

508
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,674
Oh. Sorry, Reginald. What were you saying?

509
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:13,094
Um, that I can't come to class tomorrow
'cause my grandma died?

510
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,306
Oof! Real mood-ruiner.

511
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,099
Read the room, dude.

512
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,317
Bingo.

513
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,318
Okay.

514
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,530
{\an8}Good, you're here.
Eleanor, meet the newest member

515
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,533
of our ethical neuroscientific study,
Tahani Al-Jamil.

516
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,953
Hello, Eleanor. Delighted to meet you.

517
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,371
"Al-Jamil."

518
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,915
Oh, you're Kamilah's sister.

519
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,500
I am, yes.

520
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,628
If you want an autograph or something,
I could probably arrange it.

521
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,130
Eh. I was never really that into her.
No offense.

522
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,094
[chuckling] Oh, I assure you,
there is none taken.

523
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,805
So, how did you come to join our team?

524
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:02,352
Well, it's a bit of a story, I suppose.
It began about a year ago.

525
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,065
[Tahani] Come down!
Come down, where you belong!

526
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,108
[screams]

527
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,819
[crowd gasps]

528
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,404
[Tahani] Oh.

529
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,614
Well done, Tahani.

530
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,699
Who saved me?

531
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,326
Did anyone see who just saved my life?

532
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,870
-[woman 1] It was Kamilah.
-No, it was a man, I think.

533
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,956
-[woman 2] It was Kamilah!
-[man 1] It was Kamilah!

534
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,292
-No! It wasn't Kamilah!
-[man 2] It was Kamilah!

535
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,626
It was someone over there.

536
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,754
[crowd chanting]
Kamilah! Kamilah! Kamilah!

537
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,465
Kamilah! Kamilah! Kamilah!

538
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,092
[Tahani] <i>I had almost died.</i>

539
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:39,139
<i>In that very moment,</i>
<i>I decided to change my life.</i>

540
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,350
<i>First, I cleansed myself</i>
<i>of all the worldly possessions </i>

541
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,853
<i>that had been weighing</i>
<i>me down like anchors.</i>

542
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,356
<i>The dresses, the jewels,</i>
<i>I gave them all to Good Will.</i>

543
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,567
That's what I call Prince William.

544
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,152
Since he'd married a commoner,

545
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:56,072
I assumed he'd know
some needy people they could go to.

546
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,615
Sure.

547
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,036
[Tahani] <i>Then, I deleted</i>
<i>all my celebrity contacts from my mobile.</i>

548
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,954
Goodbye, Bono.

549
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,081
Goodbye, The Edge.

550
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,627
{\an8}Goodbye, The Edge's real phone number
that even Bono doesn't have.

551
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:14,132
{\an8}And most importantly, I put physical
distance between me and my old life.

552
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:18,011
Book me a flight to Tibet.
I'm going to live in a Buddhist monastery.

553
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,596
I need to get out of the spotlight.

554
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,265
Copy that.
I'll see what jets are available.

555
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,434
No. I'm flying commercial.

556
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,644
-Okay. First class, I assume?
-No.

557
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,356
I'm a woman of the people now.

558
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,901
Comfort plus.

559
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,573
<i>And there, in that humble monastery,</i>

560
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:42,619
<i>thousands of miles from</i>
<i>the meaningless concerns of high society,</i>

561
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,455
<i>I embarked upon a quest for enlightenment.</i>

562
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,376
<i>I learned to embrace a life of simplicity.</i>

563
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,919
<i>I meditated.</i>

564
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,463
<i>I worked.</i>

565
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,299
<i>I gave back to Mother Earth.</i>

566
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,385
<i>And I slept.</i>

567
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,722
<i>My soul had never felt so nourished.</i>

568
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:06,851
<i>Until one day, my former life came</i>
<i>knocking at the open space</i>

569
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,271
<i>where a door would have been,</i>
<i>if we were given any privacy.</i>

570
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,108
Yo! Is that Tahani Al-Jamil?

571
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,110
Man, it totes is you!

572
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,362
What up? I'm Colby. <i>Squalor News.</i>

573
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,990
What are you doing in this monastery?

574
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,202
We're doing a new show about poverty,
drug lords, gun running,

575
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,413
weird-ass restaurants,
skateboarding and...

576
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,124
and also genocide.
It's called <i>Society is Effed!</i>

577
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,458
What are you doing here, though?

578
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,419
Is this where you came
after your sister saved your life?

579
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:37,924
[sighs] I am living here as a way
to shed my desire for attention.

580
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,802
Tight! That's what's up.
You gotta shed that, right?

581
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,762
But listen, if you ever want us to do

582
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,724
a monster profile
on you and your monk junk,

583
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,308
we would be honored AF.

584
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,688
I think people would be supes interested
in what you're doing here. For real.

585
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,315
Look, here's my card.
Think about it.

586
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,277
[Tahani] <i>Of course, I never called him</i>
<i>to do that profile,</i>

587
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,740
<i>because I didn't pursue a life of</i>
<i>tranquility to get in front of a camera.</i>

588
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,826
<i>I did it... to get out of the spotlight.</i>

589
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,620
And that's what my book is about,

590
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,207
shedding your need
for validation from others!

591
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,961
[audience applauding]

592
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,884
{\an8}Publisher says you'll hit
two million copies sold by next week.

593
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,637
Your <i>582 Questions With... </i>video
was nominated for a BAFTA.

594
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,555
That's fun.

595
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,558
-Also, they want you for <i>Oprah.</i>
<i>-Oprah's</i> off the air.

596
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,602
No, they want you to take over for Oprah.

597
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,272
Also, this investor wants to meet you.
I checked him out. He's legit.

598
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:35,982
[Michael] Tahani.

599
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,067
Gordon Indigo.

600
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,279
I just have to say, you are so inspiring.

601
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,282
Aw. [chuckles]
Namaste.

602
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,826
I mean, you really have
all these idiots fooled.

603
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,994
Excuse me?

604
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:51,790
Listen, I'm sure you're already rolling
in dough from this incredible scam,

605
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,460
but have you thought about merch?
Because we could partner here.

606
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,588
I made a fortune selling Nirvana orbs.

607
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,672
Which is to say...

608
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,927
driving range golf balls
that I painted silver.

609
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,763
-That's awful.
-No, it's healing.

610
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,389
Wink. [chuckles]

611
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,267
You should be selling
whatever crap you can think of,

612
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,435
'cause these people will buy it.

613
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,853
-That is quite enough!
-Hmm?

614
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,147
And how dare you insinuate
that I'm not authentic.

615
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,525
-I've finished signing your headshots.
-Oh, not now.

616
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:23,029
Miss Al-Jamil, it's okay.
You and I are the same.

617
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,031
I love what you're doing here.

618
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,950
You get to be rich and famous,

619
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,911
and not have to do
any of the work of helping people.

620
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,913
But I am helping people.

621
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,790
You need to go. Right now!

622
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,918
Suit yourself. All right.
If you change your mind, I'm online.

623
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,630
Just google "crystals that prevent
erectile dysfunction."

624
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,881
[scoffs]

625
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,593
I'm sorry, but Miss Al-Jamil
doesn't have time to participate

626
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,138
in an ethical study
at some random university.

627
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:53,434
If you want to meet her, you can sign up
for the "Get Out of the Spotlight" cruise,

628
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,354
with special guests
Deepak Chopra and Will.i.am.

629
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,274
Hello?

630
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,860
This is Tahani Al-Jamil.

631
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,862
[Chidi] <i>Hi, I didn't think</i>
<i>I'd actually get you.</i>

632
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:08,199
My name is Chidi Anagonye,
and I'm doing an academic study

633
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,744
on near-death experiences
and ethical decision-making.

634
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,455
<i>-I read an article about you--</i>
-Will it help people?

635
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,791
That's all I want to know.
Will this help people?

636
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,751
Yes, I... I think so.

637
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,296
I mean... that's the goal.

638
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,257
Send me the info.
I'll be there tomorrow morning.

639
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,217
[indistinct chatter]

640
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,302
Wow!

641
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,680
But how had you learned
about me, I wonder?

642
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:34,183
A professor I'd never heard of
named Charles Brainman

643
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,896
sent me an article about you.
Said you'd be perfect for our study.

644
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,814
Well, welcome to Australia.

645
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,442
Oh, if you need a place to crash
while you get settled,

646
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,068
my motel has a pullout sofa.

647
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,989
Although, as I say that,
and I look at you and your whole thing,

648
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,242
I realize that's absurd, and you should
probably just get your own place.

649
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,954
Yes, I... I think that's, uh... best.
[chuckles]

650
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,039
But... but thank you!

651
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:56,956
Mmm-hmm.

652
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,252
Three down...

653
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,588
one to go.

654
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,969
-[water splashes]
-'Sup, bud? I've been looking for you.

655
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,764
-Oh, sorry, are these your rocks?
-Nah.

656
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:17,060
Look, my name is Zack Pizazz,
international talent scout.

657
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,188
I've been tracking your dance troupe, man.

658
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,648
I think you really got the goods.

659
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,193
I want you to come on down
to Australia and start a new crew.

660
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,694
All right? I'll pay for everything.

661
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,655
May have a few other obligations,
but, basically--

662
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,533
Uh, thanks, but no thanks, man.
I'm done with dancing.

663
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,160
But... Whoa-oh-oh.

664
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,204
You... you heard what my name was, right?

665
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,247
Zack Pizazz?

666
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,834
My life is just kinda messed up right now.
I had a really tough year.

667
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,213
-[water splashes]
-I'm sorry.

668
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,966
Want to talk about it?
I'm a pretty good listener.

669
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:53,721
Well, my year started about a year ago...

670
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,849
[exhales] Pillboi?

671
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,059
[hysterically] I can't breathe
and I'm freaking out

672
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,061
and I'm almost out of Whip-Its! Pillboi!

673
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,022
-[in Italian] <i>Buongiorno! Buongiorno.</i>
-[knocking on safe door]

674
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:05,942
[groans]

675
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,988
-Yo, what happened?
-[panting] I couldn't breathe!

676
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,656
The snorkel must have been broken.

677
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,949
Yo, that sucks.

678
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,159
You ready to get back in there?

679
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,744
Nah, man.

680
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,372
We're not doing this no more.

681
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,874
I almost died trying to rob
a Mexican restaurant.

682
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,044
I have to change my life.

683
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,134
I know what I'm gonna do.

684
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,558
{\an8}I'm gonna win this dance competition!

685
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,477
So, you didn't see
any other posters there?

686
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,104
No. Don't think so. Why?

687
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,231
Doesn't matter. Continue.

688
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:51,029
[Jason] Homies, I almost died yesterday,
but we've been given a second chance.

689
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,032
Three months from today,
on this very stage,

690
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,367
in the Carmen Electra Auditorium,

691
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,287
right here at the Smith &amp; Wesson
Performing Arts Center

692
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,788
and ATV Repair Shop,

693
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,209
we are going to win
this dance competition.

694
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,378
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Jason] "How," you ask?

695
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,130
By working!

696
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:13,092
We are going to eat, breathe
and vape dance.

697
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,054
I want you thinking about dance 24/7.

698
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:20,933
That means every day, you think
20 thoughts about dance for seven minutes,

699
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,060
-and if you can't promise me...
-[indistinct chatter]

700
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,771
...that you'll give this dance crew
everything that you've got,

701
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,856
then you can walk out that door...

702
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,275
right now.

703
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,320
Yeah. Okay, I'm out.

704
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,279
What?

705
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,573
Come on, Donkey Doug,
after all we've been through?

706
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:39,077
Listen, you know you're my boy,
but this sounds like a lot of work.

707
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,078
Good luck.

708
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,081
[both] Pew-pew.

709
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,459
Donkey Doug, out!

710
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,838
Damn. That's a tough blow,

711
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,925
but now that those guys
are no longer members of our crew,

712
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,968
we can legally rob their houses!

713
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,679
No, Li'l Peanut,
we're gonna do this the right way.

714
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,847
-No more crime.
-[sighs]

715
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,935
And if you don't like that,
you can walk out that door... right now.

716
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,313
[indistinct chatter]

717
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,857
[Jason] What? Come on!

718
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,112
We still got, like, 35 people,
so let's get to work.

719
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,823
[audience applauding]

720
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,740
Quick announcement.

721
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:23,704
Will the owner of a 1998 Toyota Tercel
with golden pythons painted on both sides,

722
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,834
license plate "GOT MILF,"
please see an usher?

723
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,585
Your car has exploded.

724
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,462
All right, y'all ready for the next act?

725
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:36,134
Please give it up right now
for Dance Dance Resolution!

726
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,386
[audience cheering and applauding]

727
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,804
[dubstep music playing]

728
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,281
In the six-year history
of this competition,

729
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,701
no crew has ever received
a perfect score from our judges.

730
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,619
That changed tonight.

731
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,037
But before we get to that,

732
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,291
Dance Dance Resolution
has been disqualified.

733
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,252
What? No! Why?

734
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:15,381
Because you have 40 people on stage.
The limit is eight.

735
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,759
Also, one of your members
tried to carjack me on my way in here.

736
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,138
No, that was Donkey Doug, and he's not
a part of our crew anymore.

737
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,682
We win! We win! We win!

738
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,268
-[all] We win! We win! We win!
-No.

739
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,437
Again, you are disqualified.

740
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,816
[woman 1] And the winner is...
Panther Blood!

741
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,154
[man] And the winner is... Suck Monsters.

742
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:42,283
-[woman 2] And the winner is... nobody.
-[audience groans]

743
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,077
[woman 2] All teams are disqualified
due to violence.

744
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,582
Okay, well, we're out of rent money.

745
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:53,044
So, remember that thing
I said about "no more crime"?

746
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,297
That's over now. Go do crime.

747
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,008
Yeah, he just confessed to the robbery.

748
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,551
-Damn it.
-[cop over radio]<i> That was easy.</i>

749
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,428
Look, please let me go.

750
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,389
I only did it to pay rent
for my dance crew's rehearsal space.

751
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,807
Oh, then, you're in luck.

752
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,894
We only arrest people for robbery
if they don't have a reason.

753
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,189
[Pillboi] Sorry it took me so long
to bail you out.

754
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,316
Nah, it was my fault.

755
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,653
I shouldn't have used my one phone call
to prank the police department.

756
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,906
Man, a year ago, I almost died,

757
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,743
and I'm exactly the same
as I was before. A failure.

758
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,621
You're not a failure.
You're a dreamer.

759
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,624
Look, I like my job at the old folks home.

760
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,584
Those old biddies are sweet,

761
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:38,631
and sometimes they give me what they think
are candy, but are really loose Vicodin.

762
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,052
But when I'm with you,
I feel like the sky's the limit.

763
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:47,431
I feel like someday
I'll be able to buy my own Vicodin...

764
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:52,144
and it'll never turn out
to actually be laxatives.

765
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:57,566
Thanks, dog, but if my life ended today,
what would my legacy be?

766
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,696
Sure, I did a wheelie on a dirt bike
through an entire Waffle House.

767
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,950
And I was once interviewed on the news
for finding a foot on the beach.

768
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,288
But, yo, other than that,
I have no truly great accomplishments.

769
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,583
Bro, I'm only saying this
because I love you.

770
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,129
Do you want a Vicodin right now?

771
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:23,217
So I walked out of that bar,
came down to this wharf,

772
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,804
threw a rock at a snake,
met a guy named Zack Pizazz,

773
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,015
talked to him about my crazy year
that I've had,

774
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,600
which started when I was locked in a safe.

775
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,020
No, that was me. I'm Zack Pizazz.

776
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,439
-We're caught up now.
-Oh, yeah.

777
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,565
[laughs]

778
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,651
A year ago, if you had asked me to run
a dance crew in Atlantis...

779
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,404
-Australia.
-...I would have said yes for sure.

780
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:48,075
But now, and I know this sounds crazy,

781
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,746
but I'm starting to think
there might be more to life

782
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,415
than amateur street-dancing competitions.

783
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,252
It's funny, but I know
exactly what you mean.

784
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,757
My goal in life used to be
completely different, too.

785
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:08,679
I used to rep this crew called The Demons.

786
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,723
Whoa! I remember you guys!

787
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,518
Didn't you all die when someone brought
a hammerhead shark into your hot tub?

788
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:20,358
Different Demons. The point is, I had to
leave my old crew behind, you know?

789
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:26,113
But I met new friends
who helped me become a better person.

790
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,701
Look, I know this group of people
who are also searching for meaning.

791
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,245
They might be able to help you
find what you're looking for.

792
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,122
What do you think?
You wanna meet 'em?

793
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,459
Yeah, that sounds great.

794
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,545
Do we have to leave right now?

795
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,841
My friend gave me a pill that I realized
one second ago was definitely a laxative.

796
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,967
No, go, go!

797
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,932
Well, that is the last time
I'll need to head back down there.

798
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,852
So to thank you for your help,
I brought you back something from Earth.

799
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,938
A little token of my appreciation.

800
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:03,567
It keeps your antimatter
warmer for longer.

801
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,907
-It's a frog.
-Yeah.

802
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,034
-There's a frog on it.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

803
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:16,455
Right there, it's a frog!
Man, it's green. It's classic.

804
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,417
This guy's a jumper, you can tell.
Thank you!

805
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,501
You're welcome.

806
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,464
Wow, that really went over big.

807
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,929
-How's Jason? Is he still cute?
-He looks about the same.

808
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,013
That sounds cute!

809
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,306
-[chuckles]
-Hey, guys.

810
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,474
-Oh. Hey, Judge.
-[Janet] Hey!

811
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,017
-Long time no see.
-[laughing]

812
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,436
-[Michael] Yeah.
-How's it going?

813
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,980
So good. I mean,
everything is going according to plan,

814
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,732
and nothing is going
differently from the plan.

815
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,277
Yes, that's a very not-weird way
to put it.

816
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,821
Well, I'm just stretching my legs.

817
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:52,950
-Just binged 300 episodes of <i>NCIS.</i>
-Oof!

818
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:57,830
You know, I'm not a human woman,
but that Mark Harmon can get it.

819
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,373
-Oh.
-You know what I'm saying?

820
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,333
-[Michael and Janet chuckle]
-Speaking of human cutie pies,

821
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,585
how's that Chidi doing?

822
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,794
Oh, sorry, Judge, let me just...

823
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,963
Oh, hey! You know what you would love

824
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,006
-if you like Mark Harmon?
-Uh-huh?

825
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,593

He is very sexy in <i>Stealing Home,</i>

826
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,471
according to the private thoughts of
more than seven million Caucasian women.

827
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,181
Oh. Hot tip.

828
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,183
-Thanks, y'all. You guys wanna come with?
-[chuckles]

829
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,310
-[Michael and Janet] Ooh.
-We can watch together.

830
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,561
I can whip up some nachos.

831
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,022
I am incapable of eating, so...

832
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,149
-Suit yourselves, party poopers!
-[Michael and Janet] Ah.

833
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,484
-[Michael] Party poopers!
-[both laughing]

834
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,527
I guess it'll just be me and Mark then.

835
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,279
-[both laughing]
-Naughty, naughty!

836
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:35,534
[inhales] Oh, boy!
Michael, we almost just got busted.

837
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,494
Yeah, but we didn't.

838
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:40,206
And more importantly,
Jason just arrived in Australia.

839
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,166
The four of them are finally together.

840
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:45,377
Oh, we did it, Janet! We got away with it.

841
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,005
-[sighs]
-Hmm.

842
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,759
So, this is our MRI machine.
Ooh, don't touch that.

843
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,011
Um, each of you will get a chance
in here eventually.

844
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,180
Hopefully, none of you is claustrophobic.

845
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,558
{\an8}Claustrophobic?
Who would ever be scared of Santa Claus?

846
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,269
{\an8}Oh! The Jewish!

847
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:03,771
{\an8}You from Florida?

848
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,606
{\an8}-Jacksonville.
-Yeah.

849
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,857
{\an8}[Tahani] That should be fine for me.

850
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,025
{\an8}It's roughly the same size

851
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,569
{\an8}as Nicole Kidman's cryogenic
anti-aging chamber,

852
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,571
{\an8}and I've never had a problem in there.

853
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,697
{\an8}[Eleanor] I'll be okay, too.

854
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:17,284
{\an8}It kinda reminds me of the home-tanning
booth I lost my virginity in.

855
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,204
{\an8}Wow. I cannot wait
to take a look at these three brains.

856
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,956
{\an8}Oh. Forgot to mention.

857
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,291
{\an8}There's one more person
who will be joining us.

858
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,627
{\an8}Seems like a really interesting guy.

859
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,754
{\an8}He was almost run over by a train
a few months ago,

860
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,297
heard about the study,
emailed me last night.

861
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,175
This doesn't make any sense.

862
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,514
They're all there. What's going on?

863
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,266
Oh, no.

864
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,184
What is it?

865
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:49,149
Something bad, Janet.
Something very dark and evil.

866
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,779
Oh, yes. Come on in.
Everyone, this is Trevor.

867
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:57,783
Hey, guys! It is so great to meet you.
