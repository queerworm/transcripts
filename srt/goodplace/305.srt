1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,546
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's do sophomore year of high school.

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,881
-Uh, Nathan Burlingame.
-Didn't like you.

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,050
Huh. Kylie Mansard?

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,719
Thought you were cool but intimidating.

5
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:15,640
No way! I thought she was intimidating.
That's why I shoved her into that creek.

6
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,561
Well, after my chili episode,
I asked the administration

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,980
for a one-year sabbatical,
and good news...

8
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,606
they fired me.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,193
So, I am free and easy!

10
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,488
Well, the rest of the Soul Squad
is off helping Jason's dad.

11
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,740
Who are we saving?

12
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,284
No one from my high school.
I will tell you that much.

13
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:39,164
Well, before we do anything,
I have to break things off with Simone.

14
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,874
If I slip up
and tell her about the universe,

15
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,168
it could doom her for eternity.

16
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,711
And I've avoided talking to her
for so long,

17
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,088
she assumed I had laryngitis
and it went too far.

18
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,465
Now, I'm on antibiotics.

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
Okay, settle down. Your moral code
means you can't lie, right?

20
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,014
You need to just ghost her.
Disappear, block her number.

21
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:59,642
Bonus, anything she left in your apartment
now legally belongs to you.

22
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,312
I've done that to dozens of people,
and all of them got over it.

23
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,564
Actually, none of your exes
have ever gotten over you.

24
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,899
You're damn right they didn't.

25
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:10,195
I just wish I could end things in a way
that I knew wouldn't hurt her.

26
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,446
[Janet] Bing!

27
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,865
I usually appear out of thin air

28
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,867
and there would be
a pleasant "bing" sound,

29
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,287
but I don't have my powers,
so I'm doing my own bings now.

30
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,497
Bing!

31
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,834
Chidi, what if I could create
a virtual reality simulation

32
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,669
where you could practice
different breakup scenarios?

33
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,379
-You can do that?
-I think so.

34
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,090
I do know everything about you,
and Simone,

35
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,176
and computer programming,
and virtual reality,

36
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,011
and artificial intelligence,
and the human brain,

37
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,846
and everything else!
I'm kind of a nerd.

38
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,558
I'll start building the simulator now.
Bing!

39
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,520
[chuckles softly]

40
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:48,942
Don't... Turn around.
It's embarrassing.

41
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,944
Bing!

42
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,248
[Jason] Jacksonville! What up?

43
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:07,252
-Duval!
-[Floridians] Duval!

44
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,795
{\an8}Poor Larry.

45
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,758
{\an8}But, "If you love someone, set them free."

46
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:18,054
{\an8}A good friend and yoga pupil, Sting,
no last initial, told me that. [chuckles]

47
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,974
{\an8}[Jason] I can't wait to show you guys
all the cool sights in Jacksonville.

48
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,185
{\an8}Like, that swamp is where me,
Pillboi and Donkey Doug

49
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,147
{\an8}used to stand and try and blind pilots
with laser pointers.

50
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,066
{\an8}Yeah, maybe we should do
the tour after we,

51
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,527
{\an8}you know, save your father's soul.

52
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,905
{\an8}Oh, I've been meaning to ask:
why are you trying to save your father?

53
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,200
{\an8}I've heard you mention
your friend Pillboi many times,

54
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,577
{\an8}but you've not mentioned your father once.

55
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,122
{\an8}What do you mean?
I talk about Donkey Doug all the time.

56
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:52,547
{\an8}I'm sorry, the man you call "Donkey Doug"
is your father?

57
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,715
{\an8}Yeah!

58
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,511
{\an8}The Donkey Doug with whom you tried to
blind airline pilots with laser pointers?

59
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,470
{\an8}Yeah!

60
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:03,975
{\an8}The Donkey Doug who's banned from
Disney World for biting Buzz Lightyear?

61
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,394
In his defense,
he thought it was someone else.

62
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,147
Who?

63
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,567
So, Michael and I have a plan
to save my dad.

64
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,778
My whole life, Donkey Doug
was always getting in trouble

65
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,489
because of some get-rich-quick scheme.

66
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,116
He sold counterfeit Truck Nutz.

67
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,745
He created a sport that was a cross
between dodgeball and horseshoes

68
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,330
and everybody died.

69
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,081
-He glued--
-This should be easy.

70
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,708
We have plenty of money.

71
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:33,212
If we just give him money, he'll blow it.
He's gotta feel like he did it himself.

72
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,840
A few years ago,
Donkey Doug was very close

73
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,842
to getting his electrician's license.

74
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,471
So, if we get him to finish the training,
he can earn an honest living

75
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,224
and be on his way to getting more
Good Place points,

76
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,476
which is why we're all here.

77
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,270
Okay, let's go save my dad.

78
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,105
-Taxi!
-[porter blows whistle]

79
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,945
[laughs]

80
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,405
-[porter] Do you need help with your bags?
-[Jason] No, I got it.

81
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,075
[knock on door]

82
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,162
-Oh, dip, Jason!
-Ah, dip, Donkey Doug!

83
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,957
You call him "Donkey Doug" in person?

84
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,458
Me and Jason are cool like that.

85
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,462
I don't think of him as my son.
I think of him as my boy!

86
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,006
I mean, I am your boy.

87
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,385
Yeah, but it's more like,
"That's my son right there, son."

88
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:25,223
But not, like "son-son,"
but like "my boy." But not, like--

89
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,308
Yes, yes, we get it. Thank you.

90
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,977
Oh, this is my friend, Michael.

91
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,063
Oh, crap, you look like a cop.
Are you a cop?

92
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,315
Because if you are, you have to tell me,

93
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,441
and you're not allowed to arrest me

94
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,652
for anything you saw
before I knew you were a cop.

95
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,030
-I'm not a police officer.
-Yeah. Michael's cool.

96
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,492
And this is Tahani,
who is my wife, I guess.

97
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,327
Dang, nice pull, son!

98
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,579
How about you and me
go check out my Jacuzzi

99
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,956
and put stuff in each other?

100
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,375
Again, I'm his wife.

101
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,878
Wow. That's the first time
that line has ever failed.

102
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,506
You must really love him.

103
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,092
Welcome to the family!
Come on in!

104
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,804
This program knows everything about
your personality, Simone's personality

105
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,514
and all human relationships.

106
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,850
It can't tell you
exactly what will happen,

107
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,936
but it will approximate Simone's reaction
to anything you say to her.

108
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,397
Plus, it has <i>Tetris! </i>[laughs]

109
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,776
Hmm. Would this work with, say, me,
and, say, Jason Statham,

110
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,863
and, uh, instead of a cafe, it was, say,

111
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,741
a room with a futon
and a bunch of Red Bull?

112
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,993
Why is it that every time
a new thing is invented,

113
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,662
humans immediately try to use it for porn?

114
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,664
-Because we're disgusting.
-Huh.

115
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,167
Eleanor and I will be watching
on the monitor. We'll see what you see.

116
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,169
Put these in your ears.
They'll play a tone

117
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,337
that will trick your brain
into seeing what I've programmed.

118
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,257
[shrill tone over earphones]

119
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,550
[screams]

120
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,472
Wow. Uh, so, this is... I'm here.

121
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,473
Hey, babe!

122
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,683
What do you want to talk about?

123
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,101
[Janet] <i>Go ahead, Chidi.</i>

124
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,103
<i>-Practice what you want to say to her.</i>
-Right. Um...

125
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,399
Simone, this has been the best year
of my life, because of you.

126
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,903
Unfortunately,
I have come to learn some information,

127
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:06,074
and it means that we have to end
this relationship.

128
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,744
-What information?
-I... can't say.

129
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,122
-Why not?
-Uh, I... I... can't say.

130
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,832
Well, you've either gone crazy

131
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,876
or you're too much of a coward
to tell me how you feel. Which is it?

132
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,878
I... I... can't, because of...

133
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,798
-[sighs] Janet!
-Who's Janet?

134
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,050
Why are you screaming her name
into the sky?

135
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,635
You know what? Whatever.
Goodbye, Chidi.

136
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,803
[Chidi] No, no, wait...

137
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:33,559
-[groans] So, that didn't go great.
-I disagree. I thought it was hilarious.

138
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,728
[Michael] So, Donkey Doug,

139
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,564
Jason told us
about your electrician license,

140
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,733
and we have a career opportunity for you.

141
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:45,488
[laughs] Yo, later for that.
I got a business proposition for you.

142
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,198
Pillboi!

143
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,202
-Oh, dip, Jason.
-Oh, dip, Pillboi.

144
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,663
-Oh, dip, Pillboi.
-Oh, dip, Donkey Doug.

145
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,706
-[Donkey Doug] Oh, dip, Jason.
-This is remarkable.

146
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,752
-It explains so much.
-Jason, I thought you were dead.

147
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,381
I was alive. I was in Australia.
I talked to you on the phone last week.

148
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,925
-Yeah, but I forgot.
-Oh.

149
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,887
Me and Pillboi have been cooking up
something real special.

150
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,473
And this time, it's not fake meth.

151
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,186
All right, Pillboi,
tell 'em about our new product.

152
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,941
Sharks, how much do you spend on
energy drinks and body spray in one week?

153
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,610
Three hundred dollars?
Ten hundred dollars?

154
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,906
What if I told you there was a product
that combined these two things

155
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,286
for one solution
to all of life's problems and more?

156
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:40,042
I give to you Double Trouble.
The world's first energy drink/body spray.

157
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,838
So, uh, do you spray it on yourself
or do you drink it?

158
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,006
You both it!

159
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,468
This is the one, Jason.
We're gonna be so rich!

160
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,220
I'll finally be able to pay
to have my calf implants

161
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,597
moved back up from my feet.

162
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,640
This is gonna be a lot tougher
than we thought.

163
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,894
Tell me about it.
Double Trouble sounds amazing.

164
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,438
We should bid fast.
The other sharks will want in.

165
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:07,111
So, I just have to be simple,
honest and declarative,

166
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,489
and somehow, still protect her feelings.

167
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,615
I don't know, man.

168
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,782
Maybe just tell her that you're gay.

169
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,035
-I'm not gay.
-Fine, bi.

170
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,288
-I'm not bi either.
-Why not? More guys should be bi.

171
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,041
It's 2018.
It's like, get over yourselves.

172
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:24,212
Is there any way I can try
a bunch of different things in a row

173
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,379
to see what works?

174
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,508
Bing! Sure. If you want to reset,
just snap your fingers.

175
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,052
Also, I made some modifications
to the tone,

176
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,513
-so it should make your transition easier.
-Oh.

177
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,308
[jazz music playing over earphones]

178
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,312
[Simone] Hey, babe.

179
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,856
-[jazz music continues]
-What did you want to talk about?

180
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,109
-Well, I don't love you anymore.
-What?

181
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,569
No, no, no, you don't understand.

182
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:54,617
I don't technically love you,
in the same way, because of circumstances.

183
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,037
-What?
-Hang on.

184
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,793
[sighs] I don't know how to tell you this,
but I'm dying.

185
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,795
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

186
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,048
Because we're all dying, slowly,
when you think about it.

187
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,385
We start dying the moment we're born,
so, not a lie.

188
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,100
Okay. Here it is.
I'm just going to be perfectly honest.

189
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,104
My real name is
Special Agent Rick Justice, FBI.

190
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,023
Nope! [sighs]

191
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:32,780
Simone, the last year has been
truly amazing.

192
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,865
And with that in mind...

193
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,328
-[Simone sighs]
-Will you marry me?

194
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,873
-Yes! Yes, of course I will! Oh!
-[diners applauding]

195
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,126
[Simone laughs]

196
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,920
Wait, what am I doing?
Why did I think this would work?

197
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,880
[Janet] <i>I'm gonna go ahead </i>
<i>and reboot this one myself.</i>

198
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,798
Yeah, good call.

199
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,341
So, Simone...

200
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,262
Wait, before you say anything,
I think we should break up.

201
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,014
-You do?
-Yes.

202
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,434
I love and respect you very much,
but we're heading in different directions.

203
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,978
And don't worry,
we don't have to make a big thing of it.

204
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,397
Oh, my God.
Okay. This is the one.

205
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,066
Remember everything. Right leg
crossed over left, coffee's right there.

206
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,236
Oh, one more thing. Suck it, ya doink!

207
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,655
-Sorry?
-[chuckles]

208
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,116
This is Eleanor, you idiot!

209
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,327
Janet let me mess with the simulator
to screw with you!

210
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,163
-Janet! Come on!
-Hi, Chidi, this is Janet now.

211
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,332
-Sorry, it won't happen again.
-Thank you.

212
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,042
[laughing] Psych! It's still Eleanor.

213
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,461
I can't believe you fell for that,
ya doink.

214
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,382
We need to break up, but here's a puppy!

215
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,092
Aw! Wait, what?

216
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,928
He's a puppy,
it's over between us, and he's cute!

217
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,348
Do you think I don't hear
the bad parts of these sentences?

218
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,850
His name is Martin, I need my keys back
and he's a puppy!

219
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,228
You are very bad at this.

220
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,481
Well, that's because I don't actually want
to break up with her!

221
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,399
What, do you need me
to break up with her for you,

222
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,817
like we're in middle school or something?

223
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,029
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yes, please do that for me.

224
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,280
-Please.
-Fine.

225
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,531
[jazz music playing over earphones]

226
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,160
-[Simone] Hey, Eleanor!
-Hey.

227
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,120
What did you want to talk about?

228
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,624
Well, first of all,
you and Chidi are so great together.

229
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,418
He really loves you and I can see why.

230
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,338
You're brilliant, charming,
obviously gorgeous...

231
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,464
Aw! You're sweet to say that.

232
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,050
-...and your accent is so cute!
-Your accent is so cute!

233
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:20,221
-What? I don't think I have an accent.
-"I don't think I have an accent!"

234
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,138
Stop it!

235
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,015
[both laughing]

236
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:32,108
What... is happening?

237
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,404
[Chidi] Nope! No! This is over.

238
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,156
Whoa! Man, come on!
It was just getting good.

239
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,158
[Michael] Let's remember the mission.

240
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,954
Your father needs to focus
on long-term stability.

241
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,331
Also, and perhaps this is less important,

242
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,834
-but there's an awful lot of dog hair...
-[microwave timer dings]

243
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,211
...on the furniture,
and I have not seen a dog.

244
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:57,508
Not bad, right? Double Trouble comes in
three delicious smell-flavors.

245
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,886
Raspberry-Perspirant,
Cedarwood Melon Blast

246
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,682
and 24-Hour Lemon Musk Xtreme.

247
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,725
That one is also a lube.

248
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:12,273
Look, Donkey Doug, Double Trouble is dope.
On that much, we can all agree on.

249
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:16,944
But you gotta think long-term.
You were good at electricity stuff.

250
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,656
You hooked us up with free porno channels
ever since the third grade.

251
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,660
-It's good, honest work.
-"Honest work"? Whatever, Dad.

252
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,829
You're his dad.

253
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,708
This is huge, J.
When Double Trouble pops off,

254
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,793
I'll be able to quit my job
at the old folks' home.

255
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,840
Buy a big-ass mansion.
Every day I'd wake up, get out of bed,

256
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:42,052
brush my teeth, rinse, go downstairs,
open the fridge,

257
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,180
"Damn, we outta milk," get in my car--

258
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,807
You don't have to run through
the whole imaginary day.

259
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:51,020
Jason, I believe in Double Trouble.
Why won't you believe in me?

260
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,565
[Michael mouths] Oh, boy...

261
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:59,612
Well, I suppose a little
entrepreneurial spirit never hurt anyone.

262
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,991
You know, "Reach for the stars,"
as I said to my good friend Elon Musk.

263
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,702
And then he shot his car into space.

264
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,872
What a weird creep.
Why was I friends with him?

265
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,292
Maybe this is what'll put your father
on the right path.

266
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,545
And, hey, it's not like
he's robbing a bank.

267
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,589
Yeah. It's a factory!

268
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:20,841
Excuse me?

269
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,426
Tonight, we're gonna steal
some energy drinks

270
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,011
from an energy drink factory,

271
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,888
and steal some cologne
from a cologne factory.

272
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,140
So, it's actually two factories.

273
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,476
[Donkey Doug] Then we just gotta
bottle it all up!

274
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,812
Aw, dip, we gotta rob a bottle factory.
Three factories.

275
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,064
Three factories!

276
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,233
[Jason] <i>Stupid Donkey Doug.</i>

277
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,070
I mean, two factories I can understand,
but three?

278
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:46,784
You might want to consider the possibility
that your father's a lost cause.

279
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:51,747
I have an idea, but I need your help.
Will you guys help me?

280
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,960
I mean, yeah,
that's... that's why we're here, Jason.

281
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,421
-What's your idea, darling?
-We're gonna save Pillboi.

282
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,051
[Chidi] Okay, real life.
I think I'm ready.

283
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,720
I've analyzed the ten
most successful scenarios

284
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,223
and compiled the statistically
most effective breakup strategy.

285
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,933
Who said you weren't a romantic?

286
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,268
Every girlfriend I've ever had.

287
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,562
Oh! There she is.
Okay, wish me luck.

288
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,981
[exhales]

289
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,151
Oh, hi. Uh...

290
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,236
Something wrong?

291
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,446
Uh, no. It's just that
we're usually over there.

292
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,782
Doesn't matter.

293
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,204
Okay, so I've spent a lot of time

294
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,331
thinking about everything
that's happened in the last year--

295
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,916
Hi, there. What can I get you to drink?

296
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,377
-Uh, I'll have an iced tea, please.
-Water, thanks.

297
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:43,257
Um, it's been a time of massive
personal and professional growth--

298
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,801
-Sorry, sugar with that iced tea?
-Yes, please.

299
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,804
Um, all in all,
it's been overwhelmingly positive,

300
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,390
and I think that's due in large part
to you.

301
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,810
Sorry, real quick, I'm gonna go on break,
so Helmut will be taking care of you.

302
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,688
Hello! Will you be eating with us today?

303
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,106
Just please give us one second!

304
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,441
<i>Ja,</i> okay.

305
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,444
One! That was one second. [laughs]
That was joke!

306
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,321
-Please get out of here, Helmut!
-Okay,<i> ja!</i>

307
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,740
All right, look, just, um...
we need to break up!

308
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,992
-I am breaking up with you!
-Why?

309
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,871
[stammers] I can't... It's complicated,
but it's happening.

310
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:14,872
Ya dumped!

311
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:21,211
-Okay.
-Wait, wait, no. Come back, please!

312
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,506
<i>-Ja,</i> okay, I'm back!
-Not you, Helmut!

313
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,845
Hey, now, listen, Judy.

314
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,848
You can't mix Xannies
with these lil' pink fools.

315
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,769
You'll be tripping balls like Clarence was
when he crawled into the ice machine.

316
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,397
-[laughs]
-Here, take half of one of these,

317
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,318
wash it down with a 5-Hour Energy,
and you'll be golden.

318
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,487
Body high with mild visuals.

319
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,447
[laughs] Thanks, Pillboi.

320
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,326
Yo, I gotta take off
'cause I gotta go do a robbery.

321
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,329
I mean, I'm sick.

322
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,001
Hello, Pillboi.
I'm here on behalf of Jason.

323
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,464
You won't be attending the job
with Donkey Doug today.

324
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,966
There's been a change of plans.

325
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:08,842
Okay.

326
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,014
That's it?
You don't need any more information?

327
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,725
-I mean, do you want to tell me?
-Not really.

328
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,227
Cool.

329
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,187
Want some pills?

330
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,109
[Chidi] I hate this.
What if I ruined her?

331
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,653
What if I sent her down the wrong path
and she ends up in the Bad Place?

332
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,739
I have to undo what I did.
Janet, fire up the simulator.

333
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,535
Dude, no more simulations.
Just talk to her.

334
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,246
Breakups never end
with both people feeling great.

335
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:42,376
But she's a badass, and her world
is bigger than your relationship.

336
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:47,006
She'll recover.
Just go, be a person.

337
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,926
Right. Here I go.

338
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,223
Janet, can I use the simulator?

339
00:16:56,306 --> 00:17:00,060
There's a very specific Lenny Kravitz
concert I want to be front row at.

340
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,730
Sure! FYI, when the system boots up,

341
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,691
you might find yourself in a steam room
with Jason,

342
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,068
who will be wearing an old-timey
strongman onesie.

343
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,070
It's a bug in the system.

344
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,658
[Donkey Doug] Pillboi?

345
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,705
No, it's me. Pillboi's friend Jason.
Pillboi's not coming.

346
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,833
If you're here to tell me
an energy drink body spray is a bad idea,

347
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,126
I've heard it before.

348
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,919
From a bank and some doctors.

349
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,546
I'mma help you make Double Trouble,

350
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,174
but you gotta leave Pillboi alone
from now on.

351
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,051
I'm trying to save him.

352
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:36,597
Oh, dip. You got religious and shizz?
Amen.

353
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,223
Amen.

354
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,350
Okay, hurry up
and get this crap in my truck.

355
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,894
[police siren wails]

356
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,980
[police officer] Jacksonville Police.
Come out with your hands up!

357
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,650
Are you a cop?
Because if you are, you have to tell us!

358
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,278
[police officer] Yes. This is the police.

359
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,821
[Donkey Doug] Yup, I knew it.
It's the cops.

360
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,324
What do we do?
Yo, let's get out of here.

361
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,408
No.

362
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,661
I know I haven't been
the best father in the world.

363
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,456
I might not have even been
in the top five.

364
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,127
I want to make up for that.
I'll distract them, you run out the back.

365
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,128
No, that's crazy.

366
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,714
It's what my dad did for me.
And his dad, for him.

367
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,426
And some day,
you'll do this exact thing for your son.

368
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,264
I mean, I hope not.
But thanks, Donkey Doug.

369
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,349
Hey...

370
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:25,479
-Call me "Donkey Dad."
-Okay, Donkey Dad.

371
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,607
Nah, that sounds wack.
Call me Donkey Doug.

372
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,359
Cool.

373
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,949
[Donkey Doug] Bortles!

374
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,874
Uh...

375
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:53,715
[sighs] Here's the truth. You're amazing.
And my feelings have changed.

376
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,928
I wish I could tell you why.
I really, really do.

377
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,266
But... I can't.

378
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,560
Well,

379
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,481
you seem to know what you want,
which is rare for you.

380
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,860
[stammers] I hope
you keep the study going.

381
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,821
It might help a lot of people.

382
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:20,826
[sighs] Well, see you in the next life.

383
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,786
Why would you say that?
What do you know?

384
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,164
It's a figure of speech.

385
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:29,585
You're so weird, man.
I think maybe this is for the best.

386
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,757
So, your covert mission
is to continue to report to this job

387
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,051
until you receive our signal.

388
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,137
Now, this is the most important thing...

389
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,849
you cannot commit any more crimes,

390
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,645
and you must help these people
as much as you can.

391
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,857
-The mission depends on it.
-[Pillboi] Roger that.

392
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,320
Man, I can't believe this whole time
you guys were with NASA.

393
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:02,534
Yes, we are secret astronaut spies.
That is indeed what Jason told you.

394
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:07,497
Take good care of these old fools
and stay out of trouble.

395
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,292
I love you, bro. [sniffles]

396
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,211
I love you, bro.

397
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,800
[both sobbing]

398
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,472
-Psych!
-I got you, bro.

399
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,806
I got you, bro.

400
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,891
-Jag...
-...uars...

401
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:26,892
-...rule.
-...rule.

402
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,811
[both continue crying]

403
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,694
{\an8}Well, my sister's museum exhibit
opens tomorrow.

404
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,198
{\an8}Are you all ready for some Al-Jamil
family reconciliation?

405
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,742
{\an8}You know it, wifey!
Soul Squad is on a roll.

406
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,452
{\an8}I pretty much nailed that Pillboi thing.

407
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,996
{\an8}And I got closure with my dad,
Donkey Doug.

408
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,416
{\an8}That remains depressing.
But I'm happy for you, bud.

409
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,293
{\an8}I never got to do that with my parents,

410
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,712
{\an8}and now they're both dead,
so it's impossible.

411
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,175
{\an8}So, the thing is, one of your parents

412
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,971
{\an8}is not technically actually dead.

413
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,014
{\an8}What are you talking about?

414
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,893
{\an8}Your mother's alive.
She faked her own death.

415
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,521
I'm sorry, Tahani.

416
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,023
I don't think I'll be able to stay
with you here in Budapest.

417
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,820
Turns out my mom isn't dead,
so I need to fly back to America

418
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,029
to murder her.
