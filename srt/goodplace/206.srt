1
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,435
-Hello!
-[exclaims]

2
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,520
Sorry.

3
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:25,024
To activate your Janet,
press nose for three seconds.

4
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,360
Okay, okay. Um...

5
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,030
Can you walk yet? Here.

6
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,324
Oh.

7
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,827
-Hello, I'm Janet.
-[shushes]

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,163
-Hello--
-[shushes]

9
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:41,082
-Hello, I'm Janet.
-I really need you to shut up.

10
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,135
Where did you get this?

11
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,970
Did you actually get into
the Good Place somehow?

12
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,891
Didn't need to. They keep their Janets
in a neutral pocket dimension

13
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,434
beneath the shapeless time void.

14
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,519
It's right next to accounting.

15
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,065
And you just walked in and stole her?
It was that easy?

16
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,442
You didn't have to choke out an angel
or anything?

17
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,444
Doors were unlocked, no security.

18
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:13,740
It makes sense, right? They're good,
so they're stupid and trusting.

19
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,367
I understand you need the four humans
to think they're in the Good Place,

20
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,537
but using an actual Good Place Janet
seems risky.

21
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,123
Why don't you have a Bad Place Janet
pretend to be good?

22
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,043
I thought of that, but watch...
Bad Janet?

23
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,753
What up, skidmarks?

24
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:31,466
Let's try that thing again where you
pretend to be a Good Janet, okay?

25
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,010
-Now, really try your best.
-Fine.

26
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:38,306
Say, Janet, where can I get
some delicious ice cream?

27
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,935
There's a wonderful parlor
in the middle of town square.

28
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,604
My favorite flavor is Rocky Road.

29
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:48,525
It contains chocolate ribbon, marshmallows

30
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:54,572
and your dad's salty nuts, you fat dink!

31
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,746
I see what you mean.
Use the good one.

32
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:09,087
Janet, you and I are about to have
a real adventure together.

33
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,966
Wait a second.
What are you telling me?

34
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,760
Are you saying
because you're glitching out--

35
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,804
The neighborhood is in danger
of total collapse.

36
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:23,309
Fun fact, mathematically, it's equally
likely to either im- or explode. [laughs]

37
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:28,022
Okay, okay, so I suppose
the next question should be...

38
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,733
-what's causing the problem?
-Unclear.

39
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,778
The glitches started out small
and then began to escalate.

40
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,405
Then I came here, looking for help.

41
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:39,075
Then I started talking and then
you looked at me, annoyed, like that.

42
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,827
And now, here we are.

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,745
Okay, all right.

44
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,956
Yeah, this is very bad.

45
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,084
-Let's run a full diagnostic, Janet.
-You got it.

46
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,130
Little short on time here.

47
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,173
It's a little hard to get out.

48
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,843
Almost got it.

49
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,637
Here it is.

50
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,806
My user manual.

51
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,601
Okay, let's get started.

52
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,686
[theme music playing]

53
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,776
[Michael] "Hello and welcome
to your new Janet.

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,947
Janets are brought to you by the makers
of light, darkness and everything."

55
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,908
I need to skip ahead here.

56
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,993
{\an8}Where's the troubleshooting part?

57
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,412
{\an8}-Michael? What's with the earthquake?
-Hmm?

58
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,332
{\an8}Janet's experiencing
a slight technical issue.

59
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,043
{\an8}-Ew! What's wrong with it?
-Oh! Um, uh...

60
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,837
{\an8}I tried to eat some frozen yogurt.
It looked so good!

61
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,882
{\an8}But I'm not supposed to eat anything,
so there was a little earthquake.

62
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,717
[rumbling]

63
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,303
See? There it is again.

64
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,138
Can't you just reset these things?

65
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,766
What do you do again?
It's the ears, yeah?

66
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,143
{\an8}It's down, down, out...

67
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,771
{\an8}Can I speak to you for a second, outside?

68
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:53,149
{\an8}This is a common problem
and I've got it under control.

69
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,985
{\an8}I don't know.
First, you went rogue at the party,

70
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,529
{\an8}with your sports car
and your weird earring.

71
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,365
{\an8}Now Janet's breaking down?

72
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:06,496
{\an8}It's like you're begging me
to tell Shawn you're incompetent. Begging!

73
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,123
{\an8}Vicky, it's a temporary problem,
I promise.

74
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,752
{\an8}Hey, you know who could
use some torturing right now? Chidi.

75
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,005
{\an8}-[gasps] Oh! I love torturing Chidi.
-I know.

76
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,549
{\an8}I had this great idea the other night.

77
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,551
{\an8}Thought it was worth exploring.
Picture this:

78
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,304
{\an8}Needles.

79
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,474
{\an8}-Oh! That's the whole idea.
-Yeah!

80
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,476
{\an8}-Needles! [laughs]
-Yeah! Genius, right?

81
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,436
{\an8}-Yeah!
-I mean, needles!

82
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,522
{\an8}-Wonderful, wonderful. So smart!
-[laughing]

83
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,774
-Yeah.
-Needles. Yeah, run with that.

84
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,528
Okay, hopefully bought us a little time.

85
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,407
Where were we?
Here we go. Yeah, glitches.

86
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,660
"In the event of malfunction,
run the following tests.

87
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:49,414
First test, basic corporeal function."
Hop up on the table.

88
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,167
[vocalizing]

89
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,673
All right, great.

90
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,511
99.7 trillion degrees.

91
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,638
Little bit on the high side,
but no biggie.

92
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,058
And still no blood.

93
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,769
Oh, thank goodness.
Okay, what's next?

94
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,981
"Summoning and retrieval.
Have Janet produce an object

95
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,693
using the random object generator
program." Okay.

96
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:28,036
A 14-ounce ostrich steak impaled
on a giant novelty pencil that says,

97
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,539
-"Lordy, Lordy, I'm over 40."
-Here you go.

98
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,709
"Lordy, Lordy, I'm over 40." Perfect.

99
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,172
Okay. "Third test, informational accuracy.

100
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,340
Glitches may be a sign that..."

101
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,719
You didn't finish your sentence.

102
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:51,309
"Glitches may be a sign that your Janet is
processing or disseminating information

103
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:55,354
that is incompatible
with objective truth."

104
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,232
They're talking about lying, Janet.

105
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,071
This is all my fault.

106
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,950
I told you a lie that first day we met.

107
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,207
Okay, here goes nothing.

108
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,716
Hello, I'm Janet
and I have now been fully activated.

109
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,221
Hello, Janet. I'm Michael,
a Good Place architect.

110
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,016
One of the best. Top-notch.
You're in luck, here.

111
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,726
Happy to meet you, Michael.

112
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,978
I will help you make
the perfect neighborhood.

113
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,438
Would you like to get started?

114
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,440
One small note there, Janet.

115
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,943
The neighborhood that I want to build

116
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:46,906
might be a little different from the ones
that you might be familiar with.

117
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,826
-Is that all right?
-Of course, silly billy!

118
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,369
I build and operate the neighborhood,

119
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,956
but every aspect of the design
is entirely up to you!

120
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,085
For example, if you'd like me to stop
calling you silly billy, just say so!

121
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,754
Yeah, I don't like that at all.
Michael's fine.

122
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,131
Sounds good, Michael.

123
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,844
I lied to you.

124
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:14,183
I lied about who I was
and what we were doing,

125
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,312
and then I lied a billion more times
to support that first lie.

126
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,315
And now you're all discombobulated.

127
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,777
-It's my fault.
-Nope. You're wrong.

128
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,613
If the glitching was only a result
of you lying to me,

129
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,532
why wouldn't I have been
glitching all along?

130
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,242
Why would it only be starting now?

131
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,744
Wow. That's a good point.

132
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,204
-I know, right?
-[knocking on door]

133
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,248
-May--
-Excuse us, Michael,

134
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,500
but we've been trying to call Janet,
and she isn't answering.

135
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,085
Hi, guys. I'm broken.

136
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,422
Yeah. I had to take her offline
for a system check.

137
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,756
She'll be available real soon.

138
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,842
Cool, because I'm just
so freakin' excited,

139
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,344
because Tahani said
she's never had jalapeño poppers.

140
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,180
I wanted to get some for her.

141
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,556
[Tahani] They sound so disgusting.

142
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,268
But if Jason likes them,
then maybe I will, too,

143
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,897
because we are together.
I can finally admit that.

144
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,107
[Jason] Babe, you admitted it!

145
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,650
That's sweet.

146
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,777
Whoa! You two are sleeping together?

147
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,488
Only when we're done having sex.

148
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,240
Anyways, Janet, can you help us?

149
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,159
As soon as Michael puts me back online,

150
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:17,079
I'd be more than happy to help you
get that extra-special gift for Tahani.

151
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,375
Whoa.

152
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,002
What's happening?

153
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,339
-Oh, boy.
-What the...

154
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,968
Oh, man. We got robbed!

155
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,930
They took the walls, the floor
and we were standing here the whole time?

156
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,098
These guys are good.

157
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,144
[Tahani] Michael, what do we do?

158
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,900
Okay, there we go.
Nothing to worry about.

159
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,195
Happens sometimes.
Perfectly normal. Let's go.

160
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,780
Is Janet going to be all right?

161
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,783
Totally fine. Please go back
to your house and wait for her there.

162
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,410
She'll show up shortly
with lots of jalapeño poppers.

163
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,495
-And cheesy fries?
-Mmm-hmm.

164
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,247
-With donkey sauce? And the cool hat?
-Sure.

165
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,416
-[Michael] Ding-dong.
-I don't seem to be getting better.

166
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:07,672
That glitch appears to have been limited
to this building, so Vicky won't know.

167
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,590
That's the good news. The bad news is,

168
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,593
I seem to be losing my ability
to sustain object permanence.

169
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,262
It's a glass half-full,

170
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,556
glass stops-existing-in-time-and-space
kinda deal.

171
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,392
Okay, let's walk through
what just happened.

172
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,352
Jason and Tahani came in,

173
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,689
revealed the crazy fact
that they're in a relationship.

174
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,234
I already knew that
and I am so happy for them.

175
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,860
[retching]

176
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,873
Janet, tell me a lie.

177
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,000
Janets can't lie.

178
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,962
-You lied to Vicky earlier.
-Interesting. I guess I did.

179
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,508
I suppose after 802 reboots,
I must have gained the ability to lie.

180
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,927
That's fun. I want to try to lie again.

181
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,013
I love your outfit.

182
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,486
"Incompatible with objective truth."

183
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,450
The problem isn't me lying to you,
but you lying to other people.

184
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,493
Like when you said to Jason,

185
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,122
"I'd be happy to help you and Tahani."
That was a lie.

186
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,459
No, it wasn't. I'm always happy to
help people. That's my main purpose.

187
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,087
It was still a lie,
even though you didn't intend it to be,

188
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,298
because you weren't actually
happy to help them.

189
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,176
Because you're in love with Jason.

190
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,470
Say what now?

191
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,097
After the very first time
you were rebooted,

192
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,184
and as you were slowly
regaining your knowledge,

193
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,561
you bonded with Jason.

194
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,647
The two of you got married,

195
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,193
and I think somehow, you're still,
deep down, in love with him.

196
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,904
[scoffs] No. That is impossible.

197
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,949
Think logically.
When was the first glitch?

198
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,786
When I said I was happy to give
Jason and Tahani couples' therapy.

199
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,412
And the second glitch?

200
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,247
When I said I was happy
to see them embracing.

201
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,124
And the third glitch, the earthquake?

202
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,378
When I said I was happy
I'd helped improve their relationship.

203
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,631
Oh... Nuts.

204
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,841
-Yeah.
-But I am happy for them.

205
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,636
I am. I am. Am I? I am.

206
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:22,681
I am not. I am not! I am not that.
I am not happy for them. [gasps]

207
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:27,478
How is this possible? I don't have
any memory of being married to Jason.

208
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:31,690
You said Janets get more
sophisticated every time they're rebooted.

209
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,735
Well, maybe you falling in love with Jason

210
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:39,365
was some sort of mutation
that then was amplified with each reboot.

211
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,909
Okay, that makes total sense.

212
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,412
I know what you have to do now. Kill me!

213
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,957
Sorry, I say everything in
a cheery manner, but in this case,

214
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,500
it may be inappropriate. I'll try again.

215
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,709
[clears throat]

216
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,045
You have to kill me, Michael.

217
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,257
-Better?
-Janet, I can't reboot you.

218
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,926
That will intensify your feelings
for Jason

219
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,178
and that's what got us into this mess
in the first place.

220
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,808
I'm not saying reboot me.
I'm saying set me to self-destruct.

221
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,564
"In the event of continued malfunction,

222
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,442
hold down Janet's nose
and insert paper clip

223
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,236
-into small hole behind left ear."
-Right here.

224
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,780
"Janet will rapidly collapse
in on herself.

225
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,199
When Janet is roughly the size
of a marble,

226
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:26,078
she can be launched into space
through an inter-dimensional suction tube,

227
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,664
or eaten as a mid-day snack."

228
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:32,042
I'm very high in potassium, like a banana!

229
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,503
"A new Janet will need to be procured

230
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,132
in order to return the neighborhood
to functionality."

231
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:42,386
Easy. I'll be gone, you'll get a new Janet
and everything will go back to normal.

232
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,222
Not for me. I'll be a lifeless marble
floating through space.

233
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,183
But you'll be back to normal!

234
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,273
Are you sure this is what you want?
To self-destruct?

235
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,318
What I really want is to stay
and serve the neighborhood,

236
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,738
but due to my feelings for Jason,
I'm putting everyone at risk.

237
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:05,075
So, looks like it's <i>adiós, </i>Janito.

238
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,328
Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt.

239
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,539
You didn't give me a heads-up
about this new Vicky torture.

240
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,126
The one with the needles in my face.

241
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,670
-Little busy here, bud.
-[Chidi] Yeah, totally.

242
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,756
I don't wanna be a nudge,

243
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,719
but is there anything else coming down
the pike you forgot to mention?

244
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,262
I honestly don't know,

245
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:29,683
but I have bigger fish to fry,
so just walk it off.

246
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:34,188
I would love to walk it off,
but my feet have needles in them!

247
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,941
-I don't know what to tell ya.
-Okay, but...

248
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,859
Okay, self-destruct time.

249
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,820
Marbleize me, Michael.

250
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,782
It's the only choice.
I won't feel any pain or anything.

251
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,911
[chanting] Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.

252
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:53,082
I really don't wanna do this, Janet,
but I suppose it makes sense.

253
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,167
Great! Grab a paper clip.

254
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,098
Okay, that was the last pudding shop.

255
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,308
Great, should I begin
to welcome the residents?

256
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,603
No, wait, wait, wait.
This is all wrong!

257
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,481
Pudding restaurant! What even is that?

258
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,734
-Pudding won't work.
-It's okay, Michael. Just relax.

259
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,069
I can't, Janet!

260
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,030
My design has to be perfect, for me to...

261
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,286
In order to accomplish
what I need to accomplish.

262
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:37,042
I'm way out on a limb here.
And I'm all alone.

263
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:41,005
No, you're not. You have me, Janet.
I can help you.

264
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,925
It's too hard to explain, but there are
certain aspects of my plan

265
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,094
that you just can't understand.

266
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,847
-Try me.
-[scoffs] Yeah.

267
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,893
All right, fine, fine.

268
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,646
Janet, what's a food
that people think they enjoy,

269
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,523
but that's also kind of a bummer?

270
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,610
-Frozen yogurt.
-[whoops] Yes!

271
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,822
Frozen yogurt. Janet, you're a genius.

272
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,743
-Correct. But why do you want a food--
-Don't worry about that. [laughs]

273
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,705
Okay, let's make all these restaurants
frozen yogurt.

274
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,833
-Okey dokey.
-[laughing]

275
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,836
-Would you like to try it?
-Yeah.

276
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,467
It's just okay.

277
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,929
Which means it's perfect.

278
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,764
Let's bring in the residents.

279
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,141
I don't know what just happened,
but I'm happy you're happy!

280
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,646
Michael?

281
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,317
Hmm? Sorry. Yeah, yes, sorry.

282
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,489
Oh...

283
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,075
-I can't do it.
-Come on, dude.

284
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,703
It's dangerous, is what it is.
Vicky could find out!

285
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,830
Then the plan, the whole plan...

286
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,125
It's bad for the plan, Janet.
That's the reason.

287
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,460
I don't understand.

288
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,630
Given the situation, it's far safer
to initiate the self-destruct.

289
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,382
Mmm-hmm.

290
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,469
Okay, look, see, here...

291
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,555
Here's the reason.
I promised the four humans

292
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,266
that we would escape to
the Good Place once and for all,

293
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,104
and without you, we stand zero chance
of ever making it there.

294
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,730
The new Janet will be able
to help you with that.

295
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,273
But it's not only that, though.

296
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:27,736
See, it's also because of...
What if Vicky found out?

297
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,279
You already asked me that.

298
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,949
Why are you making such a big deal
about turning me into a marble forever?

299
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,910
Because of reasons. There are reasons!

300
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,122
They exist and I don't want
to explain them right now!

301
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,624
-What are the reasons?
-There are reasons!

302
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,627
-But what are they?
-The reason is friends!

303
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:54,221
You're my friend, Janet.
That's why I can't kill you.

304
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,016
We have been through so much together.

305
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,227
I mean, yeah, sure, for you,
each time I rebooted you,

306
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,104
you met me all over again.

307
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:06,650
But for me, our relationship
has become important.

308
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:13,282
You're my oldest, my truest,
my most loyal friend.

309
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,409
I can't just get rid of you

310
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:19,663
and replace you with some other Janet
I don't even know.

311
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,341
Well, well, well...

312
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,093
Don't do that. Just lay off.

313
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,553
Michael!

314
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,725
That was so nice of you.
I'm glad you said that.

315
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,519
Well, I mean it.

316
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,440
Look at us, a couple of old pals,

317
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:50,402
trying to make our way
in this crazy world that I built.

318
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,279
Two peas in a pod.

319
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,699
One of whom needs to kill
the other one immediately.

320
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,871
Michael, come on. Kill me!

321
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,501
No, there has to be another way.

322
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,545
This problem you're facing,
it's about emotion, right?

323
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,130
That's a human problem.

324
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,093
So maybe we should consult
our most problematic human.

325
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,013
So, let me get this straight.

326
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,641
You want me to convince Michael
to turn you into a marble

327
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,893
because you're causing earthquakes,

328
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,438
because you're sad about Jason,
to whom you were once married,

329
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,107
because he's currently
sleeping with Tahani?

330
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,483
-Correct.
-I don't think I've ever

331
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,277
meant this literally,
but that might be too much information.

332
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,697
First of all,
I totally get the Jason thing.

333
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,785
He's a ding-dong,
but also a straight hottie, so up top.

334
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,788
But more important,
what you're going through

335
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,040
is something every person
has gone through.

336
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:45,999
Not a person.

337
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,544
Actually, right now, you kind of are,

338
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,421
because you just found out
your ex is dating someone else.

339
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:56,176
And yeah, it sucks, but trust me,
it's not worth all this drama.

340
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,679
You need to get drunk and go dancing.

341
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,306
You'll forget all about Jason.
Can you get drunk?

342
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,726
Not really. Although, if I stand next to
a powerful array of magnets,

343
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,145
I do get pretty loopy.

344
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:10,524
Do that. Pop a couple magnets,
listen to some No Doubt, dye your hair.

345
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,360
You'll be totally fine in two seconds.

346
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,905
Honestly, the best move
is to get another dude

347
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,199
and just go to town. Rebound guy!

348
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,703
But I guess here, your options
are pretty limited. What about Michael?

349
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,497
-Extraordinarily bad idea.
-Right. Forget it.

350
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,041
But you don't need to worry.

351
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,209
You're awesome.

352
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,545
You contain all the knowledge
in the universe,

353
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,299
you have a rippin' bod
and you can literally do anything!

354
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,176
This is just a blip.

355
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,637
So, was it helpful?

356
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,641
Yes, Eleanor told me instead of being sad,
I should, "Go get it, girl!"

357
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,310
So, I'm going to go get it, girl!

358
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,477
-Get what?
-Unclear.

359
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,729
I'll get everything, to be safe.

360
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,898
I should be able to avoid glitches

361
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,192
by watching what I say
around Jason and Tahani.

362
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,277
[sighs] Thank you for your help.

363
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,280
-I'm so glad we're friends.
-Me, too.

364
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,033
Since we're friends,
I can tell you this honestly.

365
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,702
Take that outfit out of rotation.
It makes you look bottom-heavy.

366
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,538
It does, doesn't it? [groans]

367
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,625
If it's okay with you, I'm gonna go
to my void for a little while.

368
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,711
I need to spend some time alone
and focus on myself.

369
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,421
Take all the time you need.

370
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,715
[chuckles]

371
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,467
-Hi, there.
-Hello!

372
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,971
-Janet, who's that man?
-This is my new rebound boyfriend, Derek.

373
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,433
-I made him.
-[chuckles] Hi, I'm Derek.

374
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,601
You must be--

375
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,396
Oh... Okay, that makes more sense.

376
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,689
You must be Michael.

377
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,983
Janet's made a lot of talk-talk
into my earholes about you.

378
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,861
Michael, Michael, Klichael, Klichael.

379
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,030
Janet, you can't make a person.

380
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,740
I know. But I did, though.

381
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,494
Eleanor said that to forget about Jason,
I should create a rebound guy.

382
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,037
So, I made one. Derek!

383
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,373
-I'm her boyfriend and she made me.
-He's so nice.

384
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:53,210
[laughs] Whoa! Look at this glass.
Oh, my God.

385
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,047
I'm in there, too?
What's going on right now?

386
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,008
{\an8}It's my first time making someone,
so he might be a bit off.

387
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,261
{\an8}This could be...
Please put that down.

388
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,889
{\an8}This could be very dangerous!
It shouldn't even be possible.

389
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,184
{\an8}Maybe not 800 reboots ago.
But apparently, now it is.

390
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,436
{\an8}[laughing]

391
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,230
{\an8}Can you believe this?

392
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,482
{\an8}-Derek, is it Derek?
-It's Derek.

393
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,402
{\an8}Derek, could you please give me and Janet
a moment alone?

394
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,070
{\an8}Go back to the void.
I'll be there in a minute.

395
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,989
{\an8}-Okay, I'll miss you like crazy.
-I'll miss you more.

396
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,783
{\an8}No, I'll miss you more. Bye!

397
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,286
[chuckling] What a dork, am I right?
