1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:07,382
So you're telling me I can't get
any pancakes at this IHOP?

2
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,842
It's not the place you're thinking of.

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,720
This is the
Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes.

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,805
It's the crossroads of all dimensions,

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,142
like Grand Central Station,
but for space and time.

6
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:20,145
If you eat anything in this IHOP,
you will literally explode.

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,230
Yeah, I know. It's IHOP.

8
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,316
Why are we meeting there?

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,527
The Judge's powers
are limited in the IHOP,

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,779
so she can't just retire me on the spot.

11
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,364
And I believe that when she hears

12
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,366
what I've discovered
about the points system,

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,492
she'll take our side.

14
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,746
If not, then we'll jump through a portal
to another dimension,

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,041
hope our molecules don't liquefy,
and regroup from there.

16
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,376
Excuse me. Okay.

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,337
Now, watch your step.

18
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:51,468
Hey, so, yeah.
So, I don't wanna go in there.

19
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,262
I get that. Come here.
Here are your options:

20
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,473
Option number one...

21
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,515
[Chidi screams]

22
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,019
Cruel, but necessary.

23
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,398
[Chidi screams]

24
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,402
[Michael] Oh. Look at this.

25
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,529
-They added a tenth dimension.
-[Janet gasps]

26
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,240
-[all exclaim]
-[Michael chuckles]

27
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,825
Boy, permits must've been a headache.

28
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,954
[Tahani] Looks like we're inside
a Diane Von Furstenberg pattern...

29
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,291
from spring 2013!

30
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:27,504
Okay, everyone, just be cool,
I know exactly what's going on.

31
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,423
We all smoked too much salvia.

32
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,384
We gotta ride this out
for about two, three minutes,

33
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:37,931
and then we'll be back in Pillboi's
broken hot tub and this will all be over.

34
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,016
[theme music playing]

35
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,398
{\an8}Hey, is this a good time to talk?

36
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,567
{\an8}Well, there's no time like the present.

37
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:53,196
{\an8}And here, there's neither "no time"
nor "the present." [chuckles]

38
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,115
{\an8}Go ahead.

39
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,034
{\an8}So, you know how me and you
used to be married,

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,327
{\an8}when I was dead before?

41
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,954
{\an8}Mmm-hmm.

42
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,372
{\an8}I think I'm starting to catch

43
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,624
{\an8}-feelings again for you.
-Mmm-hmm.

44
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,502
{\an8}And if I don't double-die in this IHOP,

45
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:11,047
{\an8}and the Judge lady
doesn't turn you into a marble,

46
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,300
{\an8}do you want to try being
boyfriend-girlfriend?

47
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,927
{\an8}I'm not a girl.

48
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,098
{\an8}But, yes, I'd very much like to go on
a date with you, somewhere, sometime.

49
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,268
{\an8}As opposed to here, which is nowhere,
at all the times.

50
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,894
[both laugh]

51
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,437
-Do you get it?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,065
-[energy pulsates]
-[Judge] Hey! Butthead!

53
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:34,028
You lie to my face, disrespect my orders,

54
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,281
steal the only key to Earth,

55
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,617
meddle with an already
compromised timeline,

56
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,454
kidnap the humans into a Janet's void,

57
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,625
and now demand a meeting
in the freakin' IHOP?

58
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,127
I hate this place.

59
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,088
{\an8}I wouldn't have asked for a meet
if it weren't vitally important.

60
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,090
{\an8}And I promise, no more rule breaking.

61
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,967
{\an8}Oh, yeah? Really? Cool.

62
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,346
{\an8}'Cause it kinda looks like
you stole a book from Accounting!

63
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,601
{\an8}No more rule breaking... starting now.

64
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,185
{\an8}[Chidi groans]

65
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,981
{\an8}Hello, Chidi!
That is a great look for you.

66
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:13,026
Things don't work out here
with li'l blondie, you know who to call.

67
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,569
This bitch.

68
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:18,072
-Sorry, what is on me right now?
-[creature squeaking]

69
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,824
Oops. Where'd you come from, little buddy?

70
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,367
[Michael] No, don't touch it!

71
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,620
Tahani, do not touch the Neednoggle.

72
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:28,249
-What?
-Bad. This is all bad.

73
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,084
Humans are such whiners.

74
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,295
Here, hot pants.
Let me take care of it for you.

75
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,005
[Tahani] Help!

76
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,217
-[Tahani gasps]
-[Michael] Ah!

77
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,637
Everybody, you're all still standing
in the IHOP.

78
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,223
The Judge simply augmented your reality

79
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,893
to make you feel like
you're in a normal IHOP. Very smart.

80
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,062
Don't suck up to me, you suck-up.

81
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,605
[Tahani] This is far better.

82
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,650
Instead of a slug creature,
I have a cute little scarf.

83
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,235
-No, no, no! Don't touch it.
-[yelps] No!

84
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,281
Tahani, that's still the Neednoggle.
The Judge just made it look like a scarf.

85
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,659
-Wonderful.
-[Michael] All right.

86
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,077
Why don't we all sit down,

87
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,704
so I can fill the Judge in
on what we've learned?

88
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,666
Your Honor, I once stood in front of you

89
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,210
and said I thought there was something
wrong with the points system.

90
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,379
I finally know what it is.

91
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,548
Life now is so complicated,

92
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,928
it's impossible for anyone
to be good enough for the Good Place.

93
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:26,349
I know you don't like to learn too much
about life on Earth to remain impartial,

94
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,311
but these days,
just buying a tomato at a grocery store

95
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,691
means that you are unwittingly
supporting toxic pesticides,

96
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,860
exploiting labor,
contributing to global warming.

97
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,321
Humans think that
they're making one choice,

98
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,699
but they're actually making
dozens of choices

99
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,242
they don't even know they're making.

100
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,955
Your big revelation is
"Life is complicated"?

101
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,209
That's not a revelation.
That's a divorced woman's throw pillow.

102
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,630
I mean, this guy chose this tomato.
Those are the consequences.

103
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,299
You don't want the consequences?

104
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:03,094
Do the research, buy another tomato.
What else you got?

105
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,766
Uh, I'll tell you what else I got.
I got, uh... I got this.

106
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,479
[Eleanor] Michael?

107
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,273
What are you doing?

108
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,317
-The Backpack Kid dance!
-Why?

109
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,820
I don't know, it makes people happy?
Is it helping?

110
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,949
Can I say something?
Jean-Paul Sartre once wrote--

111
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,326
Boring!

112
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,078
-I got this.
-[stammers]

113
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,663
[Jason] I want to tell you about a guy

114
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,583
from my dance crew in Jacksonville
called Big Noodle.

115
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,044
Well, we gave it our best shot, guys.
It was nice knowing you.

116
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,381
I used to yell at Big Noodle, 'cause he
always showed up late to rehearsal.

117
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,468
Then one day,
the swamp under my house flooded.

118
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,263
I needed a place to crash,
so I slept at Big Noodle's house.

119
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:51,392
Turns out that he had to juggle three jobs
to take care of four grandparents,

120
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,437
who all lived in the same bed,
just like in <i>Willy Wonka.</i>

121
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,231
I never yelled at Big Noodle
for being late after that,

122
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,109
'cause I knew how hard it was
for him to be there.

123
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:04,113
And he definitely didn't have time
to research what tomatoes to buy,

124
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,448
even if he wanted to.

125
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,619
Possession of a non-fried vegetable
is a felony in Jacksonville.

126
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:15,416
The point is you can't judge humans,
because you don't know what we go through.

127
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,420
Amazingly, Your Honor, he's right.

128
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,757
I didn't really understand people
until I went to Earth.

129
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,967
Maybe you should give it a shot.

130
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,887
If you still don't see things our way,
then we'll drop it,

131
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,641
and you can, you know,
zappy-zappy-marble-marble.

132
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,732
Yeah, sure. I'll give it a shot.

133
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,610
I'll go down there,
see what you guys "go through,"

134
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:46,614
and then one way or another,
this is going to end.

135
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,909
Hey, do you guys know a good place
where I can get Mexican food?

136
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,329
Oh. [scoffs]
Mexico. Duh. [chuckles]

137
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,624
-[Michael] Oh.
-[Tahani sighs]

138
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,167
Well, how long will she be gone?

139
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,545
No way to tell. My guess is--

140
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:05,842
-Oh, brother, that was rough.
-Right?

141
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,220
Sheesh! Earth is a mess, y'all.

142
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,221
Woof!

143
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:15,226
Also, I guess I'm black, and they do not
like black ladies down there.

144
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,813
Crap, y'all. This is bad.

145
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,941
Where did you go, exactly?

146
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:26,070
Tanzania, Paraguay, Vietnam, Denmark...

147
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,240
It's terrible everywhere,
and always in a different way.

148
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,035
The only place I liked was Hawaii,
although I barely left the resort.

149
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,704
The last place I went

150
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,666
was a Black Friday sale
at an outlet mall in Michigan.

151
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,918
-Why?
-For the deals!

152
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,712
Earth stinks, y'all.

153
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:48,259
It's hot and it's crowded,
but somehow also cold and lonely.

154
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,096
I thought it was going to be so easy
to make good decisions.

155
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,225
The first thing I did was
I googled "big juicy natural tomatoes,"

156
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:01,939
which led me to a porn site
that was for people with a sunburn fetish?

157
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,358
-I kind of never recovered.
-[Michael] Right.

158
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,735
That's problem number one.

159
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,446
Life is chaotic and messy
and unpredictable.

160
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:13,701
Problem number two: even if you do somehow
manage to make good decisions,

161
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:17,497
you still lose points
because of the unintended consequences.

162
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,582
Yeah, there are booby traps everywhere.

163
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,920
There's this chicken sandwich that, if you
eat it, it means you hate gay people,

164
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:24,921
and it's delicious!

165
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,006
It is. It is so good.

166
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,717
I essentially tried to do
what you suggested.

167
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,802
I obsessed over every choice.

168
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,932
But that was also bad,
and I still got sent to the Bad Place.

169
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,558
So, I'm problem number three.

170
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,852
Oh, no,
you are nobody's problem, sweetheart.

171
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,481
[sighs] You know,
we gotta figure this out.

172
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,360
And then Turtle makes a bet
with Ronda Rousey,

173
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,862
and if she loses, she has to...
Oh, come on!

174
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,490
I was just in the middle of torturing
William Shakespeare

175
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,284
by describing the plot
to the <i>Entourage</i> movie. What is this?

176
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,578
Some new information
has come to my attention,

177
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,788
and I need a solution.

178
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,667
I want the Bad Place to weigh in on this.
First, let's have a change of scenery.

179
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,669
-[energy pulsates]
-[all exclaim]

180
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,130
[Janet] Remember, guys,
we're still in the IHOP, so be careful.

181
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:14,053
Shawn, I have reason to believe
that humans might be, on average,

182
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,596
better than the points system

183
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,681
-suggests they are.
-Hmm.

184
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,058
Counterpoint, humans are terrible.

185
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,937
Limp Bizkit, slavery,
the prosecution rests.

186
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,022
Gotta say, that's a solid rebuttal.

187
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,818
Look, there are plenty of awful people
and thoughtless jerks,

188
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,362
and I guess Nazis, again, somehow,

189
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,907
but there are also people
who are really trying to be good,

190
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,784
and they aren't getting close.

191
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:40,788
Because they're not good at being good,
because they're bad.

192
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:45,585
The score they got on Earth is how good
or bad they are, full stop, end of story.

193
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,797
Then why did these four get better,
over and over again, in my neighborhood?

194
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,759
Why did they help each other in ways
they had never helped anyone on Earth?

195
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,553
I don't know. Maybe it's a fluke.

196
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,055
Plus, you have zero proof
they did get better.

197
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,849
You didn't keep track of their points.

198
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,061
That's it! I know what we have to--
[yells]

199
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,023
[Janet] Oh.
He forgot we're still in the IHOP.

200
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,316
[Michael] Anybody got eyes on Chidi?

201
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,317
[Chidi in high-pitched voice] Help!

202
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,320
Help!

203
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,905
Can someone grab
my tiny boyfriend, please?

204
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,366
-I'm on it. And... got him!
-[Chidi screaming]

205
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,035
Ah. Here you go.

206
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,411
[yells]

207
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,580
[breathing shakily]

208
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:26,584
I just saw a trillion different realities

209
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:31,881
folding onto each other like thin sheets
of metal forming a single blade.

210
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,216
Yeah, yeah, the Time Knife,
we've all seen it.

211
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,510
-Let's get back on track, bud.
-[Chidi] Yeah, okay. Sure.

212
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,058
What I was saying, before, you know,
I saw the Time Knife...

213
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,644
is this:

214
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,729
Michael is right.

215
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,025
His neighborhood gave us the chance
to become better people

216
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,528
because it removed all the variables
that make life on Earth hard.

217
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:59,033
Yeah. There was no rent to pay,
no racism, no sexism.

218
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:03,287
No awards-show
gift-suite publicist in-fighting.

219
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,874
What?
Those gift suites can be a real minefield.

220
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,794
But Shawn is also right.

221
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,296
The four of us becoming
better people could be a fluke.

222
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,965
So, let's repeat the experiment.

223
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,260
It's what Simone taught us
about data collection.

224
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,888
Try it again,
and see if you get the same results.

225
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:25,059
Of course! I build a new neighborhood,
we choose four new people,

226
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,560
tell them they're in the Good Place,

227
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,355
create challenges for them,
track their progress.

228
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,650
My guess is they will do
what the original four did.

229
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,987
Seek help, support each other,
make wise decisions, improve.

230
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:43,160
If they do, then it's proof that humans
are not "bad, full stop, end of story."

231
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:47,748
This is so stupid. Where would you even
put this neighborhood?

232
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,000
I wouldn't allow it to be built
in the Good Place, that's for sure,

233
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,711
and I doubt you'd want to come back
to my neck of the woods.

234
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,463
[Eleanor] Ooh!

235
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,215
I have an idea.

236
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,637
Hi, Mindy. We need to use your backyard.

237
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,225
You need my backyard? For what?

238
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,227
We're conducting an important experiment--

239
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,353
You know what? I don't care.

240
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,481
In fact, as soon as I started
asking the question, I thought,

241
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,234
"Why are you asking this?
You don't care about the answer."

242
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,361
Do whatever you want.
Just leave me out of it.

243
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,906
And if you want to talk to someone,
talk to Derek.

244
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,825
I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.

245
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,412
Who's Derek?

246
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,832
Don't think of Derek as my ex-boyfriend.

247
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,085
I made him, so he's more like my son.

248
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,796
Although, I did make him
because I was jealous of you and Tahani,

249
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,340
so he's kind of my rebound booty call.

250
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,385
So... he's your son-rebound-booty-call.

251
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,181
Fine, if you want to put labels on it,
I guess he's my son-rebound-booty-call.

252
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,808
But he doesn't mean anything to me.

253
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,812
Also, Derek never really... worked right.

254
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,565
He's a buffoon.
You have nothing to worry about.

255
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,819
[Derek] "How should he love thee?
Or how deem thee wise?

256
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,156
Who wouldst not leave him
in his wandering?"

257
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:08,245
Oh, I didn't see you there.
I was just reciting some Edgar Allan Poe.

258
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,333
Hi, I'm Derek.
Welcome to the Medium Place.

259
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,418
[blowing bubbles]

260
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,296
Derek? Why are you so different?

261
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,839
You have Mindy to thank for that.

262
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,510
See, she found a plunger sticking out
of the ground behind our house.

263
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,803
And every time she hits it, I pass out.

264
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,557
When I come to, I'm a little bit smarter
and a little bit better.

265
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,810
Not to brag, but I almost have
a full-grown penis now.

266
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,563
It's resplendent and mostly functional.

267
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,775
-How many times has Mindy rebooted you?
-I don't know... half a million.

268
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,027
-What?
-[Derek] She reboots me a lot.

269
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,239
Sometimes when she's bored,
or just needs some "alone time."

270
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,823
Sometimes just for laughs.

271
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,993
[laughing] Derek.

272
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,828
Shall we head inside?

273
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,497
-Okay.
-Cool.

274
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,916
[Judge] <i>So, here are the rules.</i>

275
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,127
Michael designs the new neighborhood
however he wants.

276
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,755
The Bad Place
gets to choose the four new humans,

277
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:04,426
but they have to be the same general level
of badness as the original four.

278
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,221
All right?
No serial killers, no dictators,

279
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,305
no one who managed a boy band.

280
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:13,727
Michael will not get the files in advance,
so he does not have forever to plan,

281
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:18,399
but he can then change the neighborhood
however he wants.

282
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,317
Yeah, I have about
a billion objections to this.

283
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,153
-So do I.
-Good. That means it's a fair compromise.

284
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:28,033
So one last issue: where do we get
all the other residents for this place?

285
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,995
Well, my original neighborhood
was built for torture,

286
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,914
so everyone was a demon.
We can't have that.

287
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:38,252
-I say we get them from the Good Place.
-Over my dead skin-suit.

288
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,170
Well, what other option do we have?

289
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,340
Would anybody like a medium snack?

290
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,760
I, myself, will be enjoying
another classy martini.

291
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,429
Don't mind if I do.

292
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,891
[gasps] I can make the people.
Just like I made Derek.

293
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,309
-Are you sure?
-[Janet] Yes.

294
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,312
If the Judge restores my powers
in the Medium Place, I can do it.

295
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,897
They'll be way more advanced
than the original Derek.

296
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,773
-No offense.
-[Derek] None taken.

297
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,653
Okay. The other residents
will be comprised of Janet babies.

298
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,449
You will have one year of Earth time
to try to improve the humans.

299
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,368
I will be monitoring everything
to ensure there's no cheating,

300
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,162
and to track the humans' progress.

301
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,288
Deal?

302
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,500
-[electricity buzzes]
-[yells] Ow!

303
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,545
[laughing] Classic.

304
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,504
[laughs]

305
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,797
-[electricity buzzes]
-Ow!

306
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,137
-[clicks tongue and sighs] Janet?
-Hi, there.

307
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,097
-Ah. Yes.
-Ready to start building?

308
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,476
I have some ideas for how to design
a sort of basic neighborhood,

309
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,562
which we can then tailor to the guests
as we learn more about them.

310
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,232
-Now, when you say "some" ideas?
-I have 11 trillion ideas.

311
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,444
-Yes! I'm so glad you're here, Janet.
-Me, too.

312
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,866
All right. [clears throat]
So, what's your first "basic" idea?

313
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,827
[Michael exclaims]

314
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,413
Perfect. So basic.

315
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,123
[both laugh]

316
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,299
[Chidi] This house was built
to torture you.

317
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,427
Why did you have Michael
recreate it exactly?

318
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,847
Well, in the memories I watched,
this was where we fell in love.

319
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,892
So I figured, why mess with success?

320
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,269
I mean... [exclaims] what am I saying?

321
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,897
This house is stupid and you're lame
and I hate you.

322
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,065
I love you, too.

323
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,943
This is gonna be fun.

324
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,196
I mean, I know we have to help
these new people,

325
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,242
but most of the time we'll just get to
live together, like a normal couple.

326
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,328
We can chill out and just relax...

327
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,956
-Have sex.
-...and study philosophy...

328
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,500
-Horndog.
-Nerd.

329
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,003
[straining]

330
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,257
[exhales heavily]

331
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,469
-Hi. I'm Daphne.
-Hi, Daphne. I'm Janet. I made you.

332
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,640
Great. I'll wait for your instructions.
Thank you for making me. Bye.

333
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,561
Okay, Daphne's done.
Only another 185 people to go.

334
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,271
I'll check back in an hour.

335
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,232
You're doing so good, Janet.

336
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,901
Thanks, Jason.
Making people is exhausting.

337
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,111
[pings]

338
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,822
Can't help but notice
you're making a bunch of people.

339
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,074
You know, if we pooled our resources,

340
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,702
we could be done
in two shakes of a lamb's Derek.

341
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,996
Whatever.
Janet doesn't need your help, dude!

342
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,374
Actually, it would go a lot faster.
Thanks, Derek.

343
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,001
No problem. [snaps]

344
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,336
Don't worry,
this is purely professional, okay?

345
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,383
Now, be a pal and hold my classy martini
while I get down to business.

346
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,634
Let's make people.

347
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,138
[line ringing]

348
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,685
-Hello, Your Honor.
-[Shawn chuckles] <i>You fell for it! </i>

349
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:45,481
<i>It's me, Shawn.</i>
<i>Just wanted to wish you bad luck.</i>

350
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,108
Trying to psyche me out?
You must be scared.

351
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,485
<i>Oh, I'm very confident.</i>

352
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,446
<i>I think we've picked some excellent</i>
<i>subjects for your stupid experiment.</i>

353
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,073
<i>When you fail, and you will,</i>

354
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,284
<i>I've got something special cooked up</i>
<i>for your four little friends.</i>

355
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,913
Let me guess. They're gonna be
tortured with penis flatteners

356
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,749
and bees with teeth.
You are so predictable.

357
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,335
Why don't you at least switch it up
once in a while?

358
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,881
Try using teeth flatteners
and bees with penises.

359
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,300
<i>First of all, that's stupid. </i>

360
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,260
<i>But also, we are switching it up. </i>

361
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,138
<i>When you fail, the four humans</i>
<i>will be tortured for all eternity. </i>

362
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,474
<i>But guess who's going to be</i>
<i>doing the torturing?</i>

363
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,267
<i>Hello, idiot.</i>

364
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,769
[both laugh]

365
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,354
[Shawn] <i>We built a Michael suit. </i>

366
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,024
<i>The boys down in R&amp;D said it couldn't</i>
<i>be done, so I made it out of them.</i>

367
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,777
<i>That's Vicky in there right now,</i>
<i>taking you for a spin.</i>

368
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,614
<i>You are disgusting. Disgusting.</i>

369
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,825
<i>Michael. It's going to be so amazing,</i>

370
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,787
<i>watching your four BFFs look so sad</i>
<i>and betrayed and confused</i>

371
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,082
<i>as you, their reformed demon daddy,</i>
<i>unleash a swarm of...</i>

372
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,628
<i>penis-bees. I invented those. That was me.</i>

373
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,464
Well, I will just tell them
what you're going to do,

374
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,299
and they'll know it isn't really me.

375
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,510
<i>And we'll erase their memories</i>
<i>of you telling them.</i>

376
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,596
<i>Thanks for inventing that little trick,</i>
<i>by the way. Very useful. </i>

377
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,601
<i>Have fun, Michael. Enjoy everything</i>
<i>that is about to overwhelm you.</i>

378
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,895
[both] <i>Mmm, bye, bitch! </i>

379
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,652
[timer beeping]

380
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:19,116
So, how bad is contestant number one?
Murderer?

381
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,618
-[sighs]
-War criminal? Instagram DJ?

382
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,912
Uh, yeah. Uh...

383
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,915
-Are you okay?
-Mmm-hmm. Yep, just a little jittery.

384
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,879
Last time I designed a neighborhood,
things didn't really go according to plan.

385
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,465
Nah, plans are for wimps.
We should've done this Shellstrop-style.

386
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,260
Don't prepare at all,
get drunk the morning of the test,

387
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,553
BS our way through it,

388
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,765
and then brag about how we didn't even
study and still got a C-plus.

389
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,350
-[chuckles]
-So whatta we got, man?

390
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,436
I gotta go give
everyone a heads-up, remember?

391
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,816
His name is John. Some sort of journalist,
no major crimes or atrocities.

392
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,027
-Is he out there right now?
-Mmm-hmm.

393
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,030
[fountain babbling]

394
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,202
{\an8}Wow. That's freaky. [chuckles]

395
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,829
{\an8}So, based on initial skimming
of his file,

396
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:11,251
{\an8}-we will run scenario G48-190.
-Geez, Louise.

397
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,462
{\an8}Well, you have to be
prepared for anything.

398
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,547
{\an8}I mean, is John coming in
thinking that he belongs?

399
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,466
{\an8}Or does he know he definitely doesn't?

400
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,134
{\an8}Dude, dude, relax.

401
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,471
{\an8}All we have to do today is tell John
he's in the Good Place,

402
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,682
{\an8}show him around the neighborhood,
and get him to Tahani's welcome party.

403
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,227
{\an8}That's it.
We can deal with the rest later. Right?

404
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,144
{\an8}Right.

405
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,355
{\an8}-Right, right, right.
-Hey, listen...

406
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,857
Whatever your plan is,
it's gonna be great.

407
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:38,570
We trust you.
Your friends will always trust you.

408
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,447
{\an8}[timer chimes]

409
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,869
-Okay, here I go.
-Okay, I'm gonna...

410
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,331
Yup. Here I go.

411
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,418
I go here... [breathing heavily]

412
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,506
-and... I'm gone.
-Michael?

413
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,757
Oh, yeah. I'm gone.

414
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,384
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

415
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,718
I can't do this.

416
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,928
[John] Hello?

417
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,097
-Is anyone here?
-Michael, buddy.

418
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,434
John is awake. We need to open the door
and welcome him into the afterlife.

419
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,436
Remember? The whole plan?

420
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,231
I do remember. That's why I can't do it.

421
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,732
It's too scary.

422
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,360
[crying]

423
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,611
-No!
-[knocking at door]

424
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,737
[John] Hello?
