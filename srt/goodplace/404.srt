1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:01,960
Thirty seconds left.

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:04,087
-Come on.
-[John] Oh, oh! It's a butterfly.

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,173
Uh, it's Mariah Carey's
lower back butterfly tattoo.

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,133
Yes.

5
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,175
[all cheer and laugh]

6
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,593
Well done, John.

7
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,055
And because you guessed correctly,
watch what happens.

8
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,226
[Tahani gasps and laughs]

9
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,062
-Oh!
-Oh! [laughs]

10
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,564
I should've gotten that sooner.

11
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,774
I wrote my college thesis
on that back tattoo.

12
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,234
Yes, because remember,

13
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,362
every picture from tonight will have
something to do with your lives on Earth,

14
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,156
so you can get to know each other
a little bit better.

15
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,282
Okay, blue team, you're up.

16
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,742
Go get 'em, Chippy.

17
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,076
Chidi, it's your turn!

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,705
[chuckles] Oh! I'm a decent artist,
but I'm not so great under pressure.

19
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,415
Your time begins now.

20
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,625
Oh, boy. Okay. Uh...

21
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,419
You got this, Chidi.

22
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,504
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to figure out
how to start...

23
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,047
Come on, just start drawing, my brotha.

24
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:52,302
Oh, no. No, no, no.

25
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,429
-Thirty seconds.
-[exclaims] Okay, here we go.

26
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,558
Oh. Uh... It's a submarine?

27
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,934
Looks like broccoli with teeth.

28
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,104
Oh, oh! It's a horse
with a bow on its neck.

29
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,648
-Oh, is it my childhood pony, Daisy?
-Yes!

30
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,108
[all cheering]

31
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,193
-[horse neighs]
-Oh, no.

32
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:09,944
No!

33
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,196
[horse roars]

34
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,739
[all screaming]

35
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,869
-What have I done?
-You made a frickin' Frankenstein, man.

36
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:22,040
Okay, you know what?
<i>Magic Pictionary</i> is over now,

37
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,583
so let's all go home and get some sleep.

38
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,876
You guys want me to kill it?

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,085
I've shot a lot of racehorses.

40
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,921
-[neighs]
-Okay.

41
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,639
Fork me. That was a disaster.

42
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,349
How did that go so wrong?

43
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,018
{\an8}Well, for one thing,
Brent got super wasted.

44
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,102
{\an8}We should have cut him off.

45
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,731
{\an8}Nobody gets cut off in the Good Place.
If he asks for beer, I give him a beer.

46
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:50,610
{\an8}I'm just glad he stopped asking me to go
to dinner so we could discuss my career.

47
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:54,447
{\an8}Man, we haven't done a successful activity
in three weeks. We're ice cold.

48
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,741
{\an8}Guys, give yourself a break.
They're getting better.

49
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,245
{\an8}Brent's stopped saying "Daddy like"
all the time. That's something.

50
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,746
{\an8}Something feels off.

51
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,164
{\an8}All right, we need new ideas.

52
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,834
{\an8}I say we hole up here
for an all-night brainstorming session.

53
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,419
{\an8}Now, just hang on.
We're working really hard.

54
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,881
{\an8}And we need to relax occasionally
or we're gonna burn out.

55
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,718
{\an8}So, let's just clear our brain,
watch a movie or... Oh!

56
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,470
We'll have a slumber party.

57
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,890
[beeping]

58
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,934
{\an8}What the fork?

59
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,360
Whoever you are, show yourself!

60
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,910
Oh. Hold on,
the hood is caught in my glasses.

61
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,455
Hi!

62
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,041
I'm Glenn from the Bad Place.

63
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,794
{\an8}-What are you doing here?
-Yeah, what do you want, creep?

64
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,590
{\an8}No one knows I'm here,
and I have some important information.

65
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,592
{\an8}Eleanor, I need to speak with you alone.

66
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,219
{\an8}Whatever you need to say to me,
you can say right here.

67
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,679
{\an8}I don't think I should.

68
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,224
{\an8}It would lead to
a very uncomfortable social situation.

69
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,601
Say it.

70
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,394
That's not Michael.

71
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:12,191
That's Vicky the demon, in a Michael suit,
and she's sabotaging your experiment.

72
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,030
You see? It's uncomfortable.

73
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,325
All right, just sit there quietly
until we sort all this out.

74
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,828
If it's not too much trouble,
could I get a hot glass of pig urine?

75
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,247
-We need to talk.
-[Glenn] Or...

76
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,958
I'm not picky.
Whatever urine you have is fine.

77
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,379
Eleanor, you have to believe me.
I'm Michael. He's lying.

78
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,466
Calm down, dude. I trust you.

79
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,135
But I'm gonna make Glenn think
I don't trust you.

80
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,805
Somehow, this has to be related
to the problems we've been having here,

81
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,265
and we need to figure out
what game they're playing.

82
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,435
Oh, that's good.
I like the way you think, Shellstrop.

83
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,147
I mean...
I hate the way you think, Shellstrop.

84
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,441
-Is he buying it?
-He's not looking.

85
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,737
I'll tell you whatever you wanna know,
but shouldn't we call the Judge?

86
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,530
We're not calling anyone
until we figure some things out.

87
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,448
We have questions.

88
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,785
Yeah, for example, if you're a devil,
how come you're not wearing Prada?

89
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,955
[gasps] Caramel!

90
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,331
Why would you help us?

91
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,669
One day, you're flattening penises
and the next, you just decide to defect?

92
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,421
[chuckling] Actually, one of my jobs
was to reinflate the penises,

93
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,673
so they could get flattened again.

94
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,715
It doesn't matter.

95
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,844
Listen, I loved to torture humans
because I thought they deserved it.

96
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,597
They said everyone in the Bad Place
was evil and beyond repair.

97
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,891
I don't know if I believe that anymore.

98
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,812
Also, Shawn is so mean, you guys.

99
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,148
He yells at me all the time.
It's unnecessary.

100
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,985
[Jason] I feel you, dawg.
I was yelled at my whole life.

101
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,529
People were always like,

102
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,698
"You didn't pay for that."
"How do you plead?"

103
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,449
"He's flatlining. Clear!"

104
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,370
Okay, well, if that's Vicky,
what's the Bad Place's plan?

105
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,747
To sow chaos,
turn you guys against each other,

106
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,249
ruin the experiment.

107
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,709
Also, I have proof that's not Michael.

108
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,878
Here are pictures of Vicky
wearing the Michael suit.

109
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,714
[Eleanor] This doesn't prove anything.

110
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,049
These could just be pictures
of the real Michael.

111
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:00,967
[Glenn] They're real.

112
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,970
I know, because I helped make the suit.

113
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,432
We couldn't figure out
how to make it contain your demon essence,

114
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,809
so you'll have to wear it
over the Vicky suit.

115
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:14,605
Ugh. Really? You're the worst, Glenn.
Let's do it. Zip her up.

116
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:19,736
Okay, but if I melt,
I'm gonna be so annoyed.

117
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,741
Oh.

118
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,326
Pretty well-made.

119
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:31,497
I can really feel all the musty skin folds
and the dangly bits.

120
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,249
The voice is perfect.

121
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,917
You sound so much like him
I wanna punch you.

122
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,589
Are we sure it's okay that we made this?
What are you gonna use it for?

123
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,965
[in squeaky voice]
"What are you gonna use it..."

124
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,216
[in normal voice] Shut up, Glenn!

125
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,384
The experiment is about to begin.

126
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,512
Let's call the real Michael and send him
spiraling down the toilet bowl,

127
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,097
like the pinched turd he is.

128
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,683
Well, now we know you're lying,

129
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,020
because Michael
would have definitely told us

130
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,814
if the Bad Place had called him
and showed him some freakin' Michael suit.

131
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,566
Absolutely. Of course I would've.

132
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,736
Janet would have phone records.
You can just ask her to pull them up.

133
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,864
-Okay, fine, I lied. They called me.
-What?

134
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,283
I lied about that and I'm sorry.

135
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:11,370
-You knew about this?
-Yes, but there's a good explanation.

136
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:15,166
Yeah, the explanation is that's Vicky,
and she's lying to you about everything.

137
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,418
Call the Judge
and we'll settle this once and for all.

138
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,837
Or is that exactly what you want us to do?

139
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,672
That is what I want you to do.

140
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,382
Exactly.

141
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,843
[Tahani] Eleanor,
perhaps we should call the Judge.

142
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,512
Glenn was telling the truth.

143
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,098
No, the Judge said
if anything else went wrong,

144
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,599
she would reset the whole experiment.

145
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,352
We are not calling her
unless we have no other choice,

146
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,231
and I am locking you two jamokes
in separate rooms

147
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,649
until we get to the bottom of this.

148
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,109
[groans]

149
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,195
I'm very upset about this development.

150
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,031
I'm serious, man. This is happening.

151
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,574
Oh.

152
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,453
I'm very upset about this development.

153
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,748
[Eleanor] All right, buttheads,
what do we do?

154
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,544
-I say we trust Michael. He's our friend.
-Well, he might be our friend.

155
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,797
Or he might be a lying trickster
who just looks like our friend.

156
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,549
The classic Mary Kate Olsen.

157
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,510
I have to say,
we've had a lot of misfires recently,

158
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,387
and Michael has been acting suspiciously.

159
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,347
Like, tonight, when I wanted to work,

160
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,516
and he just wanted
to have a slumber party instead.

161
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,601
To be fair to Mike, slumber parties rule.

162
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,438
And why would we trust Glenn?
He's a demon.

163
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,023
So's Michael. Demons can be good.

164
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,568
Right. Okay, so it's decided.
[claps] We trust both of them.

165
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,488
Okay, predictably, this was unhelpful.

166
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,950
Get in there.

167
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,745
What is all this stuff?

168
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,330
Are these weapons?

169
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,624
Ooh! Don't touch those. [laughs]

170
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,626
Those are my special magnet handcuffs.

171
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,131
They make me feel silly when Mindy and I
are playing Upstairs-Downstairs Derek.

172
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,717
Oh, they're sex toys.
[gasps] Ugh! They're sex toys!

173
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,844
Dude, get out of here.
We have enough problems.

174
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,012
[sighs]

175
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,140
My good man, allow me to bury the hatchet.

176
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:59,770
Being rebooted again has evolved me
past any feelings of jealousy.

177
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,440
-[chimes]
-Ho-ho! I know that sound.

178
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,066
Looks like someone found my sex diaper.

179
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,944
I'll leave you guys alone
to live that dipe-life.

180
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,654
-Ugh!
-[exclaims]

181
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:14,035
Okay, explain yourself.
If your self even is yourself.

182
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,953
I am Michael.

183
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,123
Shawn did call me,
and I saw the Michael suit.

184
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,000
He said if the experiment failed,

185
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,921
he was going to use it
to make you think I was torturing you.

186
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,339
Why didn't you tell us?

187
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:30,009
Because he said he would just erase
your memories of me telling you,

188
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,552
so it wouldn't matter anyway.

189
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,180
He knew that I would crumble
under the pressure.

190
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:38,684
But a month ago, you told me
you only pretended to freak out,

191
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,895
in order to get me to step up
and become a leader.

192
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:45,691
Yes. That also was a lie,
but it was an inspirational one, like...

193
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,237
"So great running into you.
We should get coffee sometime,"

194
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,948
-Or all of Instagram.
-[Eleanor] So, to recap:

195
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,535
You found out the Bad Place
made a Michael suit,

196
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,495
freaked out, didn't tell us why.

197
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:01,916
And then later you lied to me
about why you freaked out.

198
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,544
And then you lied again
just a few minutes ago

199
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,462
when you said that
you never got a call from Shawn.

200
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,299
Yes, but that lie was only
to cover my two earlier lies.

201
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,386
-I mean, that's gotta be okay, right?
-What?

202
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,012
Eleanor, don't you see what they're doing?

203
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,224
Shawn sent Glenn
to undermine our trust in each other,

204
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,102
so you'll call the Judge
and restart the experiment.

205
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,188
Well, I have no reason not to believe you.

206
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,066
Other than the three very recent examples
we just laid out.

207
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,442
Huddle. Now.

208
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,361
[door opens and closes]

209
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,322
Oh! Hey, sorry.

210
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,701
I just needed to grab this.
You know, it's chime time.

211
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,038
There's gotta be a way
to figure out if that's the real Michael.

212
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,959
Is there a way you can make
some sort of demon lie detector?

213
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,460
Oof. I don't know.

214
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,337
The Janet babies are still draining me,

215
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,215
and I just had to put down
Daisy the horse-blob,

216
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,552
which was exhausting,
emotionally and physically.

217
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,137
She fought back. I won't get into details.

218
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,516
I had to twist her head off.
Sorry, no more details.

219
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,686
-She did thrash. She thrashed. Sorry.
-[Eleanor] Okay.

220
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,439
Why don't we just get him drunk
so he starts blabbing?

221
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,692
I mean, what goes best with pig urine?

222
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,902
-Coconut rum.
-[Janet] That won't work on a demon.

223
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,446
I'll try and make a lie detector.

224
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,366
-[Michael] Oh, no, damn it!
-What's going on in there?

225
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,453
-I touched the dang diaper!
-Get back in that room.

226
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,749
So Michael saw the suit. Big deal.
I still think you're forking with us.

227
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,252
I think this is just like
when the Bad Place sent us Linda,

228
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,755
who turned out to be
some super-jacked punching guy,

229
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,798
and just like him, you got busted.

230
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,133
That's the thing.

231
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,845
The puncher didn't get busted.
It worked exactly as planned.

232
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,390
<i>The whole thing was a diversion </i>
<i>to get real Michael out</i>

233
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,559
<i>and sneak the impostor in on a train.</i>

234
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,186
It must've happened during the handoff.

235
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,563
<i>While Janet was handcuffing Chris,</i>

236
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,566
<i>a bunch of demons must've grabbed Michael,</i>
<i>yanked him away,</i>

237
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,986
<i>and then Vicky, in the Michael suit,</i>
<i>walked back out.</i>

238
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,655
<i>You never would have known the difference.</i>

239
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,991
<i>Also, when Chris got back,</i>
<i>I saw Shawn and him celebrating. </i>

240
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,786
<i>Why would they be happy</i>
<i>if he wasn't supposed to get caught?</i>

241
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,954
Man, I love a good sabotage.

242
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,707
Or is that exactly
what you want us to think?

243
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,000
[Eleanor] Motherforker.

244
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,461
I knew there was something
weird about that puncher.

245
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,129
I said that to Michael...

246
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,548
and he dismissed it.

247
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,843
-[speaks gibberish] See what I mean?
-Don't go anywhere.

248
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:18,886
Come on.

249
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,224
If Michael is just Vicky
in a Michael suit,

250
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,433
let's just take the suit off.

251
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,895
Yeah, maybe we can sneak up behind him
and try and pants him from the forehead.

252
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:28,896
That won't work.

253
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,857
A demon can take his own skin suit off,
but no one else can.

254
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,984
It's like a very complicated bra.

255
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,570
Well, so be it.

256
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,822
[door opens]

257
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,157
Take off your skin suit.

258
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,244
-I can't.
-Sure, you can.

259
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,330
You're either a demon wearing
a Michael suit,

260
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:51,627
or you're a demon wearing a Vicky suit,
who's wearing a Michael suit over that.

261
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,548
Just take off your Michael suit
and show us what you're working with.

262
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,967
I'm sorry, I won't.

263
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,885
-That's very suspicious.
-I know.

264
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,095
But I'm not Vicky.

265
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,347
I just don't want to show you
what's underneath here.

266
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,766
I've seen a lot of weird hogs
in my life, dude.

267
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,767
Get over yourself.

268
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,269
That's not it.

269
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,772
I'm a fire squid.

270
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,191
Dope.

271
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,069
No, not dope.

272
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,824
I'm a 6,000-foot tall fire squid.

273
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,870
I have tentacles.
There's teeth everywhere.

274
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:32,585
I'm on fire, and my neck is long,
and there's a smell and lots of juice.

275
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,045
[breathing heavily]
There's so much juice, Eleanor.

276
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,841
I think I speak for everyone here
when I say...

277
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,718
I really have to see this.

278
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:45,764
So, you're not gonna take off
your demon Spanx because you're shy?

279
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,683
That's convenient.

280
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:51,604
Eleanor, if I take off this suit,
I will crash through the roof,

281
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:55,900
and the entire neighborhood will see me,
and the experiment will be blown.

282
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,693
But it's more than that.

283
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,613
You guys will never look at me
the same way again.

284
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,365
I won't just be Michael.

285
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:09,997
I'll be some disgusting mass
of burning tentacles.

286
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,751
Do you really wanna be friends
with something like that?

287
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,753
Yes! I keep saying.

288
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,129
Eleanor.

289
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,466
Now, I don't know if this will work,

290
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,219
but, theoretically,
if you point it at a demon and he's lying,

291
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,637
it'll turn red.

292
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,138
If he's telling the truth,
it'll turn green.

293
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,056
[Eleanor] Okay.

294
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:32,478
Glenn, this is a lie detector.
Let us show you how it works.

295
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,521
[lie detector hums]

296
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,688
What's your name?

297
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,857
Well, everyone calls me Glenn,

298
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:42,696
but the name on my demon certificate
is actually Snakes Pour Forth From His--

299
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,201
[Janet and Tahani exclaiming]

300
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,662
Glenn blew up. Glenn blew up.

301
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,790
Or is that exactly
what he wants us to think?

302
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,506
So, does blowing up mean
he was telling the truth or lying?

303
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,134
Neither. That was not supposed to happen.
I've never killed anybody before.

304
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,387
No, don't worry, demons can't die.

305
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,807
He'll slowly re-form himself
over a few months,

306
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,977
passing through
all the stages of demon growth:

307
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,439
larva, slug monster,
spooky little girl, teenage boy,

308
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,608
giant ball of tongues,

309
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,362
social media CEO,
and then finally, demon.

310
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,156
So, look at the bright side.
This worked out perfectly.

311
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,120
I mean, not for Glenn, obviously,
but for us.

312
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,914
The lying demon's gone.
We're still here. All good.

313
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,126
No. We're not "all good," man.

314
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,130
You're either Michael and you lied,
or you're Vicky in a Michael suit.

315
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,633
Okay, I'm gonna go for a walk.
Nobody go anywhere.

316
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,308
-Chidi?
-Hey.

317
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,768
Hey. I didn't think
anyone would still be up.

318
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,855
Are you okay?

319
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,064
Uh, yeah, yeah.

320
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,736
Um, I'm just practicing
drawing viable horses.

321
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,448
Ones that aren't crimes against nature.

322
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,283
Okay, I know this mood of yours.

323
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,745
From reading your file and whatnot.

324
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:17,249
Um, why don't you take a break
and we'll get some food in you?

325
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,420
[Janet] Well, I'm done.

326
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,256
I scooped it all up into
one steaming pile of Glenn.

327
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,468
Maybe I can put him back together.
I'm hella good at puzzles.

328
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,346
I finished this word search in 30 seconds.

329
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,805
[Janet] Jason, I feel terrible.

330
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,683
I know he was a demon,
and he may have lied to us,

331
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,894
but he didn't deserve that.

332
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,479
You were only trying to help us.

333
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,815
Look, I know this is a weird time,

334
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,902
but if you ever wanna talk,
just know that I'm here for you, girl.

335
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,323
Thanks, Jason. That means a lot.

336
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,872
Mmm! I gotta say,

337
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,292
out of all the "human stuff" I've been
able to experience in this neighborhood,

338
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,878
nachos? Number one. Easy.

339
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,837
Really?

340
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,297
Yeah.

341
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:10,177
I mean, salty, crunchy, cheesy,
little bit of a kick.

342
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,554
Name one better thing humans have created.

343
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,391
-The Sistine Chapel?
-Pfft! Paint on a ceiling.

344
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,435
I mean, it's fine,
but can you eat it at the movies?

345
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,979
Touché.

346
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,774
Listen, don't stay up all night
drawing horses. It's really fine.

347
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:29,613
I know. I just feel like
I made the world a little bit worse,

348
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,283
and I won't be okay
until I make it better again.

349
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:37,538
Making yourself miserable
to ease the suffering of others.

350
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,623
About the most Chidi thing you can do.

351
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,668
I'll see you later.

352
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,672
Do you wanna take
the rest of those nachos with you?

353
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,965
Yeah, I do, thank you.

354
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,513
Okay, here's where I'm at.
I just don't know if I can ever trust you.

355
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,307
I'm gonna call the Judge.
We'll start over.

356
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,185
We won't have Chidi in the mix,
but he'll be on our side again,

357
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,979
which is almost as good.

358
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,522
But we know the humans now.

359
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,567
-Starting over sounds exhausting.
-[Eleanor] I know.

360
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,943
But if that's not Michael,

361
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,447
he could sabotage us
in ways we can't even perceive.

362
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,158
And even if it is,
I can't fully trust him,

363
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,245
so every time something goes wrong,
a little part of me is gonna wonder.

364
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,164
We have to start over.

365
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,624
I have a better idea.

366
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,461
-I'm gonna blow myself up.
-[Tahani and Eleanor] What?

367
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,628
I'll blow myself up.

368
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,340
That way, you can continue the experiment
with Chidi as one of the people,

369
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,510
which is our best chance
to ever be successful.

370
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,222
Why not just lock you in a room,
or in Janet's void or something?

371
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,475
But then you might worry that I'd escape.

372
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,477
If I blow myself up,
I'm out of your hair for good.

373
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,939
Well, parts of me will be
in your actual hair, but you get it.

374
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,859
-Michael, wait--
-Tahani, this is the only way.

375
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,820
There's literally nothing I can say
that will make you realize

376
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,572
that I'm really me.

377
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,408
Oh, boy. This is gonna suck.

378
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,244
Hopefully, I will see you all
in a few months. Good luck.

379
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,707
Oh, and make sure you, uh,
get all of me into the container,

380
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:09,129
or I might come back, uh, way shorter,
and that would bum me out.

381
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,547
[lie detector hums]

382
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,802
I wish I were saying this
in different circumstances, but...

383
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,805
take it sleazy.

384
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,972
[Jason] Michael, wait!

385
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,144
Oh, crud-nuts!

386
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,565
Jason, how did you know
that was Bad Janet?

387
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,692
Michael said there's nothing he could say

388
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,903
that would make you realize
he's really him.

389
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,280
But Janet does have a thing she can say

390
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,117
that does make me realize
she is really not her.

391
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,409
What?

392
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,204
I called Janet "girl,"
but she didn't say "not a girl."

393
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,374
The real Janet always says "not a girl."

394
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,876
[gasps] Oh, wow.

395
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,381
That realization's the only thing that
stopped me from becoming a pile of goo.

396
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,423
-Ugh.
-[Tahani] Ugh!

397
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,008
[Eleanor] Wait, how did you pull it off?

398
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,261
You were outside on the platform with me
the whole time.

399
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:01,557
We brought two Bad Janets on the train,
you dumb, dumb idiot.

400
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,101
<i>The other one </i>
<i>distracted you on the platform</i>

401
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,478
<i>while Good Janet brought Chris </i>
<i>on to the train.</i>

402
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:11,150
<i>I snuck out, marbleized Janet</i>
<i>and then I took over, baby.</i>

403
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,193
<i>Stupid Michael never knew.</i>

404
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,863
I had you fart-knockers fooled for weeks.

405
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:20,325
Until Glenn, the traitor,
ruined everything. That guy sucks, right?

406
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,120
-[squelches]
-Shut up, Glenn.

407
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,707
Wait, wait, wait. Bad Janets can't
impersonate Good Janets.

408
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,542
I've seen them try.
Their heads melt, so...

409
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,836
Oh. Oh, you're so smart, sir.

410
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,965
Well, listen, here's the thing.
Shawn rebooted me 40 million tines.

411
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,677
Wait, tine-mis. Timeses.

412
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,929
These things rule.

413
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,391
Oh, dip, this means Janet didn't dump me.
Her weird sister did!

414
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,518
Everything makes so much more sense.

415
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,521
All of Janet's ideas
were so counterproductive.

416
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,398
She brought the horse monster to life.

417
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,109
She forced me to antagonize John.

418
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,404
She got us to doubt
Eleanor's leadership skills.

419
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,406
Oh, I was just about to launch an idea

420
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,992
where Tahani was gonna give herself
an asymmetrical haircut.

421
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,329
{\an8}-You monster.
-Thank you.

422
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,331
{\an8}Guys, we still have a problem here.

423
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,833
{\an8}You still don't have evidence
that I'm actually me.

424
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,210
{\an8}Sure, we do.

425
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,921
{\an8}You offered to sacrifice yourself
to help a bunch of cockroaches.

426
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,299
{\an8}That's about the most Michael thing
you can do.

427
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,427
{\an8}Where's real Janet?

428
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,179
{\an8}[laughs] Oh, she's in the Bad Place.

429
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,766
{\an8}She's probably wiping her butt
with her own butt. [laughs]

430
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,853
{\an8}I can't bear the idea of poor Janet
down there, all alone.

431
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,105
{\an8}[sighs] What should we do?

432
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,441
I know what to do.

433
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,818
It's like what that guy
who blew up said...

434
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,738
Shawn's a bully.

435
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:44,159
And sometimes the only thing a bully
understands is a punch in the mouth.

436
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,163
I'm gonna go down there,
I'm gonna punch him in the mouth

437
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,666
and I'm gonna get Janet back.

438
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,085
[exclaims] Sounds like
somebody has a plan.

439
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,044
Dope.

440
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,255
Uh, where is he? What's the plan?

441
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,714
It's okay.

442
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,762
-You sure you can hold down the fort?
-Not at all.

443
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,139
-You sure you can do your thing?
-Nope.

444
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,976
We'll just try our best, right?

445
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,229
Okay. Let's go get our girl.

446
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,273
Not a girl.
