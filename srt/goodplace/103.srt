1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:04,587
So, Aristotle was Plato's student.

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,383
And Aristotle believes
that your character is voluntary,

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,928
because it's just the result
of your actions,

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:15,015
which are under your control.

5
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,809
For example, right now,

6
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,687
you have made the insane choice
to ignore the person

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,232
who is literally trying to
save you from eternal damnation.

8
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,900
No, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

9
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,527
Uh, I just...

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,030
Are we sure we should be paying
attention to these guys?

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,866
It's like, who died and left Aristotle
in charge of ethics?

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,326
Plato.

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,411
[knock on door]

14
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,871
Uh, coming!

15
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,081
Uh, we're just... Kissing.

16
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,168
-And groping?
-[softly] What?

17
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,839
Hello.

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,301
Tahani. Hi. What brings you here?

19
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,471
You know, I was just, uh,
in the neighborhood. [laughs]

20
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,181
Do you get it, Eleanor?

21
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,974
Because, you know,
we're all in the same afterlife,

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,517
so, you know,
I'm always in the neighborhood.

23
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,852
Do you get it?

24
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,772
I do, and it's delightful.

25
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,357
Anyway, this is for you.

26
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,734
Just a housewarming plant.

27
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,070
It's a little reminder that
if there's ever anything that you need,

28
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,529
I am right next door.

29
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,864
How could I possibly forget?

30
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,367
-Have a great day, Tahani!
-Oh, all right.

31
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,161
[door slams]

32
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,080
Ugh. Tahani.

33
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,540
[in British accent]
Welcome to the neighborhood.

34
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,542
Even though we all arrived here
at the same time.

35
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,962
Here's some dirt I put in a bowl
because I'm amazing.

36
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,255
[slams]

37
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,758
I thought it was kind of a nice gesture.

38
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,218
[in normal voice] Oh, Chidi.

39
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,387
It's a total con.
I see through her little act.

40
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,517
Her act of being a nice person
who brings you gifts?

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,768
-Bingo.
-Okay.

42
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,937
I'll... I'll remind you
that you're trying to learn

43
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,314
-how to be a good person.
-Mmm-hmm.

44
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,275
Maybe you should return the favor
and bring her something.

45
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,321
Oh, so now I'm supposed
to be nice and make friends

46
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,365
and treat her with mutual respect?

47
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,282
Yeah.

48
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,660
That's exactly what she wants
me to do, Chidi.

49
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,203
Wake up!

50
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,624
That, that's what everyone
wants everyone to do.

51
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,051
Hello, Chidi.
No frozen yogurt for you this morning?

52
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,345
{\an8}Oh, uh, no, just, uh, doing some reading.

53
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,596
{\an8}Ugh, been there, brother.

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,057
{\an8}Workin' hard or hardly workin',
am I right?

55
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,810
-Hump day.
-Uh, sorry.

56
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,812
{\an8}Janet's functioning as my assistant,

57
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,939
{\an8}but she's a little stiff, so I've been
trying to get her

58
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,441
{\an8}to be a little more casual
and conversational.

59
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,070
{\an8}-I'll have what she's having.
-It's a work in progress.

60
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,574
{\an8}Listen, Chidi.
I've been studying your file.

61
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,576
{\an8}You're a very interesting case.

62
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,537
{\an8}You essentially only did one thing
while you were on Earth.

63
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,581
{\an8}You thought and wrote about ethics.

64
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,126
{\an8}Yes, I spent 18 years
working on my manuscript called,

65
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,129
{\an8}<i>-Who We Are and Who We Are Not...</i>
-Right. No, no, no.

66
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,550
{\an8}<i>Practical Ethics and Their Application </i>
<i>in the Modern World; A Treatise on--</i>

67
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,885
Yes, yes, yes, that's the one.

68
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,052
-That's the one.
-Mmm-hmm.

69
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,847
{\an8}I think you should experience
new adventures.

70
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,933
{\an8}You know, do things that you
haven't done on Earth, right?

71
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,478
{\an8}So why don't we meet tomorrow
and try out some new hobbies.

72
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,355
{\an8}Uh, why not? [chuckles softly]

73
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,940
{\an8}I'll see you guys tomorrow.

74
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,317
Not if I see you first.

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,985
Where's the beef?

76
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,905
-[chuckles] I don't know.
-[Janet] Hump day.

77
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,489
[knocking]

78
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,117
{\an8}Hello, Eleanor.

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,037
{\an8}Jianyu, darling, look,
it's Eleanor from next door.

80
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,163
Is he asleep?

81
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,958
{\an8}Yeah, there's really no way to tell.
Come on in.

82
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,085
What brings you to our home, my dear?

83
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,255
Well, I'm simply repaying your kind gift

84
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,507
with a housewarming gift of my own.

85
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,425
Fresh pears.

86
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,554
It's a plant, just like your gift,
but you can actually eat them.

87
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,389
So maybe it's a better gift.

88
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,226
-Who's to say?
-That's so kind.

89
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,938
However, in, um, Chinese culture,
pears are actually a symbol of bad luck.

90
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,981
And I wouldn't want to offend Jianyu,

91
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,108
so I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to throw these in the garbage.

92
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,985
But do come and sit down.

93
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,614
We haven't even had a chance

94
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,866
to discuss all of the mayhem
in our neighborhood yet.

95
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,576
-It's so disconcerting.
-Yes.

96
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,495
What do you think is causing it?

97
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,581
Oh, I'm sure I don't know.
But we must keep our heads up.

98
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,000
In fact, tomorrow
I'm actually going door-to-door

99
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,795
to make sure that every single person
in this entire neighborhood

100
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,214
is keeping calm and carrying on.

101
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,341
'Cause I think that helping
others will make me feel

102
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,760
like I truly belong here, you know?

103
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,350
Here's a brainstorm,
why don't I go with you?

104
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,020
I mean, I would love to do
my part to help the neighborhood,

105
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,606
not to mention, get a little
bonding time with you, lady.

106
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,983
Oh, hurrah!

107
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,819
[Tahani] Such fun.

108
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,321
[Eleanor] I'm telling you,
Tahani's out to get me.

109
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,907
[stammers] What are you talking about?

110
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,994
This note was slipped
under my door yesterday.

111
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,955
It has to be Tahani.

112
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,458
She just said to me... [in British accent]
"I want to feel like I truly belong here."

113
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,003
Well, where have I seen
the word "belong" recently?

114
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,713
Oh, yeah, kaplow!

115
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,924
I really don't think she's the type
of person who would write this.

116
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,802
She is that kind of person
and she did write it.

117
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,014
She wants everybody to think
she's such a perfect princess

118
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,349
just 'cause she's tall and glamorous

119
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,602
and has cappuccino skin
and curves everywhere.

120
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,647
And now I'm complimenting her.
And kind of turned on.

121
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,191
The point is, she straight up sucks, bro.

122
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,401
[chiming and rustling]

123
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,237
Whoa.

124
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,697
Typical Tahani.

125
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,409
Brings us a faulty plant so she can brag
about being a better gardener.

126
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:32,165
No, I think this is another way in which
your negative actions affect this world.

127
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,251
This plant represents
your relationship to Tahani,

128
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,255
so when you're mean to her,
it starts to wilt.

129
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,049
Well, then this plant is doomed

130
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,009
because tomorrow, I'm going with her
and I'm gonna prove to you

131
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,846
and to everyone that she is
secretly a two-faced,

132
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,681
calculating, phony bench.

133
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,893
-[whining]
-Hmm. Yeah.

134
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,270
Truth hurts, doesn't it, plant?

135
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,442
So, all I want to do is just check in,
see how everyone's holding up.

136
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,111
Just bring some cheer
to these extraordinary people.

137
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,696
Cool.

138
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,907
So, tell me about yourself.

139
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,034
I mean, I want to hear it all, girlfriend.

140
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,703
The good, the bad, the really bad,

141
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,207
the embarrassing,
the humiliating, just... Let's bond.

142
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,669
Okay, well I was born in Pakistan,
raised in London, schooled in Paris,

143
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,755
but I think the primary reason
that I'm in The Good Place

144
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,299
is that I raised quite a lot of money
for non-profit groups.

145
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,675
Oh.

146
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,428
Did you ever, uh, skim a little
off the top for yourself?

147
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,432
Gracious, no, no!
Every penny was accounted for.

148
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,811
And as I raised nearly $60,000,000,000,
there was quite a lot of pennies.

149
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,062
[chuckles]

150
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,106
But I also dabbled
in some other professions.

151
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,734
I was a model, a museum curator,
an "It Girl," and...

152
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,070
Oh, I was Baz Luhrmann's muse for a while.

153
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,154
That was quite fun.

154
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,698
Modeling? That's a crazy life.

155
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,326
Want to tell me about that
rock bottom you probably hit?

156
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,246
Oh, I didn't really do it for long.
Couture just doesn't fit my body.

157
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,455
I'm cursed with ample bosom.

158
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,332
And yet you soldier on.

159
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,583
Oh, this is silly...

160
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,503
So "Tahani" means
"congratulations" in Arabic.

161
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,046
And "Al-Jamil" means "beautiful,"

162
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,757
-so my full name altogether means...
-"Congratulations, Beautiful."

163
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,176
Thanks, Eleanor. You big flirt. [giggles]

164
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,013
[coin clinks]

165
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,850
-Hey, babe, got you coffee.
-Oh, great.

166
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,935
Oh, Andy's Coffee, uh,
we shouldn't go there.

167
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,145
Everybody's boycotting.

168
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,981
Yeah, I know that one guy
found a scorpion in his latte.

169
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,816
I don't really care, though,
'cause it's so close to here.

170
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,943
No, no, no, it's because
he's sexually harassing people.

171
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,612
Look, a journalist went
undercover for an interview

172
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,865
and recorded him. Here, watch.

173
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,992
<i>Here's the thing, sweetheart.</i>

174
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,035
<i>You're very qualified,</i>
<i>but you're also what we call</i>

175
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,121
<i>in the coffee shop game a, uh, dog-face.</i>

176
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,582
<i>You're a three, and you have</i>
<i>to be a nine to work here.</i>

177
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,041
{\an8}<i>It's just math.</i>

178
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,669
{\an8}-[woman] <i>So, I didn't get the job?</i>
-[chuckles]

179
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,422
{\an8}<i>No, dog-face, you didn't get the job.</i>

180
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,341
{\an8}<i>All right, I'll check your references.</i>

181
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,178
{\an8}<i>-Just to be nice--</i>
-[woman] <i>Hey, my breasts!</i>

182
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,472
{\an8}<i>I'll check 'em. Oh, they're good. Honk!</i>

183
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,515
I mean, this guy's a monster,
we can't support this guy.

184
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,392
Okay, hey, you're not better than me

185
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,103
just 'cause you won't support
a guy who grabbed a boob once.

186
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,731
No, I'm just saying we shouldn't go there.

187
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,357
We can get coffee somewhere else.

188
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,609
{\an8}<i>Did you know your left reference</i>

189
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,486
{\an8}<i>is a little bit bigger</i>
<i>than your right reference?</i>

190
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,197
{\an8}<i>It's not a bad thing,</i>
<i>it's just... It's a thing. </i>[chuckles]

191
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,200
This is the perfect hobby for you, Chidi.

192
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,451
Cartography.

193
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,245
Your neighborhood stretches way beyond
what you've already seen.

194
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,956
And you can map it,

195
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,460
revealing all of the mysteries,
like an explorer.

196
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,879
-I see how that might be fun.
-[chuckles]

197
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,340
Uh, but, uh, exploring makes me nervous.

198
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,218
I have what doctors call,
"directional insanity."

199
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:34,096
I once got lost on an escalator.
So, not exactly Christopher Columbus.

200
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,390
Fun fact, Columbus is in The Bad Place

201
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,310
because of all the raping,
slave trade, and genocide.

202
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,898
The fact that it makes you nervous
is exactly why you should do it.

203
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,484
You know, get out of your comfort zone.
Become a trail-blazer.

204
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:50,321
Fun fact, all deceased members
of the Portland Trail Blazers

205
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,698
basketball team are also in The Bad Place.

206
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,034
-[giggles]
-Uh, yeah, sorry about this.

207
00:08:55,117 --> 00:09:00,248
I steered her away from colloquialisms
and into "fun facts" and "trivia tidbits."

208
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,083
I thought it'd be more in her wheelhouse.

209
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,794
Fun fact, a "wheelhouse"
is a part of a boat.

210
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,295
Okay, thank you, Janet, thank you.

211
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,880
Fun fact, Janet is me.

212
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,759
All right, let's forget about exploring.
Plenty more ideas for hobbies.

213
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,512
-Let's walk back to town, shall we?
-Okay.

214
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,347
[Chidi grunts]

215
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,766
-Wrong way.
-[Chidi] Yep.

216
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,103
Well, Glenn, we just wanted to
make sure you were all right.

217
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,522
-Tahani, you're too sweet.
-Oh.

218
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,066
-Isn't she just the nicest person?
-Mmm-hmm.

219
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,068
That is what a lot of people are saying.

220
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,486
Oh, everyone I know is saying that.

221
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,697
Yeah, it's just a big neighborhood,

222
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,074
full of enormous mansions
and people who love Tahani!

223
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,450
[both laughing]

224
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,080
Eleanor and I just want to see
if there's anything we can do to help you.

225
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,915
Oh, Tahani, you are so thoughtful.

226
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,460
Despite all the chaos earlier,
we simply couldn't be happier.

227
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,006
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Cualli.
Please take a maple butter scone.

228
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,299
I made them fresh this morning.

229
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,759
Oh, they look a bit burned.

230
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:00,016
But they're not.
Hmm. Oh, fork, that's good.

231
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,184
Extra, extra!

232
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,729
Read all about you.

233
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,399
Chidi, this is the perfect hobby
for you. Journalism.

234
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,152
Well, obviously, I like to write.

235
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,489
But I don't love deadlines.
I prefer to take my time with things.

236
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,993
Yes, I know. Uh, you never even
named your dog, did you?

237
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,621
When it ran away, you posted signs saying,

238
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,831
"Responds to long pauses."

239
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,418
Look, Chidi, I'm just trying to
find you a hobby--

240
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,546
The hat--
That will bring you a positive experience.

241
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,131
What do you say?

242
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,302
I'm loving that hat on you.
It would look even better on my floor.

243
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,054
What is happening now?

244
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,057
I suggested she be friendlier,
she seems to have

245
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,933
slipped right into overt sexuality.

246
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,727
I got something you can slip into.

247
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,979
-Oh--
-Janet, no!

248
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,230
No, Janet.

249
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,526
Oh, Jianyu, darling,
would you like some tea?

250
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,364
That nod meant no, apparently.

251
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,241
Well, it was nice to get out and meet
all of our wonderful neighbors.

252
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,078
They all truly belong here.

253
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,122
Oh, yes, they do, cutie-pants. Boop!

254
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,874
Well, I should really be going.
I have to begin

255
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:11,045
my 12 step Korean skincare regiment,
but, uh, I'll see-- Oh, no, no, no.

256
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,382
Please stay and enjoy the evening tea.
I'll see you soon.

257
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,550
Boop!

258
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,192
<i>"The Diary of Tahani Al-Jamil."</i>

259
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,279
Okay. Arc welding.

260
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,698
You could learn sculpture,
you can make furniture,

261
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,575
you can get your hands
a little greasy, you know,

262
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,785
and you make things.

263
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,954
This equipment is very scary!

264
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,331
Don't be a baby. It can't hurt you.

265
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,667
Watch, I'll blowtorch your face off.

266
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,252
-Janet.
-Whatever.

267
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,087
This whole thing is stupid.

268
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,296
Oh, brother.

269
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,006
-I told her to be less flirty...
-[metal clanking]

270
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,343
And now she's cruel
and distant, apparently.

271
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,761
I just can't get this right.

272
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,139
Thank you for trying to find
me a new hobby.

273
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,392
Um, but I just want to be an academic.

274
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,602
I want to keep working on my manuscript.

275
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,856
Chidi, here's the thing.

276
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,901
See, I read your whole book,
all 3,600 pages of it.

277
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,696
It's, um... How shall I put this?

278
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,364
It's a mess, dude.

279
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,241
Hey!

280
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,159
She's right.

281
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,744
You see, Chidi, I can read the entirety

282
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,913
of the world's literature
in about an hour.

283
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,916
This took me two weeks to get through.

284
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,544
I mean, it's so convoluted,
I just kept reading

285
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,421
the same paragraph over and over again,

286
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,715
trying to figure out
what the heck you were saying.

287
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,759
-Oh, no.
-I mean, on page 1,000,

288
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,554
you start section two with the sentence,

289
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,432
"Of course, the exact opposite
might be true."

290
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,101
You're a brilliant guy, Chidi.

291
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,813
But you just kept revising and rewriting

292
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,565
and adding words to your title.

293
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,109
I think you just twisted
yourself up into a knot.

294
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,944
I have a very bad stomachache.

295
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,572
[Eleanor] Hey, man.

296
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,032
[door closes]

297
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,783
What's wrong?

298
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,288
Am I a good teacher?
Am I clear? Do I make sense?

299
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,333
Yeah, you're a great teacher.
I'm super ethical now.

300
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,293
-What's that?
-Hmm?

301
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,170
Nah, don't worry about it.

302
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,506
[sighs]

303
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,382
I stole Tahani's diary.

304
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,968
So I could see if her handwriting
matches the note

305
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,013
and also read about all the mean
and terrible things

306
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,266
she's definitely done,
so I can prove she's actually evil.

307
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,605
Huh.

308
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,899
What do you think that means?

309
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,488
You stole Tahani's diary.

310
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,032
I know I broke some ethical rule,
but I had good reason.

311
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:49,245
Eleanor, in order to be a good person,
you have to do good things.

312
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,624
And not stealing people's stuff,
that is just a basic kindergarten rule.

313
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,169
I mean, do I also have to
tell you to not throw sand?

314
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,505
First of all, throwing sand is
an excellent way to put out a vodka fire.

315
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,839
Why would you even know that?

316
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,092
Second of all,
I know that it may not be nice,

317
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,221
but neither is pretending to be
100% perfect, like Tahani does.

318
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,015
-She wrote that note.
-No, she didn't!

319
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,892
You did!

320
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,271
I was hoping you would come
to this conclusion on your own,

321
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:20,109
but, obviously, no one here
would ever threaten you.

322
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,779
That note is The Good Place
manifesting your own guilt.

323
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,240
Like with the plant,
or when you literally made

324
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,493
giant shrimp fly through the air.

325
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,955
I wrote myself the note.

326
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,000
And as it turns out, I do belong here.

327
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,918
Because I'm just as good as everyone else.

328
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,171
No, no, no. No, you don't belong here.

329
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,008
And in this place,
everyone is better than you.

330
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,011
It has been proven
by an infallible formula.

331
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:51,599
Tahani might be a little British
and condescending at times,

332
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,269
but she devoted her entire life
to helping other people.

333
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,147
She's a good person. Accept that.

334
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,650
Hey, babe.

335
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,612
Great news.
I got us tickets to the Coyotes game.

336
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,323
-Awesome!
-But, ooh, yikes.

337
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,450
Turns out two of the players have DUIs.

338
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,785
Guess we can't cheer for that team.

339
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,579
-Eleanor, I--
-You know what?

340
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,706
Instead, let's just stay in,

341
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,584
watch a Roman Polanski movie,
listen to R. Kelly,

342
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,128
and eat Chik-fil-A. Does that sound good?

343
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,672
There's bad stuff everywhere, man.

344
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,633
It's impossible to avoid.

345
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,760
Yeah, but shouldn't we just try?

346
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,304
Shouldn't we just try to do the
right thing whenever we can?

347
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,181
Why? It's so much harder
to live like that.

348
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,766
And it's not like someone's keeping score.

349
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,184
[sighs]

350
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,769
Look, I know you're gonna
break up with me, okay?

351
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,229
I'm not an idiot.
I read your emails to your dad.

352
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,107
Have fun being so amazing
and perfect until you die.

353
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,902
And by the way, I'm talking really fast
because I still go to Andy's Coffee,

354
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,820
and I got a full punch card, bro.

355
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,913
Good people make me insecure.

356
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,582
When I'm around someone
who I think is better than me,

357
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,292
I try and drag them down to my level.

358
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,171
That's why perfect Tahani
is like my kryptonite.

359
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:08,092
Well, even admitting that
is an important step.

360
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,885
And also, maybe don't listen to me.

361
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,721
I would love not to listen to you.
Wait, what?

362
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:18,602
Basically, my life's work
is 3,600 pages of garbage.

363
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,646
Even Michael couldn't understand it.

364
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,730
So?

365
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,691
-What does Michael know?
-Everything.

366
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,277
That's my point, he knows everything,
and it was too convoluted, even for him.

367
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,738
Michael does not know everything.

368
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,075
Michael does not know
I'm not supposed to be here.

369
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:38,205
You wrote 4,000 pages on one of the most
complicated subjects in the world.

370
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,874
I mean, I used to get bored
halfway through writing a text message.

371
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,584
Be proud.

372
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,258
[Chidi]<i> I want to broaden my horizons</i>

373
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,301
and try new things, and I will.

374
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,762
But even though I might have
gotten lost in the weeds,

375
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:58,350
I loved writing this book.
And I want to try again.

376
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,478
So, will you be my advisor?

377
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,190
Chidi, all I want is for you to be happy.

378
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,861
So if spending eternity
getting blunt feedback

379
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,614
on your circular, rambling ideas
will make you happy,

380
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,075
then of course I will be your advisor.

381
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:19,038
Let's throw that monstrosity
in the trash and start over.

382
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,541
Aren't there maybe
some parts worth salvaging?

383
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,502
Honestly, man, I don't even know.
I mean, that thing is unreadable.

384
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,214
I literally learned what headaches were
because that thing gave me a headache.

385
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,799
[clicks tongue] Okay.

386
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,012
There you go. New beginnings! Well done.

387
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,224
[Tahani crying]

388
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,148
Oh!

389
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,400
Oh, hello, Eleanor. Hi.

390
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,818
Sorry, I was just cleaning up.

391
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,820
Are you okay?

392
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,449
Do you want to talk about it?

393
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,575
Desperately.

394
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,203
It's Jianyu.

395
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,913
I just can't seem to connect with him.

396
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,790
I know that he took a vow of silence,

397
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:06,251
but he won't even talk to me,
his soul mate!

398
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,713
-And I adore talking.
-I know. You do.

399
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,174
Eleanor, you don't know
what it's like to be in paradise

400
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,718
and feel like there's something
just not quite right.

401
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,845
Well...

402
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,890
I may not know exactly
what you're feeling,

403
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,433
but I do understand.

404
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,978
And you deserve to be happy, because...

405
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,358
You are an impressive, thoughtful,
and special person.

406
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,570
Not to mention...

407
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,697
You have a rockin' bod.

408
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,824
[chuckles]

409
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,119
I mean, Jianyu may be mute,
but he's not blind.

410
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,288
-[laughs]
-You two belong here.

411
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,207
And you belong together.

412
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,417
And you have all of eternity,

413
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,711
so there's plenty of time
for things to change.

414
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,338
Oh, thank you.

415
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,424
I really needed to hear that. Come here.

416
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,470
Ugh, of course your hugs are amazing.

417
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,308
[yawns]

418
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,269
[yelps]

419
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,105
Stupid ledge. No stairs.

420
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,026
Everyone here is really into hugging.

421
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,572
Looks like someone learned something.

422
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:24,121
Well, it's 'cause someone else
is a really good teacher.

423
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,211
Eleanor, hello.
How are you, my dear, sweet bestie?

424
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,547
-[chuckles]
-Never better. What's up?

425
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,924
Well, Janet has been
acting as my assistant.

426
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,886
It's not what she was designed to do.

427
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,638
-Didn't go great.
-But now I'm back to normal.

428
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,515
It turns out that the best Janet

429
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,518
was the Janet that was
inside Janet all along.

430
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,687
She was feeling a little lost,
so I gave her

431
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,857
a self-help book
to restore her confidence.

432
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,735
Now I'm living my truth
and creating my bliss.

433
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,656
Anyway, um, look, Michael asked me
if I would serve as his assistant,

434
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,868
but I'd quite like to focus
on my relationship with Jianyu.

435
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:07,122
So I recommended
you for the job. [giggles]

436
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,376
Eleanor, you and I could work
side-by-side to figure out

437
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,337
what's going wrong with this neighborhood.

438
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,671
Will you help me?

439
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,716
-How could I say no?
-Yeah, hurrah!

440
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,468
-Hurrah!
-[laughs]

441
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,261
[sighing]

442
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,473
What now?

443
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,605
{\an8}[sighs]

444
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,233
{\an8}Relax, Eleanor.

445
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,027
{\an8}[nervous chuckle]
You sent this to yourself.

446
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,114
{\an8}This is your own guilt manifesting itself.

447
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,618
{\an8}I've been waiting for you.

448
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,496
{\an8}Jianyu? You talk now?

449
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,710
{\an8}You sent me these threatening notes?
What the fork, man?

450
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,170
{\an8}Some Buddhist monk you are.

451
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,923
{\an8}You don't belong here. Admit it.

452
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,844
{\an8}Okay, you're right. I don't belong here.

453
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,097
Michael made a mistake.
But I'm trying, dude.

454
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,432
I'm really trying to be a good person.

455
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:12,354
And I think I'm changing for the better,
so just please, please don't rat me out.

456
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,024
-Don't worry, I won't.
-[sighs]

457
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,068
Because I'm not
supposed to be here, either.

458
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,654
I don't know how I got here,
I have no idea what's going on,

459
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,239
and I am freakin' out, homie!

460
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,075
You got to help me. I'm scared!

461
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,995
What?
