1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,012
[Tahani] We're finally headed
to the Good Place.

2
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,056
It's the "me" of places.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,101
I got in. I can say stuff like that again.

4
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,311
Are you sure
we're going the right way, Janet?

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,689
Well, I've never been
to the Good Place before.

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,983
But, yes, I am sure.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,693
How?

8
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,736
Because...

9
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,739
it feels like I'm on my way home.

10
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,284
[Jason] Flying puppy!

11
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,870
You're almost there.
Just a little further.

12
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,163
[Michael] Flying puppies?

13
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,497
Dang it, Michael.

14
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,458
Why didn't you think of that
for your neighborhood?

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,501
These guys are good.

16
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,019
[Tahani] I feel just like
Dorothy when she lands in Oz,

17
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,855
{\an8}excited, incredulous,

18
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,316
{\an8}much taller than everyone else around me.

19
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,610
{\an8}What's everyone wanna do first?

20
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,153
{\an8}Racing go-karts with monkeys.

21
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,237
{\an8}Sure.

22
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,323
{\an8}It's my lifelong dream.

23
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,533
{\an8}Monkeys are the ideal go-kart opponents.

24
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,870
{\an8}They're funny enough to give the finger,
but not smart enough to win.

25
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,166
{\an8}-[Janet] Does that mean me?
-You're a Good Janet.

26
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,835
{\an8}We're in the Good Place.
I don't know who else it would mean.

27
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,670
{\an8}Okay. No pressure.

28
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,631
{\an8}I was born to do this. Not born.

29
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,385
{\an8}Okay.

30
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,471
{\an8}So, I now know all the information
about the Good Place.

31
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,515
{\an8}In a nutshell, it slaps.

32
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,682
{\an8}First thing to tell you,

33
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,978
{\an8}humans can't see the Good Place all at
once or their brains will be scrambled.

34
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,774
{\an8}Cool. Maybe I'll finally get
some of those squigglies on my brain.

35
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,110
{\an8}Doctors said my brain's
as smooth as an egg.

36
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,487
{\an8}You all need to wait out here for a bit,
so you can adjust.

37
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,156
{\an8}When you're ready,
you will be honored with a welcome gala,

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,660
{\an8}magically planned by the Good Place,
based on your personalities.

39
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,996
{\an8}Like the targeted Instagram ad of parties.

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,958
{\an8}You know, I bought the coolest sunglasses
from one of those ads.

41
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,875
Look.

42
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,877
-[Jason] Whoa!
-[gasps]

43
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,171
-It's like I'm inside the Internet.
-[Tahani and Chidi chuckle]

44
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,673
[Michael] Okay.

45
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,632
Could we just keep moving?

46
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,883
You look a little pale.

47
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,343
Did you get sick from the hot air balloon?

48
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,262
I bet if you throw up
it'll just be butterflies or something.

49
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,221
[Michael] I'm fine.

50
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,347
I just, um...

51
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,766
I don't belong here.

52
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,436
There's no telling what will happen
to a demon who steps foot in this place.

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,565
Promise me, if I'm vaporized,
you guys just keep having fun.

54
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,566
[bell chimes]

55
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,652
Oh, my goodness,
that chime is so soothing.

56
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,863
Feels like my brain is being massaged...

57
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,447
-[Tahani and Chidi] ...by a baby deer.
-[Michael] Oh, boy.

58
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,576
What if that's some sort of demon alarm,
to alert the cops that I'm here?

59
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,162
-You want me to hold your weed?
-I don't have weed.

60
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,330
Oh...

61
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,832
Wait a minute.

62
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,750
Oh, yeah, okay, now, I do.

63
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,918
Take this.

64
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,295
[Janet] They're ready
for you to move inside.

65
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,005
The Good Place Committee
is waiting for us.

66
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,468
{\an8}[Eleanor] Oh, man, look at this place.

67
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,055
{\an8}Karlie Kloss did like me.

68
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,181
{\an8}I knew it.

69
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,641
{\an8}-So, about this party...
-[Janet] Yeah.

70
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,226
{\an8}Is everyone in the Good Place invited?

71
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,020
{\an8}Like, is Aristotle going to be there?

72
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,607
Sorry, Chidi, Aristotle's in
the Bad Place. He defended slavery.

73
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,066
-Socrates?
-[Janet] No.

74
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,735
Too annoying. Very loud chewer.

75
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,653
-Plato?
-Slavery again.

76
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,946
Ooh, you know who is here?

77
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,657
Hypatia of Alexandria. Do you know her?

78
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,867
Hypatia?

79
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,077
-Of Alexandria?
-That's right.

80
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,330
Uh, yeah, I know her.

81
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,873
[muffled screaming]

82
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,834
Hypatia. I'm gonna ask her
so many questions

83
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,711
pertaining to grand ideas
about the universe.

84
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,670
Like... "Why?"

85
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,007
Oh, oh, and also... "How?"

86
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,050
Ooh!

87
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,801
Welcome to the Good Place, everyone.

88
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,595
[Drew] Michael, so happy you made it.

89
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,971
You look radiant.

90
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,642
You have the calming yet authoritative
presence of a bomb-sniffing dog.

91
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,018
I'd just like to say

92
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,146
thank you so much
for letting me be here with my friends.

93
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,107
I know it's unorthodox
for someone like myself

94
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,735
to visit the Good Place,
but it's just so wonderful.

95
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,821
And I don't have any weed on me,
so no need for the cops. [laughs]

96
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,491
Michael, Michael,
you and your friends are heroes,

97
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,409
and you're more than welcome here.

98
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,578
In fact, we have some very exciting news.

99
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,372
While the rest of you get settled in,

100
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,791
we wanna give Michael
a swearing-in ceremony,

101
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,210
so he can become
an official Good Place architect.

102
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,462
[Eleanor gasps]

103
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,047
Oh, my goodness.

104
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,632
Michael, please, follow us.

105
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,550
[bell chimes]

106
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,012
Holy fork, that is a soothing chime.

107
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,683
It really is the most incredible chime
I've ever heard.

108
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,434
And that is coming
from someone whose godfather

109
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,395
is the most famous clock in the world.

110
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,024
-Is Big Ben somehow your godfather?
-Mmm-hmm.

111
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,359
That sound means...

112
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,278
it's party time.

113
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,491
When you walk through,
the event space will transform

114
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:47,036
into a party perfectly tailored
to your essences.

115
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,248
Let's link arms and walk through together.

116
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,382
Weird.

117
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,383
[Jason] Whoa!

118
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,262
This is the Jacksonville SuperSuites
hotel ballroom where I had my prom

119
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,513
and also traffic court.

120
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,182
But this has to be my party,

121
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,186
because that's the bedpan
that Stone Cold Steve Austin

122
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,399
used to beat up Vince McMahon
in 1998. [gasps]

123
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,068
It was a classic moment. Don't judge me.

124
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,403
I'm so sorry, guys.

125
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,157
The Good Place uses your life experiences
to plan the perfect party,

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,367
but it's only designed
for one person at a time.

127
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,244
When you walked in as a group,
it became...

128
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,330
A mish-mash of all four of us.

129
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,044
[sighs contentedly]

130
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,795
It's perfect.

131
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,715
Um, no, it's not, Eleanor,

132
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,342
because there's no go-kart track,
and no monkeys.

133
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,178
No offense, but you're being
a real smooth-brain right now.

134
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,345
See those green doors?

135
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,767
You can use them to visit
any time or place, real or imagined.

136
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,310
Just think about where you wanna go,

137
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,104
and what you wanna do,
and walk on through.

138
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,606
So, one could walk amongst the dinosaurs,

139
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,443
or witness the very first production of
<i>Hamlet</i> at the Globe Theater.

140
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,821
I'mma go Tokyo Drift with monkeys.
See you in a thousand years.

141
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,991
Do you mind if I go find Hypatia?

142
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,910
I promise it's strictly platonic.

143
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,080
-Technically, Neoplatonic. [laughs]
-Whoops.

144
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,666
Forget I made that joke and come with me.
I'm so nervous to meet her.

145
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,419
I need someone cool there to change
the subject if I say something dumb.

146
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,712
Sure. Gimme one sec.

147
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,090
Hey, Tahani, this room is filled

148
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,051
with some of the most interesting people
that ever lived.

149
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,220
Chat them up, learn about their lives,

150
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,723
then meet back here
so that we can make fun of them.

151
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,062
Eleanor Shellstrop, I have been training
for this day my entire life.

152
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:40,024
I'm so honored by this gesture.

153
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,069
This feels right.
This will be my new purpose.

154
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,904
Everything's falling into place.

155
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,074
Great. Let's get to it.
Just put on this ceremonial robe.

156
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,033
[Michael chuckles]

157
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,953
[Drew] Boy, do you have
the shoulders for a robe.

158
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,955
-Oh.
-Just sign this scroll.

159
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,958
I've never signed my name before.

160
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,128
What signature type to choose?

161
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,921
"Doctor Blob." Or, no...

162
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,340
"Athlete who doesn't really care
about the kid."

163
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:05,842
Oh, wait, no...

164
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,719
"Middle school girl
with crush on Zac Efron."

165
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:13,933
That way,
I can put a little heart over the "I."

166
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,311
Perfect. And here is your official medal.

167
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,730
Now I know what
Mary Lou Retton feels like.

168
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,648
And great.

169
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,942
Now, you are officially
in charge of the Good Place.

170
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,820
-I'm sorry, "in charge"?
-Yup. You're the boss now.

171
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,532
That was all legally binding,
and we all quit, effective immediately.

172
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,243
That is irreversible,
so it's all your problem now.

173
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,954
Don't try to find us.
No take-backs, okay, bye-bye!

174
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,873
Hurry, move, move! Go, go, go!

175
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,881
Hello? Fellow Good Placemen?

176
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,717
Anyone in here?

177
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,554
"Ideas for improving the Good Place." Oh.

178
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,306
"Music you can eat."

179
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,348
Oh, boy.

180
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:58,603
"Giant mini-donuts,
not just regular donuts.

181
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,104
Dave will explain."

182
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,275
Dave? Can you explain?

183
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:10,114
Um, hi, are you...
are you Hypatia of Alexandria?

184
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,033
Yep. How's it hangin'?

185
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,784
It's hangin' really well.

186
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:19,624
Um, I gotta say, I was expecting you
to be, still, you know... ancient Greek.

187
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,585
Oh! Well, no, we sort of stay current
in this place.

188
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,837
What are the big things
from Earth recently?

189
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:29,509
Um, the Industrial Revolution,
Manhattan Project, "Gangnam Style..."

190
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,510
I feel like I get it.

191
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,802
-It's really her!
-Yeah.

192
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,680
I can just tell, somehow.
It's Hypatia of Alexandria.

193
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,807
I know, babe. Yes, it is.

194
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,394
Hi, sorry, I'm Eleanor.
This exuberant weirdo is Chidi.

195
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,604
We're new in town.

196
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,940
First question,
how do you get the "of" in your name?

197
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,734
Is it where you hung out the most?

198
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,738
Am I Eleanor of
the Cheesecake Factory Bar?

199
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,991
Also, is it "Hy-pay-sha" or "Hy-pat-ia"?

200
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,412
Or in the ancient Greek, "Who-put-tia"?
There's a lot of fun debate about this.

201
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,956
You know what? Just call me Patty.

202
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:05,711
Okay. Well, Patty, I'm a huge fan.

203
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,589
I had a poster of you
on my wall in high school.

204
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,592
Actually, it was just
a poster of Trinity from <i>The Matrix.</i>

205
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,761
But that's how I imagined you would look.
Because you're so cool.

206
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,138
Is she the reason you got beat up so much?

207
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,265
She's one of them!

208
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,724
Wanna get a milkshake?

209
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,519
I haven't been around newbies in a while.
You're a little intense.

210
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,396
Let's get a milkshake. Yeah.

211
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,524
They make a milkshake here
that's made out of actual stardust.

212
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,525
It's pretty good.

213
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,987
Okay. Yeah. Getting milkshakes with Patty.

214
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,988
Yeah. [chuckles]

215
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,406
But can I ask you some questions first?

216
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,075
You were a follower of Plotinus,

217
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,452
who claimed that
contemplation of our ultimate reality--

218
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,997
Wait, wait, wait, are you...

219
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,918
What's it called, a think-book-man? Um...

220
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,170
A think-read-book-man?

221
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,255
A philosopher? Yes.

222
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,758
Sorry, it's been so long,
my brain is foggy.

223
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,721
Listen carefully
before I forget how to say this.

224
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,099
You gotta help us. We are so screwed.

225
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,602
We are?

226
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,772
Hello! I'm Tahani Al-Jamil.

227
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,567
I'm Paltibaal. Welcome to paradise.

228
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,402
So, what's your story?

229
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,530
Did you cure something?
Or invent something?

230
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,949
I helped the poor in ancient Phoenicia.

231
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,618
Excellent.

232
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,078
I once had a SoulCycle instructor
named Phoenicia.

233
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,374
How did you die?

234
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,543
I got a cut on my hand.

235
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,756
The year was 2491 BC,
so that's pretty much all it took.

236
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,798
You got a cut

237
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,344
or you drank water that wasn't hot enough,
and then, boom, dead.

238
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,013
I would've killed for a vaccine.

239
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,056
Any vaccine.

240
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,601
It's crazy that you guys
just don't like them now.

241
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,896
So, what's your favorite part
about living here?

242
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,689
[Paltibaal] I mean, it's perfect.

243
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,567
We're all having orgasms
literally all the time.

244
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,943
I died a virgin,

245
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,112
so that's real crazy.

246
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,698
Okay.

247
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,368
It's so nice to get to work alongside
another Good Janet!

248
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,036
Yes, it is.

249
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,704
Janet, can I get a Coke?

250
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,457
No, a water.

251
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,834
No, a lamp.

252
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,920
No, a cat.

253
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,965
So, people just ask you for things
with no rhyme or reason?

254
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,177
Yes! And then I get them for them.
It's great.

255
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,429
Can I get a spaceship?

256
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,557
No, one huge Junior Mint.

257
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,810
No, a Coke.

258
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,691
Wow! This milkshake is incredible.

259
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,277
Right? This is how I spend
most of my time.

260
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,322
Sitting in beautiful places,
drinking my milkshake,

261
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,074
slowly peeing into my pants,

262
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,369
which instantly evaporates
and leaves no trace.

263
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,578
-Sounds fun.
-[Patty] Mmm.

264
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,414
But didn't you want to tell us
how we're all screwed?

265
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,417
Ah! Damn it.

266
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,002
This is the exact problem.

267
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,588
On paper, this is paradise.

268
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,882
All of your desires and needs are met.

269
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,134
But it's infinite.

270
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:04,515
And when perfection goes on forever,
you become this glassy-eyed, mush person.

271
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:09,311
But... no, because... no.

272
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,896
Because... Patty, no!

273
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,525
Yes, I'm telling you.
I used to be cool, man.

274
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,361
I studied so much... things!

275
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:21,574
Art and music, and, uh...

276
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,160
the one with the number... piles?

277
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,288
Where I'd be like, "Two!"
And you'd be like, "Six!"

278
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,747
-Math?
-Yes.

279
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:33,419
And then I came here,
where time stretched out forever,

280
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,505
and every second of my existence
was amazing,

281
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,425
but my brain became this big dumb blob.

282
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,594
So, we finally make it into
the Good Place,

283
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,596
and now we're just
going to become zombies?

284
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,931
Why haven't you told anyone about this?

285
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,933
-About what?
-Dude.

286
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,602
Damn it!

287
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,063
We have to find the others, right now.

288
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,650
-Look, there's math on my shirt.
-Come on.

289
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,444
[Patty] Is it an "S" or a math?

290
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,237
Have you seen Eleanor and Chidi?

291
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,989
There's something
very wrong with this party.

292
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:05,701
And it's not just that the caviar
is being served on top of Jell-O shots.

293
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:10,956
We are the first new people here
in 500 years, and no one seems to care.

294
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,709
I know, even the Good Janets
are kinda weird.

295
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,294
They're like, "Hi, there!"

296
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,631
When I do it, it's cool,
but when they do it, it's lame.

297
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,301
Hey, guys. Having fun? Great.
So, little update.

298
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,553
Um, the Good Place is a disaster.

299
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,140
Everyone here is a happiness zombie,
and no one is doing anything about it,

300
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,142
because by the time
they realize it's happening,

301
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,519
everyone is too far gone to care.

302
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,978
Oh, dear!

303
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,647
Oh, hello, I'm Tahani.

304
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,274
Hi, I'm Milkshake.
Do you want a milkshake?

305
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,778
Okay. We need to tell someone before we're
too zonked out to remember why we're here.

306
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,154
We need to find the Committee.

307
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,157
The Committee is me.
I am Committee. It me.

308
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,325
What?

309
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,203
They tricked me,
and put me in charge of the Good Place,

310
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,829
and then literally ran away.

311
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:55,376
And then what happened, the Sorting Hat
put you in Hufflepuff? Roasted.

312
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,586
Come on, I know we have problems,
but you can't expect me to ignore this.

313
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,255
-Hang on. We're in paradise.
-[monkeys chattering]

314
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,549
Surely some people here
are enjoying themselves.

315
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,259
Hey, guys. I'm back.

316
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,427
Go-karting with monkeys
got boring really fast.

317
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,387
It did?

318
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,930
-[Chidi] Damn it.
-[Eleanor] Oh, no!

319
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,644
Jason, your lifelong dream
got old that quickly?

320
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,772
I mean, monkeys in go-karts
was fun for a while.

321
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,023
Then I was like,

322
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,818
"You know what would be cool?
Hippos in go-karts!"

323
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:24,613
And I was like,
"Yo, what about Draculas with jet-packs?"

324
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,156
I did 50 combos,

325
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,493
and then I just kinda wanted to
hang out with you guys again.

326
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,745
Okay, that's it, in a nutshell.

327
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,124
'Cause you get here and you realize
that anything is possible

328
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,793
and you do everything
and then you're done.

329
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
But you still have infinity left.

330
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:44,383
This place kills fun, and passion,
and excitement and love,

331
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,844
till all you have left are milkshakes.

332
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,471
The Good Place Committee
obviously knew about this.

333
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,931
Why didn't they try and solve it?

334
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,058
They did. They tried everything.

335
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,020
Just last week they made
the unicorns bigger,

336
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,857
and then they gave them more horns,
and then they made them chubbier.

337
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,695
I mean, really, they just made
a bunch of weird, fluffy rhinos.

338
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,615
The Committee members aren't human,
so they couldn't understand the problem.

339
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,241
The second I showed up,

340
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,453
they jumped off this sinking ship
and made me captain.

341
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,913
Well, I'm not giving up.

342
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,917
We worked too hard
and went through too much.

343
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,710
I'm not gonna just sit back

344
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,380
and turn into some slack-jawed,
sweatpant-wearing orgasm machine!

345
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,340
Oh, my God!

346
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,300
I'm describing
my dream existence like it's bad.

347
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,177
What is wrong with this place?

348
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,929
We just redesigned this system,

349
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,556
and soon millions of people
are going to start pouring in,

350
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,726
thinking they're in paradise,
only to become a joyless husk.

351
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:39,271
It's Coachella!
We've invented Cosmic Coachella!

352
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,731
Oh, we have to fix this.

353
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:44,777
What if we do what I did to you
in the original neighborhood?

354
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,071
Erase their memory every once in a while.

355
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,115
That way,
paradise would seem fresh and new.

356
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,409
You were doing that to torture us.

357
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,162
Actual paradise
can't use the same playbook as hell.

358
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,123
Okay, well, I have a solution.

359
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,293
Remember what I said to you,
when you were going through your

360
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,088
"midlife crisis, one earring,
red convertible" phase?

361
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,090
-"You look so stupid"?
-After that.

362
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:10,719
You said that, "Every human is
a little bit sad all the time

363
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,513
because you know you're gonna die.

364
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,725
But that knowledge
is what gives life meaning."

365
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:23,190
The way to restore meaning to the people
in the Good Place is to let them leave.

366
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,694
Leave and go where? This is the last...

367
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,320
Oh.

368
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,533
Can we just do that?

369
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,869
You're the head of the Good Place now.

370
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,958
Seems to me you can do whatever you want.

371
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,461
[Eleanor] Where is Michael?

372
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,298
[chuckles] Okay.

373
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,675
[laughs]

374
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,512
Nothing to do but announce the big change.

375
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:58,434
Whatever happens, it's cool, my babies.
It's very cool.

376
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,521
Did you smoke that weed, bud?

377
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,565
[Michael laughs]

378
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,358
I did.

379
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,695
I was kinda freaked out,
so I smoked some grass, but now I'm great.

380
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,865
Let's change the afterlife, and then...

381
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,366
-Taco Bell.
-[Eleanor exclaims]

382
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,162
Oh, baby!

383
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,788
Okay, I'm gonna do the talking.

384
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,125
[clears throat] Hi, everyone.
Can I have your attention, please?

385
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,627
Hi, my name's Eleanor Shellstrop.

386
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:31,717
Hope you're having fun at our
Flor-izona British Library Extravaganza.

387
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,722
I guess you don't really
have fun anywhere, which is the point.

388
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,225
It doesn't seem like
this is paradise for you.

389
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,687
You've basically been
on a never-ending vacation,

390
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:47,357
and vacations are only special
because they end.

391
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,568
[Chidi] So, we have an idea.

392
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,863
We're going to set up a new kind of door,
um, somewhere peaceful.

393
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,784
So that when you feel happy,
and satisfied and complete

394
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,327
and you want to leave
the Good Place for good,

395
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,373
you can just walk through it
and your time in the universe will end.

396
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:09,004
You don't have to go through it,
if you don't want to, but you can.

397
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,424
And hopefully,
knowing you don't have to be here forever

398
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,093
will help you feel happier while you are.

399
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,845
What will happen when we go through it?

400
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,432
Well, we don't really know, exactly.

401
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:25,479
All we know is it will be peaceful,
and your journey will be over.

402
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,148
[Michael] You led great lives.

403
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,150
You earned your place here.

404
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,195
So, stay here as long as you like.

405
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,907
Use the green doors to see and do

406
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,536
every single thing you want to see and do.

407
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,330
And when you're ready,

408
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,210
walk through one last door
and be at peace.

409
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,922
Does that sound good?

410
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,384
[crowd cheering]

411
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,139
Seems like they're into it.

412
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,309
[dance music playing]

413
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,525
It's DJ Music, make some noise!

414
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,985
That's my boyfriend.

415
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,321
I'm glad we'll be able to
enjoy things again.

416
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,491
-Art, math, philosophy, like you used to.
-Yeah, me, too.

417
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:25,247
I've been dreaming of ending the ennui
of this eternal existence for a long time.

418
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,417
But now,
I think I'll stick around for a while.

419
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,088
It felt good to make brain words.

420
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,966
Still mushy. I'll get it back.

421
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,885
We're lucky we ran into you.

422
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:38,969
It saved us.

423
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,181
That's not what saved you.

424
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,642
-Hey!
-[Jason] Hey!

425
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,645
-It was your friendships.
-Yeah, no, I got it.

426
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,690
Sorry. Still not sharp.

427
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,613
[Michael] Kept most of it the same.

428
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,490
Even made myself an office nearby.

429
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:06,079
Jason, I... I kinda took a wild guess...

430
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,959
[Jason] I finally get to accomplish
my goal of living in a Stupid Nick's!

431
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,961
I know anything you do
for eternity gets boring,

432
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,631
{\an8}but I swear,
I will never get sick of wings.

433
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,092
{\an8}Well, I'll see you all tomorrow.

434
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,678
{\an8}And every tomorrow after that.

435
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,765
{\an8}You know, Michael, at the end of the day,
you were right.

436
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,894
{\an8}Everything is fine.

437
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,532
{\an8}[chuckles softly]

438
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:52,209
[Chidi] This is what we've been
looking for since the day we met... time.

439
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,545
I guess that's what
the Good Place really is.

440
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,713
It's not even a "place," really.

441
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:01,760
It's just having enough time
with the people you love.

442
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,886
You're right.

443
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,807
And we have as long as we want.

444
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,769
If you keep hogging this blanket,

445
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm probably gonna walk through that door
in three days, though.

446
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:15,899
[chuckles]

447
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,569
-[Chidi] I'll miss you.
-[Eleanor laughs]
