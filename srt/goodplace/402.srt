1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:01,876
{\an8}Linda...

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,879
{\an8}You can have literally
anything you could--

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,339
What the--

4
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:10,176
[Judge] <i>You sent a demon in disguise</i>
<i>as one of the subjects?</i>

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,679
<i>This outrageous act must be punished.</i>

6
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,557
<i>Chidi will be the fourth subject</i>
<i>in this experiment.</i>

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,062
I still don't get why the Bad Place
would try something so obvious?

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,231
They're desperate.
They know they're gonna lose.

9
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,525
Plus, we can get rid of the Linda picture,

10
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:30,238
and put a Chidi picture on the other side
since we know a ton about him.

11
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,906
It's all good news, right, team leader?

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,283
Yeah, it's super cool

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,494
that I'm actively surveilling
and manipulating an ex-boyfriend.

14
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,538
I mean, more so than I usually did.

15
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,373
Okay, let's focus on Brent.

16
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,334
{\an8}Born on third base, thinks he invented
the game of baseball.

17
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,337
{\an8}Guys like this believe
that the world revolves around them,

18
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,131
{\an8}because it kinda does.

19
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,759
If we could get him
to listen to anyone else,

20
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,178
he'd hear how much better they are
than he was,

21
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,139
which might make him realize
that he doesn't belong here,

22
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,682
and also, bonus...

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,685
maybe he cries like a stupid little baby.

24
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,654
{\an8}Anyway, long story short,
that's why there are still ducks.

25
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,615
-I saved all the ducks.
-[audience] Aw!

26
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,034
Incredible. Wow.

27
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,869
Thank you, Wanda. What a life.

28
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,456
{\an8}Now we turn to our next guest,
Chidi Anagonye.

29
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,832
{\an8}[audience applauds]

30
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,919
{\an8}Now, Chidi, you led an impressive life
as an academic.

31
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:30,465
{\an8}Uh, well, uh, not
save-an-entire-species impressive,

32
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:34,427
{\an8}but yes, I was a professor
of ethical and moral philosophy.

33
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,055
{\an8}I'm sorry. Literally every duck?

34
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,432
{\an8}-You saved every duck?
-In essence, yes.

35
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,186
{\an8}And I didn't mention this before,
I really don't like to brag,

36
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,063
{\an8}but also horses.

37
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,231
{\an8}-[audience exclaims]
-What?

38
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:50,276
{\an8}[chuckles] Man. I mean, compared to you,
I feel a little inadequate.

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,444
{\an8}[audience laughs]

40
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,115
{\an8}Hey. Hey, Mikey, can I ask you something?

41
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,576
{\an8}I feel bad for making Janet's life
more chaotic and unpredictable.

42
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,746
{\an8}So, here's my idea to make it up to her.

43
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,542
{\an8}Me and 100 Janet babies
do a giant flash mob,

44
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,294
{\an8}just total unpredictable chaos
all around her.

45
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,380
{\an8}Great idea, right?

46
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,258
{\an8}-Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason.
-Mmm-hmm?

47
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,177
{\an8}Sorry, I put a little cheat code
in the neighborhood,

48
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,555
{\an8}where if I say your name five times,
my headache goes away.

49
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,600
Do you know why I forced you to act
like a monk in the original neighborhood?

50
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,228
-Does it have to do with the TV show <i>Monk?</i>
-No.

51
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,649
It's because you have no control
over your own impulses.

52
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,944
You think every problem can be solved
with a Molotov cocktail,

53
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:36,281
or slashing somebody's tires
or plunging Derek.

54
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,867
So, being a monk was torture for you.

55
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,995
The only way for you
to repair your relationship with Janet

56
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,830
is to give her some space.

57
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,583
Show her that you can
control your impulses.

58
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:52,714
So, you're saying wanting to do something
isn't a good reason to immediately do it?

59
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,550
Yeah.

60
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,844
Man! I wish someone
had taught me this on Earth.

61
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,430
People tried. Mostly judges.

62
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,347
[audience applauding]

63
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,640
Hey, showtime.

64
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,769
And now, Brent Norwalk, why don't you
tell us a little bit about yourself?

65
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,980
Thank you very much. Thank you.

66
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,732
Sure. I'm pretty interesting.

67
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,610
I grew up in Chicago. A suburb, obviously.

68
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,029
I went to Princeton University.

69
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,781
No handouts, by the way.
I earned my spot there.

70
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,117
Just like my father
and his father before him.

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,871
I then inherited the family business,
and in just 18 years,

72
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,124
I grew Norwalk Materials
from a $90 million company...

73
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,002
to a $94 million company.

74
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,003
One second. Hey, Janet?

75
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,755
-Hi, there.
-Perrier.

76
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,593
[Eleanor] Why don't you tell us
about a time when things

77
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,053
-didn't come so easy to you?
-[Brent] Mmm.

78
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,930
Look, I've had my share
of disappointments.

79
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,099
I smartly bought Netflix stock
at $38 a share,

80
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,643
but I couldn't cash it in before I died.

81
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,479
So, all that money's going to my dumb kid.

82
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,147
But you have to press on, right?

83
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,777
In the words of Martin Luther King Jr.,
who I personally believe was a great man,

84
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,905
he said that, "When life knocks you
on your butt,

85
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,949
you jump back up
and start throwing haymakers."

86
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,326
-I'm not sure he said that.
-No, he did. You're wrong.

87
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,497
For me, Eleanor, it's all about
taking personal responsibility.

88
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,123
Not enough people do that.

89
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,541
If you ask me,

90
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,002
-that's what's wrong with this country.
-What country?

91
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,338
This was fun, Eleanor,
but I have a tee time.

92
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,173
Daddy no golfy, daddy get cranky.

93
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,759
So, Chad, Duck Lady, nice to meet ya.

94
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,927
-[audience applauds]
-[Brent] Thank you.

95
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,428
Thank you all very much. You were great.

96
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,430
A car?

97
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,226
He got a car?

98
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,103
Okay. Well, back to the drawing board.

99
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,522
If we want him to understand
he doesn't belong here,

100
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,148
we don't need a drawing board.

101
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,359
We need to bust him open like a piñata.

102
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,319
We tried that in the Bad Place.

103
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,155
The goo that comes out
doesn't taste as good as candy.

104
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,741
-No, dude, metaphorically.
-Ah.

105
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,287
[gasps] Although, there is another
Bad Place strategy

106
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,997
that might work very well here.

107
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,751
I don't know if that's the right move.

108
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,545
It's our only move.

109
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,756
And we're doing it tomorrow.

Brent, I'm so sorry. We don't know
why all of this is happening.

Well, I do.
This chaos is clearly all about me.

124

that I don't belong here.

-I don't belong in the Good Place.

there's a place better than this.

I'm not sure we follow.

Well, I've been feeling this way
for a while now.

131
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,695
I mean, this can't be all
the afterlife has to offer,

I mean, if this is heaven,
then where are my guys?

Where's Scotty and Schultzy and Porcupine?

135

Where's White Guillermo,

136
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,457
and where is Mexican William
and what about Squirtman?

Well, he makes a good point.
What about Squirtman?

138
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,546
Also, frankly, my assistant Janet
is a little uptight.

139

I mean, she hasn't worn any of my gifts.

140
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,135
Have you been asking Janet
to make herself clothes,

141
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,387
that you give back to her?

142
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,223
Yeah, you're doing the math
right there, bud.

143
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,351
Look, this chaos, which is clearly
all about me, is a sign.

144
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,312
If this is the Good Place,
I belong in the Best Place.

Michael, I'm afraid
we need to talk about Eleanor.

149
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,286
I know what you're gonna say.
She's just been really busy.

150
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,206
I'm sure she'll get around
to showering at some point.

151
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,709
No, it's not that.
Although, it's not, not that.

152
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,754
It's possible we need a new team leader.

Oh, really?

154
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,342
We just can't help but question
her decision-making.

155
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,469
She balked at bringing
Chidi and Simone together.

156
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,930
She ignored my concerns about Linda.

157
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,224
Her plans for Brent backfired.

158
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:17,437
We've made precious little progress.
Perhaps leadership isn't her forte.

159
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,066
Yeah, I mean, Eleanor is dope,
but she keeps screwing everything up.

160
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,278
That's my thing.
And you wouldn't put me in charge.

161
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,488
Actually, that's a decent point.

162
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,574
But think about what you're saying here.

163
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,077
We have. We should at least discuss
pursuing a change in leadership.

164
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,580
Yeah, definitely, let's pursue it.

165
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,540
Oh, hey, Eleanor.

166
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,503
We were just talking about how maybe
you shouldn't be team leader.

167
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,755
Saved it.

168
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,674
Go ahead, guys. Speak your mind.

169
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,509
It isn't personal, Eleanor.

170
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:53,055
When we started this experiment,
I calculated a 9% chance of success.

171
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,851
After your first three days on the job,
it's down to 7.1%.

172
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:01,564
So purely from a mathematical standpoint,
you are kind of pooching it.

173
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,899
Very helpful feedback.

174
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,526
And if I could give you some feedback,

175
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,571
uh, I'd say that you're all
ungrateful ash-faces,

176
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,365
who can shove your fat grumps
all the way up your snork-box.

177
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,742
Which curses were those?

178
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,202
I didn't ask for this.

179
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,872
I'm only doing it because Michael,
who is supposed to be in charge,

180
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,707
had a nervous breakdown
the second it started.

181
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,459
But maybe you can do it better than me.

182
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,753
Tahani can be in charge
since she's so smart.

183
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,546
Or better yet, Jason.

184
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,507
Maybe all of humanity can be saved

185
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,301
with one good, old-fashioned
Jacksonville carnival.

186
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,304
I mean, we could try.
All I need is a bouncy house,

187
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,681
some ninja stars
and a bunch of ambulances.

188
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,767
Well, good luck, fork-faces. I quit.

189
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,644
Shellstrop out.

190
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,854
[door closes]

191
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,276
You get it all out of your system?

192
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,073
-You gonna come back, get to work?
-No, man, I meant what I said. I quit.

193
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,118
I'm sorry you overheard that,
and they're sorry they said it.

194
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,540
But you don't just
get to quit this, Eleanor.

195
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,334
This is not your seventh-grade band,

196
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,337
or three hours into
a two-week juice cleanse.

197
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,297
A little more at stake here.

198
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,425
Yeah, man, that's why I'm quitting.

199
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,762
The things that are happening here
are above my pay grade.

200
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,598
How do I get Brent
to stop being such a deckhead?

201
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,434
How do I fix Simone when she's convinced

202
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,895
all of this is happening
inside of her brain?

203
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,524
Ooh, maybe I should drive her
into the arms of my ex-boyfriend?

204
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,525
That sounds fun.

205
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,443
What do I do about John, the gossip king,

206
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,196
or the demon spy
who punched me in the face?

207
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,197
And how do I do it all

208
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,533
with a pleasant smile
to keep everyone's spirits up?

209
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,743
I'm not meant for this.

210
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,830
I'm not the freakin' savior
of the universe.

211
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,248
I'm just...

212
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,835
a girl from Arizona.

213
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,046
That's it.

214
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,090
I'm just a normal girl from Arizona.

215
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,595
I ate junk food, I watched reality shows,

216
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,514
I sometimes left H&amp;M
wearing more underpants

217
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,099
than I had on when I came in.

218
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,519
I did a bad job of being in charge
of my own life,

219
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,647
and now I'm supposed to be
in charge of everyone else's life? I...

220
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,317
I cannot do this.

221
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,866
[Michael sighs]

222
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,535
When I started my experiment,

223
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:24,915
I thought, "Four broken birdbrains
who will believe everything I tell them.

224
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,293
This will be a breeze."

225
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,463
You beat me in three months.

226
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,716
"Okay, fine," I thought, "a fluke."

227
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,802
You then you beat me 800 more times.

228
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:42,516
Because human beings,
it turns out, are weird,

229
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:47,063
and I will never truly understand
what it's like to be one.

230
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,316
This is a job for a human.

231
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:57,114
One who's tough, but also empathetic
and has a big heart,

232
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,702
and a world-class bullshirt detector.

233
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,038
You think you can't do this?

234
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:09,502
Eleanor, you're the only one
who can do this.

235
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,674
Like it or not, the only one
who can save humanity

236
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,177
is a girl from Arizona.

237
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,558
But everything I do blows up in my face.

238
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,814
I'm like a hot, blonde Wile E. Coyote.

239
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:30,898
That's true.

240
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,527
About you making lots of mistakes,

241
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,071
not the thing where
you sexualized a cartoon.

242
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,949
Come on, you know how this works.

243
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:44,120
You fail, and then you try something else,
and you fail again and again.

244
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,998
And you fail 1,000 times,
and you keep trying,

245
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:53,295
because maybe the 1,001st idea might work.

246
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,385
Now, I'm gonna go and try to find
our 1,001st idea.

247
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,638
I hope you'll join me.

248
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:08,102
I hope you shower first and then join me.

249
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,776
[sniffs]

250
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,741
Ladies and gentlemen, back with her
trademark brand of B-minus leadership,

251
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,076
Eleanor Shellstrop.

252
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,955
We are so, so, so sorry, Eleanor.
We never should've questioned you.

253
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,041
Don't worry about it, hot stuff.
I was questioning me, too.

254
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,920
But I'm back, baby.
And I have a new idea for Brent.

255
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,881
Guys like him never think they're wrong.

256
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,425
So, we're gonna tell him he's right.

257
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,219
[Michael] Brent?

258
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,476
This conversation
must remain confidential.

259
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,353
-Okay.
-Obviously, you're a very smart guy.

260
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,565
-Yes.
-But we need to know that we can trust you

261
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,358
with sensitive information.

262
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,610
You can.

263
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,405
I routinely buried HR complaints.
So, no problem.

264
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:05,826
The truth is, Brent, you figured us out.
[chuckles softly]

265
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,661
There is a Best Place.

266
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,580
I knew it! I knew it.

267
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:14,502
The Best Place is reserved for a select,
upper echelon of good people.

268
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,631
Sort of like a Diamond Elite
VIP club of afterlife residents.

269
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,050
I was Diamond Elite. I swear.

270
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,344
One time, I did shots
with this pilot in the lounge.

271
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,762
The guy let me fly his helicopter.

272
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,847
-We know. That's how you died.
-Right.

273
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,141
So, you'll all be evaluated,

274
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:34,063
and then a very small group of the most
morally upstanding residents get to go.

275
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:38,317
Oh, I see.
So, it's like a "good deeds" contest?

276
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,611
That's easy. I'm gonna crush this.

277
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,156
Oh, and hey, mum's the word, right?
Why tip off my competition?

278
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,241
[object clatters]

279
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:49,328
Oops! Looks like you dropped your fork.
Let me get that for you.

280
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,581
Did you get that? The fork thing?
Or should I start writing these down?

281
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,708
-You're good. We'll keep track.
-Great. Love it.

282
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,587
-Hi, Jason.
-Janet.

283
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,632
I'm so happy to see you.
I got you a box of chocolates.

284
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,969
But then I remembered
you can't eat, so I ate them,

285
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,138
and I thought it'd be a nice present
for me to describe them to you.

286
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,642
So, the first one was gross--

287
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,310
Jason, um, please just let me talk.

288
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,356
You know that I've been overwhelmed
with work since the neighborhood started.

289
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,692
-Yup.
-And I asked you to give me some space.

290
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,236
Yup.

291
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,029
[sighs] I'm so sorry to say this...

292
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,158
but I can't be
in a relationship with you right now.

293
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,036
Being with you is fun,
but it's not always easy,

294
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,247
and I'm afraid it would
endanger the experiment.

295
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,623
It won't though.

296
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,041
Jason, it already has.

297
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,211
So, why don't we just take a break
until it's all finished?

298
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,843
Also, I hate to pile on, but I feel
like you have a right to know.

299
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,095
[exhales]

300
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,557
The Jacksonville Jaguars
cut Blake Bortles.

301
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,561
He's not on the team anymore.
I am genuinely sorry.

302
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,361
[Brent] Hi, how are you?

303
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,113
Nice to see you. Enjoy your yogurt.

304
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,199
Problem is, now he's saddled
with a bad motivation.

305
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,618
His points won't go up

306
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,120
if the only reason he's being nice
is to make his points go up.

307
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,874
Yeah. But that was also my situation
when I first asked Chidi for help.

308
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,335
I only did it so you wouldn't catch me.

309
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,753
We have to hope that over time,

310
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,005
Brent starts doing good things
out of habit.

311
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,133
Just like you.

312
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,763
Hey, I just realized something.

313
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,934
That whole "You're the only one
who can save us" speech.

314
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,354
You didn't actually have
a nervous breakdown on day one, did you?

315
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,398
You faked it,
so that I would step up and take over.

316
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:42,858
[Michael chuckles softly]

317
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,946
-Guilty.
-You tricky devil. Very clever.

318
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,825
All right. Time to go help
Simone and Chidi.

319
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,829
Oof! Why did I come up with this idea?
This is gonna hurt real bad.

320
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,831
I know. I know.
But I think it's gonna work.

321
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,459
Yeah, but it's gonna suck for me.

322
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,420
You sure there's no other
girl from Arizona who can do this?

323
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,757
What about Emma Stone?
She's from there. She's very capable.

324
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,260
Remember her in <i>Zombieland?</i>
And <i>La La Land?</i>

325
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,221
What's with all her movies
ending with "land"?

326
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,098
-You're stalling.
-Yup. Heading out.

327
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,060
[Tahani] Oh, Jason, I'm so sorry.

328
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,396
Janet was my whole afterlife.

329
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,065
How am I gonna get over her?

330
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,943
I used to have a breakup routine
when a relationship ended.

331
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,071
Champagne and Alanis Morissette.

332
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,322
Not the actual singer.

333
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,742
I just listened to her albums
at my friend Adele's house.

334
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,329
I guess I could do
my normal breakup routine.

335
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,874
Drink a ton of Mountain Dew, steal an ATV

336
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,793
and ride it through a Panda Express.

337
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,171
But then I'd have to ask Janet
for the Mountain Dew and the ATV,

338
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,299
and then I'd have to see Janet,
and then I'd start crying.

339
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,386
-What do I do?
-I honestly don't know.

340
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:56,473
But whatever you do,
you'll be doing it with your friends.

341
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,148
[Jason] And I didn't even get to tell you
about the Blake Bortles part.

342
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:09,987
So, Chidi, do you remember that woman
Simone from the party the other night?

343
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,697
Simone...

344
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,366
the Third Eye Blind superfan

345
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,493
who walked around
cutting off people's ponytails?

346
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,037
That's the one.

347
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,123
Uh, I need your help,
acclimating her to the neighborhood.

348
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:25,794
I've tried, but since she thinks
this whole thing is imaginary,

349
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,298
and I'm an authority figure,
I'm extra suspicious.

350
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,800
Well, what makes you think
I'd have any more luck?

351
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,387
Chidi, you and Simone...

352
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,599
are soulmates.

353
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,229
Soulmates? Like our souls are...

354
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,190
are...

355
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,483
Mates, yes.

356
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,195
Everyone has people
that they're cosmically bound to,

357
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,947
and the system brings them together
in the afterlife.

358
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:59,536
And I can say, with complete certainty,
that you and Simone are two such people.

359
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,454
[chuckles]

360
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,957
I haven't told her yet.

361
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,168
I wouldn't have told you, ordinarily,

362
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,587
but since she's gone
a little cuckoo bananas...

363
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,006
That's the official architect term.

364
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,468
Uh, I thought it was prudent
to let you know.

365
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,887
Whoo, boy, uh... [chuckles]

366
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,097
I'm getting a stomachache.

367
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,976
But a good one! A happy stomachache!
This is new.

368
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,604
There are some great writings

369
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,358
on simulated realities
that might help her adjust.

370
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,984
Descartes, Moravec, Zhuang Zhou...

371
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,694
I wonder if I can summon a book
from my apartment.

372
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,157
Well, good luck.

373
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,910
This is incredible.

374
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:44,498
I spent my whole life in pursuit
of fundamental truths about the universe,

375
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:48,377
but I never actually
fell in love with someone.

376
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,337
I know.

377
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,675
Oh, right. Of course. [chuckles]
You know everything about me.

378
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,677
I do indeed.

379
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,604
Hi, Simone.
Uh, Chidi. From the other night.

380
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,857
Oh! Wow.

381
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,151
My brain must
really like keeping you around.

382
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,695
Have a fake seat
and grab a yogurt that doesn't exist.

383
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,155
Right, um...

384
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:22,286
So, if I understand your state of mind,
it's basically solipsism.

385
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,997
You think that you're
the only real thing in the universe,

386
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,584
and everything else
stems from your consciousness.

387
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,588
Yes, but to be fair, I only think that
because it's true and I'm right.

388
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:38,552
No offense, but solipsism,
as a philosophy, is pretty juvenile,

389
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,763
especially for a person
with multiple advanced degrees.

390
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,308
And it's also impossible to refute,

391
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,020
because everything you see
is confirmed by your belief.

392
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,479
However...

393
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,483
-[scoffs] Dude!
-What? If none of this is real,

394
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,611
then it really shouldn't matter, right?
In fact...

395
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,947
-[scoffs] Dude!
-What?

396
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,867
It's not real. None of this matters.

397
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,994
Leave that on your nose
for the rest of time.

398
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,622
Fine. Point sort of taken.

399
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,831
You know, in a larger sense,

400
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,125
if you go around acting like
no one else matters,

401
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,669
then you end up doing things
like knocking over cakes,

402
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:17,049
and pushing people into pools
and just generally acting like a jerk.

403
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,719
Why not treat them better,
just in case they're real?

404
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,221
I mean, what do you have to lose

405
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,265
by treating people
with kindness and respect?

406
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:30,395
Okay. Keep talking, probably-fake
but-maybe-real philosopher man.

407
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,986
[Eleanor] <i>Well, good news,</i>
<i>Simone and Chidi are hitting it off.</i>

408
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,906
{\an8}I mean, I wasn't getting
any use out of him as a boyfriend,

409
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,200
{\an8}so why not pass him off
to someone in need?

410
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,370
{\an8}Is this what donating
old bras to Goodwill feels like?

411
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,081
{\an8}It must have been really hard,
lying to Chidi like that.

412
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,375
{\an8}That's the thing,
I don't know that it was a lie.

413
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,460
{\an8}They did fall in love on Earth.

414
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,753
{\an8}And Michael was right.

415
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,715
{\an8}Chidi made a huge sacrifice for us,
and I had to make sure it was worth it.

416
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,219
{\an8}It's arguable that you made
an even bigger sacrifice.

417
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,097
{\an8}You actually have to live
with this situation.

418
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,059
{\an8}Chidi just gets to go around,
blissfully unaware of what he gave up.

419
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,936
Yeah, but we know what he gave up.

420
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,772
Dat ash.

421
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,277
Come on, bud. I know you're down,
but you can't leave me hanging.

422
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,821
You're right. That is the code.
