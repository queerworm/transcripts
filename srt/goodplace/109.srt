<i>♪ I see them bloom ♪</i>

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,763
Hey, ding-dongs.
We figured out what's happened here.

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,933
You two are both named Eleanor Shellstrop.

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,811
The day you died, you were
both in Phoenix, Arizona,

6
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:22,272
shopping at the same grocery store.

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,481
[blows raspberry]

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,942
The "real" Eleanor
was attending a conference

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,695
on the death penalty,
and you stopped by to pick up

10
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,530
food for a local homeless shelter.

11
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,825
And Fake Eleanor was there
buying margarita mix

12
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:38,621
and a magazine called, <i>"Celebrity</i>
<i>Baby Plastic Surgery Disasters."</i>

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,460
Incredibly, you both died in the
same 10,000th of a second,

14
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:47,380
in the same traffic accident,
because Real Eleanor

15
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,299
was trying to save Fake Eleanor's life

16
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,092
by pushing you out
of the way of the truck.

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,011
I guess you really botched that one, eh?

18
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,639
I did, and I am so, so sorry.

19
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,808
It's all good.

20
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,394
So, how did you not realize
you had the wrong Eleanor?

21
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,772
Oh, we don't know what people look like,

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,442
only names and profiles.
On Earth, they're just dots on a map.

23
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,278
Whatever, we got our wires crossed,

24
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,864
we picked up the wrong dot,
blah, blah, blah, blah,

25
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,284
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

26
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,578
Point is, there are two Eleanors.

27
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,540
The nice, boring one is yours.
The trash bag is ours.

28
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,793
-Eh--
-So, trash bag, let's go.

29
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,711
Let's hit it. And, also...

30
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,421
I'm still waiting on that smile, gorgeous.

31
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,923
-[Michael] Trevor.
-Where's that smile?

32
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,883
Trevor, how about we negotiate?
Give you something else?

33
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,636
What in the world could you have
that we would want?

34
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,638
All right, how about a unicorn?

35
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,598
Right? I bet you don't have one of those.

36
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,891
No, that is true, yeah.

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,518
-[laughs]
-Might be fun

38
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,436
to skin it alive, eat its raw flesh,

39
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,939
maybe break off the horn,
grind it up, snort it.

40
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,650
Okay, let's keep talking. Yeah.

41
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,283
{\an8}Fake Eleanor, a word?

42
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,994
{\an8}It's just me, man.
You can just say, "Eleanor."

43
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,789
{\an8}Sorry, it just makes things easier.

44
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,543
{\an8}Look, I'm not even sure how it would work
for you to stay here

45
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,002
{\an8}now that we know there's a "real" Eleanor,

46
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,047
{\an8}but in the meantime, stay on your toes.

47
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,383
{\an8}Don't let Trevor get inside your head.

48
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,634
{\an8}Can I ask you something?

49
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,804
{\an8}Why are you helping me?

50
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,474
{\an8}Well, Chidi made a very good
argument on your behalf,

51
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,976
{\an8}but it's more than that.

52
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:27,647
{\an8}I truly believe that The Good Place
is where you belong.

53
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,399
{\an8}You're part of our team.

54
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,405
{\an8}Hi! Oh, you must be
the new student Eleanor Shellstrop.

55
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,116
{\an8}I'm Gloria, the senior class secretary.

56
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,284
{\an8}Cool.

57
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:43,037
{\an8}Well, welcome to Adobe High,
home of the Scorpi-otes!

58
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,664
{\an8}Half the school wanted
to be the Scorpions,

59
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,417
{\an8}half wanted to be the Coyotes,
so we compromised.

60
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,669
{\an8}Why don't I give you a tour after lunch?

61
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,296
{\an8}Yeah, no thanks, mop-top.

62
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,589
{\an8}Uh, sorry?

63
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,757
{\an8}Don't need your help,

64
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,218
{\an8}don't wanna sign your yearbook
in, like, gel pen,

65
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,263
don't wanna bedazzle
our college essays, or whatever.

66
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,975
{\an8}I'm here for like six months,
and I'm gonna fly solo.

67
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,187
Beat it, Gloria.
She is, like, such a dork.

68
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,315
She, like, loves this school so much.

69
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,984
Why don't you come sit with us?
We'll teach you which guys are cute

70
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,986
and which teachers are secretly pervs--

71
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,405
Yeah, that's a hard pass as well.

72
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,490
I don't wanna get chunky highlights,

73
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,452
make fun of nerds, and steal
your mom's flavored vodka.

74
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,329
I get your whole "mean girl" thing,

75
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,164
and I'm all set with it, thanks.

76
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,498
In fact...

77
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,545
Listen up, everyone.

78
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:37,592
I'm Eleanor, I'm new here,
and as a blanket statement for everyone,

79
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,678
I don't wanna be a part
of whatever little group you've formed

80
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,889
because they're all equally lame.

81
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,225
Everybody cool? Great.

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,188
Hey, that was really cool,
the way you told all those posers--

83
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,564
No.

84
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,525
[Tahani] Michael, welcome.
How can I help you?

85
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,903
Well...

86
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,863
If I'm going to save Fake Eleanor,

87
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,617
I need some help negotiating.
I don't even know what to offer.

88
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,621
I mean, what do you get somebody
who wants to eat a unicorn?

89
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:10,792
A unicorn bib, yes!
No, no, uh, unicorn holders,

90
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,962
you know, like, like corn holders,
but for unicorns?

91
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,046
Perhaps, it'd be better

92
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,048
if we just move away
from the unicorn thing altogether.

93
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,549
[sighs] No, you're right, you're right.

94
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,551
And anyway, there's a bigger problem.

95
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,138
The Bad Place Crew,
they're all terrible bullies,

96
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,598
and they outnumber me.

97
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,518
They even have their own Bad Janet.
I'll show you.

98
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,602
Bad Janet?

99
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,979
-[tone sounds]
-What?

100
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,441
Bad Janet, uh, where is the nearest café?

101
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,360
Oh, um, that's a good question.

102
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,114
It's up your mom's butt, you fat dink.

103
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,491
-[tone sounds]
-What is even the purpose

104
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,451
of a Janet who behaves in such a manner?

105
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,787
Unclear, but the... The point is

106
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,749
I never have to deal with
negative emotion of any sort.

107
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,710
I could use some backup, Tahani.

108
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,044
Oh, Michael, of course.

109
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,005
Why don't you just bring them all here?

110
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,674
Surely, this magnificent house
will placate them.

111
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,343
Oh, perfect, perfect. I'll be right back.

112
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,013
[Eleanor] Well, here's... Your house.

113
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:09,600
It's beautiful,
I love Icelandic primitive design.

114
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,394
I kind of wish it had a clown nook, oh!

115
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,687
There it is.

116
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,856
Here's the bedroom.
It's kind of hard to get up

117
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,107
on this dumb ledge though, it's like--

118
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,109
[bell chimes]

119
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,652
[heavenly music plays]

120
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,695
[gasps]

121
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,698
You have got to be forking kidding me.

122
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,701
Hey, Fake Eleanor,
we used this same clown painting

123
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,162
to decorate the room you were
supposed to live in down there.

124
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,163
I swear to Bieber.

125
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,081
Wait, what was your house like?

126
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,001
Well, I was living in what I assume
is Eleanor's worst nightmare.

127
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,713
Every day was basically
one endless baby shower

128
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,006
for a woman I didn't know.

129
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,967
But also, somehow, I had to organize it.

130
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,971
And, if I didn't remember everyone's name,
I got a very strong electric shock.

131
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,431
Yep, that was my pitch.

132
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,017
And, then at night,
it was pretty classic torture.

133
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,063
Uh, flying piranhas,
lava monsters, college improv,

134
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,565
and there was always jazz music playing.

135
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,984
Ugh, I hate jazz.

136
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,738
Every jazz song is, like, 40 minutes long.
It's like, we get it.

137
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,408
You can blow on a trumpet.
Wrap it up, Elton John.

138
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,618
Famously a piano player.

139
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,330
I don't mean to be a bother,
but could I possibly get some water

140
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,956
and whatever food

141
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,666
doesn't turn to spiders in your mouth?

142
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,544
Oh, of course, so sorry.
Let's get some dinner.

143
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,380
Yeah, we'll all go. Perfect double date.

144
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,466
Two losers, a trash bag, and a demon.

145
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,009
Let's hit it.

146
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,137
Eeh! [laughs]

147
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,597
[classical music playing]

148
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,183
All right, Michael, we're going to ply
them with delicious food and drink,

149
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,103
and then we're going to subtly
segue into negotiation.

150
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,898
They're sure to be in a good mood.
Everything is absolutely beautiful.

151
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,109
This sucks, dude.

152
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,903
Yeah, this food, uh, blows.

153
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,196
Yo, Good Janet.

154
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,280
-[tone sounds]
-Hi, there.

155
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,449
Oh, gimme some jalapeño poppers.

156
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,577
Sure, quick question,
what is a "jalapeño"?

157
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,997
Also, what is a "poppers"?
Also, what is "jalapeño poppers"?

158
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,334
Oops! Sorry, guys. See, in the confusion,

159
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,712
Janet got rebooted,
so she hasn't quite uploaded

160
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,589
all of the info she usually knows.

161
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,716
[all laughing]

162
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,885
That's hilarious.

163
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,720
She's almost as stupid as people.

164
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,724
Oh, hey now, come on.
Let's not insult people, please.

165
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,687
[imitating Michael] I'm Michael,
I love idiot humans!

166
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:18,896
[all laughing]

167
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,399
I got to admit, that does sound like me.

168
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,652
"I got to admit, that does sound like me."

169
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,612
Oh, nailed it again.

170
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,031
Go get me a drink.

171
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,950
Yes, of course.

172
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:37,165
Ah, man, this is gonna make
a primo dump later on.

173
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,501
Well, that looks delicious. What is that?

174
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,547
Oh, it's Tom Yum Goong soup.
It reminds me of when I was in Thailand

175
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,257
rescuing victims of human trafficking.

176
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,260
Oh, that sounds so good.
I mean, the soup, not the...

177
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,595
Human trafficking.

178
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,930
Oh, and I think your grilled
eggplant looks so good.

179
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,390
Should we...

180
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,142
-[both] Splitsies?
-Yeah!

181
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,771
I can't believe you thought you could
pretend to be Real Eleanor.

182
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:06,194
She's like a perfect ball of light,
and you're like a... Wet pile of mulch.

183
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,113
Someone made a person
out of wet mulch and leaves

184
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,033
and, like, dead slugs, and that's you.

185
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,828
Whatever, it's easy when
you're just born perfect.

186
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,831
My parents were both dirt bags
who split up when I was eight.

187
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,291
I don't mean to eavesdrop,

188
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,168
but did you say
your parents got a divorce?

189
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,837
Yeah, and that kind of thing
really changes a person.

190
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,174
I mean, that trauma... It can explain away

191
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,342
a lot of behavior.

192
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,718
Oh, of course.

193
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,012
Your parents are still together, I guess.

194
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:37,350
Oh, actually, I'm not sure.
I never met my birth parents.

195
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,101
They put me in an empty fish tank

196
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,187
and abandoned me at
a train station in Bangladesh.

197
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,814
-[groans]
-Luckily, I was found

198
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,859
and adopted by a very nice couple,
the Shellstrops...

199
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,944
Oh, thank God.

200
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,820
But then they died when I was four...

201
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,781
-Bird flu.
-That's awful.

202
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,408
Anyway, orphanage burned down,
yadda, yadda, yadda.

203
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,203
Made my way to America,
yadda, yadda, yadda.

204
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,205
Learned English from watching <i>Seinfeld,</i>

205
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,166
put myself through law school,
and here I am.

206
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,126
Huh. And, I'm sorry, what...

207
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,545
What is it you said happened to you?

208
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,423
The same thing that happens
to half of all kids in America? [laughs]

209
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,971
And for you to have gone through all that,
and to end up where you did, it is just...

210
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,764
It's just amazing.

211
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,726
Oh, man, these horn-dogs
are vibing like mofos.

212
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,894
Am I right, Fake Eleanor?

213
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,063
Please, stop calling me that.

214
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,149
Oh, you got it, third wheel. [laughs]

215
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,819
Yeah, that wine's no good.
I'm sending it back.

216
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,951
Hey, Janet.

217
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,828
You look sad.

218
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,123
People keep asking me questions
that I don't know the answers to.

219
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,542
That was my whole life on Earth.

220
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,712
You know, it doesn't matter
if you know things.

221
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,423
All that matters is what's in your heart.

222
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,342
Thanks, Jianyu.
I mean, it does matter if I know things,

223
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,094
because I'm an informational
delivery system,

224
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,763
and I don't have a heart, but thanks.

225
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,309
Jianyu, I know usually
you ask me questions,

226
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,810
but can I ask you a question?

227
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,188
-Sure.
-What are jalapeño poppers?

228
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,690
Oh, I know this one!

229
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,943
Okay, they're deep fried
jalapeños filled with cheese.

230
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,113
One time, at a
Buffalo Wild Wings in Jacksonville,

231
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,532
but the nice one, not the one
above the gas station,

232
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,785
I ate 50 of them in two minutes.

233
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,038
Everyone at the hospital was so impressed.

234
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,914
Got it. Thanks, Jianyu.

235
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,374
You're welcome.

236
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,547
Why did you do that?

237
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,884
Because you're the only person
here that's nice to me.

238
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,510
Okay.

239
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,267
Anyone up for a little, uh, icebreaker?

240
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,227
You know, I once did trust falls
with Barry Diller,

241
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,396
and it was the beginning
of a lifelong friendship.

242
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,191
And then, once we trust each other,
then we can discuss

243
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,776
making a deal for Fake Eleanor.

244
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,988
This sucks. How do you guys eat
without listening to hard-core porn?

245
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,575
Oh, come on, this is The Good Place,
you can do anything you want.

246
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,079
What about throwing a rager
and totally trashing this place?

247
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,081
Woo-hoo. Yeah, I'd be into that.

248
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,791
We could totally go to town.

249
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,086
You know, I actually don't
think that's such a good idea.

250
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,504
Let's party!

251
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,172
<i>♪ Who let the dogs out? ♪</i>

252
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,507
Oh, my God!

253

<i>♪ Who let the dogs out?</i>
<i>Who, who, who who ♪</i>

254
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,598
So, um, Chidi tells me that
he's teaching you about ethics.

255
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,434
Yeah, actually, we've had some interesting

256
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,187
and in-depth classes.
He taught me about Plato

257
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,231
-and Socrates, Immanuel Kant--
-Yeah, cool, shut up.

258
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,149
Let's cut to the chase here.
You two go to Poundtown?

259
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,902
Poundtown, bro. You two bang it out?

260
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,822
She hot for teach? Did you pork the dork?

261
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,658
C'mon, girl, dish me dem dirty deets.

262
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,370
I assure you, our relationship
was "teacher-student," nothing more.

263
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,289
Chidi, you don't have to explain
anything to me.

264
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,167
Whatever happened before I arrived
is none of my business.

265
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,837
Hey, I'd love to see
the rest of the neighborhood.

266
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,713
Um, yes, it's incredible.

267
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,923
There's an amazing library,

268
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,509
there's a beautiful, piranha-free lake.

269
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,345
[chuckles] Well, please,
show me everything.

270
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,596
You ready, Eleanor?

271
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,183
I've seen it all already.
You guys go ahead.

272
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,811
You'd rather be alone with him?

273
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,313
Fire in the hole.
Watch your heads, ladies.

274
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,023
My dudes tend to boomerang
around the room.

275
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:20,781
Yeah, I mean, I don't need to walk around
and nerd out about old books. I'm good.

276
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,909
Okay.

277
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,747
Hey, a bunch of us are gonna go see
<i>Spider-Man 2</i> tonight.

278
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,207
Do you want to come?

279
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,168
They made a second <i>Spider-Man?</i>

280
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,669
What is there left to say?

281
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,421
Sure, whatever, I'm in.

282
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,714
Cool, okay, well, I'll get tickets

283
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,632
for the eight of us, and you can just
pay me back in cash.

284
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,802
So, you can get all the points
on your credit card,

285
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,887
and the rest of us get screwed?

286
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,346
-No way.
-No, it's just so

287
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,098
we can all get tickets
before they sell out.

288
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,516
Do you want to buy them?

289
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,687
So you guys can never pay me back,
and I'll be out like 80 bucks? Nice try.

290
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,398
I'll buy my own ticket.

291
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,400
The rest of the group
can do whatever they want.

292
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,155
Where did she end up?

293
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,953
Bought it with points, baby. My points.

294
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,917
I think I need to find
a new place to live.

295

-Oh... No, no, no, no.

00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,464

No, thank you, I don't use cocaine.

Oh, it's not cocaine, idiot.
We're snorting time.

302
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,433
Sorry... you're snorting
the concept of time?

303
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,477
Yeah, it'll fork you up.

304
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,231
Yo, monk dude, you know how to tap a keg?

-Karaoke time!
-[Dana] Whoo!

Dana, baby, what do you wanna do?

00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,197
Okay, Mussolini's speech?
Ooh, the Mel Gibson rant?

-That's a classic.
-Classic...

You know, maybe I'm not as great

00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,607
you just don't belong.

335
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,525
[exhales]

336
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,612
All right!

337
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,281
Let's go.

338
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,534
Okay, hold on, I have to ask,
is this thing gonna happen?

339
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,912
-You and me?
-Ew, no, gross.

340
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,414
Okay, you know I had to ask, babe.

341
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,715
[Michael] Oh, Tahani, I'm so sorry.

342
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,843
I will obviously clean all of this up.

343
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,595
I don't care about the house, Michael.

344
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,389
I'm just upset that you let them walk
all over you.

345
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,810
I know... They're the only thing
in the Universe that scares me.

346
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,145
I know what I have to do.

347
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,856
I just have to be... More accommodating.

348
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,776
Offer them everything they want,
give in to all of their demands,

349
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,444
and then they'll have to respect me.

350
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,364
No, you need to stand up for yourself.

351
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,199
I'm going to tell you
the same thing that I told

352
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,369
Mark Zuckerberg right before
he ousted Eduardo Saverin.

353
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,957
You are smart, you are capable,
and the time has come to hit "unfriend."

354
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,378
I also told Mark to lose the "the".
Just "Facebook."

355
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,672
That was me.

356
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,180
[coughs]

357
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,516
Oh!

358
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,518
Oh, my head.

359
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,269
Here, drink this.

360
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,856
How am I hung over?
I thought there were no hangovers here.

361
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,236
Well, The Bad Place Crew requested
that the hangover filter be turned off.

362
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,487
They like them.

363
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,074
So, Michael said we're meeting
at Tahani's place in an hour

364
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,868
for a negotiation session.
We'll walk over together?

365
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,414
You don't have to come, man. I'm good.

366
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,710
Just hang out with Real Eleanor
and name constellations

367
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,837
after each other,
or whatever it is nerds do.

368
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,380
I'm fine on my own.

369
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,508
Yeah, Eleanor, just because
we have a new guest in the house

370
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,885
doesn't mean I'm not still gonna
be there for you.

371
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,847
I'm in this. We're a team.

372
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,852
So, you've been temping
for us for a year now,

373
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,353
and we want to bring you
aboard permanently.

374
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,439
We think you'd be a great
addition to the team.

375
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,191
Yeah... No. I'm good.

376
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,402
You're turning it down?

377
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:12,448
I just don't think
I'm really one of you guys.

378
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,324
You're all obsessed with this place, man.

379
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,661
You love working here and talking
about working here,

380
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,456
and you all hang out
like some kind of cult.

381
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,124
We hang out after work
because we're friends.

382
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,084
I know. It's weird.

383
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,087
If this is how you really feel,
I think I have to fire you.

384
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,757
Severance pay. Love it.

385
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,383
Good looking out, boss.

386
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,094
Peace!

387
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,554
You need me to lie to old people

388
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,765
and scare them into
buying fake allergy medicine.

389
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,600
I get it, man. Which one's my desk?

390
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,018
That one, over there.

391
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,270
All you gotta do is hit your minimal sales
target every week.

392
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,650
Cool. And you guys don't have any lame,
mandatory office hangouts, right?

393
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,277
Hell no.

394
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,779
Some people go out for a drink after work,

395
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,655
and I like to run
the occasional group drill

396
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,741
to see how fast we can
shred evidence, but that's it.

397
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,911
Most days, you'll be able to avoid
even talking to another person here.

398
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,455
Perfect. Happy to be a part
of the not-team.

399
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,582
It'll be a pleasure
not hanging out with you.

400
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,669
All right, let's begin negotiations.

401
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,005
Now, we would like to discuss
various trades that we could--

402
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,174
Oh, yeah, we're not negotiating.

403
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,886
See, Fake Eleanor and I,
we bro-ed down pretty hard last night.

404
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,639
-We hooked up.
-No, we didn't.

405
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,726
Yeah, but who are they gonna believe...
me or a woman? [laughs]

406
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,561
[Alexis chuckles]

407
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,190
Point is, she knows that she
doesn't belong here, and she's giving up.

408
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,945
Is this true, Fake Eleanor?
Are you giving up?

409
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,365
Yeah, of course she is.
She knows this place isn't for her.

410
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,991
Let's go, ding-dong. Come on.

411
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,580
No, I'm not leaving.

412
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,624
Oh, come on, sweetheart,
we've been through this.

413
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,127
You know you don't belong here.

414
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,212
You're right. I don't...

415
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,258
But, I want to.

416
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,845
I used to never want
to be a part of any group,

417
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,472
but I'm a different person now,

418
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,268
because of the person who helped me,

419
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,186
and I want to be like him.

420
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,981
I want to be like
all the people who are here.

421
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,150
You can, Eleanor.

422
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,693
Thanks, Real Eleanor.

423
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,320
Hey, if you two aren't
gonna make out, just shut up.

424
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,989
Look, if you don't come with us,

425
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,700
we're gonna have to turn
this matter over to Shawn.

426
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,286
Oh, oh, no! Shawn, really?

427
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,496
Who's Shawn?

428
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,125
He's the wise, eternal
Judge who sits on high,

429
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,295
has the final say on all disputes
between our two realms.

430
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,797
And his name is Shawn?

431
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,175
Okay, look, I don't want
Shawn involved either.

432
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,761
So, how about you blow us away
with an offer, so we can end this.

433
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,764
Okay...

434
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,184
Here's my offer.

435
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,606
You get nothing!

436
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,818
We're not letting Fake Eleanor go,
and we're not giving you anything.

437
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,153
Get him, Michael!

438
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,822
You can summon
every evil creature you have,

439
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,993
every weapon in your arsenal,
every four-headed flying bear.

440
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:06,288
They have them down there.
But, we are not giving up.

441
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,833
I believe that Eleanor belongs
in The Good Place.

442
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,668
If I'm wrong,
you can take her to The Bad Place

443
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,838
and punish her all you want,
just really go to town on her.

444
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,131
Gah, gah, gah. Easy, buddy, easy.

445
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,549
But, she's staying here.

446
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,927
Now, all of you...

447
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,721
Get the fork out of my neighborhood.

448
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,978
[chuckles] You're on borrowed time,
Fake Eleanor.

449
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,689
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Let's roll, dummies.

450
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,234
Let's get one drink for the road.

451
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,944
-[Dana] Bye.
-[Alexis] Did you guys hear any of that?

452
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,197
Oh, my...

453
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,075
-[Tahani] Bravo, Michael, really.
-[applauding]

454
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,672
{\an8}Hello, Jianyu.

455
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,592
{\an8}You got sloppy.
I found your junk food all over the house,

456
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,928
{\an8}<i>and then, last night,</i>

457
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,347
{\an8}<i>you knew how to tap a keg.</i>

458
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,432
{\an8}<i>So, I thought I would come in here </i>

459
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,143
{\an8}and investigate
your little "meditation" den.

460
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,437
{\an8}And, what I found was this.

461
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,358
{\an8}Now, I don't know who you are,

462
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:21,029
{\an8}but I do know that you're not
a Buddhist monk.

463
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,323
So, let's chat, shall we?
