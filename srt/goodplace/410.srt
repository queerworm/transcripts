00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,587
Ugh. All Janet voids are nothing,

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,967
but Neutral Janet voids
are, like, the most nothing.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,344
Judge, please, please don't cancel Earth.

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,055
Why not? The system's broken.
You guys proved it.

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,850
I just wanna reboot the whole thing
and go back to my chambers.

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:22,021
I am on Season Three of <i>Justified,</i>
and can I just tell you, it is so good!

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,649
I, like, binged
all of Season Two in a day.

8
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,069
Think of all the amazing human achievement
you'd be eliminating.

9
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,864
The works of William Shakespeare,
the pyramids,

10
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,365
-Timothy Olyphant...
-[gasps]

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,450
Oh, that one stings.

12
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,995
There's like 50 gallons of man
in a ten-gallon hat.

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,164
I'm like "Ooh"!

14
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,876
Look, I'm the frickin' Judge,
and I made a frickin' ruling,

15
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:48,506
and it's gonna frickin' happen, as soon as
I find the frickin' clicker thing!

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,799
All right, what do I search for?

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:54,137
"Humanity eraser button
garage door opener thingy Judge."

18
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,847
Ugh!

19
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,685
Well, it wasn't in you. Any last words?

20
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,271
These are my last words. End of words.

21
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,106
Yes. Really boring.

22
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,441
Bye!

23
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,736
All right, who's next?

24
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,238
Your dad's pimply butt, you fat dink.

25
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:18,203
That is so interesting, because
last time I checked, I didn't have a dad.

26
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:23,374
That's why I'm attracted to all the
father figures on the TV shows I watch.

27
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,292
M'kay?

28
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,920
We can't play keep-away forever.

29
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,755
Keep trying. Get her to see the light.

30
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,257
I already showed her the light.
She wasn't impressed.

31
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,218
To be fair, she was there
when it was invented.

32
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,761
-Hey, bud.
-Hi!

33
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,514
I know you're trying to think
of ways to save every soul

34
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,890
who's ever lived and whatnot, but...

35
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,476
we may only have
a half hour left to exist,

36
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:46,856
so I just wanted to check in with you,
vis-à-vis... us.

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,900
Oh! Okay, yeah, cool.

38
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,818
I love you.

39
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,320
-Whoa! Really?
-Yeah.

40
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,281
I love you. So, do you love me?

41
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,324
Yeah, I do.

42
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,159
Well, then, cool!

43
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,662
-[chuckles]
-You and I are on our way to Coolsville.

44
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:06,126
You seem oddly sure, which is unlike you,
but it's kind of doing it for me.

45
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,460
Should we get out of here?

46
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,963
No, but I like the confidence.

47
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,173
When you have 1,000
different versions of yourself

48
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,424
over multiple timelines

49
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,844
fused and instantly placed
into your consciousness,

50
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,595
it gives you a real sense of clarity.

51
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,266
-You saw the Time Knife, huh?
-Yep, saw the Time Knife.

52
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,017
-[chuckles]
-It was neat.

53
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,312
Okay! Let's save humanity, shall we?

54
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,607
Can one of you Janets get me a chalkboard

55
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,944
and a copy of Judith Shklar's
<i>Ordinary Vices? </i>Oh!

56
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,487
And maybe some warm pretzels?

57
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,574
If we goin' out, I'm goin' out
with a belly full of warm pretzels.

58
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,533
Yummy, yum-yum.

59
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,160
Yummy!

60
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,545
Okay, before we try to completely redesign
the entire afterlife,

61
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,591
{\an8}has anyone just thought of a good reason
the Judge shouldn't cancel Earth?

62
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,217
Because it would be a bummer.

63
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,802
Yeah. We might need more than that.

64
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,554
Are you at least gonna write it down?

65
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,556
{\an8}Yeah, all right.

66
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,352
{\an8}Did you actually write it down
or did you just do a scribble-scrabble?

67
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,937
{\an8}Okay. We need to think bigger.

68
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,607
{\an8}We need to come up with
an entirely new afterlife system

69
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,278
{\an8}that both the Good and Bad Places
agree on, which... seems impossible.

70
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,281
{\an8}Nonsense. Compromise is always possible.

71
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,327
{\an8}I was once in Portofino with Bruno Mars,
LeBron James and Dr. Ruth Westheimer--

72
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,786
{\an8}We don't have time for this, babe.

73
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,123
{\an8}Fine. Long story short,
LeBron performed a successful tracheotomy,

74
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,376
{\an8}the song won multiple Grammys
and everyone was really happy.

75
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,878
{\an8}Well, now I wanna hear the story.

76
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,755
{\an8}No, you're right. Let's focus.

77
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,091
{\an8}So, in this essay,
"Putting Cruelty First,"

78
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,970
{\an8}Judith Shklar contends
that we should consider cruelty

79
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,805
{\an8}as society's primary flaw.

80
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,849
{\an8}I'm sorry, are you wearing roller skates?

81
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,267
{\an8}Yeah!

82
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,560
{\an8}I got 'em from Disco Janet.

83
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,478
{\an8}Thanks, Disco Janet!

84
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,395
{\an8}Solid!

85
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,897
{\an8}Anyway, here's her point.

86
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,774
{\an8}Imagine someone sells a joint

87
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,777
{\an8}and then gets locked away
in a dangerous prison for years.

88
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,905
{\an8}The crime isn't cruel,
but the punishment is.

89
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,864
{\an8}That's a problem.

90
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,782
{\an8}Tell me about it.

91
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,701
{\an8}I once went to jail for a week
just because I stole a hot dog.

92
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,079
{\an8}Well, a hot dog-shaped car.

93
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,580
{\an8}I stole the Wienermobile.

94
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,582
This is the problem
with the current system.

95
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,459
Live anything less than
the most exemplary life,

96
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,128
and you are brutally tortured forever,
with no recourse.

97
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,755
The cruelty of the punishment

98
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,925
does not match the cruelty
of the life that one has lived.

99
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,843
Now, watch this spin.

100
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,555
So, we need to come up with a system

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,433
that will result in the least amount
of cruelty and suffering

102
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,393
to those who don't deserve it.

103
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,186
This is a problem of justice.

104
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,821
Hearing you talk about
philosophical concepts of justice is sexy.

105
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,322
-You wanna get out of here?
-Yes.

106
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,782
No, keep going.

What if you start humanity over
from scratch

113
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,131
and humans evolve over millions of years
and they end up worse?

114
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,926
What if they invent rap rock sooner
and it becomes the only kind of music?

115
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,679
Do you really want to oversee
an entire world of Limp Bizkits,

117

Not my problem.

I agree.

Chidi should hook up with the Judge
to get us out of trouble.

there should be a Medium Place,

for people who led medium lives.
That's the answer.

146
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,123
We make the Medium Place a third option.

00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,208
Of course!

[Eleanor] Okay, you gotta tell me
that story on the way.

177

So, anyone who doesn't meet the threshold
for the new Medium Place neighborhood

is yours for the taking.

179
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,408
The Bad Place still has
plenty of people to torture.

180
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,536
I have to admit, this does make sense,

181
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,913

is settling for a crappy deal,

182

-The Bad Place will get emptied out, too.

You will have no one to torture

and the test will come in the afterlife.

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,145
We barely started.

341
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,857
Uh, so, when you die,
you still have a points total,

342
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,652
but in the new system, that number
will serve as a sort of baseline

343
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:08,324
to determine how hard or easy
your test is.

344
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,868
Sorry, I'm just trying
to play catch-up here.

345
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,871
Who's designing these tests, exactly?

346
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:18,792
A Good Place architect and
a Bad Place architect will work together

347
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,588
to design a scenario to make you confront
your moral shortcomings.

348
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:27,509
Like Eleanor's selfishness, Jason's
impulsivity, Chidi's indecisiveness

349
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,887
and my complete inability
to carry off a mod look.

350
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,890
-That's not--
-I know I have other faults,

351
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,516
but that is a big one.

352
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,018
The test could be anything.

353
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,896
Maybe you show up and you're told
you're in the Good Place,

354
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,731
but you know that it's a mistake.

355
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,734
Maybe the test
looks just like your regular life

356
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,070
or a twisted version of your life.

357
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,822
You're presented with these challenges.

358
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:54,536
You do well or badly, but at the end,
you're given a sort of evaluation.

359
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,665
Yeah, and the architects explain
what you did badly, what you did well,

360
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,417
and then you get rebooted,
and do it again,

361
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,379
and again and again until you ace it.

362
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,297
-In the new--
-Oh, hang on.

363
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:10,344
It seems to me, if y'all get rebooted,
your memories'll be wiped out.

364
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,637
How are you ever gonna learn anything

365
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,472
if you're always
having to start from scratch?

366
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,849
-[Judge] Mmm-hmm.
-Good point, Timothy Olyphant.

367
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,518
-Tim's fine.
-'Kay, great.

368
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,729
In the new system,
you will retain a vague memory

369
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,607
of what you learned
in the evaluation sessions.

370
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:28,070
That information, what you did well
or badly, stays with you, like...

371
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,198
Like a little voice in your head,

372
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,659
helping you become
a better version of yourself.

373
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,786
Okay, that helps. Thank you.

374
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,706
[Chidi] So, our guess is that
with enough chances,

375
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,251
people will eventually make enough good
choices to qualify for the Good Place,

376
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,253
and maybe some never will,

377
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,672
but that's okay,
because everyone gets a fair shot.

378
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,466
Hold the phone.
What are my demons doing this whole time?

379
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,720
I have millions of lava monsters
down there who'll be out of a job.

380
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,348
I ask you, into whose throats
are they supposed to pour lava?

381
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,768
Well, bad news is,
no more throat lava or penis flattenings.

382
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,396
Then, what are we doing to their penises?

383
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,106
Well, largely ignoring them.

384
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,443
You guys are hearing this.
I'm not crazy, right?

385
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,694
No, I mean, it's a fair question.

386
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,529
Whose side are you on, man?

387
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,032
I don't have a dog in this fight,
little lady.

388
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,575
I'm just looking for clarity.

389
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,118
Shawn, you'll all still have jobs.

390
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,538
Bad Place architects
help design the tests.

391
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,124
Rank and file demons, they'll play roles,

392
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,460
just like they did
in my original neighborhood.

393
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,628
And remember how much fun
you had playing the Judge?

394
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,089
I don't know, guys.
You think this'll work?

395
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,966
It sort of already has.

396
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,971
Chidi just had 800 versions of himself
stuffed into his soul at the same time.

397
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,183
I mean, he's a new man.
He's way cooler now.

398
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,561
Uh, I liked the old version, too,
but not as much.

399
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,063
It's not just Chidi, Your Honor.

400
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,856
When I started
in Michael's first neighborhood,

401
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,109
I was nothing more than
a PalmPilot in a cool vest,

402
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,569
but look at me now.

403
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,155
I can hold four humans in my void

404
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,075
and conjure Timothy Olyphant
in the blink of an eye.

405
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,995
Getting rebooted over and over made me
a better not-a-person than I've ever been.

406
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,372
Humans should get the same opportunity.

407
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,458
[heartfelt music playing]

408
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:05,918
Well?

409
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,383
Hmm.

410
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,468
Pass!

411
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,888
[Judge] Well, guys,
I really thought you had it.

412
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,016
It has been a genuine pleasure, sweetie.

413
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,851
Oh. [chuckles]

414
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:32,694
<i>♪ Gonna erase the Earth</i>
<i>Erase the Earth ♪</i>

415
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,074
I hid the clicker as far away as possible,
but we are seconds away.

416
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,534
I'm so sorry, guys.

417
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,660
Where did Shawn go?

418
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,079
Oh, don't bother.
He's just toying with us.

419
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,706
I know. That's what gives me hope.

420
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,167
-[urinating]
-[Shawn chuckles]

421
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,670
Had to do it one last time
before all this goes away for good.

422
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,173
-So, what are you offering me now?
-Nothing. It's over.

423
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,425
-That was our last idea.
-[zips pants]

424
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,343
Good.

425
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,720
Soon, all your precious humans
will be gone.

426
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,557
Yeah. It's too bad.

427
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,103
Well, congrats, bud. You won.
See you in a billion years.

428
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,940
When humans evolve again, I'll be
right back at your throat, you traitor!

429
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,401
[chuckles] I mean, yeah, I know.

430
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,154
That's why I said,
"See you in a billion years."

431
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,071
Wait.

432
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,490
I'm gonna do the evil speech now.

433
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,533
If you want.

434
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,617
[clears throat]

435
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,745
"Since the dawn of time,

436
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,665
good and evil have waged a furious battle,
stemming from..."

437
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,417
This feels stupid
if you're not gonna fight back.

438
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,545
How do you not have another plan?
You've always had another plan.

439
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,005
What's wrong, Shawn?

440
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,217
Okay, fine.

441
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,178
You're gonna make me admit it.

442
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,889
Fighting you is the most fun
I've ever had.

443
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:42,848
I mean, you know.

444
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,933
You corkscrew your first eyeball,
and you're like,

445
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,103
"Man, I can't believe
they're paying me to do this!"

446
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,024
But by the trillionth, it's like,
"I should have just been a teacher."

447
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,861
And then you go and get the warm fuzzies
about your little humans, and something...

448
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,613
something changed.

449
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,781
I was having fun again.

450
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,036
I'm not sure I'm ready for that to end.

451
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,495
I know, buddy.

452
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:10,167
It's hard when things end,
but one way or the other, this is over.

453
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,378
The only question is, what's next?

454
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,760
I heard your speech at Demon-Con.
You know this system stinks.

455
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,388
You wouldn't have let me try the original
experiment if things were working.

456
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,766
Let's try a new way.

457
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,351
Together.

458
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,231
[indistinct chatter]

459
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,649
[Judge] Okay, finally.

460
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,152
For the last time,
I, the Judge of the afterlife--

461
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,987
-Hang on, Your Honor.
-Argh!

462
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,530
Are you kidding me?

463
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,575
Can't a gal just end
all of humanity one time

464
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,078
{\an8}without everyone getting
all up on her junk?

465
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,373
{\an8}-What is it, man?
-Shawn has agreed to our proposal.

466
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,875
{\an8}-Wait, seriously?
-[Shawn] In principle, yes.

467
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,253
{\an8}-Still some kinks to work in.
-Out.

468
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,129
{\an8}Out. Sorry, old habits.

469
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,465
{\an8}But I think we can find a way
to make it work.

470
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,383
{\an8}[Jason] Guys, watch this!

471
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,593
{\an8}-[Judge] Jason!
-[all] No, no, no.

472
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,638
{\an8}Sorry. Jeez!

473
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,640
{\an8}[Judge] Okay, well...

474
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:12,229
{\an8}assuming we are redesigning the entire
afterlife according to this plan,

475
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,523
{\an8}what do we do first?

476
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,029
Oh, don't look at me.
I'm... I'm just the idea guy.
