00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,587
Ugh. All Janet voids are nothing,

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,967
but Neutral Janet voids
are, like, the most nothing.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,344
Judge, please, please don't cancel Earth.

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,055
Why not? The system's broken.
You guys proved it.

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,850
I just wanna reboot the whole thing
and go back to my chambers.

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:22,021
I am on Season Three of <i>Justified,</i>
and can I just tell you, it is so good!

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,649
I, like, binged
all of Season Two in a day.

8
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,069
Think of all the amazing human achievement
you'd be eliminating.

9
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,864
The works of William Shakespeare,
the pyramids,

10
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,365
-Timothy Olyphant...
-[gasps]

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,450
Oh, that one stings.

12
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,995
There's like 50 gallons of man
in a ten-gallon hat.

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,164
I'm like "Ooh"!

14
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,876
Look, I'm the frickin' Judge,
and I made a frickin' ruling,

15
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:48,506
and it's gonna frickin' happen, as soon as
I find the frickin' clicker thing!

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,799
All right, what do I search for?

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:54,137
"Humanity eraser button
garage door opener thingy Judge."

18
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,847
Ugh!

19
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,685
Well, it wasn't in you. Any last words?

20
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,271
These are my last words. End of words.

21
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,106
Yes. Really boring.

22
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,441
Bye!

23
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,736
All right, who's next?

24
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,238
Your dad's pimply butt, you fat dink.

25
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:18,203
That is so interesting, because
last time I checked, I didn't have a dad.

26
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:23,374
That's why I'm attracted to all the
father figures on the TV shows I watch.

27
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,292
M'kay?

28
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,920
We can't play keep-away forever.

29
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,755
Keep trying. Get her to see the light.

30
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,257
I already showed her the light.
She wasn't impressed.

31
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,218
To be fair, she was there
when it was invented.

32
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,761
-Hey, bud.
-Hi!

33
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,514
I know you're trying to think
of ways to save every soul

34
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,890
who's ever lived and whatnot, but...

35
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,476
we may only have
a half hour left to exist,

36
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:46,856
so I just wanted to check in with you,
vis-Ã -vis... us.

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,900
Oh! Okay, yeah, cool.

38
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,818
I love you.

39
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,320
-Whoa! Really?
-Yeah.

40
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,281
I love you. So, do you love me?

41
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,324
Yeah, I do.

42
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,159
Well, then, cool!

43
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,662
-[chuckles]
-You and I are on our way to Coolsville.

44
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:06,126
You seem oddly sure, which is unlike you,
but it's kind of doing it for me.

45
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,460
Should we get out of here?

46
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,963
No, but I like the confidence.

47
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,173
When you have 1,000
different versions of yourself

48
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,424
over multiple timelines

49
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,844
fused and instantly placed
into your consciousness,

50
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,595
it gives you a real sense of clarity.

51
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,266
-You saw the Time Knife, huh?
-Yep, saw the Time Knife.

52
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,017
-[chuckles]
-It was neat.

53
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,312
Okay! Let's save humanity, shall we?

54
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,607
Can one of you Janets get me a chalkboard

55
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,944
and a copy of Judith Shklar's
<i>Ordinary Vices? </i>Oh!

56
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,487
And maybe some warm pretzels?

57
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,574
If we goin' out, I'm goin' out
with a belly full of warm pretzels.

58
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,533
Yummy, yum-yum.

59
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,160
Yummy!

60
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,545
Okay, before we try to completely redesign
the entire afterlife,

61
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,591
{\an8}has anyone just thought of a good reason
the Judge shouldn't cancel Earth?

62
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,217
Because it would be a bummer.

63
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,802
Yeah. We might need more than that.

64
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,554
Are you at least gonna write it down?

65
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,556
{\an8}Yeah, all right.

66
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,352
{\an8}Did you actually write it down
or did you just do a scribble-scrabble?

67
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,937
{\an8}Okay. We need to think bigger.

68
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,607
{\an8}We need to come up with
an entirely new afterlife system

69
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,278
{\an8}that both the Good and Bad Places
agree on, which... seems impossible.

70
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,281
{\an8}Nonsense. Compromise is always possible.

71
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,327
{\an8}I was once in Portofino with Bruno Mars,
LeBron James and Dr. Ruth Westheimer--

72
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,786
{\an8}We don't have time for this, babe.

73
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,123
{\an8}Fine. Long story short,
LeBron performed a successful tracheotomy,

74
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,376
{\an8}the song won multiple Grammys
and everyone was really happy.

75
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,878
{\an8}Well, now I wanna hear the story.

76
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,755
{\an8}No, you're right. Let's focus.

77
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,091
{\an8}So, in this essay,
"Putting Cruelty First,"

78
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,970
{\an8}Judith Shklar contends
that we should consider cruelty

79
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,805
{\an8}as society's primary flaw.

80
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,849
{\an8}I'm sorry, are you wearing roller skates?

81
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,267
{\an8}Yeah!

82
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,560
{\an8}I got 'em from Disco Janet.

83
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,478
{\an8}Thanks, Disco Janet!

84
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,395
{\an8}Solid!

85
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,897
{\an8}Anyway, here's her point.

86
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,774
{\an8}Imagine someone sells a joint

87
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,777
{\an8}and then gets locked away
in a dangerous prison for years.

88
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,905
{\an8}The crime isn't cruel,
but the punishment is.

89
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,864
{\an8}That's a problem.

90
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,782
{\an8}Tell me about it.

91
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,701
{\an8}I once went to jail for a week
just because I stole a hot dog.

92
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,079
{\an8}Well, a hot dog-shaped car.

93
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,580
{\an8}I stole the Wienermobile.

94
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,582
This is the problem
with the current system.

95
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,459
Live anything less than
the most exemplary life,

96
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,128
and you are brutally tortured forever,
with no recourse.

97
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,755
The cruelty of the punishment

98
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,925
does not match the cruelty
of the life that one has lived.

99
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,843
Now, watch this spin.

100
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,555
So, we need to come up with a system

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,433
that will result in the least amount
of cruelty and suffering

102
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,393
to those who don't deserve it.

103
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,186
This is a problem of justice.

104
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,821
Hearing you talk about
philosophical concepts of justice is sexy.

105
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,322
-You wanna get out of here?
-Yes.

106
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,782
No, keep going.

What if you start humanity over
from scratch

113
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,131
and humans evolve over millions of years
and they end up worse?

114
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,926
What if they invent rap rock sooner
and it becomes the only kind of music?

115
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,679
Do you really want to oversee
an entire world of Limp Bizkits,

117

Not my problem.

I agree.

Chidi should hook up with the Judge
to get us out of trouble.

there should be a Medium Place,

for people who led medium lives.
That's the answer.

146

00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,208
Of course!

-Guys, they said yes. Let's take the win.

172
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,474
Now, all we have to do is convince Shawn.

173
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,559
I'll take the lead.

174
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,019
If I can convince Dr. Ruth
not to sue Bruno Mars

175
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,522
over songwriting credit on "Uptown Funk,"
I can handle this.

176
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,150
[Eleanor] Okay, you gotta tell me
that story on the way.

177
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,737
So, anyone who doesn't meet the threshold
for the new Medium Place neighborhood

178
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,864
is yours for the taking.

179
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,408
The Bad Place still has
plenty of people to torture.

180
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,536
I have to admit, this does make sense,

181
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,913
and I like that your side
is settling for a crappy deal,

182
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,874
while my side stays mostly the same.

183
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,210
What the hell? I'm in.

184
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,630
-Really?
-No! [laughs]

185
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,257
You actually believed me?

186
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,595
Dude, in 20 minutes, all of humanity
is going to be erased forever.

187
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,639
-And?
-The Bad Place will get emptied out, too.

188
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,852
You will have no one to torture
for billions of years. Everyone loses.

189
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,855
Oh, I know, but here's the thing.

190
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:06,194
I don't care if everyone loses,
as long as you lose.

191
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,279
Shawn, listen to reason.

192
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,197
[Shawn] Why should I?

193
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,240
None of this would have happened
if you hadn't mucked around

194
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,577
with your neighborhood and your new ideas.

195
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,079
New ideas are gross. They sicken me.

196
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,709
Shawn, you used to be cool,
but you've changed, man.

197
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,420
I'm gonna go write an evil speech
for when this is all over.

198
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,507
It is gonna be so... long.

199
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,675
[disco music playing]

200
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,971
[both]<i> âª You can ring my bell âª</i>

201
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,348
[Judge] Whoo!

202
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,016
[Judge laughs]

203
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,564
-Wait a second.
-[music stops]

204
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,649
What was I doing?

205
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,443
I'll tell ya what you were doing.
You were tearin' up the dance floor.

206
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,112
No. I was looking for
the stupid clicker thingy.

207
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,532
Gah! Those infectious disco grooves!

208
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,825
So, wait, wait, wait.

209
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,953
We have this amazing new idea
and Shawn is almost on board.

210
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,664
Maybe if you talked to him,
you could nudge him towards an agreement.

211
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,790
I don't take sides.

212
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,002
I am the Judge. My only concerns
are fairness and impartiality.

213
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:11,425
<i>âª Gonna erase the Earth</i>
<i>Erase the Earth âª</i>

214
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,928
That song is really my jam.

215
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,348
-[microphone feedback]
-Humanity eraser thingy.

216
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,308
[buzzer sounds]

217
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,437
Well, later, skater.

218
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,897
Keep on truckin'.

219
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,024
[Judge] Next!

220
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,570
Even for a demon,
Shawn is being a real knob.

221
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,447
Guys, I know what we have to offer him
to get him to change his mind.

222
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,448
What?

223
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,786
Something he wants.
Once we figure that out, we're golden.

224
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,496
[Michael] It's pointless.

225
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,250
He's so focused on beating us
that he's willing to burn everything down.

226
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,002
There's nothing we can offer him.

227
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,087
Actually, there is something he wants.

228
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,590
Cruelty.

229
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,675
So, let's give it to him.

230
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,892
Hey, guys. Just smashing some stuff.

231
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,937
-What's up?
-Listen, demon.

232
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,439
We know how much you want us to lose.

233
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,691
So, we volunteer to lose, permanently.

234
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,486
If you agree to let the Judge establish
a real Medium Place...

235
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,115
you can torture the four of us forever.

236
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,867
-Really?
-[Jason] Yeah.

237
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,244
This is a classic trolley problem.

238
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,372
One of your boys sets off a stink-bomb
on the trolley, causing a commotion,

239
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,459
so the rest of the crew can pickpocket
people as they run off the train.

240
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,420
That's very wrong,
but in a roundabout way,

241
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,672
you kinda got where you needed to be.

242
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,674
I'll even give you a head start
on my torture.

243
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,426
I cannot pull off the mod look.

244
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,677
You can take me, too.

245
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,681
I couldn't live with myself knowing
you four were down there without me.

246
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,560
Wow! This is a toughie.

247
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,980
On one hand, I would love to get
some spiders in those buttholes.

248
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,484
On the other, there'd be billions
of buttholes going completely un-spidered.

249
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,529
How about this: everyone who dies
goes to the Bad Place

250
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,948
and I get to torture all of you?

251
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,200
Sounds good to us.

252
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,785
No, dummies.

253
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,996
That's already how it works,
except we're also tortured.

254
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,915
Look, I put forward a proposal.

255
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,792
Are you not even going to negotiate?

256
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,127
He's got a point.
The fair thing for us to do is

257
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,047
just keep on giving up
more and more stuff we want, unilaterally,

258
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,590
until this demon is finally happy.

259
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,925
Fork this!

260
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,719
If we're gonna lose,
let's lose on our own terms.

261
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:23,391
Let's come up with a completely new idea
that actually makes the universe better.

262
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,060
Amen. At least then
we can hold our heads high.

263
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,145
Okay, we need to come up with

264
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,731
-our ideal plan in about ten minutes.
-[glass shatters]

265
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,234
Guys, it's all come to this.

266
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,986
Everything we've been through,

267
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,950
the multiple lives you led on Earth,
all the lives you led here,

268
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,619
all the ethics training and lessons,

269
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:47,581
and journeys to the farthest corners
of the afterlife,

270
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,544
all happened so that
we could be here, together,

271
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,797
as the very best versions of ourselves,

272
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,343
to solve the ultimate problem
in the nick of time.

273
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,429
Cool speech. Now, it's nine minutes.

274
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,471
[glass shatters]

275
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,266
Chidi, can you do this?

276
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,269
Actually, what you just said,
"the very best versions of ourselves,"

277
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,395
gave me an idea.

278
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,148
Ha! Turns out it was a cool speech.

279
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,107
[glass shatters]

280
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,027
Not in you, either.

281
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,196
-I just have one thing left to say.
-Beh-beh-beh.

282
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,782
-No--
-Not falling for that again.

283
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,741
[farting]

284
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,660
Man. She is committed.

285
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,037
That just leaves you.

286
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,415
Your Honor, we have an idea
we'd like to present.

287
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,041
Not interested, stretch.

288
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,587
How can we convince her of our plan
if she won't even listen?

289
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,673
Well, if she's not gonna stay out here,
you gotta go in there.

290
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,259
But that didn't really work great
last time.

291
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,260
Yeah, it wasn't amazing,

292
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,430
but she's gonna marbleize me in
two minutes, so we might as well try.

293
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,473
Are we all gonna be...

294
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,683
-you, again?
-[Janet] I don't think so.

295
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,935
Going through that once
changed me and all of you.

296
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,229
But if the Judge wasn't going to
listen to us out here,

297
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,690
what makes you think
she'll listen to us in there?

298
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,942
I know one thing
that might keep her attention.

299
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:03,866
Idiots.

300
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,162
[chuckles]

301
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,872
Oh, nuts!

302
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,166
How did I fall for that?

303
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,626
Please have a seat, Your Honor.

304
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,420
I already told you, I am not interested.

305
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,797
Give me one reason
why I should hear you out.

306
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,715
[Janet] Okay.

307
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,258
Here he is.

308
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,553
Ma'am.

309
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,101
You made me an Olyphant?

310
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,729
I think you should hear them out, Judge.
Only seems fair.

311
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,856
Yeah, you're probably right.

312
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,525
Well played, Janet.

313
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,654
I don't mind taking in the view
when the scenery is so pretty.

314
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,198
-Aw!
-Oh, I should call Shawn for this.

315
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,909
Aw, man!

316
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,411
I had just gotten all the puppies
to climb into the cannon.

317
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,538
All right.

318
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,456
Floor is yours.

319
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,416
So, the problem with the afterlife

320
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,962
is not only that it's cruel,
but that it's final.

321
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,465
You get one shot on Earth, and regardless
of the context of your life,

322
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,802
you're placed somewhere,
usually the Bad Place, forever,

323
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,845
with no chance for redemption.

324
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,558
My neighborhood was built to
torture humans, but it made them better.

325
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,436
We want to create a system
that works that way intentionally,

326
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,815
a system designed to give people
a fighting chance.

327
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,941
-In time--
-[Timothy] Huh?

328
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,110
-Interesting.
-[Eleanor] Oh.

329
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,070
Why don't you walk us through it?

330
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,322
Yeah, we're gonna, man. Just chill.

331
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:30,369
Your time on Earth won't be
a test that you either pass or fail,

332
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:34,790
but instead a class you take,
and the test will come in the afterlife.

333
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,375
The first part stays the same.

334
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,254
You live your life, screw up
a bunch of stuff, like, a lot of stuff,

335
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:45,259
to the point where people are like,
"This is messed up, even for Florida."

336
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,970
But you can't hear them,
because you fell into the swamp

337
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,015
trying to spray-paint a Taco Bell logo
on a snapping turtle.

338
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,058
Uh, we rest our case, Your Honor.

339
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,727
-No! No, we--
-No, no, no. No, we don't.

340
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,145
We barely started.

341
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,857
Uh, so, when you die,
you still have a points total,

342
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,652
but in the new system, that number
will serve as a sort of baseline

343
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:08,324
to determine how hard or easy
your test is.

344
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,868
Sorry, I'm just trying
to play catch-up here.

345
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,871
Who's designing these tests, exactly?

346
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:18,792
A Good Place architect and
a Bad Place architect will work together

347
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,588
to design a scenario to make you confront
your moral shortcomings.

348
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:27,509
Like Eleanor's selfishness, Jason's
impulsivity, Chidi's indecisiveness

349
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,887
and my complete inability
to carry off a mod look.

350
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,890
-That's not--
-I know I have other faults,

351
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,516
but that is a big one.

352
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,018
The test could be anything.

353
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,896
Maybe you show up and you're told
you're in the Good Place,

354
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,731
but you know that it's a mistake.

355
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,734
Maybe the test
looks just like your regular life

356
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,070
or a twisted version of your life.

357
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,822
You're presented with these challenges.

358
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:54,536
You do well or badly, but at the end,
you're given a sort of evaluation.

359
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,665
Yeah, and the architects explain
what you did badly, what you did well,

360
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,417
and then you get rebooted,
and do it again,

361
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,379
and again and again until you ace it.

362
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,297
-In the new--
-Oh, hang on.

363
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:10,344
It seems to me, if y'all get rebooted,
your memories'll be wiped out.

364
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,637
How are you ever gonna learn anything

365
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,472
if you're always
having to start from scratch?

366
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,849
-[Judge] Mmm-hmm.
-Good point, Timothy Olyphant.

367
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,518
-Tim's fine.
-'Kay, great.

368
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,729
In the new system,
you will retain a vague memory

369
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,607
of what you learned
in the evaluation sessions.

370
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:28,070
That information, what you did well
or badly, stays with you, like...

371
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,198
Like a little voice in your head,

372
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,659
helping you become
a better version of yourself.

373
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,786
Okay, that helps. Thank you.

374
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,706
[Chidi] So, our guess is that
with enough chances,

375
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,251
people will eventually make enough good
choices to qualify for the Good Place,

376
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,253
and maybe some never will,

377
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,672
but that's okay,
because everyone gets a fair shot.

378
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,466
Hold the phone.
What are my demons doing this whole time?

379
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,720
I have millions of lava monsters
down there who'll be out of a job.

380
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,348
I ask you, into whose throats
are they supposed to pour lava?

381
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,768
Well, bad news is,
no more throat lava or penis flattenings.

382
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,396
Then, what are we doing to their penises?

383
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,106
Well, largely ignoring them.

384
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,443
You guys are hearing this.
I'm not crazy, right?

385
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,694
No, I mean, it's a fair question.

386
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,529
Whose side are you on, man?

387
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,032
I don't have a dog in this fight,
little lady.

388
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,575
I'm just looking for clarity.

389
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,118
Shawn, you'll all still have jobs.

390
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,538
Bad Place architects
help design the tests.

391
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,124
Rank and file demons, they'll play roles,

392
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,460
just like they did
in my original neighborhood.

393
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,628
And remember how much fun
you had playing the Judge?

394
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,089
I don't know, guys.
You think this'll work?

395
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,966
It sort of already has.

396
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,971
Chidi just had 800 versions of himself
stuffed into his soul at the same time.

397
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,183
I mean, he's a new man.
He's way cooler now.

398
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,561
Uh, I liked the old version, too,
but not as much.

399
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,063
It's not just Chidi, Your Honor.

400
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,856
When I started
in Michael's first neighborhood,

401
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,109
I was nothing more than
a PalmPilot in a cool vest,

402
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,569
but look at me now.

403
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,155
I can hold four humans in my void

404
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,075
and conjure Timothy Olyphant
in the blink of an eye.

405
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,995
Getting rebooted over and over made me
a better not-a-person than I've ever been.

406
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,372
Humans should get the same opportunity.

407
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,458
[heartfelt music playing]

408
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:05,918
Well?

409
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,383
Hmm.

410
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,468
Pass!

411
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,888
[Judge] Well, guys,
I really thought you had it.

412
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,016
It has been a genuine pleasure, sweetie.

413
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,851
Oh. [chuckles]

414
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:32,694
<i>âª Gonna erase the Earth</i>
<i>Erase the Earth âª</i>

415
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,074
I hid the clicker as far away as possible,
but we are seconds away.

416
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,534
I'm so sorry, guys.

417
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,660
Where did Shawn go?

418
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,079
Oh, don't bother.
He's just toying with us.

419
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,706
I know. That's what gives me hope.

420
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,167
-[urinating]
-[Shawn chuckles]

421
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,670
Had to do it one last time
before all this goes away for good.

422
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,173
-So, what are you offering me now?
-Nothing. It's over.

423
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,425
-That was our last idea.
-[zips pants]

424
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,343
Good.

425
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,720
Soon, all your precious humans
will be gone.

426
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,557
Yeah. It's too bad.

427
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,103
Well, congrats, bud. You won.
See you in a billion years.

428
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,940
When humans evolve again, I'll be
right back at your throat, you traitor!

429
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,401
[chuckles] I mean, yeah, I know.

430
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,154
That's why I said,
"See you in a billion years."

431
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,071
Wait.

432
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,490
I'm gonna do the evil speech now.

433
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,533
If you want.

434
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,617
[clears throat]

435
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,745
"Since the dawn of time,

436
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,665
good and evil have waged a furious battle,
stemming from..."

437
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,417
This feels stupid
if you're not gonna fight back.

438
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,545
How do you not have another plan?
You've always had another plan.

439
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,005
What's wrong, Shawn?

440
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,217
Okay, fine.

441
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,178
You're gonna make me admit it.

442
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,889
Fighting you is the most fun
I've ever had.

443
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:42,848
I mean, you know.

444
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,933
You corkscrew your first eyeball,
and you're like,

445
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,103
"Man, I can't believe
they're paying me to do this!"

446
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,024
But by the trillionth, it's like,
"I should have just been a teacher."

447
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,861
And then you go and get the warm fuzzies
about your little humans, and something...

448
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,613
something changed.

449
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,781
I was having fun again.

450
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,036
I'm not sure I'm ready for that to end.

451
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,495
I know, buddy.

452
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:10,167
It's hard when things end,
but one way or the other, this is over.

453
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,378
The only question is, what's next?

454
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,760
I heard your speech at Demon-Con.
You know this system stinks.

455
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,388
You wouldn't have let me try the original
experiment if things were working.

456
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,766
Let's try a new way.

457
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,351
Together.

458
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,231
[indistinct chatter]

459
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,649
[Judge] Okay, finally.

460
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,152
For the last time,
I, the Judge of the afterlife--

461
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,987
-Hang on, Your Honor.
-Argh!

462
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,530
Are you kidding me?

463
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,575
Can't a gal just end
all of humanity one time

464
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,078
{\an8}without everyone getting
all up on her junk?

465
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,373
{\an8}-What is it, man?
-Shawn has agreed to our proposal.

466
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,875
{\an8}-Wait, seriously?
-[Shawn] In principle, yes.

467
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,253
{\an8}-Still some kinks to work in.
-Out.

468
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,129
{\an8}Out. Sorry, old habits.

469
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,465
{\an8}But I think we can find a way
to make it work.

470
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,383
{\an8}[Jason] Guys, watch this!

471
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,593
{\an8}-[Judge] Jason!
-[all] No, no, no.

472
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,638
{\an8}Sorry. Jeez!

473
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,640
{\an8}[Judge] Okay, well...

474
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:12,229
{\an8}assuming we are redesigning the entire
afterlife according to this plan,

475
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,523
{\an8}what do we do first?

476
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,029
Oh, don't look at me.
I'm... I'm just the idea guy.
