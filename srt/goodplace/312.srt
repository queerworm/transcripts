1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,252
{\an8}That's why I can't do it.

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,878
{\an8}It's too scary!

3
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,923
{\an8}[whining] Oh! No!

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,050
{\an8}-[knocking on door]
-[man] Hello?

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,720
Okay, listen. There's a guy out there

6
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,264
who's awake
and doesn't know what's happening.

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,890
Okay? You gotta pull it together!

8
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,477
-You've got this.
-No. I absolutely do not.

9
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,940
I'm not meant for any of this, Eleanor.
I'm just middle management!

10
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,608
-[shushes]
-What if I fail?

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,986
It'll be like the failure
to end all failures.

12
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,740
It'll be... [breathing heavily]
an epic fail.

13
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:35,368
Is my tie getting tighter,
or is my neck getting fatter, somehow?

14
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,370
Oh! This is what we do.

15
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,373
We tell the Judge we have to cancel
the experiment because I have a fat neck.

16
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,291
She'll understand.

17
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,834
[man knocking on door] Anyone?

18
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,169
-Okay, Michael, listen.
-Just--

19
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,005
You can do this. You are Michael.

20
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,341
You are smart and capable,
and you're a fearless leader.

21
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:54,471
And you are gonna take a deep breath,
stand up, open that door,

22
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:59,184
and say, "Hi, John. I'm Michael.
I'm the architect. Come on in."

23
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,310
Got it?

24
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,776
Hi, John. I'm Eleanor. I'm the architect.

25
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,360
Come on in.

26
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,498
{\an8}So... let me sum this up for you, John.

27
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,874
Ya dead.

28
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,375
-What?
-But don't worry.

29
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:30,757
{\an8}It's okay that you're dead, because you,
John Wheaton, are in the Good Place.

30
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,886
{\an8}You're here because of all
the incredible things you did on Earth,

31
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,138
{\an8}which are all right in front of me.

32
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,890
So, let me just check your file.

33
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,646
[Eleanor] Mmm. Good.
Yes, that's what I thought.

34
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,065
{\an8}Wow, John, what a life you've led.

35
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,193
{\an8}Sorry, did I introduce Michael? [chuckles]

36
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,778
{\an8}He's my assistant.

37
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,321
{\an8}Hi.

38
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,783
{\an8}He just transferred over here
from dog heaven.

39
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,244
{\an8}So, you know,
he's still getting used to people.

40
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,412
{\an8}What do you say I show you around
the neighborhood?

41
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,375
{\an8}[John] So, are you,
like, an angel or something?

42
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,336
{\an8}Oh, John! Aren't you sweet?
Enough about me.

43
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:14,050
{\an8}So everything you see
is here for you to enjoy for eternity.

44
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,638
{\an8}You and your 321 neighbors.

45
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,932
{\an8}Oh, why is it 322 people?

46
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,017
{\an8}Is that number significant somehow?

47
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,145
Well... Janet?

48
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,187
Hi, there.

49
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,731
It's me, Eleanor,
the architect of the neighborhood.

50
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:33,027
Yep, that is certainly information
that I already knew.

51
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:37,073
Janet is a walking database
of all the knowledge in the universe.

52
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,450
And since you, John, seemed to like asking

53
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,745
a relentless number of questions,
go ahead, ask her anything.

54
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,748
Okay, what's the craziest
secret celebrity hook-up?

55
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,544
Drake and Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
on and off for years.

56
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,087
Okay! Wow!

57
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,339
Wait, so you really do know everything?

58
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,675
Kinda seems like she should be
running the neighborhood.

59
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:59,512
Yes, John. In retrospect,
that does seem like a much better idea.

60
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,224
Hey, Janet, why don't you
take John inside to get some fro-yo?

61
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,269
We'll catch up with you later!

62
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,520
Get over here now, dummy!

63
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,646
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,481
Guys, guys, guys, guys...

65
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,027
Uh-oh. Michael looks like me. That's bad.

66
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,988
Fun little update,
Michael is feeling a bit overwhelmed.

67
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,741
So, new plan. I'm now the architect!

68
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,118
And stop making those faces

69
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,078
because I already told John
and there's no going back now.

70
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, if I could pick anyone
to impersonate an immortal deity...

71
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,961
well, it would be me,
but if it couldn't be me, it'd be you!

72
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,630
Yeah, you're gonna rock this.

73
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,257
You're like the Blake Bortles
of whatever's going on right now.

74
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,509
-I'm not really sure.
-[Eleanor] Thanks, guys.

75
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,053
I think I can be the architect.

76
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,555
I saw how Michael ran the neighborhood
in the memories he showed me,

77
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,599
and there was, like, a four-year period

78
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:48,269
where Brad Pitt really wanted everyone
to know how into architecture he was,

79
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,480
and I read a lot of those interviews,
so I think that might help me.

80
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,983
And before long,
Michael will be back to his old self

81
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,485
and he can step in and take over, right?

82
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,489
Look at the four of you, all together.

83
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,116
[cries] Oh, I love you so much!

84
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,911
Okay. Okay. That's okay.

85
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,039
Chidi, have Janet translate
the gibberish of these files.

86
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,165
-[Chidi] Okay.
-Tahani,

87
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,541
continue working on the welcome party.

88
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,709
Oh, yes, the party!

89
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,920
So, for the napkins,
I would normally do a queen's tuck,

90
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,381
but I was thinking of shaking things up
a bit with a Yorkshire butterfly.

91
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,926
And this could not matter less.
Very sorry. Goodbye.

92
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:20,885
[Michael chuckles]

93
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,305
-Hey. How's it going?
-This is overwhelming.

94
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,141
It's every thought and decision
and action from this guy's entire life.

95
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,353
Like, this whole box
is just one trip to Wendy's.

96
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,521
Well, keep reading.

97
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,315
According to Michael, I usually
asked for your help by, like, day two,

98
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,400
so you need to be ready.

99
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,819
You know what?

100
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,281
At first, I was kinda nervous,
but so far I think I'm doing okay.

101
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,658
It's like I became such a good person,

102
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:47,829
I almost forgot
I'm a world-class liar, baby!

103
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,123
Very fun thing
to hear from your girlfriend.

104
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,457
You're doing great.

105
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,920
And I have to admit,
you being the architect is kinda hot.

106
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,047
It's kinda like
I'm secretly dating my boss.

107
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,674
Not that I ever would've done that.

108
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:03,553
Yeah, no, me neither. So, same. Same.

109
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,513
All right, I gotta get ready
for the next person.

110
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,683
Well, then, I will say goodbye
to you platonically,

111
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,102
the same way a resident
would say goodbye to an architect.

112
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,023
Eleanor! What if John had seen us?

113
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,775
I'm scared, and yet, somehow turned on?

114
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,777
Scared is the best way to be horny!

115
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,904
[gasps and moans]
Now who's doing the teaching?

116
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,656
Hey, now, all right!

117
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,658
A little higher. Thank you.

118
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,535
Tahani Al-Jamil?

119
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,954
Yes. Do I know you?

120
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,664
No, no. But I know you.

121
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,168
I used to write about you all the time
on my blog, <i>The Gossip Toilet!</i>

122
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,920
We were the ones that invented
the Olsen twins countdown clock,

123
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,381
for when they became legal?
That was our blog! That was us.

124
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,717
-[John laughs]
-Oh, my.

125
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,552
You were quite mean to me.

126
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,553
Oh, no, I wouldn't call it mean.

127
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,430
Okay? My targets were
rich and high status,

128
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,516
and I was just doing the important work
of telling truth to power.

129
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,145
So wait, what about you? Huh?
You died in Canada? Ah!

130
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,023
That is so weird and embarrassing.

131
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,566
It's like the nipslip of dying.

132
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,151
Okay, listen, we're gonna catch up later.

133
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,278
I can't wait to hear
all about your new nose.

134
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,031
Oh, no, I... didn't get a nose job.

135
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,117
I know. I figured we're in heaven, so we
might as well fix all of our flaws, right?

136
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,579
Like, look at me.
Nothing is staying on this face.

137
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,372
[John laughs] Gosh.

138
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,627
What are the odds that you and I
would end up spending eternity together?

139
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,759
Eleanor? Michael? It is I, Tahani!

140
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,677
Yeah, we know, babe. What's wrong?

141
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,805
I know John! Rather, he knows me.

142
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,350
He's a gossip columnist
who tortured me on Earth.

143
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,270
He made it seem like I was shallow,
plagued with jealousy,

144
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,774
and prone to fits of melodrama!

145
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,819
-What are you saying?
-[Tahani] Don't you see?

146
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,696
The Bad Place
didn't pick the worst people.

147
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,908
They picked the people
who would be the worst for us!

148
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,912
Of course. How did I not anticipate this?

149
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,123
Shawn didn't just choose a bunch
of serial killers.

150
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,501
He chose your tormentors, or archrivals...

151
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,752
Or exes.

152
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,090
Those motherforkers!

153
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,264
This is insane!

154
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,141
And obviously against the rules!

155
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,435
Yeah, too bad it's not, dillhole.

156
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,602
She'll remember them!

157
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,064
It's going to destroy the integrity
of the experiment, Your Honor.

158
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,776
Plus, now I have to live next to a man
who once lied and said

159
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,654
I wasn't at Diddy's White Party!

160
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,533
I was there, Eleanor! I was!
You must believe me.

161
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,828
And how are we gonna make Simone better
when she's asleep the whole time?

162
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,996
Hello?

163
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,373
We can't work with this!

164
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,750
Your Honor, you never stipulated
that we couldn't choose people

165
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,335
who had some sort of connection to them.

166
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,631
Then Simone just happened to die on Earth,
which was really, really cool.

167
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,302
[chuckles] You wanna know
how it happened, Chidi? It's hilarious.

168
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,053
-No!
-[Judge] Okay. Here's my ruling.

169
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,806
It's not against the rules
for the four new humans

170
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,683
to have connections to the original four.

171
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,310
Simone and John can stay.

172
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,771
-Boo-yah!
-But it was kind of a dirty trick.

173
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:05,568
So, Michael can erase Simone's memory
to the point before she met any of you.

174
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,404
Fine. Have fun with your ex, Chidi.

175
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,365
What's that thing you humans say
when you're playing chess

176
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,702
and you trap your opponent
into an inescapable position?

177
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,620
Oh, right.

178
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,538
Eat butt, you dingdongs!

179
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,751
Okay. Okay. Focus, team!

180
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,127
Michael and I will prep for Simone.

181
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,587
Tahani, keep an eye on John.

182
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,756
Jason, talk to no one,
go nowhere, do nothing.

183
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,674
-I won't let you down.
-[Eleanor] Okay. Go, guys.

184
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,763
-Are you okay?
-I... No! Very obviously no.

185
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,433
Look. You could spend 100 years
in this neighborhood

186
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,726
before you even run into Simone.

187
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,394
It'll be easy to avoid her.

188
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,898
No, but we don't want me to avoid her.

189
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,817
The whole plan is that
I'm supposed to help them learn ethics

190
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,736
-so they can improve.
-Okay. Okay.

191
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,614
We can deal with that later.
Let's just take this step by step.

192
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,326
Step one, you leave
so I can snap your amnesiac ex-girlfriend

193
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,703
out of her post-death coma
and welcome her into fake heaven.

194
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,997
That's step one?

195
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,876
-Janet?
-Hi, there.

196
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,420
Give me your opinion.
Is this a savage insult?

197
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,758
"Nice shirt. Who designed it?
Mark Fake-obs?"

198
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,844
For people in your social class,
that is 84% savage.

199
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,139
Although, there is a 29% chance
he responds,

200
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,767
"Oh, honey," in a tone so devastating

201
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,811
you will think of it every day
for the rest of time.

202
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,062
I like those odds.

203
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,273
I'll go lay it on him now.

204
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,820
No. That's exactly
what the Bad Place wants me to do.

205
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,948
They sent John here
to drag me back into my old patterns.

206
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,076
Insecurity, obsession with social status.

207
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,453
I shan't let it happen.

208
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,165
John, I am happy you're here with me.

209
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,626
This is going to be good for both of us.

210
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,714
And I look forward to putting the past
behind us and becoming your friend.

211
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,841
Oh, my God, you are so cute.

212
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,719
You are so cute, it's gross.
You disgust me. I love you.

213
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,680
Get out of here. I never want
to see you again. I love you so much!

214
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,852
[exhales sharply]

215
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,189
Hi, Simone. I'm Eleanor. Come on in.

216
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:12,111
[Eleanor] So, as a neuroscientist,
are you surprised there's an afterlife?

217
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,279
[Simone] I am, frankly.

218
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,489
There's a decent chance this entire thing

219
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,533
is just a complex
electro-chemical reaction

220
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,329
caused by my synapses randomly firing
in the millisecond after my death.

221
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,124
But this fro-yo is amazing.
So, I'm just gonna roll with it.

222
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,251
-What flavor did you get?
-I got a twist.

223
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:31,297
Half strawberry, half "Male Co-Worker
Gets Called Out For Stealing Your Ideas."

224
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,757
Ooh! Those go great together.

225
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,258
-[man] Hi.
-Hi.

226
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,219
Wow! All the other residents seem so nice.

227
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,139
-The residents are great, yes.
-[Michael clears throat]

228
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:44,435
But, uh... don't feel like you need
to get to know all of them right away.

229
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,437
Maybe just talk to Michael and me

230
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,482
for the first, I don't know,
6,000 years or so.

231
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:53,069
Anyway, you just chill, baby girl.
We'll check in with you later.

232
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,867
[Eleanor] <i>That went pretty well, right?</i>

233
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,162
I've always been good at pretending
I've never met people before.

234
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,789
It's kinda my go-to power move.

235
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,792
I think this new dynamic
may actually be good.

236
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,379
You know, it gives me more time
to observe and plan.

237
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,297
You'll be the face of the operation,

238
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,758
and I'll be the mastermind
behind the scenes.

239
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,968
Like Cyrano de Bergerac.

240
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,054
Like Kris Jenner.

241
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:24,850
Oh! Totally. Yeah,
I think this is gonna be okay.

242
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,187
No. It won't. It won't be okay,

243
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:33,192
which is why you need to erase my memory
and reboot me.

244
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,363
What are you talking about?

245
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,198
No forking way! We're not rebooting you.

246
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:43,577
Shawn was right. Bringing Simone
to this neighborhood, it's checkmate.

247
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,079
It completely neutralizes me.

248
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,873
I'll be too freaked out
to help the new residents.

249
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:52,002
The only way to outflank Shawn is
to make it so I don't remember Simone.

250
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,296
So, you have to run into
your ex occasionally.

251
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,798
That's a part of life, man.

252
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,508
I used to run into my exes all the time.

253
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,468
At the mall, at the dentist's office,

254
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,304
when I drunk-texted them
and told them to come over...

255
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,014
Look, Simone is really perceptive.

256
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,516
I might slip up and reveal something.

257
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,310
This isn't just about me feeling awkward
around my ex.

258
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,604
It's more about
if I am awkward around my ex,

259
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,773
everyone gets tortured, forever!

260
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,861
No. There has to be another way.

261
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:21,824
Oh! I've got it. Just remove Simone from
Chidi's memory, and keep everything else.

262
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,368
-Boom!
-It doesn't work that way.

263
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,162
You all spent a lot of time together

264
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,789
so his memories of you and her
are all swirled together.

265
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,624
But let's keep thinking.

266
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,128
Guys, I've thought about this
from every angle.

267
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:39,467
If we don't wipe my memory, I will,
one way or the other, ruin the experiment.

268
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,512
-You know I'm right.
-No. No, man! It can't be.

269
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,974
Because if we erase your memory
all the way back to before you met Simone,

270
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,895
that includes Australia, and the study,
and the Soul Squad and everything!

271
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,396
That would be erasing...

272
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,357
Us. I know.

273
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,574
So, the plan is to erase Chidi's memory,
all the way back

274
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,619
to when the air conditioner fell
on his head, in his original timeline.

275
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,704
The Judge has given us
until tomorrow morning

276
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,706
before we have to bring in
the other two subjects.

277
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,959
Tahani, the welcome party
will be tomorrow night.

278
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,505
And the next time you see me,
it'll be like I'm a new resident.

279
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,423
I won't know any of you.

280
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,801
So, will you remember
that time in Australia

281
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,429
when we stayed up late
and ate pizza together?

282
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,680
No, buddy, I won't.

283
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,851
Will you remember
when we ordered the pizza?

284
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,855
-No.
-Will you remember pizza?

285
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,275
Will I remember what pizza is?

286
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,655
Yeah. I'll still know what pizza is.

287
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,365
Okay, so, not a total loss.

288
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,618
But this is awful.
You two won't be together anymore.

289
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,205
I haven't met a more perfect couple since
I set up Drake with Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

290
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,667
Yes, we will no longer be together.

291
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,213
The Bad Place has pulled off the most
intricate cork-blork of all time.

292
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,925
Hmm. It's a nice touch that
the cursing filter maintains the rhyme.

293
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,885
I appreciate that attention to detail.

294
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,887
[Michael] Hang on, I'm not giving up yet.

295
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,974
Let's have an old-fashioned
brainstorming session!

296
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,769
We'll get Chinese food, and we'll throw
pencils and stick them in the ceiling

297
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:18,941
and someone will say something innocuous
and I'll say, "Wait... say that again!"

298
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,403
Michael, if there was another choice,
we'd choose it. Believe me.

299
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,197
[Eleanor] You like
learning about humans, right?

300
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,908
This is a classic human situation.

301
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,077
Your friends
are going through something awful

302
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,954
and there is nothing you can do about it.

303
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:36,458
Anyway, let's just rip the Band-Aid off,
snappy, snappy, wipey, wipey.

304
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,379
I need a few minutes
to work it all out. So...

305
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,638
[Chidi] I hate this. And I'm sorry.

306
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,766
And did I say that I hate this?
Because I hate this.

307
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,229
You don't need to apologize for making
a huge sacrifice to save your friends.

308
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,233
This is why people love
moral philosophy professors.

309
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,860
[chuckling]

310
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,320
Well, how about this?

311
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:11,327
Every time you see me get a stomachache,
imagine I'm thinking of you.

312
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,580
-So, all the time?
-Exactly.

313
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,332
Sorry to interrupt.

314
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,252
I wanted to give both of you something
before we do this.

315
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,130
Think of it as a going away present.

316
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,599
[inaudible chatter]

317
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,482
[Eleanor sniffs]

318
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,694
I don't normally cry at movies.

319
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,613
But that one was pretty good.

320
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,657
That girl was hot.

321
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,619
-The guy was, too.
-[Chidi sighs]

322
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,415
I'm gonna miss you so much, Eleanor.

323
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,000
Except you won't.

324
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,211
That's what's so scary
about this whole thing.

325
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,422
I'm gonna miss you.

326
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:32,676
You're just gonna think
I'm some sexy, god-like figure,

327
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,262
who you wanna hump immediately
after meeting her.

328
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,931
I know you're deflecting by making jokes
about how hot you are--

329
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,184
It's not a joke! I'm a legit snack!

330
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,561
But I believe in you.

331
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,189
I am not even scared to get rebooted

332
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:49,610
because I know that you'll be here
taking care of me.

333
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,196
I wish we had more time together.

334
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,865
Time means nothing. Jeremy Bearimy, baby.

335
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,492
We'll get through this,

336
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,037
and then you and I can chill out
in the dot of the "i" forever.

337
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,038
Right.

338
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,165
We'll be okay.

339
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,920
We found each other before,
hundreds of times.

340
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,631
We can do it again.

341
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,637
[Chidi sighs]

342
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,891
Bye, Chidi.

343
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,411
-Janet?
-Hi, there.

344
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,871
Hi, Janet.

345
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,792
Can you just, you know, like,
tell me the answer?

346
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,338
-Sorry?
-You know, the answer. To everything.

347
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,049
You know all there is to know
in the universe.

348
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,467
Crunch the numbers.

349
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,760
Tell me the answer.

350
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,304
What's the point of love
if it's just gonna disappear?

351
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,724
And how is it worse to not love anybody?

352
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,853
There has to be meaning to existence,

353
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,773
otherwise the universe is just made of
pain and I don't like the thought of that.

354
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,567
So, tell me the answer!

355
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,902
I know how you feel.

356
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,407
Back on Earth, I had to watch
Jason have no recognition of me.

357
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,367
It felt like...

358
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,619
right before someone pushes
a plunger and murders you.

359
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,912
Sure.

360
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,833
The more human I become,
the less things make sense.

361
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,878
But that's part of the fun, right?

362
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,337
What do you mean?

363
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:37,050
If there were an answer I could give you
to how the universe works,

364
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,052
it wouldn't be special.

365
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,806
It would just be machinery
fulfilling its cosmic design.

366
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,351
It would just be a big, dumb
food processor.

367
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,897
But, since nothing seems to make sense,

368
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,652
when you find something
or someone that does, it's euphoria.

369
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,947
In all of this randomness,
in this pandemonium,

370
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:04,036
you and Chidi found each other
and you had a life together.

371
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,622
Isn't that remarkable?

372
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,375
Pandemonium is from <i>Paradise Lost.</i>

373
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,880
Milton called the center of hell
"pandemonium,"

374
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,049
meaning "place of all demons."

375
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,760
Chidi tricked me
into reading <i>Paradise Lost</i>

376
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:24,765
by telling me Satan was,
and I quote, "my type."

377
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,935
A big, mean, bald guy with a goatee.

378
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,478
I mean, he wasn't wrong.

379
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,605
Oh, no, that's very on-brand for you.

380
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,777
{\an8}I guess all I can do is
embrace the pandemonium.

381
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:43,533
{\an8}Find happiness in the unique insanity
of being here, now.

382
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,327
{\an8}We'll do this together.

383
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,872
{\an8}In the words of the man that I love...

384
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,500
{\an8}"I got you, dog."

385
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,835
{\an8}Thanks, Janet.

386
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,047
{\an8}You know, for a robot,
you make a really good girlfriend.

387
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,466
{\an8}I'm one out of three of those things.

388
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,427
{\an8}But thank you. Good luck.

389
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,182
Okay.

390
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,190
Hi, Chidi. I'm Eleanor.

391
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,776
Come on in.
