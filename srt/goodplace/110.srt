1
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:03,294
[Jianyu] Number five is number one.

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,130
Number seven is number two.

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:08,049
Number three and number four
are tied for number three.

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,801
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,469
I'm ranking my favorite
<i>Fast and the Furious </i>movies.

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,679
You said you wanted to know who I am,

7
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,764
and this is the best way
to get to know me.

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,808
No, it isn't.

9
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,852
You could tell me your real name,
for starters.

10
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:22,313
My name is Jason Mendoza. I'm from Florida

11
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,566
and I'm a professional, amateur deejay.

12
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,777
-And, is that a family member?
-I wish.

13
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,740
That's Ariana Grande,
the sexiest woman alive.

14
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:35,869
You wish that you were related
to a woman you want to have sex with.

15
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,289
You know what? It'd be one thing
if you just weren't a Buddhist monk,

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,001
but you're barely even a regular,
functioning person.

17
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,211
How did you get here?

18
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,672
I don't know, but, please, dawg,
you can't tell Michael about me.

19
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,049
You have some nerve asking me for favors

20
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:54,095
when you have spent weeks deceiving me,
making a fool out of me,

21
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,014
and bringing snack food into my house.

22
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,599
Disgusting!

23
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,730
Oh, Ariana, we're really in it now.

24
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,741
{\an8}Shawn, the judge, could show up
at any moment,

25
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,326
{\an8}so we need to have a rock-solid argument

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,871
{\an8}for why Fake Eleanor should not
be sent to The Bad Place.

27
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,956
{\an8}-Should be fun.
-That's the spirit!

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,458
{\an8}Don't even think about the fact

29
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,419
{\an8}that our slightest misstep
could cause Fake Eleanor

30
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,087
to suffer for eternity.

31
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,672
That's all I'm thinking about now.

32
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,300
{\an8}Yep, shouldn't have said that.
Regretted it immediately.

33
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,844
{\an8}Bambadjan was a human rights advocate,

34
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,056
{\an8}so he and Real Eleanor will
build a sort of legal argument.

35
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,850
{\an8}Um... [clears throat]
Could you please just say, "Eleanor?"

36
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,604
{\an8}And maybe point to whichever
one of us you're addressing?

37
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,732
{\an8}Well, actually, the fake/real
distinction helps me.

38
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,192
Oh, does it, Bambadjan?

39
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,987
{\an8}Now, I know a fair amount
about your time on Earth.

40
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,115
{\an8}Why don't you tell me
about your time here?

41
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,408
{\an8}Anything that might help your case.

42
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:01,121
{\an8}Well, in the first 24 hours,
I caused the world to erupt into chaos,

43
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,789
and then I caused a garbage storm.

44
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,082
It was kind of a rough start,

45
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,210
{\an8}but things calmed down
after Chidi started helping me

46
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,336
{\an8}learn about ethics.

47
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,171
Okay, tell me about that.

48
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,675
Well, I studied with Chidi every day,
and then Chidi got sick of me,

49
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,552
so I did some nice stuff
to make him feel better.

50
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,471
And later, I confessed because Chidi

51
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,350
was being tortured by guilt,
and I just felt awful,

52
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,812
seeing his little, nerdy face
all contorted.

53
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,105
"Oh, Eleanor,

54
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,400
"I have a stomach ache
because of what you did." [laughs]

55
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,735
He is such a dork.

56
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:39,659
You know, uh, a lot of death row inmates
feel regret about things they never said,

57
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,370
admissions of guilt, or anger,

58
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,913
or love.

59
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,500
Are you making a move on me?

60
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,878
It's fine. I just didn't see it coming.

61
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,505
-Uh...
-Well, hooking up with someone

62
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:57,010
with the exact same name, it is kind
of a fun, narcissistic fantasy--

63
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,344
No, no, Eleanor, I'm talking--

64
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,390
-I could be into it.
-Mmm. No, I'm talking about you and Chidi.

65
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:06,060
Now, ordinarily,
you having feelings for my soul mate

66
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,062
-would be a conflict of interest--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

67
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,480
You think I'm into Chidi?

68
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,649
Yes, Eleanor, I do.

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,401
Because you are.

70
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,238
You mentioned his name nine times
in the last ten minutes.

71
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,865
Nobody asked you, Bambadjan.

72
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,662
I'm not sure what will work with Shawn,
but we should have all our bases covered.

73
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,748
Shall we start with the Greeks,

74
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,876
or would you prefer
the modern British masters?

75
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,879
Chidi?

76
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,924
I'm sorry, choices are hard for me
when I'm under pressure.

77
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,800
I know that, buddy,
but we're short of time here,

78
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,011
and it's kind of important for Eleanor.

79
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:44,265
Right, which is why I can't take
this lightly. What if I screw up?

80
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,851
Listen, I don't need the Chidi
who once had a panic attack

81
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,063
during Rock-Paper-Scissors
because there were, and I quote,

82
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,356
"just too many variables."

83
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,860
I need the Chidi who stormed
in here and told me to stop

84
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,613
Eleanor's train without
thinking of consequences.

85
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,532
Oh, boy, now I'm nervous
about that decision.

86
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,535
Retroactively? I mean, how do you even?

87
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,412
I don't know.

88
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,249
Okay, we have so many big choices to make.
Let's start small.

89
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:14,462
Do you want to use a dry erase board
or the regular pen and paper?

90
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,632
Just pick.

91
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,092
[Uzo] <i>Chidi, just pick!</i>

92
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,511
Come on, Chidi, pick someone.

93
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,265
Don't pressure me, Uzo.
I have to consider all the factors.

94
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,516
Athletic strategies,

95
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,352
the fragile egos of my classmates,
and gender politics.

96
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,645
Should I pick a girl

97
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,982
as a gesture towards women's equality,
or is that pandering?

98
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,525
Or do I think it's pandering

99
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,570
because of my limited male point of view?
I'm vexed, Uzo, vexed.

100
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,532
You're always vexed. Just pick.

101
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,994
Okay, fine, I choose Tokunbo.

102
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,956
You can't draft the teacher. Pick a kid.

103
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,085
-[kid] Come on, Chidi. Just pick someone.
-[all clamoring]

104
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,045
[recess bell rings]

105
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,173
Congratulations, Chidi.
You filibustered recess.

106
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,592
[sighs]

107
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,720
No, no, no, you're wrong.

108
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,098
There are way more things
I hate about Chidi than like about him.

109
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,599
Like what?

110
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,520
[scoffs] His stupid Clark Kent glasses,
his extensive turtleneck collection,

111
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,063
oh, and he loves ethics so much.

112
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,817
He once talked about John Rawls
for two hours. I timed it.

113
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,194
And, he only stopped
because he saw me timing him.

114
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,405
Granted, he laughed,
and kind of made fun of himself,

115
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,698
it was a nice moment, but still.

116
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,160
He always twitches his eyebrows
when he says "absolutism,"

117
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,829
and he tilts his head
whenever I say anything ignorant,

118
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,874
but he never makes fun of me,
which is nice.

119
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,836
He's also incredibly patient, and kind,
and surprisingly jacked,

120
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,380
and, oh, fork, I'm in love with Chidi.

121
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,633
Let's take a little break.

122
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,136
I know this is awkward,

123
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,306
but as your advocate, and, I hope, friend,

124
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,975
I think you should tell Chidi
how you feel.

125
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,229
Would a hug make you feel better?

126
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,731
No, I don't think that it would--

127
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,357
Oh, too late, you're getting one.

128
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,861
Thanks, Bambadjan,
that does make me feel better.

129
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,240
[Tahani] Yet another lie.

130
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,868
You didn't paint this.
You got Janet to do it.

131
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,036
No, no, no, Chidi did it.

132
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,246
I got you an awesome painting,
but then he switched it

133
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,873
to this one because he said
you'd like it more,

134
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,416
and he made me memorize
stuff to say to you

135
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,627
so you wouldn't be so sad.

136
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,837
This is all his fault.
You should yell at him.

137
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,590
Chidi helped you make me happy.

138
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,842
It's almost as if he was trying to--

139
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,261
Oh...

140
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,138
Oh, my.

141
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,517
Of course.

142
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,103
This is the cool painting I made.

143
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,979
This guy's famous.

144
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,773
I mean, who even are those ladies?

145
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,820
Yeah, it would be easier to sort out
the issue of dry erase versus paper

146
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,405
if I could write down
the pros and cons for each,

147
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,573
but, of course,

148
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,368
I would have to use one of them
to write down the pros and cons

149
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,620
for them, which is problematic.

150
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,955
Wow.

151
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,415
[claps] Ethics team, how's it going?

152
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,000
-Terribly.
-Cool.

153
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,628
Well, you guys are kind of my last hope,
so that's not great.

154
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,838
[groans]

155
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,632
Hey, do you mind if I borrow
Professor Stomach Ache here for a second?

156
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,552
Please, take him for an hour,
take all the time you want.

157
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,181
[Eleanor] Okay, sit down, maybe.

158
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,100
[Chidi clears throat]

159
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,437
I dated many annoying guys, okay?

160
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,022
They would call me all times of the day

161
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:25,236
"just to talk" or ask me if I'd taken cash
out of their wallets, stupid stuff.

162
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,448
And, when I stopped having fun with them,
I'd leave.

163
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,076
Usually, wouldn't even call or anything.
I'd just bounce.

164
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,578
Gotta go spend that money you stole.

165
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:39,459
Point is, you are way more of a buzz kill
than any of those dudes.

166
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,502
Okay, thanks for this conversation.

167
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:46,466
But, somehow, I never want to leave you.

168
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,052
I want to stay in The Good Place
because of you.

169
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,096
Because I love you.

170
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,891
I think.

171
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,643
No, I'm pretty sure. Yeah, I love you.

172
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,689
Oh, that's embarrassing. [chuckles]
I feel so itchy. Sorry.

173
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,526
Don't say anything.
I just needed to get that off my chest.

174
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,030
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Catch you later, silly billy.

175
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,700
Ugh! Love has made me a nerd.

176
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,160
Bye.

177
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,996
Jianyu's a fake.

178
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,249
He's not supposed to be here.
Just like your "soul mate."

179
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,212
More importantly,
you did the ballerina painting

180
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,547
'cause you were trying
to protect my feelings,

181
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,216
because you love me.

182
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,176
Oh, Chidi, don't you see?

183
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,054
This is the real mistake
that was made in our neighborhood.

184
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:36,641
You and I are soul mates.
It makes so much sense.

185
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,102
-Oh, but--
-No, Chidi, true love is rare,

186
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,396
like a desert flower betwixt two oases,

187
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,191
but true love's also very simple.

188
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:50,029
And, right now, I'm just a girl,
towering over a boy,

189
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,199
asking him to admit he loves me.

190
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,661
I feel like her confession of love

191
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,330
was a lot better than mine.
Can I get a do-over?

192
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,711
I need to step outside... For some air,

193
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:10,466
and I will not be back for many days.

194
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,010
Dude, you can't just run away.
You have to...

195
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,513
[sighs]

196
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,684
{\an8}<i>It looks calm now,</i>
<i>but the storm is imminent. We're--</i>

197
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,144
{\an8}<i>What's up, Carson Daly? My name is Jason.</i>

198
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,690
{\an8}<i>I wanna give a shout-out</i>
<i>to all my homies up in Jacksonville.</i>

199
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,733
{\an8}<i>I am not Carson Daly. </i>
<i>I'm a weather reporter.</i>

200
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,069
{\an8}<i>A hurricane is coming.</i>
<i>You need to seek shelter.</i>

201
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,405
<i>-I'm on TV!</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

202
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,906
Hey, Janet?

203
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,576
Hi, there. What are you watching?

204
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,453
My greatest accomplishment ever.

205
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,248
I'm trying to cheer myself up
because I'm sad.

206
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,417
I think I might be in big trouble.

207
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,294
Can you bring me something
that will make me not sad?

208
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,628
Let me think.

209
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,215
Sorry that took so long.

210
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,010
-Here you go.
-Oh, dang.

211
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,554
Are these from my favorite restaurant,
Stupid Nick's Wing Dump?

212
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,599
Stupid Nick's closed down
because a pelican fell in the flash fryer.

213
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,894
But, he opened a new place,
called Ugly Nick's Meat Trench.

214
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,897
These are an exact replica of that recipe.

215
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,483
Why are you so nice to me?

216
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,031
Well, you were very nice to me
while I was rebooting.

217
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,700
Also, I'm programmed
to be nice to everyone.

218
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,038
Janet? I just realized something.

219
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,165
I love you.

220
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,125
Okay.

221
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,836
I have one more question for you.

222
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,216
So, you also love Chidi,
and you just told him,

223
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,470
just now, right before I did?

224
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,680
Technically, you told him
that he loves you, but yes.

225
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,932
This isn't ideal.

226
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,559
We must remain civil.

227
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,437
He's simply going to have
to pick one of us,

228
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,940
and the loser will just have to accept
her fate, with grace and equanimity.

229
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,275
Maybe if you lose.

230
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,195
If he doesn't pick me,
I'mma start throwing stuff.

231
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,279
Classy as always.

232
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,199
I suppose you knew that Jianyu was a fake,
didn't you?

233
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,784
Yes, I did.

234
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,328
Figured you two charlatans
would sniff each other out

235
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:06,248
like two mangy rats sharing a pizza
crust in a sewer--

236
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,918
Okay... No.

237
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,544
We're not gonna do this.

238
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,589
We are not gonna be those women
who fight over a guy,

239
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,217
and find any excuse
to rip each other apart.

240
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,677
I am not going to apologize
for being angry.

241
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,180
You knew that my soul mate
was lying to me.

242
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,933
Yes, I did, and I'm very sorry.

243
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:30,272
Listen, you and I have a weird,
complicated, forked-up friendship,

244
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,774
but it's our friendship,

245
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,610
and I care about it.
Let's do something fun.

246
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,529
What would make you feel happy, right now?

247
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,032
<i>You have a fine home, Deirdre.</i>

248
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,451
<i>I absolutely adore your chaise.</i>

249
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,538
[Deirdre] <i>I don't know bugger all </i>
<i>about a chaise--</i>

250
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,374
<i>I been using this</i>
<i>as a bloody toilet, I have.</i>

251
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:52,253
-What's this show called, again?
-[laughs] It's <i>Deirdre and Margaret.</i>

252
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,589
It ran for 16 years on the BBC.
They did nearly 30 episodes.

253
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,426
It's about two women
from very different worlds

254
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,719
who become friends, sort of like us.

255
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,764
<i>Oh, Deirdre, no! That's priceless art!</i>

256
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,683
<i>I thought it was fruit, innit?</i>

257
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,976
Deirdre.

258
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,980
-I take it the moron is me?
-Well, it's not a direct parallel.

259
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,024
Okay, we did your thing.
Now, it's my turn.

260
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,069
Are you ready to take
our bonding to the next level?

261
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,116
Oh, good, you're back.

262
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,659
I, uh... I know we're short on time,

263
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,078
but I need your help
with a personal dilemma.

264
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,415
This is about Fake Eleanor
and Real Eleanor.

265
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,001
Yes. Which person is my soul mate?

266
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:36,297
Real Eleanor, that's
what the system determined.

267
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,465
-Okay.
-Of course,

268
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:41,218
the system did screw up
by letting Fake Eleanor in.

269
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,805
You know, it's interesting.
Fake Eleanor being selected accidentally

270
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:49,268
and then you bonding with her
could have shifted the formula.

271
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,187
But, it's one of those two people.

272
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,730
Well, I... I don't know.

273
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,274
I mean, the system might be
so screwed up at this point,

274
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,026
that maybe you don't
belong to either Eleanor.

275
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,945
[groans]

276
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,867
-You is spreading...
-What?

277
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,411
Your indecisiveness is
infecting me like a virus.

278
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,123
Oh, Chidi, this could send us
down a very dangerous path.

279
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:15,336
If you can't make a choice,
this whole neighborhood could fall apart.

280
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,505
Okay, getting close here.

281
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,008
Just mulling the ethical
ramifications of various soups.

282
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,468
Oh, same old Chidi.

283
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,303
I can come back for a fifth time.

284
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,930
Yeah, you know, maybe that's smart.

285
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,142
-How are you? Uzo, it's been too long.
-It has, it has.

286
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,229
Look, as you know,
Ellen and I are engaged.

287
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,564
You're my oldest friend,
and I love you like a brother,

288
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,651
and that's why I'd like you
to not be my best man.

289
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,445
-Sorry?
-Look, if you were my best man,

290
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,281
you'd have to plan the bachelor party,
decide what to say in your toast,

291
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,659
handle problems that pop up the day of.

292
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,202
It would drive you up the wall.

293
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,205
Well, Uzo, this isn't choosing
soccer teams on a playground.

294
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,999
When some thing's important to me,
I can make a decision. Watch.

295
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,543
Uh, excuse me, excuse me.

296
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,835
I have decided I would like

297
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,756
-to unequivocally order the pumpkin soup.
-Perfect.

298
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,010
You kind of want to change your order.

299
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,428
Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.

300
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,722
-Yeah.
-Excuse me, risotto. Risotto?

301
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,225
[Tahani] As much as I'm enjoying this,

302
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,310
shouldn't we be working on your case
to try and stay here?

303
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,939
Honestly, how am I gonna help them?
They are much smarter than me.

304
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,024
Now, hair extensions?
This is where I shine.

305
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,778
You were already
at almost-maximum hotness,

306
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,115
but now you look like
a sexy, tan Rapunzel.

307
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,200
[sighs] The dream.

308
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,120
And, how exactly did you
learn how to do this?

309
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:36,292
When I was 14, I had to make
myself look older to get a job.

310
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,337
These were the ones I used,
and they are real cheap.

311
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,590
You're gonna want
to stay away from open flames,

312
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,301
and altercations at outlet malls.

313
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,802
[chuckles]

314
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,680
Hey...

315
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,309
I'm really sorry that
I didn't tell you about Jianyu,

316
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,978
and that you got saddled with him.

317
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,481
Yes, that is regrettable, but...

318
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,775
I forgive you.

319
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,737
Maybe you two are soul mates.

320
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,160
Holy shirt. Maybe we are.

321
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,746
I know it seems crazy, but think about it,

322
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,665
<i>Jianyu is a hot dummy, definitely my type.</i>

323
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,084
We both love to dance, we were both banned

324
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,961
from public transit systems in our cities.

325
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,504
I think this is the answer!

326
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,299
People come in pairs here,
and if the system paired us up,

327
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,886
then maybe somehow
I do belong here with him.

328
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:29,970
Hi, there.

329
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,598
Jason and I are getting married
in ten minutes,

330
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,099
{\an8}and you're invited.

331
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,899
Here, we've got your soul mate options,

332
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:45,402
Eleanor, Real Eleanor,

333
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,071
and a theoretical third person.

334
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,989
Let's call her strawberry mango twist.

335
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,991
Okay, close your eyes.

336
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,910
Think about each of the women.

337
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,913
Open your eyes.

338
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,958
-The answer is Real Eleanor.
-How do you know?

339
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,918
I don't, but the minute I said that,

340
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,587
you knew instinctively
whether it felt right.

341
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,880
Well, hang on, let me think about that.

342
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,507
-Because it--
-No, no.

343
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,134
No more thinking, Chidi.
Just do something.

344
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,179
Indecision caused you so much agony
in your life,

345
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,806
right up to the very end.

346
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,685
I had a little trouble writing my speech.

347
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,229
Um, I wrote 11 different versions.

348
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,106
Wedding's in 20 minutes, buddy.

349
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,733
Oh, boy, I mean, these
run about 55 minutes a piece.

350
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,193
I'm really hot!

351
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,611
Is this air-conditioner even working?

352
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,363
[Uzo] Yes, it is.

353
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,031
You're just having a literal meltdown.

354
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,034
Also, you're not dressed yet,
and we haven't picked up the rings.

355
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,078
Okay, well, there's an issue there.

356
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,456
Uh, involving what I consider
to be unfair labor practices

357
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,250
on the part of the jeweler.

358
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,584
And we never had a bachelor party

359
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,087
because you could never
settle on a location or time.

360
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,882
I'm sorry.

361
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,510
You were right. This is too much for me.

362
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,637
You should just leave me here
and go get married.

363
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,305
Yeah, here's the thing, bud,

364
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,307
my wedding isn't for another month.

365
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,477
This was a test to see
if you could handle being my best man,

366
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,730
and, just as I predicted,
you failed, miserably.

367
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:08,360
Oh, no. No, I mean, I'm relieved,
but this is embarrassing.

368
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,695
It's okay, bud.

369
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:13,157
Obviously, I prepared for this.
Let's just go have a nice night.

370
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,117
I'll buy you a beer.

371
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,702
Thirty minutes, Chidi?

372
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,829
We have been trying
to pick a bar for 30 minutes.

373
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,748
It is literally impossible
to be your friend.

374
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,583
You're incapable of making
a single decision.

375
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,084
Look, I know I can be indecisive,

376
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,628
but what's the harm in taking
a few extra minutes

377
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,755
to find the perfect--

378
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,593
Chidi?

379
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:36,472
You're right.
I just need to make a decision.

380
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,892
I'm gonna look each of these
women in the eye, trust my gut,

381
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,310
and figure out how I feel.

382
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,561
You're kidding. That worked?

383
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,606
Great! Go do it!

384
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,400
Ha!

385
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,402
[Jianyu] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

[upbeat wedding march music]

388
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,665
Yo, check it.

389
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,668
[laughs]

390
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,420
[Eleanor] This is great.

391
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,464
At different moments during our time here,

392
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:14,635
we both thought that Tragic Mike
over here was our one true love,

393
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,222
and now he is marrying whatever Janet is.

394
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,974
I suppose you're right.
It is a bit strange.

395
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,351
I'd like to read a poem.

396
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,145
Janet, my digital queen

397
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,439
Janet, we can dare to dream

398
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,067
Send nude pics of your heart to me.

-Jacksonville Jaguars rule!

400
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,615
Jason, when I was rebooted,
and I lost all my knowledge,

401
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:41,203
I was confused and disoriented,
but you were always kind to me.

402
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,205
And, according to the central theme

403
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:48,418
of 231,600 songs, movies,
poems, and novels

404
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,629
that I researched for these vows
in the last three seconds,

405
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,880
that's what love's all about.

406
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,842
Does anybody here object to this marriage?

407
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,052
-Yes, it is a terrible idea.
-Of course we do. How could we not object?

408
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,929
-Overruled. Jason?
-Mmm-hmm.

409
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,973
-Do you want me to be your wife?
-Yeah.

410
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,850
-I want you to be my husband.
-Tight.

411
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:07,771
So, by the power vested in me, by me,
I now pronounce us husband and wife.

412
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,189
We did it!

413
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,859
Can I kiss you, or will I be electrocuted?

414
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,318
Only one way to find out.

415
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,237
Whoo!

416
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,240
Get some! Got get it, girl!

417
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,867
-I'm just going with it now.

419
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,834
[Tahani] It's funny.

420
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:33,338
I was devastated when I found out
that he wasn't my soul mate,

421
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,799
but now I think I've dodged a bullet.

422
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,885
He's a simple man.

423
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,305
I once watched him eat electrical tape
right off the roll.

424
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,724
He thought it was
a Fruit by the Foot that had gone bad.

425
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,311
Thank you for being such
a great friend to me today.

426
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,855
Of course, hot stuff. I got your back.

427
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:55,652
Eleanor, hey, I just wanted
to see if you'd talked to Chidi.

428
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,070
Uh, yeah, I did.

429
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,614
I mean, you don't have to
tell me what you said.

430
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,949
I just wanted to see if you're okay.

431
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,367
Oh, man, you are a good person.

432
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,079
I swear, if I had known you
and Tahani and Chidi on Earth,

433
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,207
I might have for real
gotten into The Good Place.

434
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,170
Oh! Hey, it's my three favorite yogurts.

435
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,173
Hey, um, about what happened earlier...

436
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,176
I've been kind of all over
the place today.

437
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,054
An hour ago, I thought
Jianyu was my soul mate,

438
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,389
and the fact that that kind of made sense

439
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,600
means you and I could never
be meant for each other.

440
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,518
Plus, Jianyu's married to Janet now.

441
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,645
Okay.

442
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,439
What?

443
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,900
I do love you, but I think more

444
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,570
in a best friend,
afterlife-savior kind of way.

445
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,697
I'm not so much "hot for teacher"

446
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:46,578
as I am eternally grateful for
"semi-cute, surprisingly ripped teacher."

447
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,747
Chidi, I also have to apologize.

448
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,333
{\an8}It's just that when I found out
that Jianyu wasn't my soul mate,

449
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,627
{\an8}I desperately needed something
to keep me afloat,

450
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,672
{\an8}and, well, you were the nearest
lifeboat, as it were.

451
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,007
{\an8}And, yes, we do have
the sort of connection

452
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,510
{\an8}that only two highly-educated,
sophisticates could have,

453
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,845
{\an8}but it's not true love.

454
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,765
{\an8}True love is what Janet and Jianyu have.

455
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,809
{\an8}Yeah. What?

456
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,812
{\an8}Oh, we would love to stay and chat,
but we need to find Michael.

457
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,357

a way for you to stay.
