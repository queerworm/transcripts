1
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,008
[panting]

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:12,137
Okay.
That was an insane thing for us to do.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,683
Oh! Okay, good news,
I have the Doorman's key,

4
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,143
so no one will be able to come after us.

5
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,146
-Let's just try to--
-[bell ringing]

6
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,941
Your key is ringing.

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,279
<i>I have a question for you:</i>
<i>Are you out of your damn mind?</i>

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,531
Your Honor,
look at it from my point of view.

9
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:36,786
I have never been this angry in my life,
which is the age of the universe!

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,083
I understand, but saving the souls of
these four humans is more important,

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,377
so we're not coming back until we do.

12
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,837
[Judge] <i>Don't you even try</i>
<i>coming back here,</i>

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,758
<i>'cause when you walk through that door,</i>
<i>I am gonna be waiting for you.</i>

14
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,926
Sorry, Judge, I think you're breaking up!

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,554
<i>That's impossible.</i>
<i>It's a magical key, you dick. </i>

16
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,265
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>I can see you.</i>

17
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,144
This is perfect.
We're right near Chidi's office,

18
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,605
and as far as I can tell,
the whole floor is abandoned.

19
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,732
What do they use it for?
Storage?

20
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,776
-No, this is the journalism department.
-Ah!

21
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,361
Bad for the world, good for us.

22
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,990
So, somehow, with none of our powers,

23
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:18,453
we have to keep the group intact
and monitor their ethical progress.

24
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,874
-So, how do we do that?
-Not sure.

25
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,293
There's no way to track
people's actual point totals.

26
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,836
Only the accountants
have that information.

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,382
But I did install cameras and microphones,
so at least we can keep our eye on them.

28
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,260
-Let's get peepin'!
-[exclaims]

29
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,305
[Janet] Oh, no. Not a great start.

30
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,891
Eleanor farted,
and then she blamed it on her chair.

31
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,352
That's gonna cost her
at least a few points.

32
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,354
There's a bolt missing or something.

33
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,857
Before we begin,
Trevor is dropping out of the study.

34
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,110
He sent me an email last night.

35
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:54,364
"I'm sad to inform you that I am too ugly
and stupid to be in the study,

36
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,324
and I'm going home to my mommy."

37
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,535
That was me.
I wrote that email.

38
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,455
That's too bad, but we press on.
We're on to stage two of the study.

39
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,874
I'm going to teach you
some philosophical principles,

40
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,417
and then we will explore how those ideas

41
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,586
have affected your personal
moral machineries--

42
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,880
-[Eleanor farts]
-Sorry, Eleanor, did you say something?

43
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,842
No, it's my chair.
It's got this weird design.

44
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,176
Your chair smells bad.

45
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,472
I know! See?
Another person who agrees it's the chair.

46
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:31,693
Great news, everyone! The funding from
the neuroscience department came through!

47
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,987
{\an8}And you blew it all on cupcakes?

48
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,739
{\an8}Exactly what I would have done.
Respect.

49
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,907
{\an8}[Simone] Eleanor?

50
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,327
{\an8}Uh, I'm good. I try to avoid
pointless group activities.

51
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,455
{\an8}You know, like office Christmas parties,
or jury duty.

52
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,417
{\an8}To me, the single most awful sound
in the universe

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,962
{\an8}is that mangled opening note of
your co-workers singing "Happy Birthday."

54
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:55,008
{\an8}Cool stance. Counterpoint:
these are delicious free cupcakes.

55
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,175
{\an8}Get over yourself and eat one.

56
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,594
{\an8}Fine.

57
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:02,056
{\an8}[Simone] You guys, let's take a picture!
Everyone get in, get in, and say...

58
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,976
{\an8}oh, say "ventromedial pre-frontal cortex!"

59
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,271
{\an8}-Ventromedial pre-frontal cortex.
-Jaguars rule!

60
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,188
[inaudible]

61
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,737
[Eleanor] <i>Hey, teach? I've been having</i>
<i>so much fun here,</i>

62
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,866
{\an8}but I didn't plan to stay in Australia
this long, and I'm super broke.

63
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,160
{\an8}Any idea where I can get a part-time gig?

64
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,661
{\an8}What kind of work are you looking for?

65
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,538
{\an8}Well, I'm really good at telemarketing.

66
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,584
{\an8}I can usually guess how long to microwave
food without looking at the box.

67
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,170
{\an8}I'd say those are my two main skills.

68
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,171
{\an8}Okay!

69
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,172
{\an8}Dang it.

70
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,592
{\an8}If Eleanor has to get a job,
she'll miss class,

71
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,469
and that'll slow down her progress.

72
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,933
Are you sure we should be doing this?
It kind of feels like cheating.

73
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,101
No, no, no, it's not cheating.

74
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:51,564
Think of us as a snowplow,
clearing a path for Eleanor,

75
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,193
so she can more easily
drive along the road of improvement.

76
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,905
Ooh, I love that!
You really painted a picture there.

77
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,700
-G'day. How can I help you?
-One scratch-off lottery ticket, please.

78
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,997
Oh, not that one.
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

79
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,583
These tickets were printed
before we got down here.

80
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,834
I know which ones are the winners.

81
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,878
And stop! That's the one!

82
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,506
Good ol' lucky number 186 from the bottom!

83
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,882
Here you go.

84
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,427
Also, that bathroom key that you lost
nine months ago slid under the register.

85
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:26,557
And the woman that you think is your aunt
is actually your mom. Okay, bye!

86
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,687
You guys, this is nuts!

87
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,857
This morning, I found a lottery ticket
on the ground outside my apartment.

88
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,071
I scratched it off, and I won $18,000!

89
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,489
-[Chidi] Wow!
-[Jason] That's amazing!

90
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,824
Better luck next time.

91
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:49,539
Yes, sorry, from context, I see
that is actually a large sum of money.

92
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,294
[inaudible]

93
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,216
Jason, you okay there, mate?

94
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,971
No. I have to watch the Jaguar games
alone, on my computer,

95
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,140
at 3:00 in the morning, on Mondays.

96
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,892
It's so annoying.
Everything here is in a...

97
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:15,023
I don't know how to describe it...
like, a different zone of time.

98
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,692
No, that sounds stupid.

99
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:18,901
A different clock land.

100
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,322
I'll watch the game with you, Jason!
I enjoy American football.

101
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,490
I actually dated a player once.

102
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,952
But he wasn't my type, so I set him up
with my friend Gisele...

103
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,370
BÃ¼ndchen.

104
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,830
Yeah, we got it. We always get it.

105
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,709
Awesome! But if you want to watch with me,
you have to learn my Jaguars cheer.

106
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:39,630
It goes, "Let's go, Jags!
Kick their ass! Yeah!"

107
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,133
Do you think you can learn that
by the weekend?

108
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,678
-I shall do my best.
-[Jason] Nice! See you then!

109
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,681
Why do you want to watch
football with Jason?

110
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:53,311
I don't, really. But I am, these days,
as you might say in America,

111
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,896
"mad horny."

112
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,815
-Oh! Okay.
-Oh, boy.

113
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,777
Well, no judgements, babe.
He's a straight hottie.

114
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,904
<i>You want to smash Jason, go smash.</i>

115
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:06,115
Tahani getting together with Jason,
even casually,

116
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,660
could tear this group apart.
We have to nip this in the bud.

117
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,371
Well, it makes me slightly uneasy
to interfere

118
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,916
in the personal life of the man
that I am secretly in love with

119
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,920
and a woman I admire, but if you think
we should, I'm not gonna argue.

120
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,589
Time to break out
the ol' snowplow again, Janet.

121
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,718
Let's find Tahani a loving,
supportive companion.

122
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,636
Great idea.

123
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,971
You know,
this is not as crucial to the mission,

124
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,225
but I'd also love to arrange for them
to get better computers.

125
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,476
Help them work faster.

126
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,685
If I'm going to the mall anyway,

127
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,021
I might as well pick
Jason up some jean shorts,

128
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,733
the kind with the frayed edges, where you
can see the pockets coming out the bottom?

129
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,737
So that he can study better.

130
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,864
Sure.

131
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,950
[indistinct chatter]

132
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,078
Tahani? Is that you?

133
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,124
Larry Hemsworth? My goodness!

134
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,084
That's so funny,
I just got a call from the restaurant

135
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,003
about a jacket I left here,
and now here you are!

136
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,088
[both chuckle]

137
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,798
I can't believe you remember me.

138
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,092
Of course I remember you.
We dated.

139
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,970
I know, I just never expect
anyone to remember me.

140
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,723
Because I'm only 6'4"
and I have one of those forgettable faces.

141
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,144
Well, uh, I'm sure you're busy,
probably don't want to talk to me.

142
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,146
I get it. I wouldn't either,
I'm as dull as a rock.

143
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,940
Ugh! Even that analogy was boring.

144
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,068
I'm sorry, I'm so dull and I'm ugly,
I'm like a rock. [groans]

145
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,320
Stupid Larry! Stop talking about rocks!

146
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,532
No, no, no, Larry, please!
It's lovely to see you.

147
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:33,327
Sit down. Let's catch up!
How are Chris, and Liam and Luke?

148
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,787
-[Larry sighs]
-Sorry.

149
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,873
No, I won't mention
your brothers again.

150
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
As long as you don't mention my sister!

151
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,793
-Oh! [chuckles]
-[Tahani laughs]

152
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,879
[Janet] Mmm-mmm!

153
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,089
Who are you?
Do you work here?

154
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,258
Your name is Montgomery Wycoff.

155
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,803
Your ex-wife Samantha still loves you,
but she's afraid to call.

156
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:55,766
You must show her your poetry.
Go to her. Go to her!

157
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,732
{\an8}-Looks like you had a good night!
-I did.

158
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,736
You and Jason, imagine that.

159
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,529
To be fair, I have.

160
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,948
Actually, I was with an ex-boyfriend.

161
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:15,870
I ran into him unexpectedly
and the reunion was a smashing success.

162
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,541
-It's a pun, you see. We had intercourse.
-Yeah, again, I always get it.

163
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,043
I do feel bad, though.

164
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,253
I completely forgot about watching
the game with Jason.

165
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,172
Homies, guess what?

166
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,798
Yesterday, I got a Facebook invite

167
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,469
to the Australia chapter
of the Jacksonville Jaguars fan club!

168
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,845
Yeah, I think he's over it.

169
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,724
Me and two other dudes just watched
the Jags annihilate the Texans.

170
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,392
It was super fun!

171
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,811
I'm completely wasted.
I gotta go barf one last time,

172
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,356
and then I'll be ready
to learn philosophy!

173
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,025
<i>Duval!</i>

174
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,778
Okay, not perfect,
but the pros outweigh the cons.

175
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,695
Agreed.

176
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:55,076
{\an8}[all] <i>Happy birthday, dear Chidi...</i>

177
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,120
{\an8}You guys, this whole year
has been amazing for all of us.

178
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,290
I mean, literally every aspect
of our lives has improved.

179
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,210
Well, I don't know about every aspect.

180
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,503
SuperBoard, activate!

181
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,338
[automated voice speaking]
<i>Good morning, Professor Anagonye.</i>

182
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,757
<i>I have your lesson plan ready to go.</i>

183
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,010
SuperBoard, some triumphant
announcement music, please.

184
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,429
[fanfare playing]

185
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,598
Last night, Larry Hemsworth proposed to me

186
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,934
and we're moving back to London
to begin planning the wedding!

187
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,061
-Holy smokes!
-[Simone and Jason exclaim]

188
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:26,107
Janet! Red alert!
All snowplowing has to stop immediately.

189
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,734
So, don't give Blake Beartles to Jason?

190
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,491
How are you even
lugging this thing around?

191
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,535
I'm not sure I could
bench this much weight.

192
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,330
Well, girls in my social class
begin ring-training at a very young age.

193
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,334
Oh, I'm throwing a little engagement party
tonight at my Airbnb.

194
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,878
It's very last minute.
Come as you are.

195
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,677
I guess all these people...
came as they were?

196
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,264
Hello, everyone. I'm so glad you made it.

197
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,892
Holy crap, Tahani,
you found this place on Airbnb?

198
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,146
Oh, no. [chuckles]
I see why you're confused.

199
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,232
I used Heirbnb. "H-E-I-R."

200
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,736
It's an app for heirs and heiresses
where we swap mansions,

201
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,989
private islands, blimp hangars,
that sort of thing.

202
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:19,785
Anyway, everyone,
I want you to meet Larry Hemsworth.

203
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,413
Oh! The legendary study group.

204
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,958
I'm sorry it's taken me so long
to build up the courage to meet you.

205
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,628
I guess you can see why.

206
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:33,716
Is he ashamed at having a perfect jawline
and zero percent body fat?

207
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,384
Still can't believe she wants to marry me.

208
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,804
A dumb, old pediatric surgeon
who barely has an eight-pack.

209
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,891
Do you know what you look like?

210
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:46,228
More importantly, did Miley Cyrus
write the song "Wrecking Ball"

211
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,438
about Chris' brother Liam?

212
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,273
Wonderful.

213
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,859
More questions about my talented brothers.

214
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,362
God forbid there's a single day
when I'm the special one.

215
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,032
Sweetheart, don't go!
You're important, too!

216
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,077
Fixing babies' spines
is just as valuable as acting.

217
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,205
Tahani booked a flight
for tomorrow morning

218
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,625
so this party is our only chance
to talk them out of moving.

219
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,919
Maybe we should just let them
go their separate ways

220
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,254
and hope that they learned enough
to get into the Good Place.

221
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,965
No, we know what'll happen.
If the group splits up, they're screwed.

222
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,134
No, we have to isolate Larry

223
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,304
and convince him
that he needs to stay in Australia.

224
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:24,392
Time to get into character
as Nathaniel Cookswell, mate!

225
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,227
Caterer to the stars!

226
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,186
Huh...

227
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,730
Maybe no accent?

228
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,274
Fine.

229
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,985
Vegemite canapÃ©?

230
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,782
Might as well. Mummy was right.
I'll always be the chubby one.

231
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:45,413
Good day, mate.
Nathaniel Cookswell, caterer to the stars.

232
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,998
Is it true you're moving to England?

233
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,959
Yeah. Fly out tomorrow.

234
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,794
Oh, that's a long trip.

235
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,131
Well, you must be a confident man,
uprooting your life like that.

236
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,091
You should stay here in Sydney.

237
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,512
It's such a dynamic, international city
that you've only seen 4.8% of...

238
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,722
probably.

239
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,810
I reckon I know what's going on here.
You aren't real caterers, are you?

240
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,186
[both stutter]

241
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,981
Who do you work for? <i>Australian Inquirer? </i>

242
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,235
TMZ? You just want us to stay here
so you can keep mocking me.

243
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,904
"The hideous shame
of the Hemsworth family."

244
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,073
-[Janet] Oh.
-Tahani sees through all that.

245
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,660
And I can't wait until we move
far away from the likes of you,

246
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,996
and I can finally take her last name.

247
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,418
Hate to say it, but the group
probably needs a new member.

248
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,628
I don't know how
we'll ever replace Tahani.

249
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,214
Do you think Margot Robbie's
into philosophy?

250
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,884
Actually, Tahani's announcement
made us take stock.

251
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:44,638
You know, Simone and I need time
to analyze the data, apply for grants.

252
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,515
We've kind of hit
a natural stopping point.

253
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,477
Yeah, and the next step would be to repeat
the experiment with new subjects,

254
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,686
you know, compare results.

255
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:55,691
Wait, what are you saying?
That the study's over? We're splitting up?

256
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,738
No, no, no. We're just taking a break,
for a year or so.

257
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,449
And I'm sure you're all anxious
to get back home.

258
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,453
Yeah, I got a lot of stuff
to get back to in Phoenix. [scoffs]

259
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:12,333
Like... I have a free punch-card
at my spray tan place.

260
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,420
They'll do my left side for free, so...

261
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,259
No, no, no, no!
The whole group is splintering!

262
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,429
Okay, new emergency plan.
I'll deal with Eleanor.

263
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,432
I know it's risky,
but I don't think she'll recognize me.

264
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,186
And I'll deal with Sweet Cheeks.
I mean, Jason's butt. I mean, Jason.

265
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,395
[sighs]

266
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,028
-Shrimp?
-[Eleanor] Always.

267
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,199
[Michael] So...
how do you know Miss Al-Jamil?

268
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,576
You work with her at the university?

269
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,828
Used to. That study is done-zo.

270
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,998
And I was finally starting
to figure things out,

271
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:58,504
and now I have to start over
from scratch. Again.

272
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,799
Boy, I know how that goes.
Not wanting something to end.

273
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,843
Feeling like your little team
is the last thing

274
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,763
standing between you and oblivion,

275
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,100
that at any moment
the universe could fold up around you

276
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,812
and squeeze the last breath
from your dying lungs.

277
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,231
You're a caterer, right?

278
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,358
It's a very competitive industry.

279
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:23,070
The point is, I bet that if the study
means that much to you,

280
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,239
it means a lot to everyone else.

281
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,784
You're all just probably waiting
for someone to say it out loud.

282
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,705
You want some cocktail sauce with that?

283
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,206
[glass tinkling]

284
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,420
I would like to acknowledge the wonderful
group of people who brought me here.

285
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,380
If I hadn't decided
to get out of the spotlight

286
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:46,719
of my "Get Out of the Spotlight" tour,
and come here and join the Brainy Bunch,

287
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,179
I never would have reconnected with Larry.

288
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,097
[crowd exclaims]

289
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,936
So, to celebrate our group,
I had my favorite pÃ¢tissier whip this up!

290
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,229
[chuckles]

291
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,106
Would any of you like to say a few words?

292
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,983
Eleanor!

293
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,693
Yay, Eleanor!

294
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,987
If nobody minds, uh...

295
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:10,409
I would like to address...
the people on this cake, I suppose.

296
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,247
I get that we all have
meaningful lives outside the study.

297
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,751
Well, Tahani and Chidi do.
Jason and I are straight trash.

298
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,919
Ka-kaw!

299
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,088
But just think about
how much progress we've all made

300
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,632
since that picture was taken.

301
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:30,095
I know that what we're doing is important
and I'm not ready to stop.

302
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,057
And I don't think you guys are, either.

303
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:38,854
So, let's all stay here and keep it going.
What do you say?

304
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:44,151
Eleanor, that was absolutely lovely.

305
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,903
[Chidi] It really was. And I am...

306
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,489
I'm so glad that this study
meant that much to you.

307
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,534
-But, realistically--
-That's cool. I get it.

308
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,245
No, you don't need to say it. I got it.
That's all she wrote. Cool.

309
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,750
-Are you okay? I hope you're not mad.
-No, I'm not mad. I'm actually laughing.

310
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:04,588
Because this whole study was a hilarious,
stupid, pointless joke,

311
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,590
and now it's over, so let's hit the road.

312
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,592
I don't need you guys.
You don't need me.

313
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,177
And since you don't need me,

314
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,013
I'm just gonna take the me
out of this cake.

315
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,600
-[crowd gasps]
-No, no! Eleanor, please!

316
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,561
Sorry, the deed is done!
Pip pip, too late!

317
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,271
Farewell to you, my liege.

318
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,150
And a jolly good
Saint Ploopington's Day to all of you!

319
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,697
USA! USA! USA!

320
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,454
Eleanor? Is that you?

321
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,872
[Eleanor] No.

322
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,711
Called a cab, like, 20 minutes ago.

323
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:48,173
It says it's ten kilometers away,
which is... I don't even know how far.

324
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,009
It's a little over six miles.

325
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:54,596
Is that why you came out here?
To scold me about the metric system?

326
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,392
No, I was about to call a cab myself.
I have an early class tomorrow.

327
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,562
Then I saw my friend hiding behind a plant
and I got concerned.

328
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,313
Then my friend lashed out at me again,

329
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:07,026
so I'm gonna take off and leave her here
with dirty leaves in her hair.

330
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,696
Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Don't go.

331
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,453
You're a brain scientist.

332
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,873
Can you tell me why I did that in there?

333
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,167
I mostly do clinical research
in neuroscience.

334
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,377
I don't really specialize
in temper tantrums.

335
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,797
Maybe you need a child psychologist...
or a binkie.

336
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,091
That's a solid burn.
I deserved it. I did.

337
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:35,054
But, please, can you help me?
Why did I do that?

338
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,222
Okay, here's my guess.

339
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,602
As humans evolved, the first big problem
we had to overcome was "me versus us."

340
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:45,355
Learning to sacrifice a little individual
freedom for the benefit of a group.

341
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,816
You know, like sharing food and resources

342
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,402
so we don't starve or get eaten by tigers,
things like that.

343
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,529
Okay, with you so far.

344
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,699
The next problem to overcome was
"us versus them."

345
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,577
Trying to see other groups
different from ours as equals.

346
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,579
That one we're still struggling with.

347
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,665
That's why we have racism,
and nationalism and...

348
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,710
why fans of Stone Cold Steve Austin
hate fans of The Rock.

349
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,254
No! We hate The Rock
because he went Hollywood

350
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,424
and Stone Cold keeps it real,
so The Rock's fans are the real jabronis.

351
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,927
Point made, keep going.

352
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,096
Well, what's interesting about you is...

353
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,308
I don't think you ever got past
the "me versus us" stage.

354
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,561
I mean, have you ever been part
of a group that you really cared about?

355
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,855
-I was in the Girl Scouts.
-Really?

356
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,817
Technically, I joined under a fake name,

357
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,610
because I wanted to steal
a bunch of cookies.

358
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,613
See? The Brainy Bunch is
basically the first group

359
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,989
that became part of your self identity,

360
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,660
and now that's breaking up,
you're feeling this new kind of loss.

361
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,662
And you're scared of going back
to being alone.

362
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,413
I mean, that's just my guess.

363
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,416
The other possible medical diagnosis
is that you're just a bit of a dick.

364
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,293
[both chuckle]

365
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,631
[Eleanor] Why don't you take my cab?

366
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:57,469
I think "me" needs to go
apologize to "us." And thank you.

367
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:04,351
The point is,
I'm not really an "I'm sorry" type girl.

368
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:08,021
I'm more of a "It's your fault
your car got keyed

369
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,022
in the movie theater parking lot,

370
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,485
because you wouldn't shut up
while watching <i>John Wick" </i>type girl.

371
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:18,532
But I'm sorry that I freaked out.
Just really gonna miss you guys.

372
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,576
We're gonna miss you, too.

373
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,788
Here's an idea.
What if we all agree to a yearly reunion?

374
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,874
And then that way,
the Brainy Bunch never dies.

375
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,919
Each summer, we could all stay
in one of our respective houses,

376
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,547
mega-yachts, ski chalets, what have you.

377
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,092
We should all meet up in Jacksonville!
My house is right on the water.

378
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,135
It didn't used to be,

379
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,388
but the whole city is a swamp
and it's sinking into the ocean.

380
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,015
Whoo! Strong pitch, bud.

381
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,350
-Next year in Jacksonville!
-Yeah!

382
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,229
{\an8}We might not want to wait a whole year.
It's sinking really fast.

383
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,981
{\an8}-We should have a toast.
-[exhales sharply]

384
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,526
{\an8}Okay, I think I figured out a plan
where they stay in Australia,

385
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,529
{\an8}and only five random bystanders get hurt.

386
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,990
{\an8}It's called arson.
Let's go!

387
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,035
{\an8}Michael, no.
We can't keep meddling forever.

388
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,370
{\an8}It's time to park the snowplow

389
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,165
{\an8}and trust that the humans
will make progress on their own.

390
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,084
{\an8}This isn't like your afterlife
neighborhood, Michael.

391
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,045
{\an8}You can't just reset things

392
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,339
{\an8}the moment something doesn't go
according to your plan.

393
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,051
Oh, Janet, you're a genius.

394
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,802
Correct. I know everything.

395
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,971
You just gave me this crazy idea.

396
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,891
It's so crazy, it just might... fail.
It'll probably fail.

397
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,392
But it also might work.

398
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,853
I open the door to the afterlife.

399
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,273
You keep a lookout
while I break into the Judge's chamber

400
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,317
and reset the timeline on Earth.

401
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,736
We do it all over again, but correctly.

402
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,738
We won't wait a year
to get them all together again.

403
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,406
We'll get the study going right away!

404
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,700
But do you even know how to reset
the timeline on Earth?

405
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:49,414
[sighs] No. I'm assuming that there's
a knob, or a button or, you know...

406
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,000
maybe you unplug it
and then plug it right back in?

407
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,127
I don't... There's gotta be a way!

408
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,005
-Michael, before you do this--
-No! No more waiting.

409
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,924
This is all we have, Janet.

410
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:04,388
We have Chidi, and Eleanor,
and Tahani and Jason, and that is it.

411
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,932
If we can't get them
enough afterlife points

412
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,433
to get them into the Good Place,

413
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,020
then there's no point in us
even being here. We have to try.

414
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,232
-Okay. Let's do this.
-Yeah, okay.

415
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,029
What the hell is that?

416
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,783
Oh! Hey, guys!
What are you doing down here?
