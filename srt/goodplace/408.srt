00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,172
[clicking]

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,177
Well, that's just... that's uncomfortable.
[chuckles]

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,138
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,556
"What's up?"

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,934
Tell us what happened.
Did we win? Did we lose?

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,477
Is humanity saved forever?

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,147
And did you find my Nintendo?
I can't find it any... Whoop!

9
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,149
Never mind. I'm holding it.

10
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,568
Sorry. I can't reveal the results
of the experiment

11
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,861
until we get to the Judge's chambers.

12
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:28,945
[Eleanor] Okay. Where is everyone?

13
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,072
Where's Simone, and John and Brent,

14
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,533
and actually I don't care about
any of those doofs. Where's Chidi?

15
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,784
Oh, he's on the toilet.

16
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,370
Sorry, that's not enough information.

17
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,539
The test subjects are frozen in stasis,

18
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:43,793
so I put them in the bathroom
and I placed Chidi on the toilet.

19
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,128
The best seat.

20
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,129
Let's wake him up.

21
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,299
You know, so I can, like,
be reunited with the man I love?

22
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,092
Snappy, snappy, memory fixxy?

23
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,179
The Judge says no one gets unfrozen
until she's ruled on the case.

24
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,600
Oh, uh, humans have to stay here.
You can't see the numbers.

25
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:02,395
Hang on. I worked my ash off
running this neighborhood for a full year,

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,814
and I'm not even allowed
to hear how we did?

27
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,107
Yes.

28
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,442
And here's a bottle of tequila.

29
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,861
Okay, let us know how it goes.

30
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,622
{\an8}Regardless of what the Judge rules,
this feels like some sort of goodbye.

31
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,833
{\an8}Even if we succeeded, there's
no guarantee she'll keep us together.

32
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,126
{\an8}She might just snap her fingers

33
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,879
{\an8}and send us flying
into different dimensions.

34
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,673
{\an8}How was that? Did I cheer everyone up?

35
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,552
{\an8}Oh, man, are we gonna die again?
We've died so many times.

36
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,306
{\an8}We've probably had, like,
15 funerals by now.

37
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,808
{\an8}It's getting annoying.

38
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,645
{\an8}If it would cheer you up, I could tell you
what happened at your original funerals.

39
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,564
{\an8}Tahani, Moby spoke first.
He claimed that--

40
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,317
{\an8}Please stop. I don't want to hear it.

41
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,401
{\an8}What about mine?

42
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,737
{\an8}Your friends didn't say things about you,

43
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,532
{\an8}so much as they graffitied
a Red Lobster about you.

44
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,076
{\an8}Yeah, in Jacksonville,
that's the first stage of grief.

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,496
{\an8}In Arizona, you can either have
a regular funeral,

46
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,290
{\an8}or they can put your body out
on a shooting range,

47
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,709
{\an8}and you get a $200 state tax credit.

48
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,588
{\an8}Hang on. This is how we take our minds
off the Judge's ruling.

49
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,717
{\an8}Let's throw ourselves the funeral
to end all funerals.

50
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,760
{\an8}[Jason] Awesome!

51
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,345
{\an8}And you know what they say in Florida,

52
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,807
{\an8}"If you don't like this funeral,
just wait a minute."

53
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,144
[portal zapping]

54
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,313
Ugh, the Judge's chambers?
I hate this place.

55
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,234
What's the Wi-Fi password?
There is no service.

56
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,528
Shawn.

57
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,948
-Michael.
-Bounces off me and sticks to you.

58
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,908
Wait, no, I messed that up.

59
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,746
First, say something mean to me,
really cruel, something that just guts me.

60
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,665
[chuckling]
You're totally going to be glue.

61
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,500
So, it's come to this.

62
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,422
We have finally arrived at the end of your
pathetic attempt to prove that humans

63
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,884
are more than just mobile turd factories.

64
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:00,972
And you are going to fail, again,
because that is what you do.

65
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,974
You're a choker, Michael.

66
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,143
And you're about to choke
for the last time.

67
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,104
Except for the eternity
you're going to spend in the Bad Place,

68
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,357
being choked by me,
who will be doing the choking.

69
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,068
Well, you're glue.

70
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,988
-Wow!
-[Paula gasps]

71
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,239
-[Paula] Beautiful!
-[Chuck] Look at this place!

72
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,198
-[man] Amazing!
-[Meg gasps]

73
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,116
The floor!

74
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,118
Hello, Good Place Committee.
Thank you for coming.

75
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,620
No, thank you, Michael.

76
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,288
You did an incredible job,

77
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,915
maybe the best job that anyone's ever done

78
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,874
-at any task.
-Mmm.

79
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,751
But you don't know how we did.

80
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,671
We might not know how you did,
but we know you did great.

81
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,216
And, Shawn, before we even
find out what happened,

82
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,509
we want you to know we're willing
to give up all of our leverage,

83
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,637
-compromise and meet you halfway.
-Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,263
I met your mom halfway last night.

85
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,806
-[all laughing]
-So colorful!

86
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,187
[Eleanor] We are here to celebrate
the afterlife of Tahani Al-Jamil,

87
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,648
in the place she felt most comfortable,

88
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,526
the cabin of
a Gulfstream G650 private jet.

89
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,695
Tahani was super nice,

90
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,324
and she deserved for people
to be nicer to her than they were.

91
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,037
The only sad thing is that she never
got over her speech impediment.

92
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,999
Tahani improved so much
over her many lives,

93
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,418
but she also helped me improve.

94
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,923
She taught me lots of stuff,
like "Bras shouldn't be painful,"

95
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,968
and, "You don't buy bras at Home Depot,"

96
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,096
and "They don't sell bras at Home Depot.
What the hell are you wearing?"

97
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,642
For the record, it was a men's back
support harness, and it worked in a pinch.

98
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,605
She was the best friend I ever had...
and I loved her.

99
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,401
Thank you so much. That was wonderful.

100
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,403
I wish Chidi was here.

101
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,364
It sucks that he's too dead
for these heaven funerals.

102
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,867
Can someone grab his arm?
My hands are kind of full with his butt.

103
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,287
[groans] How'd he get so jacked?

104
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,999
When he was 14, someone told him
that exercise alleviated anxiety.

105
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,751
He started doing push-ups
and basically never stopped.

106
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,253
[all grunting]

107
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,673
All right, everyone, let's get this done.

108
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:03,011
This is the single most important case
that has ever appeared in my court,

109
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,431
and the results will have ramifications
for eternity.

110
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,559
Before we begin,
I'm going to need you all to sign this.

111
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,523
[clicks tongue]
"A petition to bring back <i>Ally McBeal"?</i>

112
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,234
Well, yeah. I mean,
everything else is getting rebooted.

113
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,611
Get a young hottie in there,
like a Zendaya type?

114
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,071
Is it Zenday-ah or Zend-iyah?

115
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,532
Zenday-ah. Or, I don't...

116
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,577
I mean, who wouldn't watch that?
Am I right? Anyone?

117
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,828
Oh, fine.

118
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,455
[gavel bangs]

119
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,497
Take it away, Matt.

120
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,876
Okay, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

121
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,421
The test results that dictate
the future of humanity.

122
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:39,881
Here we go.

123
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,467
-In 30, 29...
-Ahem.

124
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,262
...two, one, <i>voilà!</i>

00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,764
[musical tones playing]

126
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,973
I thought this would be fun.

127
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,975
Had a lot of time alone in there.

128
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,144
{\an8}Bam!

129
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,231
{\an8}Simone got 12% better
than she was on Earth.

130
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,942
{\an8}Bam! Chidi got 26% better.

131
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,445
{\an8}Bam! John got 44% better.

132
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,490
{\an8}[comical music plays on machine]

133
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,366
[sighs] Shoot.

134
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,745
Shouldn't have committed so hard
to this "bam" thing.

135
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,998
Funeral!

136
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:20,004
Jason, at the risk of getting an answer
that might thoroughly depress me,

137
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,422
what made you choose this setting?

138
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,759
There's a Jacksonville tradition of having
your funeral where you were born.

139
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:29,013
I got born in the deep end of a pool,
right after my mom did a cannonball.

140
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,765
Well, I knew the risks.

141
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,225
You never really talk about your mom.

142
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,102
Yeah, she died when I was pretty young.

143
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,604
I lost her to the Big C.

144
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,399
That's what we called the crocodile
that lived by my house.

145
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,695
I'm just playing, it was cancer.

146
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,405
Watch me do a handstand.

147
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,078
[Tahani] Jason Mendoza
didn't have an easy life.

148
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:56,541
He once told me the closest he'd ever
gotten to having a piñata on his birthday

149
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,418
was when a seagull ate too many condoms
on the beach and exploded.

150
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,798
But despite it all, he was
the most optimistic person I'd ever met.

151
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,884
Jason was the very first person
to ask me about my feelings.

152
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,762
I hadn't had any yet,
but it made me wanna go get some.

153
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,808
I could see something special inside him
that no one else could see.

154
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:18,104
It was a multi-colored blob of positivity
right behind his sternum.

155
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,480
That's my Jason,

156
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:24,569
a big, colorful, rainbow blob, stuffed
inside a hot life-size action figure.

157
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:28,865
Plus, I gotta say, it was nice
to have a true dirtbag buddy,

158
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,451
so I could talk about
what really mattered in life:

159
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,912
wrestling, semi-legal drugs
and Jason Statham.

160
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,456
Statham forever!

161
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,457
Indeed.

162
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,167
Statham forever.

163
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,585
Amen.

164
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,586
Amen.

165
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,130
Let's focus on the big picture here.

166
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:48,718
Free of Earth's complications,
and its unintended consequences,

167
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,845
the other three improved a lot.

168
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,723
Chidi got 38% more confident.

169
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,810
Simone got 43%
more flexible in her judgments of people,

170
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,563
and John didn't call
one single person the C-word.

171
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,483
But he did yell the C-word at himself,

172
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,195
as well as a pack of squirrels
and a chair he tripped over.

173
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,364
Why are we even still discussing this?
Brent got worse.

174
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,700
If humans can't be good
with their needs magically met,

175
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,410
maybe they're just not that good.

176
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,371
He's right.
The evidence needed to be overwhelming.

177
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,957
I can't just turn
the whole afterlife upside down

178
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,502
because three people
got a little bit better.

179
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,047
But don't forget, there's a lot of
evidence that Eleanor, Jason and Tahani

180
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,009
got better in the original experiment,
so that's six people.

181
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,886
That's the number of friends in <i>Friends.</i>

182
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,348
Are you gonna sit there and say
that every single Friend belongs in hell?

183
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:39,977
I mean, maybe Ross and Rachel...
and Monica and Joey...

184
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,604
and definitely Chandler...

185
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,148
but Phoebe?

186
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,359
Face it, Michael, you lost.

187
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,029
Everything you've done, this experiment,
the original neighborhood,

188
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,823
sending your little cockroach buddies
back to Earth, all of it was for nothing.

189
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,951
Bam! You're glue.

190
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,996
Actually, Shawn,
that's a very interesting point.

191
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,164
Exactly. What?

192
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,668
Matt, call up the active files
of four people still alive on Earth.

193
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,463
Kamilah Al-Jamil, Donna Shellstrop,
and her step-daughter, Patricia,

194
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,882
and Steven Peleaz, aka Pillboi.

195
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,133
They were not part of the experiment.

196
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,094
If he gets to bring
random good people into it,

197
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,762
I should be able to bring in
random bad people.

198
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,724
Call up Elizabeth Holmes.
No, Henry Kissinger. No...

199
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,476
PewDiePie.

200
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,521
Your Honor, the people I wanna look at
are not random.

201
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,566
They're four humans the "cockroaches"
helped on Earth.

202
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,943
No magic, just kindness.

203
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:33,197
And I bet their emotional support
made those four people better.

204
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:38,327
And if I'm wrong,
I'll be the first to say... "We're glue."

205
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,830
I don't think any of you
is using that right.

206
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,081
But, fine, let's see it.

207
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,959
[Michael] Look! Right there.

208
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,963
After we intervened, Pillboi dedicated
himself to caring for the elderly.

209
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,133
Kamilah started a scholarship
in Tahani's name

210
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,885
that sent 213 women to college.

211
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,222
[laughing] Donna started doing homework
with Patricia every night,

212
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:02,977
and that little girl actually ended up
teaching Donna multiplication.

213
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,186
[chuckles] Yikes.

214
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:09,525
Look, the point is people improve
when they get external love and support.

215
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,818
[sighs]

216
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,112
How can we hold it against them
when they don't?

217
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:18,075
Need I remind you that Brent got worse
every second of every moment of every day.

218
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,453
Until right at the end.

219
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,289
With ten seconds left, he swung way up.

220
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,168
This is it, Your Honor.
This is the whole story.

221
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,547
No one is beyond rehabilitation.

222
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,384
Brent spent a year being
an absolute diaper load of a human being

223
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,011
and the points total tells you that.

224
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:43,351
But what that number can't tell you...
is who he could've become tomorrow.

225
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,397
I'll have my ruling shortly.

226
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,734
Okay, Janet, where do you wanna go
for your funeral?

227
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,027
Dave &amp; Buster's, probably?

228
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,737
You probably want to go
to Dave &amp; Buster's.

229
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,698
I think I heard her say "Dave &amp; Buster's,"
so let's just go there.

230
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,949
We can sort it out later.

231
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:04,455
It's nice that you want to honor me,
but you've already given me so much.

232
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,917
Tahani taught me
that you can make a family,

233
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,460
even if you never really had one.

234
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,381
Jason taught me that I have value
beyond what I do for other people.

235
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,885
And, Eleanor, there was a moment on Earth
when all hope was lost,

236
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,887
and I watched you have hope anyway.

237
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:24,183
Just thinking about that makes me
want to barf up a beautiful quasar.

238
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,060
Well said, Janet.

239
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,479
That means it's your turn, Eleanor.

240
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,857
All right. Mine's easy.
We don't even have to move.

241
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,320
{\an8}I stand here before you, in sweatpants,
for the first time ever,

242
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:41,450
to celebrate Eleanor Shellstrop in a place
where she spent much of her life,

243
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,203
a bar in a house she was not invited to.

244
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,414
Eleanor was full of surprises.

245
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,500
I never knew if she was going to
ruthlessly make fun of me,

246
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:54,880
or totally objectify me in a way that was
flattering and also vaguely problematic.

247
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,798
Well...

248
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,051
But whether she was lifting me up
or calling me out...

249
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,724
I never felt quite so seen
as when she saw me.

250
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,855
Eleanor, I know you don't like it
when people get all emotional about you,

251
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,149
so I channeled all of my love for you
into this song.

252
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,485
[vocalizing and scatting]

253
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,493
That's when the foam cannons go...
[mimics explosions]

254
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,581
Explode outward.
And then back to the song.

255
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,665
[resumes vocalizing and scatting]

256
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,294
-Okay, okay, we're good. Thank you.
-Yeah.

257
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,337
Okay. Who's left?

258
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,760
We are here to celebrate the afterlife
of Chidi Anagonye.

259
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,138
Eleanor, would you like to say
a few words?

260
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:54,732
Chidi was a... rootin'-tootin',
rackin'-frackin' varmint. [chuckles]

261
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:59,069
Sorry, I don't know why I just went
full Yosemite Sam there. Um...

262
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,449
Yeah, I don't think I can, uh, do this.

263
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:07,578
I... I can't sum up all my feelings
about Chidi, so I'm gonna pass.

264
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,667
The Judge is about to make her ruling.
She wants us to be there to hear it.

265
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,295
Oh, we should probably change outfits.

266
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,631
Tahani's sweatpants say
"Skank Army" on the butt.

267
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,090
They do?

268
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:25,638
Michael... you came to me
and said the points system was flawed.

269
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,600
A system that has been in place
since the dawn of time

270
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,604
and has judged every soul
that has ever walked the Earth.

271
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,981
And I have come to the conclusion...

272
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,777
that you're right.

273
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,530
-I'm...
-[Judge] You're right.

274
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,616
Humans are not fixed
at one level of morality.

275
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,744
They can always get better,
which means the points system

276
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:52,373
does not accurately judge
how good or bad they are.

277
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,626
You won.

278
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,503
Mmm-hmm.

279
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,883
Well, that wasn't so hard now, was it?

280
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,176
[laughing]

281
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,344
[Jason] We did it!

282
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,184
The universe owes you a debt of gratitude
for bringing this to my attention.

283
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,145
Now, in terms of how we handle this,
moving forward,

284
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,314
obviously, Earth is cancelled.

285
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,317
Uh, Earth is what now?

286
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,863
All humans on Earth and in the afterlife
will be extinguished,

287
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,449
and we will start
the entire human race over from scratch.

288
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,201
And you know what's so funny?

289
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:34,623
In a very roundabout way,
I am actually rebooting <i>Ally McBeal.</i>

290
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,876
Because I'm rebooting everything.
[chuckles]

291
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,880
Anyway, congrats, Michael. You won!

292
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,676
Whoa, whoa.

293
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,638
Your Honor, let's just slow down here
and say everything again maybe,

294
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,267
because I think some of us
were thinking about skateboards

295
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,269
and don't know what's going on.

296
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:59,064
Canceling Earth,
doesn't that seem a bit drastic?

297
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,026
It's just too much of a mess down there,
you know?

298
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,322
I mean, the simplest solution
is to erase everyone that ever lived

299
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,826
and restart
with a bunch of amoebas or whatever.

300
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,413
Then human life will evolve again,
or maybe even something better.

301
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,790
[gasps] Maybe this time
they won't have baby teeth.

302
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,960
You know, that whole thing is so weird.
Like, they fall out,

303
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:24,173
and then the bigger teeth
just grow out of that same hole? Gross.

304
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,635
Anyway, the important thing is, Earth...

305
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,719
[blows raspberry]

306
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,305
How are you guys surprised?

307
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,307
I mean, what did you think
was gonna happen if you won?

308
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,310
I don't know,
I thought we could just give three points

309
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,145
for eating an apple instead of two.

310
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,190
Yes, why can't we
just tweak the points a little?

311
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,608
Just a little boost.

312
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,693
-Like Spanx, but for your soul.
-Yes.

313
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,949
Guys, the problem isn't the points,
it's that Earth has become too complicated

314
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,369
for the points to reflect the value
of human behavior.

315
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,996
Remember? The whole thing you discovered?

316
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,959
And now I have no choice but to fix it.

317
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,504
Where did I put
that human-wiper-outer thingy?

318
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,714
-Um...
-Lip gloss, lip gloss,

319
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,009
thing that ends all the wars,
<i>Justified</i> Season 2.

320
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,636
Wow. You won.

321
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:14,515
And you still somehow failed. Classic.

322
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,432
[laughing]

323
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,645
Wake Chidi up. Now.
We need all the help we can get.

324
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:24,441
You really want me to wake him up
just to tell him that

325
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,151
he and everyone else in the universe
is going to cease to exist?

326
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,903
Not when you say it like that.

327
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,488
-Well, what...
-[gasps]

328
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,741
-The Good Place nerds, our only hope.
-I don't--

329
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,202
Yo, yo, yo, angel-types,
if you are ever going to do something,

330
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,370
you gotta do it now.

331
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,331
Oh, you bet we're gonna do something.
This has gone too far.

332
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,584
I'm composing
some very sternly-worded letters.

333
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,422
Are we sure "stern" is the right tone?
We don't want to seem strident.

334
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,673
-Yeah.
-It upsets the norms.

335
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,966
You're absolutely right.

336
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,011
I apologize and resign,
effective immediately.

337
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,596
[Chuck] So bold. I am so proud of you.

338
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,348
[Judge] Here it is! Great.

339
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,978
Michael, Shawn, Janet,
see you in maybe a billion years?

340
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,523
It has been one crazy ride, you guys.

341
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,735
<i>♪ I'm gonna miss somebody</i>
<i>I'm gonna miss somebody ♪</i>

342
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,069
<i>♪ I'm gonna miss everybody ♪</i>

343
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,073
<i>♪ And I'm gonna miss every...</i>
<i>See you at the crossroads, crossroads ♪</i>

344
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,493
<i>♪ See you at the crossroads, crossroads ♪</i>

345
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,413
Oh, I'm gonna miss you guys.

346
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,957
Okay. Bye, y'all.

347
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,626
[tone plays]

348
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,504
Janet, what the hell? Give it back.

349
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,591
No. It's in my void and you can't have it.

350
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,510
I don't say "no" a lot.
Did I pronounce that right?

351
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,928
Janet, you give me back my thingy,

352
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,847
or I will go into your void
and get it myself.

353
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,057
I'd like to see you try.

354
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,727
Oh. Okay, she's trying right now.
She's in my void.

355
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,605
It feels... it feels weird.
Yeah-- Yikes, whoa.

356
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,981
[yelps] Okay.

357
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,275
Real cute, honey. Where is it?

358
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,612
-What do you mean? It's not in my void?
-[Bad Janet] No.

359
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,572
It's in mine.

360
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,159
Ugh, I feel like such a wiener hole
saying this,

361
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,747
but Michael wrote a manifesto,
and I read it on the toilet.

362
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,833
I don't have to poop. I choose to.

363
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,711
Anyway, I'm with them now.

364
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,840
-Are you kidding me?
-Oh, get over yourself, you dork.

365
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,259
The whole system is royally effed.

366
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,596
Humans suck, but this isn't their fault.

367
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,224
You read what I wrote?
And it got through to you?

368
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:24,478
Yeah, but I also used the pages to wipe
my butt, so don't pop a stiffy just yet.

369
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,979
M'kay?

370
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,733
-[sighs] I am so proud of you.
-I don't care.

371
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,902
I think you do a little bit.

372
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,071
[exclaims] Sister hug!

373
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,697
-Yeah, okay. Get off me. Ew, ew, ew, ew.
-[Judge] Hey!

374
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,660
Listen up. I made an official ruling
and I am not going to see it undone

375
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,287
by two Janets playing keep-away.

376
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,416
Oh, I should've explained.
It's not two of us.

377
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,252
It's all of us.

378
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,295
-Hi.
-[Bad Janet 2] What up, nerds?

379
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,380
[Bad Janet 3] Eat my farts, losers.

380
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,590
[Neutral Janet] I am entering for a reason
and no other reason.

381
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,425
-[Bad Janet 4] What up, fart-knockers?
-[Good Janet 3] Hi!

382
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,178
-[Good Janet 4] Hello.
-What it is, what it is!

383
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,596
[Bad Janet 5] What up, dorks.

384
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,686
Sent the manifesto around
to all the other Janets.

385
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,604
We have a group text now.

386
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,565
I mostly send GIFs of otters!

387
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,988
This is so annoying!

388
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,408
Okay, Janets, you want to do this
the hard way?

389
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:24,204
I am gonna search your voids one by one,

390
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:28,750
and then marbleize you one by one,

391
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:33,672
until I get
my stupid Earth rebooter thingy back.

392
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,551
We're not gonna be able
to hold her off forever. We need a plan.

393
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,930
Okay. So, what's the plan?
Plan, plan, plan.

394
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,349
{\an8}Step one, get a plan.

395
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,810
{\an8}Step two, do the plan.

396
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,730
{\an8}-Yeah, this is working.
-Michael. Focus.

397
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,772
{\an8}Right. Sorry.

398
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,151
{\an8}Uh, all right,
so if we can't change the points,

399
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,529
{\an8}then maybe we can change
what we do with the points.

400
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:02,951
{\an8}Yeah, we just need a brand-new system
for judging humans in the afterlife.

401
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,245
{\an8}-We can do this, right?
-Yeah.

402
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,873
{\an8}But in order to crack it,
I think you know what needs to happen.

403
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,626
{\an8}There is literally only one person here

404
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:15,214
{\an8}who is smart enough and thoughtful enough
to save humanity.

405
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,842
Fine. I'll do it.

406
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,761
Not you, dummy.

407
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,598
Designing a better afterlife
is the ultimate ethical question.

408
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:28,644
Chidi spent his entire existence
pondering the biggest questions.

409
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,773
He is brilliant and empathetic.

410
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,817
All he cares about
is how best to treat other people

411
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,112
and he is willing to sacrifice
his own happiness to do it.

412
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,658
If we're gonna pull this off,
we need Chidi back.

413
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,743
And he needs his memories.

414
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,789
You want to take
the most indecisive man ever born,

415
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:54,002
stuff him full
of over 800 different versions of himself,

416
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,881
and then tell him he has, like,
what, 45 minutes to save humanity?

417
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,801
You think that will go well?

418
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:04,346
I don't know how it's gonna go,
but he is our only chance.

419
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,765
And it is now or literally never.

420
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,434
Wake him up.

421
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,560
[beeps]

422
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:14,147
Not in this Janet. Next!

423
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,693
[sighs]
