1
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,088
You gotta admit,

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,216
things are going pretty well
since I took over.

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,051
Certainly a lot smoother lately.

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:14,055
Based on my surveillance,
our four humans don't suspect anything.

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,433
Yeah, because we're killing it.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,976
[whoops]

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,227
You sure are.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,440
Here are the torture ideas
you asked me to write up for next week.

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,151
[groans] So long.

10
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,777
You're not supposed to be torturing me.

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,990
From now on, make all your memos
one page, max, with pictures.

12
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,702
Also, Quinston over here
already came up with a sick idea

13
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,163
for how to torture Tahani. Tell him, babe.

14
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,665
We're gonna have Tahani
throw a party for Gunnar's birthday.

15
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,085
But no one will show up,
because we'll also be throwing a party

16
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,795
and it will be way better!

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,921
Boom!

18
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,382
Where do you get these incredible ideas?

19
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,926
That one just came to me.
It popped into my noodle.

20
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,219
[Vicky] Yeah, that's right.

21
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,721
[all laughing]

22
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,222
Up top. Yeah!

23
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,515
That's their plan.

24
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,601
This doesn't seem so bad.

25
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,936
Yeah, it really tugs my nuggets.

26
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,982
I worked so hard on my torture ideas
and theirs are so basic.

27
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,193
These millennials,
they have no work ethic.

28
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,696
Oh, sorry, a millennial is someone

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,076
who's only been torturing people
for a thousand years. Millennial.

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,161
[theme music playing]

31
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,377
{\an8}Okay, coast is clear.
Not a demon in sight,

32
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,714
{\an8}except for, you know.
Is that what we should call you? "Demon"?

33
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,674
{\an8}Well, it's not really accurate

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,303
{\an8}and we consider it to be a little racist.
But it's fine.

35
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,723
{\an8}Well, let's start our first lesson.

36
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,892
{\an8}Tahani and Jason will have to make it up

37
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,102
{\an8}since they're both off
being fake tortured.

38
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:48,233
{\an8}I've read everything on your syllabus
and how do I put this delicately?

39
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,944
{\an8}It's all stupid garbage.

40
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:55,031
{\an8}Look, we have to start somewhere.
So how about Socrates?

41
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,159
{\an8}All right.
Let me get into the mindset of a human.

42
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,370
{\an8}[laughs] "Oh...

43
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,958
{\an8}I'm a human and my breathing tube
is next to my eating tube.

44
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,628
{\an8}And look, my arms end
in stupid little sticks."

45
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,131
{\an8}Okay, proceed.

46
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,382
{\an8}Good.

47
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,676
{\an8}This is so depressing.

48
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,679
{\an8}I'm being forced to throw a party
I know will fail.

49
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,889
{\an8}That's why they're doing this.
It's what you're best at.

50
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,976
{\an8}Just like I'm the best at getting
empty water bottles

51
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,602
{\an8}to stay on the roof of a Pizza Hut.

52
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,189
{\an8}You know what?
I am the best at planning parties.

53
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,859
{\an8}Vicky may be some demonic torturer
from the netherworld,

54
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,528
{\an8}but does she have taste, sophistication,

55
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,656
{\an8}an encyclopedic knowledge of traditional
and avant-garde Belgian floral designs?

56
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,616
Yes, she does!

57
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,870
No, she doesn't.

58
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,289
What if I throw a party so amazing

59
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,333
it's better than the party
that's supposed to win?

60
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,503
When they realize they could have
come to my party, they'll be sad.

61
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,464
I won't be sad. They'll be sad. Janet?

62
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,924
Hi, there.

63
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,926
Janet, when I turned 18,

64
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,137
I knelt in front of
Princess Grace's dress mausoleum

65
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,598
and I swore to uphold the Hostess Code,

66
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:06,603
"I, Tahani Al-Jamil,
shall do my level best

67
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,689
to make every event too much."

68
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,984
Model tonight's decor
after my 2008 fundraiser

69
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,611
for the Red Cross in Zürich.

70
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:18,072
No, 2007!

71
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,742
[chuckles]

72
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,290
[Eleanor] Man,
Michael is not into your class.

73
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,334
Right now, I'm the best student.

74
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,628
I'm gonna be the velociraptor.

75
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,048
-You trying to say valedictorian?
-No.

76
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,633
Dude, this isn't your fault.

77
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,468
You've been teaching him ethics
for half an hour

78
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,471
and he's been evil since
the beginning of time.

79
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,683
Oh! Maybe the reason Michael
can't latch onto the ideas

80
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,768
is because he's immortal.

81
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,938
If you live forever,
then ethics don't matter to you,

82
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,565
because, basically,
there's no consequences for your actions.

83
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,192
You tell a lie, who cares?

84
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,944
Wait a few trillion years,
the guilt will fade.

85
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,321
Before I can teach Michael to be good,

86
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,282
I have to force him to think about
what we used to think about.

87
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,912
That life has an end and, therefore,
our actions have meaning.

88
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,413
That's what you used to think about?

89
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,500
I used to think about
how it's weird they don't make pants

90
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,836
that are one big pant leg
for both your legs.

91
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,171
You mean a skirt?

92
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,006
No!

93
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,176
You're not getting it.
My thing is different, so shut up.

94
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,094
-[Chidi] Michael.
-Yep.

95
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,429
Is there any way that you can die?

96
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,933
Yeah, actually, there is.
It's called retirement.

97
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,687
It's rare, but when one of us
really screws something up...

98
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,064
And what happens exactly?

99
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,650
Well, it's fairly straightforward.

100
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,988
My essence would be scooped out
of my body with a flaming ladle

101
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,116
and every molecule on my body
would be placed

102
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,993
on the surface of a different sun.

103
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:45,910
Sure.

104
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:50,373
Is that what would happen if your boss
found out you defected to our side?

105
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,291
Yeah.

106
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,376
So that might actually happen.

107
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,171
And if it did,
there would be no more Michael.

108
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,507
Think about that for a second.

109
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,927
Imagine being retired.

110
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,556
Everyone else is here, but you?
Poof. Gone.

111
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,351
Nothingness. Inky-black void. Done.

112
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,396
Okay, I'll think about that.

113
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:24,949
Huh... So, you're saying I would be...

114
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,123
No... me?

115
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,837
[exclaiming]

116
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,512
Okay! Now we're getting somewhere.

117
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,349
Dude, you broke Michael!

118
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,936
No, no, this is good.
He's having an existential crisis.

119
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,688
It's a sort of anguish people go through

120
00:05:55,772 --> 00:06:00,401
when they contemplate the silent
indifference of our empty universe.

121
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,905
Look, the good news is,
if he can work through this,

122
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,657
it's the first step towards
understanding human ethics.

123
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,992
And what if he can't?

124
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,871
He'll be a lifeless shell
of misery forever and we're all doomed.

125
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,750
Okay, I will be right back.

126
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,210
Gonna go grab some Camus.

127
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,173
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

128
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:26,010
Can I get you a snack? Do you eat?
I can never remember. What do you eat?

129
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,763
Babies?
You want me to get you a big fat baby?

130
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,223
What flavor baby?

131
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,141
[gasps] How about a Cool Ranch Baby?

132
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,394
Searching for meaning
is philosophical suicide.

133
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,605
How does anyone do anything

134
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,692
when you understand
the fleeting nature of existence?

135
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,444
It's pretty easy, man.

136
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:48,866
You learn about death when you're a kid
and it's just not that big a deal.

137
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,411
[indistinct chatter on TV]

138
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:57,333
Eleanor, baby, I have some sad news.

139
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,627
Your doggie, Max, has passed away.

140
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,170
Do you know what that means?

141
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:07,593
Well, sometimes when a dog is very old,
five or six or something,

142
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,304
he crosses a long rainbow bridge.

143
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,516
And at the end of that bridge
is a beautiful farm,

144
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,021
with lots of grass and trees and,
I don’t know, wagons and a rainbow?

145
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,648
I already said rainbow.

146
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,359
The point is, that's where Max is.

147
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,236
Can we visit him at the farm?

148
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,990
Nope, because it's very far away

149
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,118
in Guam. It's in Guam.

150
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,327
-Can we at least--
-Okay, look!

151
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,829
I'm lying, okay?

152
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,622
You caught me. Congratulations.

153
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,208
The farm is made up,
the bridge is made up,

154
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,085
there's no such place as Guam.

155
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,880
Max is dead in a duffel bag
under the deck.

156
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:48,009
-How did he die?
-The short answer is, I don't know.

157
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,678
And the slightly longer answer is

158
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,932
I didn't know how hot it gets
in cars sometimes.

159
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,477
The point is, don't be sad.

160
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,521
Honestly, I'll get annoyed
if you do get sad,

161
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,609
because it's been a very long day
and that bitch Carol from work

162
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,112
was really on my ass
about some stupid thing

163
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,572
that I don't even know what it was.

164
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,282
And then at the end of that long day

165
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,867
I had to use
one of my favorite duffel bags

166
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,537
to do something very gross
that I did not like.

167
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:21,876
Now, let's celebrate that dead dog's life
by bringing Mommy another bottle of white.

168
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:27,381
[Tahani] I would say I outdid myself,
but I'm always this good.

169
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,800
So I simply did myself.

170
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,638
[sighs] Everything is perfect.

171
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:37,058
-Red alert. Red alert. We need help.
-What's wrong with Michael?

172
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,936
Uh-oh, I know that look.
He just snorted a bunch of printer toner.

173
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,522
Mike, listen to me.
You have nothing to worry about.

174
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,190
You still have
around 70% of your brain left.

175
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,193
No, no.
This is more like a philosophy overdose.

176
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,445
Basically, Michael smoked
a big bowl of ennui

177
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,614
and he's having an existential crisis.

178
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,783
So, we need to cheer him up.

179
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,870
Look at how pretty the restaurant is.

180
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,873
Didn't Tahani do a good job?

181
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,710
Parties are mere distractions
from the relentlessness of entropy.

182
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,756
We're all just corpses
who haven't yet begun to decay.

183
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,885
Yeah, but... balloons!

184
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,597
Okay, we all head over
to Vicky's party together.

185
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,226
We babysit Michael in shifts
so no one sees he's a catatonic blob.

186
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,978
Or you could just sit tight.

187
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,730
The entire party are going to be
heading over here soon,

188
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,358
unless I am sorely mistaken.

189
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,452
I was sorely mistaken.

190
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,957
Okay, bud, whatever's going on right now,
shove your feelings way down deep,

191
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,502
plaster on a fake smile
and pretend you're having fun, okay?

192
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,171
Just like I used to do when someone
started talking about their kids.

193
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,425
Hey, welcome, guys.

194
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,678
Wow! This is elaborate.

195
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,975
Gunnar was an animal rights activist,
so the theme of the party is animals.

196
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,103
Flying station's over there,
if you wanna fly like a falcon.

197
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,187
[whoops]

198
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,773
Over there,
we filled a ball pit with puppies.

199
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,983
That's fun.

200
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:09,900
[laughing]

201
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,153
Have you ever wanted to sit
in a kangaroo pouch?

202
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,946
My whole dang life.

203
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,448
We can all hang out here for a bit

204
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,491
and then we can head over to your party.
Sound good?

205
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,078
Yo, this place is lit.
I'm gonna go jump in that kangie's pouch.

206
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,455
Hey!

207
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,334
Tahani, you just need to
walk around the party looking miserable.

208
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,085
Great, just like that. Perfect.

209
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,379
Chidi and I will keep an eye on Michael.

210
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,673
-Where's Michael?
-[groans]

211
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,758
[engine revving]

212
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,386
Uh, I think I found him.

213
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,890
There they are. <i>Qué pasa, muchachos?</i>

214
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,892
Hey there, bud. You okay?

215
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,061
Okay? I'm a new man.

216
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,940
Eleanor, thank you so much for the advice
about shoving my feelings down deep.

217
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:54,862
I feel so much better. It's like
I'm surfing on this wave of positivity.

218
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,030
Is that Janet?

219
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,450
Yeah, have you met my secretary, Jeanette?

220
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,826
She's a lot like Janet,

221
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,788
but she doesn't pretend
she has all the answers.

222
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,166
-Hi, Jeanette.
-Oh, no. It's still me, Janet.

223
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,210
Michael asked that I change my appearance

224
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,171
and also say things like,
"You're so funny,"

225
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:16,175
and, "So, how many quarterbacks
are in a home run?"

226
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,636
[Michael] Man,
repressing your feelings is great.

227
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:23,099
I was feeling stress all the time
and now it's just so easy.

228
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,352
Babe, we need to get some food into you,
get you something to eat.

229
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,812
I don't eat anything.

230
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,856
She's perfect. Hey, turn that around.

231
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,320
It did kind of hurt, actually,
but I love it.

232
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:40,324
He's moved on from existential crisis
to straight up mid-life crisis.

233
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,409
That's good, right?

234
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,536
I knew a ton of guys like that
back in Arizona.

235
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,414
They hit on you when they're drunk
and their breath smells like supplements,

236
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,748
but overall, they're pretty harmless.

237
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,167
It's Chinese for Japan.

238
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,335
So cool.

239
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,337
No, no. This is worse.

240
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,590
An existential crisis
is an acknowledgment that life is absurd

241
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,300
and that absurdity needs to be confronted.

242
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,010
But this is just denial.

243
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,847
At any moment, that denial
could collapse and he'll be a mess.

244
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,682
He is a Jenga tower of sadness.

245
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,726
For an immortal being,
he's pretty fragile.

246
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,230
The guy contemplates
his own death for one forking minute

247
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,816
and completely loses his grip on reality?

248
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,533
You didn't have to come. I said I'm fine.

249
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:27,663
I know you guys weren't super close,
but still, it's hard losing a parent.

250
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,124
Eleanor! Mommy's here, baby.

251
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,335
Oh. And who is this tall drink of wine?

252
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,839
This is my boyfriend, Sam.
Sam, this is my mother.

253
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,383
Sister! Sister.
Ugh, that's not gonna work.

254
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,260
It's my ex-husband's funeral.

255
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,679
Thanks for blowing my cover, Doug!

256
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:48,058
Listen, baby. Don't be sad, okay?
Your father wasn't great.

257
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,144
Let's call him what he was.

258
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,313
A fart in the shape of a man.

259
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,439
Can you just chill?

260
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,232
I don't want to turn Dad's funeral
into a roast.

261
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,902
I'm not.
I'm just saying he sucked.

262
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,738
The only photo
they could get of him was a mugshot.

263
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:04,283
{\an8}He was a doof,
so don't be sad that he's gone.

264
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,826
I'm not sad. I'm fine.

265
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,871
Good. I had a long-running bet
with Eleanor's father

266
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,872
I would outlive him.

267
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,832
Guess who won that one? Guess.

268
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,125
We're at his funeral.
It's pretty clear.

269
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,669
I did! I won! He's dead. Up top.

270
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,507
Whoa! [chuckles]

271
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,591
Is there a bar? I'm gonna...

272
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,596
Did my mom slip you her hotel room key?

273
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,890
Yes. Yes, she did.

274
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,394
Thanks so much
for coming to Gunnar's birthday party.

275
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,563
Now, there was a bit of a mix-up

276
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,442
and Tahani also planned a birthday party
over at the restaurant.

277
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,819
So why don't we all head over there?

278
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,989
No need. This party is far superior.

279
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,115
I'm sure yours is amazing.

280
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,244
Well, I did fine on the decor,
but I don't have,

281
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,413
you know, actual unicorns you can ride.

282
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,998
[unicorn snorts]

283
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,668
[Tahani] So, you all just
stay here and have fun.

284
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,920
Okay, well, if that's what you want.

285
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,130
Let's get back to the party, then.

286
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,049
Hang on there,<i> mis amigos! </i>

287
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,801
-No, Michael. Oh, boy.
-[Michael] I want to make a toast.

288
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,136
Okay, I know what you're thinking.

289
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,932
Birth is a curse
and existence is a prison,

290
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,684
but don't think about that.

291
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,394
Don't be sad, you guys.

292
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:17,147
Focus on something great,
like Drakkar Noir.

293
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,275
Whoo! Which I'm wearing a lot of tonight.

294
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:24,363
Or the Sharper Image catalog.
What can't those guys ionize?

295
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,241
By the way, I am feeling amazing!

296
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,868
I'm gonna do some push-ups.

297
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,745
Then we'll go around the room
and name our favorite cheese.

298
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,582
That's good with the speeches.
That's good, yeah.

299
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,041
Let's get back to the party.

300
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,711
What was that?
You didn't run any of that by me.

301
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,880
Oh, I know, I know. I'm sorry, babe.

302
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,425
Listen, when you guys first took over,
I was upset.

303
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,843
But it's all good now.

304
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:50,180
I mean, anger is toxic.
I'm not about that negativity.

305
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,558
<i>Mi </i>torture<i> es su </i>torture.

306
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,227
I am so happy you're in charge.

307
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,354
Okay, well, good.

308
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,566
Namaste,<i> chica. </i>[laughs]

309
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,609
Do you wanna dance?

310
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,652
-No.
-Okay.

311
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,240
I'm leaving. I'm too miserable
to stay here for one more second.

312
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,368
Why? There are baby monkeys
and dolphins to ride

313
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,413
and a game of Hungry Hungry Hippos
with actual hippos.

314
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,834
This party is way better than ours.
Why are you miserable?

315
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,920
Oh...

316
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,630
You stay and have fun.

317
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,548
I'll throw myself a pity party,

318
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:28,135
though I doubt
I can even throw one of those properly.

319
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,178
[whimpers]

320
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,183
God, I love this stuff.

321
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,061
[grunts] Let's keep this party going!

322
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,271
What now, huh?
You wanna hit the clubs?

323
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,108
Oh! Vegas.
No, no, no, even better, Dubai.

324
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,151
[both gasp]

325
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,071
-Jeanette, make us a Dubai.
-[laughs]

326
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,658
I feel like
maybe we should wind down, huh, bud?

327
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,243
No, can't do that.
Can't stop moving.

328
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,411
If I stop moving, I'll start thinking.

329
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,330
If I start thinking,
I'll start thinking about things

330
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,791
I don't want to think about, like death.

331
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,709
Oops.

332
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,836
I'm thinking about it now.

333
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,630
Yep, I'm thinking about death again.

334
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,883
I know. Jeanette and I
have been taking samba lessons.

335
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,134
Let us show you how to do it.

336
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,721
I think Vicky bought his excuse,
but we need to snap him out of this.

337
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,016
Which one of these confusing French books
will make him normal again?

338
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,434
It's not that easy.

339
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,104
Emotionally, he's all over the map.

340
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,064
And I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I don't think

341
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,774
this can be solved with a book.

342
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:27,111
What's the big whoop?
I dealt with death and I was fine.

343
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,196
Were you? You never had one moment

344
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,366
where you were freaked out
by the permanence of death?

345
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,410
Never one moment like that?

346
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,206
-Hey, man, you got toothbrush holders?
-Sure, yeah. Right over here.

347
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:43,794
What's this? Who has four toothbrushes?
Bill Gates or something?

348
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,421
No, that's for a family.

349
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:52,511
Family? Like a whole family
and their toothbrushes all together?

350
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:57,766
Two slots for the parent toothbrushes
and two slots for their kids?

351
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,518
Yep.

352
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:04,023
So, the parent toothbrushes can be close
to the kid toothbrushes, and...

353
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,650
watch over them and...

354
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,781
they can all talk about
their toothbrush feelings.

355
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,994
And they can hold their little toothbrush
hands when they're sad

356
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,831
and make sure no harm ever comes
to their little bristles?

357
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,042
Sure.

358
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,543
[crying]

359
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:35,220
-You need a Kleenex?
-Thank you. Sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

360
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,889
A family pack?

361
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,850
{\an8}[sobbing]

362
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,105
[clears throat]

363
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,528
I don't know if what I'm gonna say
is going to hurt or help, but screw it.

364
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,322
Do you know
what's really happening right now?

365
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,408
You're learning
what it's like to be human.

366
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,369
All humans are aware of death,

367
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,165
so we're all a little bit sad,
all the time.

368
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,333
That's the deal.

369
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,753
Sounds like a crappy deal.

370
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,798
Well, yeah, it is.

371
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,383
But we don't get offered any other ones.

372
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:18,347
And if you try and ignore your sadness,
it just ends up leaking out of you anyway.

373
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,766
I've been there.
Everybody's been there.

374
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,101
So, don't fight it.

375
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:26,688
And in the words of a very wise
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond employee I once knew,

376
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,316
"Go ahead and cry all you want.

377
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,736
But you're gonna have to pay
for that toilet plunger."

378
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,909
Got you something to eat.

379
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,494
I'm not hungry.

380
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,875
I just want to sit and stare at nothing
and silently scream for the rest of time.

381
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,964
I might be way off base here,
but you seem kind of bummed.

382
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:57,010
I really thought I could throw a better
party than a magical, all-powerful being.

383
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:01,431
And moreover, what's this say about me,
about the life I lived?

384
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:05,269
The way they're torturing me
is through event-planning mishaps.

385
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,187
And it works. [sniffles]

386
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,231
Am I really that shallow?

387
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:15,821
Listen, back in Jacksonville,
I was in charge of a 60-person dance crew.

388
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:20,784
Whenever we auditioned a new dancer,
we would rate them in five categories.

389
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:26,874
Dancing ability, coolness, dopeness,
freshness and smart-brained.

390
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,544
I would give you an eight
in every category.

391
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,547
-Eight isn't bad, I suppose.
-No, no. Eight is the best.

392
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,467
It was a scale of one to 13,
but eight was highest.

393
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,179
The scale went up and back down,
like a tent.

394
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,764
Why? It's not important.

395
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,975
Lately, you've been really
down on yourself,

396
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,479
but you're the most amazing person
I've ever met, besides Michael.

397
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,858
And he was constantly torturing us,
so I'd only rank him a ten.

398
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,359
Which is worse than an eight?

399
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,404
That's so unnecessarily confusing.

400
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:03,285
The point is, you're cool, dope,
fresh and smart-brained.

401
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,206
Never seen you dance,
but I bet you're good,

402
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,166
because you're good at everything.

403
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,376
You're awesome.

404
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,670
Be nicer to yourself.

405
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,839
Thank you, Jason.

406
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,886
From one eight to another.

407
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,015
[Chidi] "Excellent progress this week.

408
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,018
Tahani, devastated by party mishap.

409
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:32,689
Eleanor continues to be a selfish monster,
creating burden for Chidi."

410
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,024
{\an8}Selfish monster?

411
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,735
{\an8}I brought you back from the brink
of an existential coma.

412
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,819
{\an8}-Selfish...
-No.

413
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,406
{\an8}I have to embellish your misery
on these fake torture reports

414
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,283
{\an8}so my boss doesn't get suspicious.

415
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,496
{\an8}But really, I am grateful
you pulled me out of my funk.

416
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,959
{\an8}Now that you've become acquainted
with existential crises,

417
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,296
{\an8}I thought we could read <i>Death,</i>
by philosopher Todd May.

418
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,298
{\an8}Sounds like the perfect beach read.

419
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,760
{\an8}Should we wait for Tahani and Jason?
Where are those goofballs?

420
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,266
So, we should probably discuss...

421
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,185
That was awesome!

422
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,981
It was. Surprisingly so.

423
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,816
But we should still discuss--

424
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,901
You want some breakfast?
I know how to make cereal.

425
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,654
-Sure, but Jason--
-Okay, be right back.
