1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:03,086
[Eleanor] So, what's on tap for today?

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,422
Chidi's study group
should be off and running.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,632
We can go check in on how Brent's doing.

4
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:11,553
If there's anyone that can turn that
ashhole into a good person, it's Chidi.

5
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:15,265
My man used to collect action figures
of famous philosophers.

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,810
"Ooh, Eleanor, look, it's a near-mint
Arthur Schopenhauer,

7
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,729
-with a working quill!"
-[laughing]

8
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:21,938
[chuckling] What a dork.

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,857
I love him so much.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,609
Chidi might make the new humans better
all on his own.

11
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,070
It's so great he erased his memory.

12
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,199
But, you know,
it's also quite sad, for you,

13
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:37,120
in a way that I always think about,
and am respectful of.

14
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,121
[man laughing]

15
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,873
What the fork?

16
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,208
Hi, Eleanor. Hi, Michael.

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,210
We were just heading off for a picnic.

18
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:48,923
Oh! You know, we were actually just gonna
go check in on your new student, Brent.

19
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,884
Oh, I'm not sure Brent's in it
for the long haul.

20
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,552
He came to one session,

21
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,722
and then he said he got a B-plus
in Moral Values at Princeton,

22
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,390
and so maybe he should be the professor.

23
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,601
Then he asked me if I knew
that he went to Princeton.

24
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,852
I said I did.

25
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,897
Then he said he went to Princeton,
and he left.

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,106
Eh, what are you gonna do?

27
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,067
[chuckles] Well, just for argument's sake,

28
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,071
what would Kant say about your duty
to help your fellow human beings?

29
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,823
Well, honestly,
when the weather is this perfect,

30
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,702
I think that Kant would say,
"Who's up for some frisbee golf?"

31
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,787
[Chidi laughing]

32
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,038
[Michael chuckling]

33
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,543
[Chidi] Guys, you gotta hear this joke
I made about Kant.

34
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,297
Never seen Chidi like that.
He was chillaxing,

35
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,926
which is a word I just invented
combining "Chidi" and "relaxing."

36
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,222
I guess once you have the burden of
saving humanity removed from your brain,

37
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,348
life is dandy.

38
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,016
Must be nice, Chidi.

39
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,186
That's what's missing.
Chidi isn't being tortured.

40
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,563
As far as he's concerned,
he did everything right on Earth,

41
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,941
so now he just gets to enjoy himself.

42
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,111
If we don't force Chidi
into stressful decision-making,

43
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,738
he won't even have the chance
to become a better person.

44
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,656
Right.

45
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,867
If you wanna make a pearl,
you gotta get some sand in your clam.

46
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,785
Oyster.

47
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,371
We need Chidi to live in a world
of low-grade dread.

48
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,330
I've got this.

49
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,667
I have a ton of experience
making ex-boyfriends' lives miserable.

50
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,795
First up, we fill his acoustic guitar
with wet cat food.

51
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,381
Judge me all you want, I get results.

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,931
-Janet, darling?
-Hi, there.

53
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,100
-Ooh! You dyed your hair?
-I did.

54
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,687
{\an8}After I broke up with Jason, I researched
how humans cope with relationships ending,

55
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,648
and number eight on the list was
doing something dumb with your hair.

56
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,860
Number 42 was watch <i>Mamma Mia!</i>
<i>Here We Go Again, </i>so I did that, too.

57
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,069
{\an8}It was okay.

58
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,946
{\an8}It's just a lot of the same songs
as the first one.

59
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,116
{\an8}Well, hopefully "diving back into work"
was also high on that list,

60
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,202
{\an8}because we need to help John
and I know how.

61
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,328
Spa day.

62
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,288
"Spa day"?

63
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,790
{\an8}That's right, Janet.
I've cracked the code.

64
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,419
See, in 2014, John wrote 11 articles

65
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,755
{\an8}mocking Gigi Hadid's vacation
at an exclusive resort in Bali.

66
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,925
{\an8}But then he researched cheap flights
to Bali for himself,

67
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,179
{\an8}and looked into something called
a "discount hotel package"?

68
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:04,559
{\an8}See, John's pettiness was the result of
feeling excluded by the rich and powerful.

69
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,436
{\an8}So, I, the rich and powerful,

70
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,815
{\an8}shall welcome him into an exclusive world
of luxury and pampering.

71
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,233
{\an8}Oh, he loves celebrity gossip.

72
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,485
{\an8}You should tell him how eight
different characters from <i>Game of Thrones</i>

73
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,445
{\an8}are based on you.

74
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,365
{\an8}That is a great idea.
See? You're getting it now.

75
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,119
First, we open his pores
and then we open his heart.

76
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:29,167
{\an8}We exfoliate the dead skin cells of envy,
and we detoxify his soul.

77
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,586
{\an8}-Spa day.
-Spa day.

78
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,546
-I'm so excited for spa day!
-[tittering]

79
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,424
I mean, I know I can eat
whatever I want and not gain weight,

80
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,926
and the air is obviously perfect,

81
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,470
and no one has any jobs,
or stress or problems,

82
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,931
but I just feel like I need this.

83
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,935
{\an8}Well, you are in for a treat,
'cause I had Janet build an exact replica

84
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,063
{\an8}of Victoria Beckham's
ultra-exclusive private spa.

85
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,064
Posh's spa?

86
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,440
The Posh Wash?

87
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,817
It's the most coveted invitation
in England.

88
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,403
Membership is based
on weight and net worth.

89
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,073
Gain a pound or lose a pound
and you're out.

90
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,115
-[gasps]
-Shall we go?

91
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,203
Jason, there you are. We need your help.

92
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,372
Okay, hand me the jar.

93
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,376
-What?
-The peanut butter jar. Give it.

94
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,004
You said you needed help
opening a peanut butter jar.

95
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,214
No, we didn't.

96
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,131
Oh.

97
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,718
-Then who said that?
-No one. Shut up and listen.

98
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,263
We need your help
with something very important.

99
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,180
Are you sure?

100
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,599
I'll probably just mess it up
like I messed things up with Janet.

101
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,977
Dude, helping to save humanity

102
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,312
is as good a way as any
to get over a breakup.

103
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,481
It's not like Janet has a car you can key,

104
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,400
or a house you can "Left Eye Lopes."

105
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,445
Okay, I'm in. I got your back, guys.

106
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,446
Now, hand me that jar.

107
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,825
Are you speaking metaphorically?

108
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:47,412
Like, the task we're embarking on
is a metaphorical jar

109
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,290
you're gonna open
by accomplishing the task?

110
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,459
Yes.

111
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,714
[gasps] Oh, goodie, cucumber water.

112
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,884
Nope, this is fresh water
from Oprah's estate in Maui,

113
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,846
with mushrooms from her private bog
in the Pyrenees mountains.

114
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,140
Oh, my God, it tastes like candy.

115
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,141
You know what they say,

116
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,936
"A mushroom from Oprah's bog is
better than anything from anywhere else."

117
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,439
[sighs] I didn't know that they said that.

118
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,108
I missed out on all
the cool celebrity sayings.

119
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,609
Say goodbye to FOMO.

120
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,113
You can finally experience
the best of the best.

121
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:26,284
The only thing that would make this any
better is some hot goss. [chuckles]

122
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,201
Very well.

123
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,997
Our story begins when I ran into
Robbie Williams, Heidi Klum,

124
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,126
and the remaining members of Fifth Harmony
at the Dolce &amp; Gabbana spring show.

125
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,130
Hate him, loathe her, over them,
cancel it, tell me everything.

126
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,050
So Natalie Portman does
all of Scarlett Johansson's stunts?

127
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,386
-Why?
-For the power. Just to say she can.

128
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,513
[scoffs] Sure. I get that.

129
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,476
Oh, Tahani, I feel amazing. Thank you.

130
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,852
You're quite welcome.

131
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,855
Hey, you know what would give you
an even more luminous glow?

132
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,609
There was a sort of inner treatment
that was all the rage on Earth,

133
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,402
the study of ethics.

134
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,988
Think of it as a colonic,
but for your soul.

135
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,782
Our resident philosopher, Chidi Anagonye,

136
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,658
leads an ethics study group
in his apartment.

137
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,911
What do you say you and I sit in?

138
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:15,875
Would I like to use my time in heaven
to audit a philosophy class?

139
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,919
Um...

140
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:18,836
No.

141
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,005
You stay crazy, girl. Bye.

142
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,802
-[Chidi] Hey.
-[Eleanor] Hi.

143
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,012
-So, how was the picnic?
-Oh, amazing.

144
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,848
I mean, there were ants everywhere,
but they were so helpful.

145
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,809
They carried our wine glasses
back and forth

146
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,561
and they folded our napkins for us.
It was so cute.

147
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,022
Wait till you see the otters
who do our turndown service.

148
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,066
Listen, you might know Jianyu, the monk?

149
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,360
He wants to join
your philosophy study group.

150
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,403
Oh, sure, we can get that
up and running again.

151
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,864
Maybe discuss some Lao Tzu and Confucius.

152
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,491
Fun! Everything is so fun.

153
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,408
Perfect.

154
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,871
Um, just one thing. So, he's been having
kind of a hard time adjusting here.

155
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,707
Apparently, monks aren't
the most social creatures.

156
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,001
So, just promise me
you'll help him no matter what?

157
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:04,298
Eleanor, I swear to you, I will look after
Jianyu as if he is my own brother.

158
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,216
Wow.

159
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:09,053
I mean, a promise from
a strict Kantian like yourself

160
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,515
is just about the most ironclad agreement
in the universe.

161
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,018
-[chuckling] Okay, buh-bye.
-Bye.

162
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,856
So, Jianyu, would you like some--

163
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,691
Yo, shut up for a sec.
I'm not a Buddhist monk.

164
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,443
My name is Jason Mendoza,

165
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,736
I'm a DJ from Florida,
and I'm not supposed to be here.

166
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,448
You gotta help me out, homie.
I'm scared.

167
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,576
[sighs] Tea.
I was gonna offer you some tea.

168
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,207
{\an8}Dude, thanks to you, my dream came true.
I have a shiny new budhole.

169
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,334
-You okay, homie?
-No.

170
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,630
I've had a stomachache for a week.
There have been way too many close calls.

171
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:49,844
Please, I beg you, no more meatball subs,
no more drawing boobs in the dirt.

172
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,721
I cannot lie to cover for you.

173
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,515
Please, remember,
you're supposed to be a monk.

174
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,475
[knocking at door]

175
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,894
Hey. [chuckling]

176
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,813
Eleanor and Michael are here.
What a fun surprise.

177
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,565
-You've done some re-decorating.
-Oh!

178
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,235
Uh, yes, my apartment was decorated
in one way

179
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,446
and now it has been... redecorated.

180
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,782
-And how is Jianyu?
-I mean, you know how monks are.

181
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,117
Calm. Peaceful.

182
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,661
Never, you know...
shotgunning Cheez Whiz. [chuckles]

183
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,497
What monk would do that? No monk!

184
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,207
[chuckles] Anyway...

185
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,250
I see you guys are still here.

186
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,419
We were just dropping by to ask a favor.

187
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,506
Can you accompany Jianyu
to the luau tonight?

188
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,217
He still isn't really engaging
with the neighborhood.

189
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,552
We're hoping you could help him
break out of his shell.

190
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,472
-Actually, I don't think I can make it.
-Oh, why not?

191
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,520
I just remembered... I can make it,
so I will see you there.

192
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,021
Okay. Bye.

193
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,526
-[Hawaiian music playing]
-[indistinct laughter]

194
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,196
I don't understand why John
hasn't made more progress.

195
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,114
You've done so much
to make him feel special.

196
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,032
I know.

197
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,035
I recreated the private tour of the Louvre
where they let you touch all the art.

198
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,037
We rode Aquamans through the water.

199
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,833
I got so many beauty treatments, I fear
my hair may be too shiny and lustrous.

200
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,335
We've been getting on quite well,

201
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:08,506
but every time I bring up
self-improvement, he just shuts me down.

202
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,299
I haven't encountered this much resistance

203
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,927
since I tried to get Timothée Chalamet
to go out into the sun.

204
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,515
You know, I looked at John's files again.
He was hardly a shrinking violet.

205
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,309
If you think he needs help,
maybe you should just tell him directly.

206
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,477
Perhaps you're right.

207
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,396
I shall go on the attack,

208
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:27,483
just like six of the eight <i>Game of Thrones</i>
characters who were based on me would do.

209
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,693
Yeah.

210
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,988
-So, how are things going with Chidi?
-Super easy.

211
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,657
All I have to do is be myself
and he's constantly freaking out.

212
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,742
You have that effect on people, bud.

213
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,327
What else can we do to mess up his life?

214
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,705
Mmm, listen, E-Dog,

215
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:45,918
I know people don't look to me for plans,
or ideas, or anything,

216
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,545
but maybe we should ease off.

217
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,005
He's pretty stressed already.

218
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,340
Please. He's not even dry-heaving yet.

219
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,800
How many Tums did he take today?

220
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,427
-Like, 20.
-[scoffs] That's nothing.

221
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,012
We don't stop until it's the whole bottle.

222
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,140
Because the more miserable he is,
the more he's going to teach you,

223
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,684
and then everyone,
and then he'll save humanity.

224
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,687
He's like Superman with nervous diarrhea.

225
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,023
Get ready.
I'm gonna make that speech soon.

226
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,861
Hey, girl.
Wanna hit up the spa tomorrow?

227
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,487
I wanna try that new
<i>Little Mermaid</i> treatment,

228
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,989
the one where they remove
your vocal chords

229
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,866
and it somehow makes
your legs look amazing.

230
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,328
Perhaps, but I was hoping
to bend your ear on a more serious matter.

231
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,205
The things you used to write, frankly...

232
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,626
-were hurtful.
-What? Name one.

233
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,837
I gained five pounds and you
called me "Ta-Hammy All-The-Meals."

234
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,547
[scoffs] I mean, that's just poetry.

235
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,883
You were so mean to Daniel Day-Lewis
he quit acting.

236
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,384
Oh, I'm sorry,
was he "living in character"

237
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,178
as a man who thought
he could pull off boot-cut jeans?

238
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,097
You know what? I see what this is.
This has been a fake friendship.

239
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,017
This whole week has just been
a wind-up to a sucker punch.

240
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,019
No, it hasn't.

241
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:48,272
I just want you to recognize
that your blog hurt people

242
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,150
and you have a chance to be better here.

243
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,820
B'scuse me?
You're telling me to be better?

244
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,281
While you were gallivanting around
with your fancy friends,

245
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,076
I lived in the real world,
so I had bills to pay.

246
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,081
I worked 16 hours a day, by myself,
building a site with millions of readers.

247
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,626
You're the one with issues, sweetheart.
If ya spot it, ya got it.

248
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,878
Whoosh!

249
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,172
That's another deuce
for the Gossip Toilet.

250
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,007
[scoffs]

251
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,844
Hello and welcome.
Is everyone having fun tonight?

252
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,929
[crowd cheering]

253
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:25,017
We have an exciting activity
planned for all of you.

254
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,270
You have all been given
a magic lava stone.

255
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,065
When you throw them into the bonfire,

256
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:36,153
you will receive
whatever your soul most desires.

257
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,698
-[crowd exclaims]
-Step right up, Matilda. Give it a toss.

258
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,616
[breathes deeply]

259
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,789
-[crowd exclaims]
-[Michael chuckling]

260
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,167
[gasps] My childhood pet,
Shell Turtlestein.

261
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,670
-[giggles] Hi.
-I wanna do that.

262
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,965
No! You cannot,
under any circumstances, do that.

263
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,967
Okay, but I gotta do that.

264
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,927
No. If you throw that stone,

265
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,639
your truest, actual desire will appear,
and who knows what that is?

266
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,557
I do.

267
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,601
My old motorcycle with Pamela Anderson
airbrushed on the side.

268
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,228
It exploded a week after I got it,

269
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,564
because someone wanted to see
what would happen

270
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,691
if they poured lighter fluid
in the engine.

271
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,859
Was that someone you?

272
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,278
Yep. Turns out it explodes. Called it.

273
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,865
Look, maybe Jianyu the monk
likes motorcycles.

274
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,575
We don't know his life.

275
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:27,496
No monk's truest desire is a motorcycle
with Pam Anderson's face painted on it.

276
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,373
Oh, it wasn't her face.

277
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,043
No, no, no.

278
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,134
A sexually explicit motorcycle?
Whose rock was that?

279
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,094
[stammering] Yay!

280
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,304
It's mine.

281
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,142
Jianyu tossed my rock, uh,
because he wanted to help me,

282
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:54,398
his friend, who loves motorcycles
and Canadian TV actress, Pamela Anderson.

283
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,357
Thanks, Jianyu.

284
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,110
And now, I will... ride it away.

285
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,574
Can't wait to cruise the streets
in this bad boy. [chuckles softly]

286
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,909
Yeah, man.

287
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,619
Now we're cooking with gas.

288
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,079
Well, this was a huge success.

289
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,706
Chidi's an absolute mess.

290
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,541
Oh, we should pop open some champagne.

291
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,918
Call those magic ants.

292
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,836
He's clearly being tested
like never before.

293
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,963
Yeah, and now we need
to ramp up the pressure.

294
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,299
Eleanor, he told an outright lie.

295
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,093
We don't want him so freaked out
that he can't help anyone else.

296
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,553
I think we did enough for the day.

297
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,806
No way, dude. We can't stop now.
We have to push him to the edge.

298
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,017
We have to knead his fragile psyche

299
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,061
until he's hyperventilating
and losing his mind.

300
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:32,978
[knocking at door]

301
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,731
Hi. Guys... Um...

302
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,650
-Hey, can we talk?
-Yeah.

303
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,401
I need to tell you a secret. I...

304
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,612
[hyperventilating]

305
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,530
I can't.

306
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,864
[continues hyperventilating]

307
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,912
No, no, no. Guys, guys, not now.

308
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,790
[ant whistles]

309
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,960
I spent my whole life on Earth
battling a stomachache

310
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,878
because I never knew what to do.

311
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:02,174
And for a while here, that was gone,
but recently, I've been miserable.

312
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,301
Why, Chidi?
You're in the Good Place.

313
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,470
I know, but I have this problem.

314
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,348
And if I choose Option A...

315
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,724
[gulps]

316
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,935
But if I choose Option B...

317
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,979
[exhales] No.

318
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:20,234
You know, Chidi, sometimes,
adversity can lead to growth.

319
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,194
Whatever the moral dilemma is,

320
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,281
maybe you'll come out
on the other side better for it.

321
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,740
Yeah.

322
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,951
No.

323
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,705
I'm used to moral dilemmas.
I like moral dilemmas. They're my jam.

324
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,291
-But this just feels like I'm...
-What?

325
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,543
Like I'm being punished somehow.

326
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,087
And, obviously, I know that's silly.
This is the Good Place.

327
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,839
You two would never do
anything to hurt anyone.

328
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,843
But I am seriously worried
that I did something wrong,

329
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,929
and this is the universe
getting back at me.

330
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:50,973
[whimpers]

331
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,349
Oh, no.

332
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,977
-[whimpering]
-[Chidi] What's happening now?

333
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,396
Oh, no. No, no, no.

334
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,398
I made God cry?

335
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,649
[crying]

336
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,776
Oh, stomachache. Welcome back, old friend.

337
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,821
[Tahani] Oh, I can't believe John.

338
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,783
The man who once started a protracted
Twitter feud with Jacob Tremblay

339
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,994
thinks that I'm the one with issues?

340
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,163
Ugh. Maybe you need to be
even more direct with him.

341
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,497
Like, punch him in the face.

342
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,708
I don't know. I'm fired up.

343
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,961
You've just been very nice to him and I
don't like the way he's treating you.

344
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,755
Maybe it's not possible.
We're just too different.

345
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,757
He spent his life
in the bowels of the Internet,

346
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,926
jealous and miserable,
with no real friends,

347
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,762
while I spent my life
in the upper echelon of society...

348
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,807
jealous and miserable with...

349
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,185
no real friends.

350
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,521
[gasps] Oh, Janet. I've been going
about this all wrong.

351
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,106
Exactly. Here you go.

352
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,399
Oh, uh...

353
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,317
No.

354
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,862
Why? Why are you crying?

355
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,908
This is all my fault.
I promised I'd take care of you, Chidi.

356
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,827
-You did?
-Yes. I promised.

357
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:58,165
Uh, see, Chidi, the architect is
responsible for the entire neighborhood,

358
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:02,753
so a resident suffering in any way,
it's very painful for her.

359
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,421
Actually, come here, come here.

360
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,298
But don't worry.

361
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,802
We have a very simple solution
for problems here.

362
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,971
-Oh, good. What is it?
-We eliminate them.

363
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,515
So, you just tell us the problem,
and we'll eliminate it.

364
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,683
Like, uh...

365
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,810
say you had a problem with that vase.

366
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,020
-[Chidi exclaims]
-[Michael chuckles]

367
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:20,980
See?

368
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,358
So, just tell me what's bothering you,
I'll wave my hand, it'll explode,

369
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,111
and you can go back
to your otherwise perfect life.

370
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,028
Uh...

371
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,491
The motorcycle. Yup, that's my problem.

372
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,493
For some reason,
it just hasn't been bringing me

373
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,829
as much happiness
as maybe it was intended to,

374
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,957
-so I'd just as soon get rid of it.
-Done.

375
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,710
Oh, not again.

376
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,088
-No more motorcycle. Problem solved.
-Great.

377
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,049
-[chuckles]
-Uh, Eleanor, I hope you feel better.

378
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,968
No, no, she'll be fine. She'll be fine.

379
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,013
John? I have something to say.

380
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,681
Round two? Let's do this.

381
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,435
In 2007, Blake Lively invited me
to a birthday party

382
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,438
held for Leonardo DiCaprio
aboard Paul Allen's mega-yacht.

383
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,523
Hmm, I see we're dropping names
three at a time now.

384
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,944
The guest list was 100 of the wealthiest,
most famous members of the glitterati.

385
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,655
Once aboard,
I discovered there was a VIP deck.

386
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,742
And within that area, there was
an even more exclusive room

387
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,203
that you could only access with
a secret PIN, which I promptly entered.

388
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,872
And guess who was waiting for me?

389
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,083
I hate to admit it,
but I have to know. Who?

390
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,084
No one.

391
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,836
I was the only one there.

392
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,005
The party raged on outside,

393
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,842
but I was so obsessed with status
that I never left.

394
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,470
I spent the entire night
talking to no one.

395
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,514
Riveting story.
If only it were longer and sadder.

396
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:42,561
The point is, if all you care about
in the world is the velvet rope,

397
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,939
you will always be unhappy,
no matter which side you're on.

398
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,567
You and I are proof of that.

399
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,235
But now we're here.

400
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,030
Can we just start over?

401
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,782
Well...

402
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,827
if we're gonna be friends,
I need to say something.

403
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,665
I really am sorry for all the posts
I wrote about you.

404
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,584
And everything I tweeted.

405
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,587
And scrawled on the back of a <i>Playbill</i>
during the intermission of <i>Wicked,</i>

406
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,756
and had someone pass it to you
and say it was from

407
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,216
an anonymous, concerned citizen.

408
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,759
-That was you?
-[clicks tongue]

409
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:17,137
Well, my bangs were
"making my ears look chunky."

410
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,097
That was a fair hit.

411
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:19,723
[John chuckles]

412
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,392
It's a lovely night.

413
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,478
Would you like to go for a walk?

414
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,196
-[imitating electric guitar]
-Hey, Jason? New plan.

415
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,741
Instead of just trying to not get caught,
we're going to study ethics.

416
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,661
I'm going to help you
become a good person.

417
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,412
Oh, dope. I always wanna get better.

418
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,915
That's why I spent so much
of my time at the free clinic.

419
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,419
Hang on, just editing my syllabus
in my head based on that comment.

420
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,796
This is gonna be awesome. You rule.

421
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,632
You're like the Pam Anderson
boob-motorcycle of people.

422
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,801
Thank you. That's an amazing compliment.

423
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,929
And I'm sorry
your actual motorcycle blew up.

424
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,222
That's okay, homie.

425
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,224
That's just what motorcycles do.

426
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,019
So, Chidi's set with Jason now.

427
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,148
-How are you doing?
-A little better...

428
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,941
but still terrible.

429
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,236
You were torturing him
because that's what we had to do.

430
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,154
I know.

431
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,030
I went too far.

432
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,867
And what's worse, I liked it.

433
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,455
Because I'm angry at him for leaving me,

434
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,919
which isn't even remotely fair,
because he sacrificed himself for us,

435
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,381
but I'm still angry he abandoned me,
which makes me feel guilty,

436
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,259
which makes me angry,
which makes me want to talk to Chidi,

437
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,720
because he's the person
I go to when I'm angry.

438
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,972
So, it's a real fun cycle.

439
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,644
I still don't have a grip
on the human emotional spectrum.

440
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,731
You guys are often happy
when you should be sad,

441
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,441
and angry when you should be happy,

442
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,693
and texting when you should be driving,

443
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,447
which is not an emotion, I know,
but it's insane.

444
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,699
The point is, in this case,

445
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:05,370
even if it's not rational,
you're allowed to feel a little angry.

446
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,955
Let yourself off the hook.

447
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,750
Process it and work your way through it.

448
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,587
And then get your shirt together,
because we have a lot of work to do.

449
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,088
[knocking at door]

450
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,256
Morning, all.

451
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,051
Anyone interested in a status report?

452
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,720
I win! I mean, I'll start.

453
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,681
I have made massive progress with John.

454
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,892
Great. Is he gonna join Chidi's class?

455
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,061
Philosophy may not be his way forward.

456
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:33,023
Genuine human connection
shall be his course of study.

457
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,858
{\an8}And first up on the syllabus,

458
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,819
{\an8}he and I will be unironically watching

459
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,697
{\an8}the Britney Spears movie
<i>Crossroads</i> together... [chuckles]

460
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,075
{\an8}and you'll have to trust me,

461
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,827
{\an8}this is a huge step
in the right direction.

462
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,371
{\an8}Wonderful work, Tahani.

463
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,040
{\an8}And, Jason, I mean, bravo.

464
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,167
{\an8}Thanks, guys.

465
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,086
{\an8}It's been a tough couple weeks,

466
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:59,633
{\an8}and it just felt really good to be brainy,
and have... use-ness.

467
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,926
{\an8}Sure, bud.

468
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,053
{\an8}Well, I think we can finally say

469
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,014
that all four of these mofos
are on the right path.

470
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,558
So... what's next?
