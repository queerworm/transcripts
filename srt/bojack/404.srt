I'm bad news.

You're actually not the first

-And I'm not looking for another dad.

who my mother is.

That's all the relationship
we need to have.

16

The point is I banged a lot of women.

nooners, spooners, hot-air ballooners.

is there any chance
one of them got pregnant

20

But when I called the number
that you gave me,

Isn't this just gonna make them feel bad?

163
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,080
Not everyone gets to have
great sex all the time, right?

164
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,790
Ladies?

165
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,336
Diane? Can I talk to you
in your office for a minute?

166
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,504
I don't have an office.

167
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,131
You said offices have corners
and corners are the patriarchy.

168
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,927
Fine. Can I talk to you in the hot-take,
cool-down yoga area?

169
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,764
[deep breathing]

170
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,848
You seem tense.

171
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,018
Have you been eating gluten
and also not having sex with your husband?

172
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,394
Whoa, Stefani, that's not--

173
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:45,942
Diane, relax! This is not a conversation
between an employee and her superior.

174
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:50,279
This is a conversation
between a friend and her superior.

175
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,324
The campaign
has been testing our marriage.

176
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,993
Obviously, it's great to see
Mr. Peanutbutter so excited,

177
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,745
and I am supporting that.

178
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,913
But if I'm being honest,

179
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,791
I can't wait for it to be over
so things can go back to normal.

180
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,877
-Hmm. And what happens if he wins?
-He's not going to win.

181
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,338
Did you see the new CNN poll this morning?

182
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,091
He could win. People do love fracking.

183
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:14,095
It's fun to say! "Frack! Frack!
Fricky-fricky-frack" [laughs]

184
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,598
People wouldn't love saying it
if they understood what it actually was.

185
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,101
-So tell them.
-I can't go against my husband.

186
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,104
What the frack? Why not?
You gotta do you, girl.

187
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,773
I always say, you gotta do you.

188
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,943
And if he's doing him,
then who's doing you?

189
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,280
Because right now,
it seems like no one's doing you.

190
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,531
[groans]

191
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,118
...and then when I was eight,

192
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,371
Lizzie Dunbar's mom rented us all
<i>Freaky Friday</i> for a sleepover,

193
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:44,750
and I got really sad because I realized
I didn't have a mom to switch bodies with.

194
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,919
Am I talking a lot?
I feel I'm talking a lot.

195
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,005
-Yes.
-Oh! I need to show you something.

196
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,465
Okay, so this may seem cuckoo,

197
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,260
but I was so head over heels
in love with your father

198
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,555
that after we made sweet love,
and he didn't call me again,

199
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:01,350
I just got so jealous, so I made a list
of every girl he was with...

200
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,394
and I found their home addresses...

201
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,688
-Oh.
-...and drew Xs over their eyes.

202
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,984
I'm loving this conversation
but I have to go the bathroom now,

203
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:14,905
for non-me being weirded out
by this conversation-related reasons.

204
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,908
I just keep thinking about
how different things would have been

205
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,285
if you'd have just called me.

206
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:23,247
We could have had a family together
for 18 loving years.

207
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,957
-That might have--
-[Hollyhock] BoJack!

208
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,500
[groans] Kids. What?

209
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,586
Can you join me
in the bathroom for a minute?

210
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,670
What?! No!

211
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,466
-Do you want me, sweetheart?
-No, it's a dad bathroom thing.

212
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,719
Uh... Hollyhock?

213
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,764
That woman is not my mother.
She's lying to us!

214
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,973
Marcy? No way!

215
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,768
Look. This is from the premiere
of <i>Autumn in New York.</i>

216
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,897
That movie came out in August of 2000.
I was born in September.

217
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,232
Does this woman look
eight months pregnant to you?

218
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,778
Why would they release a romantic drama
called <i>Autumn in New York</i>

219
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,945
in the middle of summer?

220
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,073
Richard Gere
had just done <i>Runaway Bride,</i>

221
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,367
Winona Ryder was hot off
<i>Girl, Interrupted</i>

222
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,827
-so the studio got cocky.
-How do you know all this?

223
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,497
I looked it up on the Internet
because I saw this picture

224
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,416
and got confused why Marcy
would wear a summer dress

225
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,543
to a movie called
<i>Autumn in New York.</i>

226
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,171
This is a summer dress?
I guess I don't know dresses.

227
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,757
BoJack, focus! That's not my mom!

228
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,676
So the lesson here is
I was right to never call her.

229
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,637
-Wait, so who--
-[Marcy] Are you okay in there?

230
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,847
-Don't come in!
-Yes! Father-daughter bathroom time!

231
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,476
The scrapbook! She has that list
of all the other women you slept with.

232
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,853
If we get the book, we can find my mom.

233
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,399
Give me a few minutes. I'll distract her,
then you sneak in and grab the book.

234
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,444
[BoJack] Okay.

235
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,531
And what was the first appearance
of the Horse's identical cousin?

236
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,866
[Marcy] Season eight, episode four.

237
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,121
[BoJack] Yeah, yeah. That's right.
What was the horse's boss's name?

238
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,248
-What are you doing?
-Oh, my God!

239
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,125
You're not supposed to see this.
Look away!

240
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,877
It's okay, Hollyhock.
This is what Mommy and Daddy do.

241
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,506
-Ugh! You said give you a few minutes!
-I didn't think it would take this long.

242
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,757
I usually finish faster.

243
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,844
-You're disgusting!
-[moans] That's what I needed.

244
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,768
-Can I please have a grasshopper?
-[seductively] Yes?

245
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,604
So the studio finished<i> Mars Attacks!</i>
without him.

246
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,606
And since no one ever found a body,

247
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,109
my client Tony Tromboni
has been making movies

248
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,987
-under the name Tim Burton ever since.
-Oh!

249
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,613
-[chiming]
-<i>I'm Harvey Fierstein.</i>

250
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:24,076
<i>Your ovulation window is closing soon.</i>
<i>Please commence copulation.</i>

251
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,578
Oh, fish! We gotta go.

252
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,663
-Can't we finish lunch?
-You heard the bracelet.

253
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,206
Okay, well, uh, let me get the check.

254
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,001
-There's no time for that! Ralph!
-We gotta pay for our--

255
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,129
I have an egg inside me
that is ripe to be fertilized.

256
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,922
His name is Philbert.

257
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,425
-Princess Carolyn--
-Uh-uh! Philbert Stilton,

258
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:43,721
and he's going to be sweet and smart
and a phenom on the clarinet,

259
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,891
and one day you'll be driving him home
from band practice

260
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,853
and he's going to all of a sudden
say something so insightful and true

261
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,649
that you'll be positively floored
it came out of the mouth of your son.

262
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,694
But if you don't take me home right now
and impregnate me,

263
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,113
-then Philbert will never exist.
-[plates clatter]

264
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,948
Okay, let's go.

265
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,287
-You told me to distract her.
-We don't need to talk about it.

266
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,290
So now that we got the list,
we gotta go see all these other women?

267
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,792
Not all of them,
just the ones you didn't see

268
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,420
in the nine months
after you had sex with them.

269
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,506
-That's gonna be most of them.
-Yeah, figures.

270
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,715
Ooh!

271
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:24,762
Tilda Madison? You dated the Timedium,
Tuesdays at 9:00 on CBS?

272
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,139
I never understood that show.
What's a Timedium?

273
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,265
She's a medium,

274
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,935
but she can also travel through time
and she solves crimes.

275
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,188
That's so stupid.
She time-travels and she's a medium?

276
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,608
But the one crime she can't solve
is her husband's murder.

277
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,068
[groans]

278
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,945
[sitar playing]

279
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:45,533
So my name is Hollyhock and I love apples
but hate applesauce, too slimy.

280
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,451
I was the captain of the JV soccer team--

281
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,664
BoJack, why did you bring this child
into my sanctum?

282
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,873
I can make this real quick.

283
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,000
Did you give up my secret baby
in the year 2000?

284
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,962
Oh, BoJack, do you recall
the impetus for our uncoupling?

285
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,089
Is every one of these
gonna be a whole thing?

286
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,007
You were a cad and a boor.

287
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:08,681
But your fits of sardonic japery amused,
to a point, until you impregnated me.

288
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,059
Suddenly, I was awash in dreams
of idealized domesticity.

289
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,770
But when I told you I was with child,

290
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,940
I received a check in the mail
for $200 with the memo line,

291
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,359
"BoJack's half of the abortion."

292
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,902
So you put me up for adoption?

293
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,863
Child, no. I had the abortion.

294
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,615
Nice. You don't want
any little BoJacks floating around.

295
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,701
Last thing this world needs
is more of this garbage.

296
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,996
-Uh, excuse me?
-No, you're great, you seem cool,

297
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,582
but if we could go back in time
and prevent it...

298
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,666
-Right?
-[groans]

299
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,042
Hollyhock, I didn't mean...

300
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,798
By the way, your show sucks.
Should be called <i>Tedium.</i>

301
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,216
-[tires screeching]
-[horn honks]

302
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,342
[chiming]

303
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:49,805
<i>Your uterus contains the secrets of life,</i>
<i>the ability to create.</i>

304
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,765
-Go, go! Oh, God!
-I'm going!

305
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,519
<i>At this point, your ovum has burst out</i>
<i>of the swollen follicle,</i>

306
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,731
<i>traveled down the long gentle river</i>
<i>of the fallopian tube,</i>

307
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:03,152
<i>and been welcomed by the warm embrace</i>
<i>of the silk-lined uterus.</i>

308
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,236
No, no, no.

309
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,866
<i>You must fertilize that precious ovum now</i>
<i>or it will disintegrate into nothingness.</i>

310
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,243
Hit the gas! Do it for Philbert!

311
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,288
[siren blaring]

312
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,207
-Pull over your vehicle, now!
-[groans]

313
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,001
Oh, fish!

314
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,631
So in conclusion, I don't think California
is the greatest state in the country.

315
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,008
But it can be.

316
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,261
{\an8}Beautifully put.
I'd like to drill down, as it were,

317
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,889
{\an8}-on the subject of fracking.
-Drill away.

318
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,808
{\an8}Now, mere hours ago
your wife, Diane Nguyen,

319
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,644
{\an8}seen here eating a messy sandwich,

320
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,272
{\an8}published an essay online
titled "The Case Against Fracking"

321
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,941
{\an8}in which she posits, quote...

322
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,861
{\an8}"If these frack-happy politicians
even knew how dangerous it was,

323
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,821
{\an8}they wouldn't allow it
in their own backyards."

324
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,698
-Diane wrote that?
-Damn.

325
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,701
{\an8}Mr. Peanutbutter,
your wife has issued a challenge.

326
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,913
{\an8}Would you allow fracking
in your own backyard?

327
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,498
{\an8}I would.

328
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,459
{\an8}Joining us now via Periscope
is Frankie Flackery,

329
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,754
{\an8}foreman and spokesyak
for Flackery Will Get You Everywhere

330
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,381
{\an8}industrial drilling company.

331
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,717
{\an8}-How are ya?
-Flackery Flack, let's talk frack.

332
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,346
{\an8}Mr. Peanutbutter has invited you
to drill on his property.

333
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,682
{\an8}-Uh--
-Will you take him up on this invitation?

334
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,726
{\an8}-I could have a team there this afternoon.
-Oh...

335
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,687
{\an8}Ready when you are, boys!

336
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,565
Sir, I apologize.
We are very eager to get home.

337
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,277
You were going 36 miles per hour.
The speed limit here...

338
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,779
is 35.

339
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,948
-Yes.
-Now, I'm no mathematician.

340
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,617
-I'm just a humble officer of the law.
-Okay.

341
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:38,539
So you tell me, is 36 below 35
or is it above 35?

342
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,457
Just write us a ticket and let us go.

343
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,502
Now, now, talking back
to Officer Meow Meow is a major no-no.

344
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,963
-[chiming]
<i>-Hello! Harvey Fierstein here.</i>

345
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,258
Oh! Who said that?
Is there another man in your vehicle?

346
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,843
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Show yourself, fiend!

347
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,720
We don't have time for this! I'm in heat!

348
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,388
Ma'am, you need to calm down!

349
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,057
Don't tell me to calm down
or call me ma'am!

350
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,477
Just write us a goddamn ticket
so I can go home and mount my boyfriend!

351
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,522
That's enough!
Out of the car, all three of you!

352
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,444
Obviously, I didn't mean you.

353
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,195
You're giving me the silent treatment?

354
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,905
I guess I have thin skin.

355
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,450
Must be the half of me
that's made of garbage.

356
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,036
[sighs] Well, who else is on this list?

357
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,081
Stacy, Fabiana... Tonya Harding?
She is not gonna be happy to see me.

358
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,417
She said sleeping with me
is the worst thing she ever did.

359
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,128
I'm sorry it's so unpleasant for you

360
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,881
to have to interact
with women you were shitty to.

361
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,758
I don't understand
why we're even doing this.

362
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,302
You're never gonna switch bodies
with your mom.

363
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,512
That ship has sailed
and is also impossible.

364
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,139
-Pull over the car.
-No.

365
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,224
-Pull over now!
-Jesus. Fine.

366
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,271
-I'm gonna do the rest of this on my own.
-No. Hollyhock.

367
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:48,442
I got the list. I don't need you anymore.
Have a bad life.

368
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,611
Joke's on you, I already have one!

369
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,492
Oh no. No. No, no.

370
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,827
Where's Mr. Peanutbutter?

371
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,705
He's giving a stump speech
on the subject of stumps.

372
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,666
-Turns out he's pro. Great for sitting.
-[groans]

373
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,252
I'd be careful with that faucet,
the water comes out very hot

374
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,337
because of the fracking.

375
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,256
Aaah! How could you let him do this?

376
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,550
You're the one who called his bluff.
Don't do that.

377
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,221
-This just makes my job harder.
-I didn't "call his bluff." I just--

378
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:21,350
Woman, you have one job:
be his wife, be supportive.

379
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,768
I <i>am </i>being supportive.

380
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,395
Was that you being supportive today
with that piece you wrote

381
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,690
-for your stupid girl website?
-It's called Girl Croosh.

382
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,277
"Stoopid Gurl" is just a subsection
of the main site.

383
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,280
And my piece wasn't about
Mr. Peanutbutter, specifically.

384
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,325
I'm gonna cut this conversation short,
my time is more important than yours.

385
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,369
This goes one of two ways.

386
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,455
Either you shut up and be pretty,
or your approximation of that,

387
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,708
or don't support him, he resents you,
your marriage implodes.

388
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,335
-Pick your poison.
-Damn!

389
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,380
Not that I get to vote, but from
one Mrs. Peanutbutter to another,

390
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,425
it's been really fun for me
to watch this new marriage fall apart.

391
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,761
-We're not.
-So thank you, Diane,

392
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,557
for that tiny sliver of mint
in the smoothie of dogshit

393
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,601
that is trying to get
that popular idiot elected.

394
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,686
Good night.

395
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,689
Damn!

396
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,482
[blaring]

397
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
-[chiming]
<i>-I'm Harvey Fierstein,</i>

398
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,199
<i>and I hope</i>
<i>you're almost done having sex</i>

399
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,994
<i>because your ovulation cycle</i>
<i>will soon be ending.</i>

400
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,162
Huh.

401
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,706
I'm sorry we couldn't get home in time.

402
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,042
-Your lawyer, he's good?
-The best.

403
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,211
Then you know what we have to do?

404
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,337
Oh!

405
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,840
-For Philbert?
-For Philbert.

406
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,550
[grunting]

407
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,927
-What are you doing back there? Hey!
-[moaning]

408
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,264
-Sorry you have to be here for this.
-Keep your eyes on the road.

409
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,807
Hey! You two cut that out!

410
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:48,896
I'll write you up for lewd conduct.
Lewd, crude and partially nude!

411
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,691
Not to mention the rude 'tude
of you two dudes, while this prude...

412
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,817
-Hey, listen to me!
-Whoa!

413
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,070
[voice of Fierstein] <i>And so the dance</i>
<i>of life continues apace.</i>

414
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,282
<i>I'm Harvey Fierstein,</i>
<i>bidding you a sexy good evening.</i>

415
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,076
[Officer Fuzzyface] No!

416
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,411
<i>Can I get my check now?</i>

417
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,330
[sighs]

418
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,458
Alone, at last. Thank God.

419
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,298
[sighs]

420
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,384
[groans] Fine, fine, fine.

421
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,638
Hi, Fabiana. Before you slam the door--

422
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,974
Did a young horse girl come by here,
about yay high?

423
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,145
You're still mad about your dad's funeral?
That was 18 years ago!

424
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,231
Thank you, Tonya.
I know we've had our differences,

425
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,650
but seeing you always leaves me
weak in the knees.

426
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,235
[groans]

427
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,991
-[grunts]
-Hollyhock.

428
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,119
-Was that her?
-Ugh! No.

429
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,622
[groans]

430
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:52,834
I talked to 23 women today
and none of them were my mother.

431
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,587
-How did you find me?
-I went to everyone on that list.

432
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,131
You talked to all those women?
Some of them--

433
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,802
-Really haven't aged well, I know.
-I was gonna say, really hate you.

434
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,304
Oh, yeah, that too.
But I needed to find you.

435
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,139
To tell you I'm sorry,

436
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,809
for being such an asshole
then and also now.

437
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:12,229
This whole thing was stupid.
I never should have come out here.

438
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,982
And I don't even care
about having a mom, really.

439
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,277
Because I did fine
for 17 years without one.

440
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,153
I don't need a mom.

441
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,697
Hollyhock, it's okay to want a mom.

442
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:27,119
No, it's not! Because that means my dads
weren't enough for me, and they are!

443
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,537
[sighs]

444
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,956
I know I just met you,
but if you do have

445
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,334
any of the old Horseman gunk
bouncing around in that brain of yours,

446
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,088
I gotta tell you right now
you should give up on looking for "enough"

447
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,549
because it will never be enough.

448
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,925
[whimpering]

449
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,760
-[sobbing]
-Eww!

450
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,722
-Stop that.
-I know, it's stupid.

451
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:52,144
-There, there.
-You are so bad at this.

452
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,104
What do your dads say when you cry?

453
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,523
They say it's okay to cry,

454
00:21:56,606 --> 00:22:00,277
and that I shouldn't feel bad
about feeling bad.

455
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,446
Well, that-- that's good advice, right?

456
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,991
They're really good dads.
I should probably get back to them.

457
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,118
Oh. You don't have to leave right away.

458
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,162
Why don't you just
stay with me a bit longer?

459
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,621
At least until we find your mom.

460
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:15,625
How are we supposed to do that?
Every name on that list was a dead end.

461
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,461
Oh...

462
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:22,841
Yeah. But what if I told you
there's a name that isn't on that list?

463
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,468
Someone Marcy never knew about.

464
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,303
What? Where is she now?

465
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,431
I don't know. But you can stay with me
while we try to find her?

466
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,725
Okay. Yeah. What's her name?

467
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,562
Her name was Brown Car... la.

468
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,023
Carla Mercedes Benz... Brown.

469
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:42,152
"Carla Mercedes Benzbrown"?
Weird name.

470
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,780
-You've got a weird name.
-I guess you're right.

471
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,324
Maybe that's the first thing
we'll talk about when I meet her.

472
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,950
Mm-hmm?

473
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,246
[keyboard clicking]

474
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,334
Diane, I know. I'm sorry about the trucks,
but you didn't give me much choice.

475
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,587
I know these last few days
have been crazy.

476
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,381
-But this is the hard part.
-I need you to drop out of the race.

477
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,383
-What?
-Please, Mr. Peanutbutter.

478
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,468
This isn't worth it.

479
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,261
I hear what you're saying

480
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,890
and I will try to be more conscientious
of your needs.

481
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,184
-Drop out of the race.
-Because your needs are important.

482
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,269
I've written another piece
for Girl Croosh.

483
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,730
It's called
"The Case Against Mr. Peanutbutter."

00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,816
When I hit this button,
the post goes live.

485
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,983
Diane, don't.

486
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,612
I don't want to.
And I won't, if you drop out of the race.

487
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,864
Jesus, Diane. You can't do that.

488
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,742
Because you're the only one allowed
to make decisions for this family?

489
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,495
No. Because it's gonna come off
as a weird lovers' spat

490
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,497
and it's just going to embarrass everyone.

491
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,959
-Well, I'm sorry if I embarrass you.
-Oh, come on.

492
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,294
You told me you weren't going to frack,
and now I can't

493
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:45,090
turn on a faucet in my own home
without getting third-degree burns.

494
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,552
Oh, I get it. So like always,
you're mad at someone,

495
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,848
so your solution is to air
your dirty laundry for everyone to see.

496
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:57,477
No. This is not about <i>us.</i>
I don't want <i>you </i>to be governor

497
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:01,815
because you would be bad at it,
because you don't stand for anything.

Hey!

501
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,575
Don't you dare.
Robert Blake gave me that mug.
