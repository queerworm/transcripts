00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,521
-Come on, we gotta go!
-[stammers] Okay.

168
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,566
-[pops, whistles]
-[Todd] Whoa! Ho-oh!

169
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,529
Oh, wow! That's like a 3-D one!

170
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,988
[BoJack] So...

171
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,573
why did we need to be on the beach?

172
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,117
Oh, you just seemed
really overwhelmed at the party.

173
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,204
-I thought you could use some air.
-Oh. Thanks.

174
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,331
But then why are you on my shoulders?

175
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,458
So I could get
a better view of the fireworks.

176
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,128
-Okay, get down. Oh, okay.
-[grunting]

177
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,380
It's good to see you.

178
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,173
How'd you get out of the supermax?

179
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,676
Did a helicopter crash
into the side of the building

180
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,094
and then you just walked out?

181
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,180
What? No. I'm just here for the wedding.
I'm going back tomorrow.

182
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,515
Oh, bummer.

183
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,434
No, it's good.
I think the routine is good for me.

184
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:25,439
-I'm staying out of trouble, at least.
-Hooray! Staying out of trouble, at least!

185
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,441
I'm trying to set little goals for myself.

186
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,486
Like, in a couple months,
I'll beat my record for being sober.

187
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,196
-Nice!
-Yeah, so that's...

188
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,576
that's something to aim for,
but then, uh, after that, um...

189
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,078
After that, you'll beat your record again.

190
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,122
Every day, you'll set a new record.

191
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,708
Sure. But it's easy now. In jail.

192
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,876
I don't have to
make any choices for myself.

193
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,170
I worry about what's gonna happen
when I get out.

194
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,132
-What if I relapse again?
-Then you'll get sober again.

195
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,342
-[groans]
-Let me tell you something.

196
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,760
I was at the office the other day,

197
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,263
doing the "Hokey Pokey"
with some work associates...

198
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,848
-Uh-huh.
-...and I realized

199
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,891
everyone misunderstands that song.

200
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,934
"The Hokey Pokey"?

201
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,646
Yeah, there's way too much emphasis
on the "hokey pokey" part.

202
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,523
That is what it's all about.

203
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,108
No. That's exactly what I mean.

204
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,235
-That's not what the song is saying.
-Okay.

205
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:15,698
And I was thinking about my mom,
you know, my relationship with my mom.

206
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,367
It's weird. You know, awkward.

207
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,371
I feel like she doesn't really get me,
but, you know, she's trying.

208
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,372
And a couple years ago,

209
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,251
I never thought I would have
any kind of relationship with her.

210
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,419
Like, I was sure of it.

211
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,378
What changed?

212
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,215
I don't know. I did? Or-- Or she did?

213
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,594
Or, um, we... are?

214
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,513
-Huh.
-So, that's what I'm talking about.

215
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,015
It's like the song says.

216
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,644
"You do the hokey pokey
and you turn yourself around."

217
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,939
You turn yourself around.
That's what it's all about.

218
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,901
Yeah, I don't know if the songwriters
put that much thought

219
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,153
into the existential significance
of the lyrics.

220
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,322
They literally rhyme "about" with "about."

221
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,949
But isn't the point of art
less what people put into it

222
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,702
and more what people get out of it?

223
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,829
-Is that the point of art?
-Maybe.

224
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:08,334
Or maybe art doesn't need a point.
Maybe that's why it's called art.

225
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,878
I can't tell
if you're being smart or stupid.

226
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,338
Oh, I never know.

227
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,924
I think you had it for a moment
and then you lost it.

228
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,008
[chuckles]

229
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,470
Oh, well!
It was nice while it lasted, right?

230
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,641
Sure. It was nice while it lasted.

231
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,352
[fireworks popping, whistling]

232
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,107
[upbeat music playing]

233
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,108
Ugh!

234
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,195
Huh! Not bad.

235
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,155
Hey, there he is!

236
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,324
Oh, my God,
that was an incredible wedding.

237
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,659
Yeah? It wasn't too much

238
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,744
with the fireworks,
and the cirque performers,

239
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,621
and the procession of exotic peafowl?

240
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,832
No, you produced the hell out of it.

241
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,418
What'd you think about the part
where the priest got murdered

242
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,587
and Judah had to figure out
which bridesmaid was the culprit?

243
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,589
A little outside the box,
as far as weddings go,

244
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,882
but it worked in context.

245
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,426
I thought so, too!

246
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,762
Congratulations.
And Judah, too. Where is he?

247
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,598
I think he's going over some contracts.

248
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,434
We're putting together
an all-female reboot

249
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,685
of <i>12 Angry Men.</i>

250
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,855
It's called "11 Angry Women."

251
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,524
-Not 12?
-You gotta leave room for a sequel.

252
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,986
So your groom is doing paperwork
during his own wedding reception?

253
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,906
Oh, we had our real wedding a week ago.
This one's just for the industry.

254
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,159
-What?
-I invited the town's top talent,

255
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,619
took away their phones,
and shuffled them together.

256
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,163
Give 'em some booze, get 'em chatty,

257
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,831
next day, they're calling me,

258
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,791
"Hey, could you put me in touch
with so-and-so?"

259
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,878
-Boom! I've attached myself as a producer!
-Does that really work?

260
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:38,215
Hey, Jennifer Jason Leigh!
Have you met regular Jason Lee?

261
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,719
You're my two favorite Jason Lees.
Discuss.

262
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,555
Well, I am offended I wasn't
important enough for your real wedding,

263
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,641
but I'm flattered I'm important enough
for your industry one.

264
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,728
Are you kidding?
"Horny Unicorn" is tracking huge.

265
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,229
-What?
-All of Hollywoob

266
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,814
is buzzing about your comeback.

267
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,025
No. Did you say "Hollywoob"?

268
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,068
If this movie does what it's supposed to,

269
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,822
the district attorney's not the only one
who's gonna wanna lock you into something.

270
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,824
I'm not sure
I should take on more projects.

271
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,203
I started this drama program at prison
and we're doing <i>Hedda Gabler.</i>

272
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,164
I mean, it's not Strindberg,
but, you know, we're having a good time.

273
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,083
I thought that maybe when I got out,
I could go back and volunteer.

274
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,835
Oh! Well, that sounds fabulous!

275
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,838
Yeah, but... [stammers] I didn't even
think that I'd have other options.

276
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,799
A year ago,
everyone in this town hated me.

277
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,217
People have short memories.

278
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,719
It's the best and worst thing
about people.

279
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,930
Well, maybe there's a way I could do both?

280
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,765
-I've really enjoyed teaching.
-Oh! Oh.

281
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,141
Maybe I could direct something?

282
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,477
-I'm sorry I said anything. I--
-Well, I mean, hold on.

283
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,479
Yeah, I shouldn't
just jump into something,

284
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,774
but if there's a good opportunity,
I'd be stupid not to take it, right?

285
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,235
I mean, we both know how hard it is
to get heat in this town.

286
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,612
Think it over.
I'm sure you'll make the right decision.

287
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,823
Well, a decision.

288
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,325
[soft music playing]

289
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,579
-Hey, you wanna dance?
-Yeah.

290
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,252
-What?
-Oh! Aw.

291
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,837
[both chuckle]

292
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,423
You know, I had this weird idea
when I heard you were getting married

293
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,760
that I'd get here
and there'd be some disaster,

294
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,639
and I knew that either I would cause it
or, just maybe,

295
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,516
I would be the only one who could fix it.

296
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,725
A disaster, huh?

297
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,354
Not like a "disaster" disaster,
like a sitcom disaster, you know?

298
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,274
Like, it would be time for the wedding
and no one would know where to find you.

299
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,276
-No one but you, right?
-Yeah.

300
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,989
And I'd find you in some special spot
and I'd say, "Come on, it's time to go."

301
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,491
And you'd say,
"What am I doing, BoJack?"

302
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,578
[chuckles] And then what,
I'd run off with you?

303
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,621
No, I would talk you
into going through with it,

304
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,708
and it would be like a symbol
of how much I'd grown,

305
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,418
that I could let you go.

306
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,295
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

307
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,713
No, I mean, I'm happy for you.

308
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,257
Just... it's a better story
if you had cold feet.

309
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,011
It's a better story for you.
I think I like it better this way.

310
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,679
I guess you're right.

311
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,056
What would you have said to me?

312
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,934
Oh, I don't know. I would have said, uh,

313
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,521
-"Come on, man. Do it."
-[chuckles] Oh, wow.

314
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,066
No, no, no. I would-- Okay. Hold on.
Tell me what you're afraid of.

315
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,029
In this make-believe scenario
that you came up with?

316
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,822
-Yeah.
-Okay.

317
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,534
Well, I guess I'm afraid
of losing some part of myself.

318
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,079
I'm afraid that if I let someone else
take care of me

319
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,956
that I'm not really me anymore.

320
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,418
I'm afraid of getting too comfortable,
you know, going soft.

321
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:23,464
I'm afraid that this could be
the best thing that ever happened to me

322
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:27,009
and if it doesn't make me
as happy as I'm supposed to be,

323
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,762
that means I'm a lost cause.

324
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,472
-Holy shit.
-What?

325
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,807
I don't know,
those are some really good arguments.

326
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,893
-Are you kidding me?!
-Okay, okay, look.

327
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,312
Yes, all those things could be true,
but on the other hand,

328
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,148
what if you deserve to be happy

329
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,817
and this is a thing
that will make you happy?

330
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,196
And maybe don't worry
about whether you'll be happy later

331
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,949
and just focus
on how you're happy right now?

332
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,242
-Oh, is it that easy?
-No.

333
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,036
But you're here because, at some point,

334
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,747
Princess Carolyn thought
this was a good idea.

335
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,249
And I think we oughta listen to her.

336
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,669
Because she's the smartest woman I know.

337
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,754
That's true. She is.

338
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,465
So, what do you think?
Are you gonna marry him?

339
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,135
Well, I already got the dress.

340
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,138
But you didn't need me
to say any of that, did you?

341
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,682
I guess I didn't.

342
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,851
Hey, if I do decide
to get back into the business

343
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,228
when I get out of prison...

344
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,106
I mean, I probably won't, but if I do,

345
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,858
I'm gonna need representation.

346
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,404
Someone who can look out for me,
help me make the right decisions,

347
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,863
keep me out of trouble...

348
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,158
I can recommend some excellent people.

349
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,246
[sighs]

350
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,501
[muffled music playing]

351
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:46,588
[inhales, exhales]

352
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,925
Hey.

353
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,512
-Thought I might find you here.
-I'm trying to quit.

354
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,764
Yeah, you look like
you're trying really hard.

355
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,224
Don't be shitty.

356
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,477
I haven't seen you in a while.
You doing okay?

357
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,229
Yeah, I'm doing okay.

358
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,898
-I mean, you know, okay.
-Sure.

359
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,568
I'm working
on this middle-grade fiction series.

360
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,862
[chuckles] I mean, who am I, Rick Riordan?

361
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,196
Who's Rick Riordan?

362
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,366
Yeah, good point.
What have you been up to?

363
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,286
Well, let's see, um,
I've been getting into podcasts,

364
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,121
went through a Sudoku phase, and, uh,

365
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,749
-oh, I'm in prison, so...
-Right. That's still happening?

366
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,002
Oh, it's very much happening.
I've also got a new movie coming out.

367
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,670
Oh, yeah, with Vance Waggoner, right?

368
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,338
I know what you're thinking, but he's--

369
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,007
You don't need to explain yourself to me.

370
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,967
I know you think
I'm some kind of a sell-out,

371
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,595
but it wasn't like other opportunities
were banging down my door...

372
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,889
-I'm not arguing with you.
-Because of "Horny Unicorn"--

373
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,017
I'm not going to help you work through
whatever you're trying to work through.

374
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,269
I just came out here to smoke.
You came to me.

375
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,147
-Because I wanted to talk to you.
-About what? "The Horny Unicorn"?

376
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,274
No, about-- I don't know.

377
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:51,987
I just wanted to talk to you.
[stammers] I miss talking to you.

378
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,240
[cigarette sizzles]

379
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,659
I wish I had my phone right now.

380
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,994
Yeah, I know what you mean.

381
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,871
I never know what to do
with my hands at parties.

382
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,664
No, I wish I had my phone

383
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,542
so I could play you
the last voicemail you left me.

384
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,462
Did you remember that,
that you left me a voicemail?

385
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,422
[inhales] Ooh.

386
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,383
I thought you were sober.
You told me you were sober.

387
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,637
And things were good in my life
and I was thinking about my future,

388
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,807
and then I woke up one morning
and I had this voicemail.

389
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,016
Look, I-I wasn't in the--

390
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,103
You were happy on the voicemail.
You sounded happy.

391
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,230
Or lightly sardonic, or glibly nihilistic,

392
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,107
or however you'd describe
that thing you get

393
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,359
that's the closest to the emotion
normal people call happy.

394
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,569
-I'm sorry--
-And you were clearly intoxicated,

395
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,823
and you were talking about swimming.
"I'm going swimming," you said.

396
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,408
"Since nothing matters anyway,
and nobody cares about me,

397
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,369
-I might as well go swimming, right?"
-I'm so sorry.

398
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,663
"Call me back
if you don't want me to go swimming.

399
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,207
Otherwise, I'm just gonna assume
you don't care."

400
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,919
I thought you were dead.

401
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,296
For seven hours,
I couldn't get in touch with anyone

402
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,714
and I was sure you were dead,

403
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,594
and it was my fault for leaving you,
for feeling good, for not worrying.

404
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,014
When I left for Chicago,
you promised me you were gonna be okay,

405
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,642
but I made you promise me that.

406
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,395
-Was I selfish for believing you?
-No.

407
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,480
Why did you call me?
You knew I was in Chicago.

408
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,316
I don't know. I was drunk
and-- and I was high.

409
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,985
And I just... I wanted to talk to you.

410
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,949
When I found out you weren't dead,
I was angry.

411
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:24,872
I was relieved, but I was also angry
that I'd given you that power over me.

412
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,333
I was angry at you for a really long time.

413
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,252
Are you still angry at me?

414
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,381
No. I don't know.
What good has being angry at you

415
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,008
-ever done for me?
-I'm sorry.

416
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,218
I wish I could have been
the person you thought I was,

417
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,470
-the person who would save you.
-That was never your job.

418
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,266
Then why did you always make me
feel like it was?

419
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,686
I don't know, maybe it's everybody's job
to save each other.

420
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,396
I don't know.

421
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,525
Anyway, I'm glad you're alive.

422
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,943
I am, too.

423
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,907
So, you're still in Chicago, then, or...?

424
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,076
When I got that voicemail,

425
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,457
my boyfriend at the time
wanted me to move to Houston with him.

426
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,334
I wanted to move with him.

427
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,253
But after you called, I got scared.

428
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,547
-Oh, no.
-I didn't trust myself.

429
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,301
I was happy and I didn't trust that.
So I stayed in Chicago.

430
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:24,056
We tried to make it work long distance,
but it was hard.

431
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,017
Eventually, I just thought,
"This is stupid."

432
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,144
So, what, you broke up with him?

433
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,605
No. I moved to Houston.

434
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,315
To be with your boyfriend at the time?

435
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,859
Yeah. Plus, the winters in Chicago
are cold as shit,

436
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,569
I don't know why anyone
would build a city there.

437
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,154
No wonder that cow started that fire.

438
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,948
I get it. I'm on Team Cow.

439
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,701
But your boyfriend at the time,
he's not your boyfriend anymore?

440
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,537
He is not.

441
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,249
-Wow.
-Yeah.

442
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,002
How'd you learn how to trust it?
The happiness?

443
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,880
I didn't. But I trust him.

444
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,927
It's hard to imagine you in Houston.

445
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,887
Oh, I'm like
a totally different person now.

446
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,305
-Are you?
-No?

447
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,935
Yes? I wear fewer jackets.
I smile more.

448
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,981
Sometimes I look back at my LA years,
and I think, "Who was that person?"

449
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,483
Does she ever come back, that Diane?

450
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,360
Sometimes.

451
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,487
I felt her when I got back to LA.

452
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,198
I feel her now that I'm talking to you.

453
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,783
But it's not you?

454
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,743
I mean, it's all me.

455
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,871
I'd love to say,
"No, she's gone forever."

456
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,625
But I was terrified
of coming back here for the wedding.

457
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,628
-Seeing Mr. Peanutbutter. Seeing you.
-What'd you think was gonna happen?

458
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,841
I don't know, I would spin out,
start questioning everything,

459
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:41,842
blow everything up.

460
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,428
But that didn't happen, did it?

461
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,430
No. That didn't happen.

462
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,516
But was part of you
kinda hoping that it would?

463
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,059
Mm.

464
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,145
You ever miss the mess?

465
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,272
No, "miss" is the wrong word.

466
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,024
Sorry, Miss.

467
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,527
I'm glad I lived in LA,
but I'm not nostalgic for it.

468
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,196
I'm glad I knew Mr. Peanutbutter,

469
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,532
-even though he's not in my life anymore.
-Yeah?

470
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:09,453
I think there are people that help you
become the person that you end up being,

471
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,747
and you can be grateful for them

472
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,167
even if they were never
meant to be in your life forever.

473
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,711
I'm glad I knew you, too.

474
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,171
"Knew," huh?

475
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,255
Mm.

476
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,924
Hey, wouldn't it be funny

477
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,927
if this night was the last time
we ever talked to each other?

478
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,559
-Um, anyway, I--
-I need to tell you...

479
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,227
No. You don't have to--
You don't owe me anything.

480
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,897
No, I need to tell you: Thank you.

481
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,567
And it's going to be okay.

482
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,528
And I'm sorry.

483
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,324
And... [softly] thank you.

484
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,370
-Wait.
-Why?

485
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,955
I know. I know.
But can I just tell you a funny story?

486
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,165
Sure.

487
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,751
But it better be very funny.

488
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,504
I don't wanna lie to you,
it's only kind of funny.

489
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,674
So we have this movie night
at the prison, right?

490
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,386
And we get to vote
on what movies we wanna see.

491
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,179
But of course the whole thing's rigged,

492
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,557
because Big Andy's favorite movie
is <i>The Family Stone,</i>

493
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,268
so Big Andy gets his guys
to vote for it every week,

494
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,771
and so every week
we watch <i>The Family Stone.</i>

495
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,899
Hold on, whose favorite movie
is <i>The Family Stone?</i>

496
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,651
I mean, yeah, it's a fine movie...

497
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,194
-But every week?
-That's what I'm saying!

498
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,572
So, one day I'm like, "If I see
Luke Wilson teach Sarah Jessica Parker

499
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,700
how to let her freak flag fly
one more time, I'm gonna snap."

500
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,036
I don't understand,
is movie night mandatory?

501
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,955
-No.
-So why don't you just not go?

502
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,998
What am I, a philistine?
I support the arts, sue me.

503
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,125
Okay, sorry.

504
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,086
But I know a guy
who volunteers in the library,

505
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,464
which is where they keep the DVDs,
so I make a deal with him.

506
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:48,385
"I'll give you my Jell-O for a month
if <i>The Family Stone</i> goes missing."

507
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,928
I feel like this doesn't end well.

508
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,973
So, movie might comes around,
time for another Christmas in Connecticut,

509
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,685
but then, uh-oh, the DVD's gone,
what do we do?

510
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,729
So Big Andy's getting really upset,
and his guys are all riled,

511
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,398
and then I go, "Fellas, fellas, fellas!

512
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,775
Why don't we watch
<i>Pieces of April </i>this week?

513
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,069
Change of pace.
Patricia Clarkson's in it and..."

514
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:06,987
And?

515
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,156
-Prison riot.
-Oh, shit, really?

516
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,117
No. Worse. Big Andy falls in love
with <i>Pieces of April,</i>

517
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,161
so now we watch<i> Pieces of April</i>
every week.

518
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,746
[chuckles] You kind of made your own bed
on that one.

519
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,373
Story of my life.

520
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,586
[chuckles]

521
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,297
I'm sorry, that sounds awful.

522
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,633
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?
Life's a bitch and then you die, right?

523
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,177
Sometimes.

524
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,096
Sometimes life's a bitch
and then you keep living.

525
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,181
Yeah.

526
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,643
But it's a nice night, huh?

527
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,145
Yeah.

528
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,898
This is nice.

529
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,233
