00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,469

9
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:35,410
I'm thrilled to be talking
to the star of the film,

10
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,413
BoJack Horseman, and his
real life inspiration,

11
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,623
Mr. Peanutbutter.

12
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,333
Am I an inspiration?

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,960
Well, that depends
on how you define--

14
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,337
- Wait a minute. Yes, I am.
- Ugh.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,506
You know, I'm just over
the moon to be producing

16
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,009
this movie
about my daring exploit.

17
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,012
- Yes, your<i> </i>daring exploit.
- Yes.

18
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,806
It's such a treat to be
shooting in my very own <i>casa.</i>

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,685
And it's an even sweeter treat
to be played by my good <i>amigo--</i>

20
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,269
dare I say best <i>amigo?</i>

21
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,146
- You "daren't."
- We're so in tune.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,985
We even finish each other's...

23
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,904
sentences.

24
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,279
Sometimes it doesn't happen.

25
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,447
- It never--
- Happens.

26
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,075
Ah, see?
I'm inside him.

27
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,327
BoJack, you haven't worked
in quite some time.

28
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,204
In fact,
I thought you were dead.

29
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,332
You must be so grateful to be
working again and also alive,

30
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,376
which, again,
I thought you were not.

31
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,794
How did you get involved
with this?

32
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,046
Well--

33
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,213
You want me to play
Mr. Peanutbutter

34
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,008
in the story he stole from me?

35
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,384
I stole the D,

36
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,344
and then he stole
my stealing of it.

37
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,847
That makes him an idea thief,
which is much less cool

38
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,849
than a thief thief,
which is what I am

39
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:39,934
and what he also is.

40
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,393
You know what might help?

41
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,853
If you think about this
like a professional

42
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,479
instead of a big titty baby.

43
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,648
This movie is
a huge opportunity.

44
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:50,151
Quentin Tarantulino is known
for revitalizing dead careers.

45
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,153
This could do for you
what <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>

46
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,488
did for Rin Tin Tin.

47
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,115
But isn't there
any other part?

48
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,867
I could play myself.

49
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,036
No, BoJack's already being
played by Wallace Shawn.

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,662
What? The short guy
from <i>The Princess Bride</i>

51
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,997
who says "inconceivable"?

52
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:04,332
- Why Wallace Shawn?
- BoJack Horseman?

53
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,709
I don't want to play
that boob.

54
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,335
I'm trying to help
you out, Wally.

55
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,964
You're the one who keeps
buying expensive Rothkos.

56
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,715
I have a disease.

57
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,094
Would you tell an alcoholic
to stop buying alcohol?

58
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,220
You know,
<i>Black and Blue Number 7's</i>

59
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,764
going up for auction next week.

60
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,307
Fine.
I'll do the dumb movie.

61
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,101
Fine.
I'll do the dumb movie.

62
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,352
But if you find me in a bathtub
with open wrists tomorrow

63
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,814
and the words "I hate my agent"
smeared across the walls

64
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,565
in blood, you'll know why.

65
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,193
So obviously I'm thrilled
to be here, just thrilled.

85
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,243
Well, I've been pretty busy.
Met a girl at Soho House.

86
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,870
- Was she your waitress?
- Yes.

87
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,413
Then I met a girl at Mastro's.

88
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,998
- Was she also your waitress?
- Yes.

89
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,290
Then I met a girl
at P.F. Chang's.

90
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,834
Let me guess.
She was your--

91
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,836
A hooker, yes,
but what she really wants to do

92
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,588
- is wait tables.
- [laughs]

93
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,631
Well, I, for one,
would love to meet

94
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,008
the aspiring food-service worker

95
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,843
who finally gets you
to settle down.

96
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,929
{\an8}What?
Why would I want to settle down?

97
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,264
{\an8}I'm 50.

98
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,725
- Yeah, anyway...
- So I'm sending the first draft

99
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,268
of the book to Pinky
this afternoon.

100
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,854
- What? It's done?
- Not yet. Almost.

101
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,523
I'm excited for you to read it,

102
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,525
{\an8}but I'm also
cripplingly nervous.

103
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,485
{\an8}I actually kind of feel
like throwing up,

104
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,279
{\an8}but I can't throw up because
I haven't had anything to eat

105
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,448
because this lady won't let me
in my own kitchen.

107
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,202
{\an8}Listen, if reading a book
you wrote is anywhere near

108
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,412
{\an8}as great as it is
to actually spend time with you,

109
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,539
{\an8}I'm sure
it's gonna be wonderful.

110
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,666
{\an8}Having said that,
what do I know about books?

111
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,668
I'm just a dumb actor.

112
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,924
{\an8}I'm here with Hollywoo darling
Naomi Watts.

113

{\an8}Tell me, what attracted you
to the role of Diane?

114
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,095
{\an8}I just keep getting
pigeonholed

115
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,639
{\an8}as these complex characters
in highly acclaimed movies.

116
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,724
{\an8}For once, I would just love
to phone it in

117
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,768
{\an8}and play a two-dimensional girl
in a rom com

118
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,561
{\an8}with no inner life of her own.

119
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,981
{\an8}That's kind of the reason
I got into this business.

120
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,941
Ha ha!
You said words.

121
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,486
{\an8}Now, is it true you stay
in character between takes?

122
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,197
{\an8}Oh, we all do.
The director insists upon it.

123
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,908

calling me Diane

in the headspace.

00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,495

Right over here, Q.

132
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,838
No, I'm looking
for peanut butter.

133
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,338
Oh, you mean BoJack?

134
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,300
If I wanted BoJack,
I would call BoJack.

135
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,302
Did someone call for BoJack?

136
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,180
It really cuts
down on confusion.

137
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,810
Ah, show business,
the great equalizer.

138
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,520
Is that what it is?

139
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,147

140

No, sir, Mr. Peanutbutter.

You see the problem.

160
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,148
- I do not.
- I just think if we're telling

161
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,317
the story, we should tell it
how it really happened.

162
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,694
Yeah, this whole story
isn't how it really happened.

163
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,571
Right...

164
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,031
because of the shirts.

165
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,699
Because I'm the one
who stole the D.

166
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,034
I'm the real hero here.

167
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,702
My life is full
of exciting adventures.

168
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,786
I should write a book.

169
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,454
Oh, wait.
I did.

170
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,082
Suck on that, society.

171
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,624
Hey, you're in a mood.

172
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,335
Perhaps the tightness
of that crew neck

173
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,419
is cutting off circulation
to the brain?

174
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,130
Let me talk to Donna
in wardrobe.

175
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,631
We're gonna fix this, buddy.

176
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,716
Donna!

177
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,554
What are you doing?

178
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,724
I'm just trying to get inside
my character, which is you.

179
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,226
Is this how we move our arms?

180
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,685
We're so weird.

181
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,978
Is this really necessary?

182
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,605
Is this really necessary?

183
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,898
That's not what I sound like.

184
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,733
That's not mut
mi sound mike.

185
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,735
Hey, what's it been like
since we got married?

186
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,113
Is it everything we dreamed
of since we were little?

187
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,031
When I was little,
I dreamed of getting

188
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,158
a MacArthur grant for my 'zine
about how all the girls

189
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,659
at school were bitches.

190
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,121
- Oh.
- Look, the wedding was great.

191
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,164
But that's not real life.

192
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,791
I mean,
I guess I got a happy ending,

193
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,793
but every happy ending
has the day after

194
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,044
the happy ending, right?

195
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,254
And the day after that.

196
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,589
So the wedding was so much fun.

197
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,091
It was the happiest day
of my life.

198
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,675
But, you know,
what does that say

199
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,761
about all the days
I have left?

200
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:50,971
Whoa.

201
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,308
We're such a Zoe.

202
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,185
Oh, Todd, glad you're here.

203
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,270
Hold this.

204
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,147
Todd, my jacket
is on the floor.

205
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,522
You're supposed to hold
the jacket

206
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,108
so it doesn't go on the floor.

207
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,445
Hey, sorry, BoJack--
I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.

208
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,905
But I work
for Mr. Peanutbutter now.

209
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,825
- I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Ugh.

210
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,452
I can't believe
I'm on a movie set, you know?

211
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,121
I mean, this is my first chance
to work on something big

212
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,790
since my rock opera
fell apart.

213
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,252
Man, I really messed up
that huge career opportunity

214
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,420
all on my own, didn't I?

215
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,545
Uh...

216
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:29,926
Nothing sabotaged me one bit.

217
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,011
Yep.

218
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,095
You said it.

219
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,639
Well, see you later.

220
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,891
[indistinct chatter]

221
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,352
Where can I grab a nosh?

222
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,395
Oh, craft services
is in the kitchen.

223
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,481
Up the driveway, through
the living room, make a left.

224
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,524
- Can't miss it.
- I'm gonna grab a quick bite.

225
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,027
Don't do anything stupid
while I'm gone.

226
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,279
Okay, fellas, here's the thing
about the story.

227
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,655
I don't buy it.

228
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,115
It's like something's missing,

229
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,741
but I can't put
any of my fingers on it.

230
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,827
Um, maybe once
we add the music--

231
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,037
The music?
Are you kidding me?

232
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,330
Music?
You're fired.

233
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,580
What dumb shit brought
this dumb shit?

234
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,665
Okay, you're fired too.

235
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,042
Oh, okay.

236
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,669
Anyone else
got any bright ideas?

237
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,046
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

238
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,965
Hey, maybe it make it
more Diane-y?

239
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,009
- Um, excuse me?
- I don't know.

240
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,220
This is probably stupid,
but the whole story's

241
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,514
about how this guy's
in love with this lady, right?

242
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,892
But we don't even know
who she is or what she wants.

243
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,353
I mean, maybe give her
more lines or words

244
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,688
or, I don't know,
feelings or whatever?

245
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,772
What?

246
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,774
He's new.
He doesn't know the rules.

247
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,152
Forgive him, mighty Caesar.

248
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,575
Yes. Yeah.

249
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,659
I love you.

250
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,744
Who is this kid?

251
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,079
You're a genius.

252
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,247
- I'm gonna kiss your face.
- What?

253
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,249
Oh!
[laughs]

254
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,666
Come back to my web.

255
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,085
Let's talk
about Diane's feelings

256
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,545
and make this baby sing.

257
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,047
Hey, Todd, talk to him
about the wardrobe,

258
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,049
specifically the top half
of the wardrobe,

259
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,927
specifically the shirt part
of the top half of the wardrobe,

260
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,180
specifically the neck part of
the shirt part of the wardrobe.

261
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,224
[cell phone rings]

262
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,683
Ugh.
What now?

263
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,477
I'm sick
of this dog and pony show.

264
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,062
The movie is dumb.

265
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,813
Mr. Peanutbutter is annoying
the shit out of me,

266
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,441
and there's too much honeydew
in the fruit bowl.

267
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,109
Blech. Honeydew
is garbage fruit.

268
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,319
Also, why is BoJack
being played by an old, nebbishy

269
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,404
five-foot-tall bald guy?

270
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,821
Is that how the world sees me?

271
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:14,906
Oh, I see.

272
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,325
So I can play
<i>Vanya on 42nd Street,</i>

273
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,328
but I'm not a deft-enough talent
to capture the essence

274
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,414
of the elusive
BoJack Horseman.

275
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:26,501
So sorry to offend you, sir.

276
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,420
I'm just glad my book's
coming out soon

277
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,380
so people will get
an opportunity to see

278
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,923
the real BoJack Horseman.

279
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,550
Oh, are you coming out
with a book?

280
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,842
You never mentioned it.

281
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,094
Plus,
Todd's being super weird.

282
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,220
I think he's onto me.

283
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,346
Onto you in regards to what?

284
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,056
Oh, right, I didn't tell you.

285
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,725
I sabotaged his rock opera
by getting him readdicted

286
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,769
to a video game because
I didn't want him to move out.

287
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,521
Jesus Christ, BoJack.

288
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,731
Anyway, I think he knows
and might be plotting

289
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,191
to sabotage me back.

290
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,068
Why is it that 90%
of our conversations

291
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,279
these days revolve around
plotting sabotages?

292
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,989
Are you saying I should
plot a countersabotage?

293
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,865
No, no more plotting.

294
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,160
Just be a good soldier
and do your job.

295
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,536
Nobody is out to get you.

296
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,621
[cell phone beeps]

297
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,289
Have you seen the new draft?

298
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,374
They took it all off you
and put it on me.

299
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,750
What?

300
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,253
Apparently some dickweed
named Todd

301
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,547
decided I should be
three-dimensional

302
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,466
and you should have no lines.

303
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,510
Ugh. Isn't this town sick
of creating

304
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,803
three-dimensional roles
for women?

305
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,639
This happens to me
all the time!

306
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,766
A.O. Scott is sick of talking
about how brilliant I am.

307
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,935
Todd.

308
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,728
I guess
what I've been saying

309
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,731
for the last
seven uninterrupted minutes is,

310
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,735
how can I forgive my father
if I can't forgive myself?

311
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,363
True dat.

312
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,698
But none of that matters,
because we bring out

313
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,451
the best in each other.

314
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:46,122
I'm the chocolate,
and you're Mr. Peanutbutter!

315
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,291
- True dat.
- Mwah!

316
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,168
Cut!
Amazing.

317
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,253
This is the movie
that I wanted to make.

318
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,338
This is gonna be great.

319
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,215
- Oh, my God, I'm so--
- Ugh, what kind of idiot

320
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,676
puts food on top of a hill?

321
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,595
Hey, so I guess now that
the movie's all about Diane,

322
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,640
I really need to dig deep
and get to know the real you.

323
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,268
So let's talk and talk
and talk until I am you

324
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,229
and you are nothing
but a hollowed-out husk

325
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,856
of your former self and every
thought and every feeling

326
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,734
you ever had belongs to me
and me alone.

327
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,573
So do we like Sprite,
or are we more of a 7-Up girl?

328
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,242
Uh, that all sounds great.

329
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,827
But, you know, the person
you should really be talking to

330
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,580
is that guy.

331
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,831
- Yeah, okay, I'm done.
- Diane loves talking to him.

332
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,417
They have great rapport.

333
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,045
In fact, Diane could spend
all day talking to him

334
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,631
and never talk to me again.

335
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:41,094
Oh, I get it, because Diane
doesn't talk to Diane.

336
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,222
- Diane talks to--
- Anybody else.

337
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,806
Hey, Todd,
remember that time

338
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,434
when you wouldn't clean
up your shit?

339
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,893
That was hilarious.

340
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,895
- We've had some good times.
- Oh. Hi.

341
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,731
So I was thinking,
I have some...

342
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,692
[sighs] pretty sloppy seconds
left over from P.F. Chang's

343
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,985
in the fridge, and I don't think
that I want it anymore.

344
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,320
Maybe tonight you could eat it.

345
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,947
Friendly gesture
because we're friends.

346
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,990
- Uh...
- Oh-oh, there's my guy.

347
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,243
I heard you had a few more
thoughts about the script.

348
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,327
I do.

349
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,080
I was just thinking, what if
we made the BoJack character

350
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,124
into a real shithead?

351
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,334
- Is that really necessary?
- I don't think it's necessary.

352
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:17,046
Yeah, let's-- Let's make him
be a real selfish asshole

353
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,299
so the audience has someone
to root against.

354
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,675
You're probably right.

355
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,968
Let's take another swing
at the script

356
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,511
and give BoJack more to do.

357
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,054
Now, when you say,
"Give BoJack more to do"--

358
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,598
Not now, Mr. Peanutbutter.

359
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,558
And also,
now that I'm thinking about it,

360
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:32,353
why does the movie
have to take place on Earth?

361
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,064
You are blowing my head.

362
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,941
- I hope you like Oscars.
- Honeydew?

363
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,068
More like,
"Honey, do I enjoy eating it?

364
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,987
Yes, I do." Right?

365
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,072
Not right, and I would love to
go through all the reasons why,

366
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,616
but I've got bigger concerns
right now.

367
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,825
- Honeydew, go on.
- Did you notice

368
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,620
that the Mr. Peanutbutter part
has been cut in half?

369
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,331
- What is happening to our movie?
- I thought you hated the movie.

370
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,291
Yeah, I do, but if I'm
gonna be in a dumb movie

371
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,709
I hate that makes no sense,

372
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,461
I should at least
be the star of it.

373
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,922
Look, I agree that this movie
has really lost its way.

374
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,342
I mean, first of all,
why would Mr. Peanutbutter

375
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,177
wear a crew neck T-shirt?

376
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,845
And second of all, uh...

377
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,306
It's just the shirt,
isn't it?

378
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,557
It doesn't make sense.

379
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,891
I'm a V-neck man.

380
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,686
A V you can put
your sunglasses in.

381
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,228
Can you do
that with a crew neck?

382
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,063
Because I'd like
to see you tr--

383
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,940
Whoa.

384
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,694
[groaning]

385
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,278
Bagel.

386
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,823
Thanks so much for running
this scene with me.

387
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,907
I have so many lines to learn.

388
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,327
Yeah, well, most of my lines
are, "True dat,"

389
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,412
but I guess it never hurts
to practice.

390
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,541
The citizens of Planet D
want their king back.

391
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,251
But I'm more concerned
with getting my self-esteem back

392
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,505
after being in the shadow
of powerful men for so long.

393
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,673
True dat.

394
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,007
Is it just me,
or is this movie

395
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,676
kind of flying off the rails?

396
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,678
Well, I don't want to overuse
my catchphrase here,

397
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,137
but true dat.

398
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,848
This is so typical.

399
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,266
I just wanted to do something
light and fun

400
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,937
to distract me from the deep
well of sadness that is my life.

401
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,773
You probably
wouldn't understand.

402
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,233
Oh, puh-lease.

403
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,109
I'm so deep down
a well of sadness

404
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,238
that Baby Jessica
is like, "Damn."

405
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,948
Shut up and kiss me,
you miserable goof.

406
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,325
What?

407
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,370
Oh. Okay. Mwah.

408
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,080
Pop this in a drawer.

409
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,041
Huh?

410
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,794
- [glass shatters]
- This is good, baby.

411
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,337
Oh, this is amazing.

412
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,381
Naomi, I haven't felt
like this since--

413
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,549
No, no, shh, shh, shh!

414
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,760
Call me Diane.

415
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,346
Okay, got my bagel.

416
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,931
Now back to work.

417
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,808
Hey, guys.

418
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,309
Hey, guys!

419
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,979
Wow, wow.

420
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,858
So you guys
really hit it off, huh?

421
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,359
That's awesome.

422
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,861
Want to do some hand stuff
in the bathroom

423
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,945
before we go down to set?

424
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,321
You read my mind.

425
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,909
Now, kiss me some sour cream.

426
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,827
Hey, so I finished the book

427
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,662
and sent the draft
to the publishers.

428
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:55,747
What?
My book is ready?

429
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,831
Let me read it.
Can I read it?

430
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,875
Call Pinky.

431
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,835
He'll probably send you a copy
as soon as he's done with it.

432
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,462
All right!
You hang tight, baby.

433
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,088
I got an instant classic
to read.

434
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,172
Keep the engine running, though,

435
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,716
because if I know me,
this book is gonna give me

436
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,008
a pretty big erection.

437
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,844
Okay, enjoy!
Keep an open mind.

438
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,554
You'll love it.
It's a work in progress.

439
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,390
[telephone rings]

440
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,558
Hello.
Penguin Publishing.

441
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,143
Unless this is that loan shark,

442
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,978
in which case,
Johnny's House of Noodles.

443
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,688
May I interest you
in our bento lunch box?

444
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,273
Pinky, it's me.

445
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,608
Let me read the book.
Give me, give me, give me.

446
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,485
Okay, okay, now,
I should warn you,

447
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,071
it's not quite what we expected,
but it is good.

448
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,824
I'm telling you,
this could really sell.

449
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,450
I might actually get
to see my kids again.

450
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,534
Great.
Send it over.

451
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,994
I'll read it right now.

452
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,746
All right, I sent it,
but just remember--

453
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,332
To set my expectations
sky-high?

454
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,792
- Way ahead of you.
- [cell phone beeps]

455
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,294
All right, book,
let's see what you got.

456
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,213
BoJack, this is you.

457
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,841
<i>One Trick Pony?</i>

458
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,676
<i>"The first time</i>
<i>I met BoJack Horseman,</i>

472
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,250
What the shit was that?

473
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,962
What the shit is this?

474
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,047
It's a phone.
Well, a tiny computer, really.

475
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,590
I mean, amazing
what technology can--

476
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,217
You were supposed
to ghostwrite my memoir,

477
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,927
but instead you wrote
a story about how you spent

478
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,513
six months with me and saw
what a big, dumb loser I am.

479
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,765
Well, I realized
that the best way

480
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,018
to fully capture you,
warts and all--

481
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,936
This isn't warts and all.
It's just warts.

482
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,979
Where's the all?

483
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,647
I come off like a total asshole.

484
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,525
You come off
as complex and deeply troubled

485
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,943
but ultimately sympathetic.

486
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,820
You might be too close
to see that.

487
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,364
There's an entire chapter
about me eating apple fritters.

488
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,033
You did go through
that fritter phase.

489
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,450
Is this book how you see me?

490
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,911
That day we ran errands
together,

491
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,245
I thought that we had
a really good time,

492
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,830
but you just wrote
about how I cried

493
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,582
because the dry cleaner
took my head shot down.

494
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,083
You were very emotional.

495
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,919
They didn't even
replace me with anyone.

496
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,087
Now it's just a faded spot
where my face used to be.

497
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,089
This will actually do wonders
for your career.

498
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,507
Trust me.

499
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,467
I mean, you're just
a dumb actor

500
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,094
who doesn't know anything
about books, right?

501
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,013
- [laughs]
- What?

502
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,305
Remember?
From before?

503
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,766
Oh, I don't think you
understand

504
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:20,850
what's happening here.

505
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,227
This is not a casual
conversation between friends.

506
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,855
This is your boss
telling his employee

507
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,398
that she did a bad job.

508
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,442
- Try again.
- What?

509
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,402
Start over, but do it right
this time.

510
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,905
Nobody is ever gonna see this.

511
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,241
- Ugh!
- [cell phone dialing]

512
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,953
- [cell phone vibrating]
- Diane?

513
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,038
Hey, Wayne,
you still work for <i>BuzzFeed</i>?

514
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,330
Um, yes.

515
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,832
'Cause I got something
that's gonna get you

516
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,544
a shit-ton of hearts or digs
or smileys

517
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,756
or whatever the hell you measure
your journalism with.

518
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,424
Curses!

519
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,343
My evil plan has been defeated,
but I'll be back.

520
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,762
You haven't heard the last

521
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,057
of Evil Emperor
BoJackitron Horsemaniac.

522
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,182
Oh, no!

523
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,768
You shot a laser at me!

524
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,686
Oh, no!
I'm dying.

525
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,106
Oh, no, I'm dead.

526
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,066
And so now
that we've escaped

527
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,485
the evil clutches
of the emperor,

528
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,237
I'm free to assume
my natural form,

529
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,824
an all-knowing floating orb
of light?

530
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:18,950
True dat.

531
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,576
- Cut, cut.
- [buzzer sounds]

532
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,995
Come on, guys,
this is ridiculous.

533
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,913
Is this even a movie anymore?

534
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,916
Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.

535
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,543
Yeah, maybe it's
an immersive smartphone app

536
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:34,381
or a 21st-century approach
to 360-degree media envelopment.

537
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:38,344
Yeah, or maybe it's just,
like, a feeling, you know?

538
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,138
- We've got work to do.
- Yeah, yeah.

539
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,556
- Oh, my God, this is so good.
- Oh, this is gonna be awesome.

540
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,850
Yes!
Go, Todd.

541
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,267
Hello?

542
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,644
Are you just gonna leave me
like this?

543
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,728
Anyone?

544
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,772
Ah!

545
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,231
Oh, good.
You're here.

546
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,692
Oh, hi, BoJack.

547
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,318
This whole day's
been a shit show.

548
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,154
The book turned out
to be a total hatchet job.

549
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,655
The movie's a disaster.

550
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,158
But thank God I have one
good thing in my life,

551
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,283
and that's you.

552
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,743
BoJack, I--

553
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,787
Please let me say this
before I lose my nerve.

554
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,914
I spent 50 years roaming
the countryside

555
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,542
as a wild stallion,
but I am tired of the rodeo,

556
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,127
and I'm finally ready
to saddle up.

557
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,211
BoJack--

558
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,754
I guess what I'm trying
to say is,

559
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,049
this mustang wants to rest
his head in the comforts

560
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,508
of your spacious barn.

561
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,801
Uh, what?

562
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,427
I'm in love with you, Naomi.

563
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,762
BoJack, they fired me

564
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,431
and replaced me
with a ball on a stick.

565
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,516
I'm so sorry.

566
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,143
But look at the bright side.

567
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,353
Now you and I can just hang out
and talk about feelings.

568
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,023
No, but you're not getting it.
Boys never get it.

569
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,901
BoJack, I was in character
as Diane,

570
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:38,112
and as Diane,
we had a real connection.

571
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,740
But now that I'm off the movie,
I'm Naomi again,

572
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,368
and Naomi is not interested
in BoJack Horseman.

573
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,996
In fact,
she thinks he's kind of gross.

574
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,415
So I didn't fall in love
with Naomi Watts?

575
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,499
No.

576
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,085
You fell in love with Diane.

577
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,587
Naomi what?

578
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,296
Good-bye, BoJack.

579
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,381
Ugh.

580
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,884
See?
Nothing.

581
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,805
What's going on?
Why are they packing up?

582
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,974
Oh, glad you're here.
This is exciting.

583
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,893
Since we last talked,
this film has gone through

584
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,895
- so many permutations.
- So many.

585
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,605
First, we reimagined
the whole film

586
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,191
as an interactive
social-media experience.

587
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,776
Those are the dumbest words
I've ever heard.

588
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:17,860
I know.

589
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,779
So we realized it was actually

590
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,530
more of a floating
art installation,

591
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,199
but that
didn't feel right either.

592
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,825
We thought,
is it a high-end perfume?

593
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,744
A series of interrelated
fortune cookies?

594
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,747
A hat that if you turn it
upside down, it's a boat?

595
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,250
- No, it's none of those things.
- Exactly.

596
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,376
That's why we finally
settled on this.

597
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,461
Voilà!

598
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,963
What am I looking at?

599
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,216
[Todd] It is a bimonthly curated
box of snacks.

600
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,425
I don't know what that means.

601
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,010
I know.
It's confusing.

602
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,762
Not the bimonthly
that means twice a month,

603
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,265
the bimonthly that
means every other month,

604
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,143
and each time
it's a different box of snacks.

605
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,436
This is the future of cinema.

606
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,523
You guys, finally,
my story has been told.

607
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,401
Okay, that's a wrap, everyone.
[claps hands]

608
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,404
Thanks for making
this box of snacks a reality.

609
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,489
Let's go home.

610
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,202
What the hell happened
to the movie?

611
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:11,747
Shit, there were snacks here
the whole time?

612
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,873
Not bad.

613
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,500
- Whoa!
- Look, I get it.

614
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,169
You destroyed my big chance
at a comeback

615
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,087
as revenge for what I did
to your rock opera.

616
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:21,757
Revenge? Oh, that would have
been such a good idea.

617
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,050
Damn it, Todd!

618
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,011
Look, I figured out
what you did,

619
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,721
but I've been trying to put it
behind me and do my job.

620
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,683
So cutting my part down
was not about revenge?

621
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:31,809
No.

622
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,686
And making BoJack the villain
of your movie

623
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,354
was not a coded statement
of your feelings about me?

624
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,439
No.

625
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,233
Oh, okay, great.

626
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,527
Well, I'm-- I'm glad
we buried the hatchet

627
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,611
and everything's cool.

628
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:46,282
Uh, actually, you know,
everything is not cool.

629
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,826
You ruined my rock opera
by using character actress

630
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,368
Margo Martindale to trick me

631
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,079
into playing
an addictive video game.

632
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,998
And saying it all together
like that,

633
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,666
it all sounds
kind of ludicrous.

634
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,502
But still, it was something
I cared about,

635
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,005
and what you did
really hurt me.

636
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,257
Oh.
Well, this feels shitty.

637
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,926
You sure you don't want to just
get some revenge real quick--

638
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,012
thump me once in the stones
and then we'll be even?

639
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,387
I got to go.

640
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:13,559
I've got some artisanal popcorns
to gauge the mouthfeel of.

641
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,311
<i>- </i>Hey, BoJack.
- Yeah?

642
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,645
You want an apple fritter?

643
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,314
Uh, sure.

644
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,982
- Yeah, I bet you would.
- [laughter]

645
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,567
I bet you'd like
an apple fritter.

646
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,569
Yeah, an apple fritter
would be great.

647
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,030
Why? What-- What--
What's happening here?

648
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,615
"Five Shocking Facts
From New BoJack Book"?

649
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,159
No.
No!

650
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,870
Um, everyone,
please turn off your Internet.

651
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,330
It has gone bad.

652
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:37,083
I repeat,
the Internet has gone foul.

653
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,085
- What a loser.
- I'm glad I'm not that guy.

654
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,669
Give me your phones.
I'm a celebrity.

655
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:41,962
You have to listen to me.

656
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,756
Look at his deep well
of sadness.

657
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,716
It's hilarious.

658
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,052
Don't look at me.
I'm well-adjusted.

659
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,346
- You all want my life.
- [laughter]

660
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,889
Uh, what the hell?

661
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,599
I know, I know.
But if you just listen for--

662
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,184
You posted your dumb little
book on the Internet.

663
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,103
No, I just leaked
the first couple chapters,

664
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,812
and people are already talking
about it.

665
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,982
This is wildly unprofessional.
Who do you think you are?

666
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,943
I know you're mad,
and you have every right to be,

667
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,569
but you got to read
some of these comments.

668
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,029
People love you.

669
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,281
And they're gonna love you
even more

670
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,241
when they read the rest
of my book.

671
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,034
- Your book?
- Our book.

672
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,786
Nobody is gonna read
that book.

673
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,037
How do you still not get that?

674
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,206
It is never going
to be published.

675
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,583
BoJack, I stand by my work.

676
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,419
This is a really good book.

677
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,755
And if you just give it time,
you'll see.

678
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,548
[sighs]

679
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,925
Maybe you're right.

680
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,218
Really?

681
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,053
No.
