39

<i>Horsin' Around </i>was not a sucky show.

40
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,853
- Yeah, but it was.
- It lasted nine seasons.

41
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,814
Its whole purpose
was for people to watch it

42
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,357
so the network could sell ad time,

43
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,609
so the show could make more money
than it cost to produce.

44
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,736
It did that well. It was a good show.

45
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,614
- Yes, but it sucked.
- It didn't suck!

46

It could not have gone better.

169
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,938
Oh, yeah. Somebody did their research

184
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,392

185
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,191
Oh, no.

Hello? Are you still there?

187
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,905
- They may have hung up.
- I have some good news for once.

188
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,658
I just got promoted
to head of programming.

189
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,911
I'm no longer a passenger
on the burning wreckage of an industry

190
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,163
that is broadcast television.

- What happened to Wanda?

192
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,626
You didn't hear? She got poached.

193
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,753
- Oh, God!
- By another company.

194
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,754
Oh, good.

195
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,506
- They shot her.
- Oh, God!

196
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,675
Straight to the top
of the corporate ladder!

197
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,053
- Oh, good.
- She had to move to Detroit.

198
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,473
- Oh, God!
- Which I hear is due for a resurgence.

199
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,600
Can we get to the goddamn point, please?

200
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,019
Anyway, the network
is finally breaking even,

201
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,022
thanks to the runaway success
of <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

202
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,483
<i>What Do They Know?</i>
<i>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out!</i>

203
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,736

- So as long as you two stick around...
- I'm taking the show off the air.

Wait, what? Why?!

208
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,538
I told the story I wanted to tell.

209
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,874
To prolong it for commercial reasons
would be crass and inorganic.

210
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,792
Uh...

211
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,671
At long last the public knows
what Hollywoo stars and celebrities know

212
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,047
- and what they don't know.
- [moaning]

- [whimpers]

- Well, we found out.
- This is a nightmare.

215
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,137
Why does everything I love fall apart
as soon as I touch it?

216
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,347
Oh, my ex-wife was right about me.

217
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,143
I <i>am </i>no Christopher
from the Tesla dealership.

218
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,525
Is this as good as it gets?

219
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:14,780
Or are we living in the ghost town
where once my career did blossom?

220
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,159
Who will speak my name
when I am gone?

221
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:22,747
Who will sing lamentations
for he who once talked soup?

222
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,667
- [groans]
- What legacy of ruin am I left with?

223
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,630
What rewards have I reaped
for the damage done?

224
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,924
I do not miss the spotlight's glare,

225
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:38,095
but I do... a little, miss sunshine.

226
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,847

228
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,686
But before you fold the omelette,

229
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,607
I'd like the chef to hold the pan up
and whisper his or her dreams into it.

230
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,069
Whisper dreams into omelette.

231
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,571
Just coffee.
Don't need to talk to it at all. Thanks.

232
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,240
You look different. Older. A lot older.

233
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,202
I'm not saying you look bad,
just much, much, much older.

234
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,244
Thank you, Jill.

235
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,580
You haven't heard from Cuddlywhiskers
recently, have you?

236
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,458
Cuddlywhiskers? I haven't talked
to him since the show was canceled.

237
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,793
I worry about him.

238
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,295
About six months back, he disappeared,

239
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,588
stopped returning my calls.

240
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:16,592
I'm sure he's fine.
I mean, who returns calls?

241
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,928
Promise me you'll check on him
when you get back to L.A.

242
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,680
Maybe swing by his house?
I think you owe him that much.

243
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,641
Fine. Listen, about the play...

244
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,310
<i>The Tragedy of Greg KingLear,</i>
a theatrical immersion by Jill Pill?

245
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,354
- Right.
- That's dead. Over.

246
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,272
A thing that happened
that happens no longer,

247
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,690
- like a whimper in the wind.
- Okay.

248
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:36,779
Theater is by its very nature ephemeral.
We shout into the void, "Hey, you!"

249
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,782
And the void says,
"Stop shouting at me, please!"

250
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,536
And we grab the void and we spit
in its face, "Sir, I will not."

251
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,413
Boy, did New York do a number on you.

252
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,582
Let me tell you about my next piece.
It starts with you,

253
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,002
BoJack Horseman,
completely naked and covered in milk.

254
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,046
- I'll stop you there.
- It's a symbol for rebirth.

255
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,006
I'm not interested in being rebirthed.

256
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,467
I'm still recovering
from being birthed the first time.

257
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,011
Jill, I'm not the guy who does things
that are challenging,

258
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,097
or edgy, or covered in milk.

259
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,767
I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.
I'm thinking about my legacy now.

260
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,146
I want to do things that connect
with people, things that last.

261
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,273
That's the whole point, nothing lasts.

262
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,275
No, I know, but see, years after I die,

263
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,694
people will still be able
to see me in <i>Secretariat.</i>

264
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,446
- And then what?
- And then...

265
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,199
I'll be remembered.
If I win an Oscar, I'll be remembered.

266
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,244
- And then what?
- Then my life will have meaning.

267
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,413
- I don't know!
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,498
You know what the real tragedy
of <i>Greg KingLear </i>is?

269
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,167
Two hours long without an intermission?

270
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,626
It's that he's a marionette.

271
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,088
And he doesn't even know someone else
is pulling his strings.

272
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,008
Mmm, I don't think the chef
whispered his dreams into this.

273
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,468
This does not taste like dreams.

274
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,557
You told me I would be getting
more attention at a smaller agency,

275
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,601
but if anything, I'm getting less.

276
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,145
Is this the best time to be on your phone?

277
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,814
I'm sorry.
Let me just send this one email...

278
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,192
What? Why isn't it sending? Judah!

279
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,402
I'm taking my business

What? No!

00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,537
I need an agency

Uh...

285
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:13,876
That was a reference to my work,
with which you are clearly not familiar.

Oh, I don't know why
I thought I could do this.

I believe I can take on
more responsibility around here.

00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,478
- On a provisional basis, of course.
- Okay.

293
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,731
But we're a small agency
and we need to think like one.

294
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,358
Instead of spreading ourselves thinner,

295
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,319
we should focus on better gigs
for the clients we already have.

296

00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,730
Oh, it's <i>Cat's in the Cradle</i>,
but don't listen to it now!

326
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,231
I'm gonna go listen to it.

327
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,525
No! The lyrics are too relevant.
Don't do it.

328
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,944
- No!

329

[both laughing]

330
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,619
So, what's next for BoJack?

331
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,456
What do you mean, "What's next?"
Why does everything have to have a next?

332
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:19,543
I just mean, after <i>Secretariat's</i> all over,
what are you going to do next?

333
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,923
We were told this feature would be
pegged to the release of <i>Secretariat.</i>

334
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,426
It is, but we also want to get to know
the real BoJack.

335
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,094
- Do we?
- If you want the real BoJack,

336
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,679
there's a book written about that.

337
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,891
But that was BoJack
before the book came out.

338
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,476
Who's BoJack now?

339
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,811
Who's BoJack now? BoJack is just...

340
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,230
He's a guy who could use a drink,
that's who!

341
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,440
Should we order alcohol?

342
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,276
Heather, could we have
a moment of privacy, please?

343
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,363
Sure. I'll just plug my ears
and sing an old sea shanty.

344
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,951

Sweetheart, I don't think
we need to be drinking tonight.

346
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,122
Trust me, you do not want me
to do this sober.

347
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,292
You don't need to micromanage
everything, okay? I'm not your puppet.

348
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,004
All right.
You clearly have everything under control.

353
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,850
- Did mama bear finally leave?
- She's a human, but yes.

354
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,644
Well, when the cat's away...

355
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,729
Again, a human.
I like where you're going with this.

356
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,940
I gotta tell you,
I really loved the movie.

357
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,984
You're definitely going to win an Oscar.

358
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,070
That "You Are Secretariat" scene?
Oh, it made me wet.

359
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,321
It made you wet?!

360
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,532
Yeah. "Wet" is manatee slang.

361
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,909
It refers to a feeling
of comfort and warmth,

362
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,704
because a manatee's
natural habitat is water.

363
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,038
Oh, okay.

364
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,040
- It also made me really horny.
- Uh...

365
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,417
That's narwhal slang.

366
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,168
You know, because they have horns.

The first thing you notice about BoJack
is he's got a nice buzz going.

377
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,329
Oh, one final question.
Are you more man than horse?

378
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,081
Or are you more horse than man?

379
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,374
What the hell does that mean?

Okay! A manatee and a horse
making out with each other.

384
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,968
Just like in nature.

385
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,847
In the old days sailors thought
manatees were mermaids.

386
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,184
Remember that episode of <i>Horsin' Around</i>
where Sabrina wanted to be a mermaid?

387
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,019
I don't want to think about that show.

388
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,854
I didn't come back to your hotel room

389
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,983
because you're a goofy dad who once got
his dick stuck in a vacuum cleaner.

390
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,611
I'm pretty sure
that never happened on the show.

391
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,322
If I'm going to sacrifice
my journalistic integrity,

392
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,617
it's because I'm having sex
with a movie star.

393
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,534
And they're off!

- [Heather] I'm a mermaid, baby.

- Gonna climb up onto your boat.
- [BoJack] What?

398
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,467
- [Heather] What happened?
- Sorry, I just... Give me a minute.

No, no, just...

that thing about the boat?

I don't know, I was being sexy.
You okay?

There's nothing to talk about.
It was a misunderstanding, that's all.

She just walked in
at the worst possible...

It-- It wasn't my fault, uh, right?

I don't know what you're talking about.

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,127
On the boat, there was a girl.

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,129
- What?
- In New Mexico.

412
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,506
And she trusted me.

413
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,552
I keep asking myself
if her mother didn't walk in,

414
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,886
would I have done it?

415
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,556
And part of me is sure
that I-- I couldn't.

416
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,101
But another part knows that's a lie.

How do you make something right

you have to keep moving forward?

No, it's 7:00. I'm in New York.
I'm calling from the future.

What do you want?

443
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,923
Let's say, hypothetically,
you had some information about me.

444
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,382
You were gonna write about it,

a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Too bad Todd's not here.

473
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,076
He's always the best
at coming up with ideas

474
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,245
that at first might seem terrible...

475
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,580
Right.

476
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,041
If he was here,
he'd probably say something like,

477
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,836
"Hey, you know what's cool?
Spaghetti strainers!"

478
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,129
Go on.

479
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,382
And you'd say, "I feel like
I've seen that somewhere before."

480
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,551
Hah! That is so me!

481
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,220
And then he'd say, "What if I told you

482
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,640
that this spaghetti strainer
is also a hat?"

483
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,227
A spaghetti strainer that's also a hat?

484
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,021
That is a brilliant idea!

485
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,148
That's a terrible idea.
That's my point!

486
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,774
Put that in the maybe pile.

487
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,818
Right now, we need to focus
on TV shows.

488
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,570
I'm sure Todd would suggest,

<i>That's Also A Hat: The TV Show.</i>

00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,868
That's it! Todd, you've done it again.

491
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,578
No! Nobody's done anything.

492
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,040
Oxnard, I want you to buy out
the entire spaghetti strainer warehouse.

493
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,292
I mean, every spaghetti strainer they got.

494
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,211
I'm putting all my money
in spaghetti strainers for this show.

495
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,423
- How is this a show?
- Don't ask me. It's your idea.

496
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,382
[sighs]

497
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,095
- [vehicle stopping]
- [door opens, closes]

498
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,557
I took care of our problem.

499
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,142
What did you do?

500
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,771
You don't need to know anything else.
It's been taken care of.

501
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,230
Ana...

502
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,775
There-- There was a moment
back at the hotel where...

503
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,695
I really thought I blew it,
I was scared it was all over, and--

504
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,573
And then after, I was relieved.

505
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,493
I don't know if I should win an Oscar.

506
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,412
- I don't know if I want to.
- Stop punishing yourself.

507
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,164
I was in New Mexico.

508
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:58,126
None of that matters.
All that matters now is the story.

509
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,212
We get to decide what our story is.

510
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,298
Nobody else gets to tell you
what your story is.

511
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,342
- What is my story?
- I'll tell you.

512
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:09,262
This has been your dream for the last
30 years. You made it happen.

513
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:13,517
An Oscar won't make you happy forever,
it won't solve all your problems.

514
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,312
You win that Oscar,
the next day you go back to being you.

515
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,565
But that night is a really good night.

516
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:25,403
I think you deserve a really good night,
and I know how to get you there.

517
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,364
Do you want that?

518
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,950
Yes, I do.

519
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,328
Go introduce your movie. Tell your story.

520
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,831
Tomorrow we fly to Chicago.

521
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,503
<i>Being Secretariat</i>
<i>isn't just about running fast.</i>

522
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,713
<i>Secretariat's a state of mind.</i>

523
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:47,676
<i>It's about doing the right thing,</i>
<i>standing up for yourself.</i>

524
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,972
<i>Why, I look around and I see</i>
<i>a whole room full of Secretariats.</i>

525
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,307
<i>You are Secretariat.</i>

526
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,518
<i>And you are Secretariat.</i>

527
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,312
<i>And you... are Secretariat.</i>

528
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:07,195
BoJack, it's such a beautiful movie
and I think such a textured performance.

529
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,072
When you were on <i>Horsin' Around</i>,

530
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,075
could you ever have imagined
that you'd give a performance like this?

531
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,245
- Yes. Actually, I imagined it a lot.
- [laughter]

532
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,248
I always knew I was more
than just a dumb TV actor.

533
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,877
Even if other people
didn't always know that.

534
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,629
- [laughter]
- Seriously, though...

535
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,215
that TV show...

536
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,092
it wasn't me.

537
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,636
This movie is me.

538
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,056
And I can't tell you how great it feels
to finally be doing

539
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,684
the kind of work that I can be proud of.

540
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,145
