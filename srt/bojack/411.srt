00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,056
Slow down, Henrietta.
A lady mustn't rush. It's unbecoming.

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,434
I am not Henrietta! I'm your son!

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,853
My son is a ball of gas.

4
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:23,606
Yes! Your son, BoJack. I'm him.
I'm the ball of gas!

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,025
But you're also a star.

6
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,527
Wait. Mom, do you remember--

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,196
Shh! Henrietta, I am talking to the sun.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,075
Sun, you're a ball of gas,
but you're also a star.

9
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,745
-We call you... "Sun."
-Ugh!

10
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,414
Where are you taking me?
Are we going to the lake house?

11
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,834
No, we're going
to a glorious magical place

12
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,253
where they'll lock you
in a room by yourself

13
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,255
so you can't hurt anyone ever again.

14
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,049
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Why are you driving so slowly?

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,676
-Hurry up!
-Wait. You just said--

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,638
Time's arrow neither stands still
nor reverses, after all.

17
00:00:55,722 --> 00:01:00,143
It merely marches forward.
Isn't that right, Henrietta?

18
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,437
Yes, Mrs. Horseman. That's right.

00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,484
Well, here we are.

-Here?
-Yes.

{\an8}Even your lungs expostulate

your ample corpulence.

I don't care if you're scared

48
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,577
you have to go to school.

{\an8}Now stop making books your friends.

{\an8}and you are continually failing!

59
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,191
How could you not have known
she has scarlet fever?

60
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,860
Say something, damn it!
What has become of you?

61
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,154
I swear if I'd known
this is how you'd behave

62
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,032
once we severed the connections
to your prefrontal cortex,

63
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,533
I'd hardly have bothered.

64
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,245
-Father?
-[gasps] Yes, darling?

00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,704
Am I to die?

Well, eventually yes,
but this illness is but a hiccup

67
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,125
in what will be a long and happy life,

68
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,835
-I promise.
-You promise?

69
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,837
In fact, some good
may yet come of this.

70
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,173
Doctor says your throat
is nearly swollen shut.

71
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,217
So perhaps you'll finally lose
some of that weight

72
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,551
that's given you such troubles.

73
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,637
-Won't that be nice?
-Yes, Father.

74
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,643
-Ow!
-Suck in, Miss Sugarman, please.

75
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,895
{\an8}Polly, be a darling and fetch me

00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,315
{\an8}Yes, Señorita Sugarman.

78
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,609
{\an8}Beatrice, you're looking well,
which is just fine,

79
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,153
{\an8}because your debutante party
is vitally important.

80
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,823
Will it end poverty, war and injustice,

81
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,492
or bring back civil rights
activist Medgar Evers,

82
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,577
who was shot in Mississippi
this week?

83
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,998
Yes! Or rather, it will end you
worrying about that nonsense

84
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,582
because it will land you a husband.

85
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:57,255
{\an8}At least Evers' death means no one else
will be assassinated this year, 1963.

86
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:01,050
The FBI is on too high alert to allow
anything like that to happen again.

87
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,303
-Hmm?
-Yes... well...

88
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,013
Your chaperone,
Corbin Creamerman,

89
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,681
is a fine young man.

90
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,891
Oh, jeez.

91
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,228
-My lady. [chuckles] Here you go.
-Thanks.

92
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,568
So... uh, you look nice.

93
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,404
Thank you, Corbin.
That's the third time you've told me.

94
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,864
You needn't tell me again.

95
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,784
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.
I'm not always good at these things.

96
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,787
But sometimes I am.
I can be. I-- I really try to be.

97
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,498
I'm, well, I-- I'm not. I'm really not.
I don't know why.

98
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,460
Ah, that's all right. I'm not either.

99
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,378
[Joseph]
Corbin's father, Mort Creamerman,

100
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,673
is founder of Creamerman's
Creamy Cream-based Commodities.

101
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,177
Think of all the free iced cream
you could, uh, serve to other people.

102
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,138
Father, do you aim to marry me off
to Corbin Creamerman

103
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,265
merely because it would be good
for business?

104
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,309
Well, I suppose I do have a few ideas

105
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,604
of how a Sugarman/Creamerman
alliance might be advantageous.

106
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,897
-Uh-huh.
-For example,

107
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,858
imagine a television advertisement
with a fun jingle.

108
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,277
<i>♪ Have your morning coffee or tea ♪</i>

109
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,029
<i>♪ With Sugarman and Creamerman ♪</i>

110
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,156
<i>♪ But save some for... these fellas ♪</i>

111
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,825
And then it's Mort and me,
and we're holding up our products

112
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,579
with big smiles from across
a very ordinary looking kitchen table.

113
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,874
Father, common Americans
don't want you on their TV sets.

114
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,044
You're a reminder of the disparity
of wealth in this country.

115
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,463
Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.

116
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,091
You know, I sent you to Barnard
to get your MRS

117
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,301
from a fine upstanding Columbia man,

118
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,220
but instead of a bachelor
you returned home

119
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,473
with a bachelor's degree
and a mouth full of sass.

120
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,058
What a waste!

121
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,976
[sighs]

122
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,354
-[Corbin] <i>You look nice.</i>
-Thank you.

123
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:41,818
Oh, my... Beatrice Sugarman?
Doth my eye belie me?

124
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,530
Oh, Clemelia Bloodsworth.
Why are you here?

125
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,991
I must say,
it's tremendous you're finally debuting.

126
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,619
Better late than never, hmm?
[chuckles]

127
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,540
Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father,
who has very old-fashioned ideas

128
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,583
about how a woman is to live her life.

129
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,670
Poor Corbin here is saddled
with chaperoning me.

130
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,921
Oh, I don't feel saddled.

131
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,549
In truth,
I find these parties to be garish,

132
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,884
self-serving wastes of money.

133
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,471
Oh, and I'm sure yours
was particularly horrendous, Clemelia.

134
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,722
[spits and coughs]

135
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,101
Oh, my! How repugnant!

136
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,856
Uh... scotch on the rocks.

137
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,109
-Do I know you?
-[chuckles]

138
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,362
Nope, just crashing some dumb
debutante's party. [chuckles]

139
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:30,867
Oh, do you mean for "dumb"
to describe the party or the debutante?

140
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,494
Because I might agree with you,
or I might be offended.

141
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,496
You're the dumb debutante, aren't you?

142
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,207
Beatrice Sugarman.
Welcome to my dumb party.

143
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,501
Butterscotch Horseman.
Charmed, I'm sure.

144
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,794
You crash a lot of these?

145
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,880
I'll take my free alcohol
where I can get it.

146
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,006
Saving for California.

147
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,257
What's in California?

148
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,676
Ginsberg, Cassady, Squirrelinghetti.

149
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,596
This is where you ask me
if those are towns, and I smirk at you.

150
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,890
I am familiar with the Beats,
thank you.

151
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,225
I like Ginsberg all right,
but if you ask me,

152
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,269
that Squirrelinghetti is nuts.

153
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,563
-What's your interest in them?
-What's my interest?

154
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,565
They're the greatest minds
of our generation.

155
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,194
I'm heading west to join them,
because I'm one of the greatest minds too.

156
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,778
-I see.
-You will see.

157
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,655
I'm writing the next
Great American Novel.

158
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,491
Oh, what's it about?

159
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,326
It's about truth! It's about war!

160
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,787
It's about the twilighting frontier
of the lives that were promised us.

161
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,457
But what is it about?
Who are the characters?

162
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,167
I never claimed to have
the whole thing

163
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,460
sorted out just yet, did I?

164
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,753
Sounds like a best seller.

165
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,797
You're sarcastic, which is an ugly thing
for a woman to be.

166
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,592
I don't know how you expect
to nab a husband at a party like this

167
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,843
with a personality like that.

168
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,764
Oh, congratulations. You and my father
express the same concerns.

169
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,349
[chuckles] If I were your old man,

170
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,226
I'd be anxious
to get you married off, too.

171
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,436
I bet your thank-you letters
are perfunctory,

172
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,105
your flower arrangements
are uninspired,

173
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,107
and your curtsy is an embarrassment.

174
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,317
-[chuckles]
-[laughs]

175
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,903
Looks like you pegged me
as well as I pegged you.

176
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,112
[clicks tongue]

177
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,240
What must your mother think of you?

178
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,701
Oh, she doesn't think much...
about anything, anymore.

179
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,453
Oh. I'm sorry, did... did she pass?

180
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,581
-No, not exactly.
-Mine did.

181
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,291
I'm very sorry to hear that.

182
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,544
I was little. I don't remember, really.

183
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,422
But she had a diamond just like yours.
I saw it in a picture once.

184
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,590
Oh...

185
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,551
-[BoJack] Yes, this is my mother.
-What?

186
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,677
I'd like to leave her here.

187
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,222
Can I pay for the next five years now
so I don't have to think about her again?

188
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,890
-Wha-- Oh.
-[Corbin] Oh, jeez, I--

189
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,352
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we have to do the thing now,

190
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,521
where we do the... things.

191
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,773
Oh-- oh, right. Um...

192
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,360
-Please excuse me.
-Of course, it sounds very important.

193
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,197
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Sugarman
present their daughter,

194
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,783
Miss Beatrice Elizabeth Sugarman.

195
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,911
Chaperoned by Mr. Corbin C. Creamerman.

196
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,081
Look at her go, folks.

197
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,125
Clearing every hurdle.

198
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,751
Look at that form.

199
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,712
What precise movements.

200
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,630
-[Beatrice] Five, six...
-[man] Beautiful trot.

201
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,215
[softly] Truly outstanding.

202
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,217
A lovely lady indeed.

203
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,803
-Ta-da!
-[applause]

204
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,055
[clears throat]
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

205
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,140
Oh...

206
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,852
Excuse me.

207
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,980
Don't you know it's rude to leave
without saying goodbye to the hostess?

208
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,231
Why don't you come with me?

209
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,318
It'll dispense with the need for goodbyes,
thus eliminating my transgression.

210
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,113
Oh! You want me to leave
my own party with you?

211
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,407
The low-life who wasn't even invited?

212
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,200
-[glass shatters]
-Yeah.

213
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,494
But I suppose Daddy
wouldn't like that, would he?

214
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,334
[both moaning]

215
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,127
Oh, Beatrice. [sputters]

216
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,092
-I have wonderful news.
-I'm reading.

217
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,596
Corbin Creamerman has come to call.
He'd like to take you for a Sunday stroll.

218
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,349
I am not interested
in Corbin Creamerman.

219
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,976
I don't give a damn
where your interests lie!

220
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,812
After the disappearing act you pulled
at your own party,

221
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,649
you're lucky I don't fill a jar
with jellied beans

222
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,735
and marry you off to the man
who can closest estimate the amount.

223
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,861
Heavens!

224
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,572
Corbin Creamerman is willing
to give you a second chance,

225
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,325
he is downstairs waiting,
and you <i>will</i> be civil to him.

226
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,409
[huffs]

227
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,204
And the way they make
non-dairy creamer

228
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,582
is by replacing the milk fat
with vegetable oil.

229
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,626
That's why it doesn't need refrigeration.

230
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,920
-Pretty nifty, huh?
-Is that so?

231
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,507
-Oh, jeez, I'm boring you.
-Not at all. I don't find <i>you</i> boring.

232
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,342
Only the things you choose
to talk about,

233
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,094
and the way in which
you talk about them.

234
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:22,139
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I...
I just get excited by food chemistry.

235
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,183
You know, you take something
you thought you knew,

236
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,227
and then discover
there's so much more to it

237
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,895
than you could have possibly imagined.

238
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,523
-It's like... magic.
-Oh?

239
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,441
My father is less enchanted.

240
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,444
He says it's just squeezing money
out of cow teats.

241
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,197
I suppose that's true,
but I got ideas too,

242
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,535
and I feel I never get to be anything
other than what he expects me to be.

243
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,495
You know what that's like?

244
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,871
I do.

245
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,206
You know, Corbin,

246
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,376
it occurs to me
that perhaps you and I aren't so--

247
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,044
-[retching]
-Oh, dear!

248
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,004
[screams]

249
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,014
[whistles]
Nice gams.

250
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,224
[whistles]
Nice gams.

251
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,768
Is that the only thing
you can think of to say?

252
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,396
[whistles]
Nice... gams.

253
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,606
-[sighs]
-Uh...

254
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,236
-Beatrice, what are you doing here?
-I had to look you up in the phone book.

255
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,240
The number you gave me
was to a pizza parlor in Brownsburg.

256
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,408
What? Are you sure?

257
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,160
Butterscotch, I'm pregnant.

258
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,120
-Wha--
-[whistles] Whoa, boy!

259
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,038
Come on, Bopper,
can you give us some privacy?

260
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,999
Sure thing, Butterscotch.
You take it easy.

261
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,876
[whistling]

262
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,752
Are you certain it's mine?

263
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,421
Well, whose else could it be?

264
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,673
What do you wanna do?
Maybe you have a cousin,

265
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,717
who has a... a friend,
who knows a doctor,

266
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,886
who can take care
of such inconveniences?

267
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,096
I'm-- I'm happy to do
the gentlemanly thing and...

268
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,639
and pay for the cab fare.

269
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,809
No. I can't.

270
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,103
Well, that doesn't leave us
with very many options.

271
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,354
I'm a ruined woman.

272
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,398
Don't be hysterical.
You're not ruined.

273
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,109
It's a verifiable fact
you look more beautiful than ever.

274
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,153
[scoffs] Oh, what do you know?

275
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,490
It was a pretty great night
we had together, huh?

276
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,949
It was.

277
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,663
Say, did you ever hear the story
of the couple who moved to California?

278
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,207
I can't say that I have.

279
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,833
Oh, it's a marvelous adventure.

280
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,460
You see, they hardly knew each other,

281
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,713
but they shared a certain sensitivity
and a taste for the unknown.

282
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,216
They were living in a one-horse town,
so they headed west,

283
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,135
towards a town that could
accommodate three horses.

284
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,804
Oh, yes, I think I <i>have</i> heard this story.

285
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,141
They got a small house
in San Francisco near the bookstore.

286
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,477
He got in good with Squirrelinghetti
and his scurry.

287
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,229
He wrote his Great American Novel...

288
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,314
While his wife took care of the baby.

289
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:39,276
His wife?
Oh, well, I didn't hear about that part.

290
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,445
Well, if she'd have him.

291
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,241
If a beautiful creature like herself
could ever love an oaf like him.

292
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,368
-I think she could.
-Yeah?

293
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,328
And isn't that how the story goes?

294
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,040

-Sleep.
-The baby's hungry.

301
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,061
I tried. He won't eat.
I don't know what he wants.

302
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,437
Well, can you figure it out?

303
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,190
If I don't sleep, how can I work
to support you and the child,

304
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,025
let alone have energy left over to write?

305
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,153
Maybe if anyone wanted to pay you
for anything you wrote,

306
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,531
we'd be able to afford
a nanny and a maid.

307
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,158
Well, if Squirrelinghetti
and his horde of commie, liberal,

308
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,327
Jew-loving rejects
knew what good writing was,

309
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,704
I'd be able to sell something.

310
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,373
Oh, so they're all wrong,
and you're right.

-[baby wails]
-[both groan]

312
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,045
Why won't you just take
that corner office job at Sugarman West

313
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,798
instead of breaking your back
all day at the cannery,

314
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,051
and then maybe you could afford me
some decent help around here?

315
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,929
You want me to work for your father,
and get paid for it,

316
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,472
like some sort of slave?

317
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,517
-That is the opposite of slavery.
-Is it?

318
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,937
Yes, it is!
You have no facility for language.

319
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,190
-[baby crying]
-Oh, will you at long last be quiet?

320
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,443
You wanted that baby.
Never forget that.

321
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,695
I need quiet!

322
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,238
[crying continues]

323
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,826

-Well, you're not.
-I'm not what?

326
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,752
Mommy's tired, BoJack.
Tell me a story.

00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,467
How was work, darling?

330
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,969
Ugh! Terrible.
Those fish do not like being canned.

331
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,722
Well, I burnt dinner, again.

332
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,933
But you can pick
at the charred remains

333
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,143
and delight me and your simple son

334
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,896

salt-of-the-earth co-workers

00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,483
like Eight-Finger Joe
and Sports-Team Steve...

336
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,026
-Oh, God.
-...before locking yourself

337
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,903
-in your study for the night...
-Know what?

338
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,448
...to chip away at your
never-ending goddamn novel.

339
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,741
I'll clean up the kitchen,

340
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,035
-and bathe our filthy child.
-If you could just--

341
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,244
And we'll just keep waltzing

342
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,788
-through this goddamn...
-Would you--

343
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,539
-...proletariat dream.
-No--

344
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,084
Maybe if the goddamn baby
wasn't crying all the time,

345
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,877
I could finish the goddamn novel.

346
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,462
I'm not a baby. I'm six.

347
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,422
Yes, wah, wah, ga, ga, goo, goo.

348
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,049
I'm forming sentences.

349
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,176
Oh, and I can't? Everyone's a critic.

350
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,552
I can see the headline now,

351
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,973
"Idiot Son Thinks Dad's Book is Great,
comma, Son is Idiot."

352
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,683
I didn't say your book is great.

353
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,934
I can't live like this!

354
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,144
I should have married
Corbin Creamerman.

355
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,646
Ha! Like he'd have you.

356
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,107
Oh, he would have.
And he would have been kind to me.

357
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,151
And he wouldn't have been
too much of a stubborn ass

358
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,862
to take a decent job
at my father's company!

359
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,157
Fine! I'll take the corner office,
with the company car, six-figure salary,

360
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,492
and four weeks paid vacation,

361
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,120
but if my novel becomes bad
because I no longer remember

362
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,415
what it's like to be working class,
we'll know of whom to be blamed.

363
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,876
-[door slams]
-Oh.

364
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,503
[classical music plays]

365
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,046
A little to the left. Good choice.

366
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,298
Just over... Careful with that.
That looks great.

367
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,134
Hello? You're always in the way.

368
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,385
-Why don't you go play?
-Okay.

369
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,594
-Go do something.
-Bye, Mom.

370
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,346
You are fired. Vacuum.
Thank you. Stat.

371
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,806
Goodbye. Thank you.

372
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,018
Henrietta, will you help me pack this?
I want to bring it to my son.

373
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,562
[laughs] Oh, that's so nice.
I love a good painting.

374
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,356
It's like TV without all the talking
and movement.

375
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,233
Jesus, what is that ghastly thing?

376
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,860
It belonged to Father.

377
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,987
I'm giving it to BoJack.

378
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,740
I never cared for the aesthetic arts.
Dulls the senses.

379
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,909
Art should be straightforward
and utilitarian, like my novel.

380
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,077
I can't wait to read it.

381
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,955
Books are fantastic.
The words tell stories.

382
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,916
-Henrietta, the painting.
-Right away, Mrs. Horseman.

383
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,710
I shouldn't have to ask you twice.

384
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,921
God gave you two ears
and me only the one mouth, after all.

385
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,760
-You could be nicer to her.
-No one's ever nice to me.

386
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,553
-Why should I be nice?
-Beatrice...

387
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,514
Just because the maid
bats her little eyes at you

388
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,350
and makes barely-qualifying- 
for-conversation conversation,

389
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,811
doesn't mean I'm so easily seduced.

390
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,563
I don't know
what you're insinuating. I--

391
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:48,484
Oh, I'm sure she makes you feel
like a big smart man,

392
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,110
never challenges you,

393
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,489
and thanks you for helping her
study for nursing school.

394
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,616
As a matter of fact,
she <i>is </i>studying for nursing.

395
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,327
I know. I can hear
your flirting through the wall,

396
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,829
when you're supposedly
"working on your novel."

397
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,748
I bet you think
she's falling in love with you.

398
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:07,002
You sensitive, misunderstood artist.
Ugh. Won't she be disappointed.

399
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,213
I don't know why you don't
just get a divorce already.

400
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,006
Oh, sure, that's the Hollywood way.

401
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,800
"We're out of mustard.
Let's get a divorce!"

402
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,426
"I'm a little sad. Divorce!"

403
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,844
"We've grown apart over the years

404
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,721
and our adult child
has moved out of the house

405
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,432
and there's no reason for us
to stay together. Divorce!"

406
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,102
That actually is a legitimate reason
to get a divorce.

407
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,438
Well, who else would have me now?
After what you did to my body?

408
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,066
-What I did?
-Anyway, do you want this painting?

409
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,528
It belonged to your grandfather,
a man who knew what marriage meant.

410
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,196
[muffled dialogue]

411
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,155
Sure.

412
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,032
I drove it all the way down here,
didn't I?

413
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,076
-You might as well take it.
-I said I'll take it.

414
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,121
Of course. Take.
That's all you ever do.

415
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,748
How long you sticking around for, Mom?

416
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,875
[sighs] Just pour me a drink
and I'll be on my way.

417
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,837
Yeah, let's get you good and liquored up
before you drive up the coast.

418
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,131
I got a date with Tonya Harding tonight.

419
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,299
She was the good one?
I always get them confused.

420
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,968
I heard your show was canceled.

421
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,262
Three years ago now.
You're really on the pulse, huh?

422
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,930
I never understood the appeal.

423
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,475
-It's just a bunch of silly stories.
-Some people like silly stories.

424
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,227
Lotta good they ever did me.

425
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,436
It's not Ibsen, but...

426
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,023
It would only depress me
to watch you bumble around like that.

427
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:14,111
All the sacrifices I made,
so that you could do this.

428
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,447
Thanks for the painting.

429
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,492
It'll be nice to have something that
always reminds me of this conversation.

430
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,331
[screams]

431
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,041
[screaming]

432
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,675
[clearing throat]

433
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,719
-Uh, Beatrice.
-What?

434
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,596
I, uh--
[clears throat]

435
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,640
-I gummed things up. [nervous chuckle]
-Oh?

436
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,267
It's Henrietta.

437
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,060
The girl went and got herself pregnant.

438
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,605
Oh, she got herself pregnant?

439
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,648
Can you talk to her?
Just woman to woman?

440
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,443
She wants to have the baby.
I-- I can't talk her out of it.

441
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,196
-What do you want me to say?
-I'm out of options, Bea.

442
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,865
You think I enjoy groveling
to my own wife, hat in hand?

443
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,451
If you weren't so neglectful
in your wifely duties...

444
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,120
-Don't you dare.
-I'm sorry. What do--

445
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,747
I don't know what to do. I...

446
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,083
Please. Just--
just fix this for me, please.

447
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:16,256
I know you hate me, Bea,
but please just think of the poor girl.

448
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,385
[exhales] Oh, God.

449
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,681
You're fired, of course.

450
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Horseman.

451
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,686
He was just so kind to me
and I felt so--

452
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,856
Let me guess, he said you reminded him
of his dead mother.

453
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,110
He said she had hair like mine.
He saw it in a picture once.

454
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,487
[sighs]

455
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,949
-Do you really want this child?
-I... I think so?

456
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,743
It's a baby horse.
[chuckles] A girl.

457
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,078
[sighs]

458
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:50,624
I need help. I'm studying to be a nurse,
and tuition keeps going up.

459
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,334
None of that is my fault.

460
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,171
If I can just finish school
and get a job, it'll be okay.

461
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,674
And who's going to care
for the baby while you work?

462
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,342
Because God knows he won't.

463
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,761
[sobbing]

464
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,055
Well, don't do that.
What does that solve?

465
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,016
I don't know what else to do,
Mrs. Horseman.

466
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,311
All right. We'll pay for your tuition.

467
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,730
-Really?
-Yes.

468
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,233
And you'll give the baby up
for adoption.

469
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,442
[gasps]

470
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,694
No.

471
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,029
You think you want this,
but you don't. Not like this.

472
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,155
Mrs. Horseman--

473
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,408
Don't throw away your dreams
for this child.

474
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,703
Don't let that man poison your life
the way he did mine.

475
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,414
You are going to finish your schooling
and become a nurse.

476
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,666
You'll meet a man, a good man,
and you'll have a family,

477
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,377
but please believe me,
you don't want this.

478
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,296
Oh...

479
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,381
Please, Henrietta,
you have to believe me.

480
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,342
Please, don't do what I did.

481
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,138
Mm-hmm.

482
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,390
[panting and grunting]

483
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,850
[screaming]

484
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,268
[panting]

485
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,644
[screaming]

486
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,607
My-- My baby!
Where's my baby?

487
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,276
[screaming]

488
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,777
[crying]

489
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,529
[screaming]

490
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,031
[crying]

491
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,701
[sighs]

492
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:11,204
-Oh, look at you.
-[chuckles]

493
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,915
-You did it, Henrietta.
-[panting]

494
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,334
Oh, my God.

495
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,295
[humming]

496
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,840
No, no, no. No, please.

497
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,508
Please don't. Stop.

498
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,136
Stop! Why are you doing this?

499
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,805
Beatrice, remember
what we say about crying?

500
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,640
-Mm-hmm.
-Crying is stupid.

501
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,101
But, Father,
tell them not to burn my things.

502
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,938
But, darling, they have to.
Your sickness has infected everything.

503
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,648
The hard part is over.

504
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,692
Wait. Wait. I wanna hold her.

505
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,569
-No. You'll get attached.
-Wait!

506
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,280
It all must be destroyed
for your own good.

507
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,449
-I need to hold her.
-This is for your own good.

508
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,577
-But not my baby.
-Yes. Especially your baby.

509
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,828
-Whoop!
-[gasps]

510
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,080
See, doesn't that feel better?

511
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,916
[Beatrice cries] No!

512
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,542
My baby!

513
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,211
Wait, please. I need to hold her.

514
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,462
-No, no.
-[crying]

515
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,048
Wait. No, please come back.
I need to hold her. Please.

516
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,674
[screams]

517
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,009
No!

518
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,886
Come on now, be strong.

519
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,430
You can't let your womanly emotions
consume you.

520
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,974
You don't wanna end up
like your mother now, do you?

521
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,684
[faint screaming in distance]

522
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,812
-[sobs] No.
-I promise.

523
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,816
One day this will
all be a pleasant memory.

524
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,951
Best of luck. See ya never.

525
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,330
-Who <i>is</i> that?
-[groans] Bye, Mom.

526
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,499
BoJack?

527
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,752
-Mom?
-BoJack? Is that you?

528
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,212
Yeah, it's me.

529
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:46,383
-Well, oh, what is this place?
-This is where you live now.

530
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,010
-No. Is it? No.
-Mom...

531
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,929
-Where are we, BoJack?
-I just told you.

532
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,139
I don't understand.

533
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,391
-Where... Where am I?
-You're...

534
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,644
in Michigan.

535
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,896
-Michigan?
-Yeah.

536
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,107
-At the lake house.
-I am?

537
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,818
It's a-- It's a warm summer night,

538
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:08,405
and the fireflies are dancing
in the sky.

539
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,449
And your whole family is here.

540
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,327
And they're telling you
that everything is gonna be all right.

541
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,998
Yes. That's right. What else?

542
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:22,711
The crickets are-- are chirping,
and the lake is still,

543
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,797
and the night is full of stars.

544
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,842
I can see it. It's so clear.

545
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,219
What are we doing here, BoJack?

546
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,596
We're sitting on the back porch,

547
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,557
and we're listening to your brother
play the piano,

548
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,392
and we're eating ice cream.

549
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,060
Vanilla ice cream.

550
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,188
Yes. That's right.

551
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,065
Oh, it's all so marvelous.

552
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,859
Can you taste the ice cream, Mom?

553
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,861
Oh, BoJack.

554
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,197
It's so...

555
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,866
