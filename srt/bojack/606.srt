-We have one request.

To not be treated like garbage.

Oh, is the news that you're marrying her,

and ruining my life?

54
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,206
Because I already heard that news
like 25 years ago, Jorge.

-I didn't come to your home to fight.
-Then joke's on you

-That was ten years ago.

59
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,803
Which, by the way,
is the only thing you ever gave me.

60
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,473
I gave you my name,
and you have clearly wasted it.

{\an8}Yes, Jorge.

Chavez! C for cerebral!
H for high-minded! A for analytical!

64
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,985
V for veracious! E for efficacious!

65

And Z for zealously practical.

Feels like a cheat on the Z.

Todd, your mother needs your help.

68
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,285
Well, then instead of sending her husband,

69
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,913
she should have asked me herself,
if it's so important to her.

70
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,707
-She's in a coma.
-A rudeness coma?

71

No, a regular coma.

Oh, my God! Why didn't you open with that?

73
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,756
Please. Your mother needs a kidney.

74
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,635
I put her on the donor waiting list,
but if you're a match...

75
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,763
Oh. I'm sorry.
Of course I would give Mom my kidney.

-Then there's no time to waste--
-"Would" give her my kidney.

If we respect them, how are we supposed

There's gotta be a better way!

Uh, maybe we could circumvent
giving the assistants what they want

96
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,154
by giving them what they think they want.

97
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,489
You know, like how we satiate TV creators

98
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,117
by giving them little vanity cards
at the end of episodes,

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,245
then sell the shows to streaming networks
that auto-skip the end credits

100
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,456
so no one even sees the vanity cards!

101

Yeah, yeah, that's good.
But what do assistants want?

102

iTunes gift cards? Amazon gift cards?

are all on strike, too.

00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,222
[organ plays]

168
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,973
Oh, no!

169
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,185
Well, this was a pointless excursion.
I'm heading back to the hospital.

170
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,062
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

171
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,899
No. It's my fault
for expecting anything different.

172
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,817
-[door opens, closes]
-[groans]

173
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,736
Can we offer you anything on your way out?

174
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,530
You want a Wurlitzer or a spleen

175
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,699
or an industrial-sized tub
of general anesthesia?

176
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,119
Yeah, give me the anesthesia.

177
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,372
[Diane] You could sneak in
during the party

178
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,333
as long as nobody's estranged husband
who's a cop is visiting.

179
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,876
Holiday party, huh?

180
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,629
-What? Where am I?
-You're in Chicago!

181
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,298
-Hi, I'm Diane. This is Guy.
-How you doin'?

182
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,509
Oh! Are you ready for introductions
or are you still processing

183
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,970
the whole being kidnapped
across state lines?

184
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,221
I'm sorry, what?

185
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,348
We're breaking
into the Whitewhale building.

186
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,892
-Why?
-To get back my kidney and save Mom

187
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,770
and prove to you
that I'm not just a wacky screw-up

188
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:26,065
who engages primarily
in goofy whimsical mess-arounds.

189
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,901
-How did you get me on the plane?
-We did a <i>Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

190
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,239
-[groans]
-As I was saying,

191
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,408
tonight's the Whitewhale
employee holiday party.

192
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,119
Security will be tight, but you can use
my employee ID to get in,

193
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,912
because I'm technically
still on the payroll.

194
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,290
Wait, you didn't quit?
We haven't worked there in months.

195
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,584
Nobody's noticed!
They keep sending me checks.

196
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,170
Cashing them is my way of very gradually
taking down the man from the inside.

197
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,300
Hey. C-- can we sidebar for a minute?
Is this really the best use of your time?

198
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,177
You've been beating yourself up
about how slowly the book's going. So...

199
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,431
But the book is about me
and my life, so by living my life,

200
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,308
I am in fact working on the book.

201
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,351
You don't have to write this book
if you don't want to.

202
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,436
Of course I want to.

203
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,564
Okay. I'm just saying, since you started,
you've been pretty down.

204
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,567
-Not yourself. Diane--
-Actually, pretty down is myself.

205
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,569
Can we talk about this later?
We're being rude.

206
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,738
Why don't you offer them
one of your fancy beers?

207
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,658
So, all we need to do
is get into the party,

208
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,954
figure out where the kidneys are,
find my kidney, and sneak out,

209
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,165
all without drawing attention
to ourselves.

210
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,876
And be careful, because
if Jeremiah Whitewhale catches you,

211
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,461
he can legally murder you.

212
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,630
Now, can I get anyone an imperial stout?

213
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,758
The barley was from Portland, Maine,
but the brewery is in Portland, Oregon!

214
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,134
This plan is ludicrous.

215
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,470
Hey, maybe instead
of criticizing everything

216
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,306
like you've done my entire life,
you can get on board?

217
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,432
It's gonna work out.

218
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,643
Things don't just work out, Todd!

219
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,604
Of course they do!
I don't know why you're so negative!

220
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,897
Do you want to help Mom,

221
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,858
or do you wanna just go back
to the hospital and wait?

222
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,153
[sighs] Okay. I'm in.

223
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,489
[thunder rumbling]

224
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,451
I don't feel comfortable negotiating
without my fellow assistants present.

225
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,827
Yeah. This is not about that.

226
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,871
Good, because our demands haven't changed.

227
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:08,209
Casey, it's been so thrilling to see you
grow into your role as strike captain.

228
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,880
[gasps] You know, there's an opening
at my company for a development exec.

229
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,548
I don't suppose you'd be interested?

230
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,175
Oh! Uh...

231
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,552
I'd have to think about it.
I've never rea--

232
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,221
You'd get overpaid to read scripts,

233
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,057
company credit card,
and a parking spot in the good garage.

234
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,685
-Um...
-Plus, your own assistant.

235
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,188
-An... assistant?
-[thunder rumbling]

236
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,441
-That is, of course, if the strike ends.
-[giggles]

237
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,861
Well, that's a very generous offer,

238
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,030
but I'd have to talk it over
with my colleagues.

239
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,116
Why? Those are assistants.

240
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,494
You're not one of them anymore.
You're one of us.

241
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,830
It's a two-year contract.

242
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,207
Sign right there
and your troubles are over.

243
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,585
[breathes heavily, exhales]

244
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,503
[thunder strikes]

245
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,797
[groans, shrieks]

246
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,261
[both cackling]

247
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,638
-[Ruthie giggles]
-What's so funny?

248
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,349
I was just remembering a funny joke,
unrelated to this.

249
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,809
Can you tell me what it is?

250
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,811
You wouldn't get it.
It's about Zsa Zsa Gabor,

251
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,021
and it's no longer appropriate
in today's climate.

252
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,232
You've made the right decision.
You're gonna love the new job.

253
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,776
-Welcome to the team, Stacey.
-It's Case--

254
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,030
[both] Hmm...

255
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,410
Hey! [grunts]

256
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,579
Sign here to run development

257
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,499
for Saoirse Ronan's production company,
Saoirse and Rescue.

258
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,419
[Turteltaub] Mm-hmm.

259
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,381
I can't be an assistant anymore!

260
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,675
Shirley MacLaine threw a cactus at my head

261
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,762
because I set a meeting
with the wrong Steve McQueen!

262
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,265
How was I supposed to know
she meant the dead one? [cries]

263
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:50,644
Shh. It's okay. Just sign here
and orchestrate your own great escape.

264
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,939
[Princess Carolyn chuckles]

265
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,858
[Turteltaub] Ooh.

266
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,905
[car horns honking]

267
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,573
Okay, I'm going in.

268
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,493
Todd, promise me
you'll be perspicacious in there.

269
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,911
Perspicacious?

270
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,205
-I don't know the meaning of the word.
-[sighs]

271
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,001
-You're Diane?
-Yes!

272
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,961
-Nguyen?
-That is correct!

273
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,546
I find that hard to believe.

274
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,298
Wow, that's racist.

275
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,967
People don't always
look like their last names.

276
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,305
For example, I'm white,
and my last name is Chavez.

277
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,265
I thought your last name was Nguyen.

278
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:32,937
-Oh! Uh, yeah, it is! Todd Nguyen.
-Not Diane Nguyen?

279
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,897
Oh, yeah! Diane Nguyen.

280
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,443
That's me, all right,
or my name isn't Todd Chavez.

281
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,570
Well, that was a bust.

282
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,574
Okay, this time,
you're Diane and I'll be Jorge.

283
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,742
Todd, get in the trash can.

284
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:51,789
I know I'm a disappointment to you,
but I do not live in a trash can, Jorge,

285
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,416
and I haven't for several years now! Hey!

286
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,501
[both grunting]

287
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,129
[speaking in Spanish]

288
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,131
Uh... What? Sorry, I...

289
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,635
Oh. No Español? [speaking in Spanish]

290
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,514
Uh... go ahead.

291
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,558
[indistinct chatter]

292
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:17,731
-Wow, that was amazing!
-No. That was logical and straightforward.

293
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,905
-Another club soda, please.
-[Doctor Champ] Nerd!

294
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,615
Doctor Champ, what is your plan?

295
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,576
Just gotta drink enough to be steady.

296
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,328
Then, you take me back to Pastiches
and keep me out of trouble.

297
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,999
That way, you don't have to go home
and I can be a good therapy horse.

298
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:39,086
All my clients get sober, I am a winner,
put my picture on a magazine. [slurps]

299
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,547
Look, I can't let you go back there drunk.

300
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:46,051
You don't care about me!
You're scared of this guy.

301
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,389
You can't help anybody else
unless you're honest with yourself.

302
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,017
-Know what I mean?
-No. I never know what you mean.

303
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,935
In fact, maybe I wouldn't be so scared

304
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,146
if you'd given me real therapy
over the last six months

305
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,523
instead of just plying me
with folksy aphorisms.

306
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,776
I'm not a therapist! I'm a therapy horse,

307
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,570
a subtle but legally
important distinction.

308
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,323
Besides, you wouldn't accept
real therapy from me.

309
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,365
Oh, and why's that?

310
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,076
Gee, I don't know,
maybe because I'm a horse,

311
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,369
so I remind you of your father,

312
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,789
so you simultaneously resent me
and crave my approval,

313
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,625
an approval which,
ironically, if granted--

314
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,168
Yeah, I would dismiss immediately

315
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,837
and then use as an excuse to resent you
even more, what's your point?

316
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:26,050
My point is, you're stunted from having
healthy relationships with horses, idiot!

317
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,718
Oh, really? Well, if that were true,

318
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,970
I would have almost
no other horses in my life.

319
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,222
Right, it's almost as if all your friends

320
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,142
and loved ones
are humans or dogs or cats--

321
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,561
But then how do you explain
the one horse I do care about,

322
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,230
my half-sister Hollyhock,
who is also a reminder of my father?

323
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,275
If your theory were true,
wouldn't I keep her at arms' length,

324
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,861
desperate for her to love me
but unwilling to be vulnerable enough

325
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,862
to allow her to hurt me?

326
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,073
You blockhead, she's not your father!

327
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:53,160
Hollyhock reminds you
of the horse you hate the most. Yourself!

328
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,453
Okay, you got me!

329
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,331
My parents gave me an internalized
self-hatred of horses.

330
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,125
So, my horse body is a prison
that I can never escape.

331
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,752
This manifests in rotten behavior

332
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,254
because I subconsciously believe
I deserve to be punished,

333
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,383
but being famous, I'm never punished,
so I act out even more.

334
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,094
And since this pattern
is so woven into my identity,

335
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:14,181
it is unfathomable to me that it can
ever be curbed, so instead, I drink!

336
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,183
Uh... Check, please!

337
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,936
So, the only way I can progress
is to return to my life as a sober man

338
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,064
and finally hold myself accountable
for my actions, past and future.

339
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,483
Oh, my God, is this what therapy is?

340
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,318
Why do you keep bringing me checks?

341
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,361
[glasses clanking]

342
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,030
Uh... Doctor Champ?

343
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,324
[elevator dings]

344
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,284
Wow.

345
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,661
-Sorry, folks!
-[both gasp]

346
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,079
This floor's off-limits.

347
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,831
-Oh, but...
-Oh, thank God you're here!

348
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,583
I saw someone at the buffet
putting ketchup on a hot dog.

349
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,461
-What? Not in my town!
-[keys jangling]

350
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,754
[elevator dings]

351
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,465
-Wow, you are really good at this.
-Let's go.

352
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,927
[gasps] Ooh, wow. Hmm.

353
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:57,766
Oh, look. People who selected kidneys
might also enjoy small intestines.

354
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,686
Just the kidney. We don't need
to be up-sold on other innards.

355
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,021
Yes, sir.

356
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,272
[beeps]

357
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,067
Thank you for... [clears throat] this.

358
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,487
Uh. Once your mother is okay,
we will never bother you again.

359
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,157
-I know that's what you want.
-Why would I want that?

360
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,704
-You never understood me.
-I raised you as my own flesh.

361
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,498
I was tough on you
because I expected big things from you.

362
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,083
You weren't tough. You were mean.

363
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,169
-Because the world is mean!
-Not my world!

364
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,129
I wanted so much for you, Todd.

365
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,425
I wanted to push you to be your best self.
I see now that I failed you.

366
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,303
But you didn't fail me
because I am not a failure.

367
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,180
Look... [sighs] Okay, Todd.

368
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,476
Why do you need to be proud of me
on your terms?

369
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,229
Why can't you see I'm living a good life?
I have friends. I have a job--

370
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,066
You sleep on the couch
and you play with puppets all day.

371
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,027
I'm happy, Jorge.
What more do you want from me?

372
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,612
I want to know that you're okay!

373
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,031
Then why haven't you called in ten years?

374
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,117
You don't think I wanted to?
I'm not the one who...

375
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,869
-What?
-[Jorge exhales]

376
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,663
She loves you, your mother.

377
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,125
But she's very proud.
If you called her, she would talk to you.

378
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,046
Well, she can't talk now
because she's in a coma, right?

379
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,464
[sighs] Yeah.

380
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,385
What are they talking about?

381
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,389
-Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
-[keys beeping]

382
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,809
[groans] Chavezes! You got company!

383
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,477
Get out of there now! Do you read me?

384
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,479
[Diane on radio] <i>Hello? Hello?</i>

385
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,482
Diane? Why is there a walkie-talkie
in our kitchen?

386
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,067
-God damn it!
-[man] Uh...

387
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,196
Excuse me? This garage
is for shopping center customers only.

388
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,406
[groans] Okay, fine, I'll buy a pretzel.

389
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,576
-Or you could just leave.
-No, now I want the pretzel.

390
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,163
[Guy]<i> Hey, Diane, get me a pretzel,</i>
<i>too, please. Love you, okay?</i>

391
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,874
[Jorge gasps] Someone's coming.
We have to go.

392
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,751
I'm not going until I get my kidney.

393
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,254
-Todd, this is serious.
-Yes, I understand.

394
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,588
You are very serious.

395
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,675
You read serious books
and listen to Sirius XM.

396
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,884
We have to go right now.

397
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,929
-Hey!
-Why do you always fight me?

398
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,849
Why do you always try
to make me leave places?

399
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,850
-[man] Hey!
-[both gasp]

400
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,434
Stay right where you are!

401
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,230
-Whoa! [exhales]
-[grumbles]

402
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,566
Um...

403
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,442
[sighs]

404
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,070
[groans]

405
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,285
Uh, I'm sure the other assistants
will be here any minute.

406
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,370
Traffic's real bad because of the rain.

407
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,247
No one else is coming, Stuart.

408
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,375
-Uh... because of the rain?
-They got promoted.

409
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,501
Your ranks are divided.

410
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,296
Your leadership has abandoned you.
Face it, the strike is over.

411
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,965
Whoa. Okay.

412
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,758
We've drawn up a new collective agreement.

413
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,511
You get none of the things you asked for
and you start work again Monday.

414
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,804
Sounds fair.

415
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,308
If I sign this, does that mean
I get a promotion, too?

416
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,644
-Sure, Stuart. Someday.
-[gasps]

417
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,231
[Marv] Princess Carolyn,
I'd love to give you a raise,

418
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,941
but you're thinking like an assistant.

419
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:58,238
Any day now, you're gonna get promoted
to agent and sign a brand-new contract,

420
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,451
so why are you concerning yourself
with these assistantly trifles?

421
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,912
You really think I have
what it takes to be an agent?

422
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,749
Someday, sure!
But for now, you're my assistant,

423
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,626
and since you've got a similar build

424
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,212
to the angry lady
I fell on at the post office,

425
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:19,009
I need you to try on these apology bikinis
and report back where they pinch.

426
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,053
-[groans]
-You got it, boss.

427
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,512
[gasps] Oh.

428
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,891
-[Stuart] Um...
-Stuart, don't sign that!

429
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,560
I just remembered
there's a typo on page 12!

430
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,688
Instead of "billable hours,"
I wrote, "Billy Bob showers!"

431
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,357
Ooh, that's not gonna fly, P.C.

432
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,859
That guy hasn't showered since <i>Bad Santa.</i>

433
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,779
<i>Man Who Wasn't There?</i>
More like "Man Who Doesn't Wash There."

434
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,822
<i>Sling Blade?</i> More like "Please Bathe!"

435
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:45,118
<i>Monster's Ball? </i>More like "Monster Balls."
Great actor, though.

436
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,620
Let me fix up a new version

437
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,413
and you can come back
and sign it tomorrow.

438
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,957
I'll walk you to your car.

439
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,380
Well, this is my car.

440
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,632
-Really?
-No. I don't own a car.

441
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,926
[scoffs] So why did we walk
three blocks in the rain?

442
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,429
I panicked! I've never been in charge
of where to go before!

443
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,099
You're clearly out of your depth
in these negotiations.

444
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,308
Take this number.

445
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,728
Wow. This a lot of money,
Princess Carolyn.

446
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,523
That's not an offer, it's a phone number!

447
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,441
Oh...

448
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,279
-Can you drive me home?
-[sighs]

449
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,574
-Officer, I...
-Sir, did this man attack you?

450
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,994
-What? No.
-You can tell me if he attacked you.

451
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:31,498
-Hey! Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
-Look, this is all a misunderstanding.

452
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,084
I'm just trying to take
this kidney back to my mom.

453
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,879
Whitewhale's got like a hundred of these.
He won't even miss this one.

454
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,757
Well, aren't you a little scamp.

455
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,467
-[both laugh]
-Oh, stop!

456
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,719
What?

457
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:51,476
<i>Armageddon? </i>More like "Arma-gettin'
Away From This Stinky Guy!"

458
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,770
What the...? Hey, who's in my chair?

459
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,732
Mr. Turteltaub,
I thought our meeting was at 9 a.m.

460
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,775
-It appears to be 9:03.
-[sighs] Hello.

461
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,069
If you're serious about negotiating,

462
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,655
it's imprudent to send the message
you don't respect our time.

463
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,866
To start these negotiations
on the right foot,

464
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,368
I suggest we adjourn for the day
and start in earnest tomorrow.

465
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,871
-On schedule?
-Um...

466
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,707
-Okay?
-Fabulous. Princess Carolyn.

467
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,833
Judah.

468
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:19,004
-What the shell was that?
-Let the negotiations begin.

469
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:29,723
[clears throat]
Todd, I, uh... owe you an apology.

470
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,975
-Oh?
-[inhales, exhales]

471
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,771
I know I was hard on you
when you were growing up,

472
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,397
but I was trying to protect you.

473
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,274
Nothing came easy for me.

474
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:43,487
It took hard work, focus, discipline
to get me where I am today.

475
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,906
Things didn't just work out.

476
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:49,326
But I should have realized: you're white.

477
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,495
I forgive you.

478
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,579
She's awake.

479
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:56,416
Do you wanna come say hello?
I'm sure she would love to see you.

480
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,044
Well, she has my number.

481
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,171
-That's cold, Todd.
-What do you expect?

482
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,090
I'm a Chavez, right?

483
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,468
Hmm...

484
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,889
{\an8}[groans]

485
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,850
-Huh? Where am I?
-You're at Partridges,

486
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,019
the rehab clinic
founded by Danny Bonaduce.

487
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,855
-What about Pastiches?
-I told them I was checking you in here.

488
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,940
Why would you do that?

489
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,150
Those people need me
to be an example of success.

490
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,070
You can't help anybody else
unless you're honest with yourself.

491
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,031
-A wise man told me that.
-Who? What wise man?

492
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,242
You did.
I was being poetic and you ruined it.

493
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,452
Well, don't listen to me. I'm a drunk!

494
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,788
Yeah. But the first step is admitting it.

495
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,583
You've destroyed me.
I can never go back to Pastiches now.

496
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,460
My husband will leave me.

497
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,713
I promised him I would never drink again
after what happened to our daughter.

498
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,882
Uh... What happened to your daughter?

499
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,970
You know nothing of my life
and you think you know what's best for me?

00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,139
The only reason I got drunk
in the first place

501
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,015
is because of your contraband vodka!

502
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,185
-Well, yes, technically, that's true.
-Of course you did this to me.

503
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,312
Because I cared about you.

504
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,065
And you ruin people who care about you.

505
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,109
[exhales] Well, best of luck.

506
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,780
I want you to remember this, BoJack.
I want you to remember what you did to me.

507
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,494
I remember everything. I'm sober now.
