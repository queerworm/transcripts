A hummingbird smiled at me
on my walk this morning.

4
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:19,436
In small pleasures such as this,
I'm reminded of the presence of the Lord.

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,938
-As you ought.
-And yet...

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,399
-No.
-Out with it, Sister Marguerite.

7
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,776
To hesitate is to waste time,

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,447
which is a sin when time
could be elsewise spent in prayer,

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,200
or handwashing Monsignor Toscani's
1962 Alfa Romeo,

10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,911
which is itself a form of prayer,
is it not?

11
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:41,499
Of course. Yet I find myself consumed
by thoughts of my past.

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,877
You have no past. You've confessed.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,837
Your sins have been washed clean.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,757
This is like day one stuff,
what are we talking about here?

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,844
The people I've hurt,
the lives I've ruined,

16
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,929
are they washed clean as well?

17
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,098
Your regrets are of no benefit
to the Lord.

18
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:01,561
Ruminating so is a solipsism unbefitting
a sister of the cloth.

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,939
Is it solipsism to be concerned
with the fates of others?

20
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,609
Perhaps one could argue
cloistering oneself from the world

21
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,986
is itself a form of solipsism.

22
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,822

23
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:17,535

and you didn't talk for like two years?

24
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,871
I will trouble you no further, Mother.

25
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,041

with so vexing a pupil.

Yes, mine was a storied run

You could fill a library

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,728
{\an8}and I didn't think I'd visit long,

with the windows up. [chuckles]

I get an extra bucket of bacon-blasted
chicken fingers just for her,

about this content

145

is that it's not a commercial.

146
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,484
Right, I forgot about the innovative part
of it. Excuse me.

they're being advertised to,

as well as dunking on the olds.

But maybe I can find takes
that are in more of a dunking tone,

155

as well as shots
that highlight more prominently

156

00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,202
If you'd told me that one day
you'd be doing chicken commercials--

165
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,578
-Not a commercial.
-That you'd be doing

166
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,583
sponsored content pre-roll
for <i>Beverly Hillbillies </i>reruns on Gronkle

167
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,169
while I'm directing another
action-adventure blockbuster,

168
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,130
this one set in the world
of competitive ballroom dancing,

169
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,217
working title, "Balls to the Wall,"
if you'd told me that...

170
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,301
You'd be super-stoked?

171
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,261
Yeah, first, I'd be really stoked,

172
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,640
but then eventually,
I would get around to being outraged.

173
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,100
-[coughing]
-[groans]

174
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,187
It is fun that we're both working
on the same lot, though.

175
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,605
-Right?
-Yeah.

176
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,815
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Sorry.

177
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,984
-What now?
-[man speaking indistinctly]

178
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,069
Again? Okay.

179
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,529
-Yeah. I'll talk to her.
-[phone beeps]

180
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,325
What are these new pages?
Why do I have new pages?

181
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,535
You don't like the new pages?

182
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,663
[groans] The content of the pages
is not the issue, Justin.

183
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,831
-Yeah.
-I spent time preparing the other pages.

184
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,749
You understand?

185
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,710
I rehearsed them. I studied them.
That's precious time I'll never get back!

186
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,129
And then some person--
I don't know this person--

187
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,550
And by the way, I don't like strange
persons knocking on my door

188
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,678
and then letting themselves in.
The knock is so I can tell you to enter.

189
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,721
If you just enter,
 what is the purpose of the knock?

190
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,722
You're right, of course.

191
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,518
My point is about the pages.
Why are you throwing new things at me?

192
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,562
The insurance guys are nixing
the car chase.

193
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,731
We had to think fast, so we put together
a new hand-to-hand combat scene

194
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,358
we're gonna throw on top
of the meringue number.

195
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,694
-So, it's a stunt?
-I thought you'd be excited.

196
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,114
I'm excited!
It's more time spent on your face.

197
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,492
Ever since I directed you in that episode
of "FBI: Female Body Inspectors,"

198
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,953
I thought... [chuckles]
"I gotta give this woman her close-up."

199
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,289
Don't produce me, Justin.

200
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,583
[sighs] Is there choreography?
When am I learning this stunt?

201
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,919
April's gonna be on set.
She'll make sure you understand the stunt.

202
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,255
-And it's gonna be safe?
-We are taking every precaution.

203
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:53,050
And we are not gonna shoot
until you are 100 percent comfortable.

204
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,052
Thank you.
I didn't mean to bite your head off.

205
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,680
-I just don't like being surprised, okay?
-Totally my fault.

206
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,015
I should've warned you.

207
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:03,019
Is there something else going on
that I should know about?

208
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,771
I'm fine. I'm actually being
really cool here.

209
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,190
I'm not some kind of monster
just because I don't like surprises.

210
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,693
I'm number one on the call sheet.
I'm entitled to a little respect.

211
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,694
No, you're right.

212
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,196
I mean, I've worked on projects
where the number one on the call sheet

213
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,825
was like an actual crazy person,
so I think I'm being really cool.

214
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,287
-You are being so cool.
-Yeah?

215
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,622
Mm-hmm.

216
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,167
[sighs]

217
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,044
[Gina] Can you wait
until you're out of earshot

218
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,962
to make your exasperated sighs, please?

219
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,839
Yes, sorry!

220
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,799
[jazz music playing]

221
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,051
[all] Huh? [dogs panting]

222
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:40,431
[chuckles] Kelsey! You can't
compare yourself to Justin Kenyon.

223
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,268
-What's the difference?
-The difference is he has a great agent.

224
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,812
[chuckles] That was a joke,
but I see you're in no mood.

225
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,064
I'm a good director.

226
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,858
Yes, but Justin's movies
make actual money.

227
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,778
The last big movie you were on,
you got fired off of.

228
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,112
Explain this to me.

229
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,323
I didn't break
into the Nixon Library alone

230
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,034
and yet I'm the only one
whose career has suffered.

231
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,202
Why do you think that is?

232
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:05,206
Kelse, I don't know by what fancy
the fates push us about

233
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,999
in their great cosmic dance.

234
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,627
-I am but an agent.
-What about these stories I keep hearing

235
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,338
about how people wanna hire
more female directors?

236
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:17,551
Oh, they want to, they want to so bad.
Just not for this particular project.

237
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,719
Which particular project?

238
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,097
Anyone. I mean, you name it.
Whatever Paul Feig's doing.

239
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,057
You need to get me out of director jail.

240
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,061
Even Roman Polanski works more than I do,
and he should be in actual jail.

241
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:31,440
[laughs] Yeah, for his last
couple of movies, at least, right? Woof!

242
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,151
No. Not for his last couple of movies.

243
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,196
Carol, be a doll and tell this dame
what you told me.

244
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,658
I just don't understand
why my daughter would start using again.

245
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,661
She was sober.
She was going to AA meetings.

246
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,995
You suspect foul play?

247
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,374
Listen to this,
the last voicemail I ever got from her,

248
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,959
-a month before she died.
-[beeps]

249
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,377
[Sarah Lynn] <i>Hey, Mommy.</i>

250
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,088
I got out of a meeting
and we're making amends,

251
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:59,176
so I just wanted to say I'm sorry
I'm such a disappointment. [chuckles]

252
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,929
I'm sorry my platinum records clashed

253
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,141
with the chic minimalism
of your new sun room.

254
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,602
And I'm sorry I didn't introduce you
as my older sister

255
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,439
when we met David Hasselhoff
at the Kids' Choice Awards.

256
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:16,902
And I'm sorry I've never been
enough for you, Mommy!

257
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,156
What an angel.
She just wanted me to be happy.

258
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,699
What is the "we"?

259
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,743
-What?
-Yeah! At the beginning.

260
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:28,164
She says, "We're making amends."
Who's this "we"?

261
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,499
[camera shutter clicking]

262
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,089
You know, we don't have to go
to this party if you don't want to.

263
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,217
What? I'm the one who keeps saying,
"Let's go to the party."

264
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:44,638
The only reason I came down here was so
we could go to this party and get drunk.

265
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,683
Come on. I've gone to like
a hundred parties with you.

266
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,560
You always say you're gonna drink,

267
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,188
and you never do, which is fine,
by the way!

268
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,148
No one's ever offered me a drink.

269
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,400
I keep waiting
for this famous peer pressure

270
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,487
I've heard so much about
and it never happens!

271
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,616
You wanna go have a drink? Here I am,
your peer, pressuring you.

272
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,867
[chuckles]

273
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:10,247
I'm nervous about losing control,
you know?

274
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,751
I think drinking alcohol
might not be for you.

275
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,879
But I don't wanna be scared of something
that's supposed to be fun.

276
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,924
That's why I wanna go to that party
with a bunch of strangers.

277
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,969
Because if I'm gonna lose control, I don't
want it to be in front of people I know.

278
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,556
-Okay, weirdo.
-[chuckles] You're a weirdo.

279
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,604
Because I am not a thing to be fixed,
Daddy.

280
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:38,442
Do you think we should ADR her saying
"Daddy-o"? Is "Daddy-o" more of a dunk?

281
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,486
-[groans]
-[cell phone rings]

282
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,112
-Hello?
-Um, hello?

283
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,533
Am I speaking
to the future director of "Fireflame"?!

284
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,453
-What's that?
-"Fireflame"! It's a superhero movie!

285
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,746
Ugh. Another one?

286
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,291
Yes, but the difference is this one's
about a lady superhero,

287
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,503
which means this one you could
actually get hired on!

288
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,797
I don't want them to hire me
just because I'm a woman.

289
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,715
Ugh. You think Justin Kenyon says,

290
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,218
"I don't want them to hire me
just because I'm a man"?

291
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,846
Of course not! He says, "Money,
money, money. Nom, nom, nom."

292
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,013
I have heard him say that.

293
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,475
Besides, they don't want this
to be just another superhero movie.

294
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,688
They're looking for someone who can make
a superhero movie with a twist!

295
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,815
So, what, they want me to pitch the twist?

296
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,067
-No, the twist is that it's a woman.
-Oh.

297
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,986
But they do wanna hear your take,

298
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,865
by which I mean they want you,
as a woman, to tell them their take.

299
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:26,991
Hmm...

300
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,368
[man] I've been saying for years

301
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,996
as soon as we run out
of popular male characters

302
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,875
and we've given them each two sequels,
we have to make a movie about Fireflame!

303
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,419
I think that's really edgy
and outside the box.

304
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,672
Outside is exactly where we're trying
to be, in relation to the box.

305
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:45,676
We really think Fireflame can connect
with today's Yas Queen culture.

306
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,721
Yeah, I got a real Yas Queen vibe
from her.

307
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,473
She comes in, she saves the day,
everyone loves her!

308
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,766
-Wow.
-Oh.

309
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,560
Didn't I tell you this would make
a great movie?

310
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,522
Uh, pretty sure I told you, Nancy.
I have always loved Fireflame.

311
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,567
I'm sorry. I remember now,
you did tell me that.

312
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,652
Well, uh, thanks for coming in.

313
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,821
We're obviously gonna hear a lot of takes,

314
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,824
but it seems like you have
a special connection to the material.

315
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,075
I do.

316
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,786
[elevator dings]

317
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,205
[chuckles]

318
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,250
[sighs]

319
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,087
[Paige snorting] Aw. Aha!

320
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,591
I'm famished. Let's find a place where
I can get a glass with an olive in it.

321
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,718
Try to stay on task, won't you, Maxy?

322
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,804
If Sarah Lynn was going to meetings here,
someone must have seen her,

323
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,972
and if someone saw something,

324
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,058
then I wanna know it,
particularly as it pertains--

325
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,561
What crime have I committed
to deserve so long a sentence?

326
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,520
I've got a point.

327
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,397
Once you arrived at it,
send me a postcard.

328
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,441
The starlet was alone
when she died, right?

329
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,860
But there was someone else
with her while she was blotto.

330
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,946
Who was that person? What'd they see?

331
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,031
And why weren't they mentioned
in the police report?

332
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,324
There's your who, what and why.

333
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,452
Get a when and a where in there,
and we've got ourselves a story.

334
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,163
Bully for you, you're almost caught up
to where I was an hour ago.

335
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,415
Let's chat again in an hour
when you've gotten to where I'm at now.

336
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,375
Sounds good.

337
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,252
In the meantime, someone in this building
might just offer the key

338
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,587
that opens the gate to the garden

339
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,006
with the tree that bears the fruit
that is our scoop.

340
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,633
Get someone to squeal on an AA meeting?

341
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:11,762
I do believe one "A"
of the two stands for "anonymous."

342
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,847
The other "A",
I could not possibly fathom.

343
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,850
I envy your faith in the honor
and discretion of other people.

344
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,103
Let's see how that honor stacks up
against the desire

345
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,272
to dish on celebrities
so as to appear swank by association.

346
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,067
Excuse me, kind stranger.
I'm writing a story

347
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,735
-on the efficacy of your program.
-Uh-huh.

348
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,114
I understand one of the pillars
is anonymity, but if you could...

349
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,825
I once saw Craig Ferguson here!
I don't know why I said that.

350
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,326
[gasps] Oh.

351
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,372
I really shouldn't say. It's anonymous,
but I have seen Robert Downey, Jr.

352
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,417
Jamie Lee Curtis winked at me once.

353
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,045
Colin Farrell, Russell Brand,
the Ikea Monkey.

354
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,548
-Sarah Lynn, I've seen.
-Really?

355
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,801
About a month before she died.
It was pretty clear she was using.

356
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,803
Well, how do you figure?
Did she say something?

357
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,139
She didn't, but her friend did.

358
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,557
-Her friend?
-Large fella.

359
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,977
I think he was a horse
or a bull maybe, it's hard to remember.

360
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,939
Kind of like a rounder Brad Garrett type,
but with a very forgettable face.

361
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,400
He told a story, though, I remember that.

362
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,945
It was about a trip he took to...
New Mexico.

363
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,699
-Oh?
-Yeah, it was about a girl and a mother.

364
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,701
Oh, this is so long ago now.

365
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:19,413
I think he had sex with the girl,
or maybe he had sex with the mother?

366
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:23,333
Well, do get your story sorted,
but I'd prefer it if it's sordid.

367
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,044
And this man left with Sarah Lynn?

368
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,172
Do you recall anything else
about this man, his name, perhaps?

369
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,549
No, but I remember the girl's name.

370
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,510
Yes, Sarah Lynn,
now we're all up to speed.

371
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:37,264
No, the girl from his story.
The one in New Mexico.

372
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:41,560
He was weirdly proud of it,
said her name was Penny Carson.

373
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,187
Carson, eh?

374
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,649
"Penny Carson," he said. "And that's
her real name, you can look her up!"

375
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,320
I remember thinking,
"Why does he want us to look her up?"

376
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,655
[both] Hmm.

377
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,994
So she's sexy,
but don't you call her sweetheart.

378
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,623
-[laughs] Boy.
-Oh, that is so Fireflame.

379
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,582
-[yelps]
-Oh, wow!

380
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,541
-Stop!
-What?

381
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,002
-I'm sorry, I can't let you--
-Uh, excuse me.

382
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,296
Are you already-- Sorry.
I'm sure she's got a great pitch,

383
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,548
but the movie you want,
it's just not realistic.

384
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,884
Sure it is.
Wendy Wiggum ate fire as a baby

385
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,513
and now she holds the power
of the Fireflame. It's all very logical.

386
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,890
No, I just mean you're doing this
all wrong.

387
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,351
She saves the day,
and everybody loves her?

388
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,269
I mean, yeah, that makes sense
if she's a man.

389
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,813
But it's never worked like that for me.

390
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,231
Well, this isn't about you.

391
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,984
That's right! It's about an exotic dancer
who's also interdimensional.

392
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,362
No. I mean the rules are different
for women.

393
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,365
If you're a woman
and you save the day, nobody loves you.

394
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,451
People take you for granted,
or worse, they resent you.

395
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,369
They punish you.

396
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,122
The more powerful you are,
the more they'll take your power away.

397
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,542
And I just think if your movie is smart,
you'll acknowledge that.

398
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,128
-Ooh, yeah, sounds like a bummer.
-Yeah, it's a bummer.

399
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,131
Being a superhero is hard.
Otherwise, everyone would do it.

400
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,882
Okay, well, thank you for--

401
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,386
Maybe that is a bad superhero movie.
Not aspirational enough, I don't know.

402
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,139
But it's real. And it's different.

403
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,226
Also, in my version, she's gay. Okay, bye!

404
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,394
[door closes]

405
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,478
[elevator dings]

406
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,647
[sighs]

407
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,234
[chuckles]

408
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,156
[tango music playing]

409
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,950
You're not bad for a beginner.

410
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,118
Wrong on both counts.

411
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,579
I'm no beginner. And I'm very bad.

412
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,331
[both humming]

413
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,625
[groans]

414
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,878
-[shouts]
-Whoa!

415
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,004
Ow! What the hell?

416
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,048
-Cut! Is everyone okay?
-I don't know. Do I have a concussion?

417
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,466
-You fell like a foot.
-[groans]

418
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,343
-Why did you drop me?
-Why'd you scream at me?

419
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,721
-Hey, guys--
-I didn't know he was gonna dip me.

420
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,931
-That's not what we rehearsed!
-You said to have fun with it.

421
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,475
I meant fun energy.
I didn't mean change the choreography.

422
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,644
I can't do this. I am number one
on the call sheet...

423
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,980
-[overlapping dialogue]
-...and all I ask for is a modicum

424
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,149
-Breaking news! She's number one!
-of respect and professionalism.

425
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,817
Okay, let's everybody cool down.

426
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,820
Do not tell me to cool down
like I'm the crazy person here.

427
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,031
I'm just trying to have
a safe workplace environ--

428
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,575
I had you.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

429
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,828
-I'm... I'm going home.
-Gina, we need to get this sequence,

430
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,331
-and we are already behind.
-Not my problem.

431
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,918
I get that you're mad, and you're
totally right, but everybody else here--

432
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,628
<i>Not </i>my problem.

433
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,880
-[Gina sighs]
-[grunts]

434
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,382
You got that dip, though, right?

435
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,551
[dance music playing]

436
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,391
Okay. Trey and I will be in the coatroom,
doing hand stuff.

437
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,853
-Otherwise, you don't know anybody here.
-[chuckles]

438
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,813
[indistinct chattering]

439
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,316
-[grunts] Hey!
-Sorry.

440
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,612
-[gulping]
-[laughing]

441
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,405
[groans]

442
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,157
[snoring]

443
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,618
-[breathing heavily]
-[muffled noise]

444
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,620
[heart beating]

445
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,457
-[man] Oh! What do you see?
-What?

446
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,127
You're having an anxiety attack, so look
around the room and tell me what you see.

447
00:20:54,336 --> 00:21:00,175
I-I see people partying and passing out!

448
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,134
What else do you see?

449
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:06,348
Um, books. Pizza boxes.
I see light fixtures.

450
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,643
I see an odd amount of floor poofs.

451
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,271
-Okay, now say your name.
-Hollyhock.

452
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,815
-Last name too.
-No, we'll be here all night.

453
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,777
-You feel any calmer?
-Yeah, actually. A little bit.

454
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,031
It's a trick my psychiatrist taught me.
It's supposed to help you ground yourself.

455
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,742
-Thanks.
-Except for the saying your name part.

456
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,745
That's not really part of it.
I just wanted to know your name.

457
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,123
Oh. Okay, cool.

458
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,708
I-I'm Peter, by the way.

459
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,919
Just so you don't have to wait for me
to have an anxiety attack too. [chuckles]

460
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,421
-Hollyhock.
-Yeah, I know.

461
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,298
Oh. [chuckles] Right.

462
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,968
So, this party's kind of crowded.
You wanna go get some air?

463
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,096
Yeah. But it's pretty cold out.

464
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,851
-Oh, yeah, that's true.
-But we're wearing jackets!

465
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,144
Also true.

466
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,063
Darling, you must keep the cake cold

467
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,024
and the flowers fresh
for just a moment longer.

468
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,317
This story has revealed itself

469
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,112
to be thornier than a rose bush
and just as sweet. [chuckles]

470
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:05,198
When shall I return?
Well, I haven't sorted that out yet.

471
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,909
It seems I've gone
to New Mexico for a spell.

472
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,161
-[wind howls]
-Whoa!

473
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,288
Well, we're here.

474
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,880
So I wanted to talk to you because
I'm directing a new movie: "Fireflame"!

475
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,675
"Fireflame"? Get that money.
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

476
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,929
Yeah. So I need an actress.
Someone tough, but vulnerable.

477
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,307
I know you're working with Gina Cazador.
What do you think of her?

478
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,686
[stammers] Look, if you've seen her work,
you know what she can do.

479
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,105
She's very versatile. Really talented.

480
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,233
But personality-wise, what's she like?
Is she good to work with?

481
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,278
I can't risk any drama on set.
There's too much riding on this for me.

482
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,531
[sighs] If I'm being honest,
I can't recommend her.

483
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,658
-No?
-Especially if you have a lot of stunts.

484
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,119
I mean, don't get me wrong,
she's great on camera. She just...

485
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,831
-Uh... She can be a little difficult.
-What do you mean?

486
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,541
I don't know what happened.

487
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,835
I worked with her a couple years ago,
she was great, but, um...

488
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,212
[inhales sharply]

489
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,215
Oh, you know who'd be perfect?
Courtney Portnoy!

490
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,841
Oh! I love her.

491
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,843
I've heard nothing but good things.

492
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:10,889
[gulping]

493
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,265
[coughs]

494
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,810
It's fine.
You're not even supposed to like it yet.

495
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,686
It tastes okay-er over time.

496
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,524
Yeah, I'm kind of aspiring to be okay-er
over time myself.

497
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,443
You know, I actually didn't even drink
for like all of college.

498
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,529
I had some shit go down
in high school, and...

499
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,990
You know, there was this girl in my town.
Anyway, it's a long story.

500
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,534
No, I wanna hear it.

501
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:35,497
Okay. She had this man
living in her house.

502
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,416
You mean like more than one dad?

503
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:41,795
No, no, she had just the one dad,
but then there was this other guy.

504
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,672
-Weird.
-Totally weird, right?

505
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,133
Okay. So this girl was best friends
with my girlfriend.

506
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:51,263
We all went to prom together:
me, my girlfriend, the girl, and the man.

507
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,433
Wait, the man went to prom with you?
Yeesh.

508
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,476
That's not even the yeesh-iest part.

509
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,105
This guy bought us bourbon
and practically forced us to drink it,

510
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,274
and then when my girlfriend
got alcohol poisoning,

511
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,526
he just ditched us at the ER.

512
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,194
Was your girlfriend okay?

513
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,947
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, it was scary in the moment.

514
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,408
We were there all night
and they pumped her stomach.

515
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,870
And I was pretty traumatized for a while.
[stammers] But things are good now.

516
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:19,791
Things are good. Because at some point,
I realized it wasn't the alcohol's fault,

517
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,962
or Maddy's fault, or my fault.
It was just some shitty dude, you know?

518
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,338
Totally.

519
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,133
But you know the craziest part of all?

520
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:31,470
The guy, he's actually kind of famous.

521
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,763
-Really?
-Yeah, I never heard of him,

522
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,516
but it turns out
he's kind of a movie star.

523
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,019
Who is he?

524
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,771
[exhales] Um...

525
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,568
