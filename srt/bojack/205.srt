Now, as a chicken, this concerns me.

have wonderful lives

so you can eat them.

00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,066
-Bach? Not Vivaldi? You're insane!
-[clucks]

173
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,985
Yes, I am holding a Bic pen,

174
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,487
but I don't see how that's relevant,
Mrs. Chavez.

175
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,239
-[clucks]
-Sorry. Becca.

176
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,326
-[clucking]
-She's a charming woman.

177
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,912
I do have to look around a little bit,
just so I can say I did my job.

178
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,999
-Uh, don't you need a warrant?
-Only if you're guilty.

179
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,296
[both chuckling]

180
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,924
Well, in that case,
<i>mi casa es su casa.</i>

181
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,177
[both chuckling]

182
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,555
So, if anyone asks,
you were born in La Jolla.

183
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,599
You majored in Communications at USC,

184
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,685
and now you're the booking agent

185
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,270
-for Kings of Leon.
-[clucks]

186
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,981
-Fine, you also book Beck.
-[Diane] Todd?

187
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,066
Aah! I didn't find that thing
in your drawer!

188
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,068
Why are the police outside?

189
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,364
Okay. I met this chicken and she escaped
from Chicken 4 Dayz factory,

190
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,865
and she doesn't speak English,

191
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,617
but she's my best friend
and the cops are looking for her,

192
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,411
and Mr. Peanutbutter went to the spa,

193
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,164
and I love her,
and her name is Becca. Chickenson.

194
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,875
-Todd, breathe.
-But we can't send Becca back.

195
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,878
-They're gonna pump her full of hormones.
-[clucks]

196
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,506
-More hormones.
-[clucking]

197
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,091
I have a plan,
but we gotta get her out of here now.

198
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,720
-Todd, no. Becca doesn't belong to you.
-But she needs our help.

199
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,763
Do you know
how much trouble we'd get in?

200
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,765
There's a policeman
in our front yard.

201
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,519
Uh-oh, here comes
the responsible suburban housewife.

202
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,854
Gonna do whatever the man says.

203
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,605
[sighs]

204
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,691
You're right. Let's get out of here.

205
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,529
So, now you're just gonna do
whatever a teenage girl says?

206
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,780
-Jeezy kableezy, grow a spine.
-[clucks]

207
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,324
Yeah, or a backbone.

208
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,450
Thank you, Becca.

212
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,376
Oh, oh. Well, we're off to the beach.

213
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,795
Just me and my wife,
and our teenage daughter and our maid.

214
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,631
-What? Why am I a maid?
-Silence, maid!

215
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,967
Honey, do you want to sit in the front
or the back?

216
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,221
-[clucks]
-And why not? Maid, you can drive.

217
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,140
Hope there's not too much traffic
on the 134.

218
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,934
Okay, bye-bye, officer.

219
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,520
So long. Have a great day.

220
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,647
Wait a second.
The 134 doesn't go to the beach.

221
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,400
Unless you took it to the 10.

222
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,278
But then why wouldn't you
take the 405 to the 10?

223
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,447
Hold on, this pen isn't a Bic.

224
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,241
No, no, this doesn't add up at all.

225
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,411
Wait! That man's wife was a...

226
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,039

{\an8}Fowl run afoul.
A funky chicken has flown the coop,

229
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,256
{\an8}and for a concerned populace,
the sky is falling.

230
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,550
{\an8}Michael Morgan,
Chicken 4 Dayz CEO,

231
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,262
{\an8}this is a public safety hazard,
and your company is responsible.

232
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,223
Admit it, you counted your chickens
before they hatched,

233
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,850
and now, those chickens
have come home to roost.

234
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,229
Tom, I want to take full responsibility
for this mishap.

235
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,607
{\an8}That's why,
for a limited time, everybody,

236
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:53,194
{\an8}we are offering
our special Full Responsibility Poppers

237
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,197
at participating restaurants
for only $4.99.

238
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,657
Tell me, though, if one sees

239
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,951
this delicious escaped chicken
in the street,

240
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,702
should they approach it, or--?

241
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,081
Oh, no. I want to be very clear
that this is not like a friend chicken

242
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,583
you see at school or work.

243
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,668
This is a special kind of food chicken

244
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,254
that has lived its entire life indoors.

245
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,965
This chicken is not socialized
for the outside world.

246
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,051
-Sounds like my ex-wife. Hey-yo!
-[chuckles]

247
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,428
Oh, Tommy.

248
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,556
Look, the safest place
for this chicken right now is with us,

249
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,975
so we can kill it,
turn it into a sludge,

250
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,936
and then press that sludge
into a delicious patty.

251
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,147
I'd like to take this moment
to apologize

252
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,566
for the earlier crack
about my ex-wife.

253
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,612
Shannon, we shared
14 beautiful years together.

254
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,696
How do you respond to allegations

255
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,117
that factory farming
is "torture," or "cruel,"

256
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,787
or "like a terrifying movie
about some strange dystopian society,

257
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,666
but in this monster story,
the horrifying monsters are us"?

258
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,125
Relax, Tommy,

259
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:53,254
everything we do
is completely legal and FDA-approved,

260
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,507
so, therefore, it is fine.

261
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,134
I have no follow-up questions.

262
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,805
-Okay, Todd, what's your plan?
-What?

263
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,474
You said you had a plan.

264
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:07,477
Oh, yeah. My plan was:
Ask Diane for help.

265
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,770
And now my plan has been completed.

266
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,606
Nice follow-through, Todd.

267
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,483
We have a 'roided out chicken

268
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,652
and the cops on the lookout.
What do we do?

269
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,196
Hey, geniuses,
why don't we take her to Gentle Farms?

270
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,740
Yeah,
no one knows chicken like chickens!

271
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,994
They couldn't say that in the ad
if it wasn't true.

-Yeah! Book Beck. You remember.

-And cut! Company move to--
-Great news, blue-collar types.

Instead of crew lunch today,
your star has arranged

276
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,176
for his favorite burrito truck
to bring you lunch.

It's me, I'm that star!

279
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,057
We're not breaking for lunch yet.

280
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,642
Or we could break for lunch,

281
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,728
and you and I
could get to know each other.

282
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,104
The crew has more work to do.

283
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,440
Once they've had a burrito,
they'll be off their circadian rhythm--

-What?
-Los Angeles P.D.

286
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,278
Are you the owner of a 2002 Volvo

287
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,405
with a "Reelect Al Gore"
bumper sticker?

288
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,031
As relevant today as it was then.

289
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,660
Are you aware said Volvo
is currently harboring a fugitive chicken,

290
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,080
along with a teenage girl,
a small, sprite-like man,

291
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,915
and a maid of some sort?

292
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,376
That's my daughter!
Not the maid. The other one.

293
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,003
I'd wager they're making a run
for Gentle Farms.

294
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,505
Don't worry, though.

295
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,341
We'll bring your daughter home,
dead or alive.

296
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,552
-Alive! Alive!
-We're the L.A.P.D., ma'am.

-We'll probably make the right call.
-Wait, wait, wait--

All right, troops, listen up!

Oh, no! Not until you get a warrant!

Ah, damn it, I hate due process!

You're a loose cannon,

303

No, I'm not. I'm a cannon, maybe,
but a loose cannon?

00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,945
Is that what you think of me?

305
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,656
I think you play
by your own rules.

00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,032
No way,
he thinks rules were made to be broken.

307

These are all attributes
of a loose cannon.

You shut your trap, Fuzzyface.

with nothing to lose.

-That's a different thing.

Yes, I agree, but we can use the car ride
to get some one-on-one.

Every second you waste
finding another ride,

her eyes poked out by a mutant chicken,

Okay, fine. Let's go.

Yay! I'm calling this road trip the 007,

because we are gonna bond.

-[Todd] Oh...
-And we have 20 acres of pasture,

336
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,439
where our chickens have hours
of free play.

337
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,274
See, Todd? She'll be happy here.

338
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,776
[Levi] She sure will.

339
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,154
[both] Because no one knows chicken
like chickens.

340
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,991
Thank you for saving this poultry
from a terrible life at a factory farm.

341
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,201
You're a hero.

342
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,162
But what if Chicken 4 Dayz
tries to get her back?

343
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,081
Don't you worry about your friend.

344
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,834
-That chicken belongs to us now.
-[Diane] Whoa!

345
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,003
-Where'd you get that gun?
-You mean originally, or just now?

346
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,839
-Just now.
-It was in that barrel.

347
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,425
-And what about originally?
-Also that barrel.

348
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,302
Look, Becca,
I know this is hard to understand,

349
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,764
but I have to go,
and you can't come with me.

350
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:31,765
[clucks]

351
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,726
No, no,
you don't need to book Beck anymore.

352
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
Now you can just be a chicken.

353
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,773
See, this is where you belong, okay?

354
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,775
You hear me?
I don't want you no more.

355
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,068
You weren't the best friend I ever had,

356
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:48,155
and I never loved you!
Now get, Becca!

357
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,074
I said get!

358
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,785
[sobbing]

359
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,953
[Becca clucking]

360
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,540
She really stretched out that dress.

361
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,876
She was so horrified,
she checked into rehab.

362
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,420
So, I'm kind of the reason
Drew Barrymore got sober.

363
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,047
Did you like <i>Never Been Kissed?</i>
If so, you're welcome.

364
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,508
Can we have one conversation
that isn't about you?

365
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,969
I don't understand
why you need me to like you.

366
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,264
I don't need you to like me.
It would be fun if you liked me,

367
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,100
because I'd prove my parents were wrong
to never support me,

368
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,728
because I earned the admiration
of an authority figure,

369
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,146
proving I have intrinsic worth,

370
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,231
but it's not a big deal or anything.
Jeez.

371
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,568
Great story. You should put that
in a podcast, so I can unsubscribe.

372
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,487
Can this piece of junk go any faster?

373
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,156
It's been screwy since I hit that deer
a couple weeks back.

374
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,574
Probably should get it checked out.

375
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,492
[tire blows]

376
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,744
[both yelling]

377
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,121
[sighs]

378
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,206
Probably should've gotten it checked out.

379
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,839
-Those farmers seem nice.
-Yeah.

380
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,257
I think Becca will be really happy there.

381
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,968
She'll have a nice life.

382
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,012
Yeah, until they kill her.

383
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,516
Well, yeah, but of all the places
that will eventually kill her,

384
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,977
Gentle Farms seems like the best.

385
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,812
This doesn't feel right.

386
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,730
Becca was our friend.

387
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,650
-No. We gotta get her back.
-Uh, what do you mean?

388
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,694
Remember when that guy
cocked his gun and said:

389
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,320
"That chicken belongs to us now"?

390
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,114
He wasn't doing that
because he likes cocking guns.

391
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,326
-Then we'll just bust her out.
-Todd, there's nothing we can do.

392
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,995
Where else would Becca go?

393
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,663
She doesn't even speak English.

394
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,414
Well, we gotta do something.

395
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,250
Look, I know I'm a screw-up
and all my ideas are terrible,

396
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,087
but with Becca,
I was responsible for something.

397
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,923
I had a purpose.

398
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,719
Ah. I guess you wouldn't understand.

399
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,262
[groans]

400
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,139
-[tires screeching]
-[Irving and Todd yell]

401
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,142
-Oh, my God, Diane!
-All right. Let's bust her out.

402
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,979
Yes! Okay, and afterwards,
will you get me an iPad?

403
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,024
-What? No.
-But I really want an iPad.

404
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,943
Maybe you wouldn't understand.

405
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,152
Don't push it.

406
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,534
All right, all right, we've agreed.
He's a loose cannon, but he gets results.

407
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,203
-I can live with that.
-Now, you go bust those perps.

408
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,372
You'll need a maverick,
a by-the-book rookie,

409
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,208
and a curmudgeonly veteran
one week from retirement.

410
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,459
Go, go, go!

411
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,377
[men speaking indistinctly]

412
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,461
[news theme music plays]

413
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,965
We have received word that authorities
are now en route to Gentle Farms

414
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:15,135
in an attempt to preempt
the pursued poultry at the pass.

415
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,764
Do we have a graphic for this? No?
Where's the graphic?

416
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,307
No, I'm not gonna go on
until we have a graphic.

417
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,852
So, make one. I'll wait.
Yeah, hold on, America,

418
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,187
Randy's gotta figure out
how to do his job.

419
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:28,399
Because if I don't have a graphic,
Randy,

420
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,276
people who are just tuning in--

421
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,237
Why am I explaining this to you?
This is basic journalistic--

422
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,616
I swear to God! We'll be right back!

423
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,872
Just got to place the jack
in the right jack apparatus.

424
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,373
There, I have got--

425
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,125
No. I have no idea what I'm doing.

426
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,795
That was me acting.
Pretty convincing performance, huh?

427
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,046
There's more to me--

428
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,048
Are you capable
of experiencing a moment

429
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,800
that you don't then make about you?

430
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,593
What was your plan
to get out of here?

431
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,219
I don't know. Some hick will come by,

432
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,221
and I'll give him an autograph
for a tow.

433
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,891
Boom, his life's changed,
and you and I are on our way.

434
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,436
Oh, my God.
I'm going to lose custody of my daughter.

435
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,814
The only reason I took this movie
is for her.

436
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,024
This is my one shot
at a big studio movie.

437
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,193
If I blow it, I'm back to making small,
critically acclaimed movies

438
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,154
about lesbians learning how to recycle.

439
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,239
You think I want to be an indie darling?

440
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,117
Who's gonna fund Irving's education?

441
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:23,162
-Marla? With her seasonal nut butters?
-Yeah, Marla sucks, right?

442
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,623
Indie-darling daughters
don't go to Brown, okay?

443
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,668
They end up at cute
pat-on-the-back factories like Vassar,

444
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,170
then move back in
with their indie-darling mothers

445
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,131
and make puppet shows
with their tampons,

446
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,257
and they get a profile
in <i>New York Magazine,</i>

447
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,717
and the cycle continues.

448
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,053
Oh, my God, I'm a terrible mother.

449
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,305
Hey, I know terrible mothers,

450
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,058
and you're not a terrible mother.

451
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,269
Hey, aren't you the horse
from<i> Horsin' Around?</i>

452
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,521
And you're the director

453
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,190
of <i>Women Who Love Women</i>
<i>Who Love Recycling.</i>

454
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,193
Give you a lift
in exchange for a couple autographs.

455
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,236
There he is. Right on time.

456
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,326
Shh, shh, shh.

457
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,954
Everyone keep quiet. We gotta--

458
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,540
Ooh. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

459
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,208
[grunting]

460
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,752
[wind chimes tinkling]

461
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,713
[gong sounds]

462
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,007
They probably didn't hear that.

463
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,176
Uh, that's probably a coincidence.

464
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,136
[Levi] Someone broke onto the farm!

465
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,304
Maybe they're rehearsing a one-act play

466
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,223
called <i>Someone Broke Onto the Farm</i>

467
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,017
and someone just said the titular line?

468
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,934
[door opens]

469
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:27,977
[gasps] This way.

470
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,396
-Oh.
-Irving, this isn't safe.

471
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,772
Get in the car, lock the doors.

472
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,733
Don't be a badass
and argue with me--

473
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,317
-Yeah, okay, bye!
-Okay.

474
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,486
Go, go, go! [panting]

475
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,655
Uh...

476
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,075
[clucking]

477
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,325
Becca?

478
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,121
Who's making that ruckus
in my chicken coop?

479
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,956
[all clucking loudly]

480
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,417
-Becca, where are you?
-Becca, are you...?

481
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,335
Becca?

482
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,754
Is this you?

483
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,839
-[clucks]
-Becca?

484
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:00,593
To-- To-- Todd?

485
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,096
Oh, I found her! Diane!
This one's Becca!

486
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,389
No! Todd! Don't you get it?

487
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,226
-They're all Becca.
-Oh.

488
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,644
Okay, go, chickens!
You're free.

489
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,063
Go, run to freedom!

490
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,607
For generations
they will tell your story!

491
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,984
-[Levi] Who goes there?
-Oh, oh, oh, shit!

492
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,736
-We gotta hide!
-Go, go, go!

493
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:19,737
[Todd panting]

494
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,530
Hide, hide! In here!
Someplace safe.

495
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,616
Come on, come on. Oh, no!

496
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,952
[clucking]

497
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,290
-Shh, shh. Becca, no, no, no!
-Shh.

498
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,501
[Levi] Only we know how to care
for these creatures, you hear?

499
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:39,132
Like I say:
No one knows chicken like chickens.

500
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,133
-[cocks gun]
-[laughs]

501
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,425
Oh.

502
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,263
-Diane, I'm sorry I got you into this.
-[sighs] It's not your fault.

503
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,640
I don't know why
I always get into these messes.

504
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,517
You know,
sometimes I feel like my whole life

505
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,021
is just a series
of loosely-related wacky misadventures.

506
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,942
I think that's just
what being in your 20s is.

507
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,693
-Really?
-Yeah.

508
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,738
I'm supposed to be the adult here,
and I'm a total mess.

509
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,032
You kidding?
You're the coolest person I know.

510
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,243
-Really?
-Yeah. You always know what to do,

511
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,995
and you don't take shit from anyone.

512
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,454
Is that how you see me?

513
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,415
Of course. You're like Lara Croft.

514
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,793
In Diane's body.

515
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:19,338
-[Levi cocks gun]
-[Todd whimpering]

516
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,423
-This is our chance. Let's go!
-Come on!

517
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,549
[Diane] Go, go, go!

518
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,717
[all gasping]

519
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,511
Please. Take me with you.

520
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,972
I hate it here.
I don't want to kill chickens.

521
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:31,225
I want to design video games
that help kids learn math.

522
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,350
Oh...

523
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,061
Whoa!

524
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,772
I am so sorry.

525
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,941
Okay, that was crazy! Just go.

526
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,152
Let's get out of here!

527
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,492
We're free, we're free! Oh, shit.

528
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:49,869
[siren whoops]

529
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,204
[tires screech]

530
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,415
Well, well,
looks like birds of a feather...

531
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,792
go to jail.

532
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,295
-[clucking]
-Why was he wearing sunglasses

533
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,546
at night?

534
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,551
I hope you folks like community service.

535
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,761
-I do.
-What? Oh.

536
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,223
Oh, my God, Irving,
thank God you're safe.

537
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,640
Mom, I'm fine.

538
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,101
Stop embarrassing me
in front of my cool friends.

539
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,229
What? Cool?

540
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:19,481
I mean,
that's cool that you think I'm cool.

541
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,400
I don't care or anything,
but, you know, it's cool.

542
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,653
Hey, this guy.
What'd you get arrested for?

543
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,446
-Being too cute?
-[chuckles]

544
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,698
I want to be in his cell.

545
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:28,908
-[chuckles]
-Listen up, everybody.

546
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,119
I, famous celebrity BoJack Horseman,
have an announcement.

547
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,121
I'm going to ask you to drop all charges

548
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,082
on account of me being a celebrity.

549
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,709
We gracefully accept
the requisite slap on the wrist

550
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,920
and a brief,
but ultimately pointless, trial

551
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,547
in the court of public opinion.
Good day.

552
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,926
Well, you are famous,
so you are all free to go.

553
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,177
[Stone yells]

554
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,470
-But what about Becca?
-Took care of that, too.

555
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,390
Called in a favor with Drew Barrymore,

556
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,226
and she'll pay off Chicken 4 Dayz
to adopt your friend.

557
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,312
Does she have a meadow
that Becca can frolic around in?

558
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,065
You think Drew Barrymore
doesn't have a frolicking meadow?

559
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,858
That is the dumbest thing I've heard.

560
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,484
I learned something today.

561
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,612
When you think
something isn't about you,

562
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,531
you find a way to save the day
and realize that it was,

563
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,909
all along, all about you.

564
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:12,993
[groans]

565
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,288
Plus, I got you all a burrito truck!

566
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,497
-Hooray!
-Yay! I'm great!

567
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:24,213
So, after all that,
the only thing that saved Becca

568
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,590
was that BoJack was friends
with Drew Barrymore?

569
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,218
-Yep.
-So, did anything we did matter?

570
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,928
-Nope.
-I think it did.

571
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,805
I think we made a difference.

572
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,099
A small one, but a difference.

573
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,517
Yeah, I think we did, too.

574
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,854
I think we really changed things
for the better.
