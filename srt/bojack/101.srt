00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,950
Ha-cha-cha.

178
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,451
Who does he think
he's fooling?

179
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,912
Turtles don't have hair.

180
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,163
Stop embarrassing me.

181
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,748
That is Lenny Turteltaub.

182
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,333
You know, I am not crazy
about the bread here.

183
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,416
Mm.

184
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,960
Why do I keep eating it?

185
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,880
BoJack, can you please
just listen for a second?

186
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,175
You have
my undivided attention.

187
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,635
I think
we should see other people.

188
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,763
Were we not
seeing other people?

189
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,224
[moaning]

190
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,142
BoJack, I'm almost there.

191
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,602
Wait. Shh!
Shut up.

192
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,772
<i>Now, that's a horse</i>
<i>of a different...</i>

193
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,856
<i>cruller?</i>

194
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,691
Oh!

195
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,527
God, that's good comedy.

196
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,196
- BoJack!
- What?

197
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,447
Everyone gets a mulligan,

198
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,491
and my mulligan
was Carey Mulligan.

199
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,412
I'm kidding, jeez.
It was Emily Mortimer.

200
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,247
- [scoffs]
- What is the problem here?

201
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,291
Are you embarrassed of me
because I'm a has-been?

202
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,000
Because you know
that I'm writing that book

203
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,002
that is gonna make
everybody love me again.

204
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,963
You're not really
writing a book.

205
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,214
Well, I already
spent my advance,

206
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,548
so that's a first step.

207
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,217
Look, this has been
a lot of fun,

208
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,969
but I need to start
thinking about my future.

209
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,971
I mean, you don't even
respect me enough

210
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,055
to have a baby with me.

211
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,140
Whoa, what?

212
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,682
I never explicitly said that.

213
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,310
You said it with your actions.

214
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,436
What actions?

215
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,521
Oh, look at that baby.

216
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,732
Isn't he the cutest baby
you ever saw?

217
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,234
What? What? What?
No, no, wha--

218
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,611
[horn honks]
[glass shatters]

219
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,988
[car door opens and closes]
[engine turns over]

220
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,990
[tires squealing]
[glass shattering]

221
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,741
[engine revving]

222
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,826
[tires screeching]

223
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,620
[loud crash]
[sirens blaring]

224
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,497
<i>[cop] Step away</i>
<i>from the stolen vehicle, sir!</i>

225
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,333
<i>[BoJack] No, no, no.</i>
<i>Misunderstanding, officer.</i>

226
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,001
<i>I was running away</i>
<i>from my girlfriend</i>

227
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,337
<i>whom I don't respect enough</i>
<i>to have a baby with.</i>

228
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,755
<i>[cop] Hey, aren't you the horse</i>
<i>from </i>Horsin' Around<i>?</i>

229
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,383
Oh, face it.
You're afraid of commitment.

230
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,010
I'm not afraid of commitment.

231
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,636
I commit to things
all the time.

232
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,347
It's the following through
on that commitment

233
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,514
that I take issue with.

234
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,350
Hey, stupid, isn't that
your friend over there?

235
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,934
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter?

236
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,311
God, I hope he doesn't see us.

237
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,562
Is that BoJack Horseman?

238
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,023
Oh, jeez, here we go.

239
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,399
Mr. Peanutbutter

240
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,277
and BoJack Horseman
in the same room.

241
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,612
What is this,
a crossover episode?

242
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,448
You know,
that gets funnier every time.

243
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,033
You're being sarcastic,

244
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,909
but I think it does actually
get funnier every time.

245
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,328
We're actually in the middle
of breaking up right now,

246
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,121
- so if you could just--
- Yeah?

247
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,706
- You're in the middle of it?
- Yeah, that's right.

248
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,750
So would it be awkward
if I joined you right now?

249
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,294
Yes, actually,
it's very awkward.

250
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,545
Is that not clear?

251
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,089
Yeah, this is awkward
right now?

252
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,341
Yes, please leave.

253
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,925
How are you,
Mr. Peanutbutter?

254
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,387
Oh, living the dream, P.C.,
living the dream.

255
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,888
Why are you
making conversation?

256
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,390
Oh, let's see,
it's the English word--

257
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,308
It's called being polite,
BoJack.

258
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,394
But am I crazy
that this is a bad time?

259
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,729
Always a Clydesdale,
never a Clyde, eh, BoJack?

260
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,105
What?

261
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,732
You'll get that one later,
man.

262
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,567
Erica, get out of here
with that face.

263
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,818
Would it kill you to be civil?

264
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,529
This is why we're breaking up.

265
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,572
So it's not because
of the thing with the baby?

266
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,408
It's because
of a lot of things!

267
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,950
Waiter, could we please
have the check?

268
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,536
- Thank you.
- We haven't even ordered yet.

269
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,372
I have wasted so many dinners
on you, BoJack Horseman.

270
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,916
I don't know how you can expect
anyone else to love you

271
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,667
when you so clearly
hate yourself.

272
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,379
- Here you go.
- Let me see that.

273
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,549
<i>$10 for bread?</i>

274
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,259
I don't want to live
in a society

275
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,968
where the premeal bread
isn't free.

276
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,846
It is free
if you order a meal.

277
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,473
Can you take me home, please?

278
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,016
Yeah, but I didn't even
eat that much bread.

279
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,101
What did I have?
I must have had--

280
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,311
You ate nine baskets, sir.

281
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,771
Nine--
really?

282
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,940
Great, now I'm gonna feel like
a fat ass all week.

283
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,777
You've seen me naked.
Do you think I'm getting chubby?

284
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,404
You want to know the real
reason we're breaking up?

285
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,572
What was that?
Sorry.

286
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,907
Couldn't hear you over the sound
of my calories not metabolizing.

287
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,992
This is so classic you.

288
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,411
You're using this bread thing

289
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,329
to avoid talking
about our relationship.

290
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,290
No, that is definitely
not happening.

291
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,083
I'd like to go home now.

292
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,711
You think I'm fat.

293
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,630
So yeah,
technically I was dumped,

294
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,466
but the real headline
of the evening was,

295
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,968
"Dumb guy eats bread,
gets fat, the end."

296
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,387
What kind of headline
is that?

297
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,598
Wasn't there a pizza here
a second ago?

298
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,891
God damn it!
Stop the presses.

299
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,726
You're not fat.

300
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,396
Oh, hey, let's throw a party.
That'll cheer you up.

301
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,982
No, it won't.
It'll cheer you up.

302
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,442
I'll stand in the corner
by myself

303
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,110
eating cotton candy
until I barf

304
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,112
like I did at your last party.

305
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,740
Hey, aren't you the horse
from <i>Horsin' Around</i>?

306
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,160
[retching]

307
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,287
That was a good party.

308
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,123
Hey, didn't we get a cotton
candy machine for that party?

309
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,626
Who told you Princess Carolyn
and I broke up?

310
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,377
- She did.
- What?

311
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,004
You never took me home, jerk!

312
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,839
Oh, everything's my fault.

313
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,508
Take me home.

314
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,551
Okay, jeez.

315
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,386
But I'm not looking
for parking in Silver Lake.

316
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,678
I'll slow the car down
to a crawl,

317
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,763
and you can duck and roll.

318
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,018
You know what, you can take
a last look at this face,

319
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,603
because it's the last time
you're gonna see it.

320
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,686
Hey-up!

321
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,648
[screams]

322
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,026
[cell phone vibrates]
[upbeat tune plays]

323
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,361
Hello?

324
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,778
<i>I've got Princess Carolyn</i>
<i>for you.</i>

325
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,280
Uh, okay.

326
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,532
<i>BoJack.</i>

327
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,116
Oh, my God,
we just broke up.

328
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,784
Yeah, but I'm still
your agent.

329
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,411
I pride myself on my ability

330
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,997
to separate my professional life
from my personal life.

331
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,123
Great.

332
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,334
Then, as my agent,
do you think I'm getting fat?

333
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,502
No way.

334
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,753
You are in the prime of
your life, never looked better.

335
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,005
What about
as my ex-girlfriend?

336
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,965
You look like a pile of crap
ate a second pile of crap

337
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,551
and then crapped out
a third pile of crap.

338
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,136
Wait, wait, so which pile
of crap do I look like?

339
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,055
- The third one.
- What? That's the worst one.

340
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,722
I'm not calling you
as your ex.

341
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,642
I'm calling you
as your agent.

342
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,519
Remember that book
you're pretending to write?

343
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,770
<i>Well, Penguin wants an update</i>
<i>on your progress.</i>

344
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,189
Does Tuesday work for you,

345
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,607
or are you gonna be too busy
this week

346
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,359
masturbating to old pictures
of yourself?

347
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,277
I told you, that's not
