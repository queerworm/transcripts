00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,888
[man on TV] <i>Can't you see?</i>
<i>You don't belong here!</i>

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,808
<i>Destiny has bigger plans for you.</i>
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,396
<i>It's the only home I've ever known!</i>

-[man]<i> You were made for the skies.</i>

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,984
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>they named you Amelia Earhart?</i>

9
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,529
<i>It's because your heart...</i>
<i>belongs in the air.</i>

10
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,157
[reciting Amelia's lines]
It's true, that is my name.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,702
-Ah! Boots, leave your sister alone!
-She started it!

12
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:39,205
Well, stop it right now
or I'll pop the both of you.

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,543
<i>So, put on those flygirl goggles,</i>
<i>get in your biplane and fly to the sun.</i>

14
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,504
[reciting] But a woman's never flown
to the sun before.

15
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,923
<i>Come on! What other gal's</i>
<i>got the get-up-and-go</i>

16
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,802
<i>to tame those savage sun beasts</i>
<i>and become their queen?</i>

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,512
How many times
have you watched this tape?

18
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,806
When you get me a second tape,
I'll watch something else.

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,600
What am I, made of tapes?

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,809
[man] <i>That's the spirit!</i>

21
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,896
[reciting] I suppose the most effective
way to do it is to do it!

22
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,981
[phone buzzing, meowing]

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,362
[sighs] Hello?

24
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,532
How the hell do they expect me to learn
five pages of dialogue in one day?

25
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,284
-What am I, Young Sheldon?
-BoJack--

26
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,829
No show should have that much talking.
TV is a visual medium.

27
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,415
<i>-Anyway, where the hell are you?</i>
-Eden, North Carolina.

28
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,585
Ugh, North Carolina?
That's the second worst of the Carolinas.

29
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,505
-You know I'm from here, right?
-Yeah, and you got out.

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,173
You know what "from" means?

31
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,842
You don't have to be there anymore.
That's why they call it "from."

32
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,678
Okay, I'm about to be
<i>from </i>this conversation.

33
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,348
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Can we just talk about Mr. Peanutbutter?

34
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,642
Why did you cast him on this show?
Everybody loves him.

35
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,394
I'm the guy everybody's supposed to love.
I'm Philbert.

36
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,772
-Ugh!
-So then I got a food truck for the crew

37
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,191
with a big sign that said,
"From your favorite star,"

38
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,276
but everybody thought
it was from Mr. Peanutbutter.

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,778
They didn't even read the sign.

40
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,446
BoJack, I'm gonna be back tomorrow.

41
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,532
Do you think you can handle your shit
until then?

42
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,618
Oh, yeah, that sounds like me.
What are you doing there anyway?

43
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,913
Just... taking care of some family stuff.

44
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,459
[series theme music playing]

45
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,222
Thanks for coming, all this way.

46
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,267
{\an8}-We could've just talked on the phone.
-I wanted to meet you in person.

47
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,102
{\an8}That's the Princess Carolyn difference.

48
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,522
{\an8}Ooh! I've never met a person who had
a difference named after them before.

49
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,609
{\an8}Well, this is important.
We're here to talk about your baby.

50
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,777
{\an8}I know what you're thinking;
another dumb teenager,

51
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,031
so liquored up, she forgot to make sure
her boyfriend wrapped his tweedle.

52
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,575
Well, that's all true,
but I'm not some backwoods hick.

53
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,036
{\an8}-Oh!
-I'm 18, I got my whole life ahead of me,

54
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,622
{\an8}and it's not like my boyfriend's begging
me to marry him.

55
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,290
{\an8}Boyfriends rarely do.

56
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,210
-His name's Strib, short for Dennis.
-Uh, sure.

57
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,961
He's not exactly the romantic type,

58
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,423
but he's got those eyes
you just can't say no to, you know?

59
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,384
{\an8}I hope you and Strib have
many happy child-free years, together.

60
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,138
{\an8}I'm willing to do whatever I can
to help contribute to the child-free part.

61
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,932
-Hmm.
-[phone buzzing, meowing]

62
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,391
Oh, sorry. It's work.

63
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,227
{\an8}Everyone I work with is such a baby.

64
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,395
{\an8}And I love babies!
[laughs]

65
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,688
Hello, baby.

66
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,566
{\an8}Hey, listen, I know Flip
just wants me to be "the woman",

67
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,611
{\an8}and keep my mouth shut,
but this show makes no sense.

68
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,489
{\an8}In the rooftop motorcycle scene,
Fritz and Philbert keep saying,

69
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,575
{\an8}<i>"This is so dangerous."</i>
<i>"Yeah, man. We're really dangerous."</i>

70
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,535
But then they just get off
the motorcycles.

71
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,038
{\an8}Why aren't they skidding
towards the side of the building,

72
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,500
{\an8}and then they roll off just as their bikes
go careening over the edge?

73
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,834
Okay, sure, pitch it to Flip.

74
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,503
Everything I pitch, he shoots down.

75
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,047
That's just because it's coming
from someone who isn't him.

76
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,674
If you want him to like your idea,

77
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,634
just convince him
he thought of it, himself.

78
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,053
{\an8}You really think he'll do it
because I say it's his idea?

79
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,055
That's a great idea, Diane.

80
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,890
Oh, thanks! I'm gonna do it.

81
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,976
{\an8}-So sorry.
-No problem.

82
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,814
{\an8}Um, just so you know, I have met with
some other candidates, mostly couples.

83
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,773
{\an8}Oh.

84
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,234
{\an8}I couldn't believe I found someone
who grew up in Eden.

85
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,404
-When's the last time you were here?
-Oh, not since my mother died.

86
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,906
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-It was a long time ago.

87
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,492
-She's still dead, though.
-That is true.

88
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,203
[sipping]

89
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,748
-Sorry we had to meet at Phuzzy's.
-I love Phuzzy's.

90
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,084
I bet you got fancy restaurants
in LA, huh?

91
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,545
Probably a California Pizza Kitchen
on every corner.

92
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,131
Or do y'all call it "Pizza Kitchen,"
since you're in California?

93
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,259
No, we call it "California Pizza Kitchen,"
or "CPK."

94
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,762
CPK? What kind of city person's too busy
to say "California Pizza Kitchen"?

95
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,724
You gotta catch a bus or something?
Stay a while and say the whole name.

96
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,392
Yeah, yeah, well, I'm not like that.

97
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,103
I live in Los Angeles now,
but you know what they say,

98
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,146
you can take the girl

99
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,190
out of the Greensboro-High Point
metropolitan area, but you can't take

100
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,860
the Greensboro-High Point
metropolitan area out of the girl.

101
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,696
I wish my boyfriend would've taken
his penis out of the girl.

102
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,657
-Meaning, I wish he would've pulled out.
-Yeah, no, I got it.

103
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,326
Thank you.

104
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,994
Ooh, have I missed this!

105
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,121
I'm gonna eat the shit
out of these hush puppies,

106
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,915
and then tomorrow,
I'm getting a real sausage biscuit,

107
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,459
meaning a sausage patty,

108
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,879
not that bullshit link situation
they call "sausage" in LA.

109
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:38,838
[both laughing]

110
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,382
Oh, my goodness, I gotta pee.
I'll be right back.

111
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,177
-[grunts, sighs]
-[phone buzzing, meowing]

112
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,390
-Hello?
-Princess Carolyn!

113
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,478
I just wanted to tell you what a ball
I'm having on this crazy cop show.

114
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,395
Glad to hear it.

115
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,690
And my favorite star paid
for a food truck.

116
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,109
I don't know why Peter Scolari is buying
me a falafel plate,

117
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,861
but, hey, I'm not complaining.

118
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,821
-Did you have a question?
-Yeah.

119
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,657
So, I know my ex-wife is
in the writers' room.

120
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:11,037
I don't want to make things weird for her
or anybody else, so...

121
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,582
do I have to do all the dialogue,
as scripted,

122
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,501
or can I have a little fun with it?

123
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,211
-Um--
<i>-Normally, I wouldn't even ask,</i>

124
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,546
but because of the whole<i> ex-wife</i>
of it all,

125
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,466
I figured I should just double-check
that it's definitely okay

126
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,218
if I change every single word.

127
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,220
Knowing Flip,
I would just stick to the script.

128
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,638
So, don't flip the script?

129
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,766
-Exactly. Don't flip Flip's script.
-<i>That's a double-flip.</i>

130
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,226
So, you're saying I should flip it?

131
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,727
I'm saying the exact opposite.

132
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,397
-So, flip it. Flip it good.
-Okay, I gotta go.

133
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,067
You're very funny and talented.
Goodbye. Sorry. Show folk.

134
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,404
Well, this was a pleasure.
Thanks for coming all this way.

135
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,155
I do hope to make a decision soon.

136
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,242
-Oh, you have to leave already?
-Yeah, I gotta go set up my booth.

137
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,910
-Your booth?
-At the flea market.

138
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,954
I sell clothes I bought cheap
and then bedazzled.

139
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,123
I'm not saying I'm the Danville Target
or nothing,

140
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,624
but it's good enough for fleas.

141
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,543
Okay, call me if you have
any other questions.

142
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,045
I always answer my phone,
day or night.

143
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:01,963
Thanks.

144
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,258

-[water dripping]
-[grunting, sighs]

146
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,770
Your mom's drunk again, isn't she?

147
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,565
My mom, well, obviously she was planning
on cleaning the floors,

148
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,275
but I asked her if I could do it.

149
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,652
I wanna learn all the tricks of the trade,
so one day,

150
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,529
I can be as good a housekeeper
as she is.

151
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,990
Why do you still live here?

152
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,200
Why don't you go live with your dad
down in Raleigh?

153
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,910
All my sisters and brothers are gone.

154
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,745
If I leave, my mom's got nobody.

155
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,624
Besides, if I go,
who's going to keep you out of trouble?

156
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,002
Did you know I'm on the football team?

157
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,588
[chuckles] I do know it.
Are you ever gonna play?

158
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,256
Probably not, smart-ass.

159
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,967
Not unless the first-string quarterback
gets hurt.

160
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,011
Why aren't you
the first-string quarterback?

161
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,804
You're not even
first-string housekeeper!

162
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,056
Well, how about I first-string punch you
in the nose?

163
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,642
Oh! Okay, easy, easy.

164
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,353
Look, I think if I just keep my head down
and be patient,

165
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,939
Coach will eventually realize
I should be QB one, you know?

166
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,816
That's a terrible approach.

167
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,651
You need to go after what <i>you </i>want.

168
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,779
You gotta fly into that sun,
like Amelia Earhart did.

169
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,448
-What?
-You know, like in the movie.

170
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,784
I never knew anybody who liked old movies
as much as you do.

171
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,287
You're 18.
You never knew anybody, period.

172
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,663
Okay, okay.

173
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,000
But what if I'm not as good a quarterback
as I think I am?

174
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,336
Doesn't matter.
You don't need to be good enough.

175
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,671
You just need to convince your coach
you're good enough.

176
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,381
Damn! You know what?

177
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,801
-I'll talk to him tomorrow.
-Don't leave until you get that yes.

178
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,430
-[bell jingling]
-Oh!

179
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,806
[panting]

180
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,518
-Sadie, wait!
-Oh. Um, hey.

181
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,687
Listen, I really want to spend more time
getting to know each other.

182
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,690
This baby, your baby,
means everything to me.

183
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,692
I think the more time we spend together,

184
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,486
-you'll realize I'm--
-[phone meowing]

185
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,447
-Do you need to take that?
-No, it's fine. The perfect candidate.

186
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,033
I thought you always answered your phone,
day or night.

187
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,910
Right. Hello?

188
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,495
I just got off the phone with Flip.

189
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,748
He's really excited about
this new motorcycle stunt he came up with.

190
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,418
-He wants to do it tomorrow, but--
-That's Flip, full of ideas. Gotta go.

191
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,756
Well, the show is already way over budget
and my boss is starting to ask questions.

192
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,343
Now, normally, I love questions
because they're good for pondering,

193
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,095
<i>but I guess in the corporate world,</i>

194
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,557
<i>when people ask questions,</i>
<i>they expect someone to answer them.</i>

195
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,601
And, apparently,
"Yeah, wow, it really makes you think,"

196
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,062
is not the kind of answer
they're looking for.

197
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,063
Goodbye, Todd.

198
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,439
-<i>Wait, one more thing.</i>
-What?

199
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,402
Do you think Lake Erie ever gets jealous
of Lake Superior?

200
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,321
Or is it, like, proud to be the eerie one?

201
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,991
We've been through this, Todd.
Lakes don't have emotions.

202
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,409
What about Ricki Lake?

203
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,580
As I was saying, I'd love to spend
more time together, if you're up for it.

204
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,040
You mentioned the flea market.
I'd love to check it out.

205
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,876
-Yeah, come by anytime tomorrow.
-I thought it was today.

206
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,878
No, no. I just have to prep for it today.

207
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,256
But if you can stay another day,
that would be awesome.

208
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,049
But only if you can. I know you're busy.

209
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,428
I don't want me, or my baby,
to get in the way of your career.

210
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,347
Sadie, I'll be there.

211
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,266
[Sadie grunting]

212
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,976
-[engine starts]
-Toodle-oos! [laughs]

213
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,395
-[gasps] Ah! Oh!
-[phone dialing]

214
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,232
Stuart, I need you to change my flight.
No, just do it through the website.

215
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,444
Yeah, no, go to the website
and put in my confirmation number.

216
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,487
Hold on, let me see if I can find it.

217
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,531
It's 5-2-1-8.

218
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,450
Change it to a Wednesday flight.

219
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,786
No. Oh, okay, click "yes."
Click "yes."

220
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,455
Okay, put in my credit card info.

221
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,582
-I'll text you a picture.
-[camera shutter clicks]

222
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,542
-[phone whooshes]
-Okay, did you get it?

223
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,835
Check your work email.

224
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,796
Okay, click "accept."
Now forward me the confirmation.

225
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,716
Thank you, Stuart.
I don't know what I'd do without you.

226
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,551
[deep breath, sighs]

227
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,180
[Cooper humming] Ow!

228
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,806
-Hey.
-Hey, yourself.

229
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,309
Well, you've been up to something.

230
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:47,688
I'm up to something, all right.
It's called first-string quarterback!

231
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,482
-[cheering]
-Really?

232
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:53,194
-I didn't leave until I got the yes.
-Oh, congratulations! Ah!

233
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,695
-Oh!
-Oops. [chuckles]

234
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,615
-Sorry. I got a little carried away there.
-That's okay.

235
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,824
-[kisses] Oh!
-[gasps]

236
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,242
-Sorry. Sorry.
-That's okay.

237
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,036
[both laugh]

238
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,288
[both moaning]

239
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,300
[man on TV] <i>By Jove, she's doing it!</i>
<i>She's flying to the sun!</i>

240
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,010
<i>That's where she's going.</i>

241
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:22,223
<i>Now we don't need to be sad</i>
<i>when we think about her, later.</i>

242
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,309
-[mom snoring, TV playing]
-[switching off TV]

243
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,562
-I'd be careful if I were you.
-What do you mean?

244
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,940
Think I don't know what's going on?

245
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,983
-Mom.
-Let me tell you something.

246
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,277
Life is a big ol' roulette wheel.

247
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,030
Everyone's got a number.
Some are winners, some aren't.

248
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,658
It all depends
where the little white ball lands.

249
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,203
The problem is when people
with losing numbers think they're winners.

250
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,122
I don't know what you're talking about.

251
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,791
-Then what the hell are these?
-College brochures. I--

252
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,336
You think you're going
to some fancy college in California,

253
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,464
all the way on the other side
of the country from your mother?

254
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,800
-You're gonna abandon me?
-Mom, it's not about you.

255
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,679
UCLA?
No, you will not see LA.

256
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,974
Even if you get into one of these places,
how're you gonna pay for it?

257
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,309
I'll get a job or a paid internship.

258
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:11,313
Well, la-di-da, I did not realize
I was in the presence of someone,

259
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,693
-who was gonna get a paid internship.
-Mom, you need to go to bed.

260
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,821
See, that's the difference
between you and me, Princess Carolyn.

261
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,824
I know where I belong.
This is my bed.

262
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,993
No, it's not.
Where's my bed?

263
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,079
-[phone buzzing, meowing]
-[mom, distorted] I know where I belong.

264
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,832
-Hello?
-<i>I thought you were gonna be here today.</i>

265
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,333
<i>-Where are you?</i>
-Something came up.

266
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,128
Okay, well, listen, Mr. Peanutbutter's
doing all his own stunts,

267
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,797
and every time he does
a dumb little somersault,

268
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,216
everybody goes nuts
like he's goddamn Kerri Strug.

269
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,469
Kerri Strug?
You gotta update your references.

270
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,596
When the world sees
the likes of Kerri Strug, again,

271
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,139
I will adjust accordingly.

272
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,391
<i>Anyway, I said I wanted to do</i>
<i>my own stunts, too,</i>

273
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,019
but little did I know
that Flip was writing a new scene,

274
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,855
where a motorcycle falls off
a five-story building.

275
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,273
Just say you don't want to do it.

276
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,234
<i>I cannot do that</i>
<i>because I already fired my stunt double,</i>

277
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,570
so I also need you to call him
and get him back,

278
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,406
and that might be tricky,
'cause I was really brutal about it.

279
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,325
-Why?
-Because people were watching.

280
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,495
Now I need you to intervene
and forbid me from doing my own stunts,

281
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,997
even though I want to,
because I actually don't want to,

282
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,209
because that would require me to be
in good shape, which we know I'm not,

283
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,294
and also not a coward,
which we both know I am.

284
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,796
-BoJack--
-<i>Also, if you could say</i>

285
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,340
<i>it's because I'm too important a star</i>
<i>to take the risk on,</i>

286
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,217
but Mr. Peanutbutter can keep doing
his stunts

287
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,178
because he is less important;
that would be real cool, thanks.

288
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,429
Fine, I'll handle it!

289
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,723
Just stop whining like a little bitch!

290
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,477
[laughs]
Okay, love you, bitch!

291
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,394
-[beep]
-Hey, girl!

292
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,105
Hey! I'm so glad you came.
This is my stuff.

293
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,233
-I call it Made-y by Sadie.
-Wow!

294
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,151
Problem is got a bunch of lookie-loos.

295
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,028
Everyone's browsing,
but no one's buying.

296
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,572
It's not about people buying.
it's about you selling.

297
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,490
Watch this.

298
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,784
Whoa!
Hey, you can't get that jacket.

299
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,786
-Why not?
-I was gonna get it.

300
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,789
It's the best thing in this whole place
and I saw it first.

301
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,542
So, why don't you make like yourself
and flee?

302
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,961
I got it now.
Maybe I'm gonna buy it.

303
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,754
-[grunts]
-Five dollars.

304
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,966
[gasps] Oh, my God!

305
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,592
Sadie, you can sell anything,

306
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,720
if you just sell people the idea
that they're not being sold to.

307
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,056
Wow!
That's pretty manipulative.

308
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,642
But I didn't need to
because your clothing sells itself.

309
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,644
Hey, I guess you're right.

310
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,229
[groans] My back aches.

311
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,939
-I gotta sit down.
-Oh!

312
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,692
-Here.
-[bear growls]

313
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,193
Smart move adopting.

314
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,404
Let someone else do all the work, right?
[chuckles]

315
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,281
Girl, you do not wanna be pregnant.

316
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,578
Ugh! What am I gonna do?

317
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,037
My life's over.

318
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,748
No! Are you kidding?
This is a good thing.

319
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,210
-That boy's stuck with you, now.
-Stuck with me?

320
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,838
No, good stuck,
like when you try on

321
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,048
your friend's fancy ring
and it won't come off.

322
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,508
Now you got a free ring.

323
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,844
You know, Evelyn still expects you
to give that ring back.

324
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,512
That sounds like an Evelyn problem.

325
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,850
Meanwhile, that little white roulette ball
just landed on your number.

326
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,019
You know the Wallaces are good people.

327
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,563
-They're gonna do right by you.
-[sobbing]

328
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,856
No, don't cry. Look.

329
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,358
They're gonna have you move
into the big house,

330
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,319
probably in the big room.

331
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,696
You know, the one with all the dolls.

332
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,490
And I'll be right up here
whenever you need me.

333
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,660
Hey, I wanna give you this.

334
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,079
Did you steal this from Evelyn, too?

335
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:18,709
Your... grammy gave me this necklace
when I first got pregnant.

336
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,420
It's been in our family for generations.

337
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,255
It's from the old country.

338
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,465
And when you wear this,

339
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,594
I want you to remember that you've come
from a long line of women,

340
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:32,514
who've taken our licks,
but we always land on our feet.

341
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,768
-Don't we?
-[grunts]

342
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,895
Now listen to me. This is our shot.

343
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,148
-Don't blow it, okay?
-[sniffles] Okay.

344
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:42,983
[Sadie] <i>Princess Carolyn?</i>

345
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,904
-Yeah.
-Would you want to meet my family?

346
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,323
-Of course.
-There's a potluck at the church, tonight.

347
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:53,452
-I love a church potluck!
-Oh! What church do you go to in LA?

348
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:58,457
Oh, uh, St. Mary's Good Shepherd
of the Lady... of the Passion...

349
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,963
of the Constant Gardener...
of Latter-Day Belle and Sebastian.

350
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,715
You got time for that, but you can't say
"California Pizza Kitchen"?

351
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,801
I love church and I love the Lord.

352
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,302
God is my back-door pilot.

353
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,346
I wish Strib was a back-door pilot.

354
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,723
Maybe then I wouldn't be pregnant.
[chuckles]

355
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,433
-[whispers] Anal sex.
-Got it.

356
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,270
[chatter]

357
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,982
That's my mom. That woman's been banged
more times than a screen door

358
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,191
during hurricane season.

359
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,609
-Oh!
-But I love her.

360
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,902
That's my sister Tanya.

361
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,153
Thinks she's so smart.

362
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,613
If you're so smart, Tanya,

363
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,699
why do you live
on a dry-docked pontoon boat?

364
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,826
-Good one!
-She's got a great heart.

365
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,036
And, finally, the cousins.
I've slept with all of them.

366
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,121
-Wow!
-I'm just kidding.

367
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,456
-I'm from North Carolina, not Tennessee.
-[laughing]

368
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,836
Hope you like ambrosia, since everyone
brought the exact same dish; ambrosia.

369
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,379
Ah, it's beautiful out here.

370
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,339
Look at all those stars!

371
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,175
-You don't have stars in LA?
-Not like these.

372
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,635
Too much light pollution.

373
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,012
And heavy pollution.

374
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,351
[Princess Carolyn shivering]

375
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,898
[sighs]
My dad's ready to see you.

376
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,483
[sighs]

377
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,527
-We better not.
-[groans]

378
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,698
[Mr. Wallace clearing throat]

379
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,162
Oh, I gotta tell you, when my idiot son
told me he'd knocked up the help, I...

380
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,205
Let me try that again.

381
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,417
Princess Carolyn,
we're going to do the right thing, here.

382
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,919
You'll have a lovely wedding
before you start to show.

383
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,255
If it's a girl, we'll name her Dorothy
after my mother.

384
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,717
Of course, if it's a boy, he'll be
the third Cooper Thomas Rogers Wallace,

385
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,637
so you'll call him Cooper III,
or Cooper Three, Trip, Trey or Lil' Coop.

386
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,223
You'll join the Junior League,
maybe sing in the Follies.

387
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,100
Mrs. Wallace will teach you
how to play bridge

388
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,228
and destroy other families' social status
through indelicate gossip.

389
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,064
-Oh...
-We'll go to Hilton Head every summer

390
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,983
and take a photo of all of us on the beach
wearing khaki and white.

391
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,443
This will be our Christmas card.

392
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,613
Inside, it will say "Merry Merry"
or "Seasons Greetings,"

393
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,948
so as not to alienate our friends
of other faiths,

394
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,575
but we'll know it's Christmas.

395
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,078
Princess Carolyn, I know you're scared,

396
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,164
but I promise you,
you've got a great life ahead of you.

397
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,584
No worries, no tough choices
and no money troubles,

398
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,921
thanks to the Wallace and Sons
Answering Machine Tape empire.

399
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:13,092
Yes, as long as people need answering
machine tapes, you will be taken care of.

400
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,676
-Sound good?
-Yes.

401
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,929
Ah, ah, ah. Wait for the beep.

402
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,056
Sound good? Beep!

403
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,767
-Yes, sir.
-[phone buzzing, meowing]

404
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,977
[back to present time] Hello?

405
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,146
Princess Carolyn,
there's been an accident.

406
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,940
BoJack's hurt real bad.

407
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,067
Ow! I'm in so much pain.

408
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,027
I'm like Kerri Strug over here.

409
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,113
Where's my big Russian guy?

410
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,114
What happened?

411
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,783
-<i>He fell off a building is what happened.</i>
-Oh!

412
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,700
Are you okay?

413
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,871
I mean, I know you're not<i> okay, okay,</i>
but you're<i> okay,</i> right?

414
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,873
Why did you let him do his own stunts?

415
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,334
-That was today?
-Of course it was today.

416
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,379
I put a sticky on your day page
at our sister site

417
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,548
WhatDateIsItRightNow.net.

418
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,676
-Oh!
<i>-Do you even check your day page?</i>

419
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,428
Every part of me hurts.
Sartre was wrong.

420
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,224
Physical pain is so much worse
than prolonged emotional distress.

421
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,184
What a hack!

422
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,688
We're supposed to be shooting, all week.
You're behind schedule and over budget.

423
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,606
I'm sending you the number
of a specialist.

424
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,401
He can fix BoJack up
and inject him full of enough pep

425
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,361
to keep things together
until end of production.

426
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,572
-Sadie!
-[mother] No, no, no, no, Strib!

427
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,781
[sister] Go away!

428
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,491
<i>-So I call this number--</i>
-[phone beeps]

429
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,201
Strib, what are you doing here?

430
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,538
I mean, I guess I was wrong, maybe.
Maybe you don't give the baby away.

431
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,332
Like, maybe keep it.
I mean, I guess I could marry you.

432
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,293
Have a family and stuff. I don't know!

433
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,712
A grand gesture?
This is like a fairy tale!

434
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,505
Strib, I can't do this again.

435
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,634
-Come on. I love you or whatever.
-Go to him, Sadie. He loves you.

436
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,137
Don't listen to her, Sadie.
She lives in a pontoon boat.

437
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,723
Y'all gonna be beggin' for a ride
when the flood comes.

438
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,392
-Oh, my God.
-Somebody gotta get him outta here.

439
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,896
-[people arguing]
-Hey! Sadie? Sadie.

440
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,647
[voices overlapping]

441
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,321
You blew it!
We were this close, and you blew it.

442
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,865
-[sighs] Mom.
-What the hell happened?

443
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,744
You eat a pineapple or something?
Put something up there you shouldn't have?

444
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,413
No. It just--
I don't know, it just happened.

445
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,209
Miscarriages don't "just happen."
This was our ticket.

446
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,961
That baby would've changed
everything for us.

447
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,632
[sobs] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

448
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,092
[sighs] It's not your fault.

449
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,221
We just got losing numbers.

450
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,681
Well, maybe Cooper will marry me, anyway?

451
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,644
Oh, sweetie, you've been watching
too many of those old movies.

452
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,188
Coopers don't marry gals like you.

453
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:35,859
He's gonna end up with some fancy heiress,
like Samantha Floppy-Disk.

454
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,570
Besides, you don't want that life.

455
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,573
-You're free now.
-Free to do what?

456
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:46,286
I wasn't gonna tell you,
but this came in the mail.

457
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,204
[gasps]

458
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,710
[phone buzzing, meowing]

459
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,380
-Hello?
-I guess you heard about BoJack?

460
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,590
-Yeah.
-This is all my fault.

461
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,550
I thought the stunt was Flip's idea.

462
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,345
Well, no, I just convinced him
it was his idea.

463
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,015
That's not what I heard.
I heard it was Flip's idea.

464
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,017
-Right, but that's just--
-It was Flip's idea.

465
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,227
How are you not getting this?

466
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,354
Do you only seem smart
because you wear glasses?

467
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,857
[sighs] Okay, it was Flip's idea.

468
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,276
Great. I'll see you tomorrow.

469
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,902
-Hey.
-Hey.

470
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,407
Listen, I've known me some Stribs.
A little sweet, a little dangerous.

471
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,826
But the second things get complicated,
he'll run away.

472
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,037
-You don't know my Strib.
-But I know you. And you are too special

473
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,415
to settle for the first guy
who rolls up on a motorcycle

474
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,292
and says, [drawls]
"I love you or whatever."

475
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,295
Well, I haven't decided
what I'm gonna do yet anyway.

476
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,964
You're a bright girl,
and you've got an incredible future.

477
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,217
Let me ask you something.
Did you really like the clothes I made?

478
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,468
Of course I did.

479
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,971
Then why didn't you buy anything
for yourself?

480
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,181
-Sadie...
-You're bullshitting me.

481
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,350
-This is just another sale for you.
-No.

482
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,395
You think I'm stupid,
but I've been watching you bullshit,

483
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,813
everyone on that phone of yours.

484
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:58,400
I want to give your baby the best life,
the best schools, the best opportunities--

485
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,319
You think, because you left her,
you're better.

486
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,113
Because of your fancy show business,
you can take whatever you want.

487
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,616
-No, no, no, you don't understand.
-Well, I got something you can't have,

488
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,037
and no amount of your managing
or producing is gonna change that.

489
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,415
I just want to help you.
I want to give your baby a better life.

490
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,292
Better than what?

491
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,170
Better than a sky fulla stars?

492
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,963
[sighs]

493
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,259
[deep breath] Okay, Sadie,
you do whatever you want.

494
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,428
You want to keep the baby,

495
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,847
you want to give the baby
to someone else, fine.

496
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,766
Just do, what <i>you </i>want to do.

497
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,811
Don't live your life for Strib,
or this baby, or anybody else.

498
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,898
-I know that.
-Okay. Good.

499
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,318
-Thank you.
-I mean it.

-[phone buzzing, meowing]
-Hello?

502
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,914
So, I just got the word from Sadie.

503
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,209
<i>-She's gonna keep looking.</i>
-Okay.

504
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,670
Ugh! I'm sorry.
This is the hardest part of my job,

505
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,465
<i>when I have to lie to the clients</i>
<i>and tell them it's not their fault.</i>

506
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,635
-Thank you, Tracy.
-It's not your fault.

507
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,136
-Goodbye, Tracy.

[phone buzzing, meowing]

511
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,485
BoJack, I am so sorry.
This was all my fault.

512
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,446
Uh, it's your fault I feel amazing?

513
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,240
I don't know what that doctor gave me,

514
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:32,119
but, man, you should leave town
more often.

515
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,579
Hey, quick question... is this a train?

516
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,622
I'm on my way home.

517
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,749
I'll come check on you
as soon as I get there.

518
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,709
Hey, I'm golden. Let me tell you.

519
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,087
You accidentally drive a motorcycle
off a building,

520
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,714
and suddenly
you are everybody's favorite guy.

521
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,592
We did it, Princess Carolyn. Back on top!

-[mom grunts]

525
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,232
Okay. Bye, Mom. Ooh!

526
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,861
Hey, I got a nutty idea.
What if you deferred for a year?

527
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,779
Mom, I-I can't do that.

528
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,783
Of course you could.
Los Angeles isn't going nowhere.

529
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,076
Just another year.

530
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,038
By that time, Boots will be out of rehab,
and he can come home, and help out.

531
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,791
-Just wait until then.
-Mom, please.

532
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,043
A year. You'll hardly notice it.

533
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,297
-No, Mom. I gotta go.
-Please?

534
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,633
Can't you just do this one thing for me?

535
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,178
I'm sorry, Mom.
