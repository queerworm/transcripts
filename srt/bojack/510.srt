164
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,964
-[camera shutters clicking]
-[reporters clamoring]

165
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,009
Hey, BoJack, can we get some of just you?

166
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,678
-Oh, uh, yeah.
-Mm-hmm. I'll see you in there.

167
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,474
FYI, you're gonna want pictures of her
after you see what she does in <i>Philbert.</i>

168
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,061
Let me tell you something,
that 39-year-old actress is going places.

169
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,688
-Oh. Hey.
-What happened to your arm?

170
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:47,693
-Oh, just some asshole got T-boned by me.
-Oh, my God. When?

171
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:52,031
Uh... couple weeks ago? Or months?

172
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,284
As Philbert says, "Time is like a woman;

173
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,578
completely impossible to comprehend."

174
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,163
I think we ended up cutting that line

175
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,374
because the network was worried
it would be offensive

176
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,584
to people who didn't know
what time it was.

177
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,087
-[clattering]
-This you call a tip?

178
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,756
I haven't seen a tip this measly
since my bris.

179
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,510
You must be Ziggy Abler.
Oh, thank you so much for coming.

180
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,178
Darling, you're wasting your time.

181
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,765
I love to sign documents.
In fact, that's my signature move.

182
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,684
But if Abel signed it, I won't.

183
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,103
I guess you could say I'm willing,
but not Abel!

184
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,063
-Oh...!
-Now where are those tiny tacos?

185
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,022
Oh!

186
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,942
-[bell chimes]
-Cuckoo.

187
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,863
[Henry] <i>Chicka-chicka, oh, yeah.</i>

188
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,907
<i>Mmm-ch, mmm-ch!</i>

189
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,784
[clattering]

190
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,537
Oh, is it five o'clock already?

191
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,747
If you've poured me a drink,
you must want something.

192
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,166
-Out with it.
-[Henry] <i>I want to be on top of you.</i>

193
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,503
There's no one on top of me.
I'm CEO of this company.

194
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,424
<i>-That's my favorite position.</i>
-Well, you can't have it. It's mine.

195
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,925
<i>Give it to me.</i>

196
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,761
You want to be tantamount
to this catamount?

197
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,058
You've got balls, I'll give you that.

198
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,811
[clanking, whirring] <i>I am a horny robot.</i>

199
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,689
For my job, yes, you've been quite clear.

200
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,066
But if you were CEO, what would I do?

201
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,819
Take a portraiture class
at the Learning Annex?

202
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:16,282
While away the hours,
painting canvas after canvas of my wife,

203
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,325
and, through this act,

204
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,911
rediscover the woman I fell in love with
those many years ago?

205
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,582
No, such a realization would only crush
my too-feeble heart.

206
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,711
After all, what benefit is it to love
without the words to express it?

207
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,840
What could I possibly say to articulate
my deep devotion to this woman,

208
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,176
who has become but a stranger to me now?

209
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:40,264
[whirring] <i>I am powerless in the face</i>
<i>of your mesmerizing sexual energy.</i>

210
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:45,102
[gasps] Such a brain for business,
yet such a tongue for poetry.

211
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,899
So, I am resigning from my post,
effective immediately.

212
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,943
I leave you in the good hands
of Henry Fondle.

213
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,906
-Henry, would you like to say a few words?
-Henry] <i>You will submit to my desires.</i>

214
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,492
-Very impressive.
-He's leaning in and I respect that.

215
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:04,914
-Uh... guys, are you sure about this?
-I've never been more sure about anything.

216
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,416
Todd, why don't you show your new boss
around the premises?

217
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,419
I'm actually about to head out
to the <i>Philbert</i> premiere party.

218
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,130
-[Henry] <i>I'm coming.</i>
-Brilliant! You'll take him with you!

219
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,383
Oh, no, no.
He doesn't need to come.

220
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,427
[Henry] <i>I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>
<i>Oh, God, I'm coming.</i>

221
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,930
Whatever you say... boss.

222
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,264
[splattering]

223
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,183
Hello, everyone.

224
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,644
Thank you for attending the premiere
of my opus.

225
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,480
I hope you all enjoy it
because that means you are smart.

226
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,692
If you don't get it, that means
that my genius wasn't appreciated

227
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,819
in my own time, and that's okay, too.

228
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,153
[weak laughter]

229
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,198
Why are you laughing?
Please do not laugh during the screening.

230
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,409
This episode contains
no intentional humor.

231
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,495
[chuckles] Okay. That's--
that's always a good sign,

232
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,790
when you have to clarify that.
Look, folks, Herb is being modest.

233
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,999
-"Herb"?
-I'm sorry.

234
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,336
[laughs] Flip. Did I say Herb?

235
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,424
Herb is being modest,
but he put together a tremendous show

236
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,384
that I think that you guys
are really gonna love.

237
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,886
That's right.
It all came out of this brain.

238
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:05,099
-Ha! That brain, he says?
-That brain? Double-ha!

239
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,016
Shh!

240
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,436
And the most amazing thing about this show

241
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,397
is that I'm sure we all have Philberts
in our lives,

242
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,982
or we are Philberts.

243
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,777
You know, we've all done terrible things
that we deeply regret.

244
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,905
I've done so many... unforgivable things.

245
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,283
And I think that,
that's what this show says.

246
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:26,996
Is that... is that we're all terrible,
so therefore we're all... okay.

247
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:27,913
What?

248
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,000
And I think
that's a really powerful message.

249
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,253
Okay, well, without further ado,
the first chapter,

250
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,338
and notice I said "chapter" not episode

251
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,092
because I think of this show as more
of a novel than a TV show...

252
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,428
-of <i>Philbert!</i>
-[applause]

253
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,308
[BoJack's voice]
<i>Nothing's lonelier than a party.</i>

254
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,187
[cheering, applause]

255
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,856
Barf me a river!

256
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,649
[camera shutter clicks]

257
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,777
[phone clicking]

258
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,864
Hey, Pickles, where have you been?
You left after, like, ten minutes.

259
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,157
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,452
My friend Ilana, not my best friend Ilana,
but another Ilana who is my friend,

261
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,455
was having a crisis,
and I needed to text her "LOL."

262
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,040
Well, you missed the whole episode.

263
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,126
I saw the first ten minutes!
I just couldn't get into it.

264
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,419
And you kept saying,

265
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,088
"Do you love it? Are you loving it?
How did you like that scene?"

266
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,217
Well, did you love it? Were you loving it?
How did you like that scene?

267
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,427
Every time you showed up on screen,
I kept thinking,

268
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,430
"That's not a dirty cop,
that's my boyfriend!

269
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,099
The sweetest, cutest dog
in the whole world!"

270
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,685
And then you'd shoot someone,
and I was like... eww!

271
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,146
-Fritz is the hardest I've ever acted.
-Oh.

272
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,981
Harder than the ice bucket challenge,

273
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,108
but it was fake ice.
I wanted you to see it.

274
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,569
I'm going to fix this.
You stay here and party.

275
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,155
I'll go home.
I'll watch the entire season of your show.

276
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,657
You don't have to do that.

277
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,203
And you don't have to like every one
of my Instagram posts, but you do.

278
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,539
The least I could do
is watch your TV show,

279
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:55,000
even if it kills me
because I hate it so much.

280
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,629
-Well, don't watch it if you hate it.
-I'm going to do this for us.

281
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,381
-But--
-I love you!

282
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,508
-[sighs]
-[buzzing]

283
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,428
I've been to dozens of these things
and I've never heard applause like that.

284
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,888
We might actually get a season two.

285
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,099
-That's never happened to me before.
-That's incredible.

286
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,185
Excuse me,
can I borrow you for a few minutes?

287
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,604
-Oh, sure. Gina, do you mind if I, um...?
-Yeah, go ahead.

288
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,399
Oh, no, I was actually talking to Gina.

289
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,776
Me? I'm being borrowed for a few minutes?

290
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,320
Oh! Well, yeah. Yeah, of course.
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

291
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,072
Wow. Oh, my God.

292
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,533
Hey, how you doing? Hey, you came!

293
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,327
Flip, I screwed up.
I didn't know it would feel like that.

294
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,789
To be in that room.
To hear people cheering <i>for Philbert!</i>

295
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,667
-What are you talking about?
-When I first started on this job,

296
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,711
I wanted to make <i>Philbert</i>
more well-rounded,

297
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,504
so the audience
could relate to him better.

298
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,839
And now you're upset

299
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,508
because I didn't mention you
in my introduction.

300
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:48,679
Diane, the whole point of television
is it's a collaborative medium,

301
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,932
-where one person gets all the credit.
-No, it's not about that.

302
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,269
I made him more vulnerable,
and that made him more likable,

303
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,062
which makes for a better TV show.

304
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,190
But if <i>Philbert</i> is just a way
to help dumb assholes<i> </i>rationalize

305
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,442
their own awful behavior,

306
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,320
well, I'm sorry,
but we can't put this out there.

307
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,696
Uh, it's out there.

308
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,449
The whole season's dropping at midnight
all over the world.

309
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,576
-I can't be here.
-[Flip sighs]

310
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,412
Come on, fellas.
I know we can find a solution here.

311
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,330
I doubt it.

312
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,916
We have the same problem
as a hematology lab

313
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,209
that goes a week without electricity!

314
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,961
Too much bad blood!

315
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,340
But you obviously work together so well.
What went wrong?

316
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,175
It was a long time ago.

317
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,011
My wife Harriet
always had a sneaker for Ziggy.

318
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,388
Oh, and the unspoken resentment crept in?

319
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,599
Unspoken? It was shouted!

320
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,769
Nevertheless, me and Harriet ended up
having a fling.

321
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,103
Eventually, we got married.

322
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,773
-And that killed the partnership?
-No, we got over that.

323
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,776
But at their tenth anniversary,
I had a few too many--

324
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,402
And what, you took a swing at him?

325
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,988
I said I always felt
he had the easier job,

326
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,531
coming up with the punch lines.

327
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,241
And then what? What led to the rift?

328
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,371
Led? That's the whole rift!
He besmirched my craft.

329
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,373
I still haven't forgiven
the son of a bitch!

330
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,418
I said it then, and I stand by it now!

331
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,921
All the pressure's on the punch line!

332
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,422
Pressure? Please!

333
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:09,134
Set-ups need context,
mise-en-scène, flavor!

334
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,930
I carried us to the top
of the Popsicle stick game!

335
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,766
You wrote the part
they let you try before you buy!

336
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,559
I had to deliver the money line!

337
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,644
[both] Ugh!

338
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,021
So, you both think you had the harder job?

339
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,314
-[Abel] Of course!
-Indubitably!

340
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,525
Well, what if you tried switching roles?

341
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,695
-You mean, I tag <i>his </i>set-ups?
-Why not?

342
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,823
I don't know.
I'm a punch line guy my whole life.

343
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,158
How do I come up with straight lines?

344
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,745
-You could try using a ruler.
-Oh!

345
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,247
[both laugh]

346
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,750
-Oh, I missed you, Abel!
-You, too, Zig!

347
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,752
All right, so we have a deal?

348
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,464
What did the terminally ill man say
to Dr. Kevorkian?

349
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,967
"Give me that sweet release!"

350
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,221
Hey.

351
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,182
Did you really mean what you said,
before the screening?

352
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,686
About how Philbert made you feel okay,
about yourself?

353
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,687
Oh, I don't know--

354
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,023
Because, you know,
that's not the point of Philbert--

355
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,150
for guys to watch it and feel okay.

356
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,652
Diane, it's a compliment.
You did a good job. Relax.

357
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,362
I don't want you, or anyone else,

358
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,823
justifying their shitty behavior
because of the show.

359
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:13,824
What is your problem?

360
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,118
Why can't you accept
that something you did is successful?

361
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,120
It's connecting to people,
and that's good.

362
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,664
You're right, sorry.
I don't know why I thought you would care.

363
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,459
-Excuse me?
-What is going on with you? You're a mess.

364
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,962
-Am I?
-I feel like I barely know you anymore.

365
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,464
Oh, bullshit. Don't give me that.

366
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,633
-It's true. I don't know you.
-No. You know me. You do.

367
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,510
Then what the hell happened in New Mexico?

368
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,554
Look, I...

369
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,306
I don't know what you think
that you know--

370
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,432
I don't know anything!

371
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,852
I mean, I know something happened
with a girl in New Mexico,

372
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,104
and I know it resulted in
you coming home in a boat.

373
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,439
-Well, that's--
-I also know...

374
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,566
that your old friend Charlotte
lives in New Mexico

375
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,194
because you used to leave
her business card lying around the house,

376
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,780
and I know her daughter is a senior
at Oberlin.

377
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,782
-How--?
-And I know you went to Oberlin

378
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,200
during your bender three years ago

379
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,744
because a bunch of students
posted pictures of you on Facebook.

380
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,288
Jesus Christ,
why are you so obsessed with me?

381
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,915
I am not obsessed.

382
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,209
I wanted to know what happened,
and you wouldn't tell me.

383
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,920
-You never asked!
-Okay, so I'm asking now.

384
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,214
What happened in New Mexico?

385
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,842
-Hallo! Smile for Yahoo, Finland!
-[camera shutter clicks]

386
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,469
What I don't understand is why you feel

387
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,055
like you deserve to know
every shitty thing I ever did.

388
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,473
I don't deserve anything.

389
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,184
I would like to know
when you've done shitty things.

390
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,268
Why is that your business?

391
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,355
Because I'm your friend,
and I care about you,

392
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,607
and I wrote a book about you,

393
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,277
and now I wrote this show for you,
and I am very publicly your friend,

394
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,781
so if it gets out that you're doing
creepy stuff, that makes me look bad.

395
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,367
Oh! So you're worried about things
that I may have done

396
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,328
because you think
that it reflects badly on <i>you?</i>

397
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,539
Hurts your brand?
That's your moral high ground?

398
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,374
This is not about "moral high ground."

399
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,583
Wanna know about New Mexico?

400
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,461
You want to know about the one
little thing that I did in New Mexico,

401
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,296
which, by the way,
wasn't even really a thing?

402
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,549
-You know what? Spare me.
-No, I'm gonna tell you.

403
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,800
I'll tell you what you want.

404
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,886
And while I'm at it, you wanna hear about
what happened at the MTV beach house?

405
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,680
Or why I'm not allowed
to fly United anymore?

406
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,266
Or what happened with Sharona,
the makeup lady on <i>Horsing Around?</i>

407
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,601
-What?
-Or the dozens of other shady things

408
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,604
that may or may not have occurred
in my life that I can barely even remember

409
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,065
'cause I was high or drunk
or it was 30 years ago?

410
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,317
And you don't feel bad,
about any of this stuff?

411
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,529
Yeah, of course I do!
I've spent so much time feeling bad.

412
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:19,074
By the way, most of these women...
don't even remember, I bet.

413
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,951
Well, that's really convenient for you.

414
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,786
I'm the one
who has to live with this shit.

415
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,581
I'm the one who has to feel the guilt
all day, every day.

416
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,416
So, you're the victim here?

417
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,710
Yeah, and I know
that's not the woke, progressive,

418
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,963
intersectionally appropriate thing to say,
but I would say, yeah!

419
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,175
I'm the one who has suffered the most
because of the actions of BoJack Horseman.

420
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,926
<i>-You've </i>suffered?
-Yeah, I have!

421
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,636
<i>-The most?</i>
<i>-The most!</i>

422
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,098
Really? More than, say, Sarah Lynn?

423
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,975
Don't talk to me about her.

424
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,021
No, I wanna know how <i>you're </i>the victim
of the Sarah Lynn story.

425
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,439
-I'm serious.
-Explain to me...

426
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,775
how Sarah Lynn's overdose was
really rough for you.

427
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,694
-Shut up.
-You feel a lot of guilt about that?

428
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,072
You feel a lot of guilt because you were
the only father figure she ever had,

429
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,908
and when she came to you for help, you--

430
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,076
-Hey, how you doing?
-You folks having a good time?

431
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,870
You look great. Thanks for coming.

432
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,914
-You had sex with her?
-That's-- ! No.

433
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,542
And then when she was sober,
you took her on a month-long bender?

434
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,755
And then she died. And she is dead now.
And you're still alive.

435
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,549
With a girlfriend, who is also alive,
and a TV show.

436
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,720
And that's been really hard for <i>you,</i>
the main character in this story.

437
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,181
Why are you bringing this shit up?
Is this fun for you?

438
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,933
-To really rub in--
-It's not <i>fun.</i>

439
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,644
You win! You scored all the points
in the argument!

440
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,231
According to facts, you are right
and I am wrong, like always.

441
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,275
But you know what? I don't care.
Because I'm trying to move forward.

442
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,693
You haven't changed at all.

443
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,738
Yes! Congratulations!
You are the last person to get that.

444
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,867
I'm not gonna <i>change.</i>
I don't need your <i>help</i> for <i>changing,</i>

445
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,827
so you can stop trying
to make me your project.

446
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,996
-That's not--
-When I met you, I was depressed

447
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,498
because I didn't like myself.

448
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,501
And when you wrote that book
and sold a bajillion copies,

449
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,004
you taught me that as screwed up
as I am, that's okay.

450
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,132
<i>You </i>did that. And now I'm okay.

451
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,134
I don't believe that's true.

452
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,554
And I don't think you believe it's true.

453
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:08,058
I think you want me to tell you
that you can be better.

454
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:12,271
And even though you're being
a total asshole right now,

455
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,730
I still believe it.

456
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,482
If all you've gotten
out of this friendship,

457
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:19,027
is the idea that you should be okay
with yourself, as you are,

458
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,655
then I don't think
this is a good relationship...

459
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,739
for either of us.

460
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,449
-Diane, come on.
-I'm going home.

461
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,328
No, Diane, we're saying things,
but let's just go back to the party.

462
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,330
I'm done... with all of this.

463
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,457
I went to New Mexico to see Charlotte.

464
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,127
She was married with a daughter.

465
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,962
But it wasn't like...
what you're thinking.

466
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,965
She was 17, which is the legal age
of consent in New Mexico,

467
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,427
and she wasn't drunk, so,
not that I wanted to, I never... I didn't.

468
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,221
That's the dumbest part of all of this!
I didn't do anything.

469
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,849
I mean, the fact that this has turned
into such a thing for you--

470
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,643
you know, maybe I didn't tell you
because there was nothing to tell.

471
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,979
Did you ever think of that?
She was my friend's daughter,

472
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,106
and she wanted it, and I was... [breathes]

473
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,775
I was in a bad place
because Charlotte had just--

474
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,570
So, then she came onto my boat,
Charlotte, I mean,

475
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,572
and she walked in,
and I was with her daughter.

476
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,490
But again, nothing had happened yet.

477
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,784
-"Yet?"
-Nothing happened.

478
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,161
Goodbye, BoJack.

479
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,329
-Diane, no!
-Hey-- Aah!

480
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,664
You wanted me to tell you. I told you.
You know everything.

481
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,624
-Please let go of me.
-Diane, please.

482
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,419
You're hurting me,
and I would like you to let go now.

483
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,713
[winces, sighs]

484
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,006

[whirring]

488
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,317
-So, what'd you think of the show, boss?
-[Henry] <i>More, more.</i>

489
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,152
Well, all ten episodes

490
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,821
-will be on our website at midnight.
<i>-More.</i>

491
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,283
-You want more episodes?
<i>-Give it to me.</i>

492
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,913
Ooh! Flip! They're picking us up
for more episodes!

493
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,792
Wow. And my mother said
I'd never last as long as <i>Hung.</i>

494
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,710
Well, who's <i>Hung </i>now, Mom?

495
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,878
Uh, right.

496
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,049
[puffs] Ugh.

497
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,927
[grunts] Ow! Oh, ah!

Uh...

00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,144
-Oh. Hey!
-Hey.

501
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,605
-You're leaving?
-Yeah. You?

502
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,065
I'm just getting some air.

503
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,984
No, wrong Prius.
I'm sorry I lost my ticket!

504

-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

505
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,446
Want me to drive you home?

506
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,198
You can come back
and get your car tomorrow?

507
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,491
You don't have to do that.

508
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,785
Of course not.
I don't have to do anything.

510
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,541
Gina, I know it's early,

511
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,168
but have you started writing
your acceptance speech for the Emmys?

512
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,672
Oh, stop. I'll probably just repurpose
whatever I say at the SAG Awards.

513
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,298
-[laughter]
-Is that gonna read as cocky?

514
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,802
Can you explain to your readers
that I'm being charmingly self-effacing?

515
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,471
-Excuse me.
-Oh, hey, hot stuff! Whoa!

[Gina moans]

518
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,901
Thanks.

519
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,947
And, great job, by the way.
You're really good on the show.

520
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,617
Yeah? No. Me? No. Yeah?

521
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,913
Yeah! You're a good actor.
I never knew that about you.

522
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,707
Well, I'll see you back on set, right?

523
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,625
Did you hear we got picked up
for more episodes?

524
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,335
I'm not going back.

525
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,088
Oh. Well, then,
I guess I'll see you around.

526
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,632
I hope so. [chuckles]

527
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,719
I can't believe I finally got you
to leave a party early.

528
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,305
Come on, you know I'd do anything for you.

529
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:37,934
-Why? I'm such a disaster.
-You're not a disaster.

530
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,312
You're Diane. You're amazing.

531
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,860
Do you wanna come in?

532
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,989
