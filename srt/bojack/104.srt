172
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,393
I've asked him to get a job,
I've asked him to move out.

173
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,685
With a little encouragement,

174
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,312
I'll bet he could
really flourish.

175
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,813
I mean, didn't you have anyone
who helped you

176
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:19,940
when you were just
starting out?

177
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,358
Um, actually, no.

178
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,318
Todd clearly thinks
the world of you.

179
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,153
Todd thinks the world
of Pop-Tarts.

180
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,198
Look, I get that helping other
people is not your thing, but--

181
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,617
What? I let Todd live
rent-free in my stately manse.

182
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,535
I am his own personal
Mother Teresa.

183
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,704
But do you let him stay here
because you're kind

184
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,664
or just because you're terrified
of being alone?

185
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,625
[laughing]
That is insane!

186
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,129
I would love to be alone.
That is all I want.

187
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,131
Mmm...if that were
really true,

188
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,091
I don't think you'd be clipping
Todd's wings all the time.

189
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,634
What? That's unbelievable.

190
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,885
Todd!

191
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,387
What?
Clean up my shit?

192
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,514
Yes, but also,
I would like to...

193
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,475
help you with your
dumb-ass rock opera.

194
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,313
- What?
- I am... supporting you.

195
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,274
I-I don't understand.
Oh, my God, are you dying?

196
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:06,278
No. I... think you have great
depth of untapped potential

197
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,530
and I wish to mentor you
in your... art.

198
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,283
- Really?
- Yes.

199
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,743
Wait, is this going to be
like that time

200
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,203
you promised to take me
ice skating,

201
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,164
and I got really excited
about the ice skating,

202
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,207
but then instead of ice skating,
you left me at home

203
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,625
so you could go
to the strip club

204
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,836
and then you took the strippers
ice skating?

205
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,046
- No.
- Then hooray!

206
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,926
Let's dig in.
Where to start?

207
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,970
Okay, well, the headline is,
I hate it.

208
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,554
I hate everything about it.

209
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,598
The premise is bad
and the execution is also bad.

210
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,684
It's an irredeemable jumble
of shit.

211
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,935
Tough but fair.

212
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,187
Ahem.

213
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,105
That said,
I don't see why

214
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,024
we can't make something
really great here.

215
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,567
Okay, thank you.
I'll work on that.

216
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,903

Are you close?

217
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,155
No!

218
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,365
- How 'bout now?
- No!

219
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,699
Now?

220
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,908
You're not even
inside of me.

221
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,411
Oh, God!

222
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,787

- No.

228
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,549
Well, what if we move that
to the fourth act?

229
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,842
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

230
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,344
but that idea is terrible.

231
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,429

How can I put this?

237

Imagine if the Holocaust
happened

I would rather that happened
than your rock opera.

240
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,702
That's not really a note.

241
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,663
In fact, none of your notes
have been notes.

not even listening.

Yeah, well, you know what?
Maybe I would listen

244
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,877
if the Turbidians
had some reason

245
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,504
to enter
the Cave of Swollen Dreams

246
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,339

You have been listening.

249
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,468
Just doesn't make sense.

250
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,136
The Turbidians
are a loyal people.

251
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,472
They-- they wouldn't
betray their queen.

252

so they could bring
the secret knowledge

from the cave back to her,
and then establish Newtopia

to the restaurant,

278

you texted me to tell me
you weren't coming

because you were at a strip club
"eating stripper" for lunch,

Decapathon.

going to Robert Downey.

- Junior?
- If it was Junior,

destroyed my life.

threw me out of the house.

anymore, Todd.

Clearly,
Van Cleef has shown

526
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,766
a rare lapse in taste

I apologize for wasting your

Todd may not be ready

No, of course you don't.
Maybe Todd's worse off today,

to everyone that you shouldn't
be with Mr. Peanutbutter.
