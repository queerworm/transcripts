00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,276
Sarah Lynn is very tired.

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,446
Can you just tell her BoJack's here?
Horseman. I'm an old friend.

8
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,781
Well, I'll tell her, but...

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,616
[groaning]

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,078
[Sarah Lynn]
BoJack? Oh, my God! Bring him in!

11
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,206
-I can't believe you came to my concert.
-It was incredible.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,084
When you sang that one ballad
and shot fireworks out of your boobs,

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,670
that was such a moving tribute
to gays in the military.

14
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,130
We are going out.

15
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,466
Before you go, I need you
to sign these posters.

16
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,051
It's for charity.
Doctors Without Posters.

17
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,054
Okay. BoJack, can you
hang out for a minute?

18
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,931
-Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
-Also, we have those radio records,

19
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,059
and you're doing the print ads
for Sarah Lynn's Stank,

20
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,560
the new fragrance from Kevin Kline.

21
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,937
-You mean Calvin Klein.
-Kevin Kline, BoJack.

22
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,732
He's the only man who truly
understands my fragrance.

23
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,485
I'll come back in 20 for those posters.

24
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,613
Oh, my God. Being famous is the worst.

25
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,366
-Ugh! Yeah, you're telling me.
-No, but, like, really famous.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,786
-Uh...
-How can I explain it to someone like you?

27
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,956
I feel like all my friends only like me
because I'm Sarah Lynn, you know.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,667
-Nobody cares about Sarah Lipschitz.
-Who's Sarah Lipschitz?

29
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,587
The lawyer who helped me change
my name from Sarah Helmulfarb.

30
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,505
Oof!

31
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,258
It is so great to see a real friend
who knew me before I got huge

32
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,177
and isn't just trying
to get something out of me.

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,094
Right.

34
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,180
I swear you are, like,
the only one I have left.

35
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,683
I am this close to falling off
the deep end. [laughs]

36
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,479
I know I'm smiling right now,
but the light inside me is dying.

37
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,396
Uh, what?

38
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,608
But here I am blah-blah-blah-ing
about my own boring, sexy, thrilling life.

39
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,485
What is going on with you?

40
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:54,197
Well, actually, I'm doing this new show,
<i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

41
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,117
-I don't know if you've seen it or--
-Ugh, I'm so busy with the tour.

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,869
Yeah, no, of course, no,
but it's been a lot of fun.

43
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,414
The ratings aren't great,
but we have this upcoming episode,

44
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,960
and we're looking
for a really big guest star.

45
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,088
Oh. You want me to be on your show?

46
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:15,552
Well, I just thought it would
be really fun for... the both of us.

47
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,138
You know, like the old days.

48
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,267
I have the script with me
if you want to take a look at it.

49
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,228
Um, okay. Why don't you put it
on that pile over there?

50
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,564
And I'll get to it
when I have some free time.

51
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,065
-Over here?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,818
I'd love to keep hanging out,
but these doctors need their posters,

53
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,403
and I'm already pretty exhausted.

54
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,529
You should probably go.

55
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,323
-Oh, okay.
-It's all very exhausting.

56
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,616
Thanks again for coming.

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,078

to see a... you.

58

{\an8}She's on the FBI's Most Wanted list

-That depends.

what savvy film and television viewers
have known for years.

{\an8}The boats are about to collide!
We have to do something!

102
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,980
{\an8}You know damn well,
when we took to the sky,

103
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,317
{\an8}we made a solemn oath never to meddle
in the affairs of land nor sea.

We are sworn but to observe.

{\an8}Oh, no! The boats
are tearing each other apart!

107
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,452
{\an8}Crates and crates of spaghetti
are pouring out into the ocean!

108
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,538

Oh, no!

112
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,760
The pasta is cooking!

113
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,847
If only we had some olive oil
to reduce the stickiness.

114
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,851
But olive oil doesn't actually
reduce the stickiness in pasta.

115
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,686
That's only a myth.

116
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,732
No! I've wasted so much of my life

117
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,694

-Well, Tom, as the spaghetti cooks,

125
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,093
{\an8}it will expand, smothering the town

126
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,971
{\an8}and tenderly broiling the sea life
who reside there.

127
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,514
Is there any way to prevent

128
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,684
this delicious-sounding
environmental catastrophe?

129
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,185
{\an8}The only hope for rescue would be

130
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,105
{\an8}if someone had an enormous quantity
of spaghetti strainers

131
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,523
{\an8}just sitting around the house,

132
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,901
{\an8}but that person would also need
access to a fleet of drivers

133
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,903
to transport said spaghetti strainers,

134
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,239
and in order to strain
the spaghetti fast enough,

135
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,075
the drivers would also need to be
incredibly strong swimmers,

136
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,953
like, just as an example,
hot, sexy killer whales.

137
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,622
Is there such a savior

that ridiculously specific
set of criteria?

139

on my favorite TV show, let's find out.

00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,572
Wow, that was a good movie.

164
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,492
Was it Oscar-worthy? Who's to say?

165
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,328
Ninety-eight messages?
Better listen to them all, in order.

166
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,830
[Todd] <i>Mr. Peanutbutter, call me back</i>
<i>as soon as you get this, okay?</i>

167
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,707
<i>We need your strainers.</i>
<i>This is life and death.</i>

168
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,876
-Oh, my God!
-[Todd]<i> Mr. Peanutbutter,</i>

169
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,214
<i>I'm at your house with the entire</i>
<i>Cabracadabra fleet, but we can't get in!</i>

170
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,590
<i>You need to get over here!</i>

171
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,301
<i>It's a spaghetti-strainer-related</i>
<i>emergency.</i>

172
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,555
All right, buddy, just as soon as I listen
to these other 96 messages.

173
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,890
[man] <i>Good afternoon, I'm calling</i>
<i>from Center Theater Group.</i>

174
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,725
<i>You saw a play once eight years ago.</i>

175
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,186
<i>I wonder if I could interest you</i>
<i>in a full season subscription--</i>

176
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,980
Oh, I don't have time for this!
[grunts]

[rock music playing]

178
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,024
If we don't get some kind of miracle--

179
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,110
Wait! In the distance! Is that--?

180
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,028
No, it can't be!

181
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,951
Spaghetti or not, here I come.

182
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,622
[studio audience laughing]

183
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,707
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

184
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,960
Sabrina, I'm coming down
for my birthday surprise!

185
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,378
Oh, no!

186
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,923
Well, I've heard of
pasta point of no return,

187
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,050
<i>but this is ridiculous!</i>

188
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,469
-[studio audience laughing]
-[groans]

189
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,598
<i>Why didn't you just tell me</i>
<i>you made too much spaghetti?</i>

190
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:03,227
I thought if you knew I made a big mess
that you wouldn't love me anymore.

191
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,563
-[audience] Aw!
-Sabrina, that's not going to happen.

192
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,690
We're a family now, no matter what,

193
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,026
and I will always be there for you.

194
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:10,943
Okay.

195
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,361
[grunts]

196
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,947
Now, get in that kitchen
and eat all that spaghetti.

197
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,784
I gotta eat all that?
That's too much, man!

198
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,411
[studio audience applauds]

199
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,623
I never understood why
the <i>Horsin' Around</i> house

200
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,333
-had two sets of stairs.
-What?

201
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,169
One in the living room
and one in the kitchen. Why?

202
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,046
Have you ever been in a house like that?

203
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,715
-What are you doing here?
-You didn't answer your phone.

204
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,799
I was worried about you.

205
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,093
[takes deep breath]

206
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,305
The funeral was huge.
There were so many people there.

207
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,849
I kept thinking, "I did this to her,"

208
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,186
and everyone was just standing around
like, "Well, this was bound to happen,"

209
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,772
but... it wasn't bound to happen.

210
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,940
I'm really sorry, BoJack.

211
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,317
I don't know how to be, Diane.

212
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,653
It doesn't get better
and it doesn't get easier.

213
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,781
I can't keep lying to myself,
saying "I'm gonna change." I'm poison.

214
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,616
-BoJack--
-I come from poison.

215
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,786
I have poison inside me,
and I destroy everything I touch.

216
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,162
That's my legacy.

217
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,289
I have nothing to show
for the life that I've lived,

218
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,917
and I have nobody in my life
who's better off for having known me.

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,336
-That isn't true.
-Isn't it, though?

220
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,088
[sighs]

221
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,758
When I was a kid,
I used to watch you on TV.

222
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,260
And you know I didn't have
the best family.

223
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,137
Things weren't that great for me.

224
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,766
But, for half an hour every week,
I got to watch this show

225
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,602
about four people who had nobody,

226
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,772
who came together and became a family.

227
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,734
And, for half an hour every week,
I had a home,

228
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,861
and it helped me survive.

229
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:41,200
BoJack, there are millions of people
who are better off for having known you.

230
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,536
Why did you never tell me that?

231
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,415
I guess to preserve some fiction
of journalistic objectivity.

232
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,917
-Like that's a thing.
-I know you don't want to hear this,

233
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,878
but you're too good to be writing
Instagram captions for celebrities.

234
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,713
-I'm not just--
-I'm sorry, but you are.

235
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,133
-You know you are.
-Okay. Thank you.

236
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,803
And I wish you didn't get so distant
after you moved out.

237
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,973
-I'm sorry.
-You know me better than anybody,

238
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,392
and you can't not be a part of my life.

239
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,356
Tools! This is Brad.

240
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,775
-I want to do <i>Ethan Around.</i>
-Oh, very funny.

241
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,485
Is this Jeff from Hammers and More?

242
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,946
-No, it's me, BoJack Horseman.
-Wait, really?

243
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,491
Yeah. I think now more than ever
people need shows like <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

244
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,619
I... need a show like <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

245
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,664
Okay, but this isn't
like last time, is it?

246
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,332
Where you say you want to do it,

247
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,501
but then, I find out
you don't actually want to do it,

248
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,420
and then, your mean publicist yells at me?

249
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,922
And, at the airport, on the way home,
I get one of those big pretzels,

250
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,591
but then, I drop the pretzel
on the ground,

251
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,551
and it gets eaten by a ant?

252
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,719
What? No.

253
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,429
You won't regret this, BoJack.

254
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,183
Attention, customers!
Please leave and never come back.

255
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,394
Tools! is closed forever.
I'm going Hollywoo!

256
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,520
[gasps]

257
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,566
Please, please! I'm no hero.

258
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,943
I'm just a guy
with some bowls full of holes.

259
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,403
Thanks again.

260
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,198
It's funny. You help out
at one disaster area,

261
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,909
and, suddenly, everybody loves you,
unless you're Sean Penn.

262
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,785
Great PR for Cabracadabra, too.

263
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,080
Yeah, you can't buy that kind of press,
and you can buy most kinds of press.

264
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,500
I hope some of that press
makes its way to this reader

265
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,294
because she is not a fan
of Cabracadabra.

266
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:19,423
-She hates it.
-I don't hate Cabracadabra.

267
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,841
I just think it objectifies women

268
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,261
and contributes to a cheap and damaging
culture of sexist commodification

269
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,014
that undercuts the exact reason
it was started in the first place.

270
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,724
But, you know, everything does that.

271
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:33,062
<i>Cosmo </i>does that.
Kids' movies, athletic gear... statues.

272
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:37,191
Yes, but this objectification of women
ended up saving lots of lives,

273
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:41,695
many of whom were also women,
so, therefore, not sexist?

274
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,656
I can't argue with that.

275
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,783
Well, the good news is,
you don't have to anymore,

276
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,451
because I'm selling the company!

277
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,369
[both]
Oh!

278
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,621
You know, it's really too bad
you shut down the agency,

279
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,957
because, if you could've held out
for just a couple more months,

280
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,084
right now,
Vim would be rolling in money.

281
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,127
I'm really happy for you,

282
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,463
but I'm actually enjoying my time off.

283
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,131
Ralph and I went on vacation.

284
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,175
Can you believe this one
had never been to Cairo?

285
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,719
Those Egyptians really know
how to treat a cat.

286
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,181
And what do you do, Ralph,
that you can just hop on a plane to Cairo?

287
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,767
Well, I own and operate
my own greeting card company,

288
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,686
but everywhere I go, I have a free room.

289
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,772
-Oh, because you're a mouse?
-What? No.

290
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:20,234
-Because I'm a Stilton.
-Oh, my God! Like Stilton hotels?

291
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,486
-[ringtone playing]
-I gotta take this. It's my new agent.

292
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,113
-Hello?
-So, anyway--

293
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,240
[Mr. Peanutbutter]
Another offer? That's incredible!

294
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,325
-Ralph and I--
-They want to pay me how much?

295
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,452
That is a lot of zeroes. Sign me up.
[laughing]

296
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,621
What is he doing?
You never take the first offer.

297
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,832
[clears throat]
Hey, Diane, what have you been up to?

298
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,876
Well, I'm just weighing my options.

299
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,670
-I don't want to just jump into my next--
-You know what you should do?

300
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,214
Ralph's sister Stefani
is starting a new website.

301
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:47,469
It's a feminism/lifestyle/celebrity blog/
newsletter/community hub,

302
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:52,182
and she's looking for a partner/editor/
"bomb-ass super bitch," her words.

303
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,351
You'd be perfect for it.
I'll set a meeting.

304
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,104
Yeah, that could be cool.
Why don't you give her my info?

305
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:01,317
No, no. I'll just set a meeting.
It's easy. I'm not doing anything else.

306
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,652
-Except enjoying your time off, right?
-Right.

307
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,946
Wow, another amazing offer!

308
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,073
It's like everywhere I look,
money, money, money!

309
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,659
Even ten percent of this
would be quite a windfall.

310
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,577
[groans]

311
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,957
-I like your friends.
-Yeah.

312
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,042
And I like this.

313
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,084
[both]
Mwah!

314
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,003
-This is working.
-I like it, too.

315
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,422
That was smart of you
to think of Diane for GirlCrush.

316
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,798
You're always making great connections.

317
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,383
That's probably why you were
such a good manager.

318
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,678
-I wasn't a manager. I was an agent.
-Oh, right. Sorry.

319
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,597
Well, whatever it was,
I'm glad that it's over,

320
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,515
because I don't want
to share you with anybody.

321
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,684
Oh, my God!
Maybe that was the problem!

322
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,896
-Maybe what was the problem?
-All this time, I thought I was an agent,

323
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,982
but what if what I was really
supposed to be was a manager?

324
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,860
-What's the difference?
-It's a completely different line of work.

325
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,779
An agent helps a client find jobs,

326
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,573
but a manager helps manage
a client's career.

327
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,117
-It sounds exactly the same.
-I think I'm having an epiphany.

328
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,370
It's like I've been wearing
the wrong bra size this whole time.

329
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,914
Okay, if this is the thing
that'll make you happy,

330
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,666
then I totally support you,

331
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,878
but it kind of sounds like you're just
going back to the same sort of job

332
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,630
that made you miserable
for the last 20 years.

333
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,924
No, Ralph. Don't you get it?
This is a new beginning.

334
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,010
-I'm gonna be a manager!
-Oh...

335
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,431
-Wow.
-Takes you back, doesn't it?

336
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,558
Listen, before everyone
gets here tomorrow,

337
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,768
I have a couple notes on the script.

338
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,437
Too many "yowza-yowza bo-bowzas,"
or not enough?

339
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,106
No. On page 18,

340
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,900
Ethan and the Horse try to get Julia
to put on the roller skates,

341
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,068
and she runs out of the room crying,

342
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,903
and then, the Horse says,
"That went well."

343
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,324
-Anything about that feel weird to you?
-No, see, the Horse is being sarcastic.

344
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,494
It didn't go well. So, when the Horse
says, "That went well," it's funny.

345
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,746
-Dramatic irony.
-No, I get the irony.

346
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,582
That's not the issue.
This is a guaranteed laugh.

347
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,544
-You're giving me the cut to commercial.
-And that's a problem for you?

348
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:47,673
This is <i>Ethan Around. </i>It's your show,
and we need to tell the audience that.

349
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,843
-You can't give all the best jokes to me.
-I don't know, BoJack.

350
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,345
You really think I'm ready
for a "That went well"?

351
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,556
-You tell me. Let's hear it.
-That went well!

352
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,058
You're pushing too hard.
The line's funny. Trust the line.

353
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,352
-That went well.
-Great. Now let me hear you throw it away.

354
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,856
-Oh, like a-- That went well.
-Yes, that was great!

355
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,691
And that was a great look,
with the eyebrow.

356
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,484
-What if we both did that?
-Yeah, yeah.

357

"This parenting thing is gonna
be harder than I thought,"

359
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,241
and you're looking at me like,
"Now you see what I had to go through."

360
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,368
-Exactly. Let's try it.
-Well, that went well.

361
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,286

Hmm...

362
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,039
-Oh, my God. Chills.
-Yeah, you feel that?

363
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,207
-Yeah.
-Now that's how you cut to commercial.

364
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,751
That actually went well.

366
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,425
This place has really gone downhill
since they got that new chef.

00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,261
As I was saying, I don't think the site
needs to be just one thing.

00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,848
I think it can be a big umbrella,
but, like, also not an umbrella.

That's GirlCroosh.

370
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,851
Sorry, did you say "croosh"?

371
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,562
Oh, you do not need
to apologize here, Diane.

372
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,982
"Sorry" is a crutch
and "crutch" is an ableist term.

373
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,318
I'm sorry if that shocks you,
but I will not apologize for it.

374
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,820
So, can I ask what
the business model is here?

375
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,282
Diane, I'm rich.
I'm not doing this to make money.

376
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,993
I'm doing this to make connections
with real women

Well, you know what's great about that is,

00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,958
if you're not beholden to ad revenue,
your writers can--

381

Yes! That is exactly the idea,
whatever you were about to say.

I want to give you a real support system,

-One thing though. Is anything off limits?

about your husband, could you do it?

is basically Hooters on wheels?

-He's actually selling that company.
-Well, he's still a public figure.

If I have a problem with my husband,
I'm gonna talk to him about it directly.

395
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,584
Okay, so what if you did that
and he didn't listen,

396
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,045
and you knew that,
as much as you love him

397
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,716
and as much as he loves you,
he's never gonna get it?

398
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,845
And meanwhile, you also knew
that all your readers looked up to you

399
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,430
and wanted to read your opinion?

400
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,015
Would you write about it then?
