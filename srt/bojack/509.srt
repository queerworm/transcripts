All right! That was acting.

Hey, so, this has been real,
but since it's our last day,

20
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,306
it feels like maybe we should call it
on the whole us sleeping together thing.

21
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,933
I don't usually keep dating co-stars
once we've wrapped.

Would you say we're<i> co-stars?</i>

I mean, I'm Philbert.
I'd say we're more like both in the cast?

Yeah, let's definitely
pump the brakes on this.

but the emotional connection
just is not there.

62

It was the same with me and Yolanda.

earlier today,

00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,810
the question on everybody's mind is,

"What's Mr. Peanutbutter
going to do next?"

You're a serious actor now,

about global warming,

82
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,361
and then take a private jet
to the premiere?

I've been looking for new projects.

84
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,740
Seems like everything's based
on books these days,

85
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,660
so I went to the book store
to scout some material.

86
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,329
-Mm-hmm.
-But all the books are so long now.

-Yeah?
-Who has the time?

88
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,166
I'll just wait 'til the movie comes out,
then see the movie,

89
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,295
and decide if the book the movie
is based on would make a good movie.

90
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,671
Oh, that's a good strategy.

91
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:00,091
Anyway, I was heading to the door

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,909
I need ice cream
to smoosh the rest of it down.

165
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,660
Oh, I don't keep junk food in the house,

166
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,829
ever since last night
when I ate all of my ice cream.

167
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,416
Hey, why do you have a vodka bottle
for every day of the week?

168
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,294
Oh, that's just my new system I'm trying.
I'm down to one bottle a day.

169
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,172
-Is this like an AA thing?
-No, I don't need AA.

170
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,549
-Would you get outta there?
-I want ice cream.

171
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,009
-Give me your keys.
-What? No.

172
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,304
-Come on. Let me drive the Tesla.
-With your greasy pizza fingers?

173
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,890
-Forget it.
-Come on! [giggling]

174
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,433
-Hey.
-Ooh!

175
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,976
What the hell are these?

176
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,353
What? Oh, those...

177
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,605
Why was this in your pocket?
Are these for me?

178
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,689
No, Hollyhock. God, no.

179
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,900
Oh God, did you put this in my pizza?

180
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,820
What? Of course not. Hollyhock.
No. Give me the-- no!

181
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,323
-Oops.
-Hollyhock, those were for my back!

182
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,325
-Wait, for real?
-Yes.

183
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,994
Oh, then actually, oops.

184
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,705
[lock clicks]

185
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,585
-Hey, Todd. Is everything okay?
-I need to talk to someone,

186
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,880
and you're the only person I knew
would be available on a Friday night,

187
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,925
-with nothing to do.
-Hey, I almost went to the movies tonight!

188
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,302
It's not my fault there's never anything
in the 8:00 hour.

189
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,889
9:15 is too late. 7:00 is too early.
When am I supposed to eat dinner?

190
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:21,018
Uh, sneak in a bag of mashed potatoes
like the rest of us?

191
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,854
-Is this your whole apartment?
-It's a studio.

192
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,023
I ate lunch with a studio head
just yesterday.

193
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,568
-This is <i>not </i>a studio.
-What do you need, Todd?

194
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,529
Well, my friend, Emily,
did something really nice for me,

195
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,863
and I wanna pay her back.

196
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:37,243
-Thought you could help me brainstorm.
-Okay. What kind of things does she like?

197
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,120
Well, sex, for one.

198
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,497
Good for her!
A woman needs to know her own body

199
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,457
before she expects someone else
to know her body.

200
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,042
-What? What are we talking about?
-What?

201
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,211
I think sex, for one?

202
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,590
Oh! Diane, you sad-homed genius.

203
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,716
-You've cracked it!
-What?

204
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,677
To the junkyard
behind the engineering school!

205
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,513
-Always happy to contribute!
-[crashes]

206
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,765
[rattling]

207
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,102
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I freaked out.
-It's not your fault.

208
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,938
Your generation's been brainwashed
by McGruff the Crime Dog.

209
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,358
Who, by the way, I met at a party once?
Didn't ask me a single question about me.

210
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,737
Yeah, and also
because of the time I overdosed on pills.

211
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,614
Right, well, these were good pills.

212
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,492
I told you I'm on a system now.
I'm not "doing drugs." This was medicine.

213
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,493
Can you get more?

214
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,495
Oh, sure.
I'll just call the pharmacy and say,

215
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,456
"Hey, girl, you know
that highly-addictive opioid

216
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,459
I'm supposed to take every three hours?
Well, I kind of misplaced them,

217
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,754
so could I just get some more?
I'm totally not a drug addict."

218
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,839
-I'm really sorry.
-No. It's fine.

219
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,508
Let's enjoy our time together,
even though I'm in tremendous pain.

220
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,509
I'll try to forget it,

221
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,803
but the whole time
we might be thinking about it.

222
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,473
I do not blame you, but if you
blame yourself, that is okay with me.

223
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,434
You must know a place
you can get more painkillers.

224
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,352
I do know a guy,

225
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,812
but he's somewhat "south of Pico,"
if you know what I mean.

226
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,148
I don't. Why do Los Angeles people think

227
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,942
everyone else understands
your local references?

228
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,319
Okay, okay, let's go.

229
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,740
I can't believe you're adopting.

230
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,617
I just realized
it was the right thing for me.

231
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,287
I just remember you were so adamant
about having the baby yourself,

232
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,998
even when I said we should talk
about other options.

233
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,833
-Yeah, but the way you said it--
-I'm not mad.

234
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,045
I just think it's funny you had
that change of heart <i>after </i>we broke up.

235
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,463
[sighs]

236
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,424
[sighs] I'm sorry. This is not about me.

237
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,760
You'll be a great mom,
and I'm really happy for you.

238
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,470
-Yeah?
-Of course.

239
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,972
Well, one day,
you're gonna be a great dad.

240
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,767
-Hopefully as cool as Birthday Dad!
[chuckles]

241
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,814
-Why are we at the pediatrician?
-Trust me.

242
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:34,026
This doctor is the sleaziest, dopiest,
scurviest of the scurvy.

243
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,945
-Who is he?
-Exactly.

244
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,614
-[Hollyhock yelps]
-Hu... wants to par-tay?

245
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,866
Dr. Hu! Thank you for squeezing us in!

246
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,993
You always gotta make time
for your friends.

247
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,371
And I haven't seen you
since Sarah Lynn's funeral.

248
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,330
Oh, right.

249
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,375
That was a huge wake-up call for me.

250
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,212
Next morning I looked in the mirror,
and you know who I saw staring back at me?

251
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,422
-[Hollyhock] Who?
-Exactly.

252
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,423
-What?
-No. Hu.

253
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,135
I spent 30 days at Pastiches Malibu
and now I'm sober.

254
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,722
It's like I completely regenerated
as a brand-new doctor.

255
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,723
Congratulations.

256
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,726
You'd have to be a real lost cause
not to seek help

257
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,936
after losing Sarah Lynn like that,
don't you think?

258
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,813
Oh, deffo. I mean, you know, get help

259
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,149
or, you know,
work out a system on your own.

260
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,067
Even, you know, whatever's right for you.

261
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,862
Anyway, I'm trying to get my hands
on some Feelbetterin?

262
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,779
Feelbetterin?

263
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,365
BoJack, have you been taking
oxypraxylcortizoid?

264
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,577
Yeah. I know what you're thinking,
but I legitimately have a herniated disc.

265
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,703
He's telling the truth!

266
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:29,415
I threw out his pills because of my trauma
from when I got drugged by his mama.

267
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,876
-You got drugged by your own mother?
-No, my mother.

268
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,295
Her mother was a maid
who got knocked up by my dad,

269
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,464
but she got adopted by eight other dads.

270
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,675
Okay, do you know how many times
I hear this story every week?

271
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,927
This story, specifically?
Even the "eight dads" part?

272
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:46,599
I don't know who you think you're fooling,
but this Hu won't get fooled again.

273
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,061
Thank you for coming, Emily.

274
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,982
What's with all the candles?
Why are you wearing a robe?

275
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,527
Oh, I blew a fuse earlier,
so I had to light candles.

276
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,780
That took a while,
and then I didn't get to change.

277
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,865
-Oh.
-Hold that thought.

278
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,784
-The thought of "Oh"?
-That's right.

279
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,037
Because you're gonna need it
when you meet your new best friend...

280
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,705
-Uh...
-[grunts]

281
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,874
-Whoa!
-Henry Fondle!

282
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,792
[robot screaching]

283
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,169
-What? What?
-He's a sex robot!

284
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,756
So, you can stop dating
all those boring guys and still have sex!

285
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,092
-Stop me if you've heard this one. What?
-And guess what?

286
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,054
I even recorded dozens
of sexy robot phrases

287
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,097
-for it to say at random intervals!
-[clicks]

288
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,434
[robot] <i>I am Henry Fondle.</i>
<i>Insert me into genitals!</i>

289
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,813
-Why did you do this?
-To show you that I care about your needs.

290
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,357
[robot] <i>My prime directive</i>
<i>is to pleasure you.</i>

291
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,902
Todd, I'm not sure you understand
how sex works.

292
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,363
That is so condescending.

293
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,115
I know what sex is. I am not a child.

294
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,576
I'm just not great at building robots.

295
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,079
This is my first one, and frankly,

296
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,457
I think it's pretty impressive
I put it together in one afternoon.

297
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,126
<i>I love it when you call me "Father."</i>

298
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,211
-[clatters]
-[both gasp]

299
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,881
Oh, no!
My wacky scheme backfired as always!

300
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,135
-I'm really sorry.
-It's fine.

301
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,429
We're spending time together,
that's all that matters.

302
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,557
You're not super-mad at me, still?

303
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,892
When this is done,
maybe it'll make a great story

304
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,853
you can tell that kid you have a crush on.

305
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,605
Who, Joby? [chuckles]
I don't have a crush on him.

306
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,650
Get out of here.
His jawline is, like, dumb.

307
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,610
-Oh, okay.
-Where are we going now?

308
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,030
There's this actress I was kind of seeing
while we were working together

309
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,949
and I might have left some pills
at her place.

310
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,411
She made it clear she doesn't want
to see me again but she's not home now.

311
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,621
-Why do I know Gina's schedule?
-Where is she?

312
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,333
She has a book club with dumb Nicole
who keeps picking very long Italian books

313
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,753
that Nicole doesn't even read.
Why do I know about Gina's friends?

314
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,172
-Do you have a key?
-I have my ways.

315
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,010
-Well, I'm out of ways.
-I'll go around back

316
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,928
and see if there's a window
I can climb through.

317
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,930
Ooh, good thinking! I'll stand guard.

318
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,974
[winces] Ugh.

319
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,059
Oh, shit.

320
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,269
BoJack?

321
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,354
Oh, my God! What happened to book club?

322
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,523
We switched it to Thursdays
to confuse Nicole.

323
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:03,193
-Why are you here?
-I just wanted to check on you.

324
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,403
[Gina sighs]

325
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,447
[gasps]

326
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,283
-[gasps]
-Wait, Gina. No, stay outside.

327
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,535
I just-- I need to talk to you.

328
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,661
Slowly.

329
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,205
Is this about our relationship?
What is there to talk about?

330
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,957
Well, I just been thinking that...

331
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,711
we should<i> keep looking</i>
at this relationship.

332
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,047
Like<i> all</i> parts of this relationship.

333
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,759
Like even in the <i>junk drawer,</i>
<i>in the kitchen </i>of this relationship.

334
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:30,638
-Or <i>the bathroom cabinet.</i>
-I told you I didn't want to see you.

335
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,182
I want you to know
that you are top-shelf, Gina.

336
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:37,144
-Know what I mean? <i>Top shelf.</i>
-So, what, you wanna get back together?

337
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,395
-Eh...?
-Yes!

338
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,480
Wait, really?

339
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,814
-Okay, I gotta run.
-BoJack.

340
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,693
I have had 28 on-set flings,
and no guy has ever come to my house

341
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,154
after shooting was over to try
to have a real relationship.

342
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,406
-Well...
-I guess I sort of internalized the idea

343
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,574
I didn't deserve that?

344
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,284
Yeah, but like I said, I really gotta run.

345
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,954
But maybe I do deserve it.
Maybe we both do.

346
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,040
BoJack, is it possible that we're the ones
we've been waiting for?

347
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,793
Uh, yes. I totally think that is possible,

348
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,003
which is why I can't wait
to talk about this tomorrow!

349
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,172
-What? Where are you going?
-I'll call you!

350
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,841
[Hollyhock panting] Whoa!

351
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,427
Think I need to call her,
or did I leave things open enough

352
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,137
-where I can kinda ghost?
-What?

353
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,140
Kidding! I'll call her.
I'm very fond of that woman.

354
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,101
And I'm sure
that things are gonna work out fine,

355
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,853
and we can find a way to be happy together
and I won't hurt her

356
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,314
in a way that she carries with her
for the rest of her life.

357
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,608
-Uh, okay.
-Lemme get them pills.

358
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,820
-What the hell? These aren't my pills!
-Sorry!

359
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,990
-Not your fault. It's just... my back.

360
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,158
-I got another idea.
-Okay.

361
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:38,122
-Do you think Gina needed those?
-She'll be fine. Nobody<i> needs</i> pills.

362
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,127
-You could've just dropped me off.
-I wanted to be here.

363
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,879
-Hope that's okay.
-It's actually nice you're here.

364
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,632
All the times I imagined us
taking home a baby from the hospital,

365
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,009
I never pictured it like this.

366
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,469
You mean, you never pictured
it would happen on a Friday?

367
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,514
[laughs] Yeah, exactly.
That's the main difference.

368
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,269
[sighs] How come you never called me
after I kicked you out of my apartment?

369
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,771
You were so mad at me.
I didn't think you wanted me to.

370
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,482
I didn't.
But you still should have called.

371
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,943
-Well, you could have called me.
-Yeah.

372
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,447
-I wish you'd stayed with me that night.
-You told me to leave.

373
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,658
Yeah. I guess the lesson is,
don't listen to me, right?

374
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,243
[Ralph chuckles] Mm-hmm.

375
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,663
Is that really what you're gonna wear
for the first time your new baby sees you?

376
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,624
-Yes?
-Oof! Okay.

377
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,048
I'm supposed to be back
at the airport in, like, two hours.

378
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,175
Is this really
how you want to spend this time?

379
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,844
Again, and... [chuckles]
I hate to keep harping on this,

380
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,597
we wouldn't be here
if someone hadn't dumped my medicine.

381
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,475
I know, but this place is super sketchy.

382
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,436
It looks like
where they did the drag race in<i> Grease.</i>

383
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,396
It <i>is </i>where they did the drag race
in<i> Grease.</i>

384
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,732
-Where do you think they make movies?
-Ooh!

385
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,525
-[Hollyhock yelps]
-[tires screech]

386
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,570
-You a cop?
-What? No. Oh, shit.

387
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,114
No, it's a costume.
I just finished filming a show.

388
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,201
Normally, people return the costume.

389
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,204
Hello, drug merchant.
Is it<i> lit</i> under here?

390
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,121
What?

391
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,791
Are there illegal pharmaceuticals
available for purchase?

392
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,709
And please, talk into my lollipop.

393
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,587
-Okay, this guy's a cop.
-I assure you I am not.

394
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,423
He's just saying that
because earlier I said he was a cop.

395
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,968
No. You can see the outline of his badge
under his tee-shirt!

396
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,555
-Yeah, no, he's definitely a cop.
-Seems cool to me.

397
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,265
Listen. If I were a cop,

398
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,642
I'd have pancake breath

399
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,353
from the precinct's
weekly Friday night pancake dinners.

400
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,773
-But I do not. So clearly, not a cop.
-Uh...

401
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,568
Unless, I somehow had an Altoid,
or a Tic-Tac after,

402
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,030
which again, no.
[chuckles] I am a gum guy.

403
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,324
That all tracks for me.
Here are your drugs.

404
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,243
-Aha! We got the package!
-Whoa!

405
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,161
-[tires screech, siren wails]
-[BoJack] Run!

406
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,871
-[Hollyhock gasps]
-They're getting away!

407
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,957
-Go, go, go!
-[siren wails]

408
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,627
-[BoJack panting]
-[Hollyhock moans]

409
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,045
-[Hollyhock] Oh, no!
-Here, get up.

410
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,296
[both grunting]

411
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,382
[grunts]

412
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,010
-Eh...?
-Come on! We have to keep moving!

413
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,470
[groans]

414
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,515
-[hissing]
-[Emily] Ooh!

415
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,350
-Thanks, Doug.
-I'm not here for you.

416
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,353
I'm here because I respect the art
of putting out fires. [puffs]

417
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,231
- I'm really sorry, Emily.
-It was a sweet idea.

418
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,733
I guess I just thought
you waste so much time

419
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,194
with these boring firemen
just for the sex.

420
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,155
-Eh?
-Doug, some privacy, please?

421
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,156
Okay.

422
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:21,201
Maybe I figured if you had some other way
to satisfy yourself sexually,

423
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,912
then you could spend more time with me.

424
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,249
-Like we did in high school.
-Todd, we were dating in high school.

425
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,794
Do you ever think about
what it would be like if we dated now?

426
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,505
I don't know. What would it be like?

427
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,883
I guess we'd hang out together,
like we already do.

428
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,760
And you would be my favorite person,
like you already are.

429
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,681
And when something good happened to me,
like if I got a promotion at work,

430
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,808
you'd be the first person I'd tell,

431
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,312
and you'd smile and say,
"That's my boyfriend."

432
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,773
Well, that could be cool.
But then I would have sex with the robot?

433
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,775
[whirring] <i>Boop, boop, boop! Oh!</i>

434
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,319
-[splatters]
-[sighs] Uh-hh!

435
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,613
<i>-Hooray.</i>
-I guess it's not ideal.

436
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,324
You know,
when I was putting the app together,

437
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,619
I learned that some asexuals
actually <i>do </i>have sex.

438
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,915
-Do you... think that there's a chance?
-[mutters] Um-umm.

439
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:12,461
-Okay. Well, you got any other ideas?
-Hmm.

440
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:17,799
What about if marbles were cube-shaped,
so they don't roll away as much?

441
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,344
-No dice.
-[sighs]

442
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,806
[Princess Carolyn] Oh, he's beautiful.

443
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,768
Do you think I'm terrible
for giving him away?

444
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,353
What? Of course not.

445
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,355
I don't know the first thing
about being a parent.

446
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,815
-Bridget, it's okay.
-Your baby's in excellent hands.

447
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,276
I'm just so glad he's going
to a good home,

448
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,737
-with a mother and a father.
-What's this, now?

449
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,491
I mean, if my boyfriend was still
in the picture, maybe I could be a parent,

450
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,161
but as is, I think the baby's
probably better off with you two.

451
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,829
-Oh, no, Ralph's not--
-That's right!

452
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,957
We're gonna make
a wonderful family together.

453
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,501
-Ralph, don't lie to her.
-I'm not lying.

454
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,711
A year ago, we wanted to have
a family together.

455
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,464
-I still want that.
-Ralph, no. You should go.

456
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,217
I hear you say that, but I'm not making
the mistake I made last time.

457
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,176
I don't want this.

458
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,470
This seems like a subject
you should have agreed on

459
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,097
before you came to the hospital.

460
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,266
We can do this. Nothing has changed.

461
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,394
I changed! I have plans now,
and you're not in them.

462
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:14,356
-You don't need to do this by yourself.
-I never needed to. I <i>want </i>to.

463
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,358
I'm not afraid of how hard it's gonna be.

464
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:21,363
I already love this baby.
And that gives me so much power.

465
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,240
I don't need anything else.

466
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,951
Oh, my God, I just realized something.

467
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,746
If you can do it by yourself,
maybe that means I can do it by myself.

468
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,291
-Uh...
-No, no, Bridget, you definitely can't.

469
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,378
I thought I couldn't.
But that speech you gave was so inspiring.

470
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,549
It made me realize that all I need
to be a good mother is love.

471
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,761
Actually, you need <i>so </i>much more than that.
I was wrong when I said that a second ago.

472
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,099
[chuckles] Okay. But for real,
give me my baby boy.

473
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,101
-[moans] Oh-hh...
-Coochie-coochie-choo...

474
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,229
-[moans]
-Princess Carolyn, you are amazing.

475
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,690
-Can you be <i>my </i>mom?
-[groans] Oh-hh!

476
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,818
[both panting]

477
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,196
[coughing]
There's gotta be another way to get pills.

478
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,741
How about calling this Joby?
He sounds like a druggie.

479
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,868
-I thought your back hurts.
-Yeah.

480
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,621
-How did you lift me over the fence?
-Well, the adrenaline kicked in.

481
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,541
-Do you <i>really </i>need these pills?
-Hollyhock, how many times--

482
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,835
I'm just saying,
is it possible maybe you don't--

483
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,213
Okay. You go to college
and suddenly you're so sophisticated,

484
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,591
-and I'm a dumb junkie, is that it?
-What? No!

485
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,842
You don't understand anything!

486
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,303
-I am in pain.
-No, I get that.

487
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,472
All the time. my whole life.
And you have no idea.

488
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,016
So, sorry that you had one bad experience
with my mom,

489
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,644
but I have been in pain my whole life.

490
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,604
[sighs]

491
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,691
I think you should take me to the airport.

492
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,193
Okay.

493
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,409
-You're sure I can't drive you home?
-No, Ralph.

494
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,870
Can I at least wait with you for the cab?

495
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,331
[sighs] Okay.

496
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,047
[buckle clicks]

497
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,260
So, I guess I'll see you later.

498
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,389
-Hollyhock, I'm sorry.
-Me, too.

499
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,433
Maybe, it's possible that I don't...

500
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,604
100-percent need-need the pills.

501
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,648
I thought I did, but-- yeah.

502
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,859
So, thank you for... caring about me.

503
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,278
-Are you gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

504
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,781
I could take a semester off,
if you need someone--

505
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:31,576
No. God, no. Stay... stay in school.

506
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,580
And take your classes, and kiss boys,
and do the college thing.

507
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,375
I'm gonna be fine.
I get it. Drugs are bad.

508
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,127
Not all drugs.

509
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,672
Obviously, if you get hurt again,
and a doctor, a real doctor

510
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,216
prescribes you painkillers,
you can take them.

511
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,802
-But only if you get hurt again.
-Okay.

512
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,430
-You promise?
-Yes. I promise.

513
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,057
Okay. I love you.

514
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,851
[sighs] Hmm.

515
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,980
Okay. Bye.

516
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,536
[whirring]

517
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,122
[clicks, beeping]

518
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,378
[sighs]

519
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,551
[sighs] Whew.

520
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,678
[traffic noises]

521
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,348
[hatch clicks]

522
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,688
Ugh!

523
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,568
[panting]

524
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,863
Uh...

525
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,740
[groaning]

526
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,658
-[groaning]
-[tires screech]

527
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,202
[crashing]
