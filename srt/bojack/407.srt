Whew.

-BoJack?
-I'm back in L.A.

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,229
-I should have called you--
-Yeah. You should have.

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,356
-I said I was sorry.
-No, you didn't.

7
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,985
-Okay. Good to hear from you, BoJack.
-No--

Okay, thank you.

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,415
What's going on here?

13
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,918
Fundraising dinner for the Peanutbutter
for California campaign.

14
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,005
-All right, I'm just gonna--
-Sorry. It's a fundraiser.

15
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,757
-Uh...
-BoJack!

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,759
I love your ironic take
on black-tie attire.

17
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,012
It really says,
"I truly don't care what you think of me."

18
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,514
This light bulb won't let me in
to your house without paying.

19
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,726
Ah, sorry about that.
Gotta raise those funds.

20
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,770
-Can't I just--
-Thanks for your support, buddy.

21
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,521
-Means so much. Erica!
-Hey--

22
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,899
Look at you,
with the right number of ears!

23
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,193
-Look, I just--
-Twenty thousand dollars a plate.

Oh.

27
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,494
Hey, do you have another bathroom?
They're all occupied, and I gotta pee.

28
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,079
Not because I'm pregnant or anything.

29
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,998
Because if I were pregnant, it would be
bad luck to tell you this early.

30
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,875
Presuming it was early.
But I'm not pregnant.

31
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,586
This is just a normal,
non-pregnant gal type of having to pee.

32
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,047
-There's a bathroom in the pool house.
-You're a lifesaver.

33
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,465
Pardon me! Out of my way.

34
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,217
Uh-oh. Am I in Ithaca?

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,677
Because you are looking
"gorges" this evening.

36
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,307
Well, I must be in Nazi Germany,
because you're "not so" bad yourself.

37
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,601
-I'm sorry, yours was better.
-[BoJack] Hi.

38
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,061
Whoa.

40
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,480
Well, I should go.

41
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:49,275
Looks like the work wife/ex-wife
is talking to my other ex-wife.

42
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,320
-You have two ex-wives here?
-Katrina's his campaign manager.

43
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,115
[Peanutbutter] And Jessica Biel loves
getting photographed at fancy fundraisers.

44
00:01:55,198 --> 00:02:00,203
If it isn't my two favorite ladies,
in the same room! This is great.

45
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,913
-Hey.
-BoJack, I'm busy.

46
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,331
You haven't seen me for a year and a half.

47
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,875
Yeah, because you disapp--
No, I am not doing this now.

48
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,211
-Why don't you get yourself a drink?
-I will get a drink.

49
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,214
I will get $20,000 worth of drinks.

Hi, Zach Braff. Zach Braff.

55
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,808
Hey there. Famous actor Zach Braff,
how you doing?

-Everyone? Thank you all for being here.

We're gonna beat that scoundrel

Boo!

[cheering]

61
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,240
I especially want to thank my pro-fracking
pals for being here tonight.

62
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,119
You know, my wife said, "Don't frack,"
but we did it anyway,

63
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,371
and it all worked out.
Love you, sweetie.

64
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,289
Mm-hmm.

65
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,416
Finally-- oh!
Sorry about that, folks.

66
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,418
I sensed an earthquake.
Must have been a false--

67
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,961
Oh, hey now!

68
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,796
Nope, I was definitely wrong.

69
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,382
Listen to me,
I'm the dog who cried earthquake.

-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-I can't die!

00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,102
I'm not famous enough yet to make
the "In Memoriam" montage at the Oscars!

75
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,562
I have so many regrets!

76
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,481
I just picked up a family sitcom

It's called<i> Mombie, </i>and it's terrible!

I sense a shift in power dynamics,

I have a tiny orgasm!

80
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,327
I have no original ideas,
I just repeat things I hear.

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,662
-I've never been in love!
-I've never been in love!

82

Okay. Everyone, remain calm!

{\an8}Well, except for San Andreas.

108

{\an8}This was because you fracked
under our house.

and murder each other.

It's a Prius. A silver Prius.

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,164
[sighs]
Mr. Peanutbutter, you can do this.

167
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,249
Be the leader that I know you can be.

168
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,793
Yeah. You're right. I've totally got this.

169
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,212
-[bangs]
-What in the world?

170
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,757
<i>"Vox clamantis in deserto."</i>

171
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,259
-It is I.
-Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz!

172
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,469
-We're saved!
-Wow!

173
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,678
Oh, thank God. A leader.

174
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,930
-[Diane laughs]
-[BoJack] Sh.

175
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,682
What's going on down here?
Anyone's looking for us?

176
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,768
We're cool. Just being cool, don't worry.

177
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,146
Diane, have you just been getting drunk
with BoJack this whole time?

178
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,149
-What? I'm still mad at you.
-[BoJack laughing]

179
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,985
-Citizens, remain calm.
-Yeah, that's what I've been saying!

180
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,571
Rescue workers are coming
but it could be a while.

181
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,533
State emergency funds have been depleted
due to budget overruns

182
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,827
on a costly bridge to Hawaii
that's being constructed.

183
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,745
Oh, yeah!

184
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,831
Since a woodchuck is a digging animal,
I came to get you out early.

185
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:05,169
Is that what a woodchuck is?
Why did I think it was like a beaver?

186
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,755
What's it like out there, Woodchuck?
Whole neighborhood totaled?

187
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,591
-Is the city in chaos?
-No, it's really just your house.

188
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,262
Because of all the fracking that's been
happening underneath your house.

189
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,722
Oh! Interesting!

190
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,266
-Ay-yi-yi.
-Oh, right, right.

191
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:23,229
So you just burrowed down here to rescue
your political opponent's top donors.

192
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,355
That's convenient.

193
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,440
It was actually very inconvenient,

194
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,528
but I put politics aside
to save you people from dying.

195
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,405
Three cheers for Woodchuck!

196
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,573
[all]
Hip, hip, hooray!

197
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,325
Please, don't cheer too loudly.
The tunnel is very delicate.

198
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,578
-Hip, hip, hooray!
-Seriously, I think it's best to--

199
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,288
-Hip, hip, hooray!
-[rumbling]

200
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,624
[sighs]

201
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,669
-Let's cheer one more time, just for fun!
-No, please.

202
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,630
-Four cheers. Why not? Hip, hip...
-Hooray!

203
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,132
-No!
-[rumbling]

204
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,635
[screams]

205
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:59,599
So turns out three cheers was probably
an adequate number of cheers.

206
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,272
[rumbling]

207
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,149
-What was that?
-Just keep walking.

208
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,567
God, I can't wait to get home.

209
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,235
I don't even have a home anymore.

210
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:15,615
Oh, man, where am I going to keep all
my different colored hats I never wear?

211
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,576
Well, if you need another couch
to crash on, there's always my place.

212
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,455
-Didn't you move in with Ralph?
-Yeah, but I kept the old apartment.

213
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,166
-Just in case, I guess.
-In case of what?

214
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,667
-[faint chattering]
-What was that?

215
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,377
Whoa!

216
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,129
Oh!

217
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:32,965
[yelps]

218
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,968
Now, ladies, just calm down.
We can talk about this.

219
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,137
What are we gonna do, Princess Carolyn?

220
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,138
[ants gasp]

221
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,931
[chattering]

222
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,393
Did you say you're a princess?

223
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,229
-That's just my name. I'm a manager.
-It's like an agent.

224
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,440
-It's totally different.
-Is it, though?

225
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:53,444
-Silence! You negotiate deals?
-Mm-hmm.

226
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:57,698
You could be of service, Manager Carolyn.

227
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,991
[ant leader laughs]

228
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,538
My hands... they're crushed.

229
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,582
There's no way I can dig us back out now.

230
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,750
Well, I can dig!

231
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,877
Actually, no one should dig.

232
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,129
Your foundation is basically Swiss cheese.

233
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,591
The slightest provocation could cause
another collapse that would crush us all.

234
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:16,509
[all gasp]

235
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,304
I know that because I bought a sitcom
about fracking, <i>The Frack Shack.</i>

236
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,057
It's <i>New Girl</i> meets fracking.
[chuckles]

237
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,351
Oh, God, no one's gonna watch
that show, huh?

238
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,602
[groans]

239
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,314
Someone will be coming for us soon.
In the meantime, we must organize.

240
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,733
Parcel out food and water
and see how much we've got.

241
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,404
-I'll assign team leaders.
-Oh, no. I'm sensing a shift in power.

242
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,197
[groans]

243
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,742
[guests chuckling]

244
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,661
All right. Um...

245
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,372
-God...!
-For you, a banana

246
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,083
-because you're so appealing.
-Yeah.

247
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,085
And for you, a radish. Enjoy.

248
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,878
Mr. Peanutbutter, this is a disaster.

249
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,340
I don't think so.
I'm food captain, and I am loving it.

250
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,467
-And who made you the food captain?
-Woodchuck.

251
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,636
Exactly. He's in charge.

252
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,556
Excuse me,
you have not been allocated those rations.

253
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,226
I'm a horse. I need more food,
and I'm a celebrity.

254
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,979
-Everyone down here is a celebrity.
-Not the caterers.

255
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,564
Relinquish the food.

256
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,065
Hey. Here's your chance.

257
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,904
Actually, Woodchuck, this is my house
and BoJack can eat whatever he wants.

258
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,032
This man has already reached
his allotted food portion for the day.

259
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,868
Who said we have to go by your rules?

260
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,328
Yeah, who made you leader
of underground?

261
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,038
I'm just gonna take all this and...

262
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,541
You've appointed me.
Yes, I under-- citizens, look...

263
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,918
Keep it together.
[grunts]

264
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,338
-Weird stuff going on downstairs.
-[clicking]

265
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,590
Humph.

266
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,551
-I can't believe this is my life.
-Uh-oh.

267
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,137
Too much sad booze for you.
Where's the happy booze?

268
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,223
I'm trapped underground
and it's all my husband's fault

269
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:51,270
and I'm gonna die in this mansion
in a mass grave with his ex-wives.

270
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,814
Okay. But on the bright side--

271
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:58,194
Look, Mr. Peanutbutter loves you,
you got a cool job, you got friends.

272
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,778
Jesus, you're right.

273
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,073
Even when I was above ground,
I wasn't satisfied.

274
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,243
Oh, my God. I'm the problem!

275
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,455
[sobbing]

276
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,207
Whoa!

277
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,124
What the...?

278
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,545
Why can't I be happy? Am I busted?

279
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,922
No. It...

280
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,674
I am! I'm a pit.

281
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,553
I'm a pit that good things fall into!

282
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,971
Diane, you're not a pit.

283
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,099
I'm a pit!
[sobbing]

284
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,685
[sighs]

285
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,024
I can't believe I'm crying.
This is so dumb.

286
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,860
It's okay.
Don't feel bad about feeling bad.

287
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,571
You disappeared for a year and a half.

288
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,491
So you do want to talk about it.
Just took four solid days of drinking.

289
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,827
If you were back in L.A.,
why didn't you call me?

290
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,414
-I wasn't... ready.
-Ready? For what?

291
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,042
I wanted to be better
when you saw me again.

292
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,128
And I thought I could be, somehow.
But I'm not.

293
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,173
And even if I did get better,
the best I could ever be

294
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,760
is still just some other version of me.

295
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:08,681
BoJack, I can't wait for you to be better.

296
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,766
I need you in my life.

297
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,477
-Really?
-You're the biggest asshole I know,

298
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,105
and you're the only thing
that makes sense to me.

299
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,440
[Diane sighs, moans]

300
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,946
People should be able to have
some control over their lives down here.

301
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,906
-Yeah!
-People need boundaries.

302
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,242
Leadership means
sometimes being the bad guy.

303
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,995
You hear that? Woodchuck's a bad guy!

304
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,788
I don't want a bad guy to be our leader.

305
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,915
-That's not...
-That's a point for Mr. Peanutbutter.

306
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,501
And I'm the good guy,
so that's two points for me.

307
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,086
What points? There are no points.

308
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,922
-This is not a game!
-Well, maybe there should be points.

309
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,215
-Yeah!
-Points!

310
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,844
People seem to like my points idea.
That's another point for me.

311
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,763
Well, I'm the one who came down here
to save you in the first place.

312
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,348
Surely I get points for that.

313
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,602
Asking for points is conceited.
That's more points for me.

314
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,603
-He's right!
-What?!

315
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,813
If you came down to save us,
why are we still here?

316
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,856
[all] Yeah!

317
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,566
You had one job, and you couldn't do it!

318
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,567
-Yeah!
-That's right.

319
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,860
Minus point for Woodchuck.

320
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,071
I implore you not to fall
into a mob mentality.

321
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,824
-He called us a mob! Let's kill him!
-Yeah!

322
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,536
Folks, Woodchuck's political philosophy
is as broken as his hands.

323
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,289
That is a convincing argument.
He does have broken hands.

324
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,626
Maybe it's time an outsider took control.

325
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,671
An outsider like me,
the guy whose house this is.

326
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,257
[chanting]
Peanutbutter, Peanutbutter.

327
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,675
Peanutbutter-- everybody.

328
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,136
[chanting]
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!

329
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,220
Peanutbutter!

330
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,388
-Me!
-Peanutbutter!

331
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,806
-Me!
-Peanutbutter!

332
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,850
[faint chanting]
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter...

333
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
-[snoring]
-BoJack. BoJack.

334
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,103
-BoJack.
-What?

335
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,397
-Did you know I can juggle?
-Cool.

336
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,692
Are you okay?
I mean, outside of our current situation

337
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,861
of being buried alive
and almost out of alcohol

338
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,947
except for cooking sherry and Midori?

339
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,533
It's just been a rough couple years
with Sarah Lynn dying and Herb.

340
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,202
-And Corduroy?
-Cordu-what now?

341
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:58,332
Corduroy? Jackson-Jackson?
Died of autoerotic "asphyx-ization"?

342
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,918
Oh, yeah, him too. And now I got this...

343
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,005
girl in my house, this... daughter-type.

344
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,257
You got daughter? Ruh-roh.

345
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,635
-[clatters]
-Yeah, I got daughter, "ruh-roh."

346
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,637
Supposed to help her figure out
who her mother is.

347
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,972
But I don't know where to start.

348
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,433
Did she try sending mutual consent form
to the adoption agency?

349
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,643
What, what words?

350
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,355
Well, if it's closed adoption,
you send a mutual consent form.

351
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,816
Basically says, "I wanna be open now!"

352
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,445
If Mom says same thing,
boom-bah-boo! Smo-pen Sesame!

353
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,073
-How do you know about that?
-I had an adopted brother.

354
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,367
And also for a while,
I hoped I was adopted.

355
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,369
-Ugh!
-Huh.

356
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,622
-Whoa!
-Ooh!

357
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,960
Who dares disturb Queen Antonia?

358
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,378
My name is Princess Carolyn.

359
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,464
I represent the soldiers
of Subcolony K-147,

360
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,801
who feel they're doing all the work
while reaping none of the spoils.

361
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,596
Everything my soldiers do
benefits the colony.

362
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,182
I had this same conversation
with Jeffrey Katzenberg.

363
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,268
Believe me, this doesn't end well
for you.

364
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,103
[sighs]
What are your demands?

365
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,688
[whispers]

366
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,190
They want to have sex with your drones.

367
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,109
<i>My </i>drones?

368
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,028
[dance music plays]

369
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,112
Mm-hmm.

370
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,448
Oliver, assemble the small council.

371
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,160
Uh, If we're gonna be down here a while,
can I get a new towel?

372
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,704
[guests chanting]

373
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,457
Woodchuck's aa-always telling us
what to do!

374
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,585
He says help is coming,
but how does he know? What if he's lying?

375
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,546
[wails]
And I have still not been validated!

376
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,131
If you could all be patient...

377
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,633
We're sick of waiting!
It's time for new leadership.

378
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,343
That attempted movie star is right!

379
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,473
I declare Mr. Peanutbutter
President-for-life of Underground.

380
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,390
[guests] Yeah!

381
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,933
[grunting]
Uh, uh, oh!

382
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,393
-Thank you!
-What? No!

383
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,104
-What do we do with Woodchuck?
-He must be made an example of.

384
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,272
-[man] Get him!
-Yeah!

385
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,357
All right, guys, all right. Calm down.

386
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,652
We don't need to "get him."
Let's just tie him up someplace

387
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,072
where he can't hurt us anymore
with his dangerous ideas.

388
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:57,367
Do not tie me up. That isn't necessary.
No, don't-- no...!

389
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,702
-[chanting] Peanutbutter!
-No!

390
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,330
-Peanutbutter!
-Thank you, thank you all.

391
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,375
As my first act as President-for-life,
I declare that everyone

392
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,295
is allowed to eat and drink
whatever they want!

393
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,755
[all] Yeah!

394
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,090
[crashing]

395
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,010
-[groans]
-[whimpers]

396
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,386
Agh--!

397
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,888
I'm starving,

398
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,516
and not the normal celebrity
kind of starving like I always am.

399
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,017
Or even red-carpet-season starving.

400
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,436
-Where's the food?
-[Woodchuck] You ate all the food.

401
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,730
This is it!

402
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,900
Nobody's coming for us.
We need to kill someone for food.

403
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,944
-Hmm...!
-Oh...!

404
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,403
Let's eat Mr. Peanutbutter!

405
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,739
He has the word "peanut butter"
in his name!

406
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,782
[all] Yeah!

407
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:40,244
Guys, guys, guys,
maybe we don't need to eat anybody!

408
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,829
-[all groan]
-What's this now?

409
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,914
Let's listen to the guy
who's saying don't kill me.

410
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,499
He's got some interesting ideas.

411
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,126
Listen to me, everyone. Please.

412
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,379
I'm known for monologues
that sum things up at the end of the show.

413
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,798
I drive a Prius,
which means I'm a good person.

414
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,634
Let's not surrender
to our basest instincts.

415
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,720
I know times are tough,
but I'm sure if we band together

416
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,973
and really concentrate
on the problem at hand,

417
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,225
we can, as a group of friends--
[screams]

418
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,062
-Oh, my God.
-Biel!

419
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,358
The rule of man is over.
Now begins the rule of fire.

420
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,069
-[howls] Oh, why?
-Jessica, no.

421
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,487
I will no longer be shackled

422
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,115
by the civilized society
of the above ground.

423
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,869
This is Underground,
and the only law here is flame.

424
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,914
The fire wants not for justice.
The fire wants not for reason.

425
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,668
-The fire desires only to be fed!
-Feed the fire!

426
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,880
-The fire is my new god!
-[moans] Oh, God!

427
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,716
I'm so sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter,
but the tide has turned

428
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,676
and I side with the fire now.

429
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,179
Tonight, we dine on Zach Braff.

430
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,182
-Tomorrow, canine cuisine!
-No.

431
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,225
You, take him to his spot,
and make him stay.

432
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,810
-[squawks]
-No! No! Please!

433
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,937
Listen to reason... this time!

434
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,065
[gulps] Ah-hh!

435
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,317
I think that's all of it.

436
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,528
I can't go back to my old life sober.
It's so empty.

437
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,947
Okay, okay.
Here's the secret to being happy.

438
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,699
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

439
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,620
Just pretend you are happy, and eventually
you'll forget you're pretending.

440
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,746
Maybe you're right.

441
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,790
I just need to stop complaining
and work harder.

442
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,543
Everyone else is doing it.
Why am I so special?

443
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,378
-[door bangs]
-Lock him in here!

444
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,715
-Please! Diane, my sweet wife.
-What's going on?

445
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,633
Marvin Gaye.

446
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,219
The People of Underground
have a new god, the fire.

447
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,138
And for my crimes
I will be fed to its ravenous flames.

448
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,974
My only hope is the meat
of Zach Braff proves lasting,

449
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,894
but I fear by daybreak,
there will be no Braff meat left.

450
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,939
-What's going on?
-Four Non-Blondes.

451
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,398
Everybody out except the prisoner.

452
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,025
-[Diane] No!
-Easy on the merchandise!

453
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,109
Get off me!

454
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,031
Well, it's been a tough week,
lots of back and forth,

455
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,201
but I think we've reached an agreement
that meets everybody's needs.

456
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,495
"The queen will share
male sex servants with the soldiers

457
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,622
for one night of magnificent,
sensuous splendor,

458
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,499
a gorgeous bacchanal
of hedonistic delights,

459
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,669
with a second orgy pickup option,
pursuant on success of the first."

460
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,878
[hissing]

461
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,964
My clients are satisfied with those terms.

462
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,133
Great. Now can we please return
to the surface world?

463
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,678
All my favorite clouds are up there.

464
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:07,140
Oh, I like this one.
He's got moxie and a soft thorax.

465
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:11,645
How did you find your fleshy self
in my kingdom, you pink marshmallow?

466
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,189
We were at this big
Beverly Hills fundraiser.

467
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,609
There was an earthquake,
and now everyone's trapped underground.

468
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,696
Did you say Beverly Hills?
Ugh! Of course.

469
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,365
Surface dwellers are always moving in
on our territory.

470
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,285
First they move here, then taxes go up,

471
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,578
the next thing you know,
there's a Whole Foods.

472
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,914
How am I supposed to concentrate
on a great orgy

473
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,958
when I've got gentrification on my mind?

474
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,877
No, we've got to get
those interlopers out of here.

475
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,046
-Let's--
-Hey! Hold on.

476
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,012
-Uh...
-[Jessica] Mr. Peanutbutter,

477
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,473
did you or did you not tell us
we could eat whatever we wanted?

478
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,683
[all] Peanutbutter!

479
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,644
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!
Peanutbutter!

480
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,979
We gotta do something.

481
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,065
Mr. Peanutbutter's the only non-shitty
thing that's ever happened to me

482
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,900
and now they're gonna set him on fire.

483
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,486
Okay. What would non-hungover Diane do?
She's smart.

484
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,405
I don't know. I need water.

485
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,991
There is no more water.
That's the problem.

486
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:06,908
"Choodwuck" is right.

487
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,496
Wait, isn't there water, under the ground?
Like, a well?

488
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,959
-Yeah! And we're underground.
-If we dig, we'll get water!

489
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:20,172
-Do not dig. The ground is very volatile.
-Quiet, sky rodent! To the shovels!

490
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,051
Mr. Peanutbutter, your time is nigh.

491
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,054
Any last words
before we light you on fire?

492
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:31,058
Yes, if I could just say,
"Don't light me on fire"?

493
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:35,771
The fire bends to no man's will.
Nothing can defeat the fire. Only--

494
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,855
[Diane] Water!

495
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,107
[Jessica] What? [gasps]

496
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,569
-Oh, wow, it's really water.
-Water is stronger than fire.

497
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,863
Wait, let's not really forget how-- ugh!

498
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,406
Water is my new god now!

499
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,366
Oh, boy.

500
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,410
-Clear gold!
-All right, water!

501
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,247
H-2-Oh, boy, we hit the freaking jackpot!

502
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,333
Hang on. It's-- it's not stopping.

503
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,168
Which is great!

504
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,253
You hit a pipe, you drunken imbeciles.

505
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,047
H-2-Oh, no!

506
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,133
[guests whimpering]

507
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,303
Well, I guess this is it.

508
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,973
-[bangs]
-Oh, God! It's another earthquake!

509
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,975
[all screaming]

510
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,104
How is this happening?

511
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,774
[ants] Heave! Heave! Heave!

512
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,984
Get them out of here!

513
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,445
Okay.

514
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,281
No! Please! I'm important down here!

515
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,408
[guests]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

516
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,912
[crashes]

517
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:40,502
Oh, what an eyesore.
The HOA will be hearing about this.

518
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:47,843
We are never talking
about any of this ever again. Whew.

519
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,762
So I will see you tomorrow.
We've got a rally in Bakersfield

520
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,306
and then we're touring
a tennis ball factory in Modesto.

521
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,558
Okay.

522
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,227
-Hi.
-Hi.

523
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,229
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

524
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,356
-I don't tell you that enough.
-It's okay.

525
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,734
If this governor thing
is really important to you...

526
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,654
It's not. You saw me in there.
I'm a terrible leader.

527
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,323
I don't want to be governor.
I just wanted people to like me.

528
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,200
Well, I like you.

529
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,036
Come on, Diane, let's go home...

530
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,496
oh, right.

531
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,290
Well, thanks for inviting me
to your party.

532
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,251
I had a wonderful time.
Evening really flew by.

533
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,169
Sure.

534
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,258
-You guys hungry?
-I could eat.

535
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,052
-Ethiopian?
-Ooh, haven't done Ethiopian in a while.

536
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,972
I should go home.
I haven't seen my boyfriend in ten days.

537
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,348
He's probably worried about me.

538
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,935
I'm down for Ethiopian.
I love that sponge bread.

539
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,688
-What do they call it, "injera"?
-Yeah, injera.

540
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,107
-Injera, right.
-That's right.

541
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,651
Yeah, that's good bread.
