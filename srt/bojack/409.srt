00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,849
Class, settle down. Settle down.

2
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,852
It's Ruthie's turn
to present her ancestor.

3
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,521
-Go ahead, Ruthie.
-Okay, Teach-Bot.

4
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,857
-Mrs. Teach-Bot.
-Ugh.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,152
My great-great-great grandmother
was called Princess Carolyn.

6
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,529
She was an agent
and a manager in Hollywoo.

7
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,449
What's the difference
between an agent and a manager?

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,284
Both look to find projects
for their clients

9
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,660
but only managers can produce.

10
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,620
-[class murmuring]
-What?

11
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,833
My mom told me that I come
from a long line of strong female cats.

12
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,628
Princess Carolyn was the runt of 12
and it made her one of the toughest.

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,506
Mom said, "She could take a lickin'
and keep on tickin'."

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,717
This expression refers to clocks,

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,260
an old fashioned way of timekeeping

16
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,846
{\an8}before we all universally accepted
the bean system.

17
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,599

"The bean system is the way."

18
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,434
For Ancestry Day, I'm gonna tell you

19
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,103
a particular story
about one particular day

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:06,024
on which Princess Carolyn faced
and overcame particular adversity

21
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:10,236
all the way back in the year 2017.

25
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,789
Sorry I can't go with you
to the doctor.

26
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,333
-Don't worry about it. I feel great!
-Today is crucial.

27
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,210
Stilton Cards has to create
its own holiday

28
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,836

when you open them.

31
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,760
I just know you're gonna be
the next Joey K. Easter,

32
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,053
the guy who invented Arbor Day.

33
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,222
How about
"National Friend of a Friend Day?"

34
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,516
-Is that anything?
-You'll think of something.

35
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,767
[slurps]
Mm!

36
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,686
Give me just a sip of the coffee.
I can have a sip.

37
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,815
-One sip.
-Today is going to be great.

38
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,316
Oh--!

Nah, maybe too clever.

"Go for BoJack!" Or maybe--

53
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,280
Ugh, stop!
You need to get a new agent.

54
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,781
I'm sick of fielding your offers.

55
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,618
{\an8}Offers? Well, you tell them
that I am not doing another reality show.

56
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,577
{\an8}So degrading.

57
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,997
{\an8}All they had at craft services
was Kirkland snacks, P.C. <i>Kirkland snacks.</i>

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,667
Well, first of all, I don't work for you,
so I'm not gonna tell anyone anything.

59
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,878
But, second,
these are actually good offers.

60
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,963
-Really? Like what?
-I'm not telling you because--

61
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,758
Got it. Busy, busy. I'm busy too,
so I'll call you back later. Bye.

{\an8}-<i>Don't call. I don't work for you!</i>
-How's this for a headline for the blog?

63
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,722
{\an8}You write about this, quote,
"BoJack Finally Solves Mystery

{\an8}I still don't understand your plan,
or how that's a headline.

67
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,398
The plan couldn't be simpler.
Go to the county courthouse,

68
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,068
ask to see all the birth certificates
on file, find Hollyhock's,

69
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,653
see what it says in the "mother" spot.

70
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,905
They're not just gonna give you
the birth certificates.

71
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,407
{\an8}Well, I gotta try something.
I have this girl at my house

72
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,534
{\an8}who came to me for help,
I want to do right by her.

73
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,370
{\an8}I just don't know
if you've thought through--

74
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,915
{\an8}Diane, I am a famous.
They will give me the birth certificate.

75
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,251
{\an8}Everyone gives me everything I want
all the time.

76
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,004
{\an8}It is an existential curse,
but a huge day-to-day convenience.

77
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,757
-So why do you need me?
-I don't know. Just wanted some company.

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,218
You told me to use a vacation day
because this was, quote,

79
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,095
"a feminism-related emergency."

80
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,806

-Why didn't you just bring Hollyhock?

into counting her teeth this morning,

82
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,811
{\an8}didn't want to leave the house.
You know how teens are.

83

Ruthie, this was supposed to be
about your ancestor.

00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:37,151
-Who are all these other "chara-ca-ters"?
-They fill out the world.

00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,404
Well, can you try
to keep things focused, please?

86
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,655
Okay, okay, okay.

87
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,658
[Ruthie] <i>Princess Carolyn had been</i>

She had a lot of former lovers.

Princess Carolyn, hi! Love the dress.

102
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,029
Is it new, or something I've seen you wear
literally hundreds of times?

[Ruthie] <i>Normally, Princess Carolyn</i>

104

<i>no longer had any power over her.</i>

<i>not only to be a better agent,</i>

107

<i>to try and have it all.</i>

108
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:40,298
<i>Princess Carolyn wanted to tell her</i>
<i>thank you, but instead she said...</i>

-Oh, I--

Right before his comeback?

and her nuptials
turning into "nope-tials,"

118

Oh, just give me one more chance.

The 1940's corpse who learns accordion?
It sounds so ludicrous.

125
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:30,264
You did play the short-sighted seamstress
in <i>The Storm on Northern Fortress.</i>

[groans] Aw.

Oh, uh--

132
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,742
-It's decaf, ma'am.
-Thanks, Judah.

133
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,911
You know, one year ago,
a setback like this

134
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,454
would have really spun me out.

135
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,705
But I don't need Courtney.

136
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,084
Every time we fall, we get back up
stronger and better than ever.

-Can I get a hallelujah?
-Is that a sort of pressed juice?

138
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,172
I'll have one hallelujah
on your desk by 12:45.

139
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,215
Great. What's next?

140
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,009
I noticed your necklace was broken,
so I pushed back your appointment,

141
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,636
and found a reputable jeweler nearby.

142

Oh, God, I'm sorry.
That came out horribly.

144
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,934
Not to speak above my station,

145
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,563
but perhaps it would behoove us to entice
BoJack Horseman back into our stable.

146
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,814
-Ugh!
-I'm sorry, ma'am.

147
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,858
"Stable" and "behoove"
were poor word choices.

148
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,277
I was not trying to engage in punnery
during business hours,

149
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,738
but we've received 15 more inquiries
about BoJack just this morning,

150
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,617
and I don't think it's wise to look
a gift... opportunity in the mouth.

151
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,204
BoJack is off the table.
We're a small management company.

152
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,206
We just need to focus
on the clients we have.

153
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,374
[Judah] You know best.

-I was done.

00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,937
but right now, I have to help my former
political rival defeat my two ex-wives.

161
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,981
One of whom is in the pocket
of powerful lobbyists

162
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,941
and the other of whom
murdered popular actor

163
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,694
and soundtrack artisan, Zach Braff,
and ate his burnt flesh!

164
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,446
Politics as usual, right?

165
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,114
Well, when you're ready to work again--

166
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,908
Gotta go. They need all hands on deck,

167
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,076
because Woodchuck
lost his hands underground

168
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,454
and they replaced them
with creepy lobster claws.

169
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,914
Typical politics!

170
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,379
Hey. So I need this clasp replaced,
24-karat gold.

171
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,674
This is a priceless family heirloom.

172
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,344
Princess Carolyn had gotten her necklace
from her mother,

173
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,222
who got it from <i>her </i>mother,
who brought it from the old country.

174
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,808
<i>When our ancestors first emigrated</i>
<i>to America, they were very poor.</i>

175
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,020
<i>Back in the Motherland,</i>
<i>they had been doctors and engineers,</i>

176
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,189
<i>but here, they struggled to find work.</i>

177
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,067
<i>Every night, they would sing the song</i>
<i>of the old country,</i>

178
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,861
<i>hoping to reclaim the glory of those days.</i>

<i>But she never sold that necklace,</i>

186
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,802

<i>she could give her daughter.</i>

187
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,222

188
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,934
and stick-to-itiveness
that has for generations led my family

189
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,936
to always land on their feet.

190
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,398
-You can come back in about two hours.
-Thank you.

-Sorry, sorry! Wait. Sorry, sorry.

-[clatters]
-Okay, okay, okay.

193
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,030
I'm just looking
for something really nice.

194
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,867
This is for a sexy catfish
I met on the Internet.

195
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,120
-Charley?
-Princess Carolyn!

196
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:43,249
-You work at a jewelry store now?
-No, I own my own management company.

197
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,834
Oh, yeah. Good for you.

198
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,419
I'm so proud of you.

199
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,004
Your approval means nothing to me.

200
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,132
So I guess it's good you said "no"
to my offer last year.

201
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,844
What offer? I mean, exactly what offer
are you talking about?

202
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,220
I get so many.

203
00:09:56,304 --> 00:10:01,809
Last year, I reached out to your guy...
I wanna say, "Ju-do"...

204
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,520
-Judah.
-This guy's name was Judo.

205
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,106
I offered to buy VIM
and merge it with Vigor.

206
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,484
We would have called
the new company, VIMgor.

207
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,945
Oh, right. That offer.

208
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,156
I couldn't believe
when he said you weren't interested.

209
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,826
Well, yeah. Because I wasn't,
and he does what I say.

210
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,579
So I guess it all worked out for everyone.

211
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,414
You got to start over as a manager,

212
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,500
and instead of buying VIM,
I bought the Utah Jazz.

213
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,961
They're terrible agents,
but they're getting better.

214
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,088
-Yeah.
-Anyway, nice bumping into--

215
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,882
-Oh, sorry.
-Careful, please. Ooh.

216
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,383
-[Charley] Oopsie. Oh, boy.
-No, no.

217
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,926
-[crashes]
-Is that valuable? It is.

218
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,513
My great, great, great grandmother
was dismayed that her trusted colleague

219
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,848
had kept this from her.

220
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,809
<i>Her mind raced,</i>
<i>"Was Judah capable of deception?"</i>

221
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,312
<i>She hoped what Charley told her</i>
<i>wasn't true,</i>

222
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,732
<i>but her instincts told her</i>
<i>the frog wasn't smart enough to lie.</i>

223
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,777
First quarter, second quarter.
Wow, that's a lot of quarters.

224
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,278
Oh, excuse me. Hello.

225
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,823
Judah, you'll never guess
who I just ran into.

226
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,575
No, I won't. Very astute, ma'am.

227
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,787
-It was Charley Witherspoon!
-Mm-hmm.

228
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,164
-Char... ley...
-Hmm...? Hmm!

229
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,166
-Wither... spoon!
-Hmm.

230
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,877
-Okay.
-How does that make you feel?

231
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,712
That very short story
makes me feel nothing.

232
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,631
I don't think it's your fault
as a storyteller.

233
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,508
I often have trouble engaging
with narratives.

234
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,968
[Ruthie] <i>His lack of response</i>
<i>made her hope it wasn't true.</i>

235
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,970
<i>Could it all have been a misunderstanding</i>

236
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,348
<i>involving an enigmatic stranger</i>
<i>named "Judo"?</i>

237
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,518
So, what's next, then?

238
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,396
Ooh, I want to get the life rights
to that woman I saw on Instagram

239
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,605
who had a pretty coffee.

240
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:34,068
I bet we could attach Jessica Alba
and Jonathan Taylor-Thomas by lunch.

241
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,238
Okay, but I still don't understand
what a manager <i>is.</i>

242
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,865
Do they just say the names
of movies and actors?

243
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,659
How does that generate revenue?

244
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,702
No one knows, Torf. It's not important!

245
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,871
Be quiet, Torf. Take your Hush Pill.

246
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,873
Yes, Miss Teach--
[gulps]

247
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,333
Uh-hh...

248
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,503
-Continue your presentation, Ruthie.
-Thank you.

249
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,881
-And finally, Rob Lowe.
-Great idea, Princess Carolyn.

250
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,551
But is it possible you've forgotten
your doctor's appointment?

251
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,136
-Oh, fish!
-It's my fault.

252
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,721
I rescheduled it in an attempt
to make your life easier.

253
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,434
Thank you, Judah! I'll call you
if I think of any more actor names.

254
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,648
[sighs]
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

255
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,359
-God, this is taking forever.
-We've been waiting for 15 minutes.

256
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,735
I know. Let's just go home.

257
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,779
No, Diane.
How could you even suggest that?

258
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,823
This is not about us.
This is for my daughter.

259
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,199
-Ugh.
-I know what I have to do.

260
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,534
Excuse me, excuse me. Pardon me.

261
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,411
Important celebrity doing the right thing.

262
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,707
-Whoa, a famous guy!
-And he's doing the right thing?

263
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,918
This is like when George Clooney
married that less famous lady!

264
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,505
-Wait. Don't you mean Jurj Clooners?
-Who cares?

265
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,007
Hello, friend.

266
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,342
-Yes, it's me, BoJack Hor--
-Number?

267
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,470
I'm sorry, I don't give out
my personal phone number.

268
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:46,307
No, your number. You need a number
or I can't help you, BoJack Hor.

269
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,852
Horseman. It's Horseman.
I don't look familiar to you at all?

270
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,521
-Eh.
-Come on, BoJack. Let's get a number.

271
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,274
Wait a minute. You're Diane Nguyen!

272
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,693
I recognize you
from your <i>Girl Croosh </i>avatar.

273
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,613
I loved "Twenty Reasons
to Try the Diva Cup."

274
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:04,658
Oh, wow, thanks! You didn't think
20 was too many reasons?

275
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,412
-No way. Number 14 blew my mind!
-Didn't I say it would?

276
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,289
We don't have time.
Where do we get a number?

277
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,832
-That line.
-What?

278
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,001
And you'll need these-- [grunts]
forms.

279
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,504
Ow, paper cut! Who still uses paper?

280
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,339
Can't I just swipe an app or something?

281
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,300
-Bye, Diane! Keep up the great work!
-[giggles]

282
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,427
Oh, get over yourself.

283
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,849
-[sighs]
-[door opens]

284
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,852
-So? What's the prognosis?
-Hmm...

285
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,396
I'm trying to think of the best way
to put this.

286
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,148
As Charles Lindbergh would say,

287
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,443
"Sometimes you fly an airplane,
and sometimes you lose a baby."

288
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,654
In this case, you didn't fly the airplane.

289
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,780
Wait, what?

290
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,782
Your pregnancy is no longer viable.

291
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,118
Well, how do we make it viable again?

292
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,245
Mm-mm...

293
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,829
How did this happen?

294
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,830
Goodness, I don't know.

295
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,084
I wouldn't beat yourself up.
Miscarriages happen for so many reasons.

296
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:59,004
There's nothing medically wrong with you.
Maybe you just wanted the baby too much.

297
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,382
Maybe you didn't deserve it
because you were unkind once.

298
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:05,094
Maybe you ran afoul of a trickster god
or wood nymph who is now exacting revenge.

299
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,639
Oof!
This is... a lot.

300
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,809
Not for me. This is my job,
so... pretty regular day.

301
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,977
What do I do next?

302
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,646
Well, there's a procedure.
We can do it here later this week.

303
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,731
You want Darlene to call someone
to drive you home?

304
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,651
No, I'm okay. I don't need anyone.

305
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:24,572
You're a real tough broad.
Except for, you know, the uterus area.

306
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,698
Pretty weak.

307
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,451
[gasps]

308
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,497
-Hey, is my necklace ready?
-Oh, I was going to call you.

309
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,916
When I was working on your necklace,
I realized something.

310
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,710
-Oh?
-It's not actually gold,

311
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,254
it's just gold plated. See?

312
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,923
No, it's very expensive.

313
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,509
It's pretty, but basically worthless.

314
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,803
And I'm only saying it's pretty
to make you feel better.

315
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,349
But, it's from the old country.
It's been in my family for generations.

316
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,811
No, this is costume jewelry
from J.C. Penney.

317
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,981
Circa 1963.
Somebody just told you a story.

318
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,066
-I'm sorry.
-Wha-- huh?

319
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:07,156
So, do you still want a 24-karat gold
clasp on this garbage necklace, or...?

320
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,577

you'd feel like you had to say yes.

-And perhaps your emotions--
-No.

If I can't trust you,
then I can't work with you.

BoJack, let's go home.

No, I would like to register
a formal complaint.

-How do I do that?
-Complaints are on the eighth floor.

in line 12-B on the third floor.

00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,745
Trying to process
what you threw at me.

487
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,206
It's gonna be fine.
I'll be pregnant again in no time.

488
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,459
I'm so sorry. Let me take you home.

489
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,294
-When you're ready to try again--
-I'm ready!

490
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,337
I said I was ready.

491
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,881
So we'll go back to the doctor,
maybe talk about other options.

492
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,426
I don't need other options.
My mother had 12 kids.

493
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,221
My body was made for this.
We just gotta keep tick-tick-tickin'.

494
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,182
I know you wanna do this on your own,

495
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,142
but you've had two miscarriages now, and--

496
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,268
-Five!
-What?

497
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,437
I've had five miscarriages.

498
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,774
One last year, now one,
and three others before.

499
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,069
-But it's whatever. It's okay.
-Why didn't you tell me?

500
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,530
Are you kidding?
I don't want you looking at me like that.

501
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,657
Like that! I know I can do this.

502
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,868
You can't keep stuff like this from me.
It's not okay.

503
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,953
-It's not about you.
-It is. This is about us.

504
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,747
You're not allowed to be mad at me.

505
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,874
-This is my bad day.
-It's our bad day.

506
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,461
It's so easy for you...
to love me when everything's good.

507
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,545
Princess Carolyn, I...

508
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,880
-Let me take you home.
-No.

509
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,382
You need to live in this.
You need to get used to this,

510
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,886
because if you're serious about having
a baby with me, this could happen again.

511
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,012
Are you prepared for that?

512
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,890
This could happen five more times.
But I'm ready for that.

513
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,101
Because I want this.
Do you want it that bad?

514
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,685
[sighs]

515
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:20,440
I just think we should
maybe talk about other options.

516
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,984
Okay. Here's another option.

517
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,778
-Get out of my apartment!
-I'm sorry.

518
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,155
Get out! Save it for your next girlfriend.

519
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,742
The one you can take home to your parents.
The one who's <i>easy.</i>

520
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,038
Goodbye, Princess Carolyn.

521
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,418
[sighs]

522
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,964
[door opens]

523
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,517
-[cork squeaks]
-[ringtone plays]

524
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,227
-[beeps]
-What is it?

525
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,396
I'm calling about the offers.
I don't want to do 'em.

526
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,565
What's the point of being famous
if you wait in line?

527
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,441
<i>If you could politely decline</i>
<i>on my behalf--</i>

528
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,861
I do not work for you, BoJack!

529
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,947
I'm sorry. I started this all wrong.
How was your day?

530
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,200
-[moans] Well--
-<i>Because mine was awful.</i>

531
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,077
<i>I mean, truly, one for the books.</i>

532
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,204
Because I'm a good guy
trying to do the right thing.

533
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,956
First, I go for my breakfast Pinkberry,

534
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,625
which I had earned
because I had good intentions for today,

535
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,169
they're out of my favorite toppings!

536
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,713
<i>So I go across the street to Menchie's,</i>
<i>like some kind of hobo.</i>

537
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,590
[chuckles]
Mm-hmm.

538
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,551
At Menchie's, the stupid teen that
worked there raised her eyebrows at me.

539
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,303
"You kidding me?
You're trying to judge me?

540
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,889
You have very uneven eyebrows
and you work at a Menchie's."

541
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,641
<i>And don't even get me started</i>
<i>on the rancid internment camp</i>

542
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,143
<i>that is the L.A. County Courthouse.</i>

543
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,853
Hey, you wanna know what I do

544
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,189
when I have a really bad,
awful, terrible day?

545
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,106
<i>What?</i>

546
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,568
I imagine my great-great-great
granddaughter in the future

547
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,403
talking to her class about me.

548
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,448
She's poised and funny,
and tells people about me

549
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,283
and how everything worked out
in the end.

550
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,035
And when I think about that,

551
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,787
I think about how everything's
going to work out.

552
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,789
Because how else could she tell people?

553
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,959
But it's... fake.

554
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,754
Yeah, well... it makes me feel better.
