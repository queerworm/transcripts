00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,329
"I'm Roger Dangerfield."

176
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,748
[laughs]
No respect, indeed.

177
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,959
Todd, you got the job.

178
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,502
Oh.

179
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,713
Can you believe this weather
we're having?

180
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,591
No, I cannot believe
this weather we're having!

181
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,093
[laughs]

182
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,178
Oh, wow.
We make a great pair.

183
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:12,057
It's like I'm Miss Daisy,
and you're Minnie Driver.

184
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,935
[lawn mower rattling]

185
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,603
- [phone beeps]
- Hey, I'm bored.

186
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,605
And I think Todd swallowed
a cyanide pill

187
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,814
and might be dead.

188
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,066
Wanna come over
and bang it out?

189
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,609
Appealing as that sounds,

190
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,485
I have lunch plans
with Vincent.

191
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,487
I know that might be hard
for you to hear.

192
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,990
Wait, that guy from the bar
who is actually three boys

193
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,118
stacked on top of each other
under a trench coat?

194
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,161
Well, don't fly into
a jealous rage about it.

195
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,246
Not jealous.

196
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,705
Just reminding you that
you are trying

197
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,207
to have a relationship
with someone who is--

198
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,375
and again, it's bizarre

199
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,543
I should have to point
this out-- three young boys

200
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,837
<i>stacked on top of each other</i>
<i>under a trench coat.</i>

201
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,923
He listens to me.

202
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,633
Okay, okay, but can
you just acknowledge that--

203
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,968
- That you are being jealous?
- Oh, oh!

204
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,303
- [glass shatters]
- Already acknowledged.

205
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,887
- Toodles.
- [phone beeps]

206
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,056
- Look who's not dead.
- Better than not dead.

207
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,268
You are looking at
Mr. Peanutbutter's new driver.

208
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,561
You're his driver?
That's perfect.

209
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,522
Now you can infiltrate
Mr. Peanutbutter's inner circle.

210
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,358
I don't know, BoJack.

211
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,609
Sure, you'll act
all friendly,

212
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,403
gain his trust,
chauffer him around

213
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,613
on his little errands
to the groomer and whatnot,

214
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,782
but all the while,
you'll be studying him,

215
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,575
scouring out his weaknesses,

216
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,454
biding your time
till we're ready to strike.

217
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,039
And once you zero in
on his Achilles' heel,

218
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:22,294
we will take... him... down.

219
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,213
Hooray. Betrayal.

220
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,092
[warbling]

221
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,385
Oh, man. Oh, man.

222
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,803
- Keep it cool, Todd.
- Hey, pal.

223
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,638
If you're making
small talk up there,

224
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,099
how about sending
a little my way?

225
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,060
Um... can you believe
this weather we're having?

226
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:43,731
No, I cannot believe
this weather we're having!

227
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,110
[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

228
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,195
Hey, weren't you supposed
to be here

229
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,696
like a half hour ago?

230
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,240
Yeah, I've just been
sitting in my car.

231
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,574
[chuckles]

232
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,576
Listen, I was looking
over my notes,

233
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,704
and I think I have enough
to go write the book,

234
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,958
so...
I'm just going to do that.

235
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,960
You don't want
to interview me anymore?

236
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,879
But don't you want to know
what my Rosebud is?

237
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,006
You told me repeatedly
it was the nudie magazine

238
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,716
your uncle showed you
with the three-nippled woman.

239
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,718
- Who was she?
- I got it all.

240
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,844
Oh, okay.

241
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,721
Well, I'll see you
around though, right?

242
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,307
Yeah.
I, um--

243
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,185
Why did you have to make
things weird, BoJack?

244
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,604
[car door opens, closes]

245
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,024
I made things weird?

246
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,901
[Mr. Peanutbutter]<i> </i>So if you see anything

247
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,736
you know we need,
like this biscuit warmer,

248
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,654
you just run the laser
over the barcode,

249
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,739
- and kablamsky!
- [beep]

250
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,157
It goes in the registry.

251
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,700
And that way, everybody knows
what I want.

252
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,411
- And I know what I want.
- Uh...

253
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,870
Which is what everyone wants.

254
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,247
And it's really clear,

255
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,873
and nobody's confused
about anything.

256
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,543
Am I crazy,
or are you not into this?

257
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,794
No, I am. It's just--
[sighs]

258
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,756
The big wedding in Nantucket,
all these presents--

259
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,632
I'm so overwhelmed,
I can barely consider

260
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,135
whether I want or need
a biscuit warmer,

261
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,012
which I think is how people
end up with biscuit warmers.

262
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,181
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

263
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,974
Close your eyes.
Come on.

264
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,768
Okay, picture
our lives together.

265
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,145
It's a cold Sunday morning
a bunch of years from now.

266
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,314
Maybe robots have taken over,
maybe they haven't.

267
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,441
I don't know.
It's the future.

268
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,025
This story isn't about that.

269
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,985
The important thing is
it's Sunday morning.

270
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,530
I brought you the paper,
fetched your slippers.

271
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,741
You come into the kitchen--
Can you smell biscuits?

272
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,160
- Yes.
- So can I.

273
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,787
- Are they warm?
- Yeah.

274
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,872
Well, that's all
a biscuit warmer's for.

275
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,791
Look, if marriage
stresses you out,

276
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,418
we don't have to get married.

277
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:27,919
It's not the marriage.

278
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,589
It's the wedding
and the year of build-up.

279
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,090
So forget all that.

280
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,300
I've done
the whole big wedding thing.

281
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,759
I don't need to do it again.

282
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,511
Let's do something
small and casual

283
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,096
right here in town
next month.

284
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,432
Honestly,
that would be amazing.

285
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,183
But we'd have to cancel
the doves,

286
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,684
and we wouldn't be able
to send out

287
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,186
those fancy invitations
you liked.

288
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,230
Those doves were being
jerks anyway.

289
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,023
And invitations--
They're just a scam

290
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,485
made up by the Post Office
to keep tabs on us.

291
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,693
Post Office.

292
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,529
- [growls]
- Settle down, boy.

293
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,657
[Todd] And then we talked about
his favorite Smash Mouth CDs.

294
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,909
[crunching]
And-- Oh, oh.

295
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,204
And then that led to a whole
conversations about sticks.

296
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,248
Oh, and let me tell you,

297
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:09,503
Mr. Peanutbutter has got some
serious opinions about sticks.

298
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,045
Why are you telling me this?

299
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,671
What? You said
you wanted every detail.

300
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,174
Did I mention
he got a new bandana?

301
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,509
Give me something
I can use

302
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,010
to make them call off
their wedding.

303
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,595
Oh, yeah.
Did I not tell you?

304
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,804
They called off their wedding.

305
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,680
What? Thank God!

306
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,808
Oh, the universe makes sense.

307
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,602
They decided against
a big destination wedding,

308
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,811
so they're doing it here

309
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,062
- sometime next month.
- What?

310
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,648
I guess saying
they called it off

311
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,982
is probably not right.

312
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,066
[groans]

313
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,319
[ominous music]

314
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,736
Hey, what's this?

315
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,822
Oh, yes,
I got jury duty,

316
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,157
but I can't worry
about that right now.

317
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,699
That is a problem for
Friday BoJack.

318
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,036
Now think, Todd.
Gotta have something I can use

319
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,580
sloshing around in that
pot-infused Jell-O shot

320
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,457
- you call a brain.
- Let's see.

321
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,085
Mr. Peanutbutter likes having
his tummy scratched,

322
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,087
and Diane's family
is from Vietnam,

323
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,466
which is where Vietnamese food
comes from,

324
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,843
and since that goes
in your tummy--

325
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,470
Okay, stop thinking.
Just give me raw data.

326
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,680
What's happening this week?

327
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,390
Well, the circus
is in town.

328
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,266
Congress is going to vote
on the new Education Bill--

329
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,685
With Mr. Peanutbutter!

330
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,019
What's happening
with Mr. Peanutbutter?

331
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,313
Well, I'm taking
Diane and him

332
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,981
to the bank on Thursday.

333
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,109
I can use that.
I can actually use that.

334
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,363
I don't know if I'm up

335
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,657
for staging
a bank robbery, BoJack.

336
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,826
Oh, come on, character
actress Margo Martindale.

337
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,036
They say that there are
no good parts

338
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,413
for women over 50.

339
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,706
I want to stick an AK-47

340
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,416
in your hand
and prove them wrong.

341
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,209
I do tire of the limitations

342
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,002
of stage, film,
and television.

343
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,879
You might as well perform
in a cage, am I right?

344
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,339
This is guerilla theater--

345
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,425
No stage, no script, no net.

346
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,134
It's the kind of work
we talked about

347
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,136
doing that night
in the desert.

348
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,723
Don't tell me we left
those dreams in the sweat lodge.

349
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,683
- Hell, I'll do it.
- [dishes clatter]

350
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,520
And that little boy
never found his mother.

351
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,563
Hey, guys.

352
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,064
BoJack Horseman?

353
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,441
Oh. Hi.

354
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,734
What a weird coincidence.

355
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,318
I did not know
you would be here today.

356
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,613
How are... things?

357
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:00,988
Things are good.
You?

358
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,407
Things good with you?

359
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,658
Hands behind your head,
everybody.

360
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,993
Nobody moves,
nobody gets shot.

361
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,246
- [gasps]
- What an unfortunate surprise.

362
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,457
Well, well,
isn't that a pretty ring?

363
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,958
- [gasps]
- [coughs] This one.

364
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,335
Well, well,
isn't that a pretty ring?

365
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,712
I'll take it.

366
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,088
But it's
my engagement ring.

367
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,423
Give it to her, Diane.

368
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,133
- It's just a ring.
- Just a ring?

369
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,427
That ring is a symbol
of your love.

370
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,262
If you don't care
about the ring,

371
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,306
it really makes me wonder
if you care about

372
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,015
the woman wearing it.

373
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,350
That terrifying bank robber

374
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,311
is making
some very cogent points.

375
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,937
No, Mr. Peanutbutter's right.

376
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,315
If the ring is
just a symbol for love,

377
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,691
why would I need a symbol

378
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,401
when I have the real thing
right here?

379
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,570
Yeah, we don't need rings,
we have each other.

380
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,197
Hey, why are we even waiting
a month to get married?

381
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,784
If anything, this bank robbery
is reminding me

382
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,410
that life is short.

383
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,953
We should get married
even sooner!

384
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,163
[softly]
No...

385
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,331
What do you mean sooner?

386
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,499
Why not this weekend?

387
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,375
We could get married Saturday.

388
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,669
Am I crazy?

389
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,420
[softly]
Yes. Don't do it.

390
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,047
- Oh, keep the damn thing.
- Aw.

391
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,299
[applause]

392
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,384
Okay.
Saturday it is.

393
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,719
What the hell
just happened?

394
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,680
Something truly beauti--

395
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,806
Aah!

396
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,056
- Oh.
- Get your hands off me!

397
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,141
- [Taser crackles]
- Uh-oh.

398
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,726
[landing blows]

399
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,979
[laughs]
Long story short,

400
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,690
Erica did have to lose
the foot,

401
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,066
but she gained a friend.

402
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,943
Sorry, kind of went off
on a tangent there.

403
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,487
Diane and I
wanna thank you all

404
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,905
for coming to our
impromptu rehearsal dinner,

405
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,783
even though
we did not actually have time

406
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,035
- to organize a rehearsal.
- Or a dinner.

407
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,329
But there is an open bar...

408
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,789
[cheers and applause]

409
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,415
which you are
all welcome to partake in

410
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,250
as soon as I finish
this toast,

411
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,629
which I will be doing right...

412
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,005
after one more quick anecdote.

413
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,465
- [guests groan]
- It was winter in Prague,

414
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,300
and the consumption hung low
in the air.

415
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,510
Well, the bank thing
was a dud.

416
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,845
Thanks a lot, Todd.

417
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,304
Well, you win some,
you lose some.

418
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,806
It's like Vincent always says--

419
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,182
- "Oopsy."
- Vincent?

420
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,600
Yeah,
Princess Carolyn's boyfriend.

421
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,185
We've hung out
a couple times.

422
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,978
- What are you ta--
- That dude is funny.

423
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,689
You know he's not
a person, right?

424
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:58,981
Look, I don't want to get

425
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,191
in the middle
of your whole thing

426
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,442
with Princess Carolyn.

427
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,777
It's not about that.

428
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,028
I just don't understand
why nobody else

429
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,572
seems to notice
that she is dating a man

430
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,031
who is clearly
three little boys

431
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,116
doing the thing
from <i>The Little Rascals.</i>

432
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,077
Oh, that reminds me
of another funny story.

433
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,120
[clinks glass]
If I could say a few words?

434
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,456
BoJack Horseman.
Take the mic.

435
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,833
Spin us a yarn.

436
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,459
Mr. Peanutbutter, Diane.

437
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,002
Since I am friends
with both of you

438
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,046
- and have no ulterior motives...
- Mm-hmm.

439
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,464
I would like to offer
my restaurant

440
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,883
as a venue for your wedding.

441
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,551
Wow! Really?

442
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,511
I don't know.
That's too generous.

443
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,639
Hey, don't look a horse's gift
in the mouth, right?

444
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:32,849
[laughter]

445
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,975
I get it.
Like the song.

446
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,060
That's not a song.

447
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,478
All right, everyone.

448
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,730
That's it for the toasts.

449
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,524
Enjoy yourselves
and each other.

450
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,484
[dance music plays]

451
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,027
This is perfect.

452
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,780
Now that the wedding's
at my restaurant,

453
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,740
we have
the home field advantage.

454
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,324
Perfect for sabotage.

455
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,493
BoJack,
I need to thank you.

456
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,704
You calling me to the bar
the other night

457
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,996
turned out to be
the best thing

458
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,164
that ever happened to me.

459
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,708
- I think I'm in love.
- Okay.

460
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,293
This "person"
you're in love with--

461
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,044
Have you seen him
without his trench coat on?

462
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,838
I don't understand why
you can't be happy for me.

463
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,423
He's a good boyfriend.

464
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,007
I actually think
you and Vincent

465
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,260
would really hit it off
if you gave him a chance.

466
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,178
You should spend some
one-on-one time with him.

467
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,597
You mean one-on-three time?

468
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,265
Because
there are three of him.

469
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,183
We get it.
You don't like him.

470
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,727
I'm actually not sure
you do get it.

471
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,230
- [unzips]
- I know what's been going on.

472
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,649
Ah!
I wasn't gonna pee.

473
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,066
I was just taking
my penis out.

474
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,777
You've been driving me around,

475
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,779
but there was something else
happening the whole time.

476
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:28,947
I see it now.

477
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,865
What are you
talking about?

478
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,868
You weren't just working
as my driver, Todd.

479
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,454
You were becoming my friend.

480
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,873
Oh, yeah.
That was happening.

481
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,875
Well, I could use a friend
right about now.

482
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,877
There's something I really
gotta get off my chest,

483
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:46,506
and if it got out, it could
destroy the whole wedding.

484
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,049
No, I'm not great
with sensitive information.

485
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,093
I don't know if I'm ready
to get married again.

486
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,013
Don't get me wrong.
I love Diane so much.

487
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,181
I didn't have any doubts

488
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,433
until I realized
she had doubts.

489
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,811
Then I figured
she's smarter than I am.

490
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,228
Maybe she knows things
I don't.

491
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,730
You are kind of unloading

492
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,774
a lot of sensitive information here.

493
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,860
Sure, I think I'm ready
to commit to Diane,

494
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,111
but I can't even commit
to my favorite type of stick.

495
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,448
Yes, today, it's short
and knobby, but tomorrow?

496
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,117
Well, sure, Diane is short,
but I don't know about knobby.

497
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,203
The last thing I want to do
is hurt Diane,

498
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,497
but I keep having this dream
where she's gone.

499
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,207
There's no break-up,
no tragedy.

500
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,668
She's just gone, and my life
continues without her.

501
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,419
And it terrifies me
to say this,

502
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,297
but in the dream I feel...
relief.

503
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,842
Hey, thanks for listening
to all this.

504
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,593
You're
a really good friend, Todd.

505
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,261
[groans]

506
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,263
Since you weren't able
to give me any useful intel,

507
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,016
I had to offer up
my restaurant,

508
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,267
but now, we're on my turf.

509
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,770
Time for operation "I don't."

510
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,647
Yeah, sounds good.

511
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:45,940
You know, with my knack

512
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,108
for coming up with plans
and your ability

513
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,527
to hear them
without contributing

514
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,237
more than three words
at a time,

515
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,989
we make a pretty good team,
don't we, Todd?

516
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,115
- You said it.
- See?

517

00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,166

<i>The answer might surprise you.</i>

I know her, but how?
Wait.

525
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,468
She was
at the convenience store

526
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,262
the night I bought
that video game

527
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,222
and ruined my rock opera.

528
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,974
<i>She's the one who asked me</i>

529
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,102
<i>to hand her that tape</i>
<i>from the 10¢ bin.</i>

530
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:27,774
[gasps] That means
Margo Martindale likes tapes!

531
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,734
And a tape is something
you listen to,

532
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,569
but tape is also
a sticky thing

533
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,529

534
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,032
Boxes is

535
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,701
What does it all mean?

536
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,578
Am I just grasping
at straws?

537
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,831
Wait.
Straws-- That's it.

538
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:47,334
Straws are used
to drink soda or water,

539
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,962
and plants need water.

540
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:53,424
And BoJack used Margo Martindale
as a plant

541
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:58,304
at the bank
and the convenience store,

542
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,890
which means--
Ugh!

543
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,851
BoJack hired Margo Martindale

544
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,853
to make me find
that video game

545
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:10,108
so he could kill
my rock opera!

546
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,609
Aw, dude.

547
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,573
- Rise and shine, Todd.
- I didn't sleep.

548
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,283
Well, we're down to the wire,
but we still got

549
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,243
one more day to figure out
how to stop this wedding,

550
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,579

one second, so let's get--

551
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,581
Oh, shit.
Forgot about jury duty.

552
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,166
Damn you, Tuesday BoJack.

553
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:35,257
- And so, you saw the defendant.
- Yes.

554
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,137
That man, the defendant--
You saw him?

555
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,763
Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry up.

556
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,725
- That's correct.
- The defendant was seen by you.

557
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,977
Sweet Jesus.

558

But you know who
the real winner is?

568

- Mr. Peanutbutter.

I'm gonna find

576

the meanest, hardest queen bitch
of the yard,

577
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,147

her finger off.

I never understood why

586
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,454
it was so important to keep
those two apart.

587
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,956
I was just trying to be
a good friend

588
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,918

shitty, ass-backwards way.

589

Diane deserves the best.

She's smart

592

You don't need kooky schemes

Just go to her

No, I'm stupid.

But even I know
that the only reason

you're doing this is because
you're in love with Diane.

Look around.
This day is not about you, okay?

620
