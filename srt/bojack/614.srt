-[elevator dings]
-[men laughing]

2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,845
And that's the end of a sexist,
fatphobic anecdote

3
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,930
in which I was so desperate
to get out of the rain,

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,559
-I slept with a plus-sized woman.
-[laughter continues]

5
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:18,935
[woman] Hold the door.

6
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:22,105
-Oh! Did I miss a meeting?
-No, Angela.

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,358
We took Davey here out
for a big '90s-style birthday party,

8
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,735
it being the '90s and all...

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:30,030
I would have come!
I love the '90s, and it being them.

10
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,450
Come on, the president of the network
shouldn't fraternize with the board.

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,952
Let your number two handle that stuff.

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,455
-[elevator dings]
-[laughter continues]

13
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,666
I don't like you going to birthday parties
behind my back, Teddy.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,418
I was doing reconnaissance for you!

15
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,502
You didn't hear it from me,

16
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,297
but there's some concern
that as a single career gal, you're,

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,507
-well, a single career gal.
-And?

18
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,926
ABC's supposed to be
a family network.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,179
I understand families.

20
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,555
Uh-huh.

21
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,473
Does he?

22
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,018
Oh, Herb. [sighs]

23
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,563
[Herb] I'm sorry, okay?

24
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,065
It's called discretion, Herb.

25
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,233
We're trying to sell
the network to Disney.

26
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,445
Disney? You think Michael Eisner
gives a hoot who I go to bed with?

27
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,697
We don't need to bring Eisner into this.

28
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,991
Obviously,
Michael Eisner is a compassionate

29
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,659
and progressive individual.

30
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,952
This isn't about him.

31
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,580
-So, it's you. Just say it's you.
-No. You're the one--

32
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,166
If you're going to fire me,
at least have the balls to fire me.

33
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,793
-You're fired.
-Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,586
You think you can do
"Horsin' Around" without me?

35
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,130
We could do it without anybody.
All we need is the horse.

36
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,509
And that horse is just gonna go along
with you canning his best friend?

37
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,096
You want BoJack to betray me,
you're gonna need one hell of a pitch.

38
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,139
Okay.

39
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,058

-[knocking on door]

41
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,995
{\an8}-Mr. Horseman, you're invited to set?
-Thank you.

42
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,747
{\an8}-The set of "Horny Unicorn"?
-Yes, I'm aware.

43
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,708
To shoot a scene
in which the titular horny unicorn

44
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,209
gets his penis stuck in a saxophone,

45
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,336
because he was hoping to "get blown"?

46
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,046
{\an8}I know the scene, thank you.

47
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,593
{\an8}[slurps, gulps]

48
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,594
{\an8}Ah.

49
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,430
[phone rings, beeps]

50
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,347
Hello?

51
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,142
<i>-BoJack, this is Angela Diaz.</i>
-Huh?

52
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,393
<i>We met once before.</i>

53
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,273
I remember.

54
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:15,069
{\an8}I saw your interview several months back.
It made me nostalgic.

55
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,822
Me too. Nostalgic for the day
before I did the interview.

56
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,741
Oh, yes, humor. [chuckles]

57
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:24,120
{\an8}If you're free tonight, you could come by
the house, watch the fire, reminisce.

58
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,164
{\an8}There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

59
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,917
-What?
-<i>Wouldn't you love to find out?</i>

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,793
Uh...

61
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:37,300
{\an8}So, the Stephen King musical opened
right next door to the Sondheim revival.

62
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,385
{\an8}We have clients in both.
 I was worried there'd be tension,

63
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,846
{\an8}but it turns out <i>Misery</i> loves <i>Company.</i>

64
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,514
{\an8}Judah, are you in a band?

65
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,557
{\an8}Why do you ask that?

66
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,435
{\an8}I've always wondered if you were in a band
ever since this afternoon

67
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,979
{\an8}when I overheard Juniper tell Stuart
that you were in a band.

68
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,190
You're playing a gig tonight,
and the whole office is going.

69
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,776
{\an8}I was planning to invite you,
but didn't want you to feel obligated.

70
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,736
{\an8}-We're not good.
-[phone ringing]

71
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,738
{\an8}Lenny! How the shell are you?

72
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,864
I got trouble, PC!

73
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,866
You know Teddy Buttons,
my head of production?

74
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,576
I'm familiar with Teddy.

75
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,455
I somehow missed that Teddy has spent
the last 20 years showing women his...

76
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,165
I'm familiar.

77
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,792
See, that's why I love you.
You're discreet.

78
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,962
-You're tough. You're Teflon.
-That's me, an old frying pan.

79
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,172
I could use someone who can
handle the heat over here.

80
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,676
Someone who can be more
professional and less... Moonves.

81
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,010
What are you saying?

82
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,931
I want you to run Turteltaub's
new female-focused studio division,

83
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,683
-Girtletaub!
-I didn't sneeze.

84
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,060
No, Girtletaub is the studio.

85
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,521
I wanna announce a slate
before the Teddy story hits the trades.

86
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,981
You think you can throw one together?

87
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,900
You want me to pitch
my dream movie studio?

88
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,403
<i>I need it tomorrow morning. We gotta hit</i>
<i>the ground running with this thing.</i>

89
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,697
[stammers] You don't wanna
go slow and steady?

90
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,448
-What am I, a tortoise?
-[phone beeps]

91
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,367
Hmm.

92
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,576
Get me box office numbers.

93
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,704
We need firm financial figures to frame

94
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,123
how fans flock
to flicks that flex chicks,

95
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,209
woman films,
like <i>Pretty, Wonder, Little.</i>

96
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,961
<i>Diary of a Mad Black.</i>
I'll get my laptop.

97
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,462
Oh, wait! Your gig.

98
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,216
I have time. This is important.
<i>When a Man Loves a...</i>

99
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,759
-What?
-That's another film title,

100
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,177
as we were discussing previously.

101
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,887
Oh, of course.

102
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,309
Mm.

103
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,980
[phone rings, beeps]

104
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,565
-Hey, Guy, I'm about to...
<i>-Diane.</i>

105
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,901
Am I wearing a T-shirt right now that says
"Treat me like I'm some kind of asshole"?

106
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,738
I can't see you right now,
but I'm guessing by your tone, no?

107
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,615
Then why is my ex-wife treating me
like I'm some kind of asshole?

108
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,284
Did you tell her
you weren't wearing the shirt?

109
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,910
Lady got a job in Houston.

110
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,413
She's taking Sonny out of school
and moving to Texas.

111
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,497
She can't do that!

112
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,791
Well, she can,
because she has full custody.

113
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,836
And this is her dream job, and I'm really
happy for her. But this sucks!

114
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,008
Well, they must need cameramen
in Houston, and I can write anywhere...

115
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,177
I... couldn't ask you to do that.

116
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,678
I wouldn't ask you to ask.

117
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,931
If Sonny's going to Houston,
then we're going.

118
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:53,102
Okay. Okay. All right. Houston.
Uh, g-go, Astros!

119
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,562
Go... rodeos!

120
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,813
Hope you like barbecue!

121
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,650
I hope I don't need another abortion
because they are hard to get there!

122
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,861
-Wait, what?
-Just trying to think of Texas things.

123
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,780
Sorry. Houston!

124
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,285
All day at the airport,
I watch people pull suitcases.

125
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,746
Why do we suffer
that extra weight dragging us down?

126
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,206
Because we need clean clothes.

127
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,124
The point is: helium luggage.

128
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,794
Why pack light
when you can pack lighter than air?

129
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,172
All right, so Mom's too sick
to come out of her room

130
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,883
but not too sick
to make her famous Frito pie?

131
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,134
Well, she wanted to see you.

132
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,845
She was fine all day
and then suddenly ill with a stomach bug.

133
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,055
I wanna see her.

134
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,141
No, no, no, no, she's not there!
She's at the Zumba.

135
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,935
Is she at Zumba or is she sick?

136
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,313
She is sick but was hoping
the Afro-Latin fusion beats

137
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,232
-would make her feel better.
-[sighs]

138
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,900
This was a mistake.

139
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,820
-[car alarm chirps]
-[Todd] Hmm.

140
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,033
Todd, I must confess to you,
your mother is not at Zumba.

141
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,701
I can see her in the window.

142
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,871
Oh! That's a mannequin
so I can test out my outfits.

143
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,416
-You're lying again!
-[sighs]

144
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,128
Okay. She didn't come to dinner
because she's ashamed.

145
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,839
She can't say hello?
The woman has my kidney!

146
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,590
And that's why she's ashamed.

147
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,218
A mother shouldn't owe her child her life.

148
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,596
If she could turn it around somehow,
save your life...

149
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,765
-But, alas, she cannot.
-Huh.

150
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:17,103
But maybe if she could...
but no, you’re obviously healthy.

151
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,147
-But if you weren't...
-[gasps]

152
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,106
-But you are.
-Hmm.

153
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,443
-Clearly there is nothing to be done.
-Hmm.

154
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,243
[coughs] Ugh.

155
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,623
[inhales, sighs]

156
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,000
[clears throat]

157
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,501
-[Angela] <i>Hey.</i>
-Wha--

158
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,045
<i>Aren't you the horse</i>
<i>from "Horsin' Around"?</i>

159
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,715
[chuckles] Mm.

160
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,926
[grunts]

161
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,140
Look at this thing.
I fell down one time and I'm an invalid.

162
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,935
-Word to the wise, BoJack, don't get old.
-I'll see what I can do about that.

163
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,647
My 40-year-old companion
treats me like a fragile antique.

164
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,817
I've got a Lamborghini Miura
and she won't even let me drive it.

165
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,985
I'm sorry to hear that.

336

We have them. Jorge? Go! Go!

337
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,222
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!
We should have boxed them!

I never got to make it right.

341
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,898
Spare me the deets.
I just want the freets.

342
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,942
-Frito pies, that is.
-Oh!

343
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,112
No! Stop! [pants, exhales]

344
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,947
-Mom! Mom!
-Helen? Are you all right?

345
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,325
It's okay. It's not real. I'm fine!
It's a classic Todd shenanigan!

346
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,452
But how would you know what that is?

347
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,329
I think my wife is having a heart attack.

348
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,164
That's Margo Martindale, the actress!

349
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,457
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

350
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:45,045
I was too convincing!
Oh, if only I wasn't so good at acting!

351
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,469
It's funny, isn't it?
The things that matter?

352
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,513
The truth is none of it matters

353
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:58,017
and the truth is it all matters
tremendously.

354
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,061
It's a wonder any of us
ever get out of bed at all.

355
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,772
And yet, we get out of bed.

356
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,733
I'm going home.

357
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,068
[groans, inhales]

358
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,529
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking your car.

359
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,072
-What?
-You're not using it.

360
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,659
Someone should get some pleasure out
of something in this sad, stupid world.

361
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,994

362
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,162
Ugh.

363
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,371
[grunts] And I'm taking these.

364
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,005
But the lazy Susans
turned out to be very problematic.

365
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,340
-Why?
-<i>Offensive to Susans.</i>

366
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,469
There was a protest
organized by Susan Sarandon.

367
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,678
Oh, no!

368
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,848
Not that many Susans showed up.
You know what they say about Susans.

369
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,516
They're lazy?

370
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,226
Suddenly you're desperately seeking them.

371
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,104
Anyway, I don't know
how we got talking about me for so long.

372
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,106
You were gonna tell me
about your boyfriend. It's good?

373
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,317
It's really good. When I'm with him,

374
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,444
I feel like I'm part of an "us," you know?

375
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,615
Like, every other relationship, I always
felt like a "me" in a relationship.

376
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,574
Does that make sense?

377
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,868
Uh, yeah. That makes sense.

378
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,412
Sorry. I-I didn't realize
I was doing that.

379
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,206
I've always tried to be
an "us" with people

380
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,458
even when I could see
it wasn't a good idea.

381
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,711
Now that I'm single, I feel like
I'm finally learning how to be a "me."

382
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,629
That's great.

383
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,923
<i>I know there were times you would</i>
<i>try to tell me something</i>

384
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,800
and instead of listening,
I just tried to fix it

385
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,676
or convince you there wasn't a problem.

386
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,678
<i>I shouldn't have done that.</i>

387
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,472
We're all doing our best.

388
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,849
<i>-I wanna know now.</i>
-Know what?

389
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,185
Tell me what it's like to be Diane.

390
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,438
Okay. When you're Diane,

391
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:31,360
you can live your whole life
like it's a puzzle,

392
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,071
put together
from the pieces of different sets.

393
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,240
Like a crossover puzzle?

394
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,616
Exactly.

395
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,702
Your whole life is full
of these pieces that don't quite fit.

396
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,079
Sounds like a hard puzzle.

397
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,040
But at some point,
you start to think it's you.

398
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,377
<i>You're the piece that doesn't quite fit.</i>

399
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:55,217
<i>And you spend so long with that feeling</i>
<i>that the feeling becomes your home.</i>

400
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,095
And it can be jarring
when you discover one day

401
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,140
that you suddenly
don't feel that way anymore.

402
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,308
At first, you don't trust it.

403
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,854
But then, gradually, you do.

404
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,565
I'm sorry. That was a weird thing
to be telling my ex-husband.

405
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,732
No.

406
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,652
-I'm really happy for you, Diane.
<i>-It's funny.</i>

407
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,656
I feel like if we met each other
as the people we are now,

408
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,616
things would be totally different with us.

409
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,703
Yeah, but if we hadn't met
each other until now,

410
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,164
we wouldn't be the people we are now.

411
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,166
Yeah.

412
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,252
Two equally accomplished book writers.

413
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,588
Uh-huh.

-[roars, laughs]
-[screams]

415
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,176
You suffered an anxiety attack.

416
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,305
I'd encourage you to avoid
stressful situations like, uh,

417
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,016
fake kidnappings under abandoned bridges.

418
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,475
Okay, paperwork time.

419
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,062
You seem like a fellow who enjoys
unnecessary bureaucracy.

420
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,606
I do, Doctor.

421
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:55,235
Mm, was that the bridge
where they shot <i>Grease?</i>

422
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,362
-Yeah!
-That's neat.

423
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,324
Todd, I'm so sorry!

424
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,576
Oh, no, I know you didn't mean to--

425
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,412
I thought kicking you out
was the right thing.

426
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,123
You were 18.
You had dropped out of high school.

427
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,500
You were always high.
You only wore flip-flops.

428
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,961
-You never showered.
-You don't have to list everything.

429
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,423
I wanted you to grow up,
not leave forever.

430
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,968
Then more and more time passed
and I didn't know how to make it right.

431
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,722
Truth is, I did grow up. Your plan worked.

432
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:28,435
I haven't had a mom for so long, I...
I don't really need one anymore.

433
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,146
Oh. So, what do we do now?

434
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,066
Well, I do have one idea.

435
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,486
-What?
-A big robot suit like in <i>Aliens,</i>

436
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,614
but for babies
so they can do grown-up things!

437
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:45,244
-That sounds dangerous.
-Yeah, I guess it is.

438
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,080
But maybe the robots could be powered

439
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,208
by energy generated
from sucking on pacifiers.

440
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:57,005
That is so smart! Babies love sucking
and right now it's just wasted energy!

441
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,759
[Margo's voice] And so you see,
the circle had become complete.

442
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:05,055
All the twists and turns had all been
part of a beautiful tapestry,

443
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:10,060
a grander mission to bring this boy
and his mother together again.

444
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,730
That's quite a story.
But you've killed a lot of people.

What am I supposed to feed you?

00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,968
-All right, stop. You're nervous.
-Oh.

501
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,261
-Forget the script.
-Okay.

502
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,514
We're gonna do that movie that you're
always making me watch. You know...

503
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,642
You have to answer
for the chimpanzee, Tino.

504
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,311
No, Mickey, you got it all wrong!

505
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,688
So, where'd all the bananas go?

506
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,649
The chimp's dead, Tino. So's the bonobo.

507
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,568
Who you been monkeyin' around with?

508
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,695
I can't do it anymore!
It was the marmoset!

509
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,823
Good. Perfect.
Now look at the red dot. Go!

00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,784
What am I supposed to feed you?
I have mustard.

511
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,286
A mustard sandwich?

512
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,997
We may be orphans
but leave us our dignity.

513
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,832
Well, I can't fix you a martini.

514
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,043
Hey, wait! I have olives! [sniffs]

515
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,920
Nope. Not olives.

516
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,589
-Perfect!
-Yeah? You, you think we got it?
