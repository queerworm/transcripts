00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:26,484
Acting is about leaving everything behind,
and... [clicks tongue, sighs]

5
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,113
And becoming something completely new.

6
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,157
What is acting? Anyone?

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,326
Acting is about
leaving everything behind, and...

8
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,830
becoming something completely new.

[chuckles nervously] Oh...

16
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,647
What is acting?

17
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,024
Anyone?

18
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,609
Anyone?

19
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:13,239
Acting is about leaving everything behind
and becoming something completely new.

20
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,160
Nailed it.

00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,335

[clears throat]

25
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,110
{\an8}Good morning,
my name is Professor Horseman,

26
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,987
{\an8}which will remain
on that whiteboard forever,

27
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,489
{\an8}and this is Intermediate Scene Study.

28
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,658
{\an8}What is acting? Anyone?

29
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,119
-[all] Ooh!
-Oh! Okay. You.

30
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,787
{\an8}According to Stanislothski,

31
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,415
{\an8}acting is the desire
to create inside of oneself

32
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,333
{\an8}another, deeper, more interesting life

33
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,419
{\an8}than the one
that actually surrounds him...

34
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,336
or her.

35
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,214
-Oh, okay, yes, but also... Yes?
-[girl] Oh!

36
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:57,051
{\an8}Meisner would say, "Acting is behaving
truthfully under imaginary circumstances."

37
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,054
Acting is behaving truthfully
under imaginary circumstances.

38
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,932
Uh, okay, wow. So, that's acting.
But what is--?

39
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,895
{\an8}Guys, I'm concerned this class
is getting very theory-qua-theory...

40
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:07,937
 I was about to say that.

41
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,232
{\an8}...when technique should be a means
toward a more engaging art.

42
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,319
-Well, quite astute.
-Sorry, horse professor. What's acting?

43
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,278
{\an8}Um...

44
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,780
{\an8}Acting is the, um... [grunts]

45
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,866
Acting is...

46
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,534
Uh...

47
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,997
{\an8}I don't know what acting is.
I don't know what I'm doing.

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,165
I shouldn't be here.

49
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,958
-[boy] Wow.
-[girl] Oh!

50
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,046
{\an8}No, I don't want to quit.
I'm acting! That's acting.

51
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:33,963
Oh!

52
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,757
Class dismissed.

53
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,801
But we still have
an hour and 20 minutes left.

54
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,595
Yes. Again, I was acting.

55
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,930
You sounded serious.

56
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,016
Instead of judging my acting,
how about you act and I judge you?

57
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,601
{\an8}-For real?
-Yeah. Good point.

58
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,187
{\an8}We could show you the scenes
we were working on last semester.

59
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,939
Uh, sure.

60
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,567
{\an8}-This is from "Kablammo, Mother."
-Whenever you're ready.

61
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:59,405
{\an8}Mama, where's Daddy's old World War II
grenade with the pin still in it?

62
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,408
[in British accent] Why would you want
an old thing like that?

63
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:07,413
Tonight, I intend to explode myself.
Where are the extra towels?

64
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,957
-Okay, okay. Stop, stop.
-What?

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,834
{\an8}-Does this play take place in England?
-[normal voice] No.

66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,920
{\an8}So why are you talking
with an English accent?

67
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,129
I'm acting.

68
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,758
Just as an exercise,
maybe use your normal voice.

69
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,844
{\an8}And Tawnie, when you're telling
your mother you're gonna kill yourself,

70
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,389
the next line is,
"Where are the extra towels," right?

71
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,057
And the character's being very casual,

72
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,185
{\an8}so maybe she should also be casual
when she says she's gonna kill herself.

73
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,854
{\an8}Like it's a big deal,
but it's not a big deal for her.

74
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,149
-Like that's the irony of the scene.
-Whoa! That's really smart.

75
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,944
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

76
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,113
Okay, let's see it again.

77
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,158
So, darling, what fun and games
shall we play?

78
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,952
Shall we play Scattergories?

79
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,371
[raspy voice] I detest Scattergories!

80
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,499
Whatever the prompt,
you always answer in vague allusions

81
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,459
to the baby we never had!

82
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,420
Stop. You're both talking to the audience.

83
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,631
I want you to talk to each other,
you're having a conversation.

84
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,011
-Hey! Who's you?
-Who's me? Screw you is who's me!

85
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,514
I got the leads.
The Gooba Gooberry Falls leads.

86
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,017
Mm! Them's them good leads.

87
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,729
-Hubba hubba, I'm horny for leads!
-Okay, here's my question for you.

88
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,064
Does your character
know he's horny for leads,

89
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,025
or is he discovering it?

90
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,610
Who's next? Great. What's the scene?

91
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,738
The scene is I'm late for my next class.

92
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,698
We were supposed to get out
20 minutes ago.

93
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,616
Oh, shit. Sorry. See you Wednesday.

94
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,744
Great work today. Way to go, team.

95
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,747
We did it. That was great, huh?
How good was I?

97
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,381
Whitfield, we've been here six weeks.
How do you think this is going?

98
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,843
-I think I'm crushing it.
-Wow, okay. Well, I admire the confidence.

99
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,887
I know you're an acting major.

100
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,808
And I guess I just-- I wanted to make sure
that you're taking other classes.

101
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,228
Like, Economics,
or maybe a plumbing course.

102
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,147
Or rental car cashier class? I don't know.

103
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,775
What would you want to do
if the acting thing doesn't work out?

104
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,651
Hold up, do you think
I'm not a good actor?

105
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,611
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

106
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,114
You said "Not a good actor."
But now that you've said it...

107
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,950
Some would say there are no bad actors,
only bad teachers.

108
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,120
What about Jason Segel?
He was a bad actor in <i>Bad Teacher.</i>

109
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,331
I am a wonderful actor.

110
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,084
You'll see.

111
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,668
-[door closes]
-Okay.

112
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,215
She knew I was drunk,

113
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,634
but she still let me drive off
with Jonathan.

114
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,095
Whoa, oh! I'm a drunk!

115
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,679
Jesus, I had no idea, I--

116
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,932
Booze has taken everything from me.

117
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,185
-My job as an airline pilot, my wife.
-Huh? What the--?

118
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,311
Those two things.

119
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,146
[sighs] Okay. I see what's happening.

120
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,066
Sorry, everybody.
This is one of my acting students.

121
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,110
-He's trying to, um--
-Who's Whitfield?

122
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,196
-Nobody said "Whitfield."
-My name is Whip Whitaker.

123
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,491
-Did you follow me here?
-I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

124
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,161
Drove the plane upside-downsy.
Yeah, I'm drunk now.

125
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,287
-Wow.
-No, don't--

126
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,539
We've all been there, man.

127
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,333
He hasn't been there.
That's the plot of the movie <i>Flight.</i>

128
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,043
Glug, glug, glug.

129
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,337
-That wet the ol' whistle.
-So sorry, everyone.

130
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,675
Now I'm completely over the 0.8 percent
blood alcohol level.

131
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,428
-I'm in trouble. I am wasted.
-This is very disrespectful.

00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,972
-Hammered...
-We work hard to create a safe space here.

133
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,766
-...tanked, blitzed...
-So sorry about that. I recognize that.

134
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,561
-...Irish, canned, smashed...
-I value this room, just know that.

135
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,772
-...annihilated, laced, faded.
-Really sorry about all of this.

136
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,276
-So sorry.
-In conclusion, I am a drunk.

137
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,987
The big D.

138
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,575
-Fine. Shut up. You're a drunk.
-Aha! Wrong, I was acting!

139
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,995
It appears the student
has become the student-er.

141
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,166

Where's the whistle?

146
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,976
-Ugh!
-There are women tossing women everywhere!

147
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,604
What is this, the Running of the Brides
at Filene's Basement?

148
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,063
Who's with me?

149
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,399
[slurps]

150
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,317
Okay.

151
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,236
-Um, they're allowed to do that in rugby.
-What? Really?

152
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,239
Also, nobody knows
what Filene's Basement is.

153
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,575
That's a shame. You definitely paid
too much for that coat.

154
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,744
-[whistle trills]
-Oh, is it over? Did we win?

155
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,874
[exhales] Hey, you're really good.
I think.

156
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:23,753
Don't feel like you have to come
to these things if it's not your thing.

157
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,839
No, I liked it. Look at us. Doing college.

158
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:31,677
I'm just saying you have your things
and I have my things. It's okay.

159
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,804
-You wanna get something to eat?
-I-I can't.

160
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,766
When we win,
we all go to Conspiracy to celebrate.

161
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,560
-Sounds fun. Can I join you?
-I don't think you should.

162
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,146
It's a bar,
and there will be alcohol there.

163
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,856
-That's okay.
-And young girls.

164
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,777
-What's that have to do with anything?
-Nothing. Just stating a fact.

165
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,489
-Okay. Well, then, I guess I'll see you.
-Wouldn't wanna be you!

166
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,616
But I would. You're cool.

167
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,576
Thank you.

168
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,411
Hmm.

169
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,710
Yes, good. Keep doing what they're doing.

170
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,213
[sighs] Tawnie,
you're Hollyhock's best friend...

171
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,423
-We're actually in a fight right now.
-Again?

172
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,717
Our fights are like Adele songs.

173
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,345
All kind of the same one,
but with different specifics.

174
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,932
-Well, do you understand this rugby thing?
-Uh, honestly? No.

175
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,435
She came back from winter break
super aggro, but that's Hollyhock, right?

176
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,854
Suddenly, she decides,
"This is what I'm all about now,

177
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,815
and everyone else
just has to get on board."

178
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,441
What are we supposed to do with that?

179
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,945
-Whoa!
-I guess... get on board.

180
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,446
[whistle trills]

181
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,574
Get it out, get it-- Yes, nice.

182
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,576
Nice run! Very nice!

183
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,494
Touchdown! That's my sister!

184
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,537
Good try!

185
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,330
Try? She did it. She scored.

186
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,790
It's called a try.

187
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,625
Try to keep up.

188
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,545
-Hey! Hey!
-[sighing]

189
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,382
-Yeah!
-Yes, Cardinals!

190
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,967
-All right!
-All right!

191
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,302
[both grunt]

192
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,557
The two teams applaud each other,
and then the referees.

193
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,559
As is customary. See footnote.

194
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,977
We know.

195
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,562
What's up, rugger?

196
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,897
Two tries, two conversions,
and a drop goal?

197
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,774
Jonah Lomu over here.

198
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,860
-Great game, Hock.
-Oh, Hock.

199
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,987
I like it.
Can I get a nickname too, Regina?

200
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,198
How about, "Professor Horseman,
adult faculty member"?

201
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,868
-We have to go.
-Yeah, go.

202
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,370
Go. See you.
See you on the scrumming pitch.

203
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,288
[whistle trills]

204
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,373
W-E-S-leyan!

205
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,334
We will rock and maul and win!

206
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,918
Wait. Where's Hollyhock?

207
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,589
You mean Hollyhock
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero...

208
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,093
Hey. What the hell? You quit rugby?

209
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,055
God. You sound like three of my dads.

210
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,349
-The other five were relieved.
-You were good.

211
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:45,436
I need to focus on my studies.
I'm not just here to get my ya-yas out.

212
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,355
Yeah, but rugby's our thing.

213
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,397
[sighs]

214
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,858
Okay, then I guess we'll just--
We'll find a new thing.

215
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,695
How about my thing is reading
<i>Gender Trouble </i>by Judith Butler,

216
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,989
and your thing is being a teacher?

217
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:57,990
Are you okay?

218
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,826
[sighs] I'm just busy with school stuff.

219
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,828
You got your showcase in a couple weeks?

220
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,705
"An Evening of Modern American Scenes"?

221
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,957
Yeah. I'll-- I'll go to that.

222
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,294
-Great. I'll see you then.
-Yeah, see you then.

223
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,754
Not if I see you first--!

224
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,344
[phone ringing, beeps]

225
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,428
-Hello?
-Hey, listen.

226
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,722
-It's your very good accountant, Gaz.
-Hey, Gaz.

227
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,933
I just noticed you spent
a lot of money last year.

228
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,977
-Did you go to rehab? Like, a lot?
-You just noticed that?

229
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,523
I've got a ton of clients, okay?
And this was a big cocaine year for me.

230
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,067
But we're fine. Just make another movie,
and you'll be fine.

231
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,402
-You're working on a movie?
<i>-No.</i>

232
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,487
Actually, I'm a college professor now.

233
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,572
[sputters] What, do you hate money?

234
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,241
-<i>Gaz...</i>
-Ah, no, no, no, it's fine.

235
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,535
Basically, we're fine.
As I told my wife before she left me,

236
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,704
I'm not worried,
and you shouldn't be either.

237
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,414
We may need to unload some assets, though.

238
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,249
-You still own that restaurant?
-Elefante?

239
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,377
I'd love to dump that money pit,
but what idiot would buy it?

240
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:56,340
-Sold! On this arrangement.
-Of course you're sold. It was your idea.

241
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,218
Explain it to me one more time?

242
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,053
Okay. You'll spend a lot of time

243
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,806
with international superstar
sex symbol, Joey Pogo,

244
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,683
building a close emotional bond.

245
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,268
After you've established that connection,

246
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,396
you'll share one magical evening
of intimate sexual congress,

247
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,939
after which, we'll finally be even.

248
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,735
You'll marry me, and the two of you
will never see each other again.

249
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,862
-Well, I guess it's worth a try.
-♪ <i>Who's that dog? ♪</i>

250
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,155
<i>-♪ Mr. Peanutbutter ♪</i>
-Excuse me.

251
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,364
-[phone beeps]
-Hello? No?

252
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,158
Really? Wow, hold on a sec.

253
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,993
Pickles, should I buy Elefante?

254
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,288
Ooh! Then you'd be my husband and my boss.

255
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,206
Like Ike and Tina Turn-- No.

256
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,084
-Well, I'm sure there are good examples.
-There must be.

257
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,211
But buying a restaurant's
a big commitment.

258
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,797
What if I went in on it with you?
I like food.

259
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,508
Great idea, Joey Pogo. I'm in!

260
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,511
On you being in. On it. With me.

261
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,722
I've got big ideas for this place.

262
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,932
One word-- lazy Susans.

263
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,892
Hold on.

264
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:52,646
Before we make any rash decisions,
should we maybe consider the long-term...

265
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,025
[stammers] Pickles, this guy on the phone
is waiting, and I don't want to be rude.

266
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,444
Sorry. Of course.
Finish your conversation.

267
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,154
-Sold!
-[phone beeps]

268
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,239
-Now, you were saying?
-...ramifications.

269
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,033
Lazy Susans.

270
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,913
[raspy voice] Oh, Heidi,
you'll never bag a man

271
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,623
with all your talk of feminism,

272
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,876
and your grandfather in Switzerland,
and all your little goat friends--

273
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,796
Stop. Terry, this character is 28.

274
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,381
Is that what you think
a 28-year-old sounds like?

275
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,841
[normal voice] I mean, yes?

276
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,135
You do the same old-man voice
for every character.

277
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,387
Gotta have a gimmick if I'm gonna make it
in the show business.

278
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,847
In "the show business,"

279
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,892
when they have old man characters,
they cast real old men.

280
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,352
-I'll show you.
-Please don't.

281
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,646
You'll see.

282
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,065
We still have 20 minutes of class left.

283
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:42,071
I'd driven across that bridge drunk
hundreds of times, but never on black ice.

284
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,031
-[door opens]
-[Terry in raspy voice] Back in my day,

285
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,284
-we called that "the hidden slipperies."
-Oh, no.

286
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,120
But we didn't go to meetings
and talk about our problems.

287
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,749
-No, we made moonshine in bathtubs.
-Please leave. Now.

288
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,000
-Who's Terry?
-Nobody said Terry.

289
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,753
Mind if I sit a spell?
These old bones need a rest.

290
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,754
Sure, take it easy.

291
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,048
Everyone, this is another one
of my students.

292
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,468
I'm very sorry, I have no idea
why they think this is gonna impress me.

293
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,221
I just relieved myself in my adult diaper.

294
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,138
Terry...

295
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:12,434
Here I am, in the twilight of my years,
having drunk it all away.

296
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,603
-My job as an airline pilot...
-Wow.

297
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,772
-My son...
-You don't have a son.

298
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,358
Not anymore I don't,
because I abandoned him.

299
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,068
I abandoned my boy!

300
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,862
-[Whitfield] Papa?
-My boy!

301
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,114
-Oh, my God.
-Papa? Is that you?

302
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,701
I've gone blind, me has,
from working in the distillery!

303
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,244
Oh, my sweet child!

304
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,454
Ugh.

305
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,544
Todd, why don't you and Ruthie
go for a stroll

306
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,296
while I talk to these acting students?

307
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,299
She's just a baby, and I don't want
to expose her to too much desperation.

308
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,051
-You got it, boss.
-[Ruthie giggles]

309
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,387
Today, we have a very special guest.

310
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,514
This is my friend, Princess Carolyn,

311
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:55,019
who was nice enough to come here
to talk about the business of acting.

312
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,771
So, please do not embarrass me.

313
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,356
Oh, no.

314
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,067
How many months
until people get discovered, usually?

315
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,070
One? Two? [gasps] Three?

316
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,742
This is more of a comment than a question,
but I've seen every Robert Altman movie.

317
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,786
What's the best diner to be discovered in
drinking a milkshake?

318
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,746
[sighs]

319
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,666
What if I want to do nudity?
Do I still have to sign a waiver?

320
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:18,876
Huh!

321
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,461
[yawns]

322
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,212
Whoo!

323
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,799
Hey, who's the kid
that didn't ask a question?

324
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,052
-The brooding kid in the back.
-Oh, that's Stan.

325
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,219
That kid's got it.

326
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,638
The look, the sauce,

327
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,682
the power to make me feel
like a 13-year-old girl,

328
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,101
and to make a 13-year-old girl
feel like a woman.

329
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,311
I wanna cast him.

330
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,979
-You haven't even seen him act.
-Is he good?

331
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,149
[sighs] He's the best actor I got.

332
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,401
I had my doubts
when he did the scene from <i>Proof,</i>

333
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,112
but when he did the scene from <i>Doubt,</i>
I thought, "There's the proof."

334
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,572
-I have to sign him.
-No.

335
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,116
Stan needs to finish school.
He's a sophomore.

336
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,619
Great! A legal adult but he looks young.

337
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,830
He can play all the roles that other
young, impressionable actors can't

338
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,792
because they keep ODing,
or going to prison, or going to rehab,

339
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,960
or killing themselves.

340
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,921
-No, he's not ready.
-Why don't we let Stan decide?

341
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,174
I want to be your manager.

342
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:11,929
And I can get you Brooding Birthday Boy
on "Birthday Dad" right now.

343
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,847
Stan, LA's not going anywhere.

344
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,558
But you need an education,
something to keep you grounded.

345
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,561
Stan, look at me.
You have an opportunity now.

346
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,439
What do you need, a piece of paper?
You're done with this place.

347
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,608
Stan? Stan. Stan, Stan.

348
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,612
One day, you're gonna look back
and realize these days on campus,

349
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,281
they were the last days
you were truly free.

350
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,241
You want "free"?

351
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,327
Check out the Smirnoff Ice gifting suite
at the <i>Emmy Awards</i> after-party!

352
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,831
My whole career, all I wanted
was to get to a place like this,

353
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,999
and I didn't even know it.

354
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,084
Out there, there's nothing to protect you.

355
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,754
No, but there's a Patagonia jacket
that says "Birthday Dad" on it

356
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,923
that you get from being on "Birthday Dad."

357
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,802
We're safe here, Stan.
Please, don't make the mistake I did.

358
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,723
Come on, you'll get your own chair
with your name on it!

359
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,518
-[sighs] Damn it.
-Oh, good boy. Yes, he's a good boy.

360
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,937
Okay, first thing,
we're gonna get these teeth fixed.

361
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,028
[air horns blaring]

362
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,282
[vocalizing]

363
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,243
Marshmallow?

364
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,205
Thanks! [munching]

365
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,373
That was for the child.

366
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,417
Oh, should've specified.

367
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,211
If she can abstain from eating
the marshmallow for 15 minutes,

368
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,130
she'll receive an even bigger reward.

369
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,341
An even bigger reward than a marshmallow?

370
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,635
Remember these times, Ruthie.

371
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,720
Mm-hmm.

372
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,223
[phone beeps]

373
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,266
[phone buzzes, beeps]

374
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,602
-Go Todd for Maude!
-You're sitting in front of a marshmallow,

375
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,063
and if you don't eat it,
you get a bigger reward in 15 minutes.

376
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,856
-What do you do?
-Don't be a sucker, Todd.

377
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,982
Eat the marshmallow.

378
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,193
Who knows what the world's gonna be like
in 15 minutes?

379
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,611
That's all I needed to hear.

380
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,945
-Thanks, Maude.
-[phone beeps]

381
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,031
[Ruthie giggles]

382
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:58,285
Oh, no! What have I done?
We've got to find another marshmallow!

383
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,537
-[phone buzzes, beeps]
-Hey, Todd. You've got the Maude Squad.

384
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,414
Just kidding, it's just Maude.
I don't have a squad.

385
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,999
Maude? I didn't go to college.

386
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,210
-Where can I get a marshmallow?
-The dining hall?

387
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,421
Dining hall?
This is Wesleyan, not Hogwarts.

388
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,424
What's in a marshmallow anyway?
Maybe I can make one.

389
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,468
I think they're mostly chemicals.

390
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,762
To the chemistry lab!

391
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,101
-[grunts] You! Make me a marshmallow!
-[Ruthie giggles]

392
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,394
I'm trying to cure brain cancer.

393
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,480
That's not important right now!

394
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,981
If I don't get a new marshmallow,

395
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,651
some psychiatrist
is gonna get mad at this baby.

396
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,944
A psychiatrist?

397
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,072
I am so sick of the soft sciences
wagging the dog

398
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,366
in conversations
of behavioral development.

399
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,867
Let's teach them a lesson!

400
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,801
-I'm sorry, but the experiment's over.
-What? Why?

401
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,804
Because you ate the marshmallow.
Good day, sir.

402
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,222
Doctor?

403
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,559
[gasps]

404
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,476
You did it!

405
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,481
Hello, my name is Willie Wesleyan,
and you've won the school, my boy!

406
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,526
Wesleyan University is yours.

407
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,986
What? Why?

408
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,447
Somebody needs to keep
that stuffy old board of trustees in check

409
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,992
once I've shed this mortal skin.

410
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,286
-Oh...
-Sorry about that.

411
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,872
We're doing LSD research
in the room next door.

412
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,875
-Come on, Mr. Phillips. Time to go.
-[laughing]

413
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,751
The frozzleberries
taste like banozzleberries!

414
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,338
Yes, Mr. Phillips,
everything tastes like something.

415
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,551
So this is college.

416
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,636
[drum roll]

417
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,638
[knocks on door]

418
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,851
-You wanted to see me?
-Amy, yeah. Um, have a seat.

419
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,936
So we're nearing
the end of the semester here,

420
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,856
and I'm putting together the cast sheet
for the student showcase.

421
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,567
-Uh-huh.
-This showcase is a big deal.

422
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,738
This might sound crazy coming from
famous television star, BoJack Horseman,

423
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,949
but in some ways,
this showcase means even more to me

424
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,161
than the very popular TV shows
that, again, I was the star of.

425
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,246
-It means a lot to me, too.
-Does it?

426
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,706
'Cause you've been missing
a lot of classes.

427
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,459
And forgetting your lines.
You seem tired all the time, and...

428
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,711
I can be better. I'll prove it.

429
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:13,921
Okay.

430
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,258
As the water rose, I remember
fumbling through the glove compartment,

431
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,552
just praying
that I could find a pin hammer

432
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,346
so I could shatter the window.

433
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,058
-Uh, excuse me, is this...
-No. Nope, no, no, no. Get out of here.

434
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,309
-This has to stop.
-What?

435
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,729
This is a place for people who are serious
about making a change,

436
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,982
not for desperate acting students
pretending to have problems, Amy.

437
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,359
I was just trying to get help!

438
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,818
-Oof!
-[crying]

439
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,904
Oh! Oops! That was...

440
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:41,990
Oops.

441
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,418
-Hey, do you know what this show's about?
-I think it's about to start.

442
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,754
So keep your rugby voice
on the field, okay?

443
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,341
It turns out my hypothesis was correct.
Kids love marshmallows.

444
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,425
You don't say.

445
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,094
You still working on that memoir?

446
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,263
Well, funny story about that...

447
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:09,351
Oh, I love when stories start like that!
Ooh! You should put this one in your book.

448
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,729
Where the hell is she?

449
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,691
Horse professor, we're ready when you are.

450
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,902
Lights.

451
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,739
-[applause]
-Hello.

452
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,659
Thank you. Oh, wow, thank you.
That's very nice, thank you.

453
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,870
Welcome to
"An Evening of Modern American Scenes."

454
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,498
The students are very excited
to perform for you tonight.

455
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,793
They've come such a long way
over the course of the semester.

456
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,463
Like, a really-- a really long way.
They were very bad before.

457
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,631
But now...

458
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,884
Well, I mean,
you'll see for yourself, uh...

459
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,595
But, um, I'm proud of them.

460
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,225
Anyway, first up is a scene
from Sam German-Shepherd's "Real America."

461
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,687
[crowd whooping]

462
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,814
You think real America's
all about cowboys?

463
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,732
[line ringing]

464
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,277
Well, I say real America's about business!
And capitalism!

465
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,029
-[voicemail] <i>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</i>
-Ugh!

466
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,573
<i>-Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</i>
-God damn it.

467
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,201
I'm starting to think the real America
is me kicking your ass!

468
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,119
[all gasp]

469
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,083
BoJack? Oh, shit, your showcase!

470
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,044
Tawnie's gonna be so pissed!

471
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,755
Forget Tawnie. I'm pissed!
And it's happening right now.

472
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,381
I'm sorry. I forgot.

473
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:25,969
I know your students just have to do
a scene, but I have multiple final papers.

474
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,930
If you're implying
acting is a bullshit major, you're right.

475
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,850
But people came all the way
from California to see my showcase.

476
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,770
From Chicago.
You can't even walk across campus?

477
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,980
Okay, let me put some pants on.

478
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,941
-You've been avoiding me all semester.
-I just have a lot going on.

479
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,152
I go to school here.
I'm a college student.

480
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,155
-I thought I'd see you more.
-This was mine before you got here.

481
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:49,785
This was my life, my world,
and you just, like, live here now.

482
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,995
And you could have asked me, by the way.

483
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,956
Okay, I'm sorry.
I guess I thought my sister...

484
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,918
No, don't say that.
Like it means something.

485
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,921
-It does mean something.
-We don't know each other, really.

486
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,049
-What?
-No, I'm just saying it's fine.

487
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:08,970
I had a life before I met you,
and you had a life before you met me.

488
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,347
I don't want that life.

489
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,518
That life, that person?
That's not who I am, I...

490
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,146
I'm sorry I came here
without asking you first.

491
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,314
That was selfish.

492
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,608
Okay. Thank you.

493
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,986
If this is too weird for you,
I don't have to come back next semester.

494
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,114
I can get a job somewhere else.

495
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,033
Tawnie says you're a really good teacher.

496
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,911
She did? Huh.
I thought you were in a fight.

497
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,038
Yeah, but I still love her.

498
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,665
Are we in a fight?

499
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,501
Yeah, but... [sighs]

500
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,544
Yeah.

501
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,879
I should get back to the show.

502
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:47,134
If you want to come back in the fall,
that could be cool.

503
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,301
-Yeah?
-Just...

504
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,595
We need to take things slow, you know?

505
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,932
Yeah. I know.

506
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,684
Thanks.

512

-You need to stop this.
-What?

525
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,415
The reporters who keep trying
to get Penny to tell her story.

526
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,458
What-- What reporters?

527
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,628
Whatever they're doing,
I don't want to be included, okay?

528
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,922
I don't want my daughter to be included.

529
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,216
Charlotte, I swear, I don't know
what you're talking about.
