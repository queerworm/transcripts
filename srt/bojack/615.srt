00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,927
[birds chirping]

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,348
[doorbell rings]

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,309
What you got there?

4
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,061
I think it's a hydrangea.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,272
Does she even like that kind of plant?

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,649
Probably not. She doesn't like anything.

7
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,443
Hello, BoJack.

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,944
Thanks for having me, Mom.

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,612
You're the guest of honor.

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,073
Everyone, BoJack is here.

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,451
-[Herb] Hey, buddy! Get in here!
-[Sarah Lynn giggles]

12
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,703
-For you.
-Oh, a plant.

13
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:40,665
-Dirt for inside. Goody.
-[sighs]

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,667
[theme music playing]

15
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,516
[dripping]

16
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,726
You got here just in time, BoJack.

17
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,394
A bird flew in through the window

18
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,396
and we're having trouble
getting her out of the house.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,108
[Sarah Lynn] Yeah, call yourself early
and go get a worm!

20
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,985
Golly, she's more coy
than a coyote claiming a cottontail.

21
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,196
-Ahem. Phone for you, Mrs. Horseman.
-[grunting]

22
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,405
Thank you, butler.

23
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,157
-Is that Zach Braff?
-Who?

24
00:01:56,241 --> 00:02:00,537
{\an8}Zach Braff. Actor, independent filmmaker,
real-life friend of Donald Faison?

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,747
{\an8}-You mean my butler?
-At your service!

26
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,999
{\an8}I actually was friends with Donald
in real life.

27
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,334
{\an8}He's a spectacular man--

28
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,711
{\an8}-Butler!
-Sorry! Phone call for you.

29
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,963
{\an8}I'll take it in the kitchen.

30
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,633
{\an8}BoJack, make yourself useful for a change
and help, will ya?

31
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,009
{\an8}With the bird?

32
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,471
{\an8}Hello? Oh, it's you.

33
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,850
{\an8}All right. That does it! [grunts]
Son of a--!

34
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,976
{\an8}With a drop like that,

35
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,520
{\an8}you'd think she was the ratings
for <i>Veronica's Closet</i>

36
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,646
{\an8}when it moved to Mondays.

37
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,607
{\an8}Ugh. Comedy poison.
Who wants to laugh on a Monday?

38
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,027
{\an8}BJ! Finally made it
to our little soirée, huh?

39
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,363
{\an8}Yeah, I kept having this dream
where I was having dinner

40
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,783
{\an8}with all the people who were gone
and I thought, "I should do that!"

41
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,743
{\an8}So, here I am.

42
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,413
{\an8}-We've got to flank her from the left.
-[bird] Huh?

43
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,039
{\an8}Hello. Crackerjack?

44
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,375
{\an8}-That's what it says on my underpants!
-[giggles]

45
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,461
{\an8}[grunts] The uncle I never met
and yet could never live up to!

46
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:55,300
{\an8}[grunts] All right, soldier. Ready, aim...

47
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,593
{\an8}-[bird giggles]
-Huh?

48
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,052
{\an8}Hey! What's up, man?

49
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,847
{\an8}Hey, Corduroy. [stammers] Good to...

50
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,308
{\an8}Still weirded out because the last time
you saw me I was naked,

51
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,352
{\an8}hanging from my iPhone charger,
holding a lemon, with a very erect penis

52
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,480
{\an8}despite being deceased in my trailer
for over an hour?

53
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,565
{\an8}Yep.

54
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,567
{\an8}You're gonna have to get over that, buddy.

55
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,986
{\an8}Hmm. Mm. Ooh.

56
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,238
{\an8}-What are you...? Stop that.
-Oh! Oh, sorry.

57
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,948
{\an8}Forgot where I was for a second.

58
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,201
{\an8}-Think this'll help?
-Kid's got the right idea.

59
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,454
{\an8}We can chuck the choker
and spook her with this poker!

60
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,998
{\an8}-Show her who's boss!
-[Sarah Lynn] Ruffle her feathers!

61
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,541
{\an8}[Corduroy] Get her to the kitchen!

62
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,918
{\an8}[grunting]

63
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,127
{\an8}And that!

64
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,755
-All right!
-[Herb] Go!

65
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:34,881
[Crackerjack] Ha-cha!

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,761
-[Sarah Lynn cheers]
-[all whooping]

67
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:43,181
Yes, yes, BoJack bullied a bird.
Bully for him.

68
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,474
Speaking of useless,

69
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,185
my husband is running late,
so we're gonna start dinner without him.

70
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,020
He'll be here before the show starts,
won't he?

71
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,021
{\an8}He'd better be.

72
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,482
{\an8}In the meantime,
let's adjourn to the dining room

73
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,361
{\an8}before our dinners get
as cold as my parenting style.

74
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,863
[all laughing]

75
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,406
[Sarah Lynn] I think mine would be

76
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,909
the first time someone asked
for my autograph.

77
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,118
-Really?
-Oh, wow!

78
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,870
I didn't even know how to write my name!

79
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,330
I just drew a squiggle!

80
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,790
-Water?
-Thank you, Zach Braff.

81
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,459
You only get to give
your first autograph once, you know.

82
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,963
The second time it becomes an obligation,
the third time a chore.

83
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,132
But the first time...
[sighs] The first time... [chuckles]

84
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,469
-Hey. What is that?
-Ah, ah, ah.

85
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,137
Shh.

86
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,140
-[BoJack] Mm.
-Okay. My turn.

87
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,060
Mine was also when I signed
on a dotted line to enlist.

88
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,939
Are you ready to sing "The Lollypop Song"
in the big show later?

89
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,066
No, Mom.
You know I never make it to the show.

90
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,820
I didn't know then that enlisting
would lead to my two worst parts.

91
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,571
You have two?
I didn't know we could pick two.

92
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,907
Corduroy, it's a conversation,
not an assignment.

93
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,493
-[Corduroy] In that case, I have three.
-[Herb] Three is way too many.

94
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,453
My worst parts were saying goodbye
to my mother

95
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,789
and seeing a bullet go straight
through my general's face,

96
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,124
right before it hit my own.

97
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,294
-[all gasp]
-At least your death was instantaneous.

98
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:58,715
I can still hear the loud drips of my IV
from when I had cancer.

99
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,842
-Drip. Drip.
-Ooh.

100
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,719
-[Corduroy] What about you, BoJack?
-What?

101
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,429
Best part, worst part, what about you?

102
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,265
Well, I guess my worst part
has to be, um...

103
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,853
Right before I got here, I think? Uh...

104
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,480
I went to Angela Diaz's house.

105
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,940
[gulps, spits] Ugh!

106
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,234
Does anyone else's water
taste like chlorine?

107
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,486
Hey, Braff, can I get
some different water over here?

108
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,654
Right away, Mr. Horseman.

109
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,115
Crackerjack, do you think your death
meant something

110
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,868
because it was in the service
of a greater cause?

111
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,619
-Aw, shucks.
-Of course it meant something.

112
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,247
I think questions like that are too big
for a little soldier like me.

113
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,374
My brother gave the ultimate sacrifice.

114
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,127
-Because sometimes I wonder--
-But see, this is where I get hung up,

115
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,047
because when we valorize
the idea of sacrifice,

116
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,799
-of loss, of suffering--
-BoJack, don't start with this again.

117
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,427
When we grow up
in a house that does that,

118
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,348
we internalize this idea
that being happy is a selfish act,

119
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,058
but sacrifice doesn't mean anything.

120
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,726
-[Sarah Lynn] Yes, it does.
-Sacrifice?

121
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:55,229
In the service of something greater,
maybe, but just in and of itself?

122
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,773
-What's the good in that?
-A lot.

123
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,191
Sacrifice is good.

124
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:02,779
It has to be because I sacrificed a ton,
and I was freaking awesome.

125
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,822
Oh, and what did you ever sacrifice?

126
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,199
I gave everything.

127
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,533
I gave my whole life.

128
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,744
You died in a hedonistic bender.

129
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,412
I'm not talking about my death.

130
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,750
I'm talking about my life.
I gave my whole life.

131
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,294
If we get into everyone's whole life,
we're gonna be here all night.

132
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,214
It's called "Best Part/Worst Part,"
not "Everything That Ever Happened."

133
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,507
Okay, worst part:

134
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,927
the 2007 "Sexually Confident Virgin Tour."

135
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,013
My manager leaked nudes
to get more tour dates added,

136
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:33,017
my mom pointed out every carb I ate,
it was hell.

137
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:37,438
But it gave millions of fans
a show they will never forget.

138
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,023
And that is worth something.

139
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,817
No, that's a high you chase.

140
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,194
-It was not.
-You think you singing songs on stage

141
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,822
is the same thing as this guy
who died liberating the camps?

142
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,282
We don't need to compare
apples to Auschwitzes.

143
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:52,787
Herb, tell 'em. It means something--
the work we do, the joy we bring.

144
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,372
It has to, right?

145
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,875
Boy, I sure thought so.
I-I used to really believe in it.

146
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,045
I mean, I was one "trapped in an airport
during a snowstorm

147
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,965
on the eve of the dance championship
guest starring Gregory Hines" episode

148
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,383
away from an Emmy.

149
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,676
Then I lost it all.

150
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,053
Ow! Seriously, is no one noticing
this leak?

151
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,304
Fine, we'll get a bucket.

152
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,723
-The drips are hitting me!
-Then you'll hold the bucket.

153
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,724
But the funny thing is,

154
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,978
it wasn't until I got fired
that I actually became myself.

155
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:21,232
I was out of the closet. I was free.
I was authentically me.

156
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,235
What does being authentic
have to do with anything?

157
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,864
Well, when I wasn't hiding
behind some facade, I could be at peace.

158
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,116
That's when I really got
into philanthropy.

159
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,743
-Can I ask you something, Herb?
-Why do people say that?

160
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,330
If you're asking it, then yes,
you can and you will and you just did.

161
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,583
Yeah, why are we announcing our questions?

162
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,086
-Yeah, what are these questions, royalty?
-[imitates fanfare]

163
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,548
Announcing King and Queen Query
of the Interrogative Isle.

164
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,717
May I ask you how do you do?

165
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,470
-Very well, thanks.
-Ah, bup, bup, bup!

166
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,140
I didn't ask you yet.
I asked if I could ask you.

167
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,975
Did you get pleasure
from your charity work?

168
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,602
Like real, deep pleasure?

169
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,896
It dwarfed every other joy in my life.

170
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,815
Doesn't count then.
If you got pleasure, it wasn't selfless.

171
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,901
And it's only good if it's selfless.

172
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,903
Who made up that rule? I helped people.

173
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,322
Who cares if it made me feel good, too?

174
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,073
Feeling good is inherently selfish.

175
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,868
If I'd given myself to Christ,
truly went down the path--

176
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,955
I don't care for this talk of religion
in my house.

177
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,958
If I wasn't constantly
trying to feel good, get it better,

178
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,962
always looking for maximum pleasure...
[sighs] That was my worst part.

179
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,341
Well, one of the three worst parts.
Wait, actually, can I have four?

180
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,677
Discovering you in your trailer
definitely cracks my top five.

181
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,720
This is bullshit!

182
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,307
I did a lot for a lot of people!
I was not a bad person.

183
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,018
No one is accusing you
of being a bad person, Sarah Lynn.

184
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,311
[yelling] You are! You all are

185
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:45,483
with your "being authentic"
and "charity work" and "killing Nazis."

186
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,110
I actually never killed a Nazi.
All my kills were friendly fire.

187
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,031
I also never liberated any camps.
I'm honestly not sure what I did.

188
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,742
Here you go.
Your husband just pulled up, ma'am.

189
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,370
Wait, Dad's here?
He's never made it to dinner before.

190
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,998
-Hey, here's a question.
-Another question has arrived!

191
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,919
Did any of you have a song of yours
played in outer space?

192
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,129
Anyone? No. Just me? Oh.

193
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,214
That's what I thought.

194
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:13,219
My hit single "No, No, No (No Means Yes)"
is making its way to Mars!

195
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,513
That means something.
I will be remembered.

196
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,599
-That has to mean something. I will be--
-[door opens]

197
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,268
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss the show?

198
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,727
-Hey!
-There he is! There's our guy!

199
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,645
-Dad!
-I...

200
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,648
Oh, you didn't miss a thing.
It's not like we have anywhere to be.

201
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,442
Why shouldn't we all bend ourselves
to your schedule?

202
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,444
I already apologized. I was running.

203
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,905
Yes. As always, running late,

204
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,367
while I was running myself ragged
trying to get dinner on the table.

205
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,202
-[clears throat]
-Yes, you helped.

206
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,247
And now I'm running out of patience
for you running your mouth.

207
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,166
And I'm running out the clock
until we both...

208
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,502
Well. Here we are.

209
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,046
I'll just squeeze in here.

210
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,385
-Get yourself something nice.
-Ooh! Thank you, Mr. Secretariat.

211
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,596
-What'd I miss?
-We're playing Best Part/Worst Part.

212
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,556
Ooh! I got one! Machu Picchu.

213
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,810
When I left "Horsin' Around,"
I honestly thought about killing myself.

214
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,270
Shit, Herb. Really?

215
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,522
Yeah. But the Knicks
were having a good season

216
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,065
and I wanted to see what happened.

217
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,317
Wait, you didn't kill yourself

218
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,569
because the Knicks
were having a good season?

219
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,946
What would you have done
if they were having a bad season?

220
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,823
I don't know. Gotten into baseball?

221
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,409
Oh, for the love...
Where's your follow-through?

222
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,369
It's like you didn't even
wanna kill yourself!

223
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,704
And I'm so glad I didn't.

224
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,166
Because there I was ten years later
at Machu Picchu

225
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:30,004
and I realized there was so much more
I could do in a life.

226
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:30,963
Okay, my turn.

227
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:36,010
August 22nd, 1973,
I was banned from running ever again.

228
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,846
And running, well, that was the only thing
that ever made sense to me,

229
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,099
-so if I couldn't do that I was nobody.
-[coughing]

230
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,852
-This is your worst part?
-Best part: jumping off that bridge.

231
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,647
-Jesus.
-What did I say about the Jesus talk?

232
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,024
It was my choice.
I got to go on my own terms.

233
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,275
Not a lot of people can say that.

234
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,693
-No.
-That's true.

235
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,403
The view from up there.

236
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,114
-Eh, you wouldn't believe it.
-[coughs]

237
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,533
-[all laughing]
-Oh, my.

238
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,372
-It must've been from swimming earlier.
-Oh, you were swimming?

239
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,415
Yeah. I, um... [clears throat]

240
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,125
-When was I swimming?
-Don't think about that.

241
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,795
-Do you have a best part?
-Oh, uh, I don't know.

242
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,546
This past year I took a teaching job.

243
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,216
And I had this one student
who was really struggling,

244
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,759
just couldn't get over this hump.

245
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,638
And what, you helped him
do good in a scene? For your class?

246
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,682
That's the best part of your whole life?

247
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,433
I don't know, I was just spitballing.

248
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,352
I didn't know you were gonna put me
on the spot like this!

249
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,063
Come on, buddy.
What was so special about that moment?

250
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,649
It felt good to help someone do something.

251
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,359
See? Helping someone, like I said!

252
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,946
But he liked it because it felt good,
like I said!

253
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,075
I liked it because it reminded me
of when I was young, just starting out.

254
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,244
You and me, screwing around,
hitting up open mics.

255
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,037
Trying to figure it out. I think...

256
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,581
-I think that was the best part.
-Really?

257
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, are we ready to start the show?

258
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,336
-[Corduroy] Let's do this!
-Okay, nice seeing you all!

259
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,379
You're not coming?

260
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,298
This is always the part where I wake up.
You all go to the show.

261
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,050
Zach Braff says "Pardon my reach"

262
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,511
even though he can clearly
get my plate from another angle.

263
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,722
-Then I wake up.
-Oh, okay.

264
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,892
-Next time then. [sighs]
-[dripping]

265
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,394
Pardon my reach.

266
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,605
Hmm.

267
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,573
[Herb] Hello, everyone!
Please take your seats.

268
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,912
Tonight's show is in honor
of BoJack Horseman!

269
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,040
What do you say, huh?
Should we get this show started?

270
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,002
Yeah! Tonight's opener
needs no introduction,

271
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,462
but I'm gonna give her one anyway.

272
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,507
Ladies and gentlemen,
the one, the only, Sarah Lynn!

273
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,177
-[audience cheers, applauds]
-Thank you, thank you!

274
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:47,099
I'd like to dedicate tonight's performance
to the man of the hour, BoJack Horseman!

275
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,104
Sarah Lynn, I'm so sorry
for everything that happened with you.

276
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,939
With us. I should have protected you...

277
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,233
Ah, ah, ah. BoJack. This is my time.

278
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,444
Yes. Of course. Sorry.

00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,979
-Of what?
-That life has meaning or purpose, that...

327
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,190
that if you check the right boxes
and do the dance,

328
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,983
then you get a little parting gift
at the end,

329
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,987
a framed certificate that says,
"Congratulations, you've got peace."

330
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,155
[chuckles]

331
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,282
-I wouldn't mind that.
-But guess what?

332
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,909
All the time those people spent,

333
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,245
trying to do good or help people
or be something?

334
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,791
I did none of that shit,
and yet here I am, same as them.

335
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,169
You were the fastest runner in the world.
You inspired millions.

336
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,713
And yet, here I am, same as you.

337
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,800
So, if you could go back, do it again,
what would you do different?

338
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,886
[sighs] What would I do?
I wouldn't have cared so much.

339
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,930
Cared about what? Racing?

340
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,348
About everything.

341
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,101
I know this part is confusing
because I'm Secretariat

342
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,269
and also your dad for some reason,

343
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,649
but speaking as your dad,
it's important that you know that I cared.

344
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,193
No. You never cared.
You cared about your book.

345
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,361
You cared about getting drunk

346
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,862
and telling everyone
how miserable you were,

347
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,114
but that's not caring.

348
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,741
You think I didn't care
because I put up walls,

349
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,618
but I cared so much, BoJack.

350
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,329
About you, about your mother.

351
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,083
I wanted you to respect me.
I wanted you to love me.

352
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,419
I was so afraid that you would know that.

353
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,255
I cared so much.

354
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,676
It's a shame that we could never
talk like this in real life.

355
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,261
All the good it would have done.

356
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,888
Least we got the chance this time,
before I wake up.

357
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,931
[chuckles]

358
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,517
Wake up?
Oh, you're not getting it, are you?

359
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,768
Getting what?

360
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,819
Loss is a collaborative art,

361
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,947
between the people who leave us
and those who remain.

362
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,409
We dance with the shadows
of their absence.

363
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,746
-With that in mind, I present to you...
-[grunts] Stop the show!

364
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,456
-Excuse me.
-What's happening?

365
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,501
You're being very rude.
I was about to do my roller-dance routine.

366
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,088
-Calm down, son.
-Yes, why don't you sit down, and--

367
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,965
-No!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no. Please!

368
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,718
I'm not ready. I never got to direct
my <i>Backdraft</i> remake:

369
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,386
"Zach Braff's Backdraft"!

370
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,721
I never finished my memoir:

371
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,640
"I Started A Zach Which Started
The Whole World Braffing!"

372
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,767
I never got to license

373
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,644
the Zach Braff Short Stack
Breakfast Attack at Shake Shack!

374
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,731
Cash-strapped hash brown fans
who hashtag "Zach's snacks"

375
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:49,860
get cash back fast
with the Braff Bucks app!

376
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,072
I need to wake up. I can't be here.

377
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,783
Of course. Everything's always about you.

378
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,786
-BJ, buddy...
-Herb! How did I get here?

379
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,995
How the hell should I know?

380
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,373
I broke into my house.
But it wasn't my house anymore.

381
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,542
I was... I was watching
the "Horsin' Around" Blu-ray.

382
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,170
Yes. Yeah, and I drank some more
and I found some pills.

383
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,922
And then I went swimming...

384
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,591
No! No! No! No, wait, wait, wait!
I got out of the pool.

385
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,009
Yes! And I called Diane!

386
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,844
BoJack, we're trying to do a show here.

387
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,929
But I called Diane.

388
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,014
I couldn't have drowned
if I got out of the pool to call Diane!

389
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,015
So, I shouldn't be here.

390
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,143
[stammers] If I could just finish
the conversation. Where's a phone?!

391
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,938
[pants]

392
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,733
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a real treat for you next.

393
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,651
A real treat.

394
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,820
Come and see him
before he makes a run for it.

395
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,115
-No! Stop!
-It's Secretariat!

396
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,826
Stay calm. Flyin' off the handle
won't change a thing.

397
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,286
This was gonna happen to you
one of these days.

398
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,831
A poem. Original, obviously.

399
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,793
It's called "The View from Halfway Down."
[clears throat]

400
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,755
"The weak breeze whispers nothing
The water screams sublime

401
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,843
His feet shift teeter-totter
Deep breath, stand back, it's time

402
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,304
Toes untouch the overpass
Soon he's water bound

403
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:03,559
Eyes locked shut but peek to see
The view from halfway down"

404
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,977
[audience applauds, cheers]

405
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,481
I'm not done. Hold on. I'm not done.
I'm not done. [clears throat]

406
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,611
"A little wind, a summer sun
A river rich and regal

407
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,699
A flood of fond endorphins
Brings a calm that knows no equal

408
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,033
You're flying now

409
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,578
You see things much more clear
Than from the ground

410
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:27,166
It's all okay, it would be
Were you not now halfway down

411
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,044
Thrash to break from gravity

412
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,173
What now could slow the drop?

413
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,801
All I'd give for toes to touch
The safety back at top"

414
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,762
I change my mind. [stammers]
I change my mind. I don't wanna--

415
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,264
It's okay.

416
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,267
"But this is it, the deed is done

417
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,561
Silence drowns the sound

418
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,814
Before I leaped I should have seen
The view from halfway down

419
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:55,569
No! I really should have thought
About the view from halfway down"

420
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,906
Find your peace, big guy. Find it.

421
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,659
"I wish I could have known
About the view from halfway down--"

422
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,827
[BoJack gasps]

423
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,371
I need to get out of here!

424
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,876
-Wha--
-BJ, where do you think you're going?

425
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,419
Nothing you do in here matters, pal.

426
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,797
Yelling and struggling isn't gonna
pull your body out of that pool,

427
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,801
-so you might as well just--
-Sit down! [echoes]

428
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,802
But I...

429
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,306
Look, BJ, it's possible that someone
is going to find you and save you,

430
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,808
and it's also possible that someone won't.

431
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,143
We don't get to know.

432
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,353
Can I ask you a question?

433
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,438
[imitates fanfare]

434
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,024
Has anyone ever come back from this place?

435
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,567
-[sighs]
-[mic feedback]

436
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,070
BJ, there is no place.

437
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:42,491
It's just your brain going through
what it feels like it has to go through.

438
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,370
All you can do right now
is sit back and enjoy the show.

439
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,913
[sighs]

440
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,582
Folks, here is Beatrice Horseman

441
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,919
with her younger older brother,
Crackerjack!

445
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,688
Hoo!

446
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,648
[BoJack exhales]

447
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,573
This is the hard part. [grunts]

448
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,076
Golly.

449
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,123
And now the easy part.

450
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,542
Over and out!

451
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:34,960
[grunts]

452
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,337

454
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,640
Wow. Beatrice Horseman, huh?

455
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,559
You know, she was gonna sing
for us tonight,

456
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,978
but apparently, she was a little "horse."

457
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,813
[chuckles]

458
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,107
Okay. You ready for the headliner?

459
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,483
-[audience cheering]
-No.

460
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,610
-Please welcome to the stage...
-[drumroll]

461
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,653
No. Please.

462
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,947
The star of "Horsin' Around"

463
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:09,536
and "The BoJack Horseman Show"!
"Philbert"! "Secretariat"!

464
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,872
The upcoming "Horny Unicorn"!

465
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,374
Son of Butterscotch and Beatrice!

466
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:19,629
Husband to no one! Father to none,
that we know of! [chuckles]

467
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,840
Stand-up comedian, actor,

468
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,759
crippling alcoholic!

469
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:29,639
A talented charmer
and a stupid piece of shit.

470
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,643
It's... BoJack Horseman!

471
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,860
Is it terrifying?

472
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,196
No. I don't think so.

473
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,114
It's the way it is, you know?

474
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,869
Everything must come to an end,
the drip finally stops.

475
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,246
See you on the other side.

476
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,584
Oh, BoJack, no, there is no other side.

477
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,461
This is it.

478
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:07,427

-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Thank God, Diane. Okay, Diane.
Diane, you're gonna save me, right?

492
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,348
I called you
and you're coming to get me?

493
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:57,602
<i>BoJack, why did you call me?</i>
<i>I live in Chicago. I can't save you.</i>

494
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,063
-You didn't pick up.
<i>-Right.</i>

495
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,732
-It went to voicemail.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

496
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,278
And then... I went back in the pool.

[squelching]

498
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,201
<i>-It's too late. What's done is done.</i>
-No.

499
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:18,206
<i>There's nothing I can do, BoJack.</i>
<i>I'm not real. None of this is.</i>

500
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,169
-So, what do I do now?
<i>-BoJack, it doesn't matter.</i>

501
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,381
Well, if it doesn't matter,
can I stay on the phone with you at least?

502
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,008
<i>Okay.</i>

503
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,760
How was your day?

504
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,847
<i>-Good.</i>
-Yeah?

505
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:38,059
<i>Yeah. My day was good.</i>
