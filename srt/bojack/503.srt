-Why does she feel bad for me?
-We should put on something else!

-Todd is the president of ad sales.
-Mm, look at you.

173

-And he went to a really good college.
-I did?

174
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,079
That's very impressive.

175
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,957
I'm afraid we don't know a lot
about the world of big business.

176
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,459
As I'm sure Yolanda has told you,

177
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,086
I'm but a humble,
best-selling, erotic novelist

178
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,547
and my wife is a world-famous,
adult, film star,

179
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,801
and Yolanda's identical twin sister,
Mindy, is a sex advice columnist.

180
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,262
Wow! Yolanda told me all of that.

181
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,975
That's all really great information,
that I was already privy to.

182
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,561
Well, the important thing is
that Yolanda is happy

183
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,233
and she's finally found a man, woman,
or object to have sex with.

184
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,194
Todd is very accomplished
at sexual intercourse. Aren't you, Todd?

185
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,656
Yeah, I'm the best at the sex.
Hooba, hooba.

186
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,657
Um...

187
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,660
-Are you trying to say "hubba, hubba"?
-Uh...

188
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,121
You know, Todd, I have a bit
of a reputation, myself. [moans]

189
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,541
-Whoa!
-Okay, we should be hitting the road.

190
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,793
Oh, but you must stay for erotic dessert.

191
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,296
You know, I saw the erotic dessert
in the kitchen.

192
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,758
Who knew you could make
such a realistic anus out of marzipan?

193
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,052
You can thank my husband.
He posed for the baker.

194
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:17,557
Wow, you know,
it really puts the "um" in "yum."

195
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,393
I insist you spend the night
and make love in my home.

196
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,978
-Uh...
-I can't think of a reason,

197
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,106
you wouldn't want to have sex
in your parents' house.

198
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,233

200
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:33,364
No! Of course we'll spend the night,

00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,078
Hey, I got a suggestion for that scene
where you make your big confession.

-Okay, look at that! Found an emotion.

207
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,422
I'm gonna tell you
something very personal.

208
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,050
When I was a little girl, my mom took me
to see <i>A Kernel of Truth</i> on Broadway.

209
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:53,968
It wasn't a big hit.

210
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,971
Yeah, I know. I Googled the reviews
so I could mock you.

211
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,515
That Frank Rich could be
a real frank bitch, am I right?

212
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,642
Well, I was six and it blew my mind.

213
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,562
I spent my childhood dreaming of, one day,
getting to sing on Broadway.

214
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,397
But, I guess, I wasn't good enough.

215
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,234
So now I get steady TV work,
which is fine, and I'm fine,

216
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,194
but I still listen to that musical

217
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,780
because it reminds me of a time
when I was less jaded,

218
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,576
when I believed I could do anything,
and that makes me feel good.

219
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,328
Oh, my God, Gina.

220
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,331
I-I didn't realize how much
this musical meant to you.

221
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,168
-And that... that's even funnier!
-Oh!

222

223
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,464

you'd be giving me shit.

Ugh, when we were in high school,

244
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,104
I was still trying to figure out
my sexuality,

245
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,732
so, I dressed as Mindy,
and tried to seduce her boyfriend.

246
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,235
-Hmm.
-I quickly realized I wasn't into it,

247
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,487
but Mindy found out,
and now that I have a boyfriend,

248
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,241
she probably wants to have sex with you
to get revenge. Typical sister stuff.

249
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,243
I thought sisters were doing it
for themselves.

250
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,161
I mean, what does she need me for?

can you help me move some furniture?

Just as I suspected.
You're not sexual at all.

Okay, quick update.

Mindy wants to meet me
for backyard sex at midnight,

272
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,085
and your mother knows I'm asexual.

273
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,378
She showed me her boobs.

274

00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,339
Oh, I didn't!

276
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,093
Oh, no! She'll disown me!
We gotta convince her you're super horny.

277
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,137
-How?
-If Mindy told my mom

278
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,307
that you made a pass at her,
that would prove you're not asexual.

279
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,143
Here's the plan.
We'll wait until the cock crows midnight.

280

Who is this cock?

281
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,437
When she's at the backyard,

282
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,230
I'll sneak in her room
and wear her clothes.

283
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,775
I'll pretend I'm Mindy
and tell my mother you made a pass at me.

284

Okay, this sounds a little complicated,

285
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,489

exactly this amount of complication

286

I don't want help.
Why would you do that?

I know you don't want me
doing nice things

296
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,309
because I'm not your boyfriend,
and you're a sentient wall of spikes,

297
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,103
but they want to hear you sing
at the next break.

It doesn't work that way.

303
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,531
You're used to being the star,
so good things always happen to you.

304
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,657
I'm not the star.

I can get a<i> </i>juicy season arc

Then I win an Emmy in a movie

00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,960
You know, this is actually really freeing.

326
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,005
I feel like, I can say all the things
I would never say on a date.

327
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,383
Like that I've never seen<i> The Wire,</i>
and I don't think I'm gonna.

328
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,011
Well, I'd never tell a date
that I get the <i>New York Times,</i>

329
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,388
but I only read the style section
and throw the rest away.

330
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,973
I don't have or want children,

331
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,184
but I silently judge every parent
that I see in public.

332
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,228
I sleep with a chew toy,
since I was a kid.

333
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,814
[chuckles]
I still have feelings for Diannnne.

334
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,693
Oh. That's much less fun
than the other things.

335
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,403
Uh, listen--

336
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,864
Let's just finish our meal
and go see the explosion.

337
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,451
-[Mr. Peanutbutter groans]

338
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,744
[both sigh]

339
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,246

341
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,001

[rhythmic sounds]

343
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,962
Here I come. [giggles]

344
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,465
Okay.

345
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,885
[giggles]

346
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,220
Ah! Mrs. Buenaventura!

347
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,473
I was trying to understand
how someone could be like you,

348
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,766
so I did a little research.

349
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,143
Did you know a computer can do more
than just find porn?

350
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,687
I use my laptop to flatten pie dough.

351
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,607
This concept of asexuality intrigues me.

352
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,818
I've grown tired of the whole world
thinking of me as a sex object.

353
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,238
For once in my life I would like to have
a close, intimate experience

354
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,282
that has nothing to do with sex.

355
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,283
-[shouts]
-[gasps]

356
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,911
Asexualize me
like one of your French girls, Todd.

357
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:54,828
Gulp!

358
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,914
[rhythmic sounds]

359
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,840
I can't believe he didn't show up.
Only makes me want him more.

360
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,884
Hmm.

361
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,136
Mom, are you there? It's me, Mindy.

362
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,430
You can tell
because I'm dressed like a slut, as usual.

363
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:17,977
Mindy, come down here.
I have a question only you can answer.

364
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,436
Oh, okay.

365
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,275
If you really want to be asexual,

366
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,404
first, you have to put on
every piece of clothing you own.

367
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,240
That's how we make sure
we don't look sexy.

368
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,326
So, leave me and go do that.

369
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,496
Very well, but I'll be back
to not have sex with you.

370
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,708
Ooh, I'm getting less excited
just thinking about it.

371
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,334
Hoo-hoo! Hooba, hooba.

372
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,336
Ooh.

373
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,424
-I need some advice, Mindy.
-That's me. I'm definitely Mindy.

374
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,717
So you keep saying.

375
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,970
Look, I'd like to give
your sister Yolanda this. [grunts]

376
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,304
The last barrel

377
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,142
of your great grandmother's secret recipe
personal lubricant.

378
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,686
As you know, when a Buenaventura
is about to make love

379
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,104
for the first time in our home,

380
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,024
we always give them a barrel
of the family lube.

381
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,150
Uh, well...

382
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,319
Antique lube of this purity
is worth at least $100,000.

383
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,738
Ah-ooga!

384
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,823
[rhythmic sounds]

385
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,701
Hello, baby, it's me,
your girlfriend Yolanda.

386
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,286
I came to ravage you.

387
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,415
There's something different about you,
but I can't put my finger on it.

388
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,167
Todd, take off your pants
and get in bed.

389
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,084
Wait. What?

390
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,919
My dad is about to give us
very expensive lube

391
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,379
just for having sex in this house.

392
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,089
And which sister are you?

393
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,008
What the hell are you doing in here?

394
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,303
Todd, tell Mindy to get her ass
out of here, so we can get nasty.

395
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,388
<i>I'm </i>Yolanda.
Get away from my boyfriend!

396
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,514
Don't listen to her, Todd.

397
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,142
I'm clearly Yolanda
because I'm dressed like a dumb loser.

398
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,811
I'm so confused. I'm Todd, right?

399
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,106
Maybe, this'll clear things up.
Mindy's the one who's about to die!

-[groaning, moaning]
-Oh, dear, I'm too late.

401
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,737
They're already having sex.
[sighs] They don't need the lube.

402
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,988
[Yolanda] Ouch! That hurts!

403
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,865
-Or maybe they do need the lube.
-[door opens]

404
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,784
Ha! Can't see me now, world.

405
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,995
Angelica, as I jizz and breathe,
what the hell are you wearing?

406
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,083
-Oh, no! The lube!
-Oh, dear!

407
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,460
[Mr. Buenaventura] Oh!
That's too slippery!

408
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,295
-Ho, oh, oh, oh! [grunts]
-[Todd] Oh, my God!

409
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,464
-[Mrs. Buenaventura] Ah! Oh!
-[Yolanda] Oh!

410
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,967
[Mindy] Oh, no! Our grandma's
sexily spinning in her grave.

411
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:18,639
Todd, you gotta save the lube!
Just plug the hole with your erect penis!

412
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,556
What? No.

413
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,559
It's the only thing
that'll fit the hole perfectly.

414
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,228
There has to be another way.

415
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,106
Surely it's erect since you've been
just having sex with my daughter,

416
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,858
so unless you've been deceiving me,
this whole time, in my own home,

417
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,153
there's no logical reason, for you,
not to whip out your erect penis

418
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,197
and plug the damn hole!

419
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,698
Todd, the lube!

420
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,201
I'm gonna try my big toe.
That's the penis of the foot.

421
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,577
[Yolanda] Oh, God, be careful!

422
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,830
-[Todd] Whoa! Look out!
-[Yolanda] No! Whoa!

424
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,875
-[Mindy] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-[Mr. Buenaventura] I can't look!

425
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,919

Before I start, just to give some context

429
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,975
because the song
doesn't make sense if...

430
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,685
Okay, so, it's 1712,

431
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,980
and American colonist Sybilla Masters
is perfecting her invention.

432
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,649
Can we lose the liner notes
and get to the singing?

433
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,902
I'm a producer. I can't just sit around
having conversations, all day.

No. I thought she'd be good.
I was trying to do a nice thing.

00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,967
I never had sex with him!

466
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,594
Yes, you did!
The whole school knew about it.

467
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,679
No, I didn't.

00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:08,016

You know,
it felt good to finally tell them.

00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,316
I was surprised
how cool they were with it.

472
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,568
Yeah, I kind of forgot
that despite our differences,

473
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,945
they're family and they love me.

474
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,407
So, I guess all that sneaking around
was completely pointless.

475
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,784
Hey, you're right!
What a silly waste of time.

476
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,664
-Hey, can I ask you something?
-Of course.

477
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,375
Why did you tell your family
I went to college?

478
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,670
Oh, I don't know, I guess
I just wanted you to seem impressive.

479

-Impressive to who?
-Todd... [sighs] To whom.

-Yolanda, we need to break up.
-What?

482
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,099
The only thing we have in common
is that we're asexual.

483
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:53,979
I'm sure there's a guy out there for you,
whom's smart and accomplished

484
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,857
-and whom went to college--
-And also doesn't want to have sex?

00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,443
Yeah. Probably.

486

-But what if there isn't?
-Well, then let's make a deal.

How about if neither of us meet
anybody else by the time we're a hundred,

488
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,953
we give this another shot?

00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,248
When we're a hundred? I don't know.
Are you gonna steal my dentures

490
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,709
and use them to build
some sort of motorized nutcracker,

491
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,919
but then the nutcracker's AI
becomes self-aware

492
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,048
and leads all the other dentures
in the nursing home in a toothy revolt?

493
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:25,177
-I wanna say no, but probably yes.
-[sighs]

494
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,263
Well, then, I guess I'll see you
when we're a hundred.

495
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,349
[soft, calm music playing]

496
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,019
-[Pickles shivers]
-Come on, you're shivering.

497
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,813
-Please, just take the blanket.
-No, I'm okay.

498
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,108
Are you the type of war dramatized
in <i>The Hunt for Red October?</i>

499
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,651
Because you're cold.

500
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,488
That one doesn't even make sense.
How do you hunt a month?

501
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,407
I know that it was really hard
to hear what I said in the restaurant,

502
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,952
but... I want you to know
everything about me,

503
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,079
even the hard stuff.

504
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,332
I get it. This is a bad time for you
to start a relationship.

505
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,209
[laughs] Of course it's a bad time!

506
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,919
I just signed divorce papers.

507
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,046
But I can't control
when I meet someone special.

508
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,758
So, what am I supposed to do, just pretend
I don't want to see you every night?

509
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,885
But what if I'm like the space station?

510
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,055
After a while, you get bored of me
and replace me with someone new.

511
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,640
Look, I don't know the future.

512
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,642
This could end in heartbreak
for both of us.

513
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,352
I mean, most relationships do.

514
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,563
And if I'm honest,
it's not usually me that gets bored.

515
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,566
But I'd like to see where it goes
because... I like you.

516
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,151
[chuckles] And we have fun together.

517
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,196
And every time we see each other,
I like you a little more.

518
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,827
Hmm. Hey, am I Taylor Swift's grudge
against Katy Perry, right now?

519
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,123
Because even though it makes no sense,
I want to be held for a superlong time.

520
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,000
-[Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles] Mmm.
-Mmm.

521
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,169
[romantic music playing]

522
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,048
-[phone clicks]
-[sighs]

523
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,718
[crying, sniffles]

524
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,096
-[folk rock music playing]
-[sighs]

525
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,978
-Hey, Gina.
-Hi.

526
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,188
[stammers] Look, I'm sorry.
I thought--

527
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,774
Hey, from now on,
let's just stick to the original rules

528
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,193
-and not get in each other's business.
-Yes, of course.

529
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,113
-[stammers] I'm sorry. I didn't even--
-For the record, you were right.

530
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,782
If I didn't sing there,
I would have spent the rest of my life

531
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,826
not knowing
if I ever could have made it or not.

532
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,494
Now I know. So, good.

533
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,955
You had a bad audition.
It doesn't mean that everything--

534
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,039
I said it's fine.

535
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,376
You did your good deed,
so, you can feel good about yourself.

536
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,670
-Hmm.
-I'm going to bed.

537
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,507
If you want to have sex with me, you can.
Otherwise, I'll see you in the morning.

538
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,428
O-Okay. Uh... Hmm.

539
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,679
[distant explosion]

540
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,143
[sighs]

541
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,979
[music continues]

542
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,027
-[smooching]
-[Pickles giggling]

543
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,991
[music continues]
