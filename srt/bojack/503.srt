00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,760
I think, the most important thing here

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,139
is that we're honest with each other
and ourselves. Do you agree?

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,348
Uh, yes?

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,226
It says, here, you failed
your last six health inspections.

6
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,728
-Ooh.
-How are you still in business?

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,064
I wanna say moxie?
But possibly spunk.

8
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,234
[chuckles] I can't believe
I fell asleep at your house.

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,779
-These shoots are messing up my rhythm.
-It's so weird waking up at 6:00 p.m.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,866
Don't worry. I'm not gonna make a habit
of spending the night or day.

11
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,868
I get it. We work together,
we make sex together,

12
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,161
we don't talk about feelings,

13
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,122
and yet sometimes
a begrudging respect can blossom into--

14
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,665
-Nope.
-"Blossoms into nothing"

15
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:41,833
is what I was gonna say.

16
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,918
You cut me off, so you look stupid.

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,630
Well, you look stupid when you sleep.
Look, I took some dumb pictures.

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,424
-[BoJack] All right.
-Stupid. Real stupid.

19

-[BoJack] You can delete some.
-You have a weird eye.

20

-Obsessed much?
-This is what it would look like

21
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,971
if corpses could drool. [laughs]

22
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,557
-Hi, excuse me, can I get <i>The BoJack?</i>
-What is that?

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,435
It's an off-the-menu item
for those in the know.

24
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,730
Obviously, I'm BoJack
and I always order the BoJack sandwich.

25
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,689
That's kooky.

26
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,983
Why would your name be a sandwich name?

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,569
Because I own this restaurant
and I'm a celebrity.

28
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,947
So, are all sandwiches named
after celebrities?

29
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,657
Is chicken salad a celebrity?

30
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,035
No, that's just a thing
they put in the sandwich.

31
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,328
That's not someone's name.

32
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,205
Can't it be both? My name is Pickles.

33
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,289
-What?
-I'll have a burger.

34
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,875
BoJack, I'm going to the can.
Have fun with the waitress.

-Um.
-It's me, Pickles, from before.

37
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,259
-It's cool dating a celebrity.
-Okay.

38
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,595
I'm also dating a celebrity.
Should we start a club?

39
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,223
-I call vice president.
-I'm not dating anyone.

40
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,308
And if I had to guess,
I'd say neither are you.

41
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:44,104
Guys in this town, especially celebrities,
are not exactly the settle-down type.

42
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,398
That's why I hit the jackpot with my guy.
He doesn't have a problem committing.

43
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,652
In fact,
he just got out of his third marriage.

44
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,823
A celebrity who just got divorced.
Yeah. No way he'll break your heart.

45
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,867
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter and I
are moving too fast?

46
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,744
I don't know you or your relationship,

47
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,538
but I have been around the block
a few times.

48
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,749
I was even on an ABC procedural,
called <i>The Block,</i> which aired a few times.

49
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:09,546
The key is to have zero expectations,
and then you'll never be disappointed.

50
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,713
Hmm.

51
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,382
Yeah, zero expectations,

52
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,843
which also seems to be the mantra
of this restaurant.

53
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,636

Poor girl had dreams.

58
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,325
And there's nothing more precious
than dreams.

{\an8}Sorry. My brain is kinda muddled.
It's these night shoots.

63
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,128
{\an8}I think it works.

64
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,049
{\an8}John Philbert doesn't play by the rules.
He says his stage directions out loud.

65
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,968
{\an8}It's confusing, which means
the show is daring and smart.

{\an8}-Hey, wanna go check out craft services?
-Mm-mm.

be more fun

{\an8}than hearing me rant
about the fruit spread?

69
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,352
Is your rant honeydew related?

70
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,770
It's in the honeydew area,

71
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,189
but the specifics are
what keep it fresh each time.

72

-No, keep your suit on.

{\an8}My parents are gonna be impressed
I'm dating an executive.

{\an8}Cool!
I've never impressed parents before.

{\an8}I believe that.

{\an8}Listen, I haven't told my family
I'm asexual,

84
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,926
so it might be best if, for tonight,
we just pretend we're sexually active.

85
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,803
I mean, it's a family dinner.

86
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,223
What are the odds they're going to ask
questions about our sexuality, right?

87

Right...

Because... surprise!

Oh, my God. Are you the umlaut
in ChloÃ« Sevigny's name, right now?

but I'm glad you are.

-This is a thinker.

-You'll get it later.
-Okay.

103
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,890
I have a very fun plan for tonight.

104
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,477
I just heard that they're going to blow up
the International Space Station.

105
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,981
-Oh, my God. Blow it up? Why?
-No one knows why space people do things.

106
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,191
But I thought we could road trip
out to the desert

107
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,194
and witness the explosion
in all her glory.

108

That sounds amazing!

109
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,408
I'm so glad you're as excited as I am,
and not mad at me

110
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,827
for trying to surprise you
with something nice.

111
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,456
Yeah! But... are we moving too fast?

112
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,000
{\an8}A wise lady, in the bathroom,
told me some stuff.

113
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,337
{\an8}-Ooh, she sounds smart. Better listen.
-I think her name was Hamburger.

114
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,797
{\an8}Maybe we should wait, some days,
before going on another date.

115
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,217
Okay. If that's how you feel,
you stay here and do nothing,

116
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,761
and I'll go have this amazing,

117
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,763
once-in-a-lifetime experience
all by myself.

118
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,058
It does sound cool.
I could also drive to the desert.

119
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,101
If we're both going,
we might as well carpool.

120
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,730
That's smart! But just to be clear,
we're slowing things down.

121
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,106
It's not a date.

122
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,191
[chuckles] Exactly.

123
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,068
Is this that mysterious,
brown hors d'oeuvre

last week?

125

-This is so corny.
-It's not corny.

134

I mean,
it's technically a musical about corn,

135

but it's actually sophisticated.

136
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,887
Wait a second.
Are you... into musicals?

137
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,305

[Diane] <i>Planned obsolescence.</i>
[chuckles]

164
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,134
<i>Sounds like a good description</i>
<i>of my last marriage.</i>

165
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,845
-Well, that's probably enough of this.
-No. Leave it on.

166
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,182
[Diane] <i>Now he's dating a girl</i>
<i>about 20 years younger than him.</i>

167
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,517
<i>-Honestly, she's the one I feel bad for.</i>
-[laughs]

168
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,812
-Why does she feel bad for me?
-We should put on something else!

169
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,938
You got it.

170
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,650
[DJ] <i>Coming up, we got a brand-new single</i>
<i>from Twenty-One Pilots.</i>

171
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,486
Ew, back to the podcast.

172
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,326
-Todd is the president of ad sales.
-Mm, look at you.

173
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,078
-And he went to a really good college.
-I did?

174
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,079
That's very impressive.

175
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,957
I'm afraid we don't know a lot
about the world of big business.

176
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,459
As I'm sure Yolanda has told you,

177
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,086
I'm but a humble,
best-selling, erotic novelist

178
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,547
and my wife is a world-famous,
adult, film star,

179
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,801
and Yolanda's identical twin sister,
Mindy, is a sex advice columnist.

180
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,262
Wow! Yolanda told me all of that.

181
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,975
That's all really great information,
that I was already privy to.

182
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,561
Well, the important thing is
that Yolanda is happy

183
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,233
and she's finally found a man, woman,
or object to have sex with.

184
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,194
Todd is very accomplished
at sexual intercourse. Aren't you, Todd?

185
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,656
Yeah, I'm the best at the sex.
Hooba, hooba.

186
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,657
Um...

187
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,660
-Are you trying to say "hubba, hubba"?
-Uh...

188
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,121
You know, Todd, I have a bit
of a reputation, myself. [moans]

189
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,541
-Whoa!
-Okay, we should be hitting the road.

190
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,793
Oh, but you must stay for erotic dessert.

191
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,296
You know, I saw the erotic dessert
in the kitchen.

192
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,758
Who knew you could make
such a realistic anus out of marzipan?

193
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,052
You can thank my husband.
He posed for the baker.

194
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:17,557
Wow, you know,
it really puts the "um" in "yum."

195
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,393
I insist you spend the night
and make love in my home.

196
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,978
-Uh...
-I can't think of a reason,

197
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,106
you wouldn't want to have sex
in your parents' house.

198
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,233
Unless, you don't enjoy sex.

199
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,110
[sudden sounds]

200
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:33,364
No! Of course we'll spend the night,
and... fornicate.

201
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,616
[rhythmic music]

202
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,078
Hey, I got a suggestion for that scene
where you make your big confession.

203
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,581
-Oh, yeah?
-I was thinking you could maybe confess...

204
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,416
<i>âª ...in song! âª</i>

205
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,333
-[grunts]
-Whoa, hey!

206
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,628
-BoJack, shut up and get in here.
-Okay, look at that! Found an emotion.

207
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,422
I'm gonna tell you
something very personal.

208
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,050
When I was a little girl, my mom took me
to see <i>A Kernel of Truth</i> on Broadway.

209
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:53,968
It wasn't a big hit.

210
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,971
Yeah, I know. I Googled the reviews
so I could mock you.

211
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,515
That Frank Rich could be
a real frank bitch, am I right?

212
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,642
Well, I was six and it blew my mind.

213
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,562
I spent my childhood dreaming of, one day,
getting to sing on Broadway.

214
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,397
But, I guess, I wasn't good enough.

215
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,234
So now I get steady TV work,
which is fine, and I'm fine,

216
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,194
but I still listen to that musical

217
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,780
because it reminds me of a time
when I was less jaded,

218
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,576
when I believed I could do anything,
and that makes me feel good.

219
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,328
Oh, my God, Gina.

220
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,331
I-I didn't realize how much
this musical meant to you.

221
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,168
-And that... that's even funnier!
-Oh!

222
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,377
[laughs] Oh, come on!

223
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,464
You know if this were reversed,
you'd be giving me shit.

224
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,632
Ugh!

225
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,344
Hey, Gina, I'm sorry. I was just teasing.
I was... It was... [sighs]

226
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,471
Gina, come out of the bathroom.

227
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,390
Gina? Oh, right.

228
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,688
[Laika] <i>So, he make for you</i>
<i>room, that you always have dream of,</i>

229
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,982
<i>and this is why you leave?</i>
<i>Seems like overreaction.</i>

230
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,442
[laughs] Oh, thank you!

231
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,611
[Diane] <i>Okay, we're gonna take a break.</i>

232
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,196
I'm getting kinda hungry.

233
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,823
We could stop at a restaurant,
but that's kind of a date thing.

234
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,160
Well, fast food doesn't count, right?

235
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,371
-Look, there's a KFC at the next exit.
-Perfect.

236
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,997
[piano music playing]

237
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,584
Welcome to KFC,
which stands for Kiki's French Cuisine.

238
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,627
-Hon hon hon!
-[gasps]

239
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,379
[both] Oh.

240
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,386
I'm not sure I want to wear the pajamas
your dad gave me.

241
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,304
I'm sorry you have to deal with all this.

242
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,849
Is it just me
or was your sister flirting with me?

243
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,893
Ugh, when we were in high school,

244
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,104
I was still trying to figure out
my sexuality,

245
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,732
so, I dressed as Mindy,
and tried to seduce her boyfriend.

246
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,235
-Hmm.
-I quickly realized I wasn't into it,

247
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,487
but Mindy found out,
and now that I have a boyfriend,

248
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,241
she probably wants to have sex with you
to get revenge. Typical sister stuff.

249
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,243
I thought sisters were doing it
for themselves.

250
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,161
I mean, what does she need me for?

251
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,162
-[knocking]
-Todd,

252
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,207
can you help me move some furniture?
My husband has a hernia.

253
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,376
Yeah, no, I noticed in the marzipan.

254
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,713
So, what, uh,
furniture do you want me to--

255
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,381
-[sighs]
-Oh, no! Your garment fell.

256
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,341
This must be so embarrassing for you.

257
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,719
Just as I suspected.
You're not sexual at all.

258
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,011
Like, heck I'm not.

259
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,472
Any ordinary man would be madly aroused

260
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,143
by the body that starred in every single
porn version of a John Hughes movie:

261
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,438
<i>Sixteen Cans, Titty in Pink,</i>
<i>The Breakfast Chub, Homo Bone...</i>

262
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,773
-I gotta go.
<i>-Cum Kind of Wonderful,</i>

263
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,026
<i>Penis Bueller Gets Off,</i>
<i>Planes, Trains and Autoerotic-mobiles.</i>

264
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,403
[panting]

265
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,320
[shouts]

266
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,197
When the cock crows midnight,

267
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,075
meet me under the old willow tree
in the backyard for sex.

268
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,244
-Zoinks!
-[laughs]

269
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,370
[panting]

270
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,748
Okay, quick update.

271
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,542
Mindy wants to meet me
for backyard sex at midnight,

272
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,085
and your mother knows I'm asexual.

273
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,378
She showed me her boobs.

274
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,380
Please tell me you said, "Ahh-ooga!"

275
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,339
Oh, I didn't!

276
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,093
Oh, no! She'll disown me!
We gotta convince her you're super horny.

277
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,137
-How?
-If Mindy told my mom

278
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,307
that you made a pass at her,
that would prove you're not asexual.

279
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,143
Here's the plan.
We'll wait until the cock crows midnight.

280
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,311
Who is this cock?

281
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,437
When she's at the backyard,

282
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,230
I'll sneak in her room
and wear her clothes.

283
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,775
I'll pretend I'm Mindy
and tell my mother you made a pass at me.

284
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,985
Okay, this sounds a little complicated,

285
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,489
but I think I can handle
exactly this amount of complication

286
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,117
as long as things don't become
one bit more complicated.

287
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,748
-[musical playing over earbuds]
-Hey, I'm sorry I made fun of your dream.

288
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,917
[sighs] It's okay.
Just don't tell anyone about it.

289
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,669
Good news; too late.
I talked to Flip and Princess Carolyn

290
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,421
about how you're
into this Broadway crap...

291
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,131
-What?
-...and they said maybe you can sing

292
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,925
in the nightclub episode.
Can you believe it?

293
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,511
-Oh, my God.
-It's your big break, and I helped!

294
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,137
I don't want help.
Why would you do that?

295
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,056
I know you don't want me
doing nice things

296
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,309
because I'm not your boyfriend,
and you're a sentient wall of spikes,

297
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,103
but they want to hear you sing
at the next break.

298
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,021
Here's a song!

299
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,272
<i>âª Hell, no! âª</i>

300
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,066
Gina, this is your dream,

301
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,193
and there's nothing more precious
than dreams.

302
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,653
It doesn't work that way.

303
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,531
You're used to being the star,
so good things always happen to you.

304
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,657
I'm not the star.

305
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,076
I'm the third on the call sheet
for <i>Murder Hospital,</i>

306
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,786
or <i>Who Called the Monkey Paramedics.</i>

307
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,704
And maybe if I'm lucky, when I'm 60,

308
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,082
I can get a<i> </i>juicy season arc
on the right cable show

309
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,251
where everyone goes,
"Who's this 60-year-old woman?

310
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,711
She came out of nowhere."
Then I win an Emmy in a movie

311
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,255
where I play Benjamin Bratt's mother.

312
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,466
Gina, I know, but what I'm saying is,
what if you are the star?

313
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,260
-I'm not.
-But what if you are?

314
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,555
If you don't try, you'll never know.
You'll spend the rest of your life

315
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,765
wondering if you could have made it
or not.

316
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,769
Is that what you want?
Always the Bratt's mom and never Da Brat?

317
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,020
[scoffs]

318
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,439
Okay.

319
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,732
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

320
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,527
-Just... so I don't have to wonder, right?
-Exactly.

321
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,155
I'm gonna go get ready.
This is dumb, but thank you, BoJack.

00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,000
[both munching]

325
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,960
You know, this is actually really freeing.

326
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,005
I feel like, I can say all the things
I would never say on a date.

327
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,383
Like that I've never seen<i> The Wire,</i>
and I don't think I'm gonna.

328
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,011
Well, I'd never tell a date
that I get the <i>New York Times,</i>

329
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,388
but I only read the style section
and throw the rest away.

330
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,973
I don't have or want children,

331
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,184
but I silently judge every parent
that I see in public.

332
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,228
I sleep with a chew toy,
since I was a kid.

333
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,814
[chuckles]
I still have feelings for Diannnne.

334
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,693
Oh. That's much less fun
than the other things.

335
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,403
Uh, listen--

336
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,864
Let's just finish our meal
and go see the explosion.

337
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,451
-[Mr. Peanutbutter groans]
-[both slurp]

338
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,744
[both sigh]

339
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,246
[drums beat]

340
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,249
<i>âª It's midnight! âª</i>

341
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,001
And I'm the cock.

342
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,127
[rhythmic sounds]

343
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,962
Here I come. [giggles]

344
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,465
Okay.

345
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,885
[giggles]

346
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,220
Ah! Mrs. Buenaventura!

347
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,473
I was trying to understand
how someone could be like you,

348
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,766
so I did a little research.

349
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,143
Did you know a computer can do more
than just find porn?

350
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,687
I use my laptop to flatten pie dough.

351
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,607
This concept of asexuality intrigues me.

352
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,818
I've grown tired of the whole world
thinking of me as a sex object.

353
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,238
For once in my life I would like to have
a close, intimate experience

354
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,282
that has nothing to do with sex.

355
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,283
-[shouts]
-[gasps]

356
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,911
Asexualize me
like one of your French girls, Todd.

357
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:54,828
Gulp!

358
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,914
[rhythmic sounds]

359
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,840
I can't believe he didn't show up.
Only makes me want him more.

360
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,884
Hmm.

361
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,136
Mom, are you there? It's me, Mindy.

362
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,430
You can tell
because I'm dressed like a slut, as usual.

363
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:17,977
Mindy, come down here.
I have a question only you can answer.

364
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,436
Oh, okay.

365
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,275
If you really want to be asexual,

366
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,404
first, you have to put on
every piece of clothing you own.

367
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,240
That's how we make sure
we don't look sexy.

368
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,326
So, leave me and go do that.

369
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,496
Very well, but I'll be back
to not have sex with you.

370
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,708
Ooh, I'm getting less excited
just thinking about it.

371
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,334
Hoo-hoo! Hooba, hooba.

372
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,336
Ooh.

373
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,424
-I need some advice, Mindy.
-That's me. I'm definitely Mindy.

374
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,717
So you keep saying.

375
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,970
Look, I'd like to give
your sister Yolanda this. [grunts]

376
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,304
The last barrel

377
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,142
of your great grandmother's secret recipe
personal lubricant.

378
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,686
As you know, when a Buenaventura
is about to make love

379
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,104
for the first time in our home,

380
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,024
we always give them a barrel
of the family lube.

381
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,150
Uh, well...

382
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,319
Antique lube of this purity
is worth at least $100,000.

383
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,738
Ah-ooga!

384
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,823
[rhythmic sounds]

385
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,701
Hello, baby, it's me,
your girlfriend Yolanda.

386
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,286
I came to ravage you.

387
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,415
There's something different about you,
but I can't put my finger on it.

388
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,167
Todd, take off your pants
and get in bed.

389
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,084
Wait. What?

390
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,919
My dad is about to give us
very expensive lube

391
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,379
just for having sex in this house.

392
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,089
And which sister are you?

393
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,008
What the hell are you doing in here?

394
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,303
Todd, tell Mindy to get her ass
out of here, so we can get nasty.

395
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,388
<i>I'm </i>Yolanda.
Get away from my boyfriend!

396
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,514
Don't listen to her, Todd.

397
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,142
I'm clearly Yolanda
because I'm dressed like a dumb loser.

398
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,811
I'm so confused. I'm Todd, right?

399
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,106
Maybe, this'll clear things up.
Mindy's the one who's about to die!

400
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,942
-[groaning, moaning]
-Oh, dear, I'm too late.

401
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,737
They're already having sex.
[sighs] They don't need the lube.

402
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,988
[Yolanda] Ouch! That hurts!

403
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,865
-Or maybe they do need the lube.
-[door opens]

404
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,784
Ha! Can't see me now, world.

405
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,995
Angelica, as I jizz and breathe,
what the hell are you wearing?

406
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,083
-Oh, no! The lube!
-Oh, dear!

407
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,460
[Mr. Buenaventura] Oh!
That's too slippery!

408
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,295
-Ho, oh, oh, oh! [grunts]
-[Todd] Oh, my God!

409
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,464
-[Mrs. Buenaventura] Ah! Oh!
-[Yolanda] Oh!

410
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,967
[Mindy] Oh, no! Our grandma's
sexily spinning in her grave.

411
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:18,639
Todd, you gotta save the lube!
Just plug the hole with your erect penis!

412
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,556
What? No.

413
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,559
It's the only thing
that'll fit the hole perfectly.

414
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,228
There has to be another way.

415
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,106
Surely it's erect since you've been
just having sex with my daughter,

416
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,858
so unless you've been deceiving me,
this whole time, in my own home,

417
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,153
there's no logical reason, for you,
not to whip out your erect penis

418
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,197
and plug the damn hole!

419
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,698
Todd, the lube!

420
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,201
I'm gonna try my big toe.
That's the penis of the foot.

421
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,577
[Yolanda] Oh, God, be careful!

422
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,830
-[Todd] Whoa! Look out!
-[Yolanda] No! Whoa!

423
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,289
[all shouting]

424
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,875
-[Mindy] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-[Mr. Buenaventura] I can't look!

425
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,919
[all] No!

426
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,090
-[Mindy sighing]
-[Yolanda sighs]

427
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,509
[all shouting]

428
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,265
Before I start, just to give some context

429
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,975
because the song
doesn't make sense if...

430
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,685
Okay, so, it's 1712,

431
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,980
and American colonist Sybilla Masters
is perfecting her invention.

432
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,649
Can we lose the liner notes
and get to the singing?

433
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,902
I'm a producer. I can't just sit around
having conversations, all day.

434
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,489
Oh, yeah, sorry. Of course.

Thank you. And I'm sorry. And...
[clears throat] I'm sorry.

451
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,221
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
That was weird.

452
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,097
You know what, she was nervous, and--

453
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,934
BoJack, I don't know what kind
of power games you two are playing,

454
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,227
but keep it in the bedroom.

455
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,395
That was just mean, to her and to us.

456
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,065
No. I thought she'd be good.
I was trying to do a nice thing.

457
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,360
And I would like to be judged solely
on my intentions this time.

458
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,154
[both grunting]

459
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,239
[both shouting]

460
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,492
Interloper!
You ruined our family heirloom.

461
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,162
Ah! I'm sorryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy...

462
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,002
-[both grunting]
-That's for trying to trick Todd

463
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,128
into having sex with you!

464
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,507
And that's for having sex
with my boyfriend in high school!

465
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,967
I never had sex with him!

466
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,594
Yes, you did!
The whole school knew about it.

467
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,679
No, I didn't.

468
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:08,016
I was going to, but I ran away
because I'm [shouting] asexuaaaaaaaaal!

469
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,393
[gasping]

470
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,314
You know,
it felt good to finally tell them.

471
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,316
I was surprised
how cool they were with it.

472
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,568
Yeah, I kind of forgot
that despite our differences,

473
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,945
they're family and they love me.

474
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,407
So, I guess all that sneaking around
was completely pointless.

475
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,784
Hey, you're right!
What a silly waste of time.

476
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,664
-Hey, can I ask you something?
-Of course.

477
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,375
Why did you tell your family
I went to college?

478
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,670
Oh, I don't know, I guess
I just wanted you to seem impressive.

479
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:41,550
-Impressive to who?
-Todd... [sighs] To whom.

480
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,884
[sighs]

481
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,846
-Yolanda, we need to break up.
-What?

482
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,099
The only thing we have in common
is that we're asexual.

483
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:53,979
I'm sure there's a guy out there for you,
whom's smart and accomplished

484
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,857
-and whom went to college--
-And also doesn't want to have sex?

485
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,443
Yeah. Probably.

486
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:04,364
-But what if there isn't?
-Well, then let's make a deal.

487
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,577
How about if neither of us meet
anybody else by the time we're a hundred,

488
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,953
we give this another shot?

489
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,248
When we're a hundred? I don't know.
Are you gonna steal my dentures

490
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,709
and use them to build
some sort of motorized nutcracker,

491
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,919
but then the nutcracker's AI
becomes self-aware

492
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,048
and leads all the other dentures
in the nursing home in a toothy revolt?

493
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:25,177
-I wanna say no, but probably yes.
-[sighs]

494
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,263
Well, then, I guess I'll see you
when we're a hundred.

495
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,349
[soft, calm music playing]

496
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,019
-[Pickles shivers]
-Come on, you're shivering.

497
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,813
-Please, just take the blanket.
-No, I'm okay.

498
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,108
Are you the type of war dramatized
in <i>The Hunt for Red October?</i>

499
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,651
Because you're cold.

500
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,488
That one doesn't even make sense.
How do you hunt a month?

501
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,407
I know that it was really hard
to hear what I said in the restaurant,

502
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,952
but... I want you to know
everything about me,

503
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,079
even the hard stuff.

504
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,332
I get it. This is a bad time for you
to start a relationship.

505
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,209
[laughs] Of course it's a bad time!

506
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,919
I just signed divorce papers.

507
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,046
But I can't control
when I meet someone special.

508
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,758
So, what am I supposed to do, just pretend
I don't want to see you every night?

509
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,885
But what if I'm like the space station?

510
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,055
After a while, you get bored of me
and replace me with someone new.

511
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,640
Look, I don't know the future.

512
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,642
This could end in heartbreak
for both of us.

513
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,352
I mean, most relationships do.

514
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,563
And if I'm honest,
it's not usually me that gets bored.

515
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,566
But I'd like to see where it goes
because... I like you.

516
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,151
[chuckles] And we have fun together.

517
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,196
And every time we see each other,
I like you a little more.

518
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,827
Hmm. Hey, am I Taylor Swift's grudge
against Katy Perry, right now?

519
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,123
Because even though it makes no sense,
I want to be held for a superlong time.

520
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,000
-[Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles] Mmm.
-Mmm.

521
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,169
[romantic music playing]

522
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,048
-[phone clicks]
-[sighs]

523
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,718
[crying, sniffles]

524
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,096
-[folk rock music playing]
-[sighs]

525
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,978
-Hey, Gina.
-Hi.

526
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,188
[stammers] Look, I'm sorry.
I thought--

527
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,774
Hey, from now on,
let's just stick to the original rules

528
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,193
-and not get in each other's business.
-Yes, of course.

529
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,113
-[stammers] I'm sorry. I didn't even--
-For the record, you were right.

530
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,782
If I didn't sing there,
I would have spent the rest of my life

531
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,826
not knowing
if I ever could have made it or not.

532
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,494
Now I know. So, good.

533
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,955
You had a bad audition.
It doesn't mean that everything--

534
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,039
I said it's fine.

535
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,376
You did your good deed,
so, you can feel good about yourself.

536
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,670
-Hmm.
-I'm going to bed.

537
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,507
If you want to have sex with me, you can.
Otherwise, I'll see you in the morning.

538
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,428
O-Okay. Uh... Hmm.

539
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,679
[distant explosion]

540
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,143
[sighs]

541
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,979
[music continues]

542
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,027
-[smooching]
-[Pickles giggling]

543
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,991
[music continues]
