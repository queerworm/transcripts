00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,925
[Princess Carolyn] <i>I got into</i>
<i>this business because I love stories.</i>

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,344
They comfort us, they inspire us,

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,472
they create a context
for how we experience the world.

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,266
But also, you have to be careful,

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,601
because if you spend
a lot of time with stories,

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,814
you start to believe that life
is just stories, and it's not.

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:26,234
Life is life, and that's so sad,

8
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,154
because there's so little time and...

9
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,780
what are we doing with it?

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,450
-[clocks ticking]
-Thank you.

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,201
When Princess Carolyn told me

12
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,912
we were pitching
to whattimeisitrightnow.com,

13
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,205
I was excited,

14
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,626
because in so many ways,
the story I'm about to tell is about time.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,838
And it's about time this story was told.

16
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,506
-Ooh!
-Ahh!

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,052
[Flip] <i>It's about Detective John Philbert,</i>
<i>a man from another time.</i>

00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,767
[Flip] <i>But now he finds himself</i>
<i>in a new time.</i>

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,188
-I'm sorry, did you say newt time?
-No, no, new time.

21
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,066
Oh, so it's not like a time full of newts?

22
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,233
No.

23
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,110
Unless you want it to be
a time full of newts.

24
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,697
-No, no, no, no. I'm just clarifying.
-Okay.

25
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,076
He finds himself in a time
he doesn't understand.

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,121

27

-Wait. I-- I just--

28
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,335
My mother, she's senile,
and she was drugging the coffee.

29
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,628
That's why-- Just--

30
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,255
I wanted you to know that
none of this was Hollyhock's fault.

31
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,590
[man] <i>Goodbye, BoJack.</i>

32
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,968
[Flip] <i>A time in which he is alone.</i>

33
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,931
<i>Perhaps, all this time,</i>
<i>he's been alone.</i>

34
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,226
-Except for the newts, right?
-Hmm.

35
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,061
Yeah. Except for the newts.

{\an8}[theme music playing]

37
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,371
And then it dawns on him,
his partner isn't a ghost.

38
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,497
Or is he?

39
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,041
{\an8}-Wow!
-As we like to say here,

40
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,003
{\an8}there are little hand ideas
and big hand ideas.

41
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,130
{\an8}And that's a big hand idea.

42
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,424
And you said BoJack Horseman
is attached?

43
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,342
{\an8}What? Oh, yeah.
BoJack is attached.

44
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,303
{\an8}But he's not like "attached" attached.

45
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,013
{\an8}If you want us
to get somebody better--

46
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,640
Oh, no, no, no.
We love BoJack.

47
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,685
{\an8}Yeah. We don't wanna do this
without BoJack, just to be clear.

48
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,271
{\an8}-Well--
-Oh, he's definitely attached.

49
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,690
{\an8}He signed a contract. I saw it myself.

50
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,236
{\an8}Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.
[gulps]

51
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,826
{\an8}So if you look to the left, you'll see
a charming little breakfast nook.

52
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,870
{\an8}-Oh!
-[gasps] Look at that!

53
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,455
{\an8}But if you want more natural light,

54
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,291
{\an8}you could knock down that wall
and put in these...

55
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,044
-French doors!
-That is so cool!

56
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,713
-You actually don't have to yell.
-Wait, Diane.

57
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,965
Are we in the same house right now?
I don't see you.

58
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,842
I can hear you.
I think we're close!

59
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,677
You can't see each other
in the program.

60
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,722
{\an8}So I'm invisible?
Oh, in this scenario, am I a ghost?

61
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,390
{\an8}Of a Union soldier, perhaps,

62
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,310
{\an8}who cannot rest until
his final letter is delivered!

63
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,979
And can I be
Anne of Green Gables?

64
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,689
No, you're both still you.

65
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,566
Diane, can I talk to you alone
for a moment?

66
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,901
-Oh, I can step out--
-Sure!

67
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,071
Why don't you meet me
in the guest bathroom? Ow!

68
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,364
-You don't have to.
-Where's--

69
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,824
{\an8}-Hold on. I think--
-Guys, I can just--

70
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,409
-Here we are.
-Diane?

71
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,245
No. Careful. Okay.

72
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,997
-Do you really love this house?
-Yeah, it's fine.

73
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,374
I didn't love the old house,

74
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,085
but it was your house and I moved in,
and it was great.

75
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,921
{\an8}But this is an opportunity
to build something together.

76
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,006
{\an8}Something that'll last
for the rest of our lives.

77
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,842
{\an8}Anything you want is gonna be good
with me. Just like your old house.

78
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,345
{\an8}But I don't want this to just be
another one of <i>my</i> houses.

79
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,305
{\an8}I want this to be <i>our</i> house.

80
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,766
And it will be,
because we'll both be living in it.

81
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,727
Mr. Peanutbutter,
I don't need anything fancy.

82
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,605
All that matters to me
is that I get to live with you.

83
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,691
-In the real world.
-Oh!

84
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,193
No more campaign,
no more ex-wives.

85
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,238
Just Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter,
back to normal.

86
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,949
-For the rest of our lives.
-That sounds great.

87
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,575
-We'll take it.
-One second, though,

88
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,744
-I have to use the bathroom.
-No, no, no, that's not--

Hi. Yeah, my mom is a resident.

103
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,572
I've still got a bunch of her stuff.

104
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,449
Don't put me on hold.
Just take a message--

105
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,242
[Sabrina] <i>Wait, wait!</i>
<i>You're a DNA expert?</i>

106
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,245
<i>Could I use DNA</i>
<i>to find my real family?</i>

107
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,040
[Scheck] <i>Well, sometimes,</i>
<i>DNA can be a tricky thing.</i>

108
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,624
<i>Like, for example,</i>

109
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,503
<i>was Simpson DNA found at the scene</i>
<i>of the murder of Nicole Brown?</i>

110
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,923
<i>Sure. Was it O.J. Simpson's DNA?</i>

111
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,216
-<i>Who's to say?</i>
<i>-Oh.</i>

112
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,928
<i>Maybe it was some other Simpson,</i>
<i>like his son, or his father.</i>

113
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,015
<i>There's no way to know.</i>
<i>I wouldn't worry about it.</i>

114
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,600
<i>That's too much, man--</i>

-Hey, buddy.

-Uh-oh.
-She had a long day... of drinking.

118
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,324
I figured she shouldn't
drive herself home.

119
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,617
-Good thinking.
-Yeah.

120
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,494
I was right too,
because she crashed her car.

121
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,620
What?

122
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,747
I probably should've
said something, but...

123
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,461
You need to get your shit together.

124
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,879
Wha-- Where am I?

125
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,049
Okay, so you know how you're always
giving pep talks to people,

126
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,343
telling them they need
to get their shit together?

127
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:30,056
Well, this is me giving you
the Princess Carolyn pep talk.

128
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,936
-Why am I tied up in the woods?
-So you can't escape my wise words.

129
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,979
Is that not part of it?
I couldn't remember.

130
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,273
It doesn't matter.
It's all over for me.

131
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,442
When it gets out
I faked BoJack's signature,

132
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,236
the deal's gonna fall apart.

133
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,571
There goes my reputation, my career--

134
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,033
Well, there's more to life
than just your career, isn't there?

135
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,493
-Is there?
-Isn't there?

136
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,786
I have nothing!

137
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,831
Oh! This pep talk is going
in the wrong direction.

138
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,542
Do you know how hard it is
to start a family at my age?

139
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,962
-To find a guy at my age?
-You don't need a guy to start a family.

140
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,965
You're Princess Carolyn.
You can do anything.

141
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,466
No, I can't.

142
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,678
Look, the woods are dark and scary,

143
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,848
but the only way out is through.

144
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,267
I'm sorry.
I got distracted by the woods.

145
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,186
-Um, what were we talking about?
-No, you're right.

146
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,522
The only way out is through.

147
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,900
I gotta talk to BoJack.
I gotta stop feeling sorry for myself.

148
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,193
I'm Princess Carolyn.

149
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,361
That's the spirit!

150
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,115
As my blood type always says,
"B" positive!

151
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,533
-What was that?
-I don't know.

152
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,201
-Oh!
-Oh!

153
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,328
-Hey, Doctor Picarello.
-[groaning]

154
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,038
Doctor Picarello, are you okay?

155

-[growling]
-Todd?

-[all snarling]
-[drill whirring]

157
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,632
So it turns out Vice Chancellor
Laughing Gassy got rabies

158
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,634
from quarrelling with an old raccoon.

159
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,472
And then he started biting everyone,
and now a bunch of them have rabies.

160
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,183
Who could have predicted
my innocent clown dentist venture

161
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:59,145
-could turn into something so terrifying?
-I don't see how this concerns me.

162
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,190
Yolanda, the only reason
they're in the woods at all

163
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,316
is because of you.

164
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,527
If people find out the Better
Business Bureau is behind this,

165
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,279
you don't think you'll be getting a buzz

166
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,449
from the Business Branch
of the Board of Better Bureaus?

167
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,368
You're right! We have to do something
before someone gets hurt.

168
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,580
Call me four out of five dentists,
because I agree.

169
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,707
What?

170
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,338
Here we are.
The rest of our lives.

171
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,590
Yeah, wow.

172
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,051
-Do you wanna go to Hawaii?
-What? Right now?

173
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,762
Yeah! When's the last time
we did something impulsive?

174
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,014
Well, you did run for governor
without giving it much--

175
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,726
I just think we could use a vacation.
Things have been so crazy this last year.

176
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,562
Before we start the rest of our lives,
haven't we earned a break?

177
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,191
All right. Let's go to Hawaii! They got
that bridge that's just sitting there.

178
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,236
-We might as well use it.
-All right! Hawaii, here we come!

179
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,906
-All right! Hawaii!
-Hawaii!

180
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,492
-[horns honking]
-[Diane] Oh.

181
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,994
-[Mr. Peanutbutter sighs]
-[gulls squawking]

182
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,040
So, listen.

183
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,876
As you know, one of the differences
between agents and managers--

184
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,837
-Oh, my God. Stop. Please stop.
-I'm producing a new TV show.

185
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,675
It's a phenomenal script which may
or may not involve ghost or newts.

186
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,135
-Does it involve ghost or newts?
-It may!

187
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,055
-You haven't read it, have you?
-Read it? I'm producing it!

188
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,560
-Right.
-It's this gritty, hard-boiled mystery--

189
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,979
-Ugh! I'm so sick of mysteries.
-Right, well--

190
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,564
They're impossible to figure out.

191
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,942
Then all of a sudden, some random detail
makes the hero remember a conversation

192
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,529
that totally re-contextualizes everything,
and then it all magically comes together.

193
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,197
-Sure, but--
-It's such bullshit.

194
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,158
Where's my random detail that's gonna
suddenly make everything make sense?

195
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,243
Because I would love that.

196
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:41,038
Well, this script is really special,
and everyone wants to play the lead,

197
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,291
from Matthew McConaughey
to Matthew Perry.

198
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,418
-Matthew Perry?
-Yeah. But I was thinking--

199
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,628
Hold on. Matthew Perry...

200
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:53,301
Hey, BoJack, which one
of these pictures more says,

201
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:58,347
"This daughter looks like a cool lady
that I wanna have in my life"?

202
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,348
Why do you ask?

203
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,310
I'm writing a letter to my mom
and I want to include a picture.

204
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,353
I'm going to send it
to the adoption agency.

205
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,356
Maybe if they still have her address
on file, they can forward it to her.

206
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,651
Seems like a long shot. How about
a better strategy is, don't do that,

207
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,112
and then you won't be disappointed
when it doesn't work out?

208
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,448
I'm trying everything.
I don't wanna look back at this

209
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,742
and feel like the end
of "Chandler's List," you know?

210
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,785
-You mean <i>Schindler's List</i>.
-Never saw it.

211
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,287
I'm talking about "Chandler's List,"

212
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,664
the sketch from when Matthew Perry
hosted <i>SNL.</i>

213
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,957
-Remind me?
-Okay.

214
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,250
So it's Chandler from <i>Friends,</i>

215
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,502
and it's World War II,
and he's got this list.

216
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,421
And the whole time, he's like,
"I'm Chandler!

217
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,048
Could I <i>have</i> a bigger list?"

218
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,508
But then at the end, the war's over,
and he's like...

219
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,011
-"Could I have had a bigger list?"
-Whoa.

220
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,764
He's haunted because he feels
like he could have done more.

221
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,015
You know, he's like,

222
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,726
"Could I <i>be</i> any more feeling
like I could have done more?"

223
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,480
I have to go.

224
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,650
Look, I'm trying to do you a favor here!
[groans]

225
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,736
[door slams]

226
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,196
[panting]

227
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,324
Oh. [gasps]

228
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,285
Huh.

229
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,627
Huh?

230
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,173
-[snarling]
-[music playing]

231
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,224
Shh!

232
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,770
Yes. Get the magazine.

233
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,773
What a fine addition
to your waiting room.

234
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,609
-Oh, no!
-[drill whirrs]

235
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,528
[music playing at faster tempo]

236
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,281
-[screaming]
-[drill whirring]

237
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,242
[grunting, groaning]

238
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,372
-Oh, God.
-[clown growling]

239
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,832
What are we gonna do, Todd?

240
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,750
-Guys, let's talk this out.
-[drill whirring]

241
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,043
[horn honking]

242
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,928
Run. Ouchie! Ouchie!

243
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,265
[both panting]

244
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,559
-Oh, man.
-I've never run that fast in my life.

245
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,477
-Me neither.
-I gotta get in better shape.

246
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,897
I keep saying I'm gonna run more,
but it's just so hard to stay motivated.

247
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,315
Hmm.

248
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,526
Don't "hmm." I'm talking to you.

249
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,199
-[horns honking]
-[tires screeching]

250
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,661
-Can you not start and stop so much?
-I can't control the traffic, darling.

251
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:29,331
When the car in front of me starts,
I start. And when it stops, I stop.

252
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,293
Maybe you don't have to start
every time the car in front of you starts,

253
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,253
because you know it's gonna
stop again anyway.

254
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,006
-You could leave a little space.
-Okay.

255
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,009
-[engine rumbles]
-And another car just cut in front of me

256
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,136
because I left a little space.

257
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,221
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm getting carsick.

258
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,015
Okay. I'm gonna get some gas.

259
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,565
All right. I got the lowdown.

260
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,151
First of all, very important,
I got you this flattened penny.

261
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,195
I will cherish it always.

262
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,406
-I'm sorry for being annoying before.
-Don't worry about it.

263
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,532
Here's the deal.

264
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,951
With this traffic,
we can stay on our current trajectory

265
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,038
and get to Hawaii just in time
to spend two luxurious hours

266
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,582
at the Honolulu Stilton,
and then turn around and come back,

267
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,251
or we can hang out here
at the Thrifty Lodge

268
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,004
at this charming halfway to Hawaii
rest area and gas park.

269
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,967
Excuse me,
we would like your finest room, please.

270
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,763
-All our rooms are the same.
-What kind of cuisine is on premises?

271
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,182
There's a deli at the gas station
across the street.

272
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,809
-And what are your spa hours?
-There's no spa.

273
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,979
Okay, if I wanted to have a big gala,
could I use your grand ballroom for that,

274
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,689
or is that booked months in advance?

275
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,733
I could settle for a demi-ballroom
in a pinch,

276
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,152
but attire will be formal,
I don't wanna upstage the venue.

277
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,488
We have zero ballrooms
in this Thrifty Lodge.

278
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,281
I see. This will do nicely.

279
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,661
Didn't you tell me once
you always wanted a ballroom?

280
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,997
Actually, no. [chuckles]
What I wanted was a Belle-room.

281
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,333
What is that? Like a room full of bells?

282
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,545
It's a room full of big books,
with big windows and a ladder,

283
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,380
like Belle got in <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

284
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,383
-And it's called a Belle-room?
-It's called a library.

285
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,261
But I called it a Belle-room
because it was magical.

286
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,763
And since it was a name I made up
for a room that wasn't real,

287
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,390
that meant that it was just mine.

288
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,100
That's adora-Belle.

289
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,310
-[woman] Hey, Seaborn! Seaborn!
-What's that?

290
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,396
You're Seaborn's Seahorse Milk, right?

291
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,730
Ha! That's right.

292
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,566
Oh, man! Can I get a shellfie?

293
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,609
That's like a shellfish version
of a selfie.

294
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,195
-Hmm?
-Go, take a picture.

295
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,363
It'll make their day.

296
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,323
-You sure? You don't mind?
-I'll be in the room.

297
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,200
Don't stay out
with your new friends too late.

298
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,120
Hey, guys. I'm coming down.
What other of my things do you like?

299
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,038
[man] Wow, yeah!

300
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,418
Okay, so...

301
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,473
[snoring]

302
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,480
Oh.

303
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,815
Hey.

304
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,116
[Jose] So the supplier said,
"I really oughta give Iowa a try."

305
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,202
But I said, "Buddy, Kansas City's
about as far as I can go."

306
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,580
Long story short,
we're meeting in St. Louis.

307
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,707
-[pounding on door]
-Huh?

308
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,167
-Hey!
-I need to talk to Hollyhock!

309
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,002
-She's not here.
-You have to let me see her.

310
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,338
Please, I flew all the way here
and it's Wichita,

311
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,341
so it's not like
I got other shit to do in Wichita.

312
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,009
No one told you to come here.

313
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,969
You're the one
who likes foreign movies, right?

314
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,388
That part in <i>Amelie,</i>
where she listens to the guy's story?

315
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,599
This is that part.
And I'm the guy with the story.

316
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,684
And I need you to be Amelie right now.

317
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,355
I don't like foreign movies.
I like foreign <i>films.</i>

318
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,773
Okay, you're impossible.

319
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,858
The rest of you, please,
just listen for a second.

320
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,819
I know you hate me.
But for Hollyhock, please, listen.

321
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,405
[clears throat]

322
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,950
Whole time she's staying with me,
it doesn't make sense, right?

323
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,701
If I'm her father,
where is her mother?

324
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,787
Well, that's an extremely
heteronormative way

325
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,830
-of looking at things.
-No, I'm saying, medically,

326
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,792
where is the woman I had sex with
that made her be born?

327
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,252
Right? That's why Hollyhock
came to L.A. in the first place.

328
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,504
Okay...

329
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,298
But then I thought,
"What if I'm not her father?"

330
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,092
You're not her father.
<i>We </i>are her fathers.

331
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,760
You're her fathers. Yeah. I know, I know.

332
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,971
Eight of you, each have
your own cute thing, I get it.

333
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,264
My point is, Hollyhock and I
have the same DNA,

334
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,517
but that doesn't mean I'm her father.

335
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,978
You're not.
Because being a father isn't just--

336
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,271
God, I feel like you are
willfully misunderstanding me.

337
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,608
What I am saying is,
I'm not even her father biologically.

338
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,986
-Excuse me?
-My father is her father.

339
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,320
-What?
-Huh?

340
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,656
[BoJack] <i>I went to every hospital</i>
<i>and clerk house in L.A.</i>

341
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,867
<i>I waited in lines, filled out forms,</i>
<i>talked to anyone who would talk to me.</i>

342
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,537
<i>I wouldn't rest until I knew</i>
<i>I'd done everything I could.</i>

343
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,831
<i>But there was no record</i>
<i>of a little horse girl</i>

344
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,416
<i>born on Hollyhock's birthday...</i>

345
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,583
Okay, so?

346
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,336
...in L.A., because Hollyhock
wasn't born in L.A.

347
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,171
She was born in San Francisco.

348
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,091
<i>I got a little bug in my brain</i>
<i>that my father knocked up the help.</i>

349
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,052
<i>So I went up there, and I did</i>
<i>the whole thing again, and I found it.</i>

350
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,971
<i>The birth certificate</i>
<i>with her mother's name,</i>

351
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,849
<i>clear as day, Henrietta Platchkey.</i>

352
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,642
-That's--
-But where is she now, right?

353
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,686
<i>Looked her up on Facebook.</i>
<i>I know what you think:</i>

354
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,646
<i>"BoJack Horseman</i>
<i>has a Facebook account?"</i>

355
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,190
<i>Obviously, I didn't,</i>
<i>because the Internet is for nerds.</i>

356
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,736
<i>But I know it's a good way to find people,</i>
<i>so I set up an account, and I found her.</i>

357
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,904
<i>She lives in Minneapolis.</i>
<i>She's a nurse.</i>

358
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,698
<i>Her phone number</i>
<i>was on her Facebook page.</i>

359
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,034
And I wanted Hollyhock to have it.

360
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,869
-You did all that?
-She has to know.

361
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,788
You don't have to tell her I was here.
I'll stay out of her life forever.

362
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,416
You can tell her I'm an asshole.
Say you found this on your own.

363
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,586
I don't care, but you have
to tell her. Please.

-Yeah?

369
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,230
Yeah. But you need to leave.
Right now.

370
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,399
[sighs] Okay.

371
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,156
Welcome to the best
workout routine in L.A.

372
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,158
Nothing motivates like fear.

373
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,286
So remember, once you're in there,
don't stop running.

374
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,830
If the clown dentists catch you,
they will bite you,

375
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,665
and they have very healthy teeth.

376
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,001
[chuckles] Okay, but not really, right?

377
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,964
Nope, really. They will actually bite you,
and they do actually have rabies.

378
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,092
Wow, guess I'm gonna
really have to run.

379
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,135
No more excuses. This is great.

380
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,555
Exactly! And don't forget...
have fun in there!

381
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,182
-[woman] Whoo-hoo!
-[man] Let's do this.

382
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,351
-[man 2] Let's go.
-[all screaming]

383
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,148
Well, you did it.
You made a better business.

384
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,483
<i>We </i>did it.

385
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,902
Between your no-nonsense approach

386
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,446
and my the-regular-amount-of-nonsense
approach,

387
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,115
we make a pretty good team.

388
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,242
Yes. I'm going back to my job.

389
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,285
But if anything happens here
and you need me,

390
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,830
or if you just wanna hang out again,

391
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,082
grab a drink,
you should call me sometime.

392
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:49,336
Oh, um, I should tell you,
I'm actually asexual.

393
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,965
Yeah, I know. So am I.
That's why I'm asking you out.

394
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,552
-Oh! Uh, okay.
-Okay. Goodbye.

395
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,806
Huh.

396
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,606
[doorbell chimes, whinnies]

397
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,486
-I have to talk to you.
-Make yourself at home.

398
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,405
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

399
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,448
I promised you'd do this show.

400
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,451
I don't know why. I just...
I needed something--

401
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,828
-I'll do it.
-What?

402
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,039
You want me to do it, I'll do it.
God knows you've done enough for me.

403
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,501
-[groans]
-What's wrong? I said I'd do it.

404
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,130
It's just really hard to need people.

405
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,424
Yeah, but...

406
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,759
Yeah. Thank you.

407
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,470
Eh, it'll be good for me
to get out of the house anyway.

408
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,638
You want a drink?

409
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,974
-Water.
-Water? "Water" you pregnant?

410
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,018
[chuckles] Very much not so.

411
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,812
-I heard you got a new boyfriend.
-We broke up.

412
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,148
Oh. Sounds like an asshole.

413
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:55,152
He was actually the first guy I ever dated
who wasn't an asshole.

414
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:59,031
-Well, onwards and upwards.
-I heard you had a kid living with you?

415
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,950
No. She's got these adopted dads.

416
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,620
They're total dicks,
but they take care of her.

417
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,830
-She'll have a good life.
-Oh.

418
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,583
-You ever think of adopting?
-[sighs]

419
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,878
-More and more lately.
-You should. You'd be a good mom.

420
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,048
-The world needs good moms.
-I'll take that under advisement.

421
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,176
Well, I guess I'll see you on set.

422
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,094
I'm looking forward to it.

423
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:31,146
Now, back to normal.
Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.

424
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,317
-Here we are. The rest of our lives.
-I wanna show you something.

425
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,446
I had the contractor put this together
while we were gone. Close your eyes.

426
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,157
-[Diane] Okay...
-All right. Open them.

427
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,202
-Oh, my God! It's--
-Pretty cool, huh?

428
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,664
-Why would you do this?
-It's what you always wanted, right?

429
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,166
It's too much. I didn't want it like this.

430
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,252
-Like what?
-I don't know. I'm sorry.

431
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,963
This is great. I'm sorry.

432
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,839
Why would you think I would like this?

433
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,133
Because you told me
this is what you always dreamed of?

434
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,386
I don't like big gestures like this!

435
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,846
-How many times have I--?
-Yeah, but this is--

436
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,975
This was a fantasy,
something that belonged to me.

437
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,351
Why couldn't you have asked me--

438
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,688
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever try
to surprise you, or do nice things.

439
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,940
Do you know how much it cost
to get 5,000 fake books?

440
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,360
-So I'm the bitch? Is that what you--
-I'm sorry that I wanted to make our home

441
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,445
feel like a place
that you would want to live

442
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,072
that could be yours as well as mine!

443
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,032
Why is that so important to you?

444
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,243
Because otherwise,
it feels like you're a guest.

445
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,371
And unlike the talking candlestick
in the aforementioned Disney film,

446
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,039
I don't want you to be that.

447
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,291
It makes me feel shitty.

448
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,834
Like you're just visiting here,

449
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,919
until the next thing
and you're gonna leave me

450
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,879
when you get bored
or you find something better.

451
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,756
Like Katrina did. Like Jessica did.

452
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,384
You can't use your ex-wives against me.

453
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,219
I'm just telling you how I feel.

454
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,555
I was trying to do a nice thing for you.

455
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,099
This is not how I thought
this would go at all.

456
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,434
[sighs]

457
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,270
Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.
Back to normal, right?

458
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,397
[chuckles]

459
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,192
You know, sometimes I feel like
our marriage is like a magic eye poster.

460
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,111
-I love those things.
-I know.

461
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:05,032
And it's messy. And at first glance,
it doesn't seem to make any sense.

462
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,701
And it's hard to figure out.

463
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,453
But sometimes,

464
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,539
if you squint at it just right,
everything lines up,

465
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:17,627
and it's the most perfect...
beautiful, amazing thing.

466
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,546
Yeah. I know what you mean.

467
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,506
But...

468
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,717
[voice breaks] I'm so tired of squinting.

469
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,678
[crying]

470
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,138
Oh...

471
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,568
What?

472
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,196
-Oh, Christ.
-[ringtone chiming]

473
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,700
-Hollyhock.
-Hi.

474
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,202
<i>-How are you?</i>
-Listen...

475
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,496
I wanted to thank you
for finding my mom.

476
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,206
-They told you?
-Not exactly.

477
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,000
They have this secret dad language
they think I don't understand,

478
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,211
but it's super obvious
what they're saying.

479
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,464
[chuckles] You're too smart
for your own good.

480
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,301
So, yeah, I've been talking
to Henrietta on the phone

481
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,261
and she seems really nice.

482
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,387
Really? Wow!

483
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,766
I'm gonna visit her in Minneapolis.
I'm at the airport right now.

484
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,351
Right now? That's incredible.

485
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,062
No, what's incredible
is this place at the airport

486
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,481
charged me ten dollars
for a cup of fruit.

487
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,941
<i>-What?</i>
-And get this.

488
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,068
<i>It's like 90 percent honeydew.</i>

489
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,694
Are you kidding me? Why?

490
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:29,199
What on-the-go jet-setter's demanding
more honeydew in his or her fruit cup?

491
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,201
Nobody ever wants honeydew,
it's always there.

492
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,703
It is literally the worst part
of everything it's in.

493
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,705
It's like the Jared Leto of fruits.

494
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,082
Thank you. Exactly.

495
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,083
Mmm.

496
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,627
Well...

497
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,880
Anyway,
they're about to start boarding, so...

498
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,758
Hollyhock, I'm sorry
I didn't take better care of you.

499
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,011
I shouldn't have moved in with you.
It was maybe too much too fast.

500
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,264
-Yeah.
<i>-But it wasn't all bad.</i>

501
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,225
I mean, yeah,
I got secretly drugged for months on end

502
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,562
to the point I was living a nightmare
in which I couldn't recognize my own body

503
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,897
or understand what was happening
to my brain, but,

504
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,733
other than that,
it was a pretty chill experience.

505
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,943
I should have protected you.

506
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,028
I really wanted to be
a good dad to you, Hollyhock.

507
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,614
Well, turns out you're not my dad at all.

508
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,616
Yeah. Good thing, I guess.

509
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,910
Yeah. Good thing.

510
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:19,708
So, uh, Minneapolis, huh?
Did you rent a car or a cab?

511
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,377
BoJack, it's all taken care of.
I gotta go.

512
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,962
Is there anything, uh, I can do?

513
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,464
I can upgrade your seats, or...
or send you better fruit.

514
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,926
BoJack, look,
I never needed you to be a dad.

515
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,261
I'm going to be fine.

516
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,763
<i>I told you from the beginning,</i>
<i>I have eight dads.</i>

517
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,100
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

518
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:41,021
But... I've never had a brother.
