-It's fine.

166
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,256
I can talk to you and also judge
these women's bodies at the same time.

167
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,174
What do you want?

168
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,885
Okay, well, first of all,
the script is great.

169
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,847
Really top-notch stuff.
I love the whole... thing of it.

170
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,309
I just wanted to clarify some things
about Philbert as a character.

171
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,227
Mm-hmm.

172
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,145
Yeah, okay, on page three,

173
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,482
is it necessary that Philbert
can only orgasm if he's listening

174
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,193
-to a recording of his dead wife's voice?
-Yes.

175
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,820
Okay, well, what about this thing
on page eight

176
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,115
where he goes to a strip club and just
sits in the back with a sketch-pad

177
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,160
and draws the strippers,
while a Leonard Cohen song plays?

178
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,078
What about it?

179
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,622
It's just that
all of these half-naked women.

180
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,249
I mean, I understand it.

181
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:06,170
I'm just worried it might come across
as gratuitous and, uh, male-gazey,

182
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,588
which I know it isn't!

183
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,800
Hmm. You know what? You girls can go home.

184
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,009
The stripper scene's cut.

185
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:12,927
-No.
-Seriously?

186
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,179
-Uh, oh. Uh...
-How am I gonna feed my baby?

187
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,099
I just got an idea for something better.

188
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:23,229
So, instead of drawing strippers naked,
you're just going to draw Gina naked.

189
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,146
[BoJack] Uh...

190
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,901
Gina, BoJack was concerned the old scene
was gratuitous and male-gazey.

191
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,611
Oh, he was? BoJack said that?

192
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,781
[Flip] This is much more interesting
and motivated by character.

193
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:38,828
And since it's motivated by character,
that means it's not gratuitous.

194
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,163
Thank you for the note, BoJack,
you really helped.

195
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,374
Yeah. Thanks, BoJack, for helping.

196
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,251
-Oh, um...
-[Flip] Can we get some ice?

197
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,712
Can we get some nipple ice for Gina?

198
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,135
-So, you're the famous Yolanda.
-I am not famous.

199
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,887
You might have me confused
with another more famous Yolanda.

200
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,932
I know, I-I just meant
because Todd talks about you so much,

201
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,684
I feel like you're famous.

202
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,019
Oh, well, that was not clear.

203
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,605
Okay. Todd, why don't you say things now?

204
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,857
Steve, you still fixing up your truck?

205
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,068
You're thinking of Emily's old boyfriend,
firefighter Steve D'Marco.

206
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,155
Yeah, I'm firefighter Steve D'Mazio.
We're very different.

207
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,324
But I do have a truck,
and I'm fixing it up.

208
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,575
So, thanks for asking.

209
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,911
I created a dating app
for firefighters to meet me.

210
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,538
-Looks like it worked.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

211
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,167
Hey! We should create a dating app
for asexuals.

212
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,377
Why would asexuals want a dating app?

213
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,005
Well, not all asexuals are aromantic.

214
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,090
-Uh...
-Think of it this way.

215
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,802
One could be: A, Romantic,
or B, Aromantic,

216
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:41,140
while also being A, Sexual, or B, Asexual.

217
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,976
So you could be BB, or BA.

218
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,729
As for me, see AB, see?

219
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,647
Uh...

220
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,776
So, even within the one percent
of the population that's asexual,

221
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,986
there's an even smaller percentage

222
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,614
that is still looking
for romantic companionship.

223
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,116
Seems like a pretty thin user base
for an app.

224
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,412
But without it, asexual romantics
might end up settling for just whatever

225
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,708
other asexual romantics they might meet,
even if they have nothing else in common.

226
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,294
-Well, anyway--
-Yeah, but maybe it's good

227
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,631
if they have nothing in common
because then they can help each other grow

228
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:17,134
and change, and become fuller,
more well-rounded people.

229
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,511
Yeah, that's true.

230
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:22,682
So, Todd, are you still doing
that rabid clown-dentist exercise thing?

231
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:28,145
Oh, no, that whole thing kinda fell apart
when the clowns got loose.

232
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,272
[mystery music]

233
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,691
Huh?

234
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,611
<i>I know you killed your wife, Philbert,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna prove it.</i>

235
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,029
[Mr. Peanutbutter] Wow!

236
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,240
<i>Don't finger me for a murderer, Malone.</i>

237
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,991
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>where those fingers have been.</i>

238
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,326
[Mr. Peanutbutter] Ooh!

239
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,578
Well, how about I show you?

240
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,580
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] Wow!
-[Flip] Cut!

241
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,875
Someone keeps shouting "Wow" and "Ooh."

242
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,086
You guys are doing a bang-up job
over here.

243
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,506
So sayeth Caesar! King of the apes!

244
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,216
Look, man, I know what you're doing, okay?

245
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,802
You're trying to punish me.
Just don't punish Gina.

246
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,512
I'm not trying to punish anyone.

247
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:05,266
I'm just trying to make a good show
that's brilliant and unprecedented.

248
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,560
It sounds like you guys
are basically on the same page.

249
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,270
You're the only one with a problem here.

250
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,897
-Gina is fine with it.
-Gina is not fine with it.

251
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,650
You guys, you're almost saying
exactly the same thing.

252
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,235
Except one of you is saying "not".

253
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,530
Gina, do you have a problem
with the nudity in this scene?

254
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,491
It's great. It's brilliant, unprecedented.
I'm gonna get some potatoes.

255
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,744
You see? Everyone's fine with it but you.

256
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,953
So, can we drop it?

257
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,914
I know you're used to being
the most important person on set.

258
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,583
-This is not about me.
-It's weird for you

259
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,959
that I don't need to listen.

260
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,043
-I'm not--
-Hey, hey--

261
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,254
But if you actually have notes
that are helpful,

262
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,424
I would love to hear them when
you're done swinging your dick around.

263
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,342
-No, this is not about my dick.
-Okay, fellas...

264
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,013
-Well, maybe it should be about your dick.
-What?

265
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,891
Since you're so concerned
about the male gaze,

266
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,560
let's give the females
something to gaze at.

267
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,313
We'll do a full-frontal nude scene
with you.

268
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,315
This is compromise!
This is working together.

269
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,109
-Well, hold on.
-Fully exposed, Philbert reaches up

270
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,862
-with both hands to screw in a light bulb.
-Yes!

271
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,990
He totters in little circles
on a tiny stool.

272
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:07,787
-Wouldn't I just turn my wrist?
-Full body rotation. We see everything.

273
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,788
Now we're talking!

274
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,498
-No, we're not! Princess--
-I'm on it.

275
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,333
Flip, BoJack can only do this scene

276
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,709
-if he can wear a T-shirt.
-What?

277
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,961
He's very self-conscious
about his belly area.

278
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,756
No, I'm self-conscious
about my penis area.

279
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,674
He can't wear a shirt.

280
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,301
It's about being vulnerable.

281
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:26,722
We see every fold and imperfection
of his wrinkled, saggy body.

282
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,890
-Hey!
-So we like him.

283
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,017
But he has to be fully erect
so we respect him.

284
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,560
-What?
-We'll shoot it tomorrow.

285
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,354
-Yeah.
-Unless you don't like this idea,

286
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,564
in which case, we can go back
to what we were doing.

287
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,482
-Right.
-Well--

288
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,692
So, you would be admitting
that you don't actually care

289
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,362
about the male gaze
and you were only giving me notes

290
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,988
to hear yourself talk.

291
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,990
But that's not it, right?

292
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:45,950
-Right.
-Great.

293
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,618
-Shooting is tomorrow afternoon.
-Okay.

294
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,621
-I'll send the waxing kit over tonight.
-Philbert waxes?

295
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,708
Not for cosmetic purposes.
He just wants to feel something.

296
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,003
-[chuckles]
-Huh?

297
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,257
I like your friend.
It's impressive how she creates companies.

298
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,759
And her boyfriend has
an interesting career as well.

299
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,053
Yeah! And you have an interesting career.

300
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,306
Hey! The three of you
all have interesting careers.

301
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,016
That is so cool!

302
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,018
Todd, do you ever feel weird

303
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,271
that you have
no discernible life direction?

304
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,647
-No.
-Let me rephrase that.

305
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,775
I feel weird that you have
no discernible life direction.

306
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,026
-Oh.
-I mean...

307
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,530
-What am I supposed to tell people?
-A story? A joke?

308
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,409
Compliments are things
people like being told sometimes.

309
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:33,414
I'm sorry. How was your day?
Did you end up meeting with that frog?

310
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,166
No, I just stayed home
and looked at stuff on the Internet.

311
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,293
Oh.

312
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,591
-[gasps]
-Hello, Princess Carolyn.

313
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,093
You're not Princess Carolyn.
Why are you not Princess Carolyn?

314
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,929
-She gets home pretty late.
-I came all this way for nothing?

315
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,639
I brought my spinny chair
and everything!

316
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,976
Well, if you want something to do,
you could help me find a job.

317
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,687
-You're looking for a job?
-I spent all day looking!

318
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,856
First, I thought
I should get a newspaper to find one,

319
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,066
but then I was, like,
"Where do I find a newspaper?"

320
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,318
-Uh.
-So, I looked it up.

321
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,278
And a map came up of my local area.

322
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,864
So, then I thought about
how I know this area pretty well,

323
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,283
but there's all kinds of areas
I don't know.

324
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,160
-Like South Africa.
-Okay.

325
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,787
-And then I thought about Charlize Theron.
-Uh, right.

326
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,081
And then I thought about
that movie <i>Monster.</i>

327
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,500
And then I was, like,
"What year did that come out?"

328
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,294
-So I went to Monster.com...
-[pc clacking]

329
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,671
...to look up facts
about the movie <i>Monster,</i>

330
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,424
and it turns out
they have job postings there!

331
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,426
-[Bojack sups]
-What a time to be alive!

332
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,762
Hey! A posting for
WhatTimeIsItRightNow.com!

333
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,056
[Todd] Oh, a janitor job.

334
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,017
I've always wanted to... Janet!

335
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,686
I just got an amazing idea.
Interview for that job!

336
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,022
Uh... Was that your amazing idea?

337
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,191
Because I feel, like,
it kinda came out of the room.

338
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,652
When you get in the building,
say you need to use the WC.

339
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,446
Then you'll sneak into the office
of one of the network execs.

340
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,282
Go into their email
and send a message to Flip McVicker

341
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,618
telling him he can't film
any more nude scenes

342
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,662
because they're derivative
and unnecessary,

343
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,040
-especially the nude scenes involving me.
-You are throwing a lotta words at me.

344
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,502
Todd, don't you get it?
We're gonna save the show!

345
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,420
You're on a show?

346
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,884
This is a very impressive resume.

347
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,680
Yep. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must adjourn to the restroom.

348
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,475
You founded a ride-share app.
You built and managed your own theme park.

349
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,186
And you were, briefly,
Governor of California!

350
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,689
I was also the director
of a <i>Star Wars</i> movie,

351
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,024
but they fired me
over "creative differences."

352
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,151
Now about that restroom...

353
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,904
Hold on. You are way overqualified
to be a janitor.

354
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,659
-Okay. But I do actually need to go.
-Oh, you need to go, all right.

355
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,704
-Straight to the top of this company!
-[gasps]

356
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,124
We're ready for you on set, Mr. Horseman.

357
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,041
Just a minute.

358
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,585
-[cell phone rings]
-All right! Todd, did you do it?

359
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,587
[woman on phone]
<i>Hold please for Mr. Chavez.</i>

360
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,632
-Already I don't like this development.
-[Todd] <i>Hey! Good news, bad news.</i>

361
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,469
<i>Good news is I'm now President</i>

362
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,097

-WhatTimeIsItGo.
-[BoJack] <i>What?</i>

364
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,184
Bad news is I can't help you.

365
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,271
Why not? You're their boss now.
You can tell them what to do.

366
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:06,567
I could, but I'm no leader at all
if I can't delegate authority.

367
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,611
<i>-I need to focus on big picture stuff.</i>
-[grinding]

368
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,905
Loving that picture.
Can we get it even bigger?

369
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,784
Ugh, Todd, your good-hearted naiveté
has once again conspired

370
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,246
with outrageous happenstance
to completely dick me over!

371
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,832
Have you tried just talking
to the show runner?

372
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,293
In my experience,
I've found it's best to shoot straight,

373
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,880
in the boardroom and on the driving range.

374
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,298
-[grunts]
-<i> I gotta jet.</i>

375
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,926
It's Susie in HRs birthday
and if I don't show up to these things,

376
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,470
people talk, you know what I mean?

377
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,096
-I never do!
-[cell phone beeps]

378
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,058
-Hey, Flip, we need to talk.
-Okay.

379
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,809
-I'm not doing the naked scene.
-What?

380
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,936
The only reason you wrote it
is to embarrass me.

381
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,981
BoJack, I'm not writing scenes
for my television show

382
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,151
and also directing them
in order to teach you lessons

383
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,195
or send you secret messages.

384
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,155
I'm just trying to make a good show.

385
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,784
-Why do you keep making it so difficult?
-I'm making it difficult?

386
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,036
I have done nothing,
but be a friend to you.

387
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,749
I actually called my mom last night
and told her that I made a friend on set.

388
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,251
Do you wanna make me a liar to my mother?

389
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,546
-What? Ew. Weird.
-Take off that robe and go to set.

390
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,924
-No.
-Take off that robe right now.

391
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,302
Why can't you act like a professional
and get naked?

392
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,348
Because it's dumb!
This whole show is duuuuuuumb!

393
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,265
What?

394
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,851
It's confusing, it's overwritten,
and it's poorly lit.

395
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,230
The darkness is a metaphor for darkness!

396
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,856
And worst of all, it's boring!

397
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,819
It has nothing to say,
and it says that nothing badly!

398
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,656
[inhales] Let me tell you
how this is going to be.

399
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,324
I am the show creator

400
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,786
and if I want your character to get naked,
he gets naked.

401
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,540
If I want him to speak only in Korean,
you're learning Korean.

402
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,583
If I want your character to shit his pants

403
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,628
and walk around with shit in his pants
for the rest of the season,

404
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,296
-you will do just that.
-[mystery music]

405
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,340
-Oh, come on.
-You signed a contract.

406
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,509
And that means I am your god.

407
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,886
You will please your god,

408
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,850
and if I don't see your ass on set
then I will see your ass in court.

409
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,143
Do you understand?

410
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,561
[groans]

411
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,188
That's a good note about the lighting.
I'll take a look at that.

412
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,193
Good news! We found a birth mother!

413
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,862
Really? A-already?

414
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,113
She came in yesterday.

415
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,824
She's giving her baby
to a sweet couple in Illinois.

416
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,242
-What?
-Oh...

417
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,870
Did you think we found
a birth mother for you?

418
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,371
Conceited much?

419
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,124
Tracy, I’m spending a lot of money
to be here with you

420
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,668
and I'm putting myself
in a very vulnerable position.

421
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,171
Is there any way
you can be a little more thoughtful

422
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,964
with the way you manage me as a client?

423
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,925
It sounds like what you're looking for
is an adoption manager.

424
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,136
This is an adoption agency.

425
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,013
-Do you not know the difference?
-[sighs]

426
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,556
-[cell phone buzzes]
-What?

427
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,933
Princess Carolyn, I overplayed my hand.

428
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,810
BoJack and I got into a fight.

429
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,229
-And he never showed up on set.
-What?

430
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,606
-[horn blaring]
-What?

431
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:55,194
[BoJack] Princess Carolyyyyyyyn,
I need to talk to youuuuuu.

432
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,111
[sighs]

433
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,907
-BoJack.
-Hold on, I got a thing with a chair.

434
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,241
How did you even find me?

435
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,119
Duh. Bought a burner phone,
slipped it into your purse,

436
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,704
and then used the Find My Phone app.

437
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,663
How thoughtful.

438
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,248
[deep voice] Hello, Princess Carolyn.

439
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,208
Oh, God.

440
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,084
I have a plan and I need your help.

441
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,754
-I found out his mom has a fake leg.
-Who's mom?

442
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:18,133
Flip. I'm gonna seduce her, steal her leg,
and then smack him across the face with it

443
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,927
until he chokes on his own blood.

444
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,055
It's subtle,
but I think he'll get the message.

445
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,098
BoJack, what are you trying
to accomplish here?

446
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,934
I-I don't want to do the show.

447
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,894
So you're gonna run away
like you always do?

448
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,896
Yeah. I never wanted to do this show!

449
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,482
-You faked my signature!
-And I told you that,

450
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,526
and you said, "Okay" because you wanted
to be a good friend to me!

451
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,446
So, you can't get points for that
and then resent me for it now.

452
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,699
-It's not about you! I don't like him!
-Oh, Flip's not that bad.

453
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,327
He's just insecure
and is overcompensating a little.

454
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,371
I know that must be
a foreign concept for you.

455
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,248
No, not Flip. Philbert.

456
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,210
He-he's a drunk.
He's an asshole. I don't want to be him.

457
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,671
So, maybe don't be the drunk asshole.

458
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,341
Maybe this time, you have a good attitude
and you don't drink so much

459
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,009
and you show up at your call time.

460
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:06,181
And then you put on the Philbert costume
and you <i>pretend </i>to be this other guy.

461
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,476
And then when you're done shooting,
you take off your costume

462
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,938
and you're BoJack, the star of the show
that everybody likes.

463
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,147
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

464
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,777
Hey, why are we at an adoption agency?
Are you adopting something?

465
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,654
-I'm trying to.
-Oh.

466
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,740
So, can you keep it together
for the next ten weeks

467
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,493
so I don't need to come to set,
every day, to put out fires?

468
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,787
You think you could do that? For me?

469
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:32,958
[inhales]

470
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,918
[exhales]

471
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:36,962
[Flip] Action.

472
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,090
[Diane] Hey, stranger.

473
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,262
It sounds like you had an amazing trip.

474
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,639
I did. What have you been up to?

475
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,058
Well, I did play Julius Caesar
in a pizza commercial

476
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,979
that they're going to... [chuckles]
...get this, show in movie theaters.

477
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,106
Wow, look at you. Pizza.

478
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,983
<i>Et Cru-Dités?</i>

479
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,359
-What?
-That was my line.

480
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,613
I played Little Caesar's dad, Big Caesar,
in the back story part of the commercial,

481
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,034
which is funny because most commercials
don't even have a back story part.

482
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,494
Also, Little Caesar's
doesn't sell crudités.

483
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,289
Oh, man, my part's definitely going
to get cut, huh?

484
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,249
Just like the real Caesar!

485
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,792
Hey, that's right!

486
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,213
-Well, here's your place.
-[horns honking]

487
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,507
Yep. Here it is.

488
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,594
Well, anyway, I signed the papers.

489
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,804
Oh. Great!

490
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,890
Yeah, so if it all looks good to you
and your lawyer,

491
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,351
you can sign it too
and then it'll be official.

492
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,935
Divorce completed.

493
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,730
-Yay.
-We did it.

494
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,607
Take that, our marriage!

495
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,778
-Well, I guess I'll see you around?
-Yeah.

496
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,905
-I was going to--
-Sorry.

497
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,074
-[both laughing]
-Sorry. Just go all the way.

498
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,700
-Well, bye.
-Cool.

-[Flip] We got it.

502
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,919
What's that for? We've all seen me naked.

503
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,338
Can't put the genie
back in the bottle now, baby.

504
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,339
[crew laughing]

505
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,673
Thanks anyway, Judy.

506
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,967
This is great. Any other work environment

507
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,886
{\an8}and this would be considered
sexual harassment.

508
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,596

-Ooh, Cadbury Creme Eggs.

509

{\an8}Yes, please!
Whoops. Gonna need new yogurt.

511
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,103

said, "If that's Ansel Elgort,

516
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,534
then who's Alden Ehrenreich?"

517
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,078
-And then I said, <i>''Gesundheit''</i>

518
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,415
-Flip! You made it.
-Yeah.

519
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,418
Jesus Christ, your house really does look
like Philbert's.

520
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,336
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

521
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,173
Thanks for being so cool today
about the naked stuff.

522
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,091
Yeah. Sure.

523
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,927
Those chicks always make
such a big deal about their bodies.

524
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,387
Maybe now that you've done it,

525
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,306
Gina won't complain so much
next time we make her do it.

526
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,476
-Well, no, she didn't complain.
-Whatever. Doesn't matter.

527
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,478
-Everything worked out.
-Yeah.

528
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,314
Listen, I'm sorry I flew off
the handle earlier

529
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,483
and tried to remove your robe by force.

530
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,861
This is my first show
and I'm still figuring out

531
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,529
how to strike the right tone.

532
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,615
No, of course, I'm just trying
to help you fulfill your vision.

533
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,826
Yeah. The main thing
you gotta know about me

534
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,787
is just don't take things so personal,
you know what I mean?

535
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,913
Uh, yeah.

536
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,374
Everything we're doing over
these next ten weeks,

537
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,128

it's not about you, you know?

538
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,422
-It's Philbert.
-Yeah. Right.

539
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,882
