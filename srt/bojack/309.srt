1
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,772
- [sighs]
- [cell phone rings]

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,691
BoJack! Beautiful day, huh?

3
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,985
Perfect day to go outside,
not read the trades

4
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,030
or talk to anyone in the industry
or watch entertainment television

5
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,324
or have a gut feeling about the ratings
for your television show last night.

6
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,369
- Princess Carolyn, I'm dying.
- You read the trades.

7
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,122
My heart is in my stomach,
my stomach is in my butt,

8
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,041
and my butt ran away with the spoon.

9
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,252
That makes sense
because your butt is quite a dish.

10
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,087
Can you come over? I need you.

11
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,547
[sighs]

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,342
What the...?

13
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,723
I ordered a few feel better pizzas
to feel better. It did not work.

14
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,768
Then I sprinkled happy pills on them,
and washed it all down

15
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,229
with a "Please, God, make my pain go away"
vermouth and ice cream float.

16
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,523
- Somehow I feel worse.
- That's a real mystery.

17
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,985
My show was terrible.
Why did I insist on a mockumentary format?

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,113
It's already an overused trope now,
in 2007.

19
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:16,159
Mockumentary is not a trope,
it's a device for storytelling.

20
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,871
And your show is daring and cutting edge.
People just aren't ready.

21
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,332
Yeah, people! It's not me.

22
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,375
It's the people that are the problem!

23
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,670
Everyone's dumb and I am great.
Why do I always forget that?

24
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,838
That's the spirit.

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,883
I'm starting to think this show is
the best thing that happened to me.

26
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:32,801
- Really?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,720
It made me realize you're the best thing
that happened to me,

28
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,348
with your sexy cat eyes
and your cute little hair curl.

29
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,892
You look like a soft serve
strawberry ice cream.

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,395
BoJack, we can't. I'm your agent.

31
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,024
You are so much more than that.
You're my lighthouse, my Garmin.

32
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,652
You're the little plastic table
they put in pizza boxes

33
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,862
to keep the pizza from getting smushed.

34
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,364
You're Princess Carolyn.

35
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,242
[both moan]

36
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,747
Don't you break my heart,
BoJack Horseman.

37
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,124
- What?
- What? Nothing.

38
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,627
- Did you just say something to me?
- No, I was just being wistful, I guess.

39
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,547
Well, can you be wistful a little quieter?

40
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,925
- Not everyone is interested in your wist.
- Okay, BoJack.

41
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,346
- You smell nice.
- Thanks, BoJack.

42
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,745
{\an8}[Carolyn laughs]

43
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,831
{\an8}Okay, gotta go. I'm about to meet
my most important client.

44
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,751
{\an8}- I know you're not really on the phone.
- Bye, Mr. President.

45
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,087
{\an8}Give my love to your basketball friends.
You too.

46
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,590
{\an8}Should we get dinner,
or are you just thinking drinks?

47
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,967
{\an8}- I'm not planning on staying long.
- Okay.

48
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,763
{\an8}I'm glad you wanted to meet,
because I am so pumped to tell you

49
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,474
{\an8}all about the exciting projects
I'm lining up for you.

50
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,516
{\an8}That won't be necessary.

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,561
{\an8}Once you get your Oscar nom,
we'll have our pick. That's the key.

52
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,064
{\an8}You think Halle Berry
would've been offered <i>Catwoman</i>

53
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,357
{\an8}if she wasn't an Oscar winner?

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,609
{\an8}We just gotta find you your <i>Catwoman.</i>

55
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,277
{\an8}I'm not sure if a <i>Catwoman</i>

56
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,030
{\an8}is really the best thing
for my career right now.

57
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,783
{\an8}Right, well, like I said,
we are getting lots of offers.

58
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:02,951
{\an8}Listen, Princess Carolyn--

59
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,162
{\an8}<i>Signore </i>Horseman!
<i>Principessa </i>Carolina!

60
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,206
{\an8}Sandro, how you doing,
you handsome devil?

61
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,709
To be honest I am, how you say,
sweating bull's nets.

62
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,753
- You mean sweating bullets?
- I don't think so.

63
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,506
Sweating bullets.
How does that make the sense?

64
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,258
How does sweating bull's nets
make sense?

65
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,136
{\an8}I don't want to be caught in bull's nets.
He may try to kiss me.

66
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,642
{\an8}I prefer kissing cows. No judgment,
just a preference. I love kissing cows!

67
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,519
{\an8}Don't tell my wife. I'm kidding!

68
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,396
She knows. She's a cow!

69
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,066
And I only kiss her.
[laughs]

70
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,401
Okay, very good.

71
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,444
Haven't you lived in America for 30 years?

72
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,698
Ignore him. Why are you
sweating bullets and/or nets?

73
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:46,953
Because there is a restaurant critic
here tonight.

74
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,790
Very interesting.

75
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,501
Critics are the worst.
That's my review of critics.

76
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,586
Two thumbs down! Four percent fresh!

77
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,214
One star! You all eat a flat butt!

78
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,259
Did you not know there was a critic here?
You own this place.

79
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,594
I never see you do anything
to help run it.

80
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,346
This place runs itself. Right, Sandro?

81
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,267
My wife and children and therapy man
may not agree so much,

82
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,060
but if you say so, <i>Signore </i>Horseman.

83
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,604
Even his wife and kids
and therapy man agree.

84
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:18,151
Well, as the Black Guy Pete say,
"Tonight's gonna be a good night."

85
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,819
Please. Enjoy.

86
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,905
I know you're not happy about
what happened with the Kelsey project.

87
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,284
I pushed a little too hard to get you
the money you deserve.

88
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:30,163
What can I say? Sometimes I'm too good
of an agent, so deals fall apart.

89
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,540
That's a thing that happens
when agents are really good.

90
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,916
- That's not--
- Moving forward!

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,502
I know you're not happy
with how I handled <i>Ethan Around.</i>

92
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,087
- Or didn't handle it.
- Bygones!

93
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,007
It was because I was busy
getting you the <i>Pegasus </i>movie,

94
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,426
which I know you did not get,
but trust me,

95
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,138
you'll see not getting these movies was
the best thing that ever happened to you.

96
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,224
Onwards and upwards!
Tally ho! To the stars!

97
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,477
Okay, you're forcing me to use the cards.

98
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,358
"Princess Carolyn, clear throat,
I have been very disappointed--"

99
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,027
Ring! Hello, Your Highness.

100
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,780
It's a king, I have to take this.
In the bathroom.

101
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,492
Oh, fish, oh, fish!

102
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,535
[woman] Who's out there?
Are you talking to me?

103
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,204
No.
[sighs]

104
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,122
All right, Pink Lady, think.

105
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,541
- [woman] Are you talking to me?
- Are you a pink lady?

106
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,503
[woman] I was a Pink Lady in my high
school's production of <i>Grease.</i>

107
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,297
- Were you Rizzo?
- [woman] No, Jan.

108
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,007
Then don't waste my time.

109
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,848
Now, let us bow our heads and bray.

110
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,767
[all bray]

111
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,441
[grunts]

112
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,735
[whispers]

113
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,070
Yes, right away!

114
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:50,368
So back to what you were--

115
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,787
- Oh, my goodness, what is this?
- Yeah, what is this?

116
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,541
<i>Happy 23 years working together</i>

117
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,417
<i>- Join me</i>
- Oh, my God.

118
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,628
<i>- Twenty-two-three, 23 years</i>
<i>- Twenty-three years</i>

119
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,671
You're making this up.

120
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,299
<i>Happy 23 years working together</i>
<i>Can you believe this?</i>

121
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,177
<i>- Two plus three equals 23</i>
- This is just stream of consciousness.

122
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,887
<i>Twenty-three years working together!</i>

123
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,098
<i>Twenty-three years</i>

124
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,017
Okay, cool.

125
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,522
Can you believe it, BoJack?
It's been almost a quarter of a century.

126
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,816
Talking on the phone
pretty much every day,

127
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,985
sharing our deepest dreams and secrets,

128
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,988
being there for each other
through all of it, bosom friends,

129
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,531
<i>Anne of Green Gables</i> style.

130
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,409
Let's toast to another 23 years.
What do you say?

131
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,911
- You're fired.
- Uh-- Oh.

132
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,789
I can't believe this. You're firing me?

133
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,957
- Me?
- What? No.

134
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,960
You have no idea,
everything I do around here!

135
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,337
- Half the kitchen staff is my family.
- No.

136
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,214
- Honestly, just--
- I detest you!

137
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,550
I hope you rot in the hell!

138
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,012
- We're headed down a road that--
- You washed-up has-been no-good joke!

139
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,264
You are the opposite of an onion,

140
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:57,018
because if I cut you, I am no gonna cry.

141
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,436
Well, now you are fired.

142
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,648
Good luck finding another charming
first-generation Italian immigrant

143
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:07,612
with this kind of darling accent,
who makes equally delightful malapropisms!

144
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,490
You, sir, have just cut off your nose

145
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,284
and thrown Sprite in your face!

146
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:18,039
I am a classic stereotype
that is tough to come by nowadays,

147
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,501
because Italians don't emigrate
so much to America no more.

148
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,794
Botticelli, Barbarelli, Beetle Bailey!

149
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,756
Modigliani, Masaccio, Marmaduke!

150
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,674
<i>Avanti,</i> all of you! <i>Andiamo!</i>

151
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,593
[laughs nervously]

152
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,512
So that was weird, huh?

153
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,932
Please stop looking at me.

154
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,184
Too bad about Sandro, huh?

155
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,020
You're the one who's fired, obviously.

156
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,773
Right.

157
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,610
Ryan Murphy is doing a re-imagining
of <i>The Life and Times of Harriet Tubman.</i>

158
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,363
But in this version, she's a tub-man,

159
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,074
with the comparative strength
and agility of a tub!

160
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,700
- PC.
- He's looking for someone

161
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,119
to play the Underground
Railroad conductor.

162
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,121
Great, but you don't represent me anymore.

163
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,415
Okay, I get it. I'm fired.

164
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,001
You're gonna spend a couple of days
being mad at me,

165
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,922
then I'll get you another gig, and you'll
be my client again, just like every time.

166
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,508
Can we get past the part
where you're mad at me

167
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,261
and get to the part where
you're stealing General Lee's plutonium

168
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,055
to fuel your subterranean
steam-punk slave-tram?

169
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,808
"It's best, for both of us,

170
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,103
if we end this relationship
once and for all."

171
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,939
I'm sorry I screwed up,
you don't have to read off the--

172
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,401
"You take me for granted, made decisions
that were against my wishes,

173
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:32,071
and worst of all
she's got my globes a-warming!"

174
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,490
- How did that get in there?
- What is that?

175
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,826
A punch line to a joke
from the roast of January Jones.

176
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,620
- A global warming joke?
- It's an important issue. Here we go.

177
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,497
"Our relationship no longer has any--"

178
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,916
"January has only gotten hotter and hot--"
Nope.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,211
- Were you at the roast of January Jones?
- No, but I wrote some jokes

180
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,171
in case someone got sick
and they needed a backup.

181
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,216
Do you even know January Jones?
Why would they call you?

182
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,762
I guess I thought that my agent could
get me in the mix if Jason Sudeikis--

183
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,723
How did these get out of order?

184
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,891
So in the joke,
are the globes your balls?

185
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,144
And they get warm
when you see January Jones?

186
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,478
Is that how balls work?

187
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,397
I don't know. It's a work in progress.

188
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,857
Professional integrity!

189
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,610
"Our relationship no longer
has any professional integrity.

190
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,695
So it's gotta end. Stand to leave."

191
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,196
Shouldn't have read that part.

192
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,116
"When you reflect on this,
you'll see it's best for us.

193
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,243
Exit restaurant." Goddamn it.

194
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,079
Wow, that was--
I don't know what that was.

195
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,664
Hey! Where are you going?

196
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,295
- Who gave you this idea? Spanakopita?
- This has nothing to do with Ana.

197
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,880
Here you go, sir.

198
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,299
- I'll get it!
- You two are b'thumping.

199
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,884
Now you do whatever she says?

200
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,218
- Is that what's happening?
- No.

201
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,180
No, you're not b'thumping or no,
you're not doing whatever she says?

202
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,932
- I'm not doing whatever she says.
- So you <i>are </i>b'thumping.

203
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:46,312
I understand from context what you mean,
but there's no way b'thumping is a thing.

204
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,229
I'll get it!

205
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,316
You don't have to do everything
your little falafel pocket tells you to.

206
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,153
- You screwed up!
- Once! In 23 years!

207
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,071
I'll get 'em.

208
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,282
All these years I carried you,
when no one wanted to work with you.

209
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,284
I still managed to get you jobs.

210
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,370
And then you would flake,
or sabotage them,

211
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:06,248
or get wrapped up in some crisis
or emergency or vague sadness.

212
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,627
Everyone told me to dump you--
my bosses, film execs, directors,

213
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,505
they all told me you were washed up,
a nobody, a has-been,

214
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,883
- a joke, too portly for TV.
- Too portly for TV? Who said that?

215
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,718
- It doesn't matter.
- It does. Who said it?

216
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:22,098
- Luis Guzman.
- Luis Guzman said I'm too portly for TV?

217
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,517
You're right, BoJack.
This is for the best.

218
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,853
I no longer have to lug your talentless,
self-centered, self-sabotaging,

219
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,022
dead-weight carcass
of faded talent around my neck.

220
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,732
- Hey.
- Thank you for firing me.

221
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,318
I'm gonna go pour myself
a little celebratory potato juice,

222
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,238
because this is the best goddamn
thing that's ever happened to me.

223
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,907
Hey! Hey! Hey!

224
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,577
[groans]

225
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,745
Ha ha! I'll get it.

226
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,373
You do not talk to me like that
and walk away.

227
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,041
Oh, no? What's happening?

228
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,670
This is so weird. I'm walking away,
even though you told me not to.

229
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,588
Right, I don't work for you anymore.

230
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,841
- Hey!
- Excuse me, Mr. Horseman?

231
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,760
- Not now.
- We have a slight problem in the kitchen.

232
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,179
- Where is everybody?
- That's the problem. They all quit.

233
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,598
The kitchen's backed up with orders.
No one's getting food.

234
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,308
And the critic is growing very impatient.

235
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,979
Writing that down...

236
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,440
- Just do what you normally do.
- But there's no chef.

237
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,401
Tonight's your lucky night.
You just got promoted.

238
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,779
But I don't want to be a chef.
<i>I want to sing</i>

239
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,158
Kidding. I'm actually just happy
being a waiter. I'm not my job.

240
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,786
- A lot of people think that--
- You're the chef! Start cheffing!

241
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,704
Oh.

242
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,504
What? Fifty teeth?
Get out of here. Let me see.

243
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,590
Would you look at that.

244
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,592
You're thrilled
to have me out of your life?

245
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,095
- I was such a burden all those years.
- Can I close my mouth now?

246
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,014
- Know what I think?
- Don't wanna hear it.

247
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,640
You like being there to rescue me.

248
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,435
- I close my mouth, okay?
- Nobody cares!

249
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,228
- Okay--
- Nope, I'm still counting.

250
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,147
You like it when I'm a mess.

251
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,107
Because it makes you feel good
about yourself.

252
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,067
Guess what? I never asked for that.

253
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,694
You ask all the time.

254
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,197
You have never not been asking me
to rescue you.

255
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,073
"Princess Carolyn, help me!

256
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,452
I slept with the gaffer's wife
and now he's not lighting me properly.

257
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,039
Princess Carolyn, I threw up
on Elle Fanning in a bounce house.

258
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,958
Princess Carolyn,
why am I such a big stupid asshole?"

259
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,419
Okay, great, more abuse.
Right on schedule.

260
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,545
Oh, that's abuse?

261
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,589
"BoJack, you're such
a big, stupid asshole.

262
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,258
BoJack, why were you even
in the bounce house, dummy?

263
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,386
BoJack, you wasted my thirties!"

264
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,764
I never said you wasted my thirties.

265
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,599
Didn't have to, you're always saying it.

266
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:33,145
And I don't like being around you,
because I feel bad.

267
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,856
You make me feel bad.

268
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,901
So this isn't about me being a bad agent.

269
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,903
It's about a lot of things.

270
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,072
- Where are you going?
- Away.

271
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,740
Hey, listen, man.

272
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,993
I don't wanna get in the middle of this,
it's none of my business,

273
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,663
but I just have to say
I love that sweater.

274
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,581
- Can you give it to me?
- What? No.

275
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,792
I held my mouth open a really long time.

276
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,419
- What does that have to do--?
- You're not being fair,

277
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,171
to me or Princess Katniss.

278
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,422
- Who?
- Your friend.

279
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,509
You've forgotten her already?
Typical BoSchwack.

280
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,843
That's enough out of you.

281
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,388
It's all right,
you're gonna get through this.

282
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,848
- You're gonna get through this.
- [woman] Are you okay?

283
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,268
Are you okay?
You've been in there a long time.

284
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,228
[woman] I left for a while and came back.

285
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,022
Just so you know,
this wasn't an easy decision.

286
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,483
- This is the ladies' room!
- [woman] What's going on out there?

287
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,360
Are you watching a movie?

288
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,153
I agonized over this. Ask Ana.

289
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,824
- So you did talk about it with Ana.
- Yeah. I respect her opinion.

290
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,202
[shouts]

291
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,830
Paws not claws! Paws not claws!

292
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,124
God, you're strong.

293
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,006
[BoJack groans]

294
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,219
This is exactly the kind of
unprofessionalism I'm talking about.

295
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,015
- You want to talk about professionalism?
- Yes, I do.

296
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,686
But not here.

297
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,108
You say you want professionalism?
Bullshit.

298
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,944
You want a mommy
you can slide your dick in.

299
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,322
I can want that
and also want professionalism.

300
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,199
A sex-mommy who keeps her boundaries,
is that too much to ask?

301
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,619
Is there a single woman
you've worked with

302
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,872
who you haven't tried
to groggily thrust yourself into?

303
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,583
Is it any wonder
I don't want to be around you?

304
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,919
All you do is tell me
I'm a terrible person.

305
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,922
Please, you're such
a self-pitying masochist,

306
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,549
I could say ten nice things
and one mean thing,

307
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,343
you would only hear the one mean thing.

308
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,678
I'd love it
if you said ten nice things to me.

309
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,681
- I can say nice things.
- Ready when you are.

310
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,726
Does self-pitying masochist count,
or are we starting from scratch?

311
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,270
Okay, one-- I'm freezing my whiskers off.

312
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,523
- You have a natural charisma.
- You hesitated, that means it's a lie.

313
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,525
Two, you are loved by millions.

314
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,445
That's not a compliment.
So is Kim Jong Un and Teri Hatcher.

315
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,030
I got this. I got this.

316
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,115
Pre-heat oven?
Where's the pre-heat button?

317
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,992
Excuse me? Waiter?

318
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,370
Where are my family's
double-fudge cheese pies?

319
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,747
I'm not your waiter anymore.
I'm the chef.

320
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,626
- Then who's our waiter?
- You're the waiter now.

321
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,961
I can't be a waiter.

322
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,463
I have a very important
business meeting tomorrow.

323
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:08,050
You get someone else to do it.
I'm the chef and whatever I say goes!

324
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,469
Okay. Who gets these
soy balls and onion cubes?

325
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,054
Table eight.
Deliver those soy balls, soldier.

326
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,472
You got it, boss.

327
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,517
Number six.
You know how to make me laugh.

328
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,269
So I'm a clown to you?
Like Joe Pesci in <i>Home Alone?</i>

329
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,855
[laughs] You recognize
you're being impossible, right?

330
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,443
- I don't know how you put up with me.
- I didn't put up with you.

331
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,947
I liked being with you.
And I don't regret it.

332
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,616
I don't regret the trip to the Bahamas.

333
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,285
Or the bracelet you bought me
for my 38th birthday.

334
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,537
Or when my dad died

335
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,456
and you came to the funeral
with me and held my hand.

336
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,418
I'm doing this for both of us.
You understand?

337
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,421
- Did you ever love me? At all?
- I don't-- I'm not--

338
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,801
You know that I don't do
the whole love thing.

339
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:55,139
Either you end up hurting someone
or they hurt you. So, what's the point?

340
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,390
Yeah.

341
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,101
This sucks.

342
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,104
I did this to myself. I do this to myself.

343
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,523
- Why do I do this to myself?
- I don't know.

344
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,567
Maybe if you're good at putting out fires,

345
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,777
you just run from fire to fire
and don't really think about--

346
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,820
[screams]

347
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:13,407
Oh, God, I don't wanna be a chef!
I want to be not on fire!

348
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,077
- We gotta put out that fire!
- I hate Mondays!

349
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,665
I figured out how to pre-heat the oven.

350
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,543
This night has been a disaster.

351
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,838
The good news is I got my kid
to prep my important meeting at work.

352
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,299
The bad news is
all the customers went home.

353
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,633
They didn't like the screaming

354
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,303
and felt like their food
was a little too "on fire".

355
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,680
- It's called a char, dumbshits.
- The critic's still here.

356
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,224
Oh, oh, oh!

357
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,560
She still wants her mushroom risotto.

358
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,564
I don't know how to make risotto.

359
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,690
I know how.

360
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,609
What are you doing? No, go home.

361
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,278
You're right. What am I doing?

362
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,613
All right.

363
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,325
Good luck.

364
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,791
<i>Keep driving, keep driving</i>

365
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,668
<i>Girl, don't turn that car around</i>

366
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,547
<i>Break your pattern</i>
<i>Of needing to fix other people</i>

367
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,424
<i>Just keep on driving away...</i>

368
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,967
KEEP DRIVING

369
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,471
Who do they write these songs for?

370
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:22,643
<i>Don't go back to the restaurant,</i>
<i>Princess Carolyn</i>

371
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,562
<i>Just keep driving away</i>

372
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,943
Goddamn it.

373
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,655
How should I know?
Do I look like an expert in cooking oils?

374
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,324
We have to choose!
We're running out of time.

375
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,494
- Olive. You wanna use olive oil.
- What are you doing?

376
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,871
Let me do this.
You'll burn the place to the ground.

377
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,083
Fine. This isn't one of those things
where you save my ass

378
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,418
so I feel obligated to give you
your job back.

379
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,130
I know you have no sense
of obligation to me.

380
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,342
Ooh, slam. I'm sorry,
I'd rather not get involved.

381
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,177
Can I get you some more water?

382
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,596
You look lovely. It's a great blouse.

383
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,640
Mom, I wanna go home.

384
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,892
This is a very important night
for the restaurant.

385
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,479
How are we coming on the sales meeting?
Did you get the big conference room?

386
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,441
Winslow wants the big conference room
for his presentation to corporate.

387
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,528
You get back on that phone
and you get me that big room.

388
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,405
Okay, Mom.

389
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,658
The secret is stirring continuously.

390
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,161
Right, so that's the secret.

391
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,706
I'm gonna go roll some more soy balls.

392
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,208
- Thanks for your help.
- Sure.

393
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,169
How do you know how to do this?

394
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,296
Mom was a live-in maid for a rich family.

395
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,465
She had a little trouble
bending her elbow too much.

396
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,928
Unless I wanted us to be on the street,
I had to cover for her, a lot.

397
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,765
That rich family loved Italian food
and champagne fountains.

398
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,060
And cocaine. And private jets.
And screaming at each other.

399
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,646
"Who threw my cocaine
in the champagne fountain?"

400
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,316
- So standard rich people stuff?
- I guess.

401
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,903
- How come you never told me that?
- I did.

402
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,822
It's okay. I know
you never remember anything.

403
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,867
That's not true.
I remember the first time we met.

404
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,120
I went to see Marv. You were
at the desk in front of his office.

405
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,582
I thought you were cute and you said,
"It's good to see you again."

406
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,253
- So I guess we'd met before.
- That was the third time we met.

407
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,341
The first time was when I was an intern.
I delivered a script to your house.

408
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,136
You were passed out in the yard,
covered in tapioca pudding.

409
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,972
I hosed you down, dragged you inside,
covered you with a blanket.

410
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,600
- Really? I don't remember that.
- Shocker.

411
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,020
So you've gone from daughter of a maid
to head of your own company.

412
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,314
The company's not doing so hot.

413
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,775
- Don't try to guilt me.
- It's not your fault.

414
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,153
Turns out being an agent and running
an agency are two different skills.

415
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,865
It's like asking a really delicious tomato
to make you a tomato sandwich.

416
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,743
How's a tomato gonna make you
a sandwich? He's got no arms.

417
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,537
You'll figure it out. Princess Carolyn
always lands on her feet.

418
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,916
But I don't even know why I'm doing it.
Does any of it matter?

419
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,002
Why are you an agent at all
if it makes you so miserable?

420
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,254
Because I'm good at it.

421
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,216
I mean, stuff hasn't been hitting lately.
But, usually, I'm really good at it.

422
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,843
Just 'cause you're good at something
doesn't mean you have to do it.

423
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,846
I'm good at driving sober,
but I don't relish the opportunity.

424
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,308
But what else would I do?
Who else would I be?

425
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,728
I do love you, by the way.

426
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,357
I mean, as much
as I'm capable of loving anyone.

427
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,485
Which is never enough. I'm sorry.

428
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,449
Ta-da!

429
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:33,500
Well, it is truly...

430
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:37,337
how should I put this? Wonderful.

431
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,631
So you'll give Elefante a good review?

432
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:44,761
No, I can't do that.
I waited over two hours to be served.

433
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,348
The ambience was terrible.
You two were screaming all night.

434
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,727
At one point, a waiter
ran through the restaurant on fire.

435
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,355
Unfortunately,
you will be receiving my lowest rating:

436
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,026
four hundred and twelve stars,
out of a possible a billion.

437
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,193
A billion stars?

438
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:04,323
Yes, that's the rubric I use on
SamanthaGoesToRestaurants.tumblr.com.

439
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,824
Oh, God, get out.

440
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,453
I assure you the animated GIFs

441
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:13,290
with which I describe this encounter
shall be scathing.

442
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,668
Mom! I just touched base
with Rooney, re: Winslow.

443
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,172
He's out, we're in.
The conference room is ours.

444
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,592
Perfect! This is the meeting
where we finally convince the big boys

445
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,635
to let us get babies addicted to vaping!

446
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,430
Yes! Corporation!

447
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,891
[all cheer]

448
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,811
- How about a drink?
- I could drink.

449
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,897
I don't think I can. I'm heading out.

450
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,733
I got pretty badly burnt earlier
and in a lot of pain.

451
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,235
I should probably go to the ER.
Have a great night.

452
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,987
[groans]

453
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,160
What's the second time we met?

454
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,705
- A taping of <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
- Which episode?

455
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,958
The one where Olivia put too much
detergent in the washing machine.

456
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,127
Oh, yeah.
Nancy Reagan was the guest star.

457
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,671
That woman
was the real actor in the family.

458
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,842
I had just started working for Marv.
I went backstage to introduce myself.

459
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,552
And then what happened?

460
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,472
You told me you were too tired
pretending to be nice all night,

461
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,557
and to leave you alone.

462
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,643
I'm a real jerk, huh?

463
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,020
Yeah, but you're honest,
straightforward,

464
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,314
not fake nice
and don't beat around the bush.

465
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,942
Your heart is tender,
so you protect it from people,

466
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:26,029
but sometimes you open up a wall
and it's incredible.

467
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,574
You're doing the best you can,
considering your asshole parents.

468
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,076
You have great taste in art,

469
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,079
and that pink spot
on your nose is just adorable.

470
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,081
How many nice things was that,
about ten?

471
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,583
- Just about.
- Okay, one more.

472
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,711
You let me help you tonight
because you knew I needed it.

473
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,631
You did it for me,
which was very sweet.

474
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,843
Thanks. You're a good friend to me.

475
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,554
- BoJack...
- Yeah?

476
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,888
Are we friends?

477
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,349
Yeah. I mean, I think we are.

478
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,393
Or I think we can be.

479
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,938
Okay, then as a friend, I'm asking you...

480
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,690
Please don't leave me.

481
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,275
- Princess Carolyn--
- Please.

482
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,069
I can turn this around,
I just need more time.

483
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,405
We're in a fragile period,
still finding our feet.

484
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,991
Just give me six months
and then you can go.

485
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,244
I promise,
I'll never ask anything from you again,

486
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,247
but please, give me six months.

487
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,499
Sorry, I left my coat here.

488
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,585
[whistles]

489
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,965
[waiter] I got it.

490
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,516
So? What do you think?

491
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,101
No.
