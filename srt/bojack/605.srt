00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,511
In my line of work,
I meet a lot of big names.

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:15,181
I'm talking the sexiest guys of the '90s:
Nick Nolte. Mickey Rourke...

3
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,891
Literally, here we are in the '90s,

4
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,185
and these are the guys
we think are sexy, right?

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,271
And my daughter couldn't care less.

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,315
But when I told her
I was meeting BoJack Horseman...

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,192
Do me a favor. Make her day.

8
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,485
[sighs]

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,779
Me? I didn't ask for this gig.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,615
Angela Diaz,
head of the network, calls me,

11
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,451
working schmuck, Danny Bananas,

12
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:39,080
and says, "Danny, Herb Kazzaz is leavin',
and I want you to run <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,624
So, here's me, thinking,
"What an opportunity

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,502
to write for the most finely-calibrated
ensemble cast on television!"

15
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,629
It's like a bowling alley
with you people.

16
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,340
Setting up pins and knocking them down.
I should be so lucky.

17
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,092
-Uh.
-I know it's no secret

18
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,552
that you and Herb had some friction,

19
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,430
and he left the show
under not-great circumstances.

20
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,390
Now I'm coming at this from a place of...

21
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,060
this is your house,
and I'm a guest, all right?

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,646
The magic of <i>Horsin' Around</i>
is not Herb Kazzaz or Danny Bananas.

23
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,941
I know why people buy the Big Mac.
I'm not here to change the recipe.

24
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,235
You're the special sauce, BoJack.

25
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,362
Me? I just wanna be the bun.

26
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,657
And not even the top or the bottom bun.
I'm fine being the middle bun.

27
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,785
-You already told me this story.
-I did?

28
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,080
Yeah. Danny. Sharona. The buns.
We've been over it.

29
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,749
-Well, did I tell you about Gina?
-Yes.

30
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,043
-And Sarah Lynn?
-Multiple times. Yes.

31
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,921
-What about the time I sneezed on Marisa?
-You've told me everything.

32
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,673
You told me about that dream
where you go to a dinner party.

33
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,509
I even went down
that strange detour with you

34
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,720
about the three-nippled woman in
the nudie magazine your uncle showed you.

35
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,098
-Who was she?
-I think we're done here.

36
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,392
-What do you mean, done?
-Well, you've been here six months.

37
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,894
It's time to go home.

{\an8}Great, when they discover my remains
scattered in the bramble of Griffith Park,

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,967
{\an8}my loved ones will take solace
knowing I died

46
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,803
{\an8}so they could shoot an episode
of <i>Birthday Dad.</i>

47
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,514
I'm sorry. It's a really good show!

48
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:09,063
{\an8}I know I couldn't always be there for you,
birthday-wise, but I'd like to be.

49
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,733
{\an8}I'd like to be your Birthday Dad.

50
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:15,195
{\an8}You really don't get it, do you?
This is the real world, okay?

51
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,656

I don't have time for birthdays.

{\an8}Everyone knows there's no such thing.
This is the real world.

No, what they're turned onto
is hating me...

{\an8}on account of I cheated on Pickles.

{\an8}Ever since the story went viral,

68

{\an8}the public has really mashed
the thumbs down on old Peanurino.

69
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,322
{\an8}-Especially young women.
-Oh, no!

70
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,659
{\an8}"Especially young women"
is one of our show's eight target demos.

71
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,868
We gotta juice your Q!

72
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,955
Right now, the only juice
I'm interested in is Pickles' juice

73
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:11,042
{\an8}and making things kosher between us,
which is a task I relish.

74
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,253
-So, you wanna have sex with me?
-Yes.

75
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,880
And your fiancÃ©
is gonna be in there watching, or...

76
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,715
Oh, no. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

77
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,551
This is not a fetish-based
cuckolding scenario.

78
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,972
He had sex with his ex, so to level
the playing field now, we have to boink,

79
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,891
so Mister and I can be even
and everything can go back to normal.

80
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,809
You understand?

81
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,519
Not really,
but I get to have sex with you?

82
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,561
-Yeah.
-Correct.

83
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,021
Then, cool. I'm in.

84
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,108
-But what about your reputation?
-I'm not too worried about it.

85
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,027
I feel like people
generally want to like me.

86
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,864
And if I just don't do anything,
eventually, the universe will realign

87
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,450
and the public will go back
to loving me again.

-Ugh.

00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,833
-Mm, thanks for making breakfast.
-Thanks for calling it breakfast.

90
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,460
Not everyone appreciates
the subtle art of the crispy oatmeal.

91
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,130
-Are you starting your memoir today?
-That was the plan.

92
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,882
But I got these dishes now.
That'll take all morning.

93
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,552
And once the morning's over,
basically the whole day is shot, you know?

94
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,803
Better to start clean tomorrow.

95
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,888
Look, I know it's hard
to start a new thing,

96
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,349
but the hardest part is starting.

97
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,267
You're right.

98
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,478
Also, I'm a freelance cameraman
who pays child support,

99
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,314
so I'd encourage you to get an advance.

-Remember when Doug left?

I didn't realize
we're the last of our original group.

-God, we had some good times, huh?
-I mean, no, mostly.

00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,561
-Yeah. But you're ready, right?
-Ready or not, here I go.

116
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,896
Yeah, you're ready.

117
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,023
Have you given any thought
to what we discussed yesterday?

118
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,234
About you transitioning to a version
of yourself that is no longer here?

119
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,362
I don't know.
Things are kinda working for me.

120
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,364
Staying out of trouble,
got the fancy room,

121
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,282
finally perfected
my egg-white omelet order.

122
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,285
The secret is egg yellows.
I might do another six weeks.

123
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,579
[chuckles] You've already re-upped
three times.

124
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,373
This place is for people in crisis.

125
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,709
In crisis of being too cool, maybe.
Right, Karmen?

126
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:21,255
-I-If I say yes, I can see my baby?
-Karmen, no.

127
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,883
You sold your baby to a den of leeches
to pay for crack.

128
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,261
-The leeches have your baby now.
-Oh, yeah.

129
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,596
Ah. Classic Karm.

130
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,348
It's natural to be hesitant.

131
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,017
When I first checked out of rehab,
I was terrified.

132
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:37,063
I knew a single drop of alcohol
would send me down a ruinous path.

133
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,899
-But I found my way.
-Found your way back to rehab.

134
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,610
-Ah, I'll miss our little comedy routines.
-"Our"?

135
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,487
A lot of people leave this place,

136
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,907
and I think, "They're not gonna make it."
Like Denise, for example.

137
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,369
But you?
You've done the work, and you're ready.

138
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,621
You're a special case, BoJack.

139
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,749
-I am?
-Of course you are.

140
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,419
Huh.

<i>did he do a number on you.</i>

142

He was actually very nice.
You know, I want things to be easy on set.

143
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,846
And I think Danny
represents a fresh start.

144
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,473
-Is that why you got Herb fired?
-Hey, I'm not the one who--

145
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,059
I can't do your hair
if you're gonna move your head so much.

146
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,853
There was nothing I could do about Herb.

147
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,147
If it wasn't for me,
they would've canceled the whole show.

148
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,314
And then where would you go?

149
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,692
Who's gonna hire
a hair-and-makeup lady with shaky hands?

150
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,446
-My hands only shake when I don't drink.
-Be sure to put that on your rÃ©sumÃ©.

151
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,324
You're just bitter because I'm the only
person who can drink as much as you do.

An ice cream truck
crashed into the root beer factory!

158
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,512
Oh, sounds like a delicious disaster.

159
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,265
-Five people are dead!
-Oh, no!

160
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,850
And there's worse to come,

161
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,437
unless somebody can slurp up
all that ice cream!

00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,983
Oh, I'd love to help slurp,
but I just started a new nannying job.

163
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,569
I don't care!

164
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,154
Hmm...

165
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,660
Wow, BoJack leaving rehab.

166
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,537
-Truly the end of an era.
-[crying]

167
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,749
Sobby Bobby.
Gonna miss your excessive crying.

168
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,666
Can't believe it.

169
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,252
Last time I'm gonna stop
at this vending machine.

170
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,797
What do you say, B-7?
One more hike down Funyun Canyon?

171
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,177
[inhales] Whew.

172
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,972
Oh, wow. Hello, the public.

173
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,683
Didn't think I'd have to address this
so quickly, but I am not ashamed.

174
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,437
-Yes, I, BoJack Horseman, went to rehab--
-Uh, keep it moving.

175
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,730
We wanna get a clean shot

176
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:47,902
for when Gen Z pop superstar/fashion
disrupter Joey Pogo shows up.

177
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,571
-Joey Pogo?
-Yeah, he's checking in today.

178
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,616
-We heard he's gettin' the fancy room.
-Fancy room?

179
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,787
He's gettin' the fancy room.

180
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,289
-It's time to go home.
-What?

181
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,582
Ready or not.

182
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,085
I got the fancy room.

183
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,588
He's gettin' the fancy room.

184
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,216
You're a special case, BoJack.

185
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,386
Stay cool, man. Have a good summer.

186
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,054
What does it all mean?

187
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,473
Sounds like they're kicking you out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

188
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,391
Huh?

189
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:23,646
Sounds like they're kicking you out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

190
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,564
Oh, my God.

191
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:28,109
I think they're kicking me out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

192
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,196
I just feel like if I knew
the source of my addiction,

193
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,699
everything else would just click together.

194
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,908
-Playtime's over.
-BoJack!

195
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,452
-What the hell? This is my time.
-Shut up, Brad.

196
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,996
The source of your addiction

197
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,291
is wanting to impress your old babysitter
who stole beer from your parents' fridge.

198
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,542
She's dead. You're free.

199
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,835
No, that's not...

200
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,752
Oh. Oh...

201
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,462
I thought you were checking out.

202
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:54,051
-Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you?
-Yes. I've been very clear on that matter.

203
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,845
Well, check this out.

204
00:09:55,928 --> 00:10:00,182
BoHo go bye... BoHo go bye-bye for...

205
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,392
What is he doing?

206
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,978
I think he's trying to get out a zinger.
We better let him finish.

207
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,980
You have to imagine that I just said it.

208
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,441
It's only funny
if it feels extemporaneous.

209
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,277
Don't waste your breath setting it up,
just say the thing.

210
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,362
-Why don't you start over?
-Check this out.

211
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,616
BoHo go bye-bye for JoJo Pogo?

212
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,868
That's a no-go, bro.

213
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,661
Worth it.

214
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,204
[car horns blaring]

215
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,082
I'm sorry. Please, go around.

216
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,003
I worked on it all night.
The thing that's gonna save your career.

217
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,838
Ha!

218
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,966
-What is it?
-It's a meme! For posting online!

219
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,552
{\an8}Teacher gave you too much homework?
"Sad Dog!"

220
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,597
Your favorite sports outfit
lost the match? "Sad Dog!"

221
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,433
People are gonna love it.
And that love will transfer to you.

222
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,603
But I'm not a sad dog.
I'm a happy dog. Everyone knows that.

223
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,229
-So, it needs some massaging.
-[phone rings]

224
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,314
Hold on, I gotta take this.

225
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,901
Conversation over? "Sad Dog!"
See how easy it is?

226
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,362
-[phone beeps]
-Pickles! How was your date with Carl?

227
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,571
I don't know, Mister.

228
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:00,284
The sex was good, like, really good,
but I didn't feel an emotional connection.

229
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,912
Don't beat yourself up about that.
You just met the guy.

230
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,581
But part of the betrayal
of you sleeping with Diane

231
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,833
is the fact that you share
an intimate history.

232
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,921
If we're really trying to even things out,
I don't think Carl counts.

233
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,675
Okay, well, then I guess you'll just have
to keep having sex with people

234
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,386
until you find someone with whom you have
an emotional connection.

235
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,805
[sighs] That might be a lot of guys,

236
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,849
but if that's what it's gonna take
to save our marriage,

237
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:28,020
I will keep riding the express train
to bone-town until that happens.

238
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,855
That's my girl.

239
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,608
-Oh! Thank you.
-[phone ringing]

240
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,651
-[beeps]
-Hello?

241
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,652
Hey, it's Diane.

242
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,738
Oh, yes, I thought I heard
retired dads in the distance,

243
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,532
praising the '95 Chicago Bulls.

244
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,867
Maybe you could give me some advice.
I'm writing a new book,

245
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,454
but I shouldn't even get started
until I sell it to a publisher, right?

246
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,873
-What is it?
-I'm still in the loose idea phase.

247
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,458
Half essay, half memoir.

248
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,543
The working title is

249
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:54,171
<i>One Last Thing, and Then I Swear to God</i>
<i>I'll Shut Up About This Forever:</i>

250
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,717
<i>A Definitive Retrospective</i>
<i>of the Choices We Make,</i>

251

<i>People We Hurt,</i>
<i>The Places We Go: Part One.</i>

252
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,598
Wait, how is it part one if it's
definitive? I'm getting another call.

253
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,516
-[phone beeps]
-Hello?

254
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,143
Hi, while you were blabbering on,

255
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,854
I had our lit assistant
take care of everything.

256
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,940
A navel-gazey book of observations.
Sounds fun.

257
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,734
-<i>No, I--</i>
-I sold it. You have six months.

258
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,110
Enjoy the process.

259
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,153
Oh.

260
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,531
[groans]

261
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,534
Wha...

262
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,580
What happened?
You're packing your things backwards.

263
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,665
What happened is you said I was special.

264
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,834
You gave a whole spiel
 just trying to get rid of me

265
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,878
to make room
for a high-profile new client.

266
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,046
I thought we'd made strides
on your jealousy issues.

267
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,673
And also, it's pronounced "shpeel."

268
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,634
I'm not jealous! And I've definitely
seen it written out as "spiel."

269
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,596
I think it's spelled "spiel,"
but it's pronounced "shpeel."

270
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,930
Not now, Joey Pogo.

271
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,726
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?
I was told I was in the fancy room?

272
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,353
We're moving some things around.
Uh, maybe you could come back tomorrow?

273
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,897
Oh, tomorrow is jammed.

274
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,107
I'm shootin' a video
for my new single, "Lace Up,"

275
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,985
which is spon-con
for my sneaker collab with Mister Pibb.

276
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,864
-Could we just do it now, real quick?
-You wanna do rehab real quick?

277
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,825
Life is precious. God is religious,
or merely the idea of human connection.

278
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,285
Don't do drugs. Say you're sorry.

279
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,497
Powerful stuff.
Feels like I just got a new lease on life.

280
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,123
Stay cool, bro. Don't ever change.

281
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,335
That's the problem. When you say it
in here, it all sounds easy.

282
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,796
But I know that out there,
it's hard and confusing.

283
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,173
-And it's just-- I-I don't...
-But you're not alone.

284
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,133
You have a wonderful support system.

285
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:26,889
Think of all your amazing friends
just waiting to love you as you love them.

286
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,516

287

[vibrates, beeps]

288
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,520
Todd's phone. What if Todd was one of us?

289
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,814
Um, okay. Is Todd there?

290
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,857
-Please hold for the next available Todd.
-[beeps]

291
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,775

You're probably wondering about Georgette,

00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,413
-the newest member of Team Chavez.
-Nope.

298
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,124
Since I've started
taking care of Ruthie full-time,

299
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,711
that hasn't given me a lot of time
for regular Todd business,

300
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,672
and stuff's been falling
through the cracks.

301
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,131
So, you hired an assistant?

302
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,884
Well, yes, but assistants
are like <i>Deadpool</i> movies.

303
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,137
I couldn't just stop at one,
even though I probably should have.

304
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,806
Now I have 12.

305
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,852
You hired 12 assistants? To assist <i>you?</i>

Yep, I've got Bella
trying out new goofy dances,

00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,580

I think I might be the only one on it.

-But another ace could join any day now.

And when that happens, two of a kind.

314
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,421
Well, I guess that makes about
as much sense as the rest of it.

315
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,632

of rehab soon...

BoJack, that's fantastic!

317
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:50,264

Okay, that's, uh, you know...
I think I'm good. Thank you.

325
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,705
He said I would be perfect for you
because you could be mean to me

326
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,707
and you wouldn't feel bad,
because you're paying me.

327
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,084
Okay, well, that's kind of thoughtful.

328
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,630
I'm a very good assistant, and I can be
very discreet, whatever you need.

329
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,633
Marc Cherry used to dress me
in the outfit Natalie Wood drowned in

330
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,176
and scream at me for hours on end.

331
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,929
It was very therapeutic for him,
and I didn't mind

332
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,598
because he wasn't screaming at me,
he was screaming at death.

333
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,600
Stars really are just like us, huh?

334
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,685
-Do you mind if I have a sip?
-Don't drink that!

335
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,647
Right, of course.
I must earn hydration. So sorry.

336
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,815
No, it's just... that's vodka.

337
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,069
You think it's a good idea
to keep a bottle of vodka in rehab?

338
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,780
Because it is if you think it is.

339
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,906
It's not for drinking.

340
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,952
I just, I... I don't know why I keep it.
As a reminder, I guess.

341
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,536
Of what?

342
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,538
[BoJack] <i>Sarah Lynn?</i>

343
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,832
<i>Sarah Lynn?</i>

344
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,042
<i>Sarah Lynn!</i>

345
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,835
-What?
-Are you almost done?

346
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,672
I need Sharona to work that magic
on her mane man.

347
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,132
Yeah, I'll get to you in a minute.
Cool your jets.

348
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,176
Why can't you do this
in Sarah Lynn's dressing room?

349
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,679
My stepdad's in there,
and he's being weird.

350
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,473
-Why is that my problem?
-We appreciate your hospitality.

351
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,642
Hey, BoJack,
what do you think of the new guy?

352
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,268
Danny? Yeah, he's okay. Right?

353
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,521
-I miss Herb.
-We all do, sweetie.

354
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,649
Herb. Danny. What difference does it make?
We got a job to do, right?

355
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,109
I'm just saying I miss him.

356
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,653
And I'm just saying
it's not my fault he got fired.

357
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,655
-I dunno why you're complaining to me.
-I'm sorry.

358
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,031
Nobody said it was your fault.

359
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,283
I actually think
Danny represents an opportunity.

360
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,201
For a new beginning.

361
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:38,414
You don't think it feels weird
to do the show without Herb?

362
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,041
If Herb really cared about the show,
maybe he shouldn't have...

363
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,126
What? Been gay?

364
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,128
No, that's not-- Obviously...

365
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,463
-I put my ass on the line for you people.
-Ugh. BoJack.

366
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,883
Do you know how lucky we are to have this?
Herb was gonna throw that all away.

367
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,885
I made the tough choice. What did you do?

368
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,930
-I... I don't know.
-BoJack, she's ten!

369
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,224
Yeah, which is basically an adult
in Hollywood years.

370
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,893
I'm trying to make this situation work.
Enjoy my dressing room.

371
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,939
[sighs] Hey, I know you feel shitty,
but don't take it out on a little girl.

372
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,608
[BoJack] I don't feel shitty,
I feel great!

373
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,323
Okay. You know why this is here, Casey?

374
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,702
It's because I think I'm special
and the rules don't apply to me.

375
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,912
And I keep thinking that
over and over again.

376
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,873
-Well, you are special.
-No, shut up.

377
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,916
-[gasps]
-That's the problem. I'm an asshole.

378
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,961
All your bosses are assholes.
And people like you indulge us.

379
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,505
And you soothe our egos,
and you let us abuse you.

380
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,675
-You're right, I'm terrible.
-No, God damn it. That's not my point.

381
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,260
Have some respect for yourself.

382
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,096
Okay, sorry.
I'm just happy to be a part of things.

383
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,432
Yeah, and that's how they get you.

384
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,436
[sighs] I'm sorry. It's not your fault.

385
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,564
Can you run downstairs
and grab me some Funyuns?

386
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,233
-Mm... No.
-What do you mean, no?

387
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,693
Huh.

388
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,739
I don't know. I'm not going to do that.

389
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,409
-Uh, what's happening?
-There's an "I" in "assistants."

390
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,579
And this time, the "I" is us.

391
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,207
I like your energy, but what?

00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,542

to tell you I didn't want onions.

00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,298
Where are you going?

396
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,884
-So, this lawyer's got attitude.
-[phone buzzes]

397
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,553
And that attitude? Autism.

398
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,348
I don't understand,
why is this person moving now?

399
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,808
Wait! What's goin' on?

400
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,144
The Hollywoo Assistants are unionizing.
This is a walk-out.

401
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,230
No! I've grown too dependent on you!

402
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,690
I can't perform
basic Todd functions anymore!

403
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,402
I'm like a toddler, but a Todd version.
A Toddler!

404
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,826
I know you got a job to do,
but is there any way...

-[phone beeps]
-...Joey Pogo could get through?

406
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,913
Just got out of rehab.
I'm trying to get home.

407
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,624
-Knock yourself out.
-All right!

408
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,628
Don't die on me, Ileanna.
Not on your birthday, of all days!

409
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,090
Year after year,
the only thing I wished for was a dad.

410
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,259
[sobs] And now you're here,
and it's like...

412
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,806
But if you just told me your wish,
that means it won't come true!

You really don't get it, do you?
It already has. [gasps]

I love you, Birthday Eric.

-Uh...
-I saw the whole thing.

426
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,964
Mr. Peanutbutter said, "I'm a sad dog,"
and jumped right in front of the car.

427
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,134
I think he's a really sad dog, you guys.
You know, like the meme.

-[all gasping]
-Oh, my God, I had no idea.

429
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,932
Mr. Peanutbutter, life is precious.
That's something you hear a lot in rehab.

430
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,810
Hey, why'd you try to kill yourself,
you stupid idiot?

431
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,478
-Um...
-I'm no psychiatrist,

432
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,273
but it's probably because
he's such a sad dog!

433
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,858
[gasps] Mr. Peanutbutter,

434
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,277
we didn't realize
you have a mental illness.

435
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,654
Thank you for getting the word out
about depression.

436
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:02,409
You are truly a hero for destigmatizing
this all-too-common affliction.

437
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,952
Yes, a hero!

438
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,079
And to see more of this hero in action,

439
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,291
tune in to <i>Birthday Dad</i> this spring
on MBN!

Uh-huh.

But what pisses me off

is when you take a bed that someone else
could be using to get better.

00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,960
But like, name one other handsome Brad.

487
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,420
-Bradley Cooper.
-Damn it!

488
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,507
Doctor Champ, I am so sorry.
That was vodka you drank, not water.

489
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,551
Uh, duh!

490
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:28,013
-Jesus.
<i>-âª I'm drunk! âª</i>

491
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,807
Shh! Shut up.
If anyone hears you, there's gonna be...

492
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,142
I forgot how fun this is.

493
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,186
-Just settle down, okay?
-Ah!

494
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,355
You're gonna spend the night here
and sober up.

495
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,566
Oh, so it's easy to be sober
all of sudden.

496
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,985
[slurring] Look who thinks
it's easy sober, hmm?

497
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,487
Shh! Doctor Champ!

498
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,407
It's so easy. Everything, very easy.

499
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,160

-[grunting]
-Hey, Horse.

502
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,961
Bad news about the Manzanita lawsuit.
You think he'll settle?

503
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,671
Settle? Manzanita?

504
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,258
I'd say that's about as likely
as my daughter Sabrina skipping school

505
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,886
and sneaking into the office with me
in my work luggage!

506
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,931
[audience laughter]

507
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:11,890
-Uh...
-Uh...

508
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,308
-[director] Cut!
-[bells rings]

509
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,436
Listen, you're doing great.
Slight change of plans, though.

510
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,606
Sarah Lynn had to go home early.
So, we need to change the episode

511
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,692
to being about you
<i>not </i>bringing Sabrina to the office.

512
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,819
Is she okay?

513
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,280
Uh, only reason I'm telling you this
is you're my main guy here,

514
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,157
and I know you want
what's best for everyone.

515
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,702
-Of course.
-Sarah Lynn got her hands on some alcohol.

516
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,704
-Oh, my God.
-Her mother is apoplectic.

517
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:35,789
She wants to sue.

518
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:39,709
I think it's just big talk,
but someone needs to be held accountable.

519
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,294
And as the guys in charge here,

520
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:45,006
we're responsible
for figuring out who that's gonna be.

521
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,175
-What are you...
-I need you to be straight with me.

522
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,053
-That wasn't your alcohol, right?
-Oh, I don't...

523
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,346
It wasn't, right?

524
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,932
Because if it was,
we're all in real trouble.

525
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,017
-You get what I'm saying.
-Y-Yeah.

526
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,229
So, you don't know
where she got the alcohol from?

527
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,647
Yeah. I have no idea.

528
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,067
Okay. But someone's gotta answer for this.

529
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,902
Well, don't look at me.

530
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,320
Hmm...

531
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:11,575
-What?
-Nothing. Just a little uneven, is all.

532
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,547
Oh. I'm screwed. I'm so screwed.

533
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,466
-It's gonna be okay.
-No!

534
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,760
I'm drunk. Not okay.
You can't let anyone know about this.

535
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,888
-Shush!
-Yeah. Shh.

536
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:37,017
You gotta stay with me until I sober up.
I can't be alone here like this.

537
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,643
It's okay, I'm here.

538
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:43,023
Yeah, be here.
You need to stay here, BoJack.

539
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,109
Please. Stay.
