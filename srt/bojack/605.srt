00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,511
In my line of work,
I meet a lot of big names.

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:15,181
I'm talking the sexiest guys of the '90s:
Nick Nolte. Mickey Rourke...

3
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,891
Literally, here we are in the '90s,

4
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,185
and these are the guys
we think are sexy, right?

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,271
And my daughter couldn't care less.

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,315
But when I told her
I was meeting BoJack Horseman...

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,192
Do me a favor. Make her day.

8
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,485
[sighs]

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,779
Me? I didn't ask for this gig.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,615
Angela Diaz,
head of the network, calls me,

11
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,451
working schmuck, Danny Bananas,

12
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:39,080
and says, "Danny, Herb Kazzaz is leavin',
and I want you to run <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,624
So, here's me, thinking,
"What an opportunity

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,502
to write for the most finely-calibrated
ensemble cast on television!"

15
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,629
It's like a bowling alley
with you people.

16
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,340
Setting up pins and knocking them down.
I should be so lucky.

17
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,092
-Uh.
-I know it's no secret

18
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,552
that you and Herb had some friction,

19
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,430
and he left the show
under not-great circumstances.

20
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,390
Now I'm coming at this from a place of...

21
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,060
this is your house,
and I'm a guest, all right?

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,646
The magic of <i>Horsin' Around</i>
is not Herb Kazzaz or Danny Bananas.

23
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,941
I know why people buy the Big Mac.
I'm not here to change the recipe.

24
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,235
You're the special sauce, BoJack.

25
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,362
Me? I just wanna be the bun.

26
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,657
And not even the top or the bottom bun.
I'm fine being the middle bun.

27
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,785
-You already told me this story.
-I did?

28
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,080
Yeah. Danny. Sharona. The buns.
We've been over it.

29
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,749
-Well, did I tell you about Gina?
-Yes.

30
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,043
-And Sarah Lynn?
-Multiple times. Yes.

31
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,921
-What about the time I sneezed on Marisa?
-You've told me everything.

32
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,673
You told me about that dream
where you go to a dinner party.

33
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,509
I even went down
that strange detour with you

34
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,720
about the three-nippled woman in
the nudie magazine your uncle showed you.

35
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,098
-Who was she?
-I think we're done here.

36
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,392
-What do you mean, done?
-Well, you've been here six months.

37
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,894
It's time to go home.

{\an8}Great, when they discover my remains
scattered in the bramble of Griffith Park,

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,967
{\an8}my loved ones will take solace
knowing I died

46
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,803
{\an8}so they could shoot an episode
of <i>Birthday Dad.</i>

47
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,514
I'm sorry. It's a really good show!

48
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:09,063
{\an8}I know I couldn't always be there for you,
birthday-wise, but I'd like to be.

49
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,733
{\an8}I'd like to be your Birthday Dad.

50
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:15,195
{\an8}You really don't get it, do you?
This is the real world, okay?

51
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,656
{\an8}And I'm a career gal.
I don't have time for birthdays.

{\an8}But what about the birthday spirit?

{\an8}Everyone knows there's no such thing.
This is the real world.

{\an8}Am I crazy, or has the crew turned on you?

No, what they're turned onto
is hating me...

{\an8}on account of I cheated on Pickles.

{\an8}Ever since the story went viral,

68
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:57,028
{\an8}the public has really mashed
the thumbs down on old Peanurino.

69
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,322
{\an8}-Especially young women.
-Oh, no!

70
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,659
{\an8}"Especially young women"
is one of our show's eight target demos.

71
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,868
We gotta juice your Q!

72
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,955
Right now, the only juice
I'm interested in is Pickles' juice

73
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:11,042
{\an8}and making things kosher between us,
which is a task I relish.

74
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,253
-So, you wanna have sex with me?
-Yes.

75
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,880
And your fiancé
is gonna be in there watching, or...

76
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,715
Oh, no. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

77
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,551
This is not a fetish-based
cuckolding scenario.

78
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,972
He had sex with his ex, so to level
the playing field now, we have to boink,

79
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,891
so Mister and I can be even
and everything can go back to normal.

80
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,809
You understand?

81
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,519
Not really,
but I get to have sex with you?

82
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,561
-Yeah.
-Correct.

83
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,021
Then, cool. I'm in.

84
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,108
-But what about your reputation?
-I'm not too worried about it.

85
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,027
I feel like people
generally want to like me.

86
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,864
And if I just don't do anything,
eventually, the universe will realign

87
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,450
and the public will go back
to loving me again.

00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,411
-[grunts]
-Ugh.

89
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,833
-Mm, thanks for making breakfast.
-Thanks for calling it breakfast.

90
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,460
Not everyone appreciates
the subtle art of the crispy oatmeal.

91
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,130
-Are you starting your memoir today?
-That was the plan.

92
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,882
But I got these dishes now.
That'll take all morning.

93
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,552
And once the morning's over,
basically the whole day is shot, you know?

94
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,803
Better to start clean tomorrow.

95
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,888
Look, I know it's hard
to start a new thing,

96
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,349
but the hardest part is starting.

97
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,267
You're right.

98
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,478
Also, I'm a freelance cameraman
who pays child support,

99
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,314
so I'd encourage you to get an advance.

We've all been through so much together,
and it's never easy to say goodbye.

-Remember when Doug left?
-[all] Hmm?

00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,720
I didn't realize
we're the last of our original group.

00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,557
-God, we had some good times, huh?
-I mean, no, mostly.

115
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,561
-Yeah. But you're ready, right?
-Ready or not, here I go.

116
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,896
Yeah, you're ready.

117
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,023
Have you given any thought
to what we discussed yesterday?

118
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,234
About you transitioning to a version
of yourself that is no longer here?

119
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,362
I don't know.
Things are kinda working for me.

120
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,364
Staying out of trouble,
got the fancy room,

121
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,282
finally perfected
my egg-white omelet order.

122
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,285
The secret is egg yellows.
I might do another six weeks.

123
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,579
[chuckles] You've already re-upped
three times.

124
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,373
This place is for people in crisis.

125
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,709
In crisis of being too cool, maybe.
Right, Karmen?

126
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:21,255
-I-If I say yes, I can see my baby?
-Karmen, no.

127
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,883
You sold your baby to a den of leeches
to pay for crack.

128
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,261
-The leeches have your baby now.
-Oh, yeah.

129
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,596
Ah. Classic Karm.

130
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,348
It's natural to be hesitant.

131
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,017
When I first checked out of rehab,
I was terrified.

132
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:37,063
I knew a single drop of alcohol
would send me down a ruinous path.

133
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,899
-But I found my way.
-Found your way back to rehab.

134
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,610
-Ah, I'll miss our little comedy routines.
-"Our"?

135
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,487
A lot of people leave this place,

136
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,907
and I think, "They're not gonna make it."
Like Denise, for example.

137
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,369
But you?
You've done the work, and you're ready.

138
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,621
You're a special case, BoJack.

139
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,749
-I am?
-Of course you are.

140
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,419
Huh.

141
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,713

<i>did he do a number on you.</i>

142
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,802
He was actually very nice.
You know, I want things to be easy on set.

143
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,846
And I think Danny
represents a fresh start.

144
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,473
-Is that why you got Herb fired?
-Hey, I'm not the one who--

145
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,059
I can't do your hair
if you're gonna move your head so much.

146
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,853
There was nothing I could do about Herb.

147
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,147
If it wasn't for me,
they would've canceled the whole show.

148
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,314
And then where would you go?

149
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,692
Who's gonna hire
a hair-and-makeup lady with shaky hands?

150
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,446
-My hands only shake when I don't drink.
-Be sure to put that on your résumé.

151
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,324
You're just bitter because I'm the only
person who can drink as much as you do.

An ice cream truck
crashed into the root beer factory!

158
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,512
Oh, sounds like a delicious disaster.

159
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,265
-Five people are dead!
-Oh, no!

160
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,850
And there's worse to come,

161
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,437
unless somebody can slurp up
all that ice cream!

Didn't think I'd have to address this
so quickly, but I am not ashamed.

-Uh, keep it moving.

176
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:47,902

disrupter Joey Pogo shows up.

177
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,571
-Joey Pogo?
-Yeah, he's checking in today.

178

-We heard he's gettin' the fancy room.
-Fancy room?

179

He's gettin' the fancy room.

-It's time to go home.
-What?

181

Ready or not.

182
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,085

What does it all mean?

187
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,473
Sounds like they're kicking you out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

188
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,391
Huh?

189
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:23,646
Sounds like they're kicking you out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

190

Oh, my God.

191
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:28,109
I think they're kicking me out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

192
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,196
I just feel like if I knew
the source of my addiction,

193
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,699
everything else would just click together.

-Playtime's over.
-BoJack!

-What the hell? This is my time.
-Shut up, Brad.

196
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,996
The source of your addiction

197
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,291
is wanting to impress your old babysitter
who stole beer from your parents' fridge.

198
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,542
She's dead. You're free.

I think he's trying to get out a zinger.
We better let him finish.

You have to imagine that I just said it.

It's only funny
if it feels extemporaneous.

Don't waste your breath setting it up,

People are gonna love it.
And that love will transfer to you.

But I'm not a sad dog.
I'm a happy dog. Everyone knows that.

227
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,571
I don't know, Mister.

228
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:00,284
The sex was good, like, really good,
but I didn't feel an emotional connection.

229
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,912
Don't beat yourself up about that.
You just met the guy.

230
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,581
But part of the betrayal
of you sleeping with Diane

231
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,833
is the fact that you share
an intimate history.

232
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,921
If we're really trying to even things out,
I don't think Carl counts.

233
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,675
Okay, well, then I guess you'll just have
to keep having sex with people

234
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,386
until you find someone with whom you have
an emotional connection.

235

[sighs] That might be a lot of guys,

236

to save our marriage,

244
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,867
Maybe you could give me some advice.
I'm writing a new book,

245
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,454
but I shouldn't even get started
until I sell it to a publisher, right?

take care of everything.

What happened?
You're packing your things backwards.

263
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,665
What happened is you said I was special.

264
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,834
You gave a whole spiel
 just trying to get rid of me

265
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,878
to make room
for a high-profile new client.

266
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,046
I thought we'd made strides
on your jealousy issues.

267
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,673
And also, it's pronounced "shpeel."

268
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,634
I'm not jealous! And I've definitely
seen it written out as "spiel."

I think it's spelled "spiel,"
but it's pronounced "shpeel."

Not now, Joey Pogo.

Uh, maybe you could come back tomorrow?

00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,705
He said I would be perfect for you
because you could be mean to me

326
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,707
and you wouldn't feel bad,
because you're paying me.

327
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,084
Okay, well, that's kind of thoughtful.

328
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,630
I'm a very good assistant, and I can be
very discreet, whatever you need.

329
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,633
Marc Cherry used to dress me
in the outfit Natalie Wood drowned in

330
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,176
and scream at me for hours on end.

331
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,929
It was very therapeutic for him,
and I didn't mind

332
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,598
because he wasn't screaming at me,
he was screaming at death.

333
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,600
Stars really are just like us, huh?

334
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,685
-Do you mind if I have a sip?
-Don't drink that!

335
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,647
Right, of course.
I must earn hydration. So sorry.

336
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,815
No, it's just... that's vodka.

337
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,069
You think it's a good idea
to keep a bottle of vodka in rehab?

338
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,780
Because it is if you think it is.

339
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,906
It's not for drinking.

340
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,952
I just, I... I don't know why I keep it.
As a reminder, I guess.

341
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,536

-What?
-Are you almost done?

346

on her mane man.

Yeah, I'll get to you in a minute.
Cool your jets.

348
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,176
Why can't you do this
in Sarah Lynn's dressing room?

349
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,679
My stepdad's in there,
and he's being weird.

350
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,473
-Why is that my problem?
-We appreciate your hospitality.

351
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,642
Hey, BoJack,
what do you think of the new guy?

352
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,268
Danny? Yeah, he's okay. Right?

353
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,521
-I miss Herb.
-We all do, sweetie.

354
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,649
Herb. Danny. What difference does it make?
We got a job to do, right?

355
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,109
I'm just saying I miss him.

356
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,653
And I'm just saying
it's not my fault he got fired.

357
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,655
-I dunno why you're complaining to me.
-I'm sorry.

358
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,031
Nobody said it was your fault.

359
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,283
I actually think
Danny represents an opportunity.

360
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,201
For a new beginning.

361
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:38,414
You don't think it feels weird
to do the show without Herb?

362
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,041
If Herb really cared about the show,
maybe he shouldn't have...

363
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,126
What? Been gay?

364
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,128
No, that's not-- Obviously...

365
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,463
-I put my ass on the line for you people.
-Ugh. BoJack.

366
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,883
Do you know how lucky we are to have this?
Herb was gonna throw that all away.

367
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,885
I made the tough choice. What did you do?

368
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,930
-I... I don't know.
-BoJack, she's ten!

369
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,224
Yeah, which is basically an adult
in Hollywood years.

370
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,893
I'm trying to make this situation work.
Enjoy my dressing room.

371
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,939
[sighs] Hey, I know you feel shitty,
but don't take it out on a little girl.

372
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,608
[BoJack] I don't feel shitty,
I feel great!

373
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,323
Okay. You know why this is here, Casey?

374
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,702
It's because I think I'm special
and the rules don't apply to me.

375
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,912
And I keep thinking that
over and over again.

376
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,873
-Well, you are special.
-No, shut up.

-That's the problem. I'm an asshole.

All your bosses are assholes.
And people like you indulge us.

379
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,505
And you soothe our egos,
and you let us abuse you.

380
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,675
-You're right, I'm terrible.
-No, God damn it. That's not my point.

381
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,260
Have some respect for yourself.

382
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,096
Okay, sorry.
I'm just happy to be a part of things.

383
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,432
Yeah, and that's how they get you.

384
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,436
[sighs] I'm sorry. It's not your fault.

385
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,564
Can you run downstairs
and grab me some Funyuns?

386
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,233
-Mm... No.
-What do you mean, no?

387
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,693
Huh.

388
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,739
I don't know. I'm not going to do that.

389
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,409
-Uh, what's happening?
-There's an "I" in "assistants."

00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,420
-Bradley Cooper.
-Damn it!

488
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,507
Doctor Champ, I am so sorry.
That was vodka you drank, not water.

489
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,551
Uh, duh!

490
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:28,013
-Jesus.

491
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,807
Shh! Shut up.
If anyone hears you, there's gonna be...

492
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,142
I forgot how fun this is.

493
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,186
-Just settle down, okay?
-Ah!

494
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,355
You're gonna spend the night here
and sober up.

495
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,566
Oh, so it's easy to be sober
all of sudden.

496
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,985
[slurring] Look who thinks
it's easy sober, hmm?

497
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,487
Shh! Doctor Champ!

498
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,407
It's so easy. Everything, very easy.

502
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,961
Bad news about the Manzanita lawsuit.
You think he'll settle?

503
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,671
Settle? Manzanita?

504
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,258
I'd say that's about as likely
as my daughter Sabrina skipping school

505
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,886
and sneaking into the office with me
in my work luggage!

Listen, you're doing great.
Slight change of plans, though.

510
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,606
Sarah Lynn had to go home early.
So, we need to change the episode

511
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,692
to being about you
<i>not </i>bringing Sabrina to the office.

512
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,819
Is she okay?

513
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,280
Uh, only reason I'm telling you this
is you're my main guy here,

514
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,157
and I know you want
what's best for everyone.

515
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,702
-Of course.
-Sarah Lynn got her hands on some alcohol.

516
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,704
-Oh, my God.
-Her mother is apoplectic.

517
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:35,789
She wants to sue.

518
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:39,709
I think it's just big talk,
but someone needs to be held accountable.

519
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,294
And as the guys in charge here,

520
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:45,006
we're responsible
for figuring out who that's gonna be.

521
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,175
-What are you...
-I need you to be straight with me.

522
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,053
-That wasn't your alcohol, right?
-Oh, I don't...

523
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,346
It wasn't, right?

524
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,932
Because if it was,
we're all in real trouble.

525
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,017
-You get what I'm saying.
-Y-Yeah.

526
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,229
So, you don't know
where she got the alcohol from?

527
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,647
Yeah. I have no idea.

528
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,067
Okay. But someone's gotta answer for this.

529
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,902
Well, don't look at me.

530
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,320
Hmm...

531
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:11,575
-What?
-Nothing. Just a little uneven, is all.

532
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,547
Oh. I'm screwed. I'm so screwed.

533
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,466
-It's gonna be okay.
-No!

534
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,760
I'm drunk. Not okay.
You can't let anyone know about this.

535
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,888
-Shush!
-Yeah. Shh.

536
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:37,017
You gotta stay with me until I sober up.
I can't be alone here like this.

537
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,643
It's okay, I'm here.

538
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:43,023
Yeah, be here.
You need to stay here, BoJack.

539
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,109
