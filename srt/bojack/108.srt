00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,977
Anyway, I'm off to Malibu
to see Herb Kazzaz.

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,312
He has cancer, which,
as you know, is a whole thing.

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,523
Plus, he hates me,
so I could really use

10
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,232
some good news
at the end of the day.

11
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,901
Oh, my God.
You're going to see Herb?

12
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,945
You must be really--
Nope.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,447
- Don't care. Not interested.
- [phone beeps]

14
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,449
Okay, Good talk.

15
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:34,409
Hey.

16
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,203
- Ready for this?
- Listen.

17
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,287
I want to make sure
I don't spend

18
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,080
any time alone with Herb.

19
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,791
I'm bringing you
along as my buffer.

20
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,041
And your memoirist.

21
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,126
I should meet
your old best friend

22
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,503
before he dies of cancer.

23
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,587
Fine, I guess.

24
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,839
Just don't abandon me.

25
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,131
No bathroom breaks.

26
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,633
And don't slip out
of the room

27
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:52,845
to text your fiancé
a bunch of winky smileys

28
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,430
with hearts next to them--
Gross.

29
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,391
Congratulations on
the whole being engaged thing,

30
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,684
- by the way.
- Thanks.

31
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,101
It's just starting

32
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,812

00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,605
Thank God I don't
have to die alone.

34
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,815
- No offense.
- None taken.

35
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,441
Till you said, "No offense."

36
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,652
So what's the deal with you
and this guy?

37
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,070
You never talk about him.

38
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,490
Well, I kind of, maybe
stabbed him in the back.

39
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,117
Yeah, it's a bit of a story.

40
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:21,081
A story of power, betrayal,
and ambitious hairstyles.

41
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,666
The year?
198--

42
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,002
- Movie's over.
- Watch the next one.

43
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:28,756
Aw, I'm tired
of watching movies.

44
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,674
- Do you want to play a game?
- Sure.

45
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,427
I spy with my little eye
someone who needs

46
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,762
to shut the hell up.

47
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,847
- Is it me?
- It's always you.

48
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,348
- Now, where was I?
- You were about to tell

49
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,934
a story about you being
a shitty friend,

50
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,227
but then, we got interrupted
by you yelling at Todd.

51

Oh, yeah.
Shut up, Todd.

Herb's about to hit

and I'm just gonna be
a small-fry

You're gonna be
a big success.

all the time.

167

- He thinks the world of you.
- He does?

168
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,545
Yeah, I'm not worried about
if you'll become a star.

169
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,340
I'm more worried about how
you'll change when it happens.

170
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,799
Like, you think I'll get fat?

171
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,968
No, that's not
what I'm talking about.

No, BoJack,
the show's about a horse,

00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,029
But you know me, right?

343
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,656
You know that I'm a good guy.

344
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,408
They're gunning for me
at the network,

345
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,951
and if I get kicked off this,
I won't recover.

346
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,786
I need to know that
you've got my back.

347
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,831
If you threaten to walk,
they'll listen to you.

348
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,084
Herb, you picked
the worst possible time to--

349
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,295
Hey, you know I wouldn't
ask if I didn't need it.

350
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,297
Come on, BoJack.

351
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,466
How'd we get
so far apart, huh?

352
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,635
[sighs]

353
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,597
You know what?
You can count on me, Herb.

354
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,806
I mean, I wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for you.

355
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,268
I knew it!
I knew you'd come through.

356
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,103
And when this is all over,
we're going

357
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,770
to drive back up
to Griffith Park.

358
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,023
I still owe you
that high five, right?

359
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,650
Hey, this is
a dumb question,

360
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,611
but do you guys ever,
like, all link up together

361
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,654
and do, like, a party train
or a fun circle?

362
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,155
'Cause I feel like
I'd be doing that all the--

363
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,490
Never mind.
Stupid question.

364
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,117
Feel stupid for asking that.

365
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,786
- [crowd shouting]
- [barking]

366
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,247
Go right ahead.

367
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,374
And then it goes,
"I like healthy gums

368
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,833
in a major way."

369
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,210
See, that's
what I'm talking about.

370
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,794
That's great.

371
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,756
We just gotta make sure
that we work in the phrase

372
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,383
"toothbrush rap" early,
so they know I'm rapping.

373
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,639
BoJack,
can we chat for a second?

374
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,350
Ugh. Here we go.
It's the big one.

375
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,810
I'm not gonna waste
your time with small talk

376
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,980
because you work for me,
and your time is my time.

377
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,690
We're letting Herb go.

378
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,358
- You can't do that.
- "I can't do that."

379
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,277
I'm not asking you.
It's nothing personal.

380
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,362
I like Herb.
I think he's a good guy.

381
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,989
But this is a business,
and every day

382
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,532
we don't fire him,
we're flushing money

383
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,367
- down the crapper.
- Well, if he goes, I go.

384
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,661
"Well, if he goes, you go."
I wouldn't do that.

385
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,370
BoJack, I think you're a star,

386
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,499
and sometimes being a star
means making tough choices.

387
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,751
You can storm out,
make a big show out of

388
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,127
what a "good" friend
you are,

389
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,045
or you could be
the guy who does his job.

390
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,506
- Angela--
- I'll tell you when

391
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,299
it's your turn
to talk again.

392
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,426
Look, you're a star,
but this is really just

393
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,720
the beginning of
the BoJack Horseman story.

394
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,139
You can choose
whatever path you want,

395
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,683
but I'll tell you right now.

396
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,351
You don't win awards
and you don't

397
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,269
get to be on the covers
of magazines

398
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,104
and you don't get
to play the lead role

399
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,940
in the <i>Secretariat </i>movie
by being a good friend.

400
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,652
What's that old expression
about how the show must go on?

401
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,488
Oh, right.
It's "Don't be an idiot."

402
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,783
So what do you think, BoJack?
That's a courtesy question.

403
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,410
I already know what you think
because I have conversations

404
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,078
like this one five times a day.

405
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,039
I know who you are,
and I know

406
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,123
you've already
made your decision.

407
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,792
But if you want
to surprise me,

408
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,251
now's the time to do it.

409
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,086
That's what I thought.

410
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,047
You're doing the right thing.
I know it's hard.

411
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,216
But if Herb's really your
friend, he'll understand.

412
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,259
Now, you've got
a show to put on,

413
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,720
so I'll let you get ready.

414
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,096
This was a good conversation.
Productive.

415
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,892
If you're lucky,
I'll never talk to you again.

416
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,561
[cup thuds]

417
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,188
[sighs]

418
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,232
[announcer] You folks ready for a show?

419
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,692
[audience cheering]

420
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,402
'Cause I think
a certain someone

421
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,571
might show up any second.

422
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,658
[applause]

423
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,619
[sighs]

424
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,037
- [cheers and applause]
- Wait a minute.

425
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,706
This isn't the bar.

426
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,708
I gotta fire my assistant.

427
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,292
[laughter]

428
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,297
So what ended up happening
with <i>Secretariat?</i>

429
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,924
Went into turnaround.

430
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,593
I don't totally know
what "turnaround" means,

431
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,554
- but they never made the movie.
- Whoa.

432
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,766
This house is way bigger
than yours.

433
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,769
Herb's done really well
for a guy you dicked over.

434
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,395
- Oh, no. Ah.
- That's enough out of you.

435
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,979
Stay out here
and turn this car around

436
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,857
in case we need to leave
in a hurry.

437
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,817
Hooray. A task.

438
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,694
[doorbell rings]

439
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,862
[sighs]

440
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,405
[coughs]

441
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,449
BoJack!
Well.

442
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,158
Jesus, you look shitty.

443
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,787
Have you been eating your guilt
this whole time?

444
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,997
[all laugh]

445
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,250
Yeah, you don't look
so hot yourself, Herb.

446
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,545
I have cancer.

447
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,881
And hello.
Who's this stunning creature?

448
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,424
And what string
of bad decisions

449
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,967
has placed you
in BoJack's orbit?

450
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,510
- Uh--
- This is Diane.

451
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,011
She's writing a book
about me.

452
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,722
Pleasure to meet you.

453
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,933
Is your book called,
<i>Portrait of an Asshole?</i>

454
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,684
[laughs]
I kid.

455
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,603
It's funny,
because he ruined my life.

456
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,020
I joke.
It's what I do.

457
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,397
Please, come in.

458
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,482
You're letting out
all the cancer.

459
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,858
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

460
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,485
[forced laugh]

461
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,903
Ha ha...

462
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,488
Almost.
Ah...

463
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,782
Almost there.

464
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,909
Come on... ah.

465
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,202
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.
- [bear growls]

466
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,038
BoJack, how are
your utensils?

467
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,749
- Uh, they're fine.
- Are you sure?

468
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,542
Because if that knife
ain't sharp enough,

469
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,420
I got another that you left
in my back 20 years ago.

470
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,922
- [laughs]
- Could have seen that coming.

471
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,298
Who asks about utensils?

472
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,508
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

473
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,301
Nope. No, you are not.

474
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,928
Uh.

475
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,930
Oh. Ow. Almost.

476
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,015
[exciting music]

477
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,017
- Drive, drive, drive!
- Oh. Oh, no.

478
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,853
I can't turn
the car around.

479
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,062
I've been trying to do this
three-point turn forever.

480
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,440
I mean, it's more
like a 300-point turn.

481
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,025
- Am I right, huh?
- Hee hee hee hee!

482
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,527
Hey, we've got two sacks

483
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,320
of Kardashian swag
and the fuzz on our heels.

484
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,948
You think this is Driver's Ed,
you hat-wearing pussy?

485
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,451
Drive the goddamn car!

486
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,620
[coughs]

487
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,331
Hey, Herb,

488
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,958
is that your Vitamix?

489
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,250
BoJack has one, too.

490
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,711
I wonder if you guys have

491
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:28,006
strong opinions about it
one way or the other.

492
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,799
Well, the stupid thing
was like 600 bucks.

493
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,885
I have used mine
a grand total of zero times.

494
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,178
I got it a month before
I was diagnosed with cancer.

495
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,972
I don't give a shit
about being healthy anymore.

496
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,724
I don't even have cancer,
and I don't use it.

497
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,141
- So who's it for?
- Exactly.

498
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,019
What is so great
about liquids?

499
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,146
Every article I read now is
"juice this" and "juice that."

500
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,440
You know why?
Juice controls the media.

501
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,861
- Hey-ooh.
- [both laugh]

502
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,738
Can't this thing
go any faster?

503
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,114
Uh, I'm going
as fast as I can.

504
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,868
[tires squealing]

505
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,452
Do you want me to get out?
Try to guide you?

506
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,871
No, I think
I'm almost there.

507
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,247
You're doing a great job.

508
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,457
Kenzie, stop talking to him.

509
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,543
Why? He's being nice.

510
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,753
Remember
the number one rule

511
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,379
of the Celebrity Stealing Club--

512
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,297
- "No falling in love."
- Ugh.

513

That's your rule
for every club.

514

It's a good rule.

Whoa. Whoa, guys.

516

I'm sensing a lot
of hostility here.

517
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,476
Maybe we should take
our masks off and actually talk.

518

You want me to take
my mask off? Fine.

519

I took my mask off.

520

Did you?

521
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,986

you're still wearing a mask.

522

Oh, yeah. Many times.

I spent the last 20 years

sorry for myself?

but I also started...

in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,503
Oh, wow.

531
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,089

the Teen Choice Awards.

533
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,300
Yeah, yeah.
We kept in touch.

534
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,927
You should actually
give her a call.

535
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,762
I'm sure she'd
love to hear from you.

536

for someone so old.

557
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,181

this one afternoon.

00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,669
I should have brought
a bottle of wine.

That's what adults do.
BoJack, damn it.

572
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,506
Is that what's bothering you,

573
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,550
- that you didn't bring wine?
- You're right.

574
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,968
I just would have drunk it
on the way here.

This isn't about wine,
BoJack.

If you have something
you need to say to someone,

you should do it
while you have the chance

578

it'll be too late.

talking about something else?

This could be

No. I'm not gonna
give you closure.

for the rest of your life.

You have to know that
it's never,

ever going to be okay.

603
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,701

- I'm dying.

I'm not gonna feel better,

and I'm not gonna be your prop
so you can feel better.

You have to believe me.

- Yeah?

would turn on me.

you got fired.

I did fine.
I had a good life.

619
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,691
But what I needed then
was a friend,

620
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,860
and you abandoned me.

for that.
