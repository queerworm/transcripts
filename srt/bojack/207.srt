00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,348
Thank you, Billy Crystal,
for that impression of a black person.

3
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,726
{\an8}-I'm Scott Wolf.
-And I'm Matthew Fox.

4
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,854
{\an8}We may be a group of five on TV,

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,606
{\an8}but any of these next nominees
would be welcome

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,733
{\an8}to join our party any day.

The nominees for Male Animal in
a Comedy, Drama or Variety Show are:

9
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,201
BoJack Horseman,
<i>Horsin' Around.</i>

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,454
<i>Now that's what I call</i>
<i>horsin' around.</i>

00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:38,706
[audience laughs and applauds]

12
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:39,915
Uh... Yeah.

13
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,377
Mr. Peanutbutter,
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter's House.</i>

17
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,802
And finally, my personal favorite,

18
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:55,389
Hank Hippopopalous,
<i>Hank After Dark!</i>

19
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,726

{\an8}And the animals' choice is...

23
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,026
Hank Hippopopalous,
<i>Hank After Dark!</i>

25
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:08,861
Oh, yeah.

[camera shutters clicking]

27
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,323
No, no, no, no.
It's because we're on a show

28
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,117
called <i>Party of Five. </i>Get it?

29
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,203
Hey, buddy,
pass me that bottle of vodka?

30
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,373
-That's not really how this works.
-It's open bar, don't be a dick.

31
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,751
-BoJack Horseman?
-Do I know you?

32
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,794
This is my better half,
Katrina Peanutbutter.

33
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,714
-Katrina, BoJack.
-I don't watch TV.

34
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:32,009
Can I get another drink now or
will that quote, unquote "embarrass" you?

35
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:36,764
-Uh, uh, no, I would never be--
-Erica! Throw me a raft. I'm dying.

36
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,682
My friends told me to get
a prenup,

37
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,143
but I was like,
"Hey, marriage lasts forever."

38
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,979
Listen, I'm doing my own thing here.

39
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,105
Can you believe two guys like us

40
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,818
were even in the same category
as Hank Hippopopalous?

41
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,236
[chuckles] That's Uncle Hanky.

42
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,197
Listen, Peanutbottle,
there is no "guys like us."

43
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,908
I'm BoJack Horseman.

44
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,535
You're just some other guy
I'll probably never talk to again.

45
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:02,205
Hey, boys.
What is this, a crossover episode?

46
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,164
[all laugh]

47
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,085
That is the funniest thing
I have ever heard.

48
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,296
Uncle Hanky.
Sir, I am your biggest fan.

49
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,299
I used to watch <i>Hank Hippopopalous's</i>
<i>Dance-Pop Cosmopolis</i>

50
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,801
every day after school.

51
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,887
-Hey, can I get a picture with you?
-Of course, kid.

52
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:21,558
Here, let me advance this. [grunts]
And we probably got it.

53
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,310
And we'll find out
in four to six weeks.

54
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,645
Yeah, I can't wait.

55
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,939
Okay, I gotta go.
My wife's hand just disappeared

56
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,356
into that busboy's pants.

57
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,693
Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.

58
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,028
Hey, kid, listen.

59
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,696
Don't beat yourself up too bad.

60
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,658
I've seen your show. You're really funny.

61
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,368
-Yeah?
-Yeah. But I'm Uncle Hanky.

62
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,121
You can't beat Uncle Hanky.

63
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,206
That's just the way it is.

64
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,959
Oh.

65
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,461
This suit needs more flasks.

66

-Diane!
-[passenger] Aah!

68
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:57,404
Will you bring me one of those
big Toblerone bars? [chuckles]

69
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,866
Well, sure. But, you know, I won't
be out there for another month.

70
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:04,578
Yes, I know, but I always forget to
write these things down.

71
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,538
Tell me, how's your little movie?

72
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,833
{\an8}Actually one of the stars just died.
It's really sad.

73
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,377
Oh, really? One person died? Just one?

74
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,047
{\an8}<i>Yeah, well, that's a real tragedy.</i>
<i>Meanwhile, Diane,</i>

75
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,508
here in Cordovia, I'm stitching
children's arms back on.

76
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,385
Oh, that's backwards, isn't it?

77
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,014
{\an8}Are you giving me a thumb's up
or a thumb's down? I can't tell.

78
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,100
{\an8}Well, now the production's
on hiatus

79
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,018
{\an8}so BoJack and I
are going on a book tour

80
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,979
to promote the new paperback edition
of <i>One Trick Pony.</i>

81
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,522
Please get here soon, Diane.

82
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:38,319
The people of Cordovia need you
and I need that Toblerone.

83
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,072
Okay, listen, you big dummy.

84
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,699
{\an8}You need to be on
your best behavior for this tour.

85
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,326
{\an8}Don't do that BoJack thing
where you go off-script

86
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,162
{\an8}and get a lot of people
mad at you.

87
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,039
{\an8}What? I don't do that.

88
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,207
{\an8}You're a movie star now.

89
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,710
{\an8}Any bad press you get
can hurt <i>Secretariat.</i>

90
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,838
<i>Now boarding, Flight 422 to Juneau.</i>

91
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,799
Please. We're going to Alaska.

92
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,760
{\an8}How am I gonna offend a bunch
of inbred Eskimo blubber-munchers?

93
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,263
{\an8}You're right. What was I thinking?

97
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,396

[dance music playing over speakers]

101
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,451
Listen. With <i>Hey, I Think You</i>
<i>Can Dance </i>as a lead-in,

102
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,163
{\an8}we are expecting big things
for <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

103
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,706
<i>What Do They Know? Do They Know Things?</i>
<i>Let's Find Out,</i>

104
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,670
or <i>H.S.A.C.W.D.T.K.D.T.K.T.L.F.O.</i>
for short.

105
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,421
-Mm.
-[Wanda] Why don't we get Hank in here?

106
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,299
You guys can get
some pictures together.

107
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,925
Hank is coming here?

108
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,303
That old guy from
<i>Hey, I Think You Can Dance?</i>

109
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,847
-What's the big deal?
-You don't understand.

110
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,017
When I was a kid,
this guy was <i>the</i> guy.

111
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,770
I even bought his novelty rap album,
<i>The Hank Hippopopalous Hip-Hop Hypothesis.</i>

112
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,981
You shouldn't meet your hero
on an empty stomach.

113
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,983
-Want me to go get you some chili?
-Good call.

114
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,651
Chili is nature's chillaxative.

115
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,321
Hiya, folks! Howdy!

116
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,406
{\an8}-Hank Hippopopalous.
-Oh, we've met.

117
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,952
Oh, oh, yeah. I remember that.

118
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,662
Okay, so, I thought for the ad,

119
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,331
you guys could stand back to back.

120
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,333
And then on the billboard it'll say:

121
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:19,546
{\an8}"Hank and Mr. Peanutbutter are back
to back. Thursdays on MBN." [laughs]

122
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,257
{\an8}So, what should I do with my arms?
Like akimbo?

123
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,508
{\an8}-You're fine.
-Reverse akimbo?

124
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,802
{\an8}-No, that--
-King Tut? Mashed Potato? Windmill?

125
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,846
{\an8}Uh-oh, I'm windmilling.
Got a momentum going.

126
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,681
-Can't stop windmilling now.
-Hey, hey.

127
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,391
Why don't we just do
what feels natural?

128
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,393
Guys like us? We're pros.

129
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,729
"Guys like us"?

130
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,522
You think I'm a guy like us?

131
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,941
Oh, this is the happiest moment
of my life.

132
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,776
Excuse me,
would you get a picture of us?

133
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,238
Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

134
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,867
Now we open the floor to questions
from the audience.

135
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:53,621
BoJack, your book talked a lot about
how much you love apple fritters.

136
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,332
Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.

137
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,624
So, my question is:

138
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,086
Do you think Israel
has a right to defend herself?

139
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,921
-Uh...
-And what part should the U.S. play

140
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:01,838
as an ally?

141
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,382
{\an8}[groans]

142
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,508
{\an8}Well, the thing about that...

{\an8}[both growl]

144
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,098
{\an8}Uh... It's a shame that Arafat
walked away from the table in 2000.

145
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,808
{\an8}I mean, obviously there's no panacea,
but a two-state solution

146
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,853
{\an8}with an emphasis on human rights
feels like a place to begin.

147
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:17,812
{\an8}[audience murmuring]

148
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,523

-[woman] Very good.

-My question is for Diane Nyu-- Nyu--
-Oh.

150
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,903
- Nyu--
-You won't get it. Ask the question.

151
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,654
Your book went to some revealing places.

152
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,449
Were you worried at all that it
would hurt BoJack or his career?

153
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,825
That's a great question.

154
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,203
I'd also like to know
the answer to that, Diane.

155
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:37,124
Well, I think the truth
is worth pursuing, no matter what.

156
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,500
BoJack's not perfect.
There are other celebrities

157
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,921
who have done much worse things
and it hasn't hurt their careers.

158
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,465
-Like who?
-I don't know, like Mike Tyson

159
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:50,553
or... Sean Penn, or Josh Brolin,
or Christian Slater, Woody Allen,

160
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,390
Hank Hippopopalous, Bill Murray...

161
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,934
Wait, wait, what about
Hank Hippopopalous?

162
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,146
Well, all of his former assistants
have made the same allegations.

163
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,564
-I feel like we're getting off track.
-Do you not know that?

164
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,192
Any questions about me,
the handsome, famous horse with a book?

165
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,944
What do you have against Uncle Hanky?

166
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,071
I'm not saying anything
not on the public record.

167
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,573
You can just Google
"Hank Hippopopalous allegations" and I--

168
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,409
Oh, you don't have to
Google it right now.

169
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,327
[all gasp]

170
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,244
Dear God.

171
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,457
Stanky Hanky?
Allegations vile and ranky.

172
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,418
But first, the visiting
Cordovian Prince Gustav

173
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,295
went missing briefly
this afternoon,

174
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,798
but he was quickly found
buying chili in Beverly Hills.

175
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,303
His official statement was,
"Uh, yeah, I'm the Prince of Cordovia.

176
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,472
Hooray, being a prince."

177
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,641
Our main story,
ominous and anomalous accusations

178
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,393
against Hank Hippopopalous.

179
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,395
Who is this anonymous Diane Nguyen

180
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,939
and what does she have against
our beloved hippopotamus?

181
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,983
Joining me now is
Hippopopalous apologist

182
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,568
and armchair sociologist,
Cardigan Burke. Cardigan,

183
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,029
{\an8}what are these allegations?

184
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,073
{\an8}These allegations are so crazy,
I can't even say them on TV

185
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,950
{\an8}or I'll sound like a crazy person.

186
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,577
{\an8}What I want to know
is why we're letting a national treasure

187
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,831
{\an8}face the same kind of smear tactics
used by the Viet Cong.

188
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,833
{\an8}Are you calling attention to the fact

189
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,461
{\an8}that Ms. Nguyen is Vietnamese?

190
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,005
{\an8}I'd like to think that's a coincidence.

191
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,092
[Peanutbutter] <i>You gotta see</i>
<i>this set they're building!</i>

192
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,802
There's a giant replica of my head,

193
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,596
and every episode, the eyes
light up with dollar signs,

194
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,850
confetti shoots out of the ears,
then I somersault out the mouth.

195
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,102
We're bringing class
back to primetime.

196
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,646
-Sounds amazing.
-And I'm really getting along

197
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,023
with J.D. Salinger.

198
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,318
-Did you know we both hate phonies?
-I did know that.

199
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,612
So... listen.
Some website called "Tit Puncher"

200
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,116
is saying you said some stuff
about Hank Hippopopalous.

201
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,785
Oh, my God, Mr. Peanutbutter,
I didn't mean for that to happen.

202
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,872
Hey, do me a favor.
Please don't make a big thing out of this.

203
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,000
It's really not a good time, you know,
with my show about to launch.

204
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,295
-Hey, we are on the same page.
-Oh, are you also on "Tit Puncher"?

205
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,214
Because you should not read
the comments.

206
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,049
Believe me,
nothing would make me happier

207
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,967
than for this to just go away.

208
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,096
-Great. I love you, too.
-[with heavy accent] Hello.

209
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,139
-Oh, my God!
-Is chili you ask for.

210
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,974
I am peasant boy Todd
from village.

211
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,686
Friend of Peanut Man, and lover
of federated American states.

212
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,856
No reason for suspicions.
[laughs] Come on!

213
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,235
Wait a second, something's different.
[sniffs]

214
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,029
I am... digging this new cologne!

215
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,906
You smell like a fancy cabbage.

216
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,326
Is so great to be
in meager trash city Los Angeles

217
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,079
with no pressures of royal life.

218
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,416
What? Royal life?
Why I'm saying? I am no royal.

219
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,042
[chuckles] Look at me. Normals.

220
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,421
There's that classic
self-deprecating Todd wit.

221
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,005
I'd know it anywhere.

222
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,678
-We will now begin our Q and A.
-Fire when ready.

223
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,932
What you got against Uncle Hanky,
you uppity cooze?

224
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,559
Diane,
I believe this question is for you.

225
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,644
If anyone here has any questions
about the book,

226
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,104
I'd be happy to answer those.

227
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,439
As would I, BoJack Horseman,

228
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,857
Golden-Globe winning
star of the book.

229
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,570
If Hank did anything wrong,
they wouldn't let him on TV, right?

230
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,614
I'm really not here
to talk about that.

231
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,532
You women are all the same.

232
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,284
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, you make these

233
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,369
broad accusations
to get attention for yourself,

234
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,747
and when you don't have proof
to back it up, you just slink away.

235
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,291
I'm not slinking away.

236
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,251
I just wanted to say one thing
about me.

237
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,505
I text and drive like all the time.
What?

238
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,966
Isn't that what happened with all
those assistants? They took his money,

239
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,676
and they don't even care
they could be ruining a man's life.

240
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,305
What? <i>They</i> ruined <i>his</i> life?

241
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,308
-You should probably just drop this.
-Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.

242
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,435
They don't even know
how much I'm gonna drop it.

243
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,979
The way you said that
made it sound like you won't drop it.

244
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,982
{\an8}How dare you spread
a narrative that--

245
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,275
{\an8}Don't tell me what to spread.

246
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,445
{\an8}I'll spread whatever I want.
It's called one of the amendments.

247
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,656
{\an8}Ladies, please! Don't get hysterical!

248
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,533
{\an8}-This is completely--
-Yeah, hi.

249
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,117
{\an8}I'm Diane's friend, BoJack.

250
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,120
{\an8}I came with her. I gotta say
I'm opposed to child labor,

251
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,705
{\an8}like as a rule, but there
are some kinds of labor

252
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,291
{\an8}that children are just better at.

253
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,043
{\an8}You ever try to fit
into a mine shaft?

254
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,962
{\an8}That is a tight squeeze. What?

255
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,382
{\an8}Oh, man, probably gonna get
some letters about that, huh?

256
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,050
{\an8}I'm so incorrigible.

257
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,553
{\an8}Everyone's paying attention
to me now!

258
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,346
{\an8}Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.

259
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,640
{\an8}Anyone else want a snack?

260
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,227
{\an8}No? That's a no?
On the snacks? Okay.

261
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,187
{\an8}What do you have against
Hank Hippopopalous?

262
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,523
{\an8}Everyone says
he's a really nice guy.

263
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,482
{\an8}Good point.

264
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,651
{\an8}That's exactly the problem.
Because he's so nice,

265
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,028
{\an8}people don't wanna think
he's capable of awful things

266
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,405
{\an8}so they let him off the hook.

267
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,533
{\an8}We don't know what happened.
It's a classic "he said, she said."

268
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,161
{\an8}"He said, <i>they</i> said."
It's eight different women.

269
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,582
{\an8}-Are they all lying?
-I mean, probably. We do that.

270
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,749
{\an8}At this point,
we just don't know enough to judge.

271
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,378
{\an8}Who are these women?
Have they ever shoplifted perhaps?

272
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,629
{\an8}Do they wear short shorts?

273
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,006
{\an8}Do they drink alcohol?
All these things are possible.

274
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,675
{\an8}We don't know the facts.

275
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,301
{\an8}See, this is part of the problem.

276
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,886
{\an8}You're supposed to be a journalist.

277
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,264
{\an8}You won't even tell your audience
what he's accused of.

278
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,015
{\an8}You're an expert.
Why don't you tell us?

279
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,308
{\an8}I'm not afraid to say it.

280
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,103
{\an8}Eight different women,
all former assistants,

281
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,939
{\an8}claim that Uncle Hanky
took them to a--

282
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,357
What is Diane doing?

283
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,444
I know. It's supposed to be my book tour
and she's upstaging me.

284
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,153
Like how it was supposed
to be my book.

285
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,030
Actually, this might be
a thing she does.

286
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,074
She knows that Hippopopalous
is the only thing

287
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,867
keeping my network afloat, right?

288
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,120
The same network
that employs her husband.

289
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,663
Why would she do this?

290
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,665
Sometimes she just whips
herself into a frenzy

291
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,543
and she loses all perspective.
Goddamn it, honeydew?!

292
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,588
Jesus, why does cantaloupe think
every time it gets invited to a party,

293
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,465
it can bring along
its dumb friend honeydew?

294
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,508
You don't get a plus-one,
cantaloupe!

295
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,884
You need to talk to her.

296
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:23,844
Huh.

297
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,515
Wanda, I just got back from a set visit
on <i>Contemporary Family.</i>

298
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,683
It's a disaster!

299
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,560
-What?
-The kids have gone through puberty.

300
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,895
They are rubbing themselves
on everything.

301
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,690
If it isn't one thing, it's ano--
Just get a hose!

302
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:45,283
Aha! I went to house to pick up mail
for you like real American Johnny.

303
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,285
-Hey, man.
-Whoa!

304
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,163
You know it's a federal crime to go
through someone else's mail?

305
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:55,876
I do not know your customs,
for I am dirt-poor servant child.

306
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,713
Oh, don't worry about it.
Now walk me through that mail.

307
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,300
Death threat for wife, death threat
for wife, once more death threat,

308
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,886
and here many monies off
for Bed Bath Beyond.

309
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,182
Seems like great U.S.A. dream castle!

310
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,058
Good Lord, that's graphic.

311
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,977
How would she even fit
one of those in there?

312
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,814
Some sort of funnel. Oh, I see,
there's actually an illustration.

313
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,277
Excuse, Dog Dog Peanut Man?
This wife, she poke bear, yes?

314
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,446
Yeah, I guess she kind of did.

315
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:27,116
They have a saying where I am from,
which is here.

316
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,118
Bear not like to be poke.

317
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,621
-Bear get angry...
-Right.

318
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,624
and destroy peasant rebel army

319
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:39,504
with fist of fire of which make
many, many nightmares

320
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,631
to children and men!

321
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,385
Todd, I can always count on you
to give me the straight dope.

322
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,345
Please don't ever change.

323
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,638

What's Gwyneth doing for Purim?

327
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,563
Diane? I want you
to meet Amanda Hannity,

328
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,565
editor-in-chief
here at <i>Manatee Fair.</i>

329
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,775
The pleasure's yours.
Walk with me, squawk with me.

330
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,111
That woman can knock a drink back like
a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy,

331
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,656
but damn if she doesn't
get shit done.

332
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,908
No. Yes. Turtleneck. You're fired.

333
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,370
Um, okay, I wanted to pitch you
an exposé on Hank Hippopopalous.

334
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,372
I would love
to take down Hippopopalous

335
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,500
and finally topple the acropolis
of monstrous hypocrisy

336
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,543
that ensconces us.

337
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,546
Hey, wouldn't your readers
prefer something more relevant?

338
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,924
Like, uh, what to do with all those
extra buttons that come with your shirts.

339
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:29,387
Amanda, I am so glad you're throwing
your weight behind this.

340
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,347
-Oh, I didn't mean--
-That dress is hideous.

341
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,057
Go home, burn it and come back.

342
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,309
When we know what we know
about a monster like that

343
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,977
and we still put him on TV
every week,

344
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,146
we're teaching a generation
of young boys and girls

345
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,023
that a man's reputation
is more important

346
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,025
than the lives of the women
he's ruined.

347
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,819
Yes, exactly!
I feel like I've been alone

348
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,822
in a crazy alternate universe
these last few days.

349
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,532
Well, you know I got your back,
right?

350
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,535
We women have got to stick to--
Hey, fruit plate.

351
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,538
No, people don't want articles
about that. People want life-hacks.

352
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,624
Diane, you need to be strong.

353
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,210
Everyone is gunning for you. You're
a woman talking out of turn about a man.

354
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,839
We're not supposed to have opinions.
We're supposed to smile and look pretty.

355
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,967
No, this model doesn't look as pretty
as the other one. Can we kill it?

356
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,678
Scarves, not just for necks anymo--

357
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,890
We need to sit you down with someone
who's willing to go on the record.

358
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,935
I already reached out to all eight
of Hank's former assistants. Nothing.

359
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,353
-What about his current assistant?
-You think she'd talk?

360
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,606
I don't know. What do you think,

I'll say it once, for your article.

381
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:36,973
I didn't do any of those things
that you're accusing me of.

382
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,141
I wanna be very clear.

383
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,728
I'm not meeting you here
because I'm scared of you.

-I think you are scared of me.
-I'm not a bad guy, Diane,

386
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,734

-Really?

-Nobody cares, Todd.

was to help you tell the story

475

476

because of that book.

You were a joke,
now people take you seriously.

You were out of work,
now you got your dream role.

479
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,517
Okay, yes. All of that is true.

480
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:54,563
But also, you were my friend
and you hurt my feelings.

481
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,691
And it's weird that
you never apologized for that...

482
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,776
and that you still won't.

483
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:03,114

I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

-Are you?
-Yes, actually. I am.

485
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,328
I didn't want to do that

486
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,998
and I probably could have
handled things better.

487
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:16,085
I definitely should have.
I'm sorry.

00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,171
Okay.

489
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,880
But this is bigger than you and me.

490
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:23,676
And I need you in my corner now
because I don't have anybody else.

491
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,719
[sighs]

492
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,471
Well, okay.

493
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,016
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

494
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,143
I'm in your corner.

495
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:37,231
Guys, earlier, some general
asked me if it was "a go"

496
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,025
...on "that thing we talked about"?

497
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:43,279
And I said, "Yes." And he said,
"God help us all" and left the room.

498
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,157
Now I'm not sure
that was the right answer.

499
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,327
So, then I called Wayne to see

500
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,745
if I could write a story for <i>Buzzfeed.</i>
Here's the good news:

501
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,039
They'll publish anything.

502
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,041
Hey, um...

503
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,250
Can I talk to you?

504
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,793
Yeah, of course. What's up?

505
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:03,381
I asked you, really nicely,
not to make a big thing out of this.

506
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,761
-Yeah, I know, but someone--
-Had to say something, right?

507
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,430
And that someone had to be you?

508
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,599
Because... why?

509
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,434
I really don't get it.

510
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:18,189
What is accomplished by you
being the one to take a stand on this?

511
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,732
-Uh...
-[sighs]

512
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,816
Mr. Peanutbutter--

513
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,944
This game show
is a really big deal for me.

514
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,405
And I know that sounds
stupid to you, and small.

515
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:31,244
But I need this to go well,
and I can't... [sighs]

516
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,703
Those are death threats.

517
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,788
People want to murder my wife

518
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,582
because of what she's
saying on the news

519
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,668
about something that
she has nothing to do with.

520
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,420
"You can't. You stupid, ugly can't."

521
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,673
-Yeah, that doesn't say "can't."
-Oh.

522
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:49,469
God, you know, you'd almost
be safer in Cordovia.

523
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,597
Yeah, maybe I should go to Cordovia.

524
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,391
I'm obviously not making
a difference here.

525
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,809
Actually, maybe you should.

526
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:59,063
Go feel good about yourself
and do your important work.

527
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:04,235
And maybe some space
might be good for us.

528
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,155
You don't really want me to go,
do you?

529
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,575
Why does it suddenly matter
what I want?

00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,710
