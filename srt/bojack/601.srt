-And while we're at it, why 12 steps?

or I'm gonna strangle you.

-No kidding.

"We want what our addictions
want us to want,

is just a house built from the materials

that is our past."

is they illustrate complicated concepts

121
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,857

is one, two, three, four, five, six?

122

Everyone, just as a general rule,

159
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,159
if you're checking into rehab
more than once,

160
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,453
-either you're a lost cause...
-[all gasp]

161
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,747
...or this is just an industry
that profits off of repeat customers,

your best interest at heart.

-Oh!
-How's that for honest?

164
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,088
Mamma mia.

165
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,718
-[blows]
-[door opens]

166
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,970
Hey, snitch! I only sneak in vodka

167
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,806
because I have to make it through
six weeks of this bullshit.

168
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,308
I don't even need to be here.

169
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,894
My dad totally overreacted
when he found me not breathing.

170
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,896
Yeah, it's always
someone else's fault, right?

171
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,024
-You have no idea what I've been through.
-I know everything you've been through.

172
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,234
I listen in group!
Your mom died of cancer.

173
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,528
Your dad stuck you in boarding school
and remarried.

174
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,281
And now there's a new baby
and no one pays attention to you.

175
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,074
But it's not his fault
you're drinking in rehab.

176
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,202
I was sober for most of last year

177
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,537
and he just waited for me to slip up
so he could ship me here

178
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,081
so I wouldn't embarrass him
and ruin his new perfect family--

179
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,291
Hey, if you don't wanna be here,

180
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,543
the gate code is one, two,
three, four, five, six.

181
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,171
You could sneak out the upstairs window
after midnight bed check

182
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,464
by tying your sheets into a rope

183
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,132
and nobody would notice
you're gone until wake-up.

184
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,760
But... is that what you really want?

185
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,470
Ugh!

186
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,972
[door closes]

187
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,560
[studio audience laughing]

188
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,145
Holy sheet!

189
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,648
I've heard of being at the end
of my rope...

190
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,275
but this is ridiculous!

191
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,070
Why would Sabrina run away like that?

192
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,156
Because I had to break it to her that you
weren't going to be her new mommy,

193
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,493
international supermodel Cindy Crawfish!

194
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,788
When I was flying to Paris
for Paris Fashion Week

195
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,123
and my private plane crashed
into your backyard,

196
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,836
the one thing I never expected
was to find someone so special.

197
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,879
-Oh.
-[both chuckle]

198
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,506
[audience] Aw!

199
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,092
-Cut! That's a five, everyone!
-[bell ringing]

200
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,803
So, look, you're doing everything great.

201
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,973
I'm loving your instincts, it's dead on,
couldn't be better, perfect.

202
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,560
The one problem is the kiss got an "aw."

203
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,355
It's supposed to get an "Ooh!"

204
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,065
-Right?
-I'm nervous, okay?

205
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,068
This is my first on-camera kiss,
and it's with Cindy Crawfish.

206
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,363
You know how many guys would kill
to be in your shoes?

207
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,489
What do I gotta do?

208
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,742
Kiss you on the lips myself
to show you what a real kiss looks like?

209
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,910
-[kisses]
-Ha-ha-ha!

210
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,622
-No. I'll handle it.
-Well, I sure as hell hope so.

211
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,499
[gulps] Mm.

212
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,544
-Hey, what's in this orange juice?
-Just a little extra punch.

213
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,379
Oh. No, no, I don't--

214
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,881
Trust me. It'll loosen you up.

215
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,180
The one thing I never expected...

216
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,183
was to find someone so special.

217
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,811
-[Cindy] Hmm!
-[audience] Ooh!

218
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,896
-[Herb] Love it! Cut and scene!
-[bell ringing]

219
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,984
Hey, no way, the party's just beginning.
Let's do one more take!

220
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,653
-You up for more acting, Cindy?
-[audience whooping]

221
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,323
Well, if it's for the show.

222
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,743
Hey, Sharona,
how 'bout some more of that OJ?

223
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,332
-[Jameson grunting] Whoa! Ow.
-Huh?

224
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,709
[panting]

225
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,252
Holy sheet.

226
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,088
I've heard of being at the end of my rope,
but this...

227
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,382
is very serious!

228
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,803
-[exhales]
-Jameson!

229
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,182
Don't cut the string that connects you
to the kite that is you!

230
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,808
-[scoffs] What?
-I don't know!

231
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,478
I was just trying to come up
with one of those dumb rehab sayings!

232
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,688
McCaitlyn told me Dathan
was thinking of breaking up with me

233
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,023
because I got fat junior year.

234
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,025
So, I need to go show him
that I'm back to being hot.

235
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,069
Then break up with him
for being a shallow buck foy!

236
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,862
You don't need to do that.

237
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,782
Oh, what does it matter?
We both know this place is bullshit!

238
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,033
So, why do you care what I do?

239
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,535
Because I'm the idiot
who helped you escape.

240
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,787
So, if you OD tonight,

241
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,706
then I'm the one who'll have to lie
to everyone about what happened.

242
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,416
Well, I'm going.

243
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,460
You can come with me if you want.

244
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,881
[sighs] God damn it.

245
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,634
[party music playing]

246
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,931
[Jameson chuckles] Oh!

247
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,641
This is your boyfriend's house?

248
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,267
-You can't go in there.
-I'll be fine.

249
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,687
I'll just find Dathan,
crush him with my thigh gap,

250
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,313
-and then we can go.
-[sighs]

251
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,065
Okay.

252
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,277
Dathan? Where are you?

253
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,364
It's me, Jameson H.!

254
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,537
[people laughing]

255
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,997
[gasps]

256
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,919
[panting]

257
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,552
[panting continues]

258
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,348
-[knocking on door]
-[boy] Hey, who's in there?

259
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,851
-Um...
-Is someone having sex in there?

260
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,603
I think there are people
having sex in there.

261
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,398
Hey, it was just the nerd.

262
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,859
Definitely no one having sex in here.

263
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,944
-[thuds]
-[grunts]

264
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,447
Um. Oh. Mm.

265
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,868
You're BoJack from Spanish 1, right?

266
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,496
-Uh, yeah. I mean, <i>sí!</i>
-[chuckles]

267
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:33,711
Okay. <i>"Sí"</i> ya around. [chuckles]

268
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,630
Ah, yeah, bye, Katie.

269
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,549
Ugh.

270
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,302
-Hey! You want a beer, Horseman?
-Oh, no, thank you.

271
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,013
I mean, drinking's cool,
it's just that we're underage,

272
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,475
-and, you know, the law--
-I'm lifting 178 right now.

273
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,559
-[keg clangs]
-[chuckles]

274
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,103
You know what? I'll have one beer.

275
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,104
[pops]

276
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,443
Okay, who am I? Who am I?

277
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,112
-"I'm Eric from chemistry class!"
-[laughter]

278
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,530
That's so Eric! [chuckles]

279
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,532
He is so in chemistry class!

280
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,993
Speaking of losers, there's Josh!

281
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,788
Look, he's wearing K-Mart shoes
because his family's poor!

282
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,706
[laughter]

283
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,462
Katie's not laughing because she always
thinks she's better than everyone.

284
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,256
Hey, remember last year
when one of Katie's boobs

285
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,758
grew bigger than the other?

286
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,344
[groans] "Look at me, I'm Katie!"

287
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,221
[laughter continues]

288
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,680
[Katie sobs]

289
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,560
-Hey, you want some?
-Oh, yeah. Bartender, one more.

290
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,481
[sighs]

291
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,234
-[Jameson screaming]
-[gasps]

292
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,112
-What's wrong?
-Dathan's sucking McCaitlyn's face!

293
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,697
Oh, my God. Jameson.

294
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,033
Okay. It is not what it looks like,
I swear.

295
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,409
You're still doing it!

296
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,120
-I tried to make it easy on you, Jameson.
-[both moaning]

297
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,248
I told you things weren't going great.

298
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,749
Oh, Dathan, touch my boob.

299
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,834
Do not touch her boob!

300
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,669
Jameson, it's not my fault you're a mess.

301
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,254
I mean, how many times
have you been to rehab?

302
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,630
Yeah, Jameson.

303
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,174
[cries]

304
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,261
[Dathan and McCaitlyn moaning]

305
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,640
[crying]

306
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,311
Look, it's okay.
You were gonna break up with him anyway.

307
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,064
-And your friend sucks.
-No, they're right.

308
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,651
I'm a mess. And no one cares.
God damn it! I might as well drink.

309
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,945
-No. You don't need a drink.
-[grunts]

310
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,905
You need to get back to bed
and get some sleep.

311
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,033
You're right. I'm gonna go home
and sleep in my bed!

312
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,744
And when my dad shows up
to ask why I'm not in rehab,

313
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,290
I'll be like, "Maybe <i>you </i>should go
to rehab for <i>your </i>addiction

314
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,500
to being a shitty dad, Dad!"

315
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,753
Okay, Jameson,
you need to be responsible for yourself.

316
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,382
Now, I think that you should come back
to Pastiches with me, like you promised.

317
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,886
But if you wanna go to your dad's house,
all you have to do is steal Dathan's car,

318
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,680
and I heard Michele with one "L"
is about to jump naked into the pool,

319
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,475
so everyone's gonna be distracted,
which means this is the perfect time.

320
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,895
-But is that really what you want?
-[car engine revving]

321
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,771
-[Jameson] Bye, BoJack! Thanks!
-What the...

322
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,815
God damn it! [grunts]

323
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,233
Stupid... [mumbling]

324
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,111
-Oh.
-[touch tones beeping]

325
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,071
[buzzing]

326
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,075
[sniffs] Hello?

327
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,077
I need you to find the address
of some rich guy.

328
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,787
-BoJack?
-All I know for sure

329
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,790
is that he's the father of a girl
named Jameson, who's super annoying.

330
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,127
I'm going to assume you have a good reason
to locate a girl

331
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,338
in the middle of the night,
but I can't help you.

332
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,341
Fine! Be that way. Todd'll help me.

333
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,595
-Can you patch me through to Todd?
-What? Call him yourself.

334
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,638
I don't know his number.

335
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,600
I only remember your number because it was
such a dumb number with all those fours.

336
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,185
Four, four, six, four...

337
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,312
My phone number
has a normal amount of fours.

338
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,022
You are not gonna make me
self-conscious about--

339
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,523
And it ends with a three!

340
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,942
Talk about an anti-climax!

341
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,319
What kind of phone number
ends with a three?

342
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,071
Shut up about my phone number!

343
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,449
-Hold for Todd.
-[beeps]

344
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,036
Todd's phone. Your one-stop shop
for all your Todd-related needs.

345
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,497
Todd, I need you to track down
an address for me.

346
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,457
You're the world's best hacker, right?

347
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,085
Yeah, but not the kind of hacker
you're thinking of.

348
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,711
-Funny story--
-Okay, I gotta go.

349
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,088
-I'm at Coachella...
-Uh-huh.

350
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,839
Put my name on the wrong list,

351
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,760
suddenly I've entered
into a hacky sack competition!

352
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,178
-Right.
-Prior to these events,

353
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,681
-I've never hacked a sack in my life.
-Uh-huh.

354
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,768
But the only other contender is
the Russian ringer they flew in special,

355
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:18,727
so I'm thinking,

356
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,271
-"I've gotta win this for America!"
-Uh-huh.

357
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:26,694
Long story short, the Russian had
a heart attack, so I won by default!

358
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,862
Uh, does that answer your question?

359
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,240
I don't remember my question,
but I'm gonna guess no.

360
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,492
-Oh, hold on, I'm getting another call.
-[beeps]

361
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,495
Todd's phone!
Spare the Todd, spoil the child!

362
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,664
Did you get the black market
porcupine milk?

363
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,082
Yeah, I'll bring it right over.

364
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,127
Although, I'm not looking forward
to getting on a crowded bus

365
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,212
-in Porcupine Town.
-[grunts]

366
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,756
-Hold on. Getting another call.
-[phone buzzes]

367
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,342
Hey, superstar!
How are things goin' on set?

368
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,178
Well, the movie itself
is coming together beautifully,

369
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,181
but when I was on break
playing with my model helicopter,

370
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,600
it crashed into the studio water tower.

371
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,561
-Oh, no!
-It gets worse!

372
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,189
It flooded the set of former VJ Downtown
Julie Brown's new puppet show.

373
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,316
-What?
-Completely ruining her vintage

374
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,860
goose-feather dress
she just bought

375
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,194
and disrupting the big finale

376
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,197
where her wooden puppet plays
Beethoven's Fifth on the bongos!

377
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,242
Wait. You're telling me
your dumb drone downed a tower

378
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,454
and drowned Downtown Julie Brown's
dummy drumming dum-dum-dum-dum,

379
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,457
dousing her newly found,
goose-down, hand-me-down gown?

380
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,293
-Yes, that is exactly right!
-I'll be right down.

381
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,669
-Todd, I gotta go.
-[beeps]

382
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,587
-Hmm.
-[beeps]

383
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,465
[muffled music playing over speakers]

384
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,968
-So, sounds like rehab's goin' well, huh?
-No!

385
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,553
[groaning]

386
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,346
Hey, give me my phone back.

387
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,392
I'm expecting some timely feedback
on an important dick pic.

388
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,894
Hey, do you know where Jameson lives?

389
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,188
Jameson H.? Or Jameson Q.?

390
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,440
-Ugh, I don't know.
-Or Jameson M.?

391
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,067
Where is the nearest Jameson?

392
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,614
-[door closes]
-[BoJack] Whoa.

393
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,116
Is that the car
from <i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off?</i>

394
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:00,245
Yeah, my dad loves movie memorabilia.
And this car is his baby.

395
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,248
At least... No, it was his baby
before the new baby came.

396
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,502
Now the new baby's the baby,
which means the car is the new me,

397
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,837
so where does that leave me? Nowhere.

398
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,422
What are you talking about?

399
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,093
He threw out all of my stuff
and turned my room into the baby's room.

400
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:18,472
He got rid of my softball trophies,
but he loves his stupid bat, naturally.

401
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,767
-And his dumb stupid car!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

402
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,268
-[crying]
-Parents are terrible.

403
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,562
But destroying things
isn't gonna change them.

404
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,314
All you can change is you.

405
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,941
Ugh. Fine.

406
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,736
If I'm gonna get lectured anyway,
I may as well go back to rehab.

407
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,074
-[glass shattering]
-[woman moans]

408
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,868
Dad, you there?

409
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,412
Mom said since you didn't come home,
I should bring you your dinner.

410
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:46,291
And she said to tell you she hopes
you like cold, burnt pot roast

411
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,459
that was spit on.

412
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,502
-[woman moaning]
-Huh?

413
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,419
Dad?

414
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,339
There it is, coax it out of my sheath.

415
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,049
[gasps]

416
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,717
BoJack! What the devil!

417
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,095
I-- I'll get right on that memo,
Mr. Horseman.

418
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,264
Okay, let me... Oops, oh. [chuckles]

419
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,142
Okay, let me just...
Oh, you look so cute. Bye-bye. All right.

420
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,435
-What were you doing, Dad?
-Oh.

421
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,688
It's fun to have you
at the office, BoJack.

422
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,190
-You're really turning into a man.
-I am?

423
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,652
I think you're old enough now
to have a Jack and Coke.

424
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,822
Mm, nice and sweet.

425
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:21,410
Here's to our first drink
as father and son.

426
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,834
[car horns honking]

427
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,003
[groans]

428
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,256
Huh?

429
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,677
-Did I fall asleep? I feel sick.
-[laughs]

430
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,930
You went a little wild.
You made a mess on my carpet, BoJack.

431
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,725
I think your mother
would be very disappointed in you.

432
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,642
I'm sorry.

433
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:51,190
Maybe it's best if we both just forgot
about everything that happened tonight.

434
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,109
-Okay, buddy?
-Okay.

435
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,283
You know what? Screw your dad.

436
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,701
Whoa!

437
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,579
Hey! That's the titular club
from <i>The First Wives Club.</i>

438
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,080
You're just a kid.

439
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,459
Why do you have to be responsible
for all the ways he screwed you up?

440
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,752
Yeah!

441
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,170
[grunts]

442
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:17,674
It's not my fault I was born!
He's the one who got my mom pregnant!

443
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,636
Yeah, and I bet your mom sucked too!

444
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,013
[gasps] Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

445
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,183
Chick ch'ka... Oh, no.

446
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,560
-Oh, my...
-[thuds]

447
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,270
-[both sigh]
-[car squeaks]

448
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,272
[glass cracking]

449
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,523
-Wha...
-Oh, boy.

450
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,652
-[door opens]
-[baby crying]

451
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,987
What the hell are you doing?

452
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,114
That's the giant window from <i>The Graduate!</i>

453
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,032
Oh.

454
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:47,037
Daddy, I didn't wanna leave rehab,
but this scary old horse made me!

455
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,538
Hi, cutie! Mwah!

456
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,958
Okay, I'm ready to go back to rehab now.
I'll go wait in the car!

457
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,459
Jameson... [sighs]

458
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,586
-Listen--
-Are you drunk or high?

459
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,922
-What?
-Are you drunk or high right now?

460
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,882
-No.
-[sighs]

461
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,509
I'm sorry she roped you into this.

462
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,844
You're not the first guy to help her
break out of that rehab.

463
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,388
They always end up at my house.

464
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,431
And then they want me to keep quiet
to the press,

465
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,101
so they give me a souvenir
from one of their movies.

466
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,437
I could send you a swag bag
from Felicity Huffman's <i>Booty Academy,</i>

467
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,731
but you should probably wash the thong
before wearing it.

468
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:19,319
I don't know what to do with Jameson.
I've tried everything.

469
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,447
I thought she would change
after she had her baby, but...

470
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,241
[baby cooing]

471
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,034
Change is hard.

472
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,744
Takes a long time.

473
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,288
[sighs]

474
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,498
Let me guess,
she wanted to see her boyfriend?

475
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,959
Actually...

476
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,713
she told me she just wanted
to come here to see her baby.

477
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,133
[sighs] Wouldn't that be nice?

478
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,941
Bye, Daddy! Love you!

479
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,445
-Ugh. Sorry my dad's so embarrassing.
-Jesus Christ.

480
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,155
You have no idea how lucky you are.

481
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,198
I wish I had someone when I was your age

482
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,659
who cared about me enough
to put me in rehab.

483
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,037
Yeah, maybe.

484
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,248
Well, anyway, thanks for keeping me
out of trouble tonight.

485
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,376
Really?

486
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,254
It was a worth a try.
Ready to sneak back in?

487
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm getting too old to sneak in
and out of places.

488
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:22,883
All right.

489
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,601
[bell dinging]

490
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:33,935
-Checking in?
-No.

491
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,063
I just snuck out and I'm coming back,

492
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,399
so, you know, put me down
for kitchen clean-up duty

493
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,568
or whatever the punishment is
for sneaking out.

494
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,112
No, I don't think you've been here before.

495
