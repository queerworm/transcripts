00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,181
Someone find out the average rainfall
in Bora Bora.

3
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,808
Thank you so much for doing this.

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,520
Hey, there are a lot of advantages to
being the girlfriend of a big celebrity.

5
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,813
It's more than being an elbow

6
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,273
they couldn't crop out of
a red-carpet shot in <i>US Weekly.</i>

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,067
-I've been that elbow.
-Hello, what have we here?

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,069
So you know
how the game's played, right?

9
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,155
I'm sure I'll pick it up.
How hard could it be?

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,240
You didn't read the treatment?
I faxed it to you.

11
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,910
My bad, our fax machine
isn't plugged in.

12
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,745
BoJack, this is our first show

13
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,665
and it is very important that things
run smoothly tonight.

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,709
I mean, do you even care
about this at all?

15
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,379
Sweetie, no. I think this is stupid
and a waste of everybody's time.

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,756
But you're my girlfriend
and I care about you.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,175
-So I'm here.
-Okay. Break a leg.

18
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,846
[vocalizing] Me, me, me. My, my, my.
Bow-wow-wow-wow.

19
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,056
Good boy, good boy.

20
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,726
Okay, this is it, everybody.
Moment of truth.

21
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,435
Now it's in the hands of god.

22
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,689
And for the next 30 minutes,
I am that God.

23
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,941
-I got you an iPad, ma'am.
-Oh, no thanks, Mia.

24
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:09,028
I'm still working my way through
the last 30 years of technology.

25
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,404
Right now I'm on Palm Pilot.

26
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,032
But you can use our second screen app
to see what viewers say

27
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,366
about the show as it airs.

28
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:18,203
Oh, cool,
I love stupid bullshit like this. Ooh.

29
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,413
Oh, you just touch it.

30
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:24,501
Hello, I am Mustache Todd.
Like regular Todd, but with a mustache.

31
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,630
Listen boo-boo, I didn't graduate first in
my class from a prestigious university,

32
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,299
rise through the ranks at
an elite news organization,

33
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,011
win a well-known award,
never ever be sick at sea

34
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:38,057
and also my name is Mia McKibben,
so that I could deal with your nonsense.

35
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,141
-[grunts]
-Todd, stay out of Hair and Makeup.

36
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,351
But I like it there.

37
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,229
They brush my hair and tell me stories
about their weekends.

38
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,482
Big-nosed Todd wasn't funny,
Zombie Todd wasn't funny,

39
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,234
Pretty Lady Todd wasn't funny,

40
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,528
and this isn't funny.
No more tomfoolery.

41
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,197
When it's me,
we call it "Todd-foolery."

42
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,491
We certainly do not call it that.

43
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,576
Listen up, everyone.

44
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,828
What you are part of tonight
is bigger than you.

45
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,204
It's bigger than any of us.

46
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,040
I expect all of you to work together.

47
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,251
But I also expect that one of you
will tower above the rest.

48
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:11,757
And that outstanding individual
will receive this pen.

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,217
It was through this pen that I bled

50
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,805
<i>Raise High The Roof Beam,</i>
<i>Carpenters </i>upon the page.

51
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,514
Also, it has four different colors.

52
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,309
Black, red, blue
and for some reason, green.

53
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,644
By the end of tonight,

54
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:27,481
this pen will be bestowed upon
the person most deserving.

55
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,191
Because nothing is more
important than television,

56
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,071
and no one more important than
the people who make that television.

57

{\an8}Hey, this is Mr. Peanutbutter's show,
so be nice.

71
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,413
{\an8}When you say nice, do you mean kind?

{\an8}Or, like,
delivering a lot of sick burns,

73

00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,552
it's time to pick your category.

113
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:50,517
"Trigonometry." "Advanced Physics,"
and "At the Movies With Mr. Peanutbutter."

114
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,393
At the Movies With
Mr. Peanutbutter.

115
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:56,815
Good choice. After seeing J.J. Abrams'
<i>Star Trek </i>reboot, did I call it:

116
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,067
{\an8}A, "A visual feast for the senses,"

117
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,987
{\an8}B, "A zestful lark through time
and space,"

118
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,199
{\an8}C, "The best Zachary Quinto movie
of all time,"

119
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,492
{\an8}or D, "All of the above"?

120
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:11,663
{\an8}-I'll say D?
-Ouch, the answer was A and B.

121
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,248
<i>Though I would</i>
<i>also agree with C.</i>

122
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,417
So I told Mr. Peanutbutter
I'd drive him here,

123
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,378
and next thing I know,
I'm an Associate Producer.

124
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,756
Stupid me. I went to Stanford.

125
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,551
Next time I'll just try that
thing where I'm a huge dumbass

126
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,803
who happens to be friends
with Mr. Peanutbutter.

127
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:27,804
-Yup.
-Cool.

128
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,723
Well, have fun watching me
win that pen.

129
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,849
I don't need a pen.

130
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:35,687
I can walk into any Chili's with a child
under 12 and get crayons for free.

131
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,022
You don't get it.

132
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,858
If Salinger gives you his pen,
that means you're worth something.

133
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,736
It means you're a serious person
who's going places.

134
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,698
Actually, you know what?
Don't worry about it. It's not for you.

Surprised you didn't get that one,

141
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,924
since you're an expert

Oh, yeah, pretty good one from King Mutt

You know, like King Tut?

146
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,939
Because we're talking about Egypt?
And Mr. Peanutbutter's a mutt, so...

00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,441
You suck.

148

of ribbing going on here.

00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,797
I'm not ribbing you.
I'm telling you, you're--

00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,934
[audience chuckling]

163
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,437
Wow. J.D., people are loving this show.

164
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,150
Wait till they see this.
Mia, get ready to drop the bomb.

165
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,277
[woman] <i>Death from above!</i>
[Bojack gasps]

166
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,739
Uh-oh. That sound means it's time
to drop "da" bomb.

167
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,992
And yes folks, I said "da," not "the."

168
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,411
What I'm trying to say is,
it's a positive bomb.

169
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,121
Audience, let's...

170
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,581
[audience] Drop da bomb!

171
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,460
{\an8}Did you guys all practice
before the show, because--

172
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:26,214
Ladies and gentlemen, we've had
some fun with our little celebrity.

173
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,467
But now, let's meet our big celebrity.

174
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,885
-Big celebrity?
-Say hello to...

175
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,597
{\an8}-Daniel Radcliffe!
-Hi, I'm Daniel Radcliffe. Hello.

176
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,392
-Oh, my God! It's Daniel Radcliffe!
-[audience cheering]

177
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:41,396
We'll find out what our big celebrity
knows right after this break.

178
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,856
[BoJack groans]

179
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,734
And we're out.
Oh, we're cooking now.

180
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,696
Hey, you, you're doing great.

181
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,656
I'm not 100 percent watching

182
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,700
because I'm so engrossed
in the second screen experience,

183
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,785
but according to
the second screen experience,

184
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,620
other people are loving the show.

185
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,747
You didn't tell me
there would be another celebrity.

186
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,375
Well, I had no idea that was coming

187
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,170
but some guy named Dong-Slinger-420
loved the surprise.

188
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,172
He said, "Two dongs way up."

189
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,591
There was no mention of another bigger
celebrity in the document you faxed?

190
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,345
I couldn't read it. My fax machine
cut it into little strips.

191
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,390
-That sounds like a shredder.
-Well, I guess I shredded it to you.

192
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,765
-[iPad chimes]
-I gotta deal with this.

193
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,185
If I don't interact with this app
every 80 seconds,

194
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,896
it charges my credit card five dollars.
Love you.

195
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,398
[mumbling] Ehh... you, too.

196
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,400
Could you get the base
a little less pale?

197
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,152
-Hey, Daniel, good to see you.
-Always nice to meet a fan.

198
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:33,323
-No, sorry, I'm not a, uh-- I'm an actor.
-Oh, good for you.

199
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,700
It's a dreadful business
but hang in there.

200
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,245
No, I already did hang in there.
I'm BoJack Horseman?

201
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,538
We've actually met before.

202
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,832
At Chris Martin's holiday party?
We stepped outside for a smoke?

203
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,667
-To get away from Chris Martin?
-Huh.

204
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,794
You opened up
about your fear of success?

205
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,088
I gave you some advice?

206
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,591
You said I was a true friend
and you would never forget me?

207
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,261
And you said your name
was Chadwick Boseman?

208
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,304
-BoJack Horseman.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

209
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,516
When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people.

210
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,268
Sorry, we need you guys back on set.

211
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,187
You were the second hairdresser's
assistant on <i>The Ellen Show</i>

212
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,147
about five years ago.
Veronica, right?

213
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,025
-Yeah, that's right.
-How was your mother's party in the end?

214
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:13,113
And we're back in five, four,
three, two...

215
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,781
So you never say one, huh?

216
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,909
-Welcome back, America.
-[man] We love you, Daniel.

217
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,871
[laughs] So do I. So let's watch
our celebrities go... Audience?

218
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,374
[all] Head to head!

219
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,167
<i>How could they possibly know that?</i>

220
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,420
<i>-This is the first episode, right?</i>
-[J.D. laughs]

221
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:32,257
The puppets clap
when the puppetmaster pulls the strings.

222
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,594
Hello. Serious,
Going-Places Todd at your service.

223
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,763
Hey, look at you, all dressed up
for the Dipshit Awards.

224
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,015
You know you're not allowed
in Hair and Makeup.

225
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,935
-Are you wearing roller skates?
-I'm wearing Heelys.

226
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,771
They're shoes with wheels,
for efficiency purposes.

227
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:50,817
-Now I can be serious faster.
-You can also go nowhere faster.

228
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,361
Seeing as I am a professional--

229
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,405
No!

230
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,324
-[buzzer sounds]
-Oh, BoJack.

231
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,576
Another embarrassingly
wrong answer,

232
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,830
bringing your score down
by 80 points and 12 dollars.

233
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,999
Why are we playing
for both points and dollars?

234
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,668
-Oh, tough break, B.J. Novak!
-My name is--

235
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,545
Our next question is to Mr. Radcliffe.

236
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:14,841
"What color comes from
the combination of blue and yellow?"

237
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,134
I actually know this one.

238
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,637
When I was growing up,
my neighbor was a painter.

239
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,097
I remember visiting his flat
and watching him work.

240
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,225
Sometimes he would mix together
blue paint with yellow paint

241
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,144
and it made an entirely new color.

242
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,855
And that man was Banksy.
And that color was green.

243
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,107
-Final answer.
-Correct!

244
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,151
You've earned
the chance to go for a spin

245
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,529
in our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth.

246
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,447
[audience cheering]

247
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,324
Oh, splendid.

248
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,743
And while Daniel's in the booth,
BoJack, you have an essay question.

249
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,996
-What?
-You'll find a blue book on your podium.

250
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,041
"To what extent was feudalism
a cause of the French Revolution?"

251
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,708
-Wait, are you ser-- Oh!
-And go!

252
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,878
While BoJack works,
let's check out the action

253
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,673
-on our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth Cam.
-[audience cheers]

254
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,716
-Hey, champ.
-What are you doing here?

255
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,968
I'm trying to write an essay.

256
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,719
I came to ask you how you were doing

257
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,014
and then to tell you
you're not doing so well.

258
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,723
Why am I getting
the hard questions,

259
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,976
while Boy Wizard over there
just has to know colors

260
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,978
and literally grab cash out of thin air?

261
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,939
[Daniel laughs] A five! This is so easy!

262
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,485
I think I might be able to help you out.
Let me tell you a story.

263
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,487
<i>The year was 2003</i>

264
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,865
<i>and for some reason, everyone was</i>
<i>playing poker all of a sudden.</i>

265
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:25,412
<i>A then-relevant Wilmer Valderrama</i>
<i>used to host a weekly how-do-you-do</i>

266
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,747
<i>and all the stars</i>
<i>came out to show off their tricks.</i>

267
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:33,169
<i>There was Lucy Lawless, Lucy Liu,</i>
<i>Lori Laughlin, Lisa Loeb,</i>

268
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,089
<i>the dog from </i>Frasier,
<i>and at the head of the table?</i>

269
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,800
<i>Big Money himself, Mr. Peanutbutter.</i>

270
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,219
Whoops. Woh-oh.

271
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,346
<i>I thought, "Here's a rube."</i>

272
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:44,931
[laughs]

273
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,309
<i>But Lady Luck had other plans.</i>

274
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,852
You know what,
I got an essay to write,

275
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,689
so if this isn't about the precipitous
fall of the French ruling class--

276
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,734
<i>But then I saw, the kid had a tell.</i>

277
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,197
I feel like that story had a lot
of unnecessary details in it.

278
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,701
Listen. You have to pay close attention,
it's subtle,

279
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:10,206
but when he gets excited, his ears ever
so slightly flop up and give him away.

280
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,668
Well, that's no surprise. Guy's been
flopping upwards his whole career.

281
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:16,588
Mm-hm. Watch the ears.

282
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,298
[horn blows]

283
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,508
Time's up, Daniel.

284
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:24,053
Whoa, looks like D to the R
to the Ad to the Cliffe

285
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,098
just won 54,000 bonus dollars.

286
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,060
And BoJack barely got beyond
his thesis statement.

287
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,019
[audience laughing]

288
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,564
[clears throat]
"A continent ravaged by war,

289
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,400
coupled with the retreat
of the church from secular life..."

290
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,444
-And then it just stops?
-[audience laughs]

291
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,363
Oh, that's gonna cost
you some serious pesos.

292
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,450
But first, it's time for
our Multiple Choice Buzz-In Round.

293
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,201
A buzz-in round? All right.

294
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,704
In is my favorite direction
in which to buzz.

295
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,206
Tell me, "How many oak trees are needed

296
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,795
to build an 18th century triple-decker
Royal Navy battle ship?

297
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,298
A, 75? B, 1000?

298
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,425
Or C, 3500?"

299
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,552
C! 3500!

300
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,721
-Um, correct.
-Uh, what?

301
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,723
-Uh, wow. That's, uh...
-[mild applause]

302
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,391
That's actually correct.

303
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,936
How the hell did he know that? What else
does he know? Does he know things?

304
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,937
Let's find out.

305
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,026
Quantum tunneling.
King Magnus the Second.

306
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,529
Miss Scarlet in the library
with the lead pipe.

307
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,532
Sassafras. Butterscotch! Argyle.

308
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,409
-Because seven eight nine.
-[buzzes]

309
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:32,079
What an amazing run.
It looks like we've got a tied game.

310
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,082
Which is an exciting surprise.

311
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,044
-Goddamn it, throw to commercial.
-We'll be right back.

312
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,338
[lively music playing over speakers]

313
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:44,801
-Hey. Horshack. What's going on?
-What's going on is I'm kicking your ass.

314
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,887
{\an8}Yeah, you know, you're doing great,
but I'm supposed to win.

315
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,557
{\an8}That was the deal.
Plug my movie, win money for charity.

316
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,642
{\an8}Well, tell Charity she can kiss my ass.

317
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,394
{\an8}By the way,
your girlfriend has a stripper name.

318
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,605
{\an8}It's not my girlfriend, it's charity.

319
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,737
BoJack, according to this app,
you're almost tied.

320
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,698
Oh, you are tied, there's a lag.
Congratulations.

321
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,449
Thanks. It was touch and go--

322
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,909
But I'm a little concerned

323
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,579
because it seems like
you might actually win,

324
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,248
but everyone on the app
is really rooting for Daniel.

325
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,416
People love him.

326
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:20,587
I guess he was in some movie about a
potter or a Pottery Barn or something?

327
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,882
-Are you asking me to throw the game?
-You don't care about this game.

328
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,427
The only reason you're here is for me,
so maybe you could help me out?

329
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,470
-[sighs] Okay.
-You know what?

330
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,724
You're the best, no matter
what everybody on this app says.

331
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:37,978
They say you're the worst. Especially
Queefburglar69. He's their leader.

332
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,898
[audience cheering]

333
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:44,569
And we're back. Contestants, I've got
a history question for both of you.

334
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:50,408
"You may or may not be familiar with a
famous racehorse named Secretariat.

335
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,536
In what year did Secretariat
win the Triple Crown?"

336
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,788
-[buzzer sounds]
-BoJack.

337
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,372
Piece of cake.

338
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,124
Hmm?

339
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,417
[sighs]

340
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,961
Um, 1492?

341
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,672
-[audience and Daniel laughing]
-What? No, not even close.

342
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,675
BoJack, aren't you in a movie
about Secretariat?

343
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,262
-How could you not know that?
-Let's just move on.

344
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,306
Maybe instead,
he should be in a movie

345
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,810
about a guy who doesn't know
anything about Secretariat. [laughs]

346
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,394
That would not be a good movie.

347
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,689
I mean, more like Secre-terrible.

348
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,609
{\an8}Damn, Bojangles, you got served.

349
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,404
Do you know anything about Secretariat?
You know he was a horse, right?

350
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,782
Oh, wait, did I just spoil it for you?

351
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,827
No wonder my wife
had to write your book for you.

352
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:38,038
Hey, yeah, you know, while we're talking
about your wife, I've got a question.

353
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,208
How come your wife flew
all the way to war-torn Cordovia

354
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,669
just to get away from you?

355
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,711
[people murmuring]

356
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,130
That's not what happened.
She went to help people.

357
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,634
Or maybe she went to help herself
get away from her awful marriage.

358
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:50,718
[audience gasping]

359
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,722
-Oh, was that too far?
-Oh-ho, you want to get into things?

360
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,141
-Well, I mean--
-No, no, no, let's get into things.

361
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:01,103
Let's get real.
Everybody, BoJack wants to get real.

362
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:05,107
Cancel the Bubble Round.
Because we're getting real.

363
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,651
[production assistant sighs]

364
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,152
Should we cut to commercial?

365
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,321
Would Homer cut away
from Odysseus's journey

366
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,366
just as he was being enticed
by the sirens' song?

367
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,951
No?

368
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,494
Well, there you are.

369
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,622
Things are getting real out here.
Really real.

370
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,416
Really, really, really real!

371
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,377
{\an8}[audience member clears throat]

372
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,838
-Uh, I'm not sure where you're going--
-Oh, no?

373
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,840
You knew
where you were going with my wife

374
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,175
that time you pulled over
by the side of the road.

375
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,553
-You know, a week before we got married?
-Uh...

376
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,722
You want to talk about that, BoJack?

377
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:40,727
You want to talk about the time when you,
my "good friend," kissed my wife?

378
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,102
-No!
-Yes.

379
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,646
Did something
exciting just happen?

380
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,274
Because people on the app are,
and I quote, "losing their tits."

381
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,486
Oh, no, no, I've stumbled on to
a cancer support message board.

382
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,821
Okay, how do I...?

383
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,197
How did you know about that?

384
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,034
Well, there are roadside cameras
all along the PCH,

385
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,118
I have a few friends
in the highway patrol,

386
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,329
and she told me, of course! We're married!

387
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,624
Wait, so you've known all this time?

388
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,627
Now this is television. Turn on the rain.

389
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,129
Um, don't you think
you're pushing them too far?

390
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,592
I'll tell you when it's too far.
This is my art, goddamn it.

391
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:17,597
I'm J. goddamn D.
goddamn Salinger, and I want rain!

392
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,640
[thunder rumbling]

393
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,019
All I ever wanted was to be your friend.

394
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,397
And you treat me like a big joke.

395
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,816
You think I don't notice?
Why don't you like me?

396
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,027
-Mr. Peanutbutter--
-No, tell me.

397
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,154
-Because... I'm jealous.
-Oh.

398
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,491
-Of what? Diane?
-No.

399
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,787
Of everything.
Everything comes so easy for you.

400
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,371
Oh, and it doesn't for you?

401
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,625
You're a millionaire movie star
with a girlfriend who loves you,

402
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,420
acting in your dream movie.
What more do you want?

403
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,757
What else could
the universe possibly owe you?

404
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,677
I want to feel good about myself.

405
00:18:56,761 --> 00:19:00,306
The way you do.
And I don't know how.

406
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,933
I don't know if I can.

407
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,185
Whoa, guys, this is getting
a little heavy, don't we think?

408
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,438
I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.

409
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,732
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

410
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:14,779
Wow, um, I don't know
if I can forgive you.

411
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,240
But I guess we'll find out
right after this break.

412
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,492
[audience cheering]

413
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,369
-Damn.
-Shut up.

414
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,622
[all cheering]

415
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,375
I knew it. I knew this show would
bring us to the heights of human drama

416
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,837
more powerfully than literature
ever dreamed.

417
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,090
Now somebody go out and get me
a Red Bull and a banana fish sandwich.

418
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,551
On it. It's a perfect day for a Red Bull.

419
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,845
Whoa-oh!

420
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,514
-Mr. Peanutbutter!
-Oh, hey Wanda.

421
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,725
I'm only half paying attention
to whatever you two are arguing about

422
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,645
but it's killer.
Now all we need is a happy ending.

423
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,773
I don't think we can just resolve
everything cleanly in a half-hour.

424
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,608
Uh, this is network television.

425
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,904
So resolving everything cleanly
in a half-hour is kind of what we do.

426
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,991
You want to host a game show where
everyone feels bad at the end?

427
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:03,661
You can get in your little car, drive to
Santa Monica and pitch it to AMC.

428
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,497
But these people want resolution, okay?

429
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,668
So you get your little butt back
on that stage and you resolve.

430
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,295
-Uh...
-[audience applauding]

431
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,131
And we're back.

432
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,551
You know, I did some thinking
over the break. BoJack--

433
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,511
-[electricity powers down]
-[audience gasps]

434
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,846
-What's going on?
-Oh, my God.

435
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,556
No! No! What's happening?

436
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,183
-[all chattering]
-Oh.

437
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,353
[electricity powers up]

438
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:33,357
Someone unplugged the main power line
and plugged in a George Foreman Grill.

439
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,527
Panini time. Hey, who unplugged--

440
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,279
Todd! Goddamnit, step aside!

441
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,449
Mia, good work.
You saved the show.

442
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,828
You earned my respect... and this pen.

443
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,706
-Oh, thank you.
-[all cheering]

444
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,958
Aww.

445
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,921
Oh, are we back? We're back!
Live television, folks.

446
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,007
You know, during the break,
my producers told me

447
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,885
I had to forgive BoJack
live on the air.

448
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,178
[audience booing]

449
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,097
But I'm my own dog.

450
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,807
And as my own dog, I decided

451
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:10,728
to forgive BoJack live on the air!
Bring it in, buddy!

452
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,854
-What?
-Really?

453
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,398
Mr. Peanutbutter,
I applaud your forgiving nature,

454
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,026
but this guy kissed your wife.

455
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,195
Wait, BoJack kissed Diane?

456
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,574
The only way to even the score
is if you get to kiss him.

457
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,160
-Wait, what?
-You're right, it makes perfect sense.

458
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,995
-Yeah, absolutely.
-No, it doesn't.

459
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,581
That way Diane and I will have
had the same experience.

460
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,917
It's the only way we can move past this.

461
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,834
[sighs]

462
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,087
Well, if it helps us move past this,
I guess...

463
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,716
[Daniel and audience] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

464
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,094
[J.D.] Cue the Kiss Cam.

465
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,304
[love song playing over speakers]

466
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,686
Oh, if only I'd had a Kiss Cam
for <i>Catcher In The Rye.</i>

467
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,065
Well, just one more regret
on a long list of many.

468
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,987
Todd, there you are. You're missing
a pretty big moment out there.

469
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,366
I don't care. You said it yourself.
Without that pen, I'm totally worthless.

470
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,954
Not for nothing, but you were worthless
before you didn't get the pen.

471
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:16,335
I really tried this time. I guess
I'll never really amount to anything.

472
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:20,339
Well, maybe you just need
someone to believe in you.

473
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:24,010
Wow, no one's ever
fallen for that!

474
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,595
-What?
-You're so stupid!

475
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,308
You had the pen
and you just gave it to me?!

476
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,768
Oh, I can't believe that worked.

477
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:36,230
Oh, my God, look at your stupid face.

478
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,940
The pen is just a symbol.
It doesn't--

479
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,443
Yeah, said the girl
who doesn't have a pen right now.

480
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,614
Unbelievable. You are the most annoying,
immature, aggravating,

481
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,574
irritating, crazy-making...

482
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:51,120
Oh, she was mad, all right. But kids?

483
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,999
That's the story of
how I met... this pen.

484
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,250
[laughs]

485
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,128
Hey, get out of Hair and Makeup
and give me back my pen!

486
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,380
I got your pen.
That means you respect me.

487
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,092
-No it does not.
-Viva Todd-foolery!

488
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,886
Suck a dick, dumbshits.

489
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,762
-Hey! Hey, hey!
-[blows raspberry]

490
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,724
-[lively music playing over speakers]
-[audience cheering]

491
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,894
Well, that stern but supple kiss
puts you over the top.

492
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,437
BoJack Horseman is tonight's winner.

493
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,939
[dog howls]

494
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,399
-Well played, Jock-jam Door-slam.
-[groans]

495
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,611
You've earned $500,000 for charity.

496
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:29,575
You can walk away right now
or, and remember, this is for charity,

497
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,578
you can risk it all in
our Double or Nothing round.

498
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,955
[audience clamoring]

499
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,832
{\an8}I wanna risk it all!

500
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,169
All right. Now that's $500,000.

501
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,546
If you get this question right,
you double that,

502
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,422
a million dollars for charity.

503
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,759
But if you get it wrong,
the charity gets nothing

504
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:51,555
and all the money will be set on fire
live here on our studio soundstage.

505
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,225
BoJack, for all the marbles:

506
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,103
"Which famous actor
played the titular role

507
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,731
in the popular <i>Harry Potter</i>
film franchise?"

508
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,983
-[audience] Oh.
-Huh.

509
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,485
Yeah. I don't know.

510
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,322
When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people,

511
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:10,574
it's impossible to remember them all.

512
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,035
Okay, I get what you're doing. Very funny.

513
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,330
Yeah. Oh, what is that guy's name?

514
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,832
You know, it's on the tip of my tongue?

515
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,294
Are you serious right now?
Dude, this is for charity.

516
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,046
-BoJack, we need an answer.
-Yeah, I don't know.

517
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,881
Gosh, I wanna say...

518
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,844
-Elijah Wood?
-What?

519
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,555
