00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,569
Hey, loved you in
<i>The Caveman's Valentine.</i>

166
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,529
- Hmm?
- Nothing? <i>The Caveman's Valentine?</i>

167
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,407
Samuel L. Jackson had that big beard?
Look it up.

168
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,242
- When you start laughing, call me.
- Will do.

169
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,244
Do we have an offer
on the <i>Pegasus</i> movie?

170
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,455
I'll get it, Kalamata.
Don't get your pita in a wad.

171
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,832
Wow. <i>Flight of the Pegasus.</i>

172
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,918
This must be
what Robert Downey Jr. felt like

173
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,794
when he woke up on that
stranger's bathroom floor

174
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,588
and found out he was gonna be Iron Man.

175
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:31,928
[man on radio] <i>It's another unseasonably</i>
<i>warm day in the Labrador Peninsula</i>

176
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,388
<i>and things are looking sunny</i>
<i>all the way to the new year.</i>

177
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,973
<i>It really is true what they say...</i>

178
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,893
[both] Nothing bad ever happens
on the Labrador Peninsula.

179
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,478
Oh, paradise.

180
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,151
[children laugh]

181
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,246
Uncle Mister. Uncle Mister.

182
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,666
Now who let these little monsters
onto my peninsula?

183
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,917
We're your nephews.

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,129
What? I don't remember my nephews
being made out of candy.

185
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,507
- Gobble, gobble, gobble.
- [all laugh]

186
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:14,011
Look at those children.
Little miracles, right?

187
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:18,099
They're adorable, not that
I value them based on their looks.

188
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,308
Because, of course,

189
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,228
children in society today
are often reduced to their cuteness.

190
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,314
I can't wait to get
to know your children as people,

191
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,817
so I can specifically
compliment them individually

192
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,027
on the foundation of their characters.

193
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,406
Well, one day they'll die, just like us.

194
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,323
Uh...

195
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,242
- Do you believe in the soul?
- What?

196
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:41,372
Life is the most precious resource
we have. Remember that, Diane.

197
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,748
Okay.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,627
[laughs] Pretty great, right?

199
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,923
Did you tell your brother
about the A-B-O-R-T-I-O-N?

200
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,718
The audition?
No, I could never tell him about that.

201
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,053
He thinks I'm offer-only,
it would break his heart.

202
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,263
Wait, what audition?

203
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,433
- No, the abortion.
- Oh, no. Should I have?

204
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,227
He said some weird stuff to me earlier.

205
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,730
The kind of stuff you'd hear
in a sad Creed song.

206
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,523
Or a happy Elliott Smith song.

207
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,902
Oh, he's probably just razzing ya,
but he's a good dog. All bark, no bite.

208
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,364
Sorry, that's a Labrador expression.
I guess in human terms it would be:

209
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,368
He's all talk, and no shooting you
with an assault rifle.

210
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,245
Is that what you think humans do?

211
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,371
Am I wrong?

212
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,001
[Rutabaga] Boom! This is David Pincher.

213
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,504
And this is everyone who works for him.

214
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,797
Now unfortunately for us,

215
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,759
everyone on this board
must really like their boss's movies,

216
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,763
because for the holidays,
they're all <i>Gone Girl.</i>

217
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,641
Thank you, except for her. Boom.

218
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,061
The assistant to David Pincher's
casting director.

219
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,481
Wait a second, I know that face.
Why does she look so familiar?

220
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,941
- Oh, fish.
- Oh, fish.

221
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,153
So when I found out
that the best assistant I ever had

222
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,946
was working for David Pincher,

223
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,573
I mean, what are the odds?

224
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,951
Did he hire you because of your cute
little Benjamin Button-nose?

225
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,538
I'll put in a good word for BoJack,
but I'm just an assistant.

226
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,000
Just an assistant?
Laura, assistants are everything.

227
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,336
You're the first people in,
the last people out.

228
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,089
You know everyone's real name, age,
nose, teeth, and tits.

229
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,510
You have power, because in today's economy
the only true power is information.

230
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,470
I want you to use that power.

231
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,890
I want you to get your boss
to pick BoJack as his Pegasus.

232
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,934
I always believed in you, Laura.

233
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,353
The question is:
do you believe in yourself?

234
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,064
Wow, that's--
I'm sorry, did you just make that up?

235
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,067
Because that was--
Is that a speech you had ready to go?

236
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,277
- Will you do this for me?
- Of course.

237
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,364
You went to bat for me when I tried
to get a promotion at Vigor.

238
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,826
I pushed so hard for you.
I did everything I could.

239
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,787
I mean, we gals gotta look out
for each other. Right?

240
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,996
Right.

241
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,499
[thunder cracks]

242
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,753
So you're talking about a merger?

243
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,673
Since my dad croaked
I've been running Vigor myself,

244
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,135
and I've been doing a pretty good job,
A-minus/B-plus.

245
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,930
But I could use a few more experienced
hands to help guide the ship,

246
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:07,476
- because being a boss is really hard.
- Yes.

247
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,729
Princess Carolyn can be a proud woman.
I'm glad you came to me first.

248
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,523
I would have gone to her directly,

249
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,776
but sometimes she yells at me
and I do not like being yelled at

250
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,863
and that is just something that people
need to understand about me.

251
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,157
I'll talk to her, when the time is right.

252
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,199
[groans]

253
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,993
[thunder]

254
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:29,957
So on the new show Ethan is the dad,
and he's raising three little horses.

255
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,126
You couldn't have told me
this over the phone?

256
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,545
This show is going to change my life.

257
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,673
I'm taking the kids out of school
and moving everyone down here.

258
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,217
I just had an offer accepted
on a house in Sherman Oaks.

259
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,012
As long as I don't change my mind
before the new year, boom.

260
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,472
Two million dollars, gone.

261
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,390
- The new year? That's tonight.
- I know.

262
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,476
Did you talk to my agent
by any chance?

263
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,810
- No.
- She didn't call you?

264
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,938
I talked to her, and I don't know
if she wants me to do it.

265
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,315
You know how agents are.

266
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,567
Just remember,
I'm not the bad guy here.

267
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,277
I hear you loud and clear.

268
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,404
Don't worry.
We won't take no for an answer.

269
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,491
I think my schedule's gonna be tough--
Might be going to New Zealand.

270
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,034
We'll work around your schedule.

271
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,411
Those bastards got my quote
so damn high.

272
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,830
We'll pay it.
No obstacle is insurmountable.

273
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,125
- As long as you want to do it.
- And I do want to do it.

274
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,502
Get me out of this thing.

275
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,379
This asshole's giving me everything
I ask for. What a nightmare.

276
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,841
- Tell him you don't want to do the show.
- I can't. It would destroy him.

277
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,010
Destroying people is what I pay you to do,

278
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,346
so I don't think about the people
I'm destroying.

279
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,431
Do you not know what an agent is?

280
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,017
- [knocking]
- [Ethan] BoJack, are you okay in there?

281
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,019
Is it number one or number two?

282
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,817
That cat's running circles around us.
What are we going to do?

283
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,904
Maybe we can distract her?
I'm thinking laser pointer.

284
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,115
If we're going to beat her,
we need to think like her.

285
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,869
Instead of convincing the <i>Pegasus</i>
people they don't want BoJack,

286
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,330
what if we convince BoJack
he doesn't want <i>Pegasus?</i>

287
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,916
Fantastic. How do we do that?

288
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,042
Kelsey.

289
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,504
Kelsey? That's what I said when
they said you wanted to meet with me.

290
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,256
I figured you never wanted
to see me again.

291
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,715
I never want to see anyone again,

292
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,344
but there's a book I've been trying
to turn into a movie and I need your help.

293
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,390
It's a coming-of-age story
about a girl who likes jellybeans.

294
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,100
The option expires tonight at midnight,

295
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,978
unless I can find a big enough star
to secure funding.

296
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,646
Frankly, I already gave up on it.

297
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,190
Then my agent said,
"Maybe BoJack's interested."

298
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,359
So the reason
you think I'm right for the role

299
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,444
is because I'm a big enough star
to secure funding?

300
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,030
Don't get smart, BoJack.
You're not good at it.

301
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,615
You're really giving the hard sell here.

302
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,202
I hear they've got you locked in
to some fantasy dystopia thing.

303
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,080
Are you just gonna do stupid bullshit
for the rest of your life?

304
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,748
For work or, like, in general?

305
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,459
I saw something in you,
something most people don't know you have,

306
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,170
and it kills me that instead
of sharing it with the world,

307
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,507
you want to hide it under some
wonderland unicorn nonsense.

308
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,010
It's a Pegasus. Unicorns are for babies.

309
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,178
The movie I want to make
isn't glamorous or sexy.

310
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,556
You don't get to be the big hero
everybody loves.

311
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,850
You get to be a guy
who works at a gas station,

312
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,269
who gets in a fight with his daughter
about jellybeans.

313
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,314
That's the whole movie.
It's small and it's real.

314
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,775
And you'd get to work
with a director who sees you.

315
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,778
And I can't sell it any better than that.

316
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,531
You're right, that one scene
we shot that didn't even make it

317
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,075
into the <i>Secretariat </i>movie
was the best thing I ever did.

318
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,620
Why am I wasting my time
with this other stuff?

319
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,204
- So you're in?
- Let's do it.

320
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,832
Great. How's your little friend
with the face?

321
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,209
Is he up to his old tricks,
getting into scrapes?

322
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,129
[laughs] What a little scamp.
Will you tell him I said hi?

323
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,636
Kelsey's movie sounds perfect.

324
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,640
Is it the nobody's-gonna-see-it element
or the fact you'll be working for peanuts?

325
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,393
This jellybean thing could show the world
that BoJack's more than just a movie star.

326
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,646
- He's an actor.
- Yeah, well, that's great,

327
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,315
but I've been working all day
on getting him the <i>Pegasus </i>movie

328
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,651
you said would show the world
he's a movie star.

329
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,570
I don't want that anymore.
I want to do something real.

330
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,989
You realize how much money
we'd be walking away from?

331
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,741
This isn't about money.
Doesn't matter to me.

332
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,827
- Yeah, it doesn't matter to you.
- Right. So what's the problem?

333
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,163
Maybe you can find a way
for BoJack to do both?

334
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,416
You're supposed to be
this amazing agent, after all.

335
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,251
I'll see what I can do.

336
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,216
New beers for the new year's?

337
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,344
We got a regular
Maya Angelou over here.

338
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,179
Good times.

339
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,306
- [cell phone rings]-
- Oh, it's Todd. Gotta take this.

340
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,934
- Maybe you can call him back later?
- Todd!

341
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,145
Don't be too long,
or I'm gonna drink all your beer.

342
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:24,483
[sighs]
Diane, do you ever look up at the stars

343
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,444
and feel like
they're tiny holes in the sky,

344
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,531
sucking out all the oxygen,
and suddenly you can't breathe

345
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:34,910
because you're thinking about how small
you are and how meaningless it all is?

346
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,287
Uh... I guess.

347
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,707
It's so cruel to let people love you.

348
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,586
All you're doing is promising
you'll one day break their hearts.

349
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,338
Cool fire pit.

350
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:53,721
So it turns out men love safe spaces
for women even more than women do.

351
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,182
You gotta read some of these comments.
Queefburglar69 says:

352
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,520
"These sexy lady chauffeurs
always get me where I need to go."

353
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,147
That's unambiguous.

354
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,483
The only problem is some of the drivers
have been complaining

355
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,110
about the new customer base.

356
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,239
The workers are allowed to complain?
We gotta tighten up that ship.

357
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,825
Most of the new passengers
are perfect gentlemen,

358
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,828
but we've found that a growing number
are rating our drivers

359
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:21,165
not on performance but on "bangability",

360
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:25,085
which creates an unfair advantage
for our "bangable" drivers

361
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,048
and creates what some
of our more homely employees

362
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:34,011
have dubbed a hostile sexy-ocracy.
Whoa!

363
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:38,098
Well, our first priority is creating
a safe space for women,

364
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,476
so if our women
don't feel safe in that space,

365
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,770
we should replace them
with women who do.

366
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:47,941
Where can we find women who are
comfortable around gentlemen?

367
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,277
I know. A gentleman's club.

368
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,403
That's perfect.

369
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,197
To Whale World.

370
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,159
Well, you didn't hear it from me,

371
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,453
but I pulled some strings and you're in.

372
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,246
I always knew you were a superstar.

373
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,790
Let's get drinks in the new year

374
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,209
and work out the deets--
That's a fast way of saying details

375
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,462
for people who don't have time
for every detail of the word details.

376
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,880
Vanessa Gekko on line two.

377
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,882
Great, put that raggedy-ass bitch on.

378
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,343
I'm gonna bat her around
like a ball of foil.

379
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,097
I know you're excited, but we are still
in a very precarious position,

380
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,600
and I wonder if foil-ball-batting
is the best tack here.

381
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,603
Judah, this is where I live.
Watch and learn.

382
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:28,357
Hey, we heard BoJack and Kelsey
had a great meeting on <i>Jelly Belle.</i>

383
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,734
Gotta tie this up tonight
if it's going to happen.

384
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,444
BoJack would love to do the movie,

385
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,280
but you're gonna have to work
around his <i>Pegasus</i> schedule.

386
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,825
Oh, um... That might be tricky.

387
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,952
Then you're gonna have to match
his <i>Pegasus </i>quote.

388
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,122
- He won't do it for a penny less.
- Princess Carolyn--

389
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,375
Even with a star like BoJack,
Kelsey can't get that kind of money.

390
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,001
Well, then, work around his schedule.

391
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,588
You're overplaying your hand, PC,
and I'm calling your bluff.

392
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,134
I'm barreling towards you fast, Gekko,
and this Mack truck ain't gonna blink.

393
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,137
That's not fair. I was clearly
establishing a poker metaphor,

394
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,264
you just changed it to a game of chicken.

395
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,640
My court. My rules.

396
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,684
Court? What game are you playing?

397
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,977
Bye.

398
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,854
- Damn it!
- Question:

399
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,940
Am I the faulty bike tire pump
I had in seventh grade?

400
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,693
Because I just blew this thing wide open.

401
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,237
- Talk to me, soldier.
- I have been scouring old emails.

402
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,240
I didn't know what I was looking for.
I knew there was something.

403
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,576
And I found it. Bam!

404
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:25,205
[gasps] Hot shit on a ham sandwich,
this is amazing!

405
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,206
[ringtone]

406
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,585
Sweet crap on a croissant,
Katie's going into labor!

407
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,838
Go, I'll take care of this.
Family comes first.

408
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,090
Thank you. You make me stronger.

409
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,302
[dance music plays]

410
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,222
Why is my house filled with sexy orcas?

411
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:46,768
It's the Cabracadabra New Year's party.
These are our drivers.

412
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,687
Oh. Uh, where's Emily?

413
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,773
She left.
She said she didn't feel comfortable here.

414
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,152
She certainly didn't feel comfortable
paying for the food she ate.

415
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,113
Yeah, okay, BoJack.

416
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,489
[doorbell rings]

417
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,869
I got champagne for my real friends,
'cause that's what you are.

418
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,996
- A real friend.
- He doesn't want to do your show.

419
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,040
- What?
- BoJack is about to win an Oscar.

420
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,584
Why do you think he would want
to do your soon-to-fail sitcom

421
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,462
about the further adventures
of a carb-faced nobody?

422
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,923
- Oh, maybe--
- You are not a television star.

423
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:20,135
You have no talent and I am forgetting
your face even as I'm looking at it.

424
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,054
Pack your bags.
Go back to Nowheresville.

425
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:26,516
Thank you for the champagne.
Best regards, Ana Spanakopita.

426
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,189
Oh, God, the house!
I gotta pull my deposit! Pick up--

427
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,650
Oh, no. I dropped my phone in a bog.

428
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,280
Something is going on with your brother.
You need to talk to him.

429
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,659
We don't really have the kind of
relationship where we talk about things.

430
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,410
Labs prefer to keep things playful.

431
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,997
You know what they say about dogs?
Talking to each other is rrruff.

432
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,749
I'm serious, Mr. Peanutbutter.

433
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,835
And I'm serious that you should drop it.

434
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,421
If something was really wrong,
he would tell me about it.

435
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,339
Would he?

436
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,800
I know he's your brother,
but he's hiding something from you.

437
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,177
Why do you think you know my brother
better than I do?

438
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,596
Just because you have a shitty
relationship with your family

439
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,557
doesn't mean every other family
has to have drama too.

440
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,476
I wanted to come up here
and have a nice time.

441
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,103
This place is an escape for me.

442
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:14,064
- Okay, I'm sorry, I just--
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

443
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,733
I should not have shouted at you.
I just...

444
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,860
I need to go for a walk.

445
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:27,452
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, is there something going on?

446
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,956
Because I know there isn't,
but if there is, you would tell me, right?

447
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,541
But there's nothing to tell,

448
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,419
because nothing bad ever happens
on the Labrador Peninsula.

449
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,297
- Okay, I think you should sit down.
- Why?

450
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,091
- I need to talk to you. Sit down.
- I will not sit down.

451
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,343
- Mr. Peanutbutter, sit.
- Okay.

452
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,139
- I got a twisted spleen.
- No.

453
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,017
It's not fatal, necessarily.
Everything's gonna be fine.

454
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,935
They still have to run some tests.

455
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,313
- But it's going to be fine?
- Yeah.

456
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,732
Promise me it's going to be fine?
You're my big brother.

457
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,859
That means you can't lie to me about this.

458
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:03,196
Mr. Peanutbutter, you are the best
runt of the litter a guy could ask for.

459
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,448
No, don't do this.

460
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,908
- But there might come a time...
- Please.

461
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,037
...when you're going
to have to be the captain.

462
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,872
[sighs]

463
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,458
What is this, a very special episode?

464
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,585
[both laugh]

465
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,008
[both howl]

466
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,802
[howling continues]

467
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,683
What? What do you mean?
What happened?

468
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,935
It's a no-go on BoJack for <i>Pegasus.</i>

469
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,479
<i>I don't understand, Laura. I...</i>

470
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,940
I just wanted you to know.
I did everything I could.

471
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,697
- Hey.
- [Kelsey] <i>Look...</i>

472
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,950
If you didn't wanna do my movie,
you should have just told me.

473
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,744
I do want to do your movie.

474
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,288
Oh, yeah? Why did your agent
keep demanding more money?

475
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,916
<i>- What?</i>
- The option's expired and I'm screwed.

476
00:22:55,999 --> 00:23:00,462
Ugh! Why did I get my hopes up?
Why do I keep letting you get my hopes up?

477
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,713
Kelsey, this is a mistake.

478
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,466
It's a mistake I keep making.
Next time, BoJack?

479
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,052
Do a girl a favor,
don't break her heart by inches.

480
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,888
Do it all at once.
It'll save everyone some time.

481
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,306
Huh?

482
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,434
[crowd] Ten, nine, eight...

483
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,813
Oh, good, you're still here.

484
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,482
I wanted to get a head start
on the 2016 budget.

485
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,776
It'll be a challenge, but assuming
BoJack books <i>Pegasus--</i>

486
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,611
BoJack didn't book <i>Pegasus.</i>

487
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,697
- So he's doing the jellybean movie?
- That fell apart, too.

488
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,491
We're gonna have to cut some costs.

489
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,410
Our social media division
is a luxury we can no longer afford.

490
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,831
If things don't perk up the first quarter,
we might be looking at broader layoffs.

491
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,417
- Do you ever read a room?
- I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

492
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,879
Is midnight on New Year's a bad time?
I don't know.

493
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,423
Why don't you run that through
your robot analysis protocol?

494
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,509
Get back to me
once you've assessed the data.

495
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,970
I am not a robot. I am a human being.

496
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,014
You want to make some cuts?
Why don't you cut that stupid beard?

497
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,268
Everyone who walks in here thinks
this place is run by a homeless person.

498
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,437
I apologize if my appearance
or demeanor is unprofessional.

499
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:04,818
[sighs] No, you're perfect.
Everybody's perfect except for me.

500
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,986
Go home, Judah.

501
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,156
- Would you like me to shave the beard?
- Just go home, Judah.

502
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,868
Happy New Year, Princess Carolyn.

503

00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,791

[whimpers]

506
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:35,015
Hello, little ones. Mama loves you.

507
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,434
And you. And you. And you.

508
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,520
- They're so beautiful.
- And you, and you, and you.

509
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,522
- Rutabaga, we got it.
- Yeah?

510
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:46,693
Chuff Hollister is the new Pegasus.
We saved the agency.

511
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,197
- That's incredible, honey.
- Wow, everything worked out.

512
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,824
You gotta love a happy ending.
