<i>Get breakfast, you stupid fat-ass.</i>

00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,651
<i>These are cookies. This is not breakfast.</i>

<i>You are eating cookies. Stop it.</i>

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,113
<i>Stop eating cookies,</i>

11
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>Stop it. Don't eat one more cookie.</i>

12
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,450

00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,079
-Hey, BoJack, we need milk.
-For the baby.

15
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,998
-For the what?
-Where is the baby? I saw...

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,458
-Can I borrow your car?
-What baby?

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,251
I don't know.
Tina's gonna make breakfast.

18
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,170
She needs milk.
Can I take the car or what?

19
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,297
[thinking] <i>Shit.</i>
<i>I don't want her driving my car,</i>

20
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,590

21
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,009
<i>She's not grubby, she's your daughter,</i>

22
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,595
<i>You're a piece of garbage,</i>

25

<i>and her spooky lazy eyes.</i>

26
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,685
<i>If you get the milk</i>
<i>and leave Hollyhock with Mom,</i>

27
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,062
<i>she could tell things about you,</i>

28
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,064

32
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,779

If it isn't my favorite client,
Courtney Portnoy,

and also another client, Todd.

88
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,062
It's always nice to be included
in a sentence someone says.

89
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,565
So bad news first: <i>Ms. Taken</i>
was a miserable failure.

-Princess Carolyn--
-But Courtney, more importantly,

91
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,029
audiences are going to adore
your tour de force performance

00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,450
as the forceful denim-clad court reporter
in <i>The Court Reporter Sported Jorts,</i>

93
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,537
the jet-setting jort-sporting
court reporter story.

94
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,790
Yes, the film is spectacularly romantic
and well-titled,

95
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,625
but I need a change in representation.

96
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,794
No! Courtney! Before you fire me--

97
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:59,507
I'm not gonna fire you.
Heavens, no! I fired my agents.

98
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,468
Oh, good. Yeah, agents are replaceable.

99
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,179
A manager is forever.
That's the takeaway here.

100
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,807
I think you'll fall in love
with my new agent.

101
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,018
-Love her already. Who is she?
-He.

102
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,936
Yes, he, he, ha, ha.
[chuckles]

103

-Now tell me her name.
-Rutabaga Rabitowitz.

00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,982
Oh, fish.

105
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,027
{\an8}We got a nice bounce
off of Court's engagement.

106
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,863
{\an8}"Court" is what I'm calling Courtney
for wordplay-related reasons

107
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,990
{\an8}that'll become apparent
at the end of this sentence,

108
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,451
but that bounce has lost its pounce,

109
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,494
and if we want to keep
this name in the news,

110
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,205
we're going to need a full-<i>court</i> press.

111
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,418
{\an8}So what do you do after an engagement?

112
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,171
{\an8}D-d-d-doy!
Wedding of the century.

113
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,088
{\an8}Whoa!

114
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,675
{\an8}We're talking floral arrangements.
We're talking procession of elephants.

115
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,012
{\an8}We're talking Jaden Smith
in a <i>Clockwork Orange</i> costume,

116
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,805
reading a poem he wrote...

117
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,516
Does that poem rhyme? No!
What are you, crazy? Of course it doesn't.

118
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,227
{\an8}And, uh-oh, was someone looking
for Sebastian Janikowski,

119
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,604
{\an8}because here's the kicker--

120
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,524
{\an8}we do the whole thing the weekend
before the movie drops. Bam!

121
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,109
{\an8}-Weekend before the movie drops?
-Boom!

122
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,652
{\an8}-That's this weekend.
-Ka-zow!

123
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,321
{\an8}-Four days from today.
-Ooh.

124
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,864
Today? That's today!

125
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,367
Which is why it's so perfect.
No notice is the new notice.

126
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,245
{\an8}This wedding is so fancy
we don't care if you have other plans.

127
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,372
-Total status move.
-You're right.

128
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,124
Being engaged is one thing,

129
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,794
but I'm not sure
I want to actually get married.

130
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,130
{\an8}We can draw up a standard
Hollywoo sham-marriage contract:

131
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,258
{\an8}-three years, non-exclusive, huge payday.
-Oh.

132
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,302
And I presume
you'll be arranging everything.

133
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,764
As Courtney's agent I'm happy to help,
but I believe traditionally

134
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,391
it's the bride's manager
who plans the wedding.

135
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,352
[groans] Okay.

136
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,023

137
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,192
[Bea] You are just the prettiest thing.

138
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,861
-Yes, you are.
-Who are you talking to?

139
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,115
Keep it down, oaf.
You'll make the baby cry.

140
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,074
-Baby?
-Yes, you are.

141
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,577
She kept asking where the baby was,
so I had Tina get her this doll.

142
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,081
-She's totes into it.
-Mom is "totes" into a baby?

143
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,500
Is it possible the baby
got dipped in brandy at some point?

144
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,836
Or cigarettes, or regressive ideas
about immigrants?

145
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,880
-I think she just wanted a baby.
-Coochie-coochie-coo...

146
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,133
You shouldn't indulge her delusions.
It's not right.

147
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,511
But she seemed really down.
And you're never around anymore.

148
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,263
It was getting depressing to look at her.

149
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,348
That's why I made her this pillowcase.

150
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,309
You just put this over her head
and everything is fine.

151
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,686
-[groans]
-[Bea] Dark in here.

-Hello?

153
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,734
So they're airing an <i>F.H.B.A. Miami</i>
marathon this weekend.

154
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,236
Does anyone want to come over?

155
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,322
Oh, I actually have a big announcement.

156
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,534
I'm marrying Courtney Portnoy
this weekend.

157
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,786
-Wow! Great, Todd. Good for you.
-That's amazing.

158
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,665
I know it's pretty wild for an asexual
to get married, but...

159
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,418
Not really. John and I are aces
and we're married.

160
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,461
-Really?
-Yeah.

161
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,795
Our wedding was nautical-themed.

162
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,256
Why nautical?
Is that, like, an asexual thing?

163
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,216
No, man. We just really like boats.

164
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,886
Asexual just means
you're not interested in sex.

165
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,388
Some asexuals are also a-romantic,

166
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,974
but others have relationships
like anyone else.

167
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,851
But involving boats?

168
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,479
I feel like you're getting really hung up
on the boats thing.

169
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,482
So, it's not weird
for an ace to get married?

170
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:06,652
No, if you found someone who really
accepts you for who you are, go for it.

171
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,740
I will! I mean, I am. I mean, am I?

172
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,537
<i>♪ Beautiful eggs of '44 ♪</i>

173
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,123
<i>♪ For my baby, want some more ♪</i>

174
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,293
Mmm! Beatrice, this coffee is amazing.

175
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,419
[groans]

176
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,713
[thinking] <i>You stupid garbage fire.</i>
<i>Everything sucks.</i>

177
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,174
BoJack, did you see
what your mother is doing?

178
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,550
Isn't it incredible?

179
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,220
Yeah, making breakfast
at three in the afternoon. So with it.

180
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:36,265
Isn't this baby well-behaved?
Hardly ever cries.

181
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,726
Probably because you're such
a good mother, Beatrice.

182
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,810
Don't say that.

183
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,104
I was very nervous
to have a baby in the house,

184
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,358
but it turns out,
all it needed is a mother's love.

185
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,488
Oh, when you grow up,
you can be anything you want to be.

186
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,491
[thinking] <i>Lousy baby.</i>
<i>What did it ever do that was so great?</i>

187
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,909
<i>Am I jealous of a doll?</i>

188
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,746
<i>Maybe if that doll wasn't so smug,</i>
<i>looking at me with its creepy doll eyes...</i>

189
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,997
She's tricking you, Hollyhock.

190
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,458
-This is not what she's really like.
-Who cares?

191
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,045
Whatever beef you have with your mom,
that's just a sweet confused old lady.

192
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,172
-[thinking] <i>She's right.</i>
-Wrong. She's in there.

193
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,050
-She knows exactly what she's doing.
-You are so paranoid.

194
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,178
Please stop fighting.
All this shouting is bad for the baby.

195
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,973
Where was that keen parenting insight
50 years ago?

196
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,017
[gasps] Henrietta,
you're unfit to be a parent.

197
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,769
-I'm unfit?
-[thinking] <i>It's true, jackass.</i>

198
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,897
You think it's so hard
to be a parent to a doll? I could do that.

199
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,984
Hey, look, I'm cradling the baby.
Hope I don't drop it!

200
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,110
[gasps]

201
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,862
Oh, no! I dropped it, but it's not crying.

202
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,365
Guess it's okay. I'm an amazing parent.

203
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,535
What if I left it in its room all day
and didn't feed it or change it?

204
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,621
Oh, that's okay, too.
I must be mother of the year!

205
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,665
-BoJack.
-I know! What if for 18 years straight

206
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,168
I just tell it how worthless it is
every day, how it embarrasses me,

207
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,212
how my life would be better
if it was never born?

208
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,423
Would that be a good idea?
Probably, right?

209
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,552
Give me the baby back, you worthless waste
of my husband's jism!

210
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:58,097
-Oh, so you <i>do </i>know who I am.
-Govern yourself, Henrietta.

211
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,350
Hey, you think the baby would be okay
if I threw it over the side of my deck?

212
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,810
-Probably, right?
-[Bea gasps]

213
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,312
BoJack, don't.

214
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,479
[thinking] <i>Do it.</i>

215
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,107
Nah, I'm just kidding around.
Here you go, Mom.

216
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,735
Oh, no! My hands are so slippery!

217
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,445
Oh, no! Oh, oh, oh!

218
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,116
No!

219
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,368
[thinking] <i>Nice arm.</i>

220
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,705
-[sobbing]
-Why did you do that?

221
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,753
-[growling]
<i>-You goddamn piece of shit idiot asshole.</i>

222
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,715
<i>This is what you do.</i>
<i>This is what you always do.</i>

223
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,135
<i>This is why Mom loves Doll more than you.</i>
<i>She's right. Doll never hurt anybody.</i>

224
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,304
<i>Doll wouldn't throw you</i>
<i>over the side of a mountain.</i>

225
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,723
<i>Gotta make things right.</i>
<i>Gotta get Doll back.</i>

226
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,934
<i>Okay, one drink. And then, Doll back.</i>

227
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,604
<i>You screw-up.</i>
<i>You're making your daughter hate you.</i>

228
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,106
<i>Which is good, because look what happens</i>
<i>when people love you.</i>

229
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,567
<i>Look at Penny. And Herb. And Sarah Lynn.</i>

230
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,278
<i>It's because you made them love you,</i>
<i>BoJack.</i>

231
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,614
<i>You gotta fix this, dummy.</i>
<i>How can you fix this?</i>

232
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,240
<i>Princess Carolyn?</i>
<i>She hates your guts.</i>

233
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,117
<i>Todd? No.</i>
<i>Diane? Yes! Oh, good.</i>

234
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,620
<i>Good old responsible Diane,</i>
<i>she'll know what to do.</i>

235
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,163
Oh... aah...

236
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,416
-[groaning]
-Oh.

237
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,418
"California can't wait."

238
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,087
Am I Ace of Base right now?

239
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,131
Because all that I want
is another one of these babies.

240
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,633
BoJack Horseman?

241
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,761
What is this, a will.i.am-style
celebrity endorsement video?

242
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,638
-Where's Diane?
-Oh, she's on the roof.

243
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,557
Boy, will she be surprised
to see you. Diane!

244
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,892
[thinking] <i>What are you doing?</i>

245
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,977
No, not like this.
She doesn't know I'm here.

246
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,355
First time she sees me
can't be drunk asking for help.

247
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,940
-What's wrong? You need help?
-<i>Idiot.</i>

248
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,858
You gotta get me outta here.
Where did I park?

249
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,068
-Um...
-Beep. Beep, beep?

250
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,653
You shouldn't be driving right now.

251
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,406
Why don't I make like Eddie Money
and take you home tonight?

252
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,117
No, I can't go home. Not without Doll.

253
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,078
Also, Eddie Money doesn't do
the taking home in "Take Me Home Tonight,"

254
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,581
so if you're taking me home,
then I would be Eddie Money.

255
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,834
Okay, something's going on with you.

256
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,961
-It's not like you to be so testy.
-Yes, it is.

257
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,255
Everyone, take the rest of the day off.

258
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:58,384
My pal BoJack needs a friend day.
California can wait!

259
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,138
Elton, you <i>have</i> to play this wedding.

260
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,765
We want one of those <i>Stranger Things</i>
kids to be the ring-bearer.

261
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,850
They're still little?

262
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,602
You're gonna do a duet
with a hologram of Nat King Cole.

263
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,355
Or, if that's cost-prohibitive,
Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes.

264
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,190
Puberty?
Can we give them something for that?

265
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,025
-Great.
-Fabulous.

266
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,360
We are killing this.

267
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,363
We are doing to this wedding
what Rob Durst did to that lady

268
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,158
-and what Fred Durst did to his career.
-[door opens]

269
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,827
I have terrible news. It's Meryl Streep.

270
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,413
-[both gasp]
-Did Meryl Streep die?

271
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,998
No, she's retiring.

272
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,166
Mr. McGregor!

273
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,878
You cannot just walk into a room and say,
"I have terrible news about Meryl Streep."

274
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,172
Her retirement party
is scheduled for this Saturday.

275
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,840
All of Hollywoo will be attending.

276
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,633
This Saturday? No, no, no!

277
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,344
How is #TortneyChortnoy
supposed to compete with that?

278
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,429
We're toast.

279
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,475
Unless, uh, we could somehow get Meryl
to postpone her party?

280
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:51,395
Hmm... what if we put together
a project so enticing

281
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,063
she couldn't help but climb aboard?

282
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,609
-One more gig...
-Means no more retirement.

283
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,612
But what could we possibly offer her
that she hasn't already done?

284
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,991
-Ah. What does every actor want to do?
-Direct.

285
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,284
-Direct!
-Yeah.

286
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,204
But the dream of any director
is to work with Meryl Streep.

287
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,499
You think Meryl wants to direct
a bunch of actors who aren't Meryl Streep?

288
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,876
-Hah! What a nightmare!
-Okay, all right. Okay, fine.

289
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,336
But, okay, okay, and this...

290
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,340
What if all the actors in the movie
<i>were </i>Meryl Streep?

291
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,134
-What? No!
-Are you suggesting some sort of

292
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,428
<i>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</i>
type situation

293
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,180
where Meryl Streep plays every role?

294
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,558
Bingo-bongo, weirdo-beardo.
All the greats have done it.

295
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,811
Peter Sellers, Sir Alec Guinness,
Flo from the Progressive ads.

296
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,605
Let's take this to the Streep.

297
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,027
Hey, look. Maybe this is a baby?

298
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,529
-Mmm.
-[door opens]

299
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,113
-Welcome...
-Hey, hey!

300
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,450
...to the nightmare, non-sexy version of
<i>Three's Company </i>that my life has become.

301
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,995
Oh, good. Instead of getting
the doll back, like you said you would,

302
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,748
you disappeared for a few hours
and found a friend.

303
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,542
For your information, we are on the case.

304
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,669
Just need a whiff of your mom
to track the scent.

305
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,713
Uh, excuse me, young lady,
I'm looking for a Beatrice,

306
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,092
but you're way too young and attractive
to be that mean old crone.

307
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,677
-What?
-What are you doing?

308
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,556
[sniffing] Okay, I'm picking up
on some fruity overtones.

309
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,434
Oak, desert sage... [chuckles]
No, I'm just kidding around.

310
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,686
It's smelling humor.

311
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,272
Is this the best time
to be workshopping your tight five?

312
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,899
[sniffing] Okay, got it.
Ooh, this way?

313
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,110
[sniffing] No! No, no. That way!

314
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,195
-[glasses clattering]
-[sniffing]

315
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,240
Out the door! Come on! Here we go!

316
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,741
-[groans]
-[door opens, shuts]

318
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,542
[thinking] <i>Look at him. Not a care</i>
<i>in the world. How does he do it?</i>

319
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,003
[sniffs] This is the place.

320
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,921
[doorbell rings]

321
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,883
-Oh, hi, I'm--
-BoJack Horseman.

322
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,010
-Felicity Huffman?
-Looking for this?

323
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,970
-Yes!
-Well, keep looking, buddy!

324
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,639
You're a real piece of shit,
you know that?

325
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,766
Yes.

326
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,603
[grunting]

327
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,441
So, instead of talking
through your issues,

328
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,152
your new thing
is to just get in really big fights

329
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,029
and then have hot angry sex?

330
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,032
-Yeah, but it kind of works.
-Does it?

331
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,534
I'm sorry,
I feel like we always talk about me.

332
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,119
What's going on with you, Roxie?

333
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:15,289
-I'm actually glad you asked, I...
-[grunts] Okay.

334
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,791
Hey, Diane, can I get your advice
on something?

335
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,752
-Yeah, of course. I'm not doing anything.
-Um...

336
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,546
So, I have this friend,

337
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,800
and his name
is Darnarius McQuimberton.

338
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,969
Oh, yeah,
I think I read an article about him

339
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,513
in <i>Real, Not Made-Up, Person Magazine.</i>

340
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,767
Darnarius is supposed to get married
this weekend.

341
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,979
And it's going to be an amazing wedding,
but it's kind of based on a lie.

342
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,481
Should he go through with it?

343
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,943
Well, all weddings are lies, right?
Sort of.

344
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,861
You're making this big declaration

345
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,405
about how you're gonna stay
with this person forever,

346
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,949
but you don't actually know that.

347
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,701
You're just saying it.
The whole thing is a farce.

348
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,664
-Yeah, that's true.
-But it's a lie based on truth.

349
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,415
Like, at the center of the farce

350
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,085
there's this nugget
of something real and pure.

351
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,004
And that strange beautiful something

352
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,423
is why you put up
with everything else, right?

353
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,508
I guess so.

354
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,553
And sometimes it's hard to remember
that pure, shining thing

355
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,598
because it's been painted over
with so many arguments

356
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,142
and compromises and disappointments.

357
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,270
But you have to believe
it's still down there somewhere,

358
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,939
even if you can't see it.

359
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:26,235
And maybe even the belief in it
is more important than the thing itself,

360
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,946
but only as long as you still believe it.

361
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,241
-Does that make sense?
-Yeah. Thanks, Diane.

362
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:36,412
You've given me
and Darquimbertus McNarington

363
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,080
a lot to think about.

364
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,545
That was good advice.
I'm, like, a really good friend.

365
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,505
[groans]

366
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,715
[doorbell rings]

367
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,842
-What?
-Okay.

368
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:53,387
So that doll actually belongs to my mom.
She's very sick, very frail.

369
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,597
And I know you're really mad at me
because...

370
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,225
<i>Think, shit-for-brains, think.</i>
<i>Why is Felicity Huffman mad at you?</i>

371
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,644
<i>You cut her off in traffic,</i>
<i>got her fired off a project,</i>

372
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,689
<i>talked shit about her at an AIDS benefit</i>
<i>and didn't realize your mic was on.</i>

373
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,776
I have been living directly under
your house for the last 15 years.

374
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,572
Do you have any idea how much shit
you throw over the side of your deck?

375
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:15,534
Beer bottles, lit cigarettes,
scripts where the lead is female.

376
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,370
One time, a mountain
of regurgitated cotton candy

377
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,750
sat on that hill for a month
before sliding into my hot tub.

378
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,293
Who you think has to deal with that?

379
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,337
I assume your maid
or gardener or something?

380
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,591
Well, yeah.
But it's still super-obnoxious.

381
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,259
You're not getting that doll back.

382
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,427
Citizens, citizens.

383
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,471
As the future governor of California,

384
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,058
I pride myself on probably being able
to reach compromises

385
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,976
across the ideological spectrum.

386
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,520
-Oh! What if we cut the baby in half?
-What?

387
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,730
-Why would we do that?
-No.

388
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,523
So you both agree that's a bad idea.

389
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,942
Perhaps you're not so different after all?

390
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,320
-Advantage: Peanutbutter.
-How is that...?

391
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,948
Felicity Huffman, you are a beloved star
of film and television.

392
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:59,119
BoJack, you have also
appeared in film and television.

393
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,330
What's that like? Discuss.

394
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,291
I'm sorry for my acquaintance.
I'm actually a big fan.

395
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,335
[thinking]<i> I hope</i>
<i>she has no follow-up questions.</i>

396
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,545
Really? So you've probably
seen my new show,

397
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,506
<i>-F.H.B.A. Los Angeles.</i>
-[thinking] <i>What?</i>

398
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,509
-Yup, love it.
-How'd you like to do an arc for sweeps?

399
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,053
[thinking] <i>Ugh, TV? No.</i>
<i>I just got out of that sinkhole.</i>

400
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,889
He'll do it, if you give us our doll back.

401
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,225
Hup... ho... hup!

402
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,684
[Princess Carolyn] <i>What's your status?</i>

403
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,394
I have breached Compound Streep.

404
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,439
If I don't make it out of this alive,
just know I have already seen heaven

405
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,108
and it is Meryl's rose garden.

406
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,151
-And the offer?
-I put it under a big box

407
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,444
that's propped up by a stick.

408
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,363
If she goes to look
and the box falls on her,

409
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,490
she's contractually obligated
to do the movie.

410
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,700
Yeah, I know what
"packaging talent" means.

411
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,119
Okay, she's walking up to the box.

412
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,288
She's sniffing around, and...

413
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,333
-[box slides, woman screams]
-We got Meryl!

414
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,293
All right! Yes!

415
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,338
[thinking] <i>What if I throw myself</i>
<i>off my deck</i>

416
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,798
<i>into Felicity Huffman's backyard.</i>

417
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,259
<i>If she found my dead body,</i>
<i>that'd show her.</i>

418
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,510
Why are we at a bar?

419
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,512
We're just celebrating getting Doll back.

420
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,723
You don't want to bring the doll back
to your mom?

421
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,392
I will. We're just having a drink first.

422
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,018
-Relax.
-Okay.

423
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,812
[thinking] <i>He knows you're terrible.</i>

424
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,481
<i>He's the biggest idiot in the world,</i>
<i>even he knows you're terrible.</i>

425
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,276
So when did you get a daughter?
She's new, right?

426
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,654
-Or was she always part of the gang?
-I met her about a month ago.

427
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,115
-Whoa!
-Yeah. And it was great, at first.

428
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,908
But now I can feel her getting attached,

429
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,743
and I just know
I'm gonna BoJack things up.

430
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,078
"BoJack things up?"

431
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,873
You mean, show up somewhere
and be the life of the party?

432
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,292
Then share a laugh
with your good friend, Mr. Peanutbutter?

433
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,003
No, obviously I meant screw everything up
until she hates me.

434
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,462
I don't think I can take that.

435
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,716
Maybe this time, don't do the thing
that makes her hate you.

436
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,051
I don't want to,
but every time she looks at me

437
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,678
with those big innocent eyes,

438
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,097
all I can think about
is every shitty thing I've ever done,

439
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,349
and I think,
"I don't deserve that kind of love."

440
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,352
Look, BoJack, I don't know a lot
about balancing a state budget

441
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,354
-or how a bill becomes a law.
-Uh...

442
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,398
I don't know a lot about a lot of things.

443
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:55,194
But I do know this:
everybody deserves to be loved.

444
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,113
[clinking]

445
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:03,035
So we put together an all-star wedding
and a Meryl Streep movie in one day!

446
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,662
-You got to admit, we're a good team.
-Rutabaga...

447
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,832
I know it wasn't always smooth sailing
for the Good Ship You and Me,

448
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,168
but now you've got a boyfriend
and I've got a family,

449
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,504
and since we have to work together again,
we're a good team.

450
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,340
Tell me you didn't miss this.

451
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,926
-Todd is on line two.
-Aaah! Do you go <i>through </i>the walls?

452
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,637
Todd! Have you finished
your groomsmen list?

453
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,889
We gotta figure out
how many parachutes we need.

454
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,100
Uh, guys, I-- I can't marry Courtney.

455
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,560
-What?
-No!

456
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,648
I've been doing some thinking,
and marriage is like a Tootsie Pop.

457
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,983
The lollipop part is a lie,

458
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,819
<i>but at the center of the lie</i>
<i>there's a truth.</i>

459
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,031
That's the Tootsie Roll,
and that's why people get married.

460
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:45,285
But if I married Courtney
it would be a lie without any truth in it,

461
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,914
like a Tootsie Pop
with just the lollipop part

462
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,791
and nothing in the middle.

463
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,336
So, a lollipop? That's still pretty good.

464
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,879
[Todd] <i>I guess it's a bad analogy.</i>

465
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,589
But I don't want a fake marriage.

466
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,008
I'm sorry I didn't realize that before.

467
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,262
[sighs] Okay, Todd.
You gotta do what's right for you.

468
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,597
<i>Thanks, Princess Carolyn.</i>
<i>Whoa--</i>

469
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,723
[groans]

470
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:11,103
All right, blue sky time. Wedding's off.
Can we spin this somehow?

471
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,188
Courtney got jilted,
play the sympathy card?

472
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,065
I guess we could put out a statement.

473
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,191
That's your solution?

474
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,819
What happened to the guy
from this morning with all the big ideas?

475
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,863
Oh, that guy dies at six.
This guy's gotta get home.

476
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,992
I got seven kids and a wife
who's really into me co-parenting,

477
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,868
or, as she calls it, "parenting."

478
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,205
Well, can't you tuck the kids into bed,
read them some script coverage

479
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,791
of the film adaptation of <i>Good Night Moon</i>
and then come back?

480
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,711
-This is important.
-Well, my kids are important.

481
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,587
Fine, both things are equally important.

482
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,840
Oh, my God, thank God you're not a mother.

483
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,217
You would be hilarious at it.
[sips]

484
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,387
Hey, today was fun.
I'll call you in the morning.

485
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,306
We'll figure this out. We'll deal with it.

486
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,808
-[door opens]
-[sighs]

487
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,936
If you'd like to never see him again,
I have ways of getting rid of him.

488
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,563
What kind of ways?

489
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,983
Asking him politely to not come back.
Actually, that's only one way.

490
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,235
I apologize for misleading you
about the number of ways.

491
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,112
He's a jerk, right? It's not just me?

492
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,780
I worked with guys like him at F.M.E.

493
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,533
When I left, I swore
I would never work at a big agency again,

494
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,994
because I can't work
with people like that.

495
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,245
You don't think I'm like that?

496
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,831
No, because you care about people
other than yourself.

497
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,709
And for what it's worth,
you will be a wonderful mother.

498
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,420
-You're not just saying that?
-I never just say anything.

499
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,713
I choose words very carefully,

500
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,965
with an eye towards precision
and expediency.

501
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,717
I'm surprised you haven't noticed that.

502
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,011
-Good night, Judah.
-Mm-hmm.

503
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,306
[door closes]

504
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,774
[muffled grunts and yells]

505
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,405
Okay. [chuckles]

506
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,784
-It's about time, Henrietta.
-You're welcome.

507
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,118
[growls]

508
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,126
[thinking] <i>Go talk to her, idiot.</i>

509
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,921
<i>Drink first. No, you stupid alcoholic.</i>

510
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,590
<i>Talk to your daughter. You're ruining her.</i>
<i>You know that, right?</i>

511
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,467
<i>No matter what,</i>
<i>your poison is already in her.</i>

512
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,344
<i>There's nothing you can do.</i>
<i>That's not true.</i>

513
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,929
<i>Yeah, it is, you stupid piece of shit.</i>

514
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,766
<i>You're a real stupid piece of shit,</i>
<i>and everywhere you go you destroy people.</i>

515
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,392
<i>Your mother never loved you.</i>

516
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,645
<i>That's why Sarah Lynn died,</i>
<i>Charlotte'll never forgive you.</i>

517
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,439
<i>What you gonna do to Hollyhock?</i>
<i>What you gonna do, asshole? Shut up!</i>

518
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,025
[exhales]

519
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,408
Got Doll back. No big deal.

520
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,829
Where do you go,
when you disappear all day?

521
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,333
Just drive around.
Sometimes I go to a bar.

522
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,460
Sometimes I pull over
by the side of the road,

523
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,504
just sit there for hours.

524
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,588
Why?

525
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,592
And you'd rather do that

526
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,678
-than spend time with me?
-Hollyhock...

527
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,264
I know you didn't ask
for this dorky 17-year-old

528
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,682
to just show up at your door.

529
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,725
And I'm sorry if I'm annoying,
but I didn't ask...

530
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,186
-No, Hollyhock, I'm glad you're here.
-Oh.

531
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,772
If I'm shitty,
that's just because I'm shitty.

532
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,775
You're allowed to be mad at me,
but you need to know that whatever I do,

533
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,277
it's not your fault.

534
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:12,284
I know. I mean, I know,
but I don't always know, you know?

535
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,412
Like, sometimes I have this tiny voice
in the back of my head that goes, like,

536
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,915
"Hey, everyone hates you!
And they're not wrong to feel that way!"

537
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,042
I know what you mean.

538
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:25,547
That voice, the one that tells you
you're worthless and stupid and ugly?

539
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,341
-Yeah?
-It goes away, right?

540
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:32,053
It's just, like, a dumb teenage-girl
thing, but then it goes away?

541
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,389
Yeah.
