172
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,806
<i>♪ Work it ♪</i>

173
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,392
Sarah Lynn, I know things
got kind of out of hand

174
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,353
last time when I tried to
make you stop doing drugs.

175
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,814
So I just want to thank you
for coming over this time

176
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,190
to give me drugs.

177
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,276
Well, you can't go wrong
with Dr. Hu's drugs.

178
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,027
They're from another dimension.

179
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,280
These are gonna help me
focus and get work done, right?

180
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,657
Oh, yes. These are what
I give college students

181
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,701
so when they come to, their term
papers have written themselves.

182
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,454
That's exactly what he needs.

183
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,956
Also, I should probably
do another one.

184
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,749
[sniffs]

185
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,252
Oh, it's "Hu."
Dr. Hu.

186
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,379
That's right, Dr. Hu.
Dr. Allen Hu.

187
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,048
No, no, no, but I thought
it was "Who," like <i>Doctor Who.</i>

188
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,633
Yes, that's exactly
what it's like.

189
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,553
No, not H-U, but, "who,"
like, "Hello, who is it?"

190
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,473
Uh, I don't know.
Who is it?

191
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,224
I'm sorry, is this a joke?
Is he telling a joke

192
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,101
- that I just don't--
- Hard to tell.

193
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,062
Sometimes I just laugh after he
talks so he'll leave me alone.

194
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,898
Seriously? Am I the only one
who knows the extremely popular

195
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,401
BBC science fiction show about
the time traveling doctor

196
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,487
- who saves civilizations?
- Oh, yeah.

197
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,364
I know what you're
talking about-- <i>Doctor Who.</i>

198
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,823
- Yes?
- No.

199
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,658
- Yes, thank you. <i>Doctor Who.</i>
- Yes?

200
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,286
I saw the one where
she goes to the Wild West.

201
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,413
The Cheyenne called her
Medicine Woman.

202
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,457
What?
No, that's Dr. Quinn.

203
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,583
- Who's Dr. Quinn?
- I most certainly am not.

204
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,337
Hu's not Dr. Quinn.
Hu's Dr. Hu.

205
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,339
- I don't know.
- [both] Third base!

206
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,965
When are these drugs
going to kick in?

207
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,675
Any minute now,
if they haven't already.

208
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,886
I want you to take three
of these every hour

209
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,347
and take two of these
every 1/2 hour.

210
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,640
Whatever you do, don't take
more than four of these

211
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,893
every 90 minutes, and take
the first two of the three

212
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,521
before you take
the second two of the four.

213
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,689
And don't expose yourself
to bright light or get wet.

214
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,234
- So... Gremlin rules?
- Exactly!

215
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,777
Well, I'm off to perform
child heart surgery.

216
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,863
[groans]
Wish me luck.

217
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,615
[sniffs] Ahh.

218
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,326
All right, team, focus up.

219
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,828
We got a book to write.

220
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,747
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, my God, this is so good.

221
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,290
It's good.

222
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,751
- So good, so good.
- [upbeat eerie music]

223
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,671
Okay, Todd, how is it going
with the heartwarming anecdotes?

224
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,507
Great! I'm writing
about that time

225
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,467
we officially became
best friends.

226
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,053
Nice! Can you change
best to pretty good?

227
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,638
Sarah Lynn, how's it coming with
the <i>Horsin' Around</i> years?

228
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,141
Almost done with the story
where Hulk Hogan guest starred

229
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,601
and told us to say no to drugs.

230
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,354
Great.
Keep typing, monkeys.

231
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,814
If only Hulk Hogan
could see us now, right?

232
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,567
What?

233
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,194
Because Sarah Lynn said
the thing about Hulk Hogan?

234
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,613
That was like four hours ago.

235
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,407
Oh, uh, right.

236
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,200
- How we doing now?
- Sending.

237
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,411
- Just about to send.
- Nice.

238
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,870
Okay, this is great.

239
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,081
That puts us at 216 pages?

240
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,251
Holy shit, that's almost as long
as <i>The Firm</i> by John Grisham.

241
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,253
And we just needed
to get to 200, right?

242
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,629
I'm just gonna keep writing.

243
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,424
I got a lot of synapses
firing right now.

244
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,676
It's surprisingly literate
and insightful, but still fun.

245
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,221
It's a beach read you can
thumb through in a wing chair.

246
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,265
Can't believe Diane
thought this was so hard.

247
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,017
"Ow, my fingers are cramping
from all this typing.

248
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,479
It's like they're
having their period."

249
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,105
Did Diane really say that?

250
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,399
No, but my fingers
are cramping.

251
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,944
It's like they're having
their period, am I right?

252
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,028
[laughs]

253
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,323
Are you just laughing
so I'll leave you alone?

254
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,740
[laughs]

255
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,159
Good one.

256
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,202
We just need a way
to end this thing.

257
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,079
What should the ending be?

258
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,999
Maybe it was Earth all along.

259
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,001
Not that,
but something like that.

260
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,461
Keep thinking.

261
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,469
Uh...

262
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,803
[whinnies]

263
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,054
I got it!

264
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,265
Did you guys switch clothes?

265
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,517
[Sarah's voice] No.

266
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,353
[talking backwards]

267
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,062
- Uh... What... Huh--
- I don't know.

268
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,648
I like your idea better,
BoJack.

269
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,191
- What?
- Your idea for the ending.

270
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,567
- Oh, what'd I say?
- About Maine.

271
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,361
About how you end up in Maine.

272
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,821
I like the part where you swim
in the lake in the summers.

273
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,949
Yeah, right, and when I get
too old to take care of myself,

274
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,618
I go for one last swim.

275
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,244
<i>I know I can't make it</i>
<i>back to shore.</i>

276
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,829
<i>I'm too weak, too tired.</i>

277
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,248
<i>So I just let the water</i>
<i>take me under.</i>

278
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,043
Eesh! Downer ending.

279
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,212
- You got something better?
- Wait a minute.

280
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,214
Maybe we don't know
the ending yet

281
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,090
because you haven't lived it.

282
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,301
Yeah, I mean,
if you want to, like, finish

283
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,555
finish the book, then you'd
have to, like, die tonight.

284
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,723
Oh, I know!
I should murder you.

285
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,601
[laughter]

286
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,395
I'm serious.

287
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,521
Think about it.

288
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,315
If the little girl
you raised on television

289
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,150
killed you in real life--

290
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:18,279
[gasps]
people would eat that shit up.

291
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,865
I love it. It's perfect.
We'll sell so many books.

292
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,285
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, kill BoJack!

293
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,123
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Oh, yes!

294
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,833
There it is!
Oh, yeah, gonna get you!

295
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:31,918
No, no, no, no--

296
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,211
Ah!

297
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,839
[all yelling]
[ominous rock music]

298
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,676
Okay, so what did we learn?

299
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,886
We learned that if
we're going to do drugs

300
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,763
we should do them at home where
it's safe to do them together,

301
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,973
right, Todd?

302
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,058
- No!
- Ahh!

303
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,560
Don't worry, guys.

304
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,853
I have this gun to keep
us safe from intruders.

305
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,480
- And each other.
- Wait, wait, wait.

306
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,940
Is that just
your gun-shaped lighter,

307
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,275
or your lighter-shaped gun?

308
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,402
Busted!
It's just a lighter.

309
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,737
- [gunshot]
- [all] Aah!

310
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,154
Shit, I guess it's my gun.

311
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,698
Then what'd I do
with my lighter?

312
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,408
And what did I give
to that baby?

313
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,826
Ha, I have a gun, too.

314
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,163
Don't be a Silly Billy.
That's a broom.

315
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,666
Wait, am I holding a gun?

316
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,377
Todd, are you holding
a gun or a broom?

317
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,171
I can't tell anymore!

318
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,716
I guess we'll just have
to shoot them at each other

319
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,761
at the same time to find out!

320
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,429
Okay!

321
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,723
Todd, sh-- Oh-- Can I just say--
Todd, Todd, I need you--

322
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,683
I need you to shh.
Listen, listen, Todd.

323
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,227
Okay, just to be totally clear,
we're shooting each other

324
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,688
to determine whether we're
holding guns or brooms, right?

325
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,440
Not because you're still mad
about the whole

326
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,899
me sabotaging you
with the rock opera

327
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,401
and your live stream
and suchety-such?

328
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,194
BoJack, shh, shh, okay, Bo?

329
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,904
Quiet, quiet,
quiet, quiet.

330
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,531
As you know, I was hurt,

331
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,575
but then I realized
that's just how you are.

332
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,202
You know, and maybe I just
need to stop expecting you

333
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,037
to be a good person,

334
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,873
so that way, I won't
get hurt when you're not.

335
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,917
Oh, o-- Okay.

336
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,586
Hey, this isn't fair.

337
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,920
I don't have a gun.

338
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,798
Sarah Lynn is right.

339
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,008
You know, if we all had guns,

00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,905
I don't like that
he drives a motorcycle.

516
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,949
Honey, a Vespa
is not a motorcycle.

517
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,408
[laughs]

518
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,285
Okay, okay.

519
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,204
What are you thinking about?

520
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,831
Oh, just how nice
things could've been

521
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,708
if you had chosen this life.

522
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,169
[distant rhythmic sound]

523
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:39,548
[cell phone vibrating]

524
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,718
- Oh... what? Where?
- [vibrating, music playing]

525
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,303
Hello?

526
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,305
BoJack, I read the pages
you sent me last night,

527
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,809
and I have to tell you,
your book is absolutely,

528
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,894
without a doubt, the most...

529
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,229
gibberish.

530
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,231
<i>- It's gibberish.</i>
- What day is it?

531
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,024
Let's see what you got here.

532
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,026
You got 20 pages of
<i>Doctor Who</i> erotic fan fiction,

533
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,487
<i>a recipe for soup,</i>
<i>five different theories</i>

534
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,030
<i>about how 9/11 happened,</i>

535
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,991
and a bunch
of embedded YouTube videos

536
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,367
that can't possibly
be printed in book form.

537
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,703
- Okay, I gotta go.
- [beep]

538
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,542
Any questions, at all,

539
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,129
for our panel of ghostwriters?

540
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:21,174
Um, yeah, I have a question
for Tori Spelling.

541
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:25,094
Again, Tori Spelling is not
here, as I already explained.

542
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,972
Tori Spelling's
ghostwriter is here.

543
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,890
This is a ghostwriter
convention.

544
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,433
How do you not--

545
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,559
[clears throat]

546
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,061
Okay, next question?

547
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,647
Uh, yeah,
this is for the whole panel.

548
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,650
What's your favorite kind
of ghost to write for?

549
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,486
What?
No, they don't write for ghosts.

550
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,698
That's not wha-- Why did I think
this would be a good idea?

551
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,285
Does anyone have
an actual question

552
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,369
for someone on this panel?

553
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,373
An actual question, or a gun,
so I can shoot myself?

554
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,500
[BoJack] <i>Yeah, I got a question.</i>

555
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,169
Oh, thank God.

556
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,671
[microphone feedback]
My question is for Diane.

557
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,883
Look, I'm sorry about all the
stuff I said about you earlier.

558
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,718
We can publish
the book you wrote.

559
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,594
You're obviously a better
writer than I am,

560
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:10,223
and I don't actually
even really care

561
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,225
what the world thinks
about me anymore.

562
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,060
I just hated reading that book

563
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,478
because I hated feeling like
that's how you saw me.

564
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,106
Because I guess you know me
better than anybody,

565
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,483
and if you think that--

566
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,195
Um, I guess my question is, do you--

567
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,322
Do you think
it's too late for me?

568
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,115
What?

569
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,743
I mean, am I just doomed
to be the person that I am?

570
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,786
The-- The person in that book?

571
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,789
It's not too late for me, is it?
It's-- It's not too late--

572
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,251
Diane, I need you to tell me
that it's not too late.

573
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,336
- BoJack, I--
- I-- I need you to tell me

574
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,879
that I'm a good person.

575
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,756
I know that I can be selfish
and narcissistic

576
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,758
and self-destructive,
but underneath all that,

577
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,425
deep down, I'm a good person,

578
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,929
and I need you to tell me
that I'm good, Diane.

579
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:54,100
Tell me, please, Diane.
Tell me that I'm good.

580
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,648
[bird calling]

581
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:05,694
