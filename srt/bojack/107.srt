00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,019
And you're not even
really in love with her.

171
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,562
You just think you are
because you pay her

172
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,064
to listen to you
talk about yourself.

173
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,565
Diane getting engaged
was the best thing

174
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,816
that ever happened to me.

175
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,485
It made me realize you're
the one I need to be with.

176
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,073
Ha! You say that every time
something bad happens.

177
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,783
Not getting nominated
for a People's Choice Award

178
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,534
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

179
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,036
It made me realize--

180
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,704
Getting caught
with that pound of cocaine

181
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,539
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

182
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,041
That hooker getting pregnant

183
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,334
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

184
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,211
Sneezing on Marisa Tomei
was the best--

185
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,671
Every time
something bad happens,

186
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,715
you come running to me
for comfort.

187
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,592
Well, it's not gonna happen
this time.

188
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,803
I can't be your agent
and your girlfriend.

189
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,554
- It just doesn't work.
- [knock on door]

190
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,432
I have Lenny Turteltaub
for you.

191
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,891
- I have to take this.
- Okay.

192
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,436
But remember,
I'm coming for you,

193
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,063
and I'm gonna make you love me.

194
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,982
Please don't.
Hey.

195
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,275
Bad news, P.C.

196
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,568
Braff used your merger as
an opportunity to jump ship.

197
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,736
Aw, fish.

198
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,156
Now his new agent's
asking for twice the money.

199
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,408
As I once said
to a young Lionel Barrymore,

200
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,493
"Eh, shut up."

201
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,663
Without a director, <i>Eva Braun</i>
is as dead as Eva Braun.

202
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,998
Yep.
You got to get someone big.

203
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,583
- <i>What about those brothers</i>--
- Hello? Hello?

204
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,127
Lady, you work too hard.

205
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,171
That was
an important phone call.

206
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,298
Important phone call
beep boop blorp.

207
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,882
Don't you robot-voice me.

208
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,385
Princess Carolyn,
what are we doing?

209
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,762
Well, I'm working,
and you are leaving.

210
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,140
Before I go, I got you
a little sexy something

211
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,683
to remember me by.

212
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,685
Since we can't be together
every second,

213
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,980
which would be my preference,
I give you cardboard BoJack.

214
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,523
It's got
a light-sensitive sound chip,

215
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,816
so every time you walk by it,

216
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,193
it quotes a line
from <i>Jerry Maguire</i>,

217
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,444
your favorite movie.

218
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,778
<i>You complete me.</i>

219
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,071
What do you think?
Pretty sweet, huh?

220
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,698
<i>You had me at "hello."</i>

221
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,867
I don't have time for you
or cardboard you.

222
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,202
I need to find
a new director.

223
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,288
Or you could find
my nude erector--

224
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,414
She's gone.

225
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,000
[jazzy music]

226
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,210
[elevator bell dings]

227
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,004
Blech.
Word to the wise, Laura--

228
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,798
Do not pitch a Nazi romance
to Steven Spielberg.

229
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,300
Just thought you should know

230
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,676
there's been some
reorganization

231
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,678
- vis-a-vis resource management.
- What are you saying?

232
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,514
You and Vanessa Gekko
are sharing an office

233
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,265
until they can find her
a permanent one.

234
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,184
- The hell we are.
- Also...

235
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,728
Good news, Princess Carolyn.
Vanessa's my agent now.

236
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,854
What?

237
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,814
You said you couldn't be
my girlfriend and my agent,

238
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,483
so I'm firing you.

239
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,109
Now we can be in love.

240
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,029
- Hope you like money, BoJack.
- This is so great.

241
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,865
Now I can date you
and have a better agent.

242
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,450
- Everybody wins.
- Oh.

243
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,868
<i>I'm a sporting agent.</i>

244
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,163
Are you still
searching for happiness?

245
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,623
Make your own happiness.

246
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,127
Mmm, that's some Guten
Bourbon.

247
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,795
Cut.
That was great.

248
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,215
Was it? You know, I'm trying
to do good work here,

249
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,176
really find the character,
but it's pretty distracting

250
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,677
to have all these robots

251
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,846
staring at me
with their blinking red eyes.

252
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,682
Those are cameras, Todd.
We're making a commercial.

253
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,560
Oh, well,
you want to make a good one?

254
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,603
Then get them
the hell out of here!

255
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,190
I'm the face of this brand,
I'm the man behind the thing,

256
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,192
and I'm determined
to get the jargon

257
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:13,238
of this German bourbon blurbin'.

258
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,697
Is it just me,
or does this fake booze

259
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,575
taste a lot like real booze?

260
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,411
You want BoJack,
you can have him.

261
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,496
Here's a list of directors
who won't work with him,

262
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,123
studios that won't hire him,

263
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,291
former assistants
with restraining orders.

264
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,708
This is great.

265
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,168
You know,
it gets kind of boring

266
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,212
when all your clients
are in such demand,

267
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,047
they practically
find their own jobs.

268
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,592
Well, then BoJack should be
a lot of fun for you.

269
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,969
- No one wants to hire him.
- [knock on door]

270
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,598
Hello. We're looking
for BoJack Horseman's agent.

271
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,266
We'd like to discuss

272
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,810
a very lucrative business
opportunity.

273
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,062
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I'm BoJack's agent.

274
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,190
The opportunity
is we're blackmailing you.

275
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,942
Ha. All yours.

276
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,527
Needless to say,

277
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,071
it would be a shame
if these pictures got out.

278
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,449
Fortunately, that can
easily be avoided

279
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:03,455
by simply paying me
and my partner here $150.

280
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,747
Each.

281
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,957
Let me just get my
checkbook.

282
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,041
Huh?

283
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,585
- Whoa.
- [chuckles]

284
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,254
Oh, except California law
prohibits taking photos

285
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,173
on private property
without a permit,

286
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,257
but you had a permit, right?

287
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,009
- Uh...
- What's that?

288
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,302
Oh, also, extortion can be
prosecuted

289
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,470
as a class E felony.

290
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,263
That's four years
in prison, easy,

291
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,223
and when you throw in
the murder of Tupac Shakur...

292
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,350
- We didn't do that.
- Yeah, yeah.

293
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,851
You can't pin that on us.

294
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,394
Well, someone's got
to take the fall.

295
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,687
- [both gulp]
- Sorry to bother you.

296
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,815
Forget we were ever here.

297
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,654
That was fun.

298
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,656
Hey, Laura, send those guys
a nice fruit-and-nut basket.

299
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,073
You got it, boss.

300
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,699
Who said you could use
my assistant?

301
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,578
- I did.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon.

302
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,246
<i>Did you know the human head</i>
<i>weighs 8 pounds?</i>

303
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,623
Fascinating.

304
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,250
So sorry we have
to double up on everything

305
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,253
while we work out who goes
where and who gets fired,

306
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,632
but in the meantime,
help yourself to an intern,

307
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,510
one of the rising stars
at our company--

308
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,389
- Charlie Witherspoon.
- Hello. I-- Oh.

309
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,684
Sorry, my-- My hands
are really sticky.

310
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,810
[groans]

311
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,564
Oh, God, am I blowing this?

312
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,273
[glass shatters]

313
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,026
Charlie was the editor
of <i>The Harvard Lampoon.</i>

314
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,570
He can be Princess Carolyn's
new assistant

315
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,778
while I use Laura.

316
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,905
- Ugh.
- Good thinking, boss.

317
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,448
[phone rings]

318
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,034
Ah, ah, phone is ringing.
Phone is ringing.

319
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,661
What do I do?
What do I do?

320
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,372
I'll take it in here,
Charlie. Hello.

321
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,832
Princess Carolyn,
your client is out of control.

322
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,918
BoJack is not
my client anymore.

323
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,545
Not BoJack.
Todd.

324
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,297
I think someone mixed alcohol
into his prop drink.

325
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,840
Oh, you pretenders.

326
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,758
Bourbon is the name
of a county.

327
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,596
You can't just make bourbon
in Germany.

328
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,639
That would be like
making Rice-A-Roni

329
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,517
- anywhere but San Francisco.
- No, no, no, no, no.

330
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,604
- Ugh. I'll be right there.
- Ow.

331
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,313
You got to get
your shit together.

332
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,149
You are a winner, okay?
You are Todd-- Hold on.

333
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:59,028
<i>4:30 p.m.</i>
<i>Meeting with Eva Braun team.</i>

334
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,490
Fish.
Okay, you are Todd goddamn--

335
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,492
- What's your last name?
- Chavez.

336
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,369
- Your last name is Chavez?
- Yeah. Why?

337
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,870
I don't know,
I just never thought of you

338
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,539
as a Chavez.
Look, I got to go.

339
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,332
I feel like you didn't
really finish the pep talk.

340
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,917
I know, but I got a movie
to put together.

341
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,043
Best of luck.

342
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,046
Ready for the tagline?
Here's the tagline.

343
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,131
What the heck is going on?

344
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,092
"The woman who loved the man
who hated everyone."

345
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,219
- That writes itself.
- You got to be kidding me.

346
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,847
Hey, where were you?
We looked everywhere.

347
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,058
You're having the <i>Eva Braun</i>
meeting without me?

348
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,851
I'm so sorry,

349
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,979
but I didn't know what
the protocol was around here,

350
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,939
and these guys were just
champing at the bit.

351
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,983
- We're just wrapping up.
- But Cate is my client.

352
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,943
Okay, why don't I come
find you when it's over,

353
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,570
and I'll bring you up to speed?

354
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,656
Is that Quentin Tarantulino?

355
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,532
Yeah.
I brought him on board.

356
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,701
You know he's always wanted
to direct a romantic comedy?

357
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,953
<i>Eva Braun</i>
is not a romantic comedy.

358
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,371
[sing-song] Bye.

359
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,791
[dramatic music]

360
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,628
<i>We live in a cynical world,</i>
<i>a cynical world.</i>

361
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,879
He's right, you know.

362
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,133
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, over-rotate.
Hey.

363
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,802
I just missed
an important meeting

364
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,262
because I was babysitting
Todd, who's too drunk to work,

365
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,389
because you switched out
the prop bourbon

366
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,184
with the real bourbon.
You are ruining my life.

367
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,436
- Have dinner with me tonight.
- No way.

368
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,023
Come on, just me, you,
and a bottle of Pinot.

369
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,566
Probably more than one bottle
and some entrees.

370
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,360
And I'll probably get
an appetizer.

371
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,236
I own the restaurant,
so we can go crazy.

372
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,739
- I have to work.
- You don't have to work.

373
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:28,284
- You choose to work.
- Hmm.

374
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,578
Why not choose to be happy
for once?

375
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,580
Mm.

376
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,166
[soft piano music]

377
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,668
When you're writing a memoir,

378
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,504
you spend a lot of time
reflecting on the past.

379
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,382
I regret not being
a better friend to you

380
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,091
and lover.

381
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,385
Thank you.

382
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,803
Lover's kind of a weird word,

383
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,471
but thanks.

384
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,557
You want to get out
of this stuffy old restaurant,

385
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,017
get some gelato, and maybe
drive out to the ocean

386
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,396
- and put our feet in the water?
- That sounds great.

387
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,398
Let me just freshen up
my whiskers.

388
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,817
Great. I'll get the car
and meet you outside.

389
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,318
You scamper right back,
pussycat.

390
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,862
You look at your reflection
too long,

391
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,446
you might fall in love.
She's gone.

[cell phone rings]

393
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,492
What do you want, Gekko?

394
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,452
Well, I was hoping
to talk to you face-to-face,

395
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,287
but I guess you had
to leave work early.

396
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,122
I left at 8:30.
What is it?

397
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,543
Well, Cate and I
had a really good talk today.

398
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,420
<i>We have so much in common,</i>

399
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,756
<i>and especially since I'm doing</i>
<i>so much for </i>Eva Braun<i>,</i>

400
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,216
<i>it almost seemed weird</i>
<i>that I wasn't repping her.</i>

401
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,552
No. No. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

402
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,929
She and I are both
high-powered working mothers,

403
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,348
so I understand her
priorities,

404
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,392
so she's switching to Gekko.

405
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,061
Wow, being a mom
helped my career?

406
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,230
I really can have it all.

407
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,733
This isn't fair.
I know everything about Cate.

408
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,234
Her favorite color is red.

409
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,027
Her favorite book
is <i>Suffragette City.</i>

410
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,654
Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.

411
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,322
I know all I need to know,

412
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,032
which is that she's beautiful,
she's British,

413
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,451
and she's gonna make me
a lot of money.

414
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,411
She's Australian, you moron.

415
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,204
If you need me,
I'll be at work.

416

417
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,750

You know what?
Never mind.

If Vanessa Gekko wants Cate
that bad, she can have her.

I'm gonna be okay.
I'm gonna be happy.

This was a mistake.
I've been acting crazy.

That phone call just
pulled me back to reality.

You were right.
I don't love you.

You don't love me.

Well, this night took
a turn.

get excited anyway.

on you, then?

gonna give me a ride home?

when they're not fine.

Anyway, I'm off to Malibu
to see Herb Kazzaz.

He has cancer, which,
as you know, is a whole thing.

really use some good news

512
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,809
so I shredded BoJack's
contract

513
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,185
right in front of her.
Heh heh

514
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,270
What? You just signed BoJack
yesterday.

515
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,357
I say good riddance
to Mr. Houseman

516
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,151
or whatever
that horse's name is.

517
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,486
It's not like he makes
this company any money,

518
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,447
and he does seem to take up
an awful lot of your time.

519
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,909
<i>I'm from Arizona, Jerry.</i>
<i>I went to Arizona State.</i>

520
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,037
<i>Todd, how do I</i>
<i>turn this thing off?</i>

521
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,412
<i>Todd.</i>

522
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,373
<i>[Todd] What? I'm busy.</i>

523
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,501
<i>[BoJack] Never mind.</i>
<i>Think I've figured it out.</i>

524
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,087
<i>Now that I've got the room</i>

<i>[trombone plays]</i>

527
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,513
He's kind of in
a bad place right now.

528
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,015
You can't just drop him.

529
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,474
The best agent
in this building

530
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,060
couldn't get that guy a job.

531
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,144
The best agent
in this building

532
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,687
got him a job yesterday,

533
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,023
and I could get him a feature
by the end of today.

534
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,607
If you want to get him
a movie

535
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,401
by the end of the day,
great, do that.

536
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,486
Otherwise, we are washing
our hands of him.

537
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,199
Charlie, I hear NBC picked up
your running tie show.

538
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,242
Congratulations.

539
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,327
[Charlie] Thank you, Dad.

540
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,208
Hey, Marty,
Princess Carolyn here.

541
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,086
How'd you like to work with
the BoJack Horseman?

542
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,213
What's that?
You hate his guts?

543
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,548
What's that?
He's a talentless boob?

544
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,594
What's that? You'll never
work with BoJack again?

545
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,762
What's that?

546
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,139
You want him to die in
an ass factory warehouse fire,

547
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:08,017
smothering to death
under a pile of burning asses?

548
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,477
Well, if you change your mind,
give me a call.

549
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,521
Oh, BoJack, what am I
gonna do with you?

550
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,606
I don't understand

551
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,524
why you're going through
all this trouble for him.

552
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,693
That guy's dead weight,
Princess Carolyn.

553
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,320
If you don't cut him loose,
you're never gonna be happy.

554
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,073
<i>Help me help you.</i>

555
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,076
That's it.
Of course.

556
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,120
Cameron Crow,
you skinny bitch.

557
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,956
You know <i>Jerry Maguire</i>'s
my favorite movie of all time?

558
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,707
All your films are so human,

559
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,918
which is super impressive
since you're a crow.

560
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,962
Well, my name is
Cameron Crow,

561
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,504
but I'm actually a raven,

562
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,465
so common misconception.

563
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,008
- Well, whatever you are--
- A raven.

564
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,677
- I brought you this
- <i>Suffragette City</i>...

565
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,139
"a coming of age story
about rock music,

566
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:50,226
being a teenager in the '80s
and buying zoos"?

567
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,061
How have I not
heard of this book?

568
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,229
You'd be the perfect
director

569
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,396
to make a movie out of it,

570
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,982
and I happen to know this is

571
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,275
Cate Blanchett's
favorite book.

572
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,485
I'll bet she'll drop
everything to play the part.

573
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,445
You should give her a caw.

574
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,282
Okay, I see-- Yeah.
Caw is what crows say.

575
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,867
Again, I am not a crow.

576
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:10,246
[jazzy music]

577
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,999
Cate, listen to me,
you're making a big mistake.

578
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,293
<i>Eva Braun</i>
is your dream, remember?

579
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,544
Cate? Hello?

580
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,546
Cate!

581
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,340
Oh, no. What happened?

582
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,550
Did Cate drop out of
your little Holocaust movie

583
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,595
so she could make
my little Cameron Crow movie?

584
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,555
Why don't you go home
and cry about it

585
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,516
to your loving husband
and children?

586
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,101
Say, which one of you

587
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,061
is overseeing
the <i>Eva Braun</i> package?

588
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,813
That would be me, sir.

589
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,024
Vanessa, you really
shat the bed on this one.

590
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,484
Now, are you fired?
Not exactly.

591
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,320
Can you still work here? No.

592
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,988
Lenny Turteltaub
here to see you.

593
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,823
Thanks, Laura.

594
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,908
So, one minute I'm making
a movie with Cate Blanchett.

595
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,785
Next, I hear she's doing
a picture with Cameron Crow

596
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,120
about mix tapes.

597
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,663
As I said to Ed Porter

598
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,372
at the premiere of
<i>The Great Train Robbery</i>,

599
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,625
"Aah, the train's
coming right at me."

600
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,669
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know, Lenny.

601
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,420
<i>Eva Braun</i>
was Vanessa's project.

602
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,048
All that work for nothing.

603
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,217
Now Quentin Tarantulino's
got four arms up my ass

604
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,302
'cause he got all excited
about making a rom-com.

605
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,386
You know what would be
a great romantic comedy?

606
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,764
Remember when that guy stole
the D from the Hollywood sign

607
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,850
so he could propose
to his girlfriend?

608
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,727
That would make
a great movie,

609
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,103
but who would play the lead?

610
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,314
Preferably someone
kind of washed up.

611
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,357
You know how much Quentin

612
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,691
loves to revitalize
dead careers.

613
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,276
It's kind of his thing.

614
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,402
Well, in that case,
you know who'd be great?
