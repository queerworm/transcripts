00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,766
Oh, no. No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

2
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,812
Sorry to interrupt your lunch,
but there was another mass shooting.

3
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,731
Oh, God, where?

4
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,482
A town outside Tampa called--

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,110
Not geographically, dipshit.
What's the location?

6
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,279
What is it, a pharmacy? A haberdashery?

7
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,074
-It was a shopping mall.
-No!

8
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,287
-<i>Ms. Taken</i> is coming out next month.
-I know, sir.

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,372
The whole third act
revolves around Courtney Portnoy

10
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,832
shooting people in a mall.

11
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,543
What are we supposed to do now,
not release the movie?

12
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,211
I hope it doesn't come to that.

13
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,672
I am sick and tired
of real-life gun violence

14
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,759
getting in the way of us telling stories
that glamorize gun violence.

15
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,179
Why does this keep happening?
Has the whole world gone crazy?

16
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,849
No, we've just been conditioned
by a rugged individualist culture

17
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,643
woven into the savage architecture
of our country itself,

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,479
birthed as it was
through violent uprising,

19
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,398
but perhaps popularized
in the modern imagination by stories of--

20
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,108
Okay, Chomsky, when I want you to talk,

21
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,194
I'll staple a string to your back
and then yank it.

22
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,487
Why not make yourself useful

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,614
and schedule a sit-down
with Courtney Portnoy's team

24
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,533
to talk about how we distance ourselves
from this <i>fakakte mishegoss.</i>

Works for me every time.

163
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,565
[inhales and puffs]

164
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,820
Mrs. Horseman, you have a visitor.

165
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,865
Oh, uh...

166
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,409
-Hi, Mom.
-Do I know you?

167
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,370
Here we go.
Yes, Mom, I never visit. You got me.

168
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,581
-Henrietta?
-Okay, we're doing this?

169
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,625
I think she really doesn't know
who you are.

170
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,585
She knows.
This is just like when she pretended

171
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,755
not to recognize me
after my shaky choir solo in eighth grade.

172
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,798
I had to get a ride home with the pianist

173
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,218
who liked to tickle a lot more
than just the ivories.

174
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,888
When I made it home unscathed, she said,
"Huh. I guess no one wants you."

175
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,933
Henrietta, could I trouble you
for some orange juice, please?

176
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,227
Stop calling me Henrietta!
Nobody here's named Henrietta!

177
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,062
Henrietta, orange juice. Now!

178
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,980
You're not being paid
for polite conversation.

179
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,691
-BoJack, maybe you should just--
-Oh, hello! It's you.

180
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,692
Hollyhock.

181
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:51,948
I must apologize for Henrietta.
She learned to read on secondhand books.

182
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,701
Mom, do you really not know who I am?
Me, famous BoJack?

183
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,579
If you are getting orange juice,
I'd love a glass too.

184
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,415
Oh. Uh, okay.

185
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,380
So you see
I'm really quite ordinary and relatable.

186
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,882
Yeah, you put your pants on
one leg at a time.

187
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,010
Well, I step into my pants
one leg at a time,

188
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,347
then my trouser-maidens lift the legs
simultaneously to avoid wrinklage.

189
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,517
Well, right, of course,
why else have trouser-maidens?

190
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,312
-Hey.<i> Konichiwa, </i>Princess Mulan.
-Just leave us alone, okay?

191
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,689
I was giving you a compliment.

192
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,233
First, <i>konichiwa </i>is not a compliment,
it's Japanese for hello.

193
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,526
Second, I'm not Japanese.

194
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,861
Maybe I could put something
in that sweet mouth of yours

195
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,114
-so you don't have to talk so much.
-Whoa!

196
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,865
One more step, asshole.

197
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,075
-What...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

198
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,827
I was joking.
I don't want any trouble.

199
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,829
-Tell your story walking.
-...the...

200
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,748
shit was that?

201
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,251
I don't know! My instincts just kicked in.

202
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,961
Why do you even have a gun?

203
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,714
Well, using it in the movie
was so empowering,

204
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,550
and now I just carry it everywhere.
Do you want to hold it?

205
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,510
No, I am very anti-gun.

206
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,013
In fact, I think the whole idea of guns
is inherently--

207
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,141
Holy shit, I'm holding a gun.
How long has this been in my hand?

208
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,561
-Slides right in, doesn't it?
-It actually feels kind of nice.

209
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,230
Would you like to try shooting it?
We can go to my gun range.

210
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,773
You have your own gun range?

211
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,110
I'm Courtney Portnoy.
I have all the things.

212
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,905
[clicking]

213
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,793
[breathless gasp] Whoa...

214
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,921
[Bea] I can't believe you came back.

215
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,634
-Who, me? Or BoJack?
-You look just like him.

216
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,886
-People tell me that.
-[groans]

217
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,763
Your mother's dementia
is progressing rapidly.

218
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,097
-You came out of nowhere.
-Yes.

219
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,476
I snuck up on you on purpose as a symbol
for the alarming creep of dementia.

220
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,562
-It isn't there, until it is.
-Thank you, very colorful.

221
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,440
We tried to call you,
but the number you gave us

222
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,818
-connected to a sandwich shop in Temecula.
-Is that right?

223
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,945
This is the most responsive
she's been in weeks.

224
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,281
I think with regular visits
from you and your daughter--

225
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,240
That's not happening.

226
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,159
Seeing my mom
is like a Terrence Malick movie.

227
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,577
Every ten years or so is bearable,

228
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,579
but more than that
and it starts to get annoying.

229
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,248
She won't last another ten years.

230
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,250
-Well, I guess that's it, then. Bye, Mom!
-Huh?

231
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,294
Come on, Hollyhock,
let's blow this Jell-O stand.

232
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,254
We're gonna come back though, right?

233
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,798
We can't just leave her like this.

234
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,800
You can do anything
if you believe in yourself.

235
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,551
-We have to come back.
-[Bea] Henrietta?

236
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,719
-Every week.
-Why?

237
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,722
Because she's your mother
and dementia is hereditary.

238
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,433
One day, you're gonna be
in a home like this, and so will I,

239
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,685
and wouldn't you want
someone visiting you?

240
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,979
[groans] Fine.
We'll come back. Happy?

241
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,440
 Where's my orange juice, slag?

242
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,528
[gulping]

243
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,695
Ahhh!

244
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,240
[gulping]

245
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,033
Ahhh!
See ya next week.

246
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,246
[humming]

247
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,832
-Hey, are we out of milk?
-I can pick up some after work.

248
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:51,544
Great. Also, real quick follow-up,
why are you holding a gun?

249
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,628
Oh, my God!

250
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,798
Did I drive all the way home
without realizing I was holding a gun?

251
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,968
No wonder that guy at the gas station
didn't charge me for the Red Vines.

252
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,804
[gasps] Did I rob a gas station?

253
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,806
Classic Diane shenanigans.

254
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,226
Or as I call them, "Diane-igans."
All right, be safe.

255
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,978
-[smooches]
-[sighs]

256
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:10,855
Hmm.

257
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,151
[Diane] <i>Let's get one thing</i>
<i>out of the way right now.</i>

258
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,446
<i>If you're a man,</i>
<i>you're not gonna get it.</i>

259
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,781
<i>Some of you think you get it.</i>
<i>You want to get it.</i>

260
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,784
<i>You listen, nod</i>
<i>and say all the right things</i>

261
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,202
<i>when we tell you our stories.</i>

262
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,122
<i>But you still can't actually know</i>
<i>what it feels like</i>

263
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,208
<i>-to constantly have your guard up.</i>
-[wolf whistle]

264
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,920
<i>In parking garages,</i>
<i>walking the street, even at work.</i>

265
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,423
<i>I'm tired of trying</i>
<i>to help men understand</i>

266
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,049
<i>how it feels to be a woman.</i>

267
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,093
<i>Starting now,</i>
<i>I'm doing what it takes</i>

268
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,804
<i>to put the power in my own hands.</i>

269
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,056
<i>That's why I own a gun.</i>

270
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,899
-That was our senior picnic.
-Oh.

271
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,985
Oh, here I am. There's Polio Larry.

272
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,196
Yup, she sure remembers
all the important people.

273
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,948
-[Hollyhock] And who's this?
-[Bea] That's my brother, Crackerjack.

274
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,533
That's not Crackerjack, that's me.

275
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,285
Thirty seconds
after that picture was taken

276
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,370
you yelled at me
for getting ice cream on my shorts.

277
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,790
No ice cream for me, Henrietta.
I'm watching my figure.

278
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,460
Yeah, you want to look pretty
for when Death comes to visit.

279
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,711
Beth? No.

280
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,380
We stopped talking
after she wouldn't eat my casserole

281
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,509
and then I told the whole supper club
that her son was a gay.

282
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,093
-Ooh.
-Okay. You two enjoy each other.

283
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,554
I'm gonna go see
if I can seduce a lonely dowager

284
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,097
into giving me her night-night pills.

285
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,682
Wow. Is this you?

286
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:32,478
-[Bea] This is me at my debutante ball.
-You were so beautiful.

287
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:36,065
You could be thin, too.
Just go easy on the sweets

288
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,193
and when you go somewhere,
don't walk, gallop.

289
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,237
Ice cold, Grammy-gram.

290
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,865
{\an8}[both] Morning time, Hollywoo!

291
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,659
{\an8}I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

292
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,452
{\an8}And I'm A Billy Bush Type.

293
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,871
Here's something
I'm just now reading on a cue card.

294
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,499
All the ladies
are getting concealed carry permits.

295
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,750
It's the newest thing.

296
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,710
I wouldn't want to be around
one of those ladies

297
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,171
at a certain time of the month,
if you know what I mean.

298
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,965
[laughs] I don't.

299
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,134
Joking aside, I think it's great
these gals have a hobby.

300
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:08,681
Oh, and I'm being told by our producers
that we have a breaking news alert--

301
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,225
-there has been another mass shooting.
-[groans]

302
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,395
I am totally unqualified
to cover a news story this important.

303
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,523
But as a straight white male,
I will plow forward with confidence

304
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,942
and assume I'm doing fine.

305
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,280
[groans] Again with the crazy gunmen.

306
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,781
Princess Carolyn, if this keeps up,

307
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,783
we're gonna have to put this movie
on the shelf

308
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,911
next to that wacky vacation comedy we did
about the klutzy babysitter.

309
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,415
-[Todd] <i>Ha! That sounds hilarious!</i>
-What the hell are you doing on this call?

310
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,917
Imagining that funny movie
you just described.

311
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,169
Okay, what do all these shootings
have in common?

312
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,839
Guns? Bullets? Who are you,
Art Linkletter? Just spit it out.

313
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,634
Men! What if we played up
the "Ms." in <i>Ms. Taken</i>?

314
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,386
In a world of increasing terror,

315
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,806
our movie tells women
they don't have to be afraid anymore.

316
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,058
-Yeah, now you're talking.
-When you put it that way,

317
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,437
it almost sounds like these mass shootings
could be a good thing for the movie.

318
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,315
No, no, no, of course not.
They're a terrible tragedy.

319
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,025
Thoughts and prayers
are with the victims.

320
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,693
-Right, thoughts and prayers.
-But...

321
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:07,489
anything that makes women feel unsafe
might actually help our box office.

322
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,451
But you don't want women to feel unsafe.

323
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,368
Of course not!

324
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,120
Nobody wants that,
nobody's saying that.

325
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,664
But if they already <i>do</i> feel unsafe,

326
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,207
there's no reason not to capitalize.

327
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,293
Right, if they already feel unsafe anyway.

328
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,338
Exactly, we're not making them
feel unsafe.

329
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,634
We're just profiting, albeit indirectly,
from there being more mass shootings.

330
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,968
[cell phone vibrates]

331
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,346
In that case,
I got good news and I got bad news.

332
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,681
Bad news is
you're gonna want to avoid the 405.

333
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,977
-Ta-da!
-Ugh! Keep it down.

334
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,979
Why are you carrying that thin hard book?

335
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,773
It's not a book, it's a DVD case.

336
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,733
We did a special episode about elder care.

337
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,152
Now we're gonna watch it
and learn how to handle this bitch.

338
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,695
When you say "this bitch",

339
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,031
do you mean your mom's dementia
or your mom?

340
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,950
I think you can pick that up
through context.

341
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,368
Season two, episode 12.

00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,453

Mr. Dementia."

-I'll go lie down.

349
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,470
Hush, Henrietta.
That's my son on the television.

350
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,682
-You know him?
-I think I'd know my own son, wouldn't I?

351
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,016
[Ethan] <i>You heard the boss man.</i>

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,895
<i>Guess your daughter, the bikini model,</i>

<i>Daughter, the bikini model?</i>

<i>Whoa, whoa, Ethan,</i>

355
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,069
[laughs]

356
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,904
Uh...

357
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,030
Huh.

358
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,702
[clears throat]

359
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,871
-You know I hate guns, right?
-I know.

360
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,124
Although my official stated
political opinion

361
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,960
is I respect the Second Amendment
but I think some gun purchases

362
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,379
should require the barest amount 
of background checks.

363
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,923
Mr. Peanutbutter,
you know I hate guns, too.

364
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,342
Or I thought I did. Or I still do, mostly.

365
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,013
But being a gun owner finally makes me
feel as safe walking down the street

366
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,432
as a man gets to feel all the time.

367
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,143
And that's an incredible feeling
I'm not ready to give up yet.

368
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,812
If you can frack under our house,
I should get to have a gun.

369
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,063
All right, that's fair.

370
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,815
I'm really proud we've found a way

371
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,693
to keep our personal lives
and our political lives compartmentalized.

372
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,777
Me, too.

373
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,197
{\an8}<i>-You have no idea...</i>
<i>-Yes. I have no idea?</i>

374
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,700
{\an8}<i>-Is your bubble of privilege so thick...</i>
<i>-What's with humans and guns?</i>

375
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,243
{\an8}<i>You're addicted to these things.</i>

376
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,038
{\an8}<i>And what is it with men</i>
<i>and not wanting women to feel safe?</i>

377
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,539
{\an8}<i>-I don't--</i>
<i>-This is a gendered issue...</i>

378
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,874
{\an8}<i>-Excuse me!</i>
<i>-...make no mistake.</i>

379
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,459
{\an8}<i>-I don't think women...</i>
<i>-You can't sympathize...</i>

380
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,294
{\an8}<i>...running around with guns</i>

381
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,795
{\an8}<i>-Yeah. That's the danger.</i>
<i>-I don't--</i>

382
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,963
{\an8}<i>-Excuse me.</i>
<i>-Not the men</i>

{\an8}<i>who commit 90 percent of murders,</i>
<i>it's the crazy hysterical women</i>

{\an8}<i>you gotta worry about!</i>

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,970
[grunting and moaning]

386
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,807
[Diane] Yes, yes! Fill my chamber
with your powerful bullets!

387
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,770
Beatrice, look who's back.

388
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,730
And we brought more<i> Horsin' Around.</i>

389
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,939
Oh? Good.

390
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,233
Because you love that BoJack, right?

391
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,446
Well, he's not much of a son,
but the show can be a comfort sometimes.

392
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,947
[exhales]

393
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,037
They were playing your dumb show
in his hospital room.

394
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,331
Which dumb show? New one or old one?

395
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,751
In the episode I saw, you walked in
on your daughter in the shower.

396
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,795
The old one. That episode got us

397
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,464
into the <i>TV Guide</i>
"Cheers and Jeers" column.

398
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,715
We did not get a "Cheers."

399
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,301
You always could play the fool, BoJack.

400
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,970
We have to have this conversation now,
on the way to Dad's funeral?

401
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,433
[sighs] There was so much more
I wanted to say to him.

402
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,728
Well... you can forget it now.

403
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,358

404
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:34,321

Out of the way, hag,
you're blocking the screen.

408
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,371
Uh-huh.

409
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,671
I know this must be painful for you.

410
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,132
Not painful, boring. This place sucks.

411
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,425
If I'm not getting credit
for coming, what's the point?

412
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,388
If only there was some way for her
to connect the BoJack from the show

413
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,390
with the BoJack who visits her every week.

414
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:05,853
-Yeah, too bad we can't. Or can we?
-Can we what?

415
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,730
Put on a live episode
of <i>Horsin' Around </i>in the nursing home.

416
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,274
-Good thinking, Hollyhock.
-Uh...

417
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,192
We'll do a <i>Horsin' Around</i>
here at the home.

418
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,069
She'll love it
because it's her son BoJack.

419
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,737
-Okay...
-Then after the show,

420
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,783
I'll come out and say hello.
And she'll say, "BoJack? Is that you?"

421
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,368
When her eyes spark with recognition,

422
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,704
I'm gonna sit down next to her,
I'm gonna squeeze her hand

423
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,914
and get real close and say...

424
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,292
-"Fuck you, Mom."
-What?

425
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,711
I can finally tell her off!
I'm gonna say, "Look at you,

426
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,130
you old piece of shit,
rotting in a nursing home!"

427
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,757
-Now I have the power!
-That's what you want to say to her?

428
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,094
Oh, it's gonna be great!
I can't wait to see the look on her face.

429
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,389
Okay, let's do this. Let's put on a show!

430
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,187
[ringing]

431
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,479
-Hey!
-Bad news.

432
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,231
Hear about the mass shooting
outside Tulsa?

433
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,108
Terrible tragedy.
Thoughts and prayers.

434
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,485
We really have to do something
about these men who go...

435
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,738
No, P.C. This time it was a woman.

436
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,658
A woman mass shooter?
Oh, no, that really <i>is </i>bad news!

437
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,661
{\an8}I just think this is what happens
when you give women guns.

438
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,288
{\an8}They start shooting people with them.

439
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,415
{\an8}I mean, do they even know
what guns are for?

440
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,627
{\an8}I don't feel safe anymore
walking down my own street alone at night.

441
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,794
{\an8}Me, a man!

442
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,714
{\an8}I am convening a series
of congressional hearings

443
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,507
{\an8}on the matter of women and guns.

444
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,844
{\an8}Because even one death
from the bullet of a female gun owner

445
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,137
{\an8}is too many.

446
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,598
{\an8}What are my constituents supposed to do,

447
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,559
{\an8}not compliment
random women on the street

448
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,269
{\an8}because they might be
carrying a gun?

449
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,565
{\an8}We cannot allow our lives
to be dictated by that kind of fear.

450
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:38,111
{\an8}So you see, the trigger was specifically
designed for a man's grip

451
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,155
{\an8}and a man's temperament.

452
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,657
{\an8}Look, all I'm saying is

453
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,785
{\an8}maybe you shouldn't blame women
for wanting guns.

454
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,829
{\an8}Maybe you should blame
the constant societal messaging

455
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:52,042
{\an8}that tells us we are safe only as long
as the men around us allow us to be.

456
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,462
{\an8}So if you have a problem
with women carrying firearms,

457
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,757
{\an8}you can roll up your sleeves
and actually work to create a society

458
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,387
{\an8}where women feel safe and equal,
or you can just ban all guns.

459
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,766
-[gavel banging]
-The ayes have it.

460
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,728
Possession of any firearm is now illegal
in the state of California.

461
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,813
We did it, boys.

462
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,772
-Huzzah!
-Yes!

463
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,774
-Congratulations!
-Fabulous!

464
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,443
I thought that was gonna go the other way.

465
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,030
Wow, Diane.
You just passed sensible gun legislation.

466
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,158
I can't believe this country hates women
more than it loves guns.

467
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,243
No?

468
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,040
BoJack, I don't know about this.

469
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,293
You'll be fine.
Just remember to enunciate.

470
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,420
It helps if you imagine
performing for the back row.

471
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,047
-Not that. I mean...
-Shh! Here they come. Gladys, hit it!

[plays <i>Horsin' Around</i> theme]

473

Too bad I could never run for president,
'cause I love waffling!

474
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,849
Wha-- What is this?

475
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,351
Olivia, you usually love
my breakfast humor.

476
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,811
Why so glum, sugarplum?

477
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,231
It's this algebra homework
that gives me the blues.

478
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,442
-X-axis? Y-axis?
-[panting and gasping]

479
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,902
Where's the 'Y'-should-I-care axis?

480
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,362
Henrietta, what are you doing?

481
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,989
BoJack, maybe we should stop.

482
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,450
We just started. Let's at least
get through the first act

483
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,660
before we judge ourselves
too harshly, huh?

484
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,163
I wonder if there's a way
to make math fun.

485
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,165
-[Hollyhock] Math will never be fun.
-[clicking]

486
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,876
-The only thing I like is rap music songs.
-[groaning and panting]

487
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,462
Make this stop. How do I turn this off?

488
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:22,007
Don't change it.
I want to see if this married couple

489
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,176
can work through their differences.

490
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,552
-Gimme the remote!
-This isn't right!

491
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,596
-Guys, sharing is caring!
-[grunts]

492
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,473
Oh, my God. Code red, code red!

493
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,683
What is happening? I don't like this!

494
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,684
No!

495
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,977
-[Bea] Let go of me.
-Oh, God.

496
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,773
I am the heiress
to the Sugarman Sugarcube Company.

497
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,317
You can't do this to me!

498
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,235
[screaming]

499
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,405
I never get to watch what I want.

500
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,951
You think we should
still finish the episode, or...?

501
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,372
Our insurance policy
is very strict and very clear.

502
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,417
Once a resident becomes violent,
we can no longer house them.

503
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,002
Can you recommend another facility?

504
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,962
Frankly, at your mother's rate
of deterioration,

505
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,506
she probably doesn't have much time.

506
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,759
I recommend she spend it surrounded
by the people who care about her.

507
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,636
Okay, who are they?
Do you have their number?

508
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,472
-I was referring to you and your daughter.
-Oh. Uh...

509
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,516
We'll take her.
She can have the guest room,

510
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,268
-and I can sleep on the couch. Right?
-[groans]

511
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,063
Okay. If she really doesn't have
much time left.

512
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,565
But if we get to this time next year,
she's still hanging on,

513
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,610
you will be getting
a very strongly worded letter, mister.

514
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,864
{\an8}<i>Excuse me, could you point me</i>
<i>in the direction of an H&amp;M?</i>

515
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,157
{\an8}<i>-Sure.</i>
-[click]

516
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,409
That's all we got,
once we took out all the guns.

517
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,286
Maybe it could work
as an H&amp;M commercial?

518
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,497
It's a shame. It was a great movie.

519
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,874
[sighs] Yeah.
Cut down in the prime of its life.

520
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,210
Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.

521
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,420
Eh, I'll be fine.

522
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,468
Hey, Beatrice, you hungry?
I could make Pop-Tarts.

523
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,512
[Bea] No, thank you.

524
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,140
You want to watch
another <i>Horsin' Around</i> episode?

525
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,432
What's the point?

526
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,351
-Oh.
-[growls]

527
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,686
Oh, God.

528
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,864
I'm sorry you didn't get
to tell your mom off.

529
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,866
I keep thinking
about all the things I never said

530
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,160
because I was so sure
there'd be other days to say them.

531
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,704
-Why don't you tell her now?
-It's not the same.

532
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,789
I should have done it
back when she knew who I was,

533
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,249
back when it would mean something.

534
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,709
But now, she's gonna die

535
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,878
and she's never gonna know
just how much I hate her.

536
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,921
I'm sure she knew, BoJack.

537
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,049
-Yeah? You're not just saying that?
-She read your book, didn't she?

538
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,720
[sighs] Yeah, but I really wanted
to say it to her face.

539
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:36,766
Well, hey, she's here now, right?
And she has good days and bad days.

540
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,938
Maybe, eventually, she'll recognize you.
And then you can totally rip into her.

541
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,732
-You really think so?
-Mm-hmm.

542
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,858
[chuckles]
