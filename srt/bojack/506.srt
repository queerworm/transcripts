[music playing over radio]

00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,739
Your mother's having another one
of her episodes.

8
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,490
Last night, she went to see <i>A Doll's House</i>

9
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,076
with a couple girlfriends,
and now she has ideas.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,911
I emerged from my sanctum, this afternoon,

11
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,372
to discover that not only had she
not made me lunch,

12
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,541
which is a meal I need in order to live,

13
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:45,628
but she'd furthermore, locked herself
in the bedroom to weep... loudly.

14
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,589
Now, it's one thing for a woman to weep,

15
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,383
but when they do it at such a volume
you can hear it through the door,

16
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,677
then you know they're doing it
just for the attention.

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,431
Anyway, I was able to cobble together
a sandwich for myself,

18
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,184
so, I'm the real hero of the story.

-[horn honking]

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,897
It was a couple hours later

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,274
when I realized I was on a good run
with my novel.

22
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,819
I had this really interesting sentence
that kept going for pages and pages,

23
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,947
and I thought about how rare it is
to really get in the groove like that.

24
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,075
How, most days, I can't concentrate

25
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,994
because my idiot child
is blasting the television,

26
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,413
and it suddenly dawned on me;
hot cock on a rock,

27
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,666
she never even picked up
the little noise and snot factory!

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,752
[tires screech, horn honking]

29
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,798
So, here I am, being your mother,

30
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,510
which I know is giving you all sorts
of mixed-up ideas about gender,

31
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,595
while your brain
is still loose and stupid.

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,679
Just remember,

33
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,891
if you become a queer later in life,
this isn't my fault!

34
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,645
Don't you sing no songs in your nightclub
act called, "My Daddy was My Mommy,"

35
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,689
while gazing longingly
at a tangled string of pearls.

36
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,608
Pearls are for ladies, BoJack.

37
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,861
Pearls are for ladies.

38
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,697
You know Sunday is my writing day.

39
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,951
Sundays are the one day
that are just for me and my craft,

40
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,370
and still, you and the black hole
that birthed you

41
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,996
conspire to ruin it for me.

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,499
What am I supposed to do now?
Just go back to writing?

43
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,043
I'm out of the zone now,
the whole day's shot!

44
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,379
All because of you
and that brittle wisp of a woman

45
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,297
you made the mistake
of making your mother.

46
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,718
[sighs] No. It's not her fault.

47
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,762
She's doing the best she can, after all.

48
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,348
It's just that...
you can't depend on women.

49
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,100
You can't depend on anyone.

50
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,518
Sooner or later, you need to learn

51
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,645
that no one else
is gonna take care of you.

52
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,523
That's what I learned
when I had to make my own sandwich.

53
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,525
You can't rely on other people, BoJack.

54
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,235
It's good for you to know that.

55
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,529
And she's a good mother
for teaching you that.

56
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,447
You've got a head start on most kids.

57
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,992
You're actually very lucky.

[theme music playing]

61
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,432
So, I stopped at a Jack in the Box,
on the way here,

62
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:48,645
and the girl behind the counter said,
"Hiya! Are you having an awesome day?"

63
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,732
Not, "How are you doing today?"
No. "Are you having an awesome day?"

64
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,319
Which is pretty shitty because it puts
the onus on me to disagree with her,

65
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:00,615
like if I'm not having an "awesome day,"
suddenly I'm the negative one.

66
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,952
Usually, when people ask how I'm doing,
the real answer is I'm doing shitty,

67
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,286
but I can't say I'm doing shitty

68
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,413
because I don't have a good reason
to be doing shitty.

69
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,875
So if I say, "I'm doing shitty,"
then they say, "Why? What's wrong?"

70
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,628
And I have to be like,
"I don't know, all of it?"

71
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:18,591
So instead, when people ask how I'm doing,
I usually say, "I am doing so great."

72
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,053
But when this girl at the Jack in the Box
asked me if I was having an awesome day,

73
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,806
I thought, well, today
I'm actually allowed to feel shitty,

74
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,518
today I have a good reason,
so I said to her, "Well, my mom died."

75
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,895
And she immediately burst into tears.

76
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,731
So, now I have to comfort her,
which is annoying,

77
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,109
and meanwhile, there's a line
of people forming behind me,

78
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,027
who are all giving me
these real judgy looks

79
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,779
because I made
the Jack in the Box girl cry.

80
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,532
And she's bawling, and she's saying,
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"

81
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,325
and I'm like, "It's fine. It's fine.

82
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,745
I mean, it's not fine,
but, you know, it's... fine.

83
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,914
And I would like to order
a Double Jack Meal,

84
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,416
and I've kinda got somewhere to be,

85
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,085
so maybe less with the crying
and more with the frying, huh?"

86
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,879
[inhales] And the girl apologizes, again,

87
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,215
and she offers me a free churro
with my meal.

88
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,635
And as I'm leaving,
I think, "I just got a free churro

89
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,345
because my mom died."

90
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,598

you get a free churro.

154

Here's a story.

155
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,211
When I was a teenager,

156
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,007
I performed a comedy routine
for my high school talent show.

157
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,134
There was this cool jacket
that I wanted to wear

158
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,178
because it would make me
look like Albert Brooks.

159
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,221
For months, I saved up for this jacket,

160
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,600
but when I finally had enough,
I went to the store and it was gone.

161
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,728
They had just sold it to someone else.
So, I went home and I told my mother.

162
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,062
She said, "Let that be a lesson.

163
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,690
That's the good
that comes from wanting things."

164
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,775
She was really good
at dispensing life lessons,

165
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,612
that always seemed to circle back
to everything being my fault.

166
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,074
But then, on the day of the talent show,
my mother had a surprise for me.

167
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,784
She had bought me the jacket.

168
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,455
Even though she didn't know how to say it,
I knew this meant that she loved me.

169
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,999
Now, that's a good story about my mother.

170
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,752
It's not true,
but it's a good story, right?

171
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,171
I stole it from an episode of <i>Maude </i>I saw
when i was a kid,

172
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,881
where she talks about her father.

173
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,717
I remember when I saw it,
thinking that's the kind of story

174
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,094
I want to tell
about my parents when they die.

175
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,180
But I don't have any stories like that.

176
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,350
All I know about being good
I learned from TV.

177
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,561
And in TV, flawed characters
are constantly showing people they care

178
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,271
with these surprising grand gestures.

179
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,983
And I think that part of me
still believes that's what love is.

180
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,903
But in real life,
the big gesture isn't enough.

181
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,697
You need to be consistent,
you need to be dependably good.

182
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,700
You can't just screw everything up,
and then take a boat out into the ocean

183
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,453
to save your best friend,
or solve a mystery, and fly to Kansas.

184
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,249
You need to do it every day,
which is so... hard.

185
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,043
When you're a kid, you convince yourself

186
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,379
that maybe the grand gesture
could be enough.

187
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,006
That even though your parents
aren't what you need them to be,

188
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,092
over and over and over again,

189
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:15,221
at any moment they might surprise you,
with something... wonderful.

190
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,265
I kept waiting for that, the proof,

191
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,684
that even though my mother
was a hard woman,

192
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,520
deep down, she loved me
and cared about me

193
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,105
and wanted me to know

194
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,440
that I made her life
a little bit brighter.

195
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,277
Even now, I find myself waiting.

196
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,780
Hey, Mom, knock once if you love me
and care about me,

197
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,283
and want me to know I made your life
a little bit brighter.

198
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,285
[owl chirping]

199
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,997
My mother did not go <i>gentle</i>
into that good night.

200
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,959
She went clawing and fighting
and thrashing, hence the face.

201
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,794
-[groaning]
-[mourners gasping]

202
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,212
If you'd seen her,

203
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,715
I swear to God the only thing
you'd be thinking about right now

204
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,301
is that I am nailing this impression.

205
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,261
-[woman clears her throat]
-[chairs squeak]

206
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,638
I was in the hospital with her
those last moments,

207
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,684
and they were truly horrifying,
full of nonsensical screams and cries,

208
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,187
but there was this moment,
this one instant of strange calm,

209
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,566
where she looked in my direction
and said, "I see you."

210
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,069
That's the last thing she said to me.
"I see you."

211
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:16,032
Not a statement of judgment
or disappointment, just acceptance

212
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,243
and the simple recognition
of another person in a room.

213
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,705
"Hello, there. You are a person.
And I see you."

214
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,041
Let me tell you,

215
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,001
it's a weird thing to feel
at 54 years old,

216
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,754
that for the first time in your life
your mother sees you.

217
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,298
It's an odd realization that it's
the thing you've been missing,

218
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,092
the only thing you wanted all along,
to be seen.

219
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,511
And it doesn't feel like a relief,
to finally be seen.

220
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,555
It feels mean, like,

221
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,891
"Oh, it turns out that you knew
what I wanted,

222
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,727
and you waited until the very last moment
to give it to me."

223
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,312
I was prepared for more cruelty.

224
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,689
I was sure that she would get
in one final zinger,

225
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,026
about how I let her down,
and about how I was fat and stupid,

226
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,779
and too tall to be
an effective Lindy-hopper.

227
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,157
How I was needy and a burden
and an embarrassment.

228
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,453
All that I was ready for.
I was not ready for "I see you."

229
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,873
Only my mother would be lousy enough
to swipe me

230
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,125
with a moment of connection
on her way out.

231
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,213
But maybe I'm giving her too much credit.
Maybe it wasn't about connection.

232
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:17,802
Maybe it was a... Maybe it was
an "I see you," like, "I see you."

233
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,845
Like, "You might have the rest
of the world fooled,

234
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,681
but I know exactly who you are."

235
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,224
That's more my mom's speed.

236
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,561
Or maybe she just literally meant
"I see you.

237
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,606
You are an object
that has entered my field of vision."

238
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,192
She was out of it at the end,
so maybe it's dumb

239
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,985
to try to attribute it to anything.

240
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,904
-[woman sighs]
-Back in the 90s,

241
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,824
I was in a very famous TV Show
called <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

242
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,535
-[man coughs]
-Please hold your applause.

243
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,912
And I remember one time, a fan asked me,

244
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,747
"Hey, um, you know that episode

245
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,708
where the horse has to give Ethan
a pep talk,

246
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,836
after Ethan finds out his crush
only asked him to the dance

247
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,547
because her friends were having
a dorkiest date contest?

248
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,257
In all the shots of the horse,

249
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,009
you can see a paper coffee cup
on the kitchen counter,

250
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,263
but in the shots of Ethan,
the coffee cup's missing.

251
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,682
Was that because the show
was making a statement,

252
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,059
about the fluctuant subjectivity of memory

253
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,104
and how even two people
can experience the same moment

254
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,314
in entirely different ways?

255
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,942
And I didn't have the heart to be, like,

256
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:19,572
"No, man, some crew guy
just left their coffee cup in the shot."

257
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,450
So instead, I was, like... "Yeah."

258
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,286
And maybe this is like that coffee cup.

259
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:29,457
Maybe, we're dumb to try to pin
significance onto every little thing.

260
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,669
Maybe, when someone says,
"I see you," it just means, "I see you."

261
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,089
Then again, it's possible
she wasn't even talking to me.

262
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,967
Because, if I'm being honest,
she wasn't really looking at me,

263
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,678
she was looking past me.
There was nobody else in the room.

264
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,555
I think she was talking to me,
but, honestly,

265
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,266
she was so far gone at that point,
who knows what she was seeing.

266
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,768
Who were you talking to, Mom?

267
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,728
[sighs]

268
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,105
Not saying, huh? Staying mum?

269
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,648
No rimshot there?

270
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,734
God, whatever I'm paying you,
it's too much.

271
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,195
Maybe, she saw my dad.

272
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,948
My dad died about ten years ago
of injuries he sustained during a duel.

273
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,951
When your father dies,
you ask yourself a lot of questions.

274
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,788
Questions like,
"Wait, did you say he died in a duel?"

275
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,998
and "Who dies in a duel?"

276
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,291
The whole thing was so stupid.

277
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,002
Dad spent his entire life
writing this book,

278
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,129
but he couldn't get any stores
to carry it,

279
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,881
or any newspapers to review it.

280
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,259
Finally, I guess this one newspaper
thought he was pretty hilarious,

281
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,929
because they ran a review
and tore him to shreds.

282
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,597
So, my father, ever the Proud Mary,

283
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,600
decided he would not stand
for this besmirchment of his honor.

284
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,937
He claimed the critic didn't understand
what it meant to be a man,

285
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,398
so he demanded satisfaction
in the form of pistols at dawn.

286
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,902
He wrote the paper, this letter,
saying anyone who didn't like his book,

287
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,112
he would challenge to a duel,
anyone in the world.

288
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,241
He'd even pay for airfare
to San Francisco and a night in a hotel.

289
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,910
Well, eventually this found its way
to some kook in Montana,

290
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,454
who was as batshit as he was
and took him up on the offer.

291
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,458
They met at Golden Gate Park and agreed:
ten paces, then shoot.

292
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,293
But in the middle of the ten paces,

293
00:13:56,377 --> 00:14:00,005
Dad turned to ask the guy if he'd actually
read the book and what he thought,

294
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,799
but, not looking where he was going,

295
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,844
tripped over an exposed root
and bashed his head on a rock.

296
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,053
[murmur]

297
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,305
I wish I'd known to go
to Jack in the Box then.

298
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,724
I could have gotten a free churro.
It would've been nice

299
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,936
to have something to show for being
the son of Butterscotch Horseman.

300
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,772
My darling mother gave the eulogy.

301
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,068
My entire life I never heard her say
a kind word to or about my father,

302
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,528
but at his funeral she said,

303
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,823
"My husband is dead,
and everything is worse now."

304
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,740
[clearing throat]

305
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,661
"My husband is dead,
and everything is worse now."

306
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,123
I don't know why she said that.
Maybe she felt that's the kind of thing

307
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,624
you're supposed to say at a funeral.

308
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,544
Maybe she hoped one day
someone would say that about her.

309
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,130
"My mother is dead,
and everything is worse now."

310
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,008
Or maybe she knew
that he had frittered away

311
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,719
all her inheritance,
and replaced it with crippling debt,

312
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,971
which is a pretty shitty thing
to leave your widow with.

313
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,725
"Bad news, you lost a husband,
but don't worry, you also lost the house!"

314
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,311
Maybe Mom knew she'd have to sell
all her fancy jewelry

315
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,312
and move into a home.

316
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,397
Maybe that's what she meant by
"everything is worse."

317
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,982
Is that what you meant, Mom?

318
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,693
I gotta say,
I'm really carrying this double act.

319
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,821
At least with Penn and Teller,
the quiet one does card tricks.

320
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,907
Hey, piano man,
when I say something funny to my mom,

321
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,533
how about you give me a rimshot?

322
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,410
-[rimshot plays]
-Yeah, but not now.

323
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,996
When I say something funny. Like, okay.

324
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,750
What's the difference between my mother
and a disruptive expulsion of germs?

325
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,961
One's a coughin' fit
and the other fits a coffin!

326
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,048
-That's an example of a funny thing.
-[rimshot plays]

327
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,257
Thank you. Let's try again.

328
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,844
Hey, Mom. What's the difference between
my mother and a bunch of Easter eggs?

329
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,182
One gets carried in a basket,
the other gets buried in a casket!

330
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,059
-[rimshot plays]
-Ready for one more? Last one.

331
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,436
What's the difference
between a first-year lit major

332
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,313
and my mother, Beatrice Horseman?

333
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:44,652
One is decently read,
and the other's a huge bitch!

334
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,819
-[woman gasps]
-[murmers]

335
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,696
Might have gone a little too far
with that one.

336
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,200
That one might have been a little too
"my mom's a huge bitch" for the room.

337
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,744
I'm sorry, Mother.
You're not a huge bitch.

338
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,331
You were a huge bitch...
and now you're dead.

339
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,248
[woman sighs]

340
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,126
You know, the first time I ever performed
in front of an audience,

341
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,337
it actually was, uh, with my mom.

342
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,173
She used to put on these shows,
with her supper club in the living room,

343
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,716
and she used to make... [inhales]

344
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,593
She used to make me sing
"The Lollipop Song."

345
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,013
[organ playing tune]

346
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,848
Those parties, they were really something.

347
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,393
There were skits and magic acts,

348
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,020
and ethnically insensitive
vaudeville routines,

349
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,983
and the big finale
was always a dance my mother did.

350
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,361
She had this beautiful dress that she only
brought out for these parties,

351
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,571
and she did this incredible number.

352
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,950
It was so beautiful and sad.

353
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,286
Dad hated the parties.
He'd lock himself in the study,

354
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,497
and bang on the walls
for us to keep it down,

355
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,917
but he always came out to see Mom dance.

356
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,461
He'd linger in the doorway,
scotch in hand,

357
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:48,007
and watch in awe, as this cynical,

358
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,344
despicable woman he married...
took flight.

359
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,765
And as a child who was completely
terrified of both my parents,

360
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,352
I was always aware
that this moment of grace,

361
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,437
it meant something.

362
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,856
We understood each other, in a way.

363
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,568
Me and my mom and my dad,
as screwed up as we all were,

364
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,194
we did understand each other.

365
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,531
My mother, she knew
what it's like to feel your entire life

366
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,409
like you're drowning
with the exception of these moments,

367
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,370
these very rare, brief instances,

368
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,249
in which you suddenly remember...
you can swim.

369
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,501
[flashback]

370
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,171
[partygoers laughing]

371
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,506
[classical music playing]

372
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,186
But, then again, mostly not.
Mostly you're drowning.

373
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,520
She understood that too.

374
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,273
And she recognized that I understood it.
And Dad.

375
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,276
All three of us were drowning,
and we didn't know how to save each other,

376
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,613
but there was an understanding
that we were all drowning together.

377
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,865
I would like to think
that's what she meant

378
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,534
when we were in the hospital
and she said, "I see you."

379
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,079
The weird thing
about both your parents being dead

380
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,789
is it means that you're next.

381
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,292
I mean, you know, obviously it's not
like there's a wait list for dying.

382
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,378
Any one of us could get run over
by a Snapchatting teen at any moment.

383
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,673
And you would think that knowing that
would make us more adventurous,

384
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,133
and kind, and forgiving.

385
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,553
But it makes us small,
and stupid, and petty.

386
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,307
I actually had a near-death experience,
recently.

387
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,935
A stunt went bad
and I fell off a building.

388
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,395
I'm an actor. I do my own stunts.

389
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,149
I'm on this new show <i>Philbert.</i>
I'm Philbert. Star of the show.

390
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,485
It hasn't come out yet,
but it's already getting Emmy buzz.

391
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,028
Oh, speaking of buzz...
[inhales]

392
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,696
I've to take
two of these every morning,

393
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,741
but my days are so screwed up
'cause of the shooting schedule,

394
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,035
I don't even know
what morning means anymore.

395
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,620
There's a joke in there somewhere,

396
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,789
about a guy
who's been to so many funerals,

397
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,458
he doesn't even know
what mourning means anymore.

398
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,419
Let you guys figure that one out
for yourselves. [gulps]

399
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,296
Anyway, you know what I thought...

400
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,466
when I was falling off the building
and I went into panic mode?

401
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,053
The last thing that my stupid brain
could come up with before I died?

402
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,597
"Won't they be sorry."

403
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,559
-Cool thought, brain.
-[rimshot plays]

404
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,476
No, that wasn't...

405
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,770
Would you just... Dial it back, all right?

406
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,481
I don't even know what "they"
I wanted to be sorry.

407
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,734
My mom, even before she died,
could barely remember who I was.

408
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,570
And of course, my dad's dead.

409
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,406
The last conversation I ever had with him
was about his novel.

410
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,783
He was so certain
this book was his legacy.

411
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,451
Maybe he thought it would vindicate him

412
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,122
for all the shitty things he ever did
in his stupid worthless life.

413
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,833
Maybe it did. I don't know.
I never read it.

414
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,626
Because why would I give him that?

415
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,088
I used to be on this TV show
called <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

416
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,464
Seriously, hold your applause.

417
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,967
-[man coughs]
-Well held.

418
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,387
It was written by my friend Herb Kazzaz,
who's also dead now,

419
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,472
and it starred this little girl
named Sarah Lynn.

420
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,602
And it was about these orphans.
And early on, the network had a note,

421
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,270
"Maybe don't mention
they're orphans,

422
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,024
because audiences tend
to find orphans sad and not relatable."

423
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,609
I never thought the orphans were sad.

424
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,444
I always thought they were lucky

425
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,906
because they could imagine their parents
to be anything they wanted.

426
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,949
They had something to long for.

427
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,745
Anyway, we did this one season finale,
where Olivia's birth mother comes to town.

428
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,247
And she was a junkie,
but she's gotten herself cleaned up,

429
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,957
and she wants to be
in Olivia's life again.

430
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,127
And of course, she's like a perfect
grown-up version of Olivia,

431
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,795
and they go to the mall together

432
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,089
and get her ears pierced,
like she's always wanted and--

433
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,009
Sorry, spoiler alert for the season six
finale of <i>Horsin' Around,</i>

434
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,345
if you're still working
your way through it.

435
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,514
Anyway, the horse tries
to warn her, "Be careful,

436
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,350
moms have a way of letting you down."

437
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,478
But Olivia just thinks
the horse is jealous,

438
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,147
and when the mom says
she's moving to California,

439
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,066
Olivia decides to go with her.

440
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,610
And the network really juiced
the cliffhanger:

441
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,029
''Is Olivia gone for good?''

442
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,865
But of course, because it's a TV show,
she was not gone for good.

443
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,784
Of course, because it's a TV show,

444
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,870
Olivia's mother had a relapse
and had to go back to rehab,

445
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,872
so Olivia had to hitchhike
all the way home,

446
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,084
getting rides from Mr. T,
Alf, and the cast of <i>Stomp.</i>

447
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,502
Of course that's what happened.

448
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,256
Because, what are you gonna do,
just not have Olivia on the show?

449
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,716
You can't have happy endings in sitcoms,
not really,

450
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,761
because, if everyone's happy,
the show would be over,

451
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:06,181
and above all else,
the show... has to keep going.

452
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,933
There's always more show.

453
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,728
And you can call <i>Horsin' Around </i>dumb,
or bad, or unrealistic,

454
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,189
but there is nothing more realistic
than that.

455
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,359
You never get a happy ending,
'cause there's always more show.

456
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,404
I guess until there isn't.

457
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,365
[chuckles]

458
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,244
My mom would hate it if she knew
that I spent so much time at her funeral

459
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,996
talking about my old TV show.

460
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,331
Or maybe she'd think it was funny
that her idiot son

461
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,083
couldn't even do this right. Who knows?

462
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,003
She left no instructions
for what she wanted me to say.

463
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,046
All I know is she wanted an open casket,

464
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,757
and her idiot son
couldn't even do that right.

465
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,218
I'll stand up here and pretend

466
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,845
I understood
how to please that woman,

467
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,557
even though so much of my life has been
wasted in vain attempts to figure it out.

468
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,601
But I keep going back to that moment
in the ICU when she looked at me, and...

469
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,145
"I-C-U."

470
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,858
"I... see... you."

471
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,321
Jesus Christ,
we were in the intensive care unit.

472
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,448
She was just reading a sign.

473
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,703
My mom died and all I got
was this free churro.

474
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,207
You know the shittiest thing
about all of this?

475
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,918
Is when that stranger behind the counter
gave me that free churro,

476
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,756
that small act of kindness
showed more compassion

477
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,425
than my mother gave me
her entire goddamn life.

478
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,011
Like, how hard is it to do something nice
for a person?

479
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:30,265
This woman at the Jack in the Box
didn't even know me.

480
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,183
I'm your son.

481
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,352
All I had was you!

482
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,104
[inhales]

483
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,774
I have this friend.

484
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,442
And right around when I first met her,

485
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,529
her dad died, and I actually went with her
to the funeral.

486
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,324
And months later, she told me
that she didn't understand

487
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:51,078
why she was still upset,
because she never even liked her father.

488
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,247
It made sense to me, because I went
through the same thing when my dad died.

489
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,417
And I'm going through the same thing now.
You know what it's like?

490
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,878
It's like that show <i>Becker,</i>
you know, with Ted Danson?

491
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,338
I watched the entire run of it,

492
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,507
hoping that it would get better,
and it never did.

493
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,802
It had all the right pieces, but it just--
It couldn't put them together.

494
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:07,886
And when it got canceled,

495
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,430
I was really bummed out,
not because I liked the show,

496
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,016
but because I knew it could be
so much better,

497
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,020
and now it never would be.
And that's what losing a parent is like.

498
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,730
It's like <i>Becker.</i>

499
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,443
Suddenly, you realize you'll never have
the good relationship you wanted,

500
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,530
and as long as they were alive,
even though you'd never admit it,

501
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,908
part of you,
the stupidest goddamn part of you,

502
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,994
was still holding on to that chance.

503
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,997
And you didn't even realize it
until that chance went away.

504
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,544
"My mother is dead,
and everything is worse now."

505
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,964
Because now I know
I will never have a mother

506
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,299
who looks at me from across a room
and says,

507
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,636
"BoJack Horseman, I see you."

508
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,139
But I guess it's good to know.

509
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,892
It's good to know
that there is nobody looking out for me,

510
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,353
that there never was,
and there never will be.

511
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,148
No, it's good to know that I am
the only one that I can depend on.

512
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:05,110
And I know that now and it's good.
It's good that I know that.

513
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,571
So... it's good my mother is dead.

514
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,781
[gulps, sighs]

515
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,576
Well. No point beating a dead horse.

516
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,120
Beatrice Horseman was born in 1938,

517
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:20,125
and she died in 2018,
and I have no idea... what she wanted.

518
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,088
Unless she just wanted what we all want...

519
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,007
to be seen.

520
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,648
[slurps]

521
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,983
[blows nose]

522
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,444
Is this Funeral Parlor B?

523
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,571
[funeral music]
