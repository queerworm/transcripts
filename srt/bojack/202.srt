1
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,554
So, at the end of the day,

2
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,223
I'm just a regular guy trying
to live a regular life.

3
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:18,477
Remember that time you peed
in Drew Barrymore's car?

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,522
Uh, yes, I remember that.
Why do you remember that?

5
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,022
It was in your book.

6
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,025
-You should do that to someone here.
-What? No.

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,905
Well, anyway, I can't believe
I'm on a date with BoJack Horseman.

8
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:33,033
I feel like that anonymous girl
from Chapter 8 of your book

9
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,995
mixed with the pluck and determination
of that anonymous girl

10
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,122
-from Chapter 12.
-We don't need to dwell on the past.

11
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,416
Wait, shut up.
Is this the restaurant you bought

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,503
when you were trying
to show up Mr. Peanutbutter?

13
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,214
-Uh... No.
-Hey, this table's a little wobbly.

14
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,299
Want to yell at the waiter
and make a scene?

15
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,969
-No, I don't need--
-Come on, do that BoJack thing

16
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,262
where you make a big deal
and everyone laughs,

17
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,848
but at the same time we relate,

18
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,559
because you're saying
the things polite society won't.

19
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,643
That's not-- Ugh...

20
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:03,230
-Is everything all right over here?
-No, everything is not all right.

21
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,315
This table's been wobbling all evening.

22
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,944
If I wanted to flop around and get seasick
for an hour, I'd call your mother.

23
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,906
-Something in that area or...?
-Take me home now

24
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,367
and don't let me get out of bed
until I turn horse-colored.

25
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,079
-What are you doing?
-Did you want me to stay?

26
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,998
No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,417
Some of us here are trying
to forget you exist.

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,836
"Forget you exist."
Classic BoJack. Love it.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,337
[BoJack sighs]

30
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,632
[Claire] Oh, my God, are you Todd?
[Todd] Uh, yes.

31
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,051
[Claire] "Shut up, Todd!"

32
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,552
[Claire laughs]

33
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,387
[Todd] Aw, okay.

34
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,725
{\an8}[♪♪]

35
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,781
Hey, Todd, can you drive me
to get my car?

36
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,617
{\an8}I wanted to be responsible last night,
so I Ubered home

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,953
-and left my car in the fountain.
-Sorry, BoJack.

38
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:46,374
I gotta get ready for my grand opening.
It's finally happening. My Disneyland.

39
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,711
{\an8}I realize that by saying "what"
I might set off a chain of events

40
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,255
{\an8}whereby we continue this conversation,
but what?

41
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,092
{\an8}Well, remember when I first moved in
and I kept asking

42
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,176
{\an8}-if we could go to Disneyland?
-I do not.

43
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,888
{\an8}And then you said
that there was no Disneyland.

44
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,724
{\an8}-No.
-That Disneyland was a made-up lie,

45
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:06,145
{\an8}like the tooth fairy, that parents use
to get their kids to behave.

46
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,814
{\an8}-Oh, yeah, that shut you up.
-Sure did.

47
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,400
{\an8}But then I thought,
why isn't there a Disneyland?

48
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,652
{\an8}People would love it!

49
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,946
{\an8}So, I took matters into my own hands,

50
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,700
{\an8}and over the last five years,
I built my own Disneyland.

51
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,328
{\an8}You've been doing this for five years?
How have you never mentioned it?

52
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,457
{\an8}I bought that cheap plot of non-arable
dirt by the toxic waste dump

53
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,418
{\an8}-up the hill from the old fire station.
-Okay, Todd.

54
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,547
{\an8}-I'm gonna build a Disneyland.
-Sounds great, champ.

55
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,133
{\an8}If it wasn't for that,
she never would've gotten sober.

56
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,803
{\an8}Just finished drawing up blueprints
for that Disneyland I'm building.

57
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,138
{\an8}Kind of busy here, Todd.

58
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,891
{\an8}So, it turned out to be a good thing
I peed in her car.

59
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,893
{\an8}Sorry for all the noise.

60
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,813
{\an8}Got this crew of worker bees
to help me build my Disneyland.

61
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:53,400
{\an8}Okay, I get it. You are building
your own Disneyland.

62
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,571
{\an8}-Literally the first I'm hearing of this.
-Anyway, tomorrow we open the gates.

63
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:02,117
{\an8}Finally, people will have a place to go
after they win the Super Bowl.

64
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,578
{\an8}But you do know
that there already is a Disneyland?

65
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,706
{\an8}-Yeah, I built it.
-No, I mean the real Disneyland.

66
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,792
{\an8}You mean, the one in the hearts
and minds of children everywhere?

67
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,670
{\an8}-The one in Anaheim!
-I think we're saying the same thing.

68
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,089
Are we?

69
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,761
Well, I think it's safe
to take the cone off.

70
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,180
I can do it for a small co-pay.

71
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,639
Can't say I'll miss it,

72
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:29,103
but we did have some crazy adventures
together these last few weeks.

73
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,191
Honey, would you rub my chin for me
so I can remember things?

74
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,193
Oh, um, okay. Uh...

75
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,820
Yeah, memories.

76
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,074
Hey, where should we go for my first meal
after the operation?

77
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,785
It's not an operation,
but we could go to Storky's again.

78
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,080
Oh, yeah! We're finally due
for our free sub.

79
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:51,541
"Storky's,
where your 81st sandwich is free."

80
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,920
We've been there 80 times?
It just opened last month.

81
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,715
Yeah, but you love it, so whenever
you suggest it, I always say yes.

82
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,384
Yeah, but 80 times?

83
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,346
Well, that'll be $6000.

84
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,267
Good thing you're getting
a free sandwich, huh?

85
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,271
What the...?

86
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,899
Huh?

87
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:20,320
Okay, you guys. [yells]
You vultures are killing me!

88
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,948
I'm sure he's talking about
other vultures.

89
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,535
Ah, the Valley.

90
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,413
Because sometimes you wanna go
where no one knows your name.

91
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:34,417
-[Pinky] BoJack Horseman!
-Pinky? Hey, how are you?

92
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,003
[stammers]

93
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,296
Oh, great!

94
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,173
-How's the book biz?
-Who knows?

95
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:43,218
I jumped off that burning ship.
Print media? What a joke.

96
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,471
Now I got a job
in broadcast network television,

97
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:50,892
a booming industry
with nowhere to go but up.

98
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,227
Oh, God.

99
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,980
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, my boss loves this place.

100
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,149
Do you know Wanda Pierce?

101
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,235
Wanda just got named head
of programming at MBN.

102
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,653
We're here to celebrate.

103
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,781
Well, that and she just woke up
from a 30-year coma.

104
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,201
Wait, she just got out
of a 30-year coma

105
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,453
and she's the head of programming
at a major broadcast network?

106
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:14,666
She's been with the company 30 years.
Everyone above her kept getting fired.

107
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,085
Besides, she's got
some really fresh ideas.

108
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,047
I am really feeling
<i>The Kirk Cameron Show.</i>

109
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,091
I don't even need a pilot.
Let's just order 22 episodes.

110
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,595
How about a new show
where celebrities try to guess

111
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,348
whether or not people have talent?

112
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,058
We'll air it three nights a week.

113
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,309
[all gasp]

114
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:36,271
Okay, what if we got relevant superstar
David Copperfield

115
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:39,691
to make
the World Trade Center disappear?

116
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,111
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

117
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,531
but David Copperfield really isn't
a big draw anymore.

118
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,034
Actually, everything feels fresh

119
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,661
if you just forget
the last 30 years ever happened.

120
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,871
Huh.

121
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,664
[woman over PA]
<i>And here's a special request.</i>

122
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,124
<i>I've never even heard of this song,</i>

123
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,086
<i>but let's give it a spin:</i>
<i>"Special Feeling."</i>

124
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,756
Wanda, meet
the one and only BoJack Horseman.

125
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,299
-Who?
-BoJack.

126
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,884
-Who?
-BoJack Horseman.

127
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,095
Is that name supposed
to mean something to me?

128
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,059
[light rock ballad playing over speakers]

129
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,811
-Do you want to go skate?
-Nah. You know what they say,

130
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,689
you can lead a horse to roller,
but you can't make him rink.

131
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,149
[laughing]

132
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,902
-What?
-That's really funny.

133
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,279
-You're funny.
-Really?

134
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,447
Oh, my God. You should be on TV,

135
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,783
[gasps]
which, holy shit, they're flat now.

136
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,412
Actually, I was on. You know what,
I'm sick of talking about me.

137
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,663
Let's talk about you.

138
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,922
[Wanda] Next thing I know,
I'm waking up from a 30-year coma.

139
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,342
So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch,
but it's not ideal.

140
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,137
She's molting.
You know how sisters are.

141
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,681
Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here
with the regulars.

142
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,476
How hard is it to look
before they bring it out?

143
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,895
-Excuse me, miss?
-I know, isn't it cool?

144
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,273
-Like we're getting away with something.
-What?

145
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,525
Don't you love it when appetizers have
a little crossover episode?

146
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,446
It's like when you're watching
<i>Happy Days </i>and Mork shows up.

147
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,989
Oh, yeah, I guess.

148
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,158
Or like when Kramer was
on <i>Murphy Brown</i>.

149
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,577
-Who?
-Hey, you want to get out of here?

150
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:22,419
I don't want MBN to just be another boring
old network, you know what I mean?

151
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,504
-Yes, totally.
-I want to take risks.

152
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,549
I want to swing for the fences, you know?
Otherwise, what are we doing?

153
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,552
Oh, my God, is it morning?
We stayed up all night talking,

154
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,764
-and we didn't even have sex.
-Well, it's not too late.

155
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,849
Oh!

156
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,023
-That was fantastic.
-Oh, yes.

157
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,193
Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years.
I hope.

158
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,735
-Something's wrong.
-What is it?

159
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,198
I don't know, I feel weird, like I want
to spend more time with you

160
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,075
-even though I know we just had sex.
-Oh, okay.

161
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,452
No, you don't understand.

162
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,039
We already had sex,
but I still want to spend time with you.

163
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:03,293
Is that normal? Am I normal?
What is happening to me?

164
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,086
We can spend more time together.

165
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,509
I want to do things with you.
Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.

166
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,677
-Okay.
-I don't understand these feelings.

167
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,890
Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or--

168
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,642
Oh, God, it's coming. I can't stop it.

169
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,646
-Do you want to go to Disneyland?
-Okay.

170
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,986
[carnival music playing over speakers]

171
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,198
[child crying]

172
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,369
Disneyland has a lot more sparking wires
and loose nails than I remember.

173
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,247
Please hold your questions
until the end of the tour.

174
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:44,209
Here we have
Mr. Todd's Wild Death-Coaster.

175
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,586
The name is a work in progress,

176
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,006
but we wanted to work "death"
into the title for liability reasons.

177
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,220
And this is Gabe Jr.,
the Grease Fire of the Caribbean.

178
00:09:55,303 --> 00:10:00,267
-This is boring. I want to go home.
-Vincent, be nice!

179
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,977
He's a little cranky
because he just got adult braces.

180
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:07,232
-You mean, braces.
-Princess Carolyn, stop embarrassing me!

181
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,149
Ugh.

182
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:13,947
And here we have Cinderella's
magical pile of used mattresses.

183
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,031
[child] Help!

184
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,200
Is it a good idea
to keep all those mattresses

185
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:21,455
-so close to an active grease fire?
-Where's your sense of wonder, Diane?

186
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,333
-Your friend is really negative.
-Yeah, don't be so negative, Diane.

187
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,210
-What?
-You know I hate negativity.

188
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,922
I mean, I don't hate it because
that's also negative, but you know.

189
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,716
[quacks, then yells]

190
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,842
[children laughing]

191
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:39,306
-Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
-Hey, buddy. This place is amazing.

192
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,517
It's like some sort of Disney version
of Knott's Berry Farm.

193
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,978
Oh, that's exactly
what I was going for!

194
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,605
I can't wait to get involved

195
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,857
and really spray the old
Mr. Peanutbutter scent on everything.

196
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:55,155
Uh, I was sort of thinking of this
as kind of just my thing.

197
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,576
Well, technically, you did build this
while working for P.B. Livin,

198
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,037
so I have the blah-blah-blah
of first refusal or whatever.

199
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,747
Oh, uh, okay.

200
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,666
I mean, that's just good business.

201
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,211
We're in this together now, Todd,
and nothing will distract me from--

202
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:14,007
Erica! You can't be here.
This place is filled with children.

203
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,137
Coach said he saw you headed
to the visitor's locker room

204
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,472
with a steel pipe.

205
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,350
You really think I'm the guy
who busted that pinto's leg?

206
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,145
'Cause if I am, you should be
a lot more goddamn scared of me.

207
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,650
Hey! My girlfriend's here.
Look, everyone! I have a girlfriend!

208
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,109
Sure. We'll cut there.

209
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,694
The middle of your line
is as good a place as any.

210
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,072
-What are you doing here?
-Just wanted to stop by.

211
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,075
We're filming <i>Hey, I Think</i>
<i>You Can Dance! </i>next door.

212
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,286
Look at you, all professional.

213
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,414
Like Natalie Portman in that movie
where she was a professional.

214
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,749
Who? [giggles]
People are watching.

215
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,668
Ugh.

216
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,086
The first time BoJack dates a woman
his own age,

217
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,297
she's basically just
a stunted 20-year-old.

218
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,091
Well, BoJack's stunted, too.
He got famous in his twenties,

219
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,801
so he'll be
in his twenties forever.

220
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,429
After you get famous, you stop growing,
you don't have to.

221
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,973
Every celebrity has
an age of stagnation.

222
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm glad I never got famous.

223
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,769
I mean, I did write a best-selling book,
but I'm not famous-famous.

224
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,813
It doesn't just happen
when you get famous.

225
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,107
Your age of stagnation
is when you stop growing.

226
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,943
For most, it's when they get married,
settle into a routine.

227
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,238
You meet someone
who loves you unconditionally

228
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,032
and never challenges you
or wants you to change,

229
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,034
and then you never change.

230
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,371
But mostly it's just the famous people,
right?

231
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,793
Stella! Stella!

232
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,295
Corona Light.

233
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,423
This place is incredible.

234
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,633
I wanted to make you feel at home,

235
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:42,053
and nothing was bigger in the '80s
than '50s nostalgia.

236
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:46,224
It really feels like I'm back in the '80s,
feeling like I'm back in the '50s.

237
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,561
It's like if <i>Back to the Future</i>
and <i>Peggy Sue Got Married </i>got married.

238
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,438
[man over radio]
<i>Okay, teenyboppers,</i>

239
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,608
<i>let's take things back</i>
<i>to the '50s, '50s style,</i>

240
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,737
<i>with this classic '50s hit</i>
<i>that everybody remembers:</i>

241
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,906
<i>"I Just Met My Perfect Match."</i>

242
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,534
[do-wop ballad plays over speakers]

243
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,375
Wanda, these last few days
have been so amazing.

244
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,461
You've given me a fresh start.

245
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,880
In fact, it almost feels like
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

246
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,925
I'm sorry, did you say you just woke up
from a 30-year coma?

247
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,428
-Oh, no, not me. Her.
-That's insane.

248
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,263
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

249
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,431
[record stops]

250
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,849
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>Sorry about that needle skip, folks.</i>

251
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,437
<i>Let's start that song again</i>
<i>from the beginning.</i>

252
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,190
[do-wop ballad plays over speakers]

253
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,695
I'm Alex.

254
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,572
-Wanda.
-And I'm BoJack.

255
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,032
It's been really tough for me
these last few weeks.

256
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,869
I've never seen <i>Home Alone </i>and everyone
makes me feel like a freak because of it.

257
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,498
-You've never seen <i>Home Alone?</i>
-I've never seen it!

258
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,793
-Also, I don't really know what a DVR is.
-Neither do I!

259
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:59,088
-No one does. It's just a magic box.
-Wanda, we have so much in common.

260
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,590
Really it's just one thing.

261
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,802
You can't count each individual thing
as a different thing.

262
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,471
That's like saying I have a lot
in common with Kanye West

263
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,930
because we both breathe air.

264
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,475
[both]
Who? Jinx. Buy me a Coke Zero.

265
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,686
What's a Coke Zero?
I have no idea.

266
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,812
[both laughing]

267
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,190
We gotta hang out more. I didn't know
there was anyone else like me.

268
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,360
Give me your fax and pager number
so I can add them to my Rolodex.

269
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,653
Tubular.

270
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,821
[BoJack sighs]

271
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,200
I don't trust that guy.
I bet he's seen <i>Home Alone.</i>

272
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,161
BoJack, I'm starting to lose
the thread of your character.

273
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,956
You think you can drop the jealous
boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.

274
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,459
You're right, I'm sorry.
Call me Snoop Dogg

275
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,671
-because I will drop it like it's hot.
-BoJack, I don't--

276
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:43,675
I got that one! Snoopy the dog.
From "Peanuts." Okay.

277
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,432
I got here as fast as I could.

278
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,060
Where's this next Haley Joel Osment?

279
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,396
-That was a lie to get you here.
-Aw, fish.

280
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,691
-There's never a next Haley Joel Osment.
-And there never will be.

281
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,610
Sorry I tricked you, but with Todd
running his own Disneyland

282
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,612
and actress Margo Martindale
in prison

283
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,782
for some reason I don't remember,
you're the best friend I've got.

284
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:11,118
Now grab the binoculars. I need dirt
on Wanda's new gentleman friend.

285
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,204
No, BoJack. What's the play here?

286
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,582
You'll find one little imperfection
and harp on it

287
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,041
like you do with my boyfriend?

288
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,960
You do understand what my "thing" is
with your boyfriend?

289
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,505
You'll just push her
into this other guy's arms.

290
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,425
Wanda likes you. Why ruin that?

291
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,555
<i>This is Comrade Alexander</i>
<i>calling KGB High Command.</i>

292
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,849
It's been two weeks since I woke up,

293
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,351
and I still have not been contacted
by my handlers.

294
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,730
I am awaiting orders to take down
the American dogs and pigs

295
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:42,066
and other various animals and humans.
Come in, KGB High Command.

296
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,195
Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.

297
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,869
Hey, what's going on here?

298
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,205
You've been served
with a cease-and-desist from my clients,

299
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,832
the Walt Disney Company.

300
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,085
I wanted to make sure what we were
doing here was 100 percent legal,

301
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,045
-so I called a lawyer.
-Wait, what?

302
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,591
As it turns out, it's not legal at all.
Who knew?

303
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,261
-Mr. Peanutbutter.
-We'll see you in court.

304
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,848
-The food court?
-No. Regular court.

305
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:18,978
Okay. But also I'm hungry, so I might
just stop by the food court first.

306
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:25,902
{\an8}Let the record show, this is the single
dumbest case I've ever adjudicated.

307
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,028
-Mr. Chavez?
-Okay.

308
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,823
I'm just gonna throw this out there.

309
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:34,285
Is it possible maybe when the other guys
tried to copyright the name Disneyland,

310
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,663
they wrote down something else
by mistake,

311
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,998
so "Disneyland" is still up for grabs?

312
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:44,712
Okay, well, let's have a look
at the Articles of Incorporation to see

313
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:49,550
if Walt Disney accidentally trademarked
the wrong name. I'm sure these--

314
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,635
[stammers]

315
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,639
-What?
-There's a typo. Di-isneyland.

316
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:59,143
With two "i"s. That son of a gun
trademarked the wrong name.

317
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,312
May I, counselor?

318
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,899
D-I-I-S.
This is unambiguous.

319
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,611
-I find in favor of the defendant.
-Aw, shit.

320
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,197
-You're the defendant.
-Aw, sweet!

321
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,993
Your Otter, this is a gross miscarriage
of justice.

322
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,912
Hooray! Gross miscarriage!

323
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:27,129
And that's how I turned my dream into
what I call "The Happiest Place On Urf."

324
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,633
Urf is a made-up magical kingdom
I added to the Disney canon.

325
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,261
-Americans, they like this theme park?
-Oh, they love it.

326
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,472
It represents everything
America stands for.

327
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,849
<i>Da.</i>

328
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,434
-I mean, yeah.
-We did it, buddy!

329
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,603
Actually, I did it.

330
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:49,027
I had the idea to build a park,
I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.

331
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:54,407
-Well, there's no "i" in "team," right?
-But there is an "i" in "Disneyland."

332
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:00,329
And unlike that other Disneyland,
this Disneyland only has one "i".

333
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,664
What are you saying?

334
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,500
You're not welcome
at my theme park anymore.

335
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:09,547
There's only room for one goofy dog there
and his name is Pluto.

336
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,924
Todd, no.

337
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,844
I've told the bees
if they see you to sting you on sight.

338
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:19,599
You understand. It's nothing personal.
It's just good business.

339
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,060
And that's how we do business on Urf.

340
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,397
-I don't like you like this.
-I learned it from you.

341
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,608
If I could get everyone's attention.

342
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,778
You're probably wondering
why I invited you all here tonight.

343
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,363
You said it was to celebrate
Todd's legal victory.

344
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,490
Right, but obviously,
I don't care about that,

345
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,618
so you're probably wondering
the real reason.

346
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,245
[Princess Carolyn]
No, we just took you at face value.

347
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,330
We have a special guest here tonight.

348
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:46,667
Alex. Or should I say "comrade"?

349
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,461
[BoJack gasps]

350
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,298
-Why would you say "comrade"?
-Oh, I forgot to explain that part.

351
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,969
Alex is a KGB agent
bent on destroying America.

352
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,053
[all gasp]

353
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,807
-It truly is a small world after all!
-Alex, is that true?

354
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,601
Okay, yes. It's true.

355
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,021
I was a deep-cover KGB operative
before I went into my coma.

356
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,607
I've been trying to contact
my handler in Russia,

357
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,526
but I can't reach him
and I don't know if I ever will.

358
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,653
[all] Aww!

359
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,196
No! He's-- It's not adorable!

360
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,200
He's a soviet sleeper-agent
who doesn't realize the Cold War is over.

361
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,954
I felt totally alone in this world
before I met Wanda.

362
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,748
And then I met all of you, my friends.

363
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,500
But if you're gonna kick me to the curb

364
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,003
just because I think
you're all capitalist swine

365
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,380
and want to see your way
of life destroyed, well, so be it.

366
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:38,177
-Or should I say, So-vi-et.
-Oh! Cute. Wordplay.

367
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,681
-That's not even good wordplay.
-Wait, how did you know all this?

368
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,768
-BoJack, were you spying on him?
-He is literally a spy

369
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,604
trying to destroy America,
the country we all live in.

370
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,897
How am I the bad guy here?

371
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:54,068
BoJack, I am really bumping on
the whole you-not-liking-Alex of it all.

372
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,654
-You told me you were going to drop it.
-Yeah, but--

373
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,322
I don't care about Alex.

374
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,574
I want to know what happened
to the amazing guy

375
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,953
I spent the last few days with,
because if this is who you are,

376
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,496
I don't think I like it.

377
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,874
Alex, would you take me back
to my sister's place?

378
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,751
Sure thing, Wanda.
And I can get you there fast

379
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,378
because I'm always Russian.

380
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,546
[all] Aww!

381
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,755
Seriously?

382
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,094
[BoJack sighs]
[Princess Carolyn gasps]

383
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:23,263
I got here as fast as I could.
Where's the next Dakota Fa--?

384
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,974
Oh, I get what happened.

385
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,144
Could you get me a beer from the fridge?
I didn't want to stand up.

386
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,437
Wait, no. I don't deserve beer.

387
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,315
You called me all the way over here
to not get you a beer?

388
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,736
Why do I always do this?
I push away everyone I care about.

389
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,905
Oh, do you? I never noticed that.

390
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,782
Look, you obviously really care
about this girl

391
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,451
and that scares you,
so you sabotage yourself.

392
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,413
That's my problem.
I'm too good at sabotage.

393
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:51,375
-Why am I so good at everything I do?
-Hey, I got a crazy idea.

394
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,670
How about you just stop sulking
and go win her back, dummy?

395
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,674
You're right. I gotta win her back,
put it all on the line. You know what?

396
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,301
I think I will have that beer,
can you get it for me?

397
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,344
[sighs]

398
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,098
-Why do I bother?
-Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too!

399
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,807
Actually, I want both beers!

400
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,025
-Wanda.
-What do you want, BoJack?

401
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,069
There's something I gotta say.
When I was--

402
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,781
-Todd! There's something I gotta say!
-Hey, I'm kind of already doing--

403
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,533
I never should have tried
to make your thing my thing!

404
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,621
I just got excited and wanted to smear
Mr. Peanutbutter all over everything.

405
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,166
I should have been supporting you,
like this support beam.

406
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,964
-Or a different support beam.
-It's my fault.

407
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:41,675
The point of Disneyland isn't
to make money and win lawsuits.

408
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,969
But I forgot that.

409
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:47,098
So, these two were so consumed
by greed that it destroyed them.

410
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,600
You know, I came here today
to blow up Disneyland.

411
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,351
-You what?
-But now I realize,

412
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,353
I don't need to take down capitalism.

413
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,274
Capitalism sows the seeds
for its own destruction.

414
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,526
It's a snake that eats itself.
It's only a matter of time.

415
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,903
[whistling]

416
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,239
Hey, buddy, let's just say we-- Oh!

417
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:07,118
Oh, no, no, no. No!

418
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,828
Gabe Jr.!

419
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,788
Quick, Todd! The mattress pile!

420
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,958
Jump to safety! No!

421
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,919
Bees, help!
Your queen commands you!

422
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,261
No! Bees! Come on!

423
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,679
[groaning]

424
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,932
-You gotta-- Over the--
-What is it, boy? What's wrong?

425
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:33,978
-Hey, there's trouble.
-Did some kid fall down a well?

426
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,395
No, no, no! Listen.

427
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,648
He's trying to tell us
a kid fell down a well.

428
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,776
-Let's go, go, go! Come on!
-Bad, bad, bad. You gotta--

429
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,279
No, no, no, listen!

430
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,364
Wait, Wanda, we need to talk.

431
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,575
-But the fire.
-I don't care about that.

432
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,704
Look, the great guy you've been
getting to know, that's me.

433
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,622
That other guy,
the guy from the party,

434
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:57,751
that's me too and you need
to know that. I'm not perfect.

435
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:01,505
I'm cynical and I'm possessive
and I can sometimes fly off the handle.

436
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,925
I'm not always the best
at being not terrible.

437
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,303
I gotta say,
I'm not loving this pitch so far.

438
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,972
But I want to be better,
I'm trying to be better.

439
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,641
And when I'm around you,
for the first time in 30 years,

440
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,227
I feel like I can be.

441
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,603
Wanda, you make me want
to be a better man.

442
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,772
Wow. That's a great line.

443
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,525
-Did you just come up with that?
-Yes.

444
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:25,112
Hey, boys and girls,
this is your park DJ speaking.

445
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:28,115
And as the <i>Titanic's </i>band played on
as the ship sank,

446
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:33,329
so too will I spin one last record
as my DJ booth is engulfed in flames.

447
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,332
[slow rock ballad playing over speakers]

448
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,217
[both grunting]

449
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,271
Hooray!

450
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,527
Mr. Peanutbutter.

451
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,238
-You saved me!
-No.

452
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,241
I saved us.

453
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,244
Woo-hoo!

454
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,205
-I want to give this a real shot.
-I don't know, BoJack.

455
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,166
I just got out of my coma,
and I don't have time to waste

456
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,252
if you're still figuring your shit out.

457
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:24,213
Plus, it's hard to think straight
with this fire everywhere.

458
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,132
-Move in with me.
-What?

459
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,426
I know it feels fast.
We barely know each other.

460
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,095
It's crazy, but I like you.

461
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,307
And sometimes you gotta swing
for the fences, right?

462
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,350
-Okay.
-Yeah?

463
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:39,437
Yeah. Let's move in together.
Let's do it.

464
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,231
It's crazy, but let's do it!
