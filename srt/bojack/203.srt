1
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:11,804
I'm sorry
I broke your expensive bachelor vase.

2
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:12,805
[audience] Aww.

3
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,933
That's all right. I've learned
that when you're in a loving family

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,060
there's nothing wrong
with a little horsin' around.

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,395
[laughter, applause]

6
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,313
[Herb] Cut!

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,773
That's the show, folks.

8
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,275
Now, let's hear it for our amazing cast.

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,527
Joelle.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,486
Bradley.

11
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,154
Little Sarah Lynn.

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,909
And our star, BoJack Horseman!

13
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,453
Thanks for coming out.
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,038
-[laughing]
-Wow!

15
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:38,956
Great pilot.

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,584
We got the biggest laugh I ever heard
with that "gag me with a spoon" joke.

17
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,629
And then we topped it
with the "get a room" joke.

18
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,214
This was so fun.

19
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,757
Do we get to make more?

20
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,300
I think we got a real shot.

21
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,095
And as long as the ratings don't dip
below a dismal 15 million a night,

22
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,973
we could be on the air for many years.

23
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:56,932
-No way!
-All right!

24
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,392
-Your Squirt, sir.
-Thank you.

25
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,978
And if that happens,
take care of each other.

26
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,481
No matter what,
we're going to stick together.

27
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,071
[unintelligible groans]

28
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,874
{\an8}[♪♪]

29
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,553
{\an8}[unintelligible groans continue]

30
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,765
{\an8}Thank you, Tina,
for those touching grunts and growls.

31
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,849
{\an8}I'm Henry Winkler.

32
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,394
{\an8}You probably remember me
from my 2002 guest role

33
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,772
{\an8}on <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.</i>

34
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:27,731
{\an8}-Whoo!
-Thank you.

35
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:31,318
{\an8}But perhaps the greatest role
I've ever played is friend.

36
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,070
Herb was a dear friend

37
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,532
and I am honored to be dedicating
this bench in his memory.

38
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:42,621
In his last days, Herb's cancer
had gone into remission.

39
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,789
He was full of hope.

40
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,250
But on the drive home from the hospital,
his brakes gave out,

41
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,670
he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.

42
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:53,007
He survived the crash,
but he was allergic to peanuts.

43
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,257
{\an8}He died instantly.

44
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,260
{\an8}Let us now read his final tweets.

45
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,554
"I'm gonna live forever!

46
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,015
{\an8}Hashtag 'cancer free.'

47
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,850
{\an8}Hashtag 'invincible.'

48
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,560
Hashtag 'tweeting while driving.'

49
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,022
{\an8}Oh, no, I think I'm gonna hit that truck.

50
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,274
{\an8}Hashtag 'hopefully it isn't full
of peanuts.'

51
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,402
{\an8}Hashtag 'Oh, no. It was full of peanuts.'"

52
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,531
I was wondering
where you wandered off to.

53
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,366
-Oh, shit. Hey.
-Hey.

54
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,326
I'm no good with funerals.

55
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,080
{\an8}When I cry, it messes up my makeup
and then I get really bummed out.

56
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,040
{\an8}Yeah, same for me.

57
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,291
{\an8}Herb told me you came
by the house last summer.

58
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,584
Yeah?

59
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,379
Did he tell you anything else?

60
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,465
{\an8}No, we talked about cancer,
how hard it is living with cancer,

61
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,676
about the L.A. Kings,
and then back to cancer.

62
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,179
-Probably--
-Then I read that chapter in your book

63
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,057
about how he never forgave you
and he tried to kick you out of the house

64
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,767
{\an8}and you ended up wrestling on the floor
over a telescope.

65
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,436
{\an8}-Oh, you did read that part?
-Yeah.

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,648
{\an8}I just wish
there was something I could do.

67
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,525
{\an8}Okay, I gotta go.

68
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,527
{\an8}Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.

69
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,780
You wanna go grab a cup of vodka?
I-- I'm sorry, the funeral.

70
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,281
I mean, a bottle of vodka?

71
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,034
{\an8}No. You should stick around.

72
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,745
{\an8}Hey, maybe you'll find
that something you're looking for.

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,748
{\an8}But if you're ever in New Mexico,
drop me a line.

74
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:08,749
{\an8}New Mexico?

75
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,167
{\an8}I thought you lived in Maine.

76
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,543
{\an8}I always pictured you there.

77
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,794
{\an8}A little house by a lake?

78
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,797
I was just there for, like, a month,
30 years ago.

79
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,466
-I live outside Santa Fe now.
-Oh.

80
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,770
-[sighs] Think everyone here read my book?
-I didn't.

81
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:30,938
Of course you didn't.

82
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,232
Here's the CliffsNotes version:
Shut up, Todd!

83
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,776
Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.

84
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,696
I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunk
of your car for the next few hours.

85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,281
Have fun being sad.

86
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,076
Do you know what you're supposed to do
with our date pits?

87
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,661
Why serve dates
and not have a place to put the pits?

88
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,747
You know,
some people just have no class.

89
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,498
What are you doing here?
You didn't know Herb.

90
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,335
No, but I do know a hot ticket,
and this funeral's a real whom's-whom.

91
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,880
Henry Winkler,
Jake and Maggot Gyllenhaal,

92
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,758
that Pakistani girl
who keeps winning Nobel Prizes.

93
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,342
I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.

94
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,678
There's so much to hate
about what you just said.

95
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,099
Good news. You know when someone dies,
everyone wants to buy their shit?

96
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,976
You're lucky you have a piece
of <i>Horsin' Around,</i>

97
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,145
because this is where money
starts rolling in.

98
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,063
I don't want that. That's blood money.

99
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,607
Well, what do you want me to do with it?
It's coming.

100
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,484
I don't know. Give it to some orphans.

101
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,527
-I can't deal with this.
-Oh, come on!

102
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,781
You don't think Elton John
was raking it in when Diana died?

103
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,827
More like "Candle in the Windfall."
Cha-ching! Hmm...

104
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,582
[Herb] <i>You have to live with the shitty</i>
<i>thing you did for the rest of your life.</i>

105
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,459
Huh.

106
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,920
[British accent] Hello, love.

107
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,256
Hey, Joelle,
I actually came here to be alone.

108
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,549
I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.

109
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,803
I just flew in across the pond
and I don't know which end is up.

110
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,932
This might be a stupid question,
but were you always so... British?

111
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:52,186
Oh, let's get some light in here,
it's so dreadfully dreary.

112
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,022
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure
you used to be American.

113
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:55,981
That's better.

114
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,859
Hey, this one's having a freak-out.
She needs to lie down.

115
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,152
I'm not freaking out.

116
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,988
I just don't understand
why that lady was being all judgy.

117
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,700
You were touching her face
and telling her she was gonna die next.

118
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,994
I'm eccentric. I do weird shit.

119
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,038
How is that my problem?

120
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,833
Hey, when was the last time
all four of us were in the same room?

121
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,002
Probably not since the show ended.

122
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,629
Yeah, I left California
pretty much right after.

123
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,132
Now I got the biggest hardware store
in Seattle.

124
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,467
That's a lie. We're actually in Olympia.

125
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,387
And I'm on the West End
playing Juliet's... nurse.

126
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,640
-And how are your kids?
-I don't have any kids.

127
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,809
Oh, I just assumed
you had a bunch of kids,

128
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,936
'cause, you know, your body.

129
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,896
Come on, Sarah Lynn.

130
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,023
I assumed
you weren't still a massive cunt.

131
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,151
-Jesus Christ, Joelle.
-That's an okay thing to say in England.

132
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,362
Shove it up your ass
with a spoonful of sugar,

133
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,198
you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch!

134
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,200
-Guys, hey, hey, come on.
-Let go of me!

135
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,245
-I'm gonna hulk out!
-Guys, can we just be civil for one day?

136
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,496
-Oh, you're one to talk.
-What's that mean?

137
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,041
Were you being civil
when you had sex with my mom?

138
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,836
What? I never-- Why would--? Wait, which
one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?

139
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,714
-No.
-This sucks. You guys suck.

140
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,758
I don't even know
why I came to this party.

141
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,968
It's not a party, it's Herb's funeral.

142
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,178
Herb died?

143
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,472
You know, maybe it's for the best
we don't get together that often.

144
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,600
We'd most likely drive each other mad.

145
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,353
Well, no one knows how to get
under your skin like family.

146
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,771
We're not a family, BoJack.

147
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,233
We probably won't even see each other
again, until the next funeral.

148
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,362
-Why are you all looking at me?
-You are the oldest.

149
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,988
You are a severe alcoholic.

150
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,409
I'm honestly so high right now,
I don't even know where I'm looking.

151
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,536
Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories,

152
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,331
and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi--

153
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,500
Pardon me. Is one of you Sarah Lynn?

154
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,170
I am. Of course. God, are you blind?

155
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,338
Yes.

156
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,631
Well, forgive me.

157
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,342
I'm Herb Kazzaz's blind executor.

158
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:53,848
Per the instructions of his last will
and testament, I am to give you this disk.

159
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,267
Am I close?

160
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,060
Just take the disk from the guy.

161
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,397
It contains directions to Herb's gold.

162
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,648
Herb's gold?

163
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,608
There were no further details.

164
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,444
He was a peculiar client.

165
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,988
I told him, I'm not actually an attorney,

166
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,530
I'm just a blind man.

167
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,700
Still, Herb thought me wise
for some reason.

168
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,288
Perhaps it is my overly formal
manner of speech.

169
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,416
I bid you good day.

170
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,209
Oh, pardon me. Ow!

171
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,669
Right at shin level.

172
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,464
What are we supposed to do
with a floppy disk?

173
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,465
Hmm...

174
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,590
So, what's up, kiddo?

175
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,344
BoJack and my mom
are becoming, like, friends

176
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,886
and they're acting real weird.

177
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,096
Oof! Uh...

178
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,431
[rattling overhead]

179
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,724
Hey, guys, guys, come on!

180
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,393
There's somebody beneath you!

181
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,894
Jeez, all day with the...

182
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,646
Listen, kiddo, forget about them.

183
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,858
You wanna check out
this cool new game I got?

184
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,943
You have solitaire? On your computer?

185
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,654
Yep. It only took 12 disks to install it.

186
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,697
Wow!

187
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,241
Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.

188
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,911
I bet it's still in his old office.
Unless somebody else moved in.

189
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,788
Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember?

190
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,709
Because it was under tap dancing star
Savion Glover's office. Let's go.

191
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,003
-What? Right now?
-Yeah. Don't you get it?

192
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,838
Herb's giving us a reunion special.

193
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,467
Remember how he always wanted to do
a treasure hunt episode of <i>Horsin' Around</i>

194
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,594
but the network said it was too edgy?
This is that episode.

195
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,139
-I just don't know.
-Yeah, I don't want to do that.

196
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,142
Wait, so you'd rather just stay
at this funeral and be sad,

197
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,979
instead of going on a crazy adventure
to find our dead friend's secret treasure?

198
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,981
Do you have any idea
how insane you sound?

199
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,984
Oh, I get it.
You just don't wanna be here.

200
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,194
No, that's not it.

201
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,155
Herb clearly wanted us to do this,
as a family.

202
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,490
Who cares what he wanted?

203
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,325
He doesn't, because he's dead.

204
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,411
And we all know he hated your guts.

205
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,871
Yeah. He was my best friend
and he died hating me

206
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,748
and nothing I do is gonna change that,

207
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,876
but Herb left you that disk
because he wanted us to find his gold.

208
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,963
If we can honor Herb's last wish,
then that's something.

209
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,965
I don't know what, but it's something.

210
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,220
-Okay. For Herb.
-Fine.

211
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,098
-Shotgun!
-Everyone knows you can't call shotgun

212
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,725
-before you see the car!
-My turn! Get out of my way!

213
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,269
Brad, hang on one second.

214
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,188
Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right?

215
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,689
-No.
-Okay.

216
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,983
Hi, Henry Winkler.

217
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,446
I loved you in that one episode
of <i>Law &amp; Order: SVU.</i>

218
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,114
Oh, thank you.

219
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,699
How would you like
to narrate a documentary for--

220
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,701
Hey, listen, I am so flattered,

221
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,247
but today is about Herb,
so let's respect that.

222
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,541
Oh, God, I-- I'm so sorry.

223
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,252
I'll let you get back to your business.

224
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,466
Hey, Winkly, such a shame, isn't it?
About our friend Herb?

225
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,259
It really burns my brisket

226
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,471
that some people would turn a funeral
into some kind of schmoozefest.

227
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,306
Yeah. I know.

228
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,849
Those other people are the worst.

229
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,102
I bet that woman barely knew Herb.

230
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,812
Anyway, hi, I'm Henry.

231
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,565
I used to volunteer with Herb
at Habitat For Humanity.

232
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,486
Or as we like to call it,
Herbitat For Henranity. [laughs]

233
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,696
We spent most of the day working
on that name,

234
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,908
and only part of the day building,
but still, we helped some people.

235
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:03,121
-How did you know Herb?
-We also volunteered at a, um...

236
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:08,460
soup plantation-- Kitchen! Soup kitchen!
Whichever one is the good one.

237
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,920
What? I never knew you did that.

238
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,922
Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.

239
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,843
Oh, hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, why don't you
talk about how you knew Herb?

240
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,513
Oh, I never met the guy.
I'm just here to schmooze.

241
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:23,099
Tell us about your thing, though,
it sounds fascinating.

242
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,769
Everyone, gather round and listen
to Princess Carolyn's story.

243
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,104
Okay.

244
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,277
Wow, Herb kept all this old stuff.

245
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:35,903
He sure did.

246
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,574
Look, one of those answering machines
with tapes.

247
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,869
<i>Mr. Kazzaz, this is Manny from Pep Boys.</i>

248
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,704
<i>We fixed the brakes on your car,</i>
<i>pick it up tomorrow.</i>

249
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,500
<i>Just to reiterate,</i>
<i>your brakes are in great shape</i>

250
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,751
<i>and shouldn't give you any more trouble.</i>

251
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,796
<i>Unless, of course,</i>
<i>someone intentionally cut them,</i>

252
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,841
<i>but why would anyone do that?</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I'm rambling.</i>

253
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,135
<i>Probably because I'm such a big fan.</i>

254
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,180
Horsin' Around<i> was a goddamn riot!</i>

255
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,474
<i>I especially loved those kids.</i>

256
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,893
<i>You know, wasn't so crazy</i>
<i>about the horse, though--</i>

257
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,187
Message deleted.

258
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,855
Mm... How curious.

259
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,233
How could you like <i>Horsin' Around</i>
but not the horse?

260
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,485
That's like watching <i>Castle</i>
but hating castles.

261
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,196
I mean, I've never seen it.
I assume it's about castles.

262
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,239
-Wow!
-[all yell]

263
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,992
Look at all these old 20th century relics.

264
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,329
-How did you get here?
-I was in your trunk.

265
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,083
Now I'm in outer space.

266
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,085
Cut it out with your childish high jinks.

267
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,794
Yeah, get out of here, dweeb.

268
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,004
Whoa, can't I help?

269
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,299
Here's 10 bucks. There's a Squirt machine
by the garage. Get five cans.

270
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,968
You got it. I won't let you down.

271
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,054
-[clattering, thumping]
-Oh, no!

272
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,598
Your mom, was her name Karen?

273
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,391
-Can we drop it?
-Something with a "K"?

274
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,810
Her name is Nora. You know,
my parents got a divorce because of you.

275
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:54,274
Nora? I don't know.
I banged so many chicks in the '80s.

276
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,194
Okay, Todd, you can do this.

277
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,362
Five Squirts.

278
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,491
You just need to take this money
and put it in that machine.

279
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,327
This-- Wait, what?
What happened to the $10?

280
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,329
[grunting]

281
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,249
No! Wind! Be cool!

282
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,251
-Hey! That's mine!
-[screeching]

283
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,878
-[screams]
-Oh...

284
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,505
[screeches]
[thud]

285
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,759
Why does this always happen to me?

286
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,305
Looks like Herb set up a password.

287
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,932
Oh, this is easy. Try "BoJack."

288
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,769
-No. Didn't work.
-"BoJack-BFF"?

289
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,062
"BoJack-I-Forgive-You"?

290
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,272
Well, I'm out of ideas.

291
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,940
Hmm...

292
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,569
I'm just, like, so mad.

293
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,570
Well, you should be.

294
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,989
You're on the show
that fired Herb Kazzaz.

295
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,866
What are the writers doing to my baby?
Are they killing it?

296
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,245
Are they putting my baby into a car,
then driving the car into a lake?

297
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,331
Topical! I still got it!

298
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,958
They keep giving the best story lines
to Sarah Lynn.

299
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,628
I haven't gotten
a single very special episode.

300
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,297
When am I gonna learn
about drunk driving?

301
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,300
Don't worry so much.
It's my legacy they're crapping all over.

302
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,344
You're gonna come out
smelling like a daisy.

303
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,429
<i>You're too good for this TV stuff, anyway.</i>

304
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,807
You're a real actress,
you should be doing theater.

305
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,808
Hold on.

306
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,393
Hey, Joelle.
Wanna go to the mall this weekend?

307
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,813
Don't you have any friends
your own age from school?

308
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,483
No. My mom's boyfriend home-schools me.
He's a photographer.

309
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,861
I'm going to the Lilith Fair this weekend
to support female solidarity.

310
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,113
-So scram!
-Oh...

311
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,283
Hey, be nicer to Sarah Lynn, will you?
She didn't choose this life.

312
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,452
Remember this word: family.

313
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,664
Okay? You two are family,
whether you like it or not,

314
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:36,376
and that's the most important thing.
You listening? What's the most important?

315
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,170
Family. It's family. I get it.

316
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,840
I've got it! The password is...

317
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,843
"password."

318
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,093
It worked!

319
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,470
Good thinking, Joelle.

320
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,764
So in that memory,
were you British or American?

321
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,974
The disk just has just one file on it,
it's--

322
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,686
It's the address of a storage locker
in Van Nuys.

323
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,937
A storage locker? Ugh!

324
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,857
This treasure hunt sucks.

325
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,316
[rattling overhead]

326
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,362
At long last, can you keep down the noise,
keep down the funk?

327
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:08,700
If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing,
it would have caught on by now!

328
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,123
And when the mayor gave us the key
to the city,

329
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:22,088
Herb said, "Volunteering isn't about keys.
It's about people."

330
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,673
-How touching.
-Good story.

331
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,300
-Who are you again?
-Wow, that was touching.

332
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,968
A story that could never be topped.

333
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,345
Or could it?

334
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,266
Princess Carolyn, sing us another song
in the key of Kazzaz.

335
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,226
You clearly knew the man so well.

336
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:39,313
Please tell us another story
but with even more details.

337
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,358
Yes. That's a great idea, Mr. Dog-Man.

338
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,944
Tell us another story, Pink Cat Lady.

339
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,696
Story, story!

340
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,782
Come on, everybody.
What is this, a funeral?

341
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:52,034
[all] Story, story, story!

342
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,370
Well, you blew it again.

343
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,122
You really are a dweeb.

344
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,415
Don't say that.

345
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,918
Whoa, who are you?

346
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,253
Some kind of magical trash troll?

347
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,797
No. I'm a janitor.

348
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,466
But I was clearing out some
of the old stages,

349
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,844
and I found this transformation chamber.

350
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,554
Looks like a bunch of old junk.

351
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,264
Let me tell you a story.

352
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:18,060
Back in the '90s, the biggest dweeb
of them all was Steve Urkel.

353
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,437
Oh, yeah.

354
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,857
It was so funny how he never knew
whether or not he did that.

355
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,861
Right.
Well, nerdy Steve Urkel invented a machine

356
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,824
that transformed him
into the debonair Stefan Urquelle.

357
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,994
Mr. Janitor, you're standing next
to a machine right now.

358
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,455
Yes. That's why I brought it up.

359
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,206
Now, this is just a prop.

360
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,960
But it represents a very powerful idea.

361
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:47,089
So if I go through that magic machine,
I'll become cool and confident?

362
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,050
No, it's a-- It's a prop. I just said--

363
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,513
[inhales, exhales deeply]

364
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,100
-I feel different.
-Now, son--

365
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,436
Todd? Who's Todd?

366
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,481
My name's Toad. Toad Chavay.

367
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,483
And I gotta get my bubble on.

368
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,653
Machine? Squirt me. Hi-yah!

369
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,573
That'll do, machine.

370
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,455
Hmm...

371
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,083
Look at all this
<i>Horsin' Around </i>fan correspondence

372
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,044
Herb received in the post. Capital!

373
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:26,713
Guys.

374
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:29,841
[all gasp]

375
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,385
Someone already got to Herb's gold.

376
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,469
Oh, shit.

377
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,180
There's a bunch of fur in here.

378
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,390
It's bear fur.

379
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,560
I can tell. My stepdad was a bear.

380
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,063
Herb's nurse is a bear.
You think she knew about this gold?

381
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,941
Hey, listen to this letter.
I think it might be a clue.

382
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,403
Ahem. "Dear Herb,
just finished reading your novel.

383
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,571
It's phenomenal.

384
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,448
I'm jealous. I wish I wrote it.

385
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,451
Sincerely, Henry Winkler,

386
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,204
the guy from that one episode
of <i>Law &amp; Order: SVU."</i>

387
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,706
Herb wrote a novel?

388
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,457
Oh...

389
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,377
You look thin. Did you get into CrossFit?

390
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,962
No, Sarah Lynn, I'm dying.

391
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:11,549
Whatever it is, it is super slimming.
I am for totes jel over here.

392
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,884
It's rectal cancer.

393
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,928
Ew! Some of us are eating.

394
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,972
Look, the reason I called you
is because I need a favor.

395
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,891
Want me to leak a nude pic for charity?

396
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,226
I want you to sober up.

397
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,646
First of all, rude. Second, gross.
And third, why?

398
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,567
I have a very important job for you,
but if you're zonked out all the time,

399
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,319
I'm not sure I can trust you
with the responsibility.

400
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,907
No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow.

401
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,908
[sniffing]

402
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,618
I said tomorrow, right?

403
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,996
I've been working on this novel.
I wanna be remembered for something.

404
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,249
All I ever did was that stupid sitcom
that got ripped away from me.

405
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,377
But now, with this book,
I have something good.

406
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,922
I'm telling you, this book is gold.

407
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,925
-It's my Kazzaz-terpiece.
-Whoa.

408
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,971
I want you to make sure
it gets published after I die.

409
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,722
You can count on me.

410
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,141
To life, huh? It'll kill you.

411
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,561
Oh, my God, the gold is his manuscript.

412
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,564
Herb made me promise
to get it published after he died.

413
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,608
And you're just remembering this now?

414
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,236
Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff.
The ketamine's wearing off.

415
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,657
Oh, my God, you were the other kid
on <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

416
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,534
That's why you've been following us
around all day.

417
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:24,664
So no one's read this book
except for Henry Winkler

418
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,250
-and now the book is missing?
-He must have been waiting for Herb to die

419
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,837
so he could steal the book
and publish it himself.

420
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,006
But then when the cancer went
into remission--

421
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:33,965
Oh, my God.

422
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,425
Guys, I don't think
that car crash was an accident.

423
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,386
I think Herb might have been murdered!

424
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,847
[gasping]

425
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,889
[huffing]

426
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:42,890
What's going on?

427
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,851
Something about a merger?

428
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,691
My name's Toad, baby.

429
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,449
Yeah.

430
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,327
Coolsville, daddy-o.

431
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,622
Oh, lookie here.

432
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,374
Yeah.

433
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,543
Yo! That's my bike!

434
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,963
Oops. Did I do that?

435
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:21,971
Damn. I know I should be mad,
but that guy's just so cool.

436
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,390
And when the river finally stopped,

437
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,226
Herb went over
to a poor little Ottawan boy

438
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,353
and he said, "Son, you have water now."

439
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,857
You know, a lot of people go their
whole lives and they never give a damn.

440
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,861
But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.

441
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,320
That was beautiful.

442
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,240
You clearly had a special relationship.

443
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,325
We were gonna sprinkle Herb
over the ocean,

444
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,662
but his resting place should be
someplace meaningful, don't you think?

445
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,999
Why don't you take this up to Ottawa
and spread his ashes there.

446
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,711
And make sure you take a video,
and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.

447
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,047
So we can always remember
your great friendship.

448
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,090
Everybody, stop!

449
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,926
Henry Winkler is a stone-cold killer!

450
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,427
[all gasp]

451
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,887
What? I'm not a killer.

452
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,473
Unless you mean killer of gloom,
because I bring joy everywhere I go.

453
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,643
Did you mean "killer of gloom
because I bring joy everywhere I go"?

454
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,229
You know that's not what I meant.

455
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,023
You murdered Herb
so you could publish his book.

456
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,610
But we're not gonna let you
steal his legacy, Henry Winkler.

457
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,030
I was afraid this would happen.

458
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,865
-Oh, no, he's got a gun!
-Oh, no!

459
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:23,991
What?

460
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,997
No, I have Herb's book.

461
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:34,585
I didn't kill Herb,
but I did steal his manuscript.

462
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,545
-So that I could burn it.
-What?

463
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,839
Because it's terrible.

464
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,174
Well, I'll see for myself.

465
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:44,678
"The air in 1830s California was fragrant
with the flowers of laughter

466
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,180
and the smoke of adventure."

467
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,598
-What?
-Uh.

468
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:52,436
After he died, Tina and I agreed
we couldn't let the book get published.

469
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,189
It would have turned Herb
into a laughingstock.

470
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,233
"The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy.

471
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,070
Hungry for crumpets.
But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life."

472
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,989
He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot."

473
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,909
I know there's no accounting for taste,
but come on.

474
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,077
[BoJack sighs]

475
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,914
He's right. Herb wanted a legacy,
but he already has one.

476
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,334
People loved <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
This would only ruin that.

477
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,297
I'm sorry I accused you of murder,
American TV legend Henry Winkler.

478
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,090
No need to apologize.

479
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,177
You ascribed a mystery to Herb's death
to give it meaning.

480
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,095
But there is no meaning in death.

481
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,639
That's why it's so terrifying.

482
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,725
It was just easier to believe
that you killed him for his book

483
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,352
than believe that he just died
for nothing.

484
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,981
There is no shame in dying for nothing.

485
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,524
That's why most people die.

486
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,069
I just wanted to fix things somehow.

487
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:45,781
I'm sorry, Horse Guy, but you can't.

488
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,746
Wow, heady stuff.

489
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,290
But let's not get distracted

490
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,293
from what a true friend
Princess Carolyn is.

491
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,295
Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.

492
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:02,048
Fantastic.

493
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,472
Hey. Special delivery.

494
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,308
Courtesy of the Toad-man.

495
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,728
Thanks. Hey, why'd you roll up
your sleeves like that? You look weird.

496
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,231
Oh, I-- [coughs]

497
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,691
Well, you know, I was--
I was trying out a new look.

498
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,027
It was-- It was a dumb idea.

499
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,113
Yup. Whoa! Oh, no! Ow... Ow!

500
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,660
-Here's your Squirt, sir.
-Thank you.

501
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,872
And if that happens, I want you
to take care of each other.

502
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,666
No matter what,
we're going to stick together.

503
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,252
-Congratulations!
-Hey, good job.

504
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,255
-You've got a goddamn hit on your hands.
-Anyone got coke?

505
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:46,092
ABC sent us limousines
to take us to the wrap party.

506
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,969
I'm scared. I've never been in a limo.

507
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,680
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

508
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,850
-Seriously, no one has coke?
-Let's go.

509
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,727
You don't wanna go to the party?

510
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,811
Nah.

511
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,189
Hey, we never got a chance
to walk around the lot.

512
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,649
Wanna check out that water tank
where they filmed <i>The Love Boat?</i>

513
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:07,071
Are you kidding? I've always wanted
to get tanked in a tank.

514
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,698
-[laughing]
-Shh.

515
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,992
-Quiet. Be careful.
-Oh, okay, okay.

516
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,745
You ready?

517
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,791
-What?
-What--? The water's only two inches deep.

518
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,667
Well, that's Hollywood for you.

519
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,546
Hey.

520
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,633
Are you scared at all?

521
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,053
That if the show takes off,
everything's going to change?

522
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:35,015
[laughs] No, I'm not scared, BJ.
The future is bright.

523
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,310
