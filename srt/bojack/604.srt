Nothing. The whole point is
he doesn't panic. Sober companion.

{\an8}Most of the time
I'm an ocean-levels-rising guy,

there will always be invisible walls

to know me.

76

is the thought
that I might someday drink again.

But it's so dark in here.

147
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,923

And I once played Twister
with Bryan Singer

for Andy Dick's early parole.

159

But I can't. And I've apparently been
so racked with guilt I left the door open.

[muffled voice] Help! Please!

163
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,712
Just because you feel guilty,
that doesn't make it okay.

164
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,340
Are you the time I went to see
Lady Gaga in concert

165
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,966
and she didn't sing "Paparazzi"?

166
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,345
Because I am hurt,
and I am confused, and I am angry,

167
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,640
and nobody told me there was going to be
an encore, so I just went home and...

168
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,391
-[groans]
-Why am I even talking to you?

169
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,144
-I need my best friend. I'm calling Ilana!
-[gasps]

170
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,650
But, honestly,
can Ilana even relate to me anymore?

171
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,277
Since she got that
new Sunday-to-Thursday job

172
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,572
she's turned into a real
see-you-next-Friday.

173
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,032
I never thought I'd say this,

174
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,911
but sometimes I feel like I prefer
my other friend Ilana.

175
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,540
Sometimes it's just easier to talk
to a person who has nothing else going on.

176
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,667
-What?
-Please don't tell the Ilanas about this.

177
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,087
I'm gonna tell everybody about this.
I'm a Gemini.

178
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,174
No! Think of my family!
They need me to be strong right now.

179
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,676
Poor Captain Peanutbutter.

180
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,135
He recently confided to me

181
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,972
he feels trapped in a loveless marriage
with Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter.

182
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,308
-[laughs awkwardly]
-Well, can you blame her?

183
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,351
Excuse me?

184
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,645
Every time I get trapped
in a conversation with Captain,

185
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,231
I think, "If I was married to this guy,

186
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,693
I would gnaw my own hand off
just to get the ring off my body."

187
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,611
At least no one in my family
has anger issues.

188
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,448
My father has come so far
with his anger management classes!

189
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,703
I'm sorry, but your father is a hothead
with a little-pug complex.

190
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,372
-Everyone makes excuses for his outbursts.
-[snarling]

191
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,999
"I don't know what's gotten into Franco.

192
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,667
-He's not usually like that."
-[shushes]

193
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,254
-Trust me. He's like that.
-How dare you.

194
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,841
And the way your mother provokes him!
I think they get off on it,

195
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,428
and they're making us unwilling
participants in their kinky foreplay.

196
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,597
Ew! Those are my parents!

197
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,224
-And don't even get me started on Greg.
-[shushes]

198
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,102
That guy that I met once
at that gas station!

199
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,522
-Why are you bringing him up?
-I don't know, but he sucks, too!

200
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,025
-Oh.
-There, I got it off my chest.

201
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,152
I know who I need right now.

202
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,112
No, Pickles. Please don't TweedFeed this.

203
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,239
I understand your Pickle Pack
is part of how you process pain.

204
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:19,368
Wrong, Mr. Mister.
The Pack isn't part of anything.

205
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,911
They are everything.

206
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,789
When I stabbed myself in the eye
with a boba straw,

207
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,877
they all sent me photos
of themselves wearing eyepatches.

208
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,046
And when my Grandma Piccolino died,

209
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,760
stickyvicki was the first person
to say, "LMAO. Sorry for your loss."

210
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:39,388

Hi. I know you are quite upset, but--

00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,477
Are you not listening?
I told you to leave me alone.

-Right, but--
-Oh! You want a makeup tutorial?

-So, why Chicago?
-What?

244
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,330
What's the draw?
Is it the rampant gun violence?

245
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,834
Or do you just like seeing improv actors
who aren't good enough for LA?

246

-Or is there a guy?
-Uh...

No. Guy is the name of the guy
I'm not moving to Chicago for.

-but you should still feel very bad"?

-Go, baby! Go to mama! Oh.
-[giggles]

284
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:20,484
But what if we go for a walk, and he says
all the right things, and I forgive him?

285
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,237
I can't make it so easy for him, can I?

00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,613
Oh, my God.

287
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,409
That is an even better idea, MarciFartz.

Hey, Mister!
Cancel the park and come here.

What? Stay out of my shit, MarciFartz!

00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,256
-I'm so confused.
-[text pops]

324
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,843
Good call, t_chavez!

-You're welcome. Oh, no!

-[sighs]
-Phew!

327
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,944
Boba Maker. Uh... boba make?

328
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,363
[whirs and squirts]

329
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,782
[automated voice]
<i>Would you like whipped cream?</i>

330
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:36,120
Uh...

331
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,914
Hey, so, uh, sobriety. How is it?

332
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,749
[scoffs] Impossible.

333
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,798
Uh...

334
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,760
There's no clear path to the exit.
You can wait it out, I'm doing the window.

335
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,138
It's not because of me
that you're moving to Chicago?

336
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,140
No. I need to go.

337
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,143
[Mr. Peanutbutter] Pickles? Precious?
Possible point of complexity...

338
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,936
Son of a bitch.

[grunting]

340
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,148
...I know your favorite drink is boba,

341
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,025
but just the other day, you said,

342
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,402
"Whipped cream
is the best thing in the world,"

343
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,946
immediately followed by,
and this is a direct quote,

344
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,907
"So, keep it as far away
from me as possible!"

345
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,868
I just wanted to circle back.

346
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,622
[music playing over earbuds]

347
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,041
Yeah.

348
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,167
Don't get me wrong,

349
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,545
I love the challenge of trying
to square two irreconcilable positions.

350
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,006
-Where's the baby? There's the baby!
-[giggling]

351
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,800
Where's the baby?
[gasps] Shit! Where's the baby?

352
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,428
[glass shatters]

353
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,056
Bang-crash, you say! I hear the note.

354
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,560
I'll be right back with your drink
prepared exactly the way you want it!

355
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,021
[Princess Carolyn grunts]

356
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,816
Here.

357
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,070
-You know how in AA they give you chips?
-But no salsa?

358
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,362
Using that.

359
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,490
But they're a big deal, the chips.

360
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,743
Sure, they brainwash you into thinking
they're more important than they are,

361
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,995
but when I got my two-month chip...

362
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,500
I thought, "I wish Diane could see this."

363
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,252
I see it. It's amazing.

364
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,797
It would not be improved by salsa.

365
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,673
[Pickles] Door, open!

366
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:17,137

369

Hmm.

370
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,024
Sunshine, I have your boba.

371
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,859
[Pickles] No whipped cream, I hope.

372
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,111
Of course not.

373
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,946
You always know how I like it.

374
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,156
Is there any chance we could talk IRL?

375
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,033
Intimately, rigorously, lengthily?

376
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,535
[inhales, exhales]

377
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:44,206
You know, what's funny
is now I actually want the whipped cream.

378
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,126
Well, good news, because, uh...

379
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,712
-Hmm...
-I don't want to be mad at you.

380
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,713
That's great!

381
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,924
-No, it's not--
-I know I caused you pain,

382
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,344
but we can get through this.
I still wanna marry you.

383
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,013
Do you still want to marry me?

384
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,268
Promise me you'll never lie to me again?

385
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,769
I promise.

386
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:11,275
Then I guess we could put it behind us
if it just happened the one time.

387
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,528
It did! One time! One unit of cheating.

388
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,738
Comprised of two separate instances.

389
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,408
-What?
-But the spirit of it was once.

390
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,786
Well, at least you told me right away.

391
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,706
-It happened a few months ago.
-What?

392
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,209
-But I'm being honest with you now!
-Okay.

393
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,754
-At least it wasn't with someone I know.
-It was Diane.

394
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,508
Diane, the nice lady
from the chew-toy store?

395
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,051
Diane, my ex-wife?

396
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,429
That's so much worse!

397
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,432

Come on, Eduardo. Hold it together.
You're not just a fainting goat.

Oh, Coin Sorter,
I'd love to toss my problems in a tray

410
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,736
and say, "Here, sort these out."
I know it doesn't work that way,

411

but if only this smart house
could give some advice to this stupid dog.

-[BoJack imitates robot] Go to her.

Go to Pickles. Go now.

00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,458
I don't know, Coin Sorter.
I've already screwed everything up so bad.

415
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,835
I should sit here
and wait for her to come to me.

416
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,297
No. You go to her. Leave this room.

417

-Okay.
-[imitates robot] But don't talk so much!

-It is I, the robot, uh, thermostat.

Thermostat, I should have known.

420
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,226
I can always count on you
to cool things down

421
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,894
when they get too heated.
You were saying?

422
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,230
Sometimes you try to fix problems

423
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,984
or make them go away,
which comes off as dismissive.

424
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,487
If you want to solve this, listen.
Really hear her.

[both sigh, grunt]

428
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,542
[normal voice] Is this mess
why you're moving to Chicago?

429
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,335

I'm moving for me.

-Yeah.

-I mean... I don't know.
-You seem okay.

433
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,304
But the reason I had to tell you
I was leaving,

434
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,015
the reason I came
to my ex-husband's house,

435
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,851
was because I need to know
that you're gonna be okay.

I need to hear you say it.

437

you're going to be okay, BoJack.

-I'll be okay.
-Promise?

Because if something happens,
and I'm in Chicago--

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,155
That's not a friendship,
that's a hostage situation.

I don't want to be mad at you.

It sucks that I have to be mad at you.

This should be
the happiest time of my life,

461
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:08,512
but now because you did something stupid,
I have to feel bad.

462
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,055
That's not fair.

00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,769
And I still love you and...
[sighs] I still wanna marry you.

464
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,480
But you can't do things
that hurt me like that.

465
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,148
It's not okay.

466
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,527
And if we just go back
to the way things were before

467
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,280
and pretend nothing happened,
I'm gonna feel stupid.

468
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,241
We can't just go back.

469
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,451
How can we make this right?

470

Don't just stand there!
I'm talking to you.

471
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm sorry. I want us to stay together.
I want you to trust me.

472
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,003
I wanna make us even somehow.

473
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,506
Even? The only logical way to be even

474
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,050
would be if I got to sleep
with somebody else.

475
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,927
Okay. If that's what needs to happen.

476
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,388
-Really?
-Yeah, we just have to think who--

477
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,140
Buzzy. My high school boyfriend, Buzzy.

478
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,058
Very quick with that name, but okay. Fine.

479
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,768
No, you don't even know him.

480
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,520
Knowing is what hurts the most.

481
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,816
What if I sleep with Buzzy <i>and </i>Tyler
from Soul Cycle?

482
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,570
-Two people?
-Well, maybe we can keep brainstorming.

If we put our heads together,

484
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,991
I know we'll find the perfect guy
for you to cheat on me with

485
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,284
that makes it totally even,

486
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,245
so things can go back to normal
and we can get married.

for that time we cheated on Pickles twice.

and it will never happen again.

00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,801
Also, I think I left my wallet here

492
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,012
when I came to your party
a year and a half ago.

493
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,639
If you find it, probably under the bed
in the master suite,

494
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,601
could you mail it to me?
I live in Chicago now. Thanks.

495
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,228
This is Eduardo. Don't mind him.
He's just keeping me sober.

496
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,147
Found the baby, had a blast, gotta go.

497
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,566
-And here's your boba.
-Thank you.

498
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,694
-Odd.
-[phone buzzing]

499
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:51,114
-Oh, my parents are calling.
-Fun! Put 'em on speaker!

503
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:14,304

504
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:18,975
