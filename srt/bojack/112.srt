24

and I am a horse.

26
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,815

get my joke about the track?"

27

Okay, there's
a whole page of this.

28
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,694
Should I write him back
and tell him I get it?

29

He goes on,

39
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,763
so then I just kept running.

40
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:39,516
BoJack, when you get sad,
you run straight ahead

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,936

00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,575
I want to help people
and do good work

169
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,787
and sleep on the ground
and poop in a bucket.

170
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,164
Honey, nobody wants to
poop in a bucket.

171
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,126
Maybe I do. Maybe
I want to poop in a bucket.

172
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,669
If you want to poop in a
bucket, we can get you a bucket.

173
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,797
You don't have to go all the way
the Chechnylavakia.

174
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,173
Am I saying that right?

175
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,050
It's not just
the pooping in a bucket.

176
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,052
I think it might be good for me
to get out of L.A.

177
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,304
for a little bit.

178
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,056
Sweetie, you know I support
you, whatever you want to do,

179
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,975
but you're not gonna find
what you're looking for

180
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,018
in these awful made-up places.

181
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,938
The universe
is a cruel, uncaring void.

182
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,357
The key to being happy
isn't a search for meaning.

183
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,568
It's to just keep yourself busy
with unimportant nonsense,

184
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,695
and eventually, you'll be dead.

185
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,366
Well, I guess
I can keep my options open.

186
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,451
Great.

187
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,702
[whistles gleefully]

188
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,414
Hey, can I ask you something?

189
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,168
Did Vincent seem extra weird
to you last night?

190
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,962
Well, he's still three kids
in a trench coat, so, no.

191
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,506
We're going through a rough
patch. It's hard, you know.

192
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,508
He's works a full time job
at the business factory,

193
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,135
so when he gets home,

194
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,346
he just wants to unwind
by watching R-rated movies.

195
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,639
Ahh, I thought I was ready
for a real adult relationship,

196
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,057
- but--
- [snores]

197
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,685
Enough about me.
BoJack, you are on fire.

198
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,728
Oh, are we talking
about me again?

199
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,231
We have an offer on the table
for you to play the bad guy

200
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,691
in the new James Bond.

201
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,027
- Ehh.
- I agree. Total garbage.

202
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,737
But this, it's a new drama
from the Coen Brothers.

203
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,282
A western about a one-horse town
and you're the horse.

204
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,784
Hello, Oscar. What do you think?

205
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,162
I think now's the time
to finally make "Secretariat."

206
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,665
Really? Now? Aren't you
a little, um, very too old?

207
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,709
You asked me what I wanted
to do. That's what I want.

208
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,086
That's all I've ever wanted,
and if I can't get it now,

209
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,422
then all of this
has been for nothing.

210
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,132
Oh, fish. Of course!

211
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,051
Why would you ever
make things easy for me

212
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,761
when instead you could make
things incredibly difficult?

213
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,889
Laura, clear out
the rest of my day.

214
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,765
I have to push a boulder
up a hill,

215
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,060
and then have it roll over me
time and time again

216
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,062
with no regard
for my well-being.

217
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,146
Attagirl.

218
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,442
All right, Todd. PB Livin'
needs a new project.

219
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,820
Bi-Monthly Curated Box of Snacks
has been an enormous success,

220
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,198
but I got into this game
to make movies,

221
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,824
so let's make a movie.

222
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,659
Well, I got a stack
of great scripts here.

223
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,286
Any one of them
would make a wonderful movie.

224
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,913
Fantastic.

225
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:44,042
But I also have this other
non-movie-related idea.

226
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,544
Ooh, let's hear
the other idea.

227
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,295
Okay. I was
heading down Wilshire,

228
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,424
and I saw this empty
store front, and I thought,

229
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,426
"You know what
this world needs?"

230
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,094
Edge of my seat over here.

231
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,805
A store where people can buy
Halloween stuff.

232
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,683
Halloween store.
Feel like that's been done.

233
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,602
Yeah, in October,

234
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,147
but how come your never see
a Halloween store in January?

235
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,442
- It's an untapped market.
- Yeah.

236
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,818
A Halloween store
that's open year-round.

237
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,321
- No, no. Just January.
- Brilliant.

238
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,366
That's the kind of idea
that wins Golden Globes.

239
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,371
I actually think the time
is right for "Secretariat,"

240
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,664
so what do you want to play,
like, Secretariat's dad

241
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,418
or his grandfather, maybe like
an elderly witch doctor

242
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,420
who puts a curse on him
or something?

243
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,671
Lenny, look, I know
I'm a little long in the tooth,

244
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,466
but I think that you
more than anyone

245
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,842
would know
not to count out an old pro.

246
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,677
Don't play the ageism card
with me, kid.

247
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,097
I've laid farts that lasted
longer than your entire career.

248
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,350
But Secretariat was dead at 27,
so who we kidding here?

249
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,311
Just set the project up
and give me an audition.

250
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,812
- That's all I ask.
- All right.

251
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,314
You got yourself
a "go" picture, kid.

252
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,316
And by you, I mean me.
And by "go" picture,

253
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,568
I mean I'll make some phone
calls, we'll see what I can do.

254
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,862
And by kid,
I mean middle-aged adult.

255
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,908
[whispers] Shh. No, no, no.
Put it here. Put it here.

256
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,244
- [whispers] Okay, I'll do it.
- Ahem.

257
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,539
- Has this ever happened to you?
- Has what ever happened to me?

258
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,584
- Todd?
- Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter?

259
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,586
What's going on?
Why are you talking like that?

260
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,546
Todd, I just got
a phenomenal idea

261
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,256
for a Halloween costume.

262
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,383
Why don't you and I dash over
to the store right quick

263
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,760
and spend some hard-earned
American money?

264
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,721
Oh, but, Mr. Peanutbutter,
didn't you hear?

265
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,724
It's January, and
the Halloween store won't open

266
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,353
for another nine months.

267
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,813
But I want satisfaction now.

268
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,191
Has this ever happened to you?

269
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,234
Not to anyone ever
at any time.

270
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,988
Ahem. We give you
Halloween in January,

271
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,116
a truly immersive
Halloween experience

272
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,243
for the rest of us.

273
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,954
Halloween in January?
Please elaborate.

274
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,207
Okay, but before I do,
tell the audience.

275
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,543
- Have we ever met before?
- Never.

276
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,296
Well, according to facts,
there's more suicides in January

277
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,882
- than any other month.
- I'm getting pretty close over here.

278
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,969
Also, there's less
Halloween stores. Coincidence?

279
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,598
Wow, I'm convinced.
This store could save lives.

280
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,475
Unbelievable.
When your powers combine...

281
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,062
you are somehow even more stupid
than the sum of your stupids.

282
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,855
- Thank you.
- Go on.

283
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,316
You stop encouraging him
and you stop encouraging him.

284
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,109
The two of you
are playing with fire.

285
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,404
A fire called
Having a Good Idea.

286
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,156
Or maybe
a fire called Friendship.

287
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,076
- Fires aren't called things.
- What about the Chicago fire?

288
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,452
Or Fire Island.

289
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,204
- Or Gabe.
- Who's Gabe?

290
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,164
Just a fire I met once.
Named him Gabe.

291
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,166
- He sounds delightful.
- He was. Good guy.

292
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,750
[groans]

293
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,009
Business, business, business.
Is that all you ever think about?

294
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,302
I don't know.

295
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,304
What's under that coat,
Vincent?

296
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,015
- You need to let me in.
- Not right now.

297
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,892
I have to call
the guy at the office

298
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,936
and take the car to the place.

299
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,688
It's always guys in places
with you.

300
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,981
You know, I thought
I wanted to date a real adult,

301
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,067
but I'm actually
young at heart.

302
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,403
I need to feel the grass
between my toes.

303
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,947
I want to wear jeans.
I want to dance.

304
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,157
- That's baby stuff.
- No, Vincent.

305
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,868
There's more to being an adult
than just work and business

306
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,955
and the tall-person rides at
Disneyland. I want to have fun.

307
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,041
There has to be a difference
between monogamy and monotony.

308
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,461
What's mahumanunny?

309
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,463
Well, clearly we had
a different understanding

310
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,465
of what this was.

311
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,426
I'd like to be an adult about
this, but frankly, I'm hurt.

312
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:25,138
I think you should just go,
just git. Get out of my life.

313
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,805
Okay.

314
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,391
Okay.

315
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,478
Could I have another soda?

316
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,484
BoJack, you know
Kelsey Jannings, our director.

317
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,736
I really appreciate you
giving me this opportunity.

318
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,279
Yeah.

319
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,031
Secretariat
was kind of my hero as a kid.

320
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,033
Yeah, he was
a lot of people's hero.

321
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,911
Well, you know, here was a guy
who had everything--

322
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,997
Yeah, I know the story.
I'm the director.

323
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,915
Kelsey, be nice.

324
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,959
She's just cranky because
she's already seen 30 people

325
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,796
read for this today,
and we are all so goddamn sick

326
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,006
of seeing auditions,
so whenever you're ready.

327
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,382
Just jump right in.

328
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,510
Great. Let's get to it.

329
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,804
[stilted] Hey,
ain't you that horse

330
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,473
- that won all them races?
- Not today, ma'am.

331
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,892
Today I'm just a customer
who wants a warm slice of pie.

332
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,728
Can I ask you a question?

333
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,730
When you're out there
on that there racetrack,

334
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,982
- what are you running from?
- You want to know the truth?

335
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,609
Nothing.

336
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,861
Everyone's running
from something, sugar.

337
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,948
No, I'm running from nothing.
I'm terrified of nothing.

338
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,034
People come up to me,
they want my autograph,

339
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,452
they want my picture.

340
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,246
They think they recognize
something in me,

341
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,333
and I want to be that person
they think I am, but I'm not.

342
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,918
They see a greatness in me, and
they mistake it for goodness,

343
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,963
but I... I know
there's nothing there.

344
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:46,093
As fast as I run,
I can't get way from that.

345
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,679
- Oh.
- Wow.

346
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:51,098
BoJack, I think I speak
for everyone when I say--

347
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:55,144
Oh, my God,
Andrew Garfield said yes.

348
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,980
- We have our Secretariat.
- We got Andrew Garfield?

349
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,440
Oh, my God,
it's the best day of my life.

350
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,067
[Lenny] You don't say no
to Spider-Man.

351
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,318
[Kelsey] This movie
is gonna be amazing.

352
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,528
Andrew...

353
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,656
Garfield!

354
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,617
Now, the pills
will give you nightmares--

355
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,910
I mean, just horrifying--

356
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,912
but the malaria
will give you death,

357
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,289
so you're going to want to
take the pills, Diane.

358
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,916
- Uh-huh.
- Hold on.

359
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,254
A mosquito got into my tent.
What do you want?

360
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,506
- [cell phone vibrates]
- Hello?

361
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,842
Diane, it's Princess Carolyn,
BoJack's agent.

362
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,468
Yeah, I know who you are.

363
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,554
I'm the pink cat, the one
who used to date BoJack.

364
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,348
We've met a lot of times.
You came to my wedding.

365
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,850
<i>Listen,</i>
<i>the Turteltaub Company</i>

366
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,852
<i>is making a movie</i>
<i>about Secretariat.</i>

367
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,729
And since you're such an expert,

368
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,899
they want to bring you on board
as a character consultant.

369
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,650
What does that mean?

370
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,277
Oh, it's the cushiest job
in the world.

371
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,195
You sit in a fancy chair
and eat pastries all day.

372
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,156
And then once a week, you say,
"Secretariat wouldn't do that."

373
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,284
I don't know. I've already
been offered this other thing.

374
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,536
And did you know
there are orphans in Sudan--

375
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,538
You take this job, you can buy
all the orphans you want.

376
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,373
No, I don't want to buy them.

377
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,375
Look, if you really
want to help people,

378
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,502
it doesn't hurt to have
a little money in your pocket.

379
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,713
Take the job now,
help the orphans later.

380
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,048
- There's always later.
- Hmm.

381
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,425
Okay, talk it over
with your husband.

382
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,218
I got to go
get my whiskers trimmed.

383
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,472
I run into walls for days,
but I look hot.

384
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,476
- How's the pie here?
- Not good.

385
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,102
Well, I'll take all you got.

386
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,896
Screw it. Throw it in a bowl
with some bourbon

387
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,148
- and bring me a ladle.
- Mm-hmm.

388
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,985
BoJack, we notice you've been
pretty down in the dumps lately,

389
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,864
but we have something that we
think is going to cheer you up.

390
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,908
It's an exciting
new business venture

391
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,285
that's equal parts
new and exciting.

392
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,996
Another one? What happened
to your Halloween store?

393
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,498
- What now?
- Oh, right.

394
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,374
The Halloween store.

395
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,293
We took the floor out

396
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,921
because Mr. Peanutbutter
kept scratching up the hardwood,

397
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,799
and then-- Did we ever get
the new floor installed?

398
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,216
Uh...

399
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,969
Halloween? In January?

400
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,554
What a great ide-- Aah!

401
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,014
[thud]

402
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,642
Anyway, now we're
all about smoodies.

403
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,811
- What?
- Smoodies.

404
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,521
You're saying smoothies,
right? Smoothies.

405
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,105
No. Smoodies.

406
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,859
It's a mood that you drink
like a smoothie.

407
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,695
I don't understand it.
How do you drink a mood?

408
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,989
- Like a smoothie.
- So it is a smoothie.

409
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,826
No, it's a smoodie--
A mood that you drink.

410
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,538
- How do you drink a mood?
- Like a smoothie.

411
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,791
But do you buy it in a store?
What're the physical attributes?

412
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,793
We haven't worked out
all the kinks yet,

413
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,795
but the important thing is
we've gone public,

414
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,964
and we want you to get in on
the ground floor.

415
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,883
See, that's the problem
with all your ideas--

416
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,968
they don't have ground floors.

417
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:36,138
Finally, a Halloween store
for the rest of-- Aah!

[man] Hello.

420
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,186
Anyway,
our launch party's tonight,

421
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,898
- and we'd love it if you came.
- We spared no expense...

422
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,149
that's how confident we are
in our product.

423
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,735
- Your product-- Smoodies.
- Yes.

424
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,529
Wait, did you say smoodies
or smoothies?

425
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,656
Because we only make--
Which one do we make?

426
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,116
I'd like to think
the smoodies make us.

427
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,329
Ahh, I can tell by your tone
that that was something smart.

00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,666
[hip-hop music]

429
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,960
- Smoodie keychain?
- Smoodie cozy?

430
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,378
-Smoodie bottle opener?

431
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,630
It's a mood that you drink
like a smoothie.

432
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,632
Todd, it is all happening.

433
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,177
Hooray. And you know I don't
throw that word around lightly.

434
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,638
All right. Now we just got to
make sure we focus

435
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,599
and actually follow through
on this.

436
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,226
I'd feel awful
if this great idea fell apart

437
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,520
because we got distracted
by something else,

438
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,064
as we are often wont to do.

439
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,901
Wait, did you say
you feel awful or falafel?

440
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,652
I said, "Feel awful,"

441
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,822
but tell me more
about this falafel idea.

442
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,951
Falafel or fawaffle?

443
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,326
What?

444
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,413
[dance music]

445
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,503
BoJack, isn't this exciting?
Smoodies, right?

446
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,048
Do you even know
what a smoodie is?

447
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,050
I think it's some kind of
an adult onesie.

448
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,176
Whatever it is,
I'm trying new things.

449
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,805
I'm single again,
and I'm loving it.

450

- Let me repeat--
- Princess Carolyn.

451
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,019
Vincent. Well, you've got
some nerve showing your face.

452
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:08,397
- I've got half a mind to--
- No, let me talk.

453
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,358
I had a attitude problem,

454
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,527
but then I took a timeout,

455
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,446
and I thought about what I did.

456
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,573
I wanted to be a big man.

457
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:22,912
But sometimes the biggest thing
a man can do is tell the truth.

458
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,332
And the truth about me is,
I... I--

459
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,042
- Okay, here we go.
- I love you.

460

- What?
- Oh, Vincent.

461
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,297
Let's go feel grass
between our toes.

462
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,257
- What?
- All right.

463
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,426
You're a better man
than I could ever be.

464

was that mature.

- Hello?
- BoJack, it's Kelsey Jannings.

00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,101
I got some news
about "Secretariat."

- What's up?

00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,777
How fiendishly droll.

00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,864
Oh, bother.

and now we got to find
a new lead.

Studio wants to go young,
but I was thinking we'd get

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,998
someone a little more
BoJack Horseman.

478
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,916
What? Are you serious?

479
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,960
You're the only one with
enough grit to play the part,

480
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,420
and we can age you down in post,
but I'm gonna tell you now,

not gonna put up with
any woe-is-me bullshit

with life, right?

501
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,053
Either you know what you want,
and you don't get what you want,

502
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,638
or get what you want, and then
you don't know what you want.

503
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,391
- Well, that's stupid.
- Yeah.

504
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,435
I don't know if this makes you
more or less excited,

505
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,146
but I actually decided to take
a job on the <i>Secretariat</i> movie

506
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,190
as a character consultant.

507
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,110
Wow, so we're gonna be
working together again.

508
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,112
Yeah. I hope
you don't get sick of me.

509
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,905
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

510
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,574
- Is it weird I took this job?
- Why would it be weird?

511
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,035
You literally wrote the book
on Secretariat.

512
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,747
Yeah, I know. I just--
When I first moved to L.A...

513
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,708
I thought I was gonna be doing
really important work.

514
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,044
You know, writing stuff
that makes a difference.

515
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,256
But then you kind of fall into
one thing and then another...

516
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,507
Well, you've got time.
There's always later, right?

517
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,468
Yeah, I guess
there's always later.

518
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,595
Do you remember
the last time I saw you?

519
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,389
You asked me if I thought you
were a good person deep down?

520
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,268
Do I remember that?
Yeah, vaguely.

521
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,812
You caught me off guard.
I didn't know what to say.

522
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,816
Well, do you think
I'm a good person... deep down?

523
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,443
That's the thing. I don't
think I believe in deep down.

524
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,947
I kind of think all you are
is just the things that you do.

525
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,075
- Well, that's depressing.
- [laughs]

526
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,910
For what it's worth,

527
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,829
I think your writing
does make a difference.

528
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,371
Thanks.

529
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,791
I really wanted you
to like me, Diane.

530
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,626
