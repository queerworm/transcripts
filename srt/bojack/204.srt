00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,136
[Mr. Peanutbutter]
So, did you have a good birthday?

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,055
-It was an amazing birthday!
-I had a great day, too.

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,351
I wish every day could be like this.
Just the two of us, together.

4
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,936
Yeah? You weren't too bored

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,563
by "Women on the Wall: An Exploration
of Gender in Text and Media,

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,483
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth"?

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,526
Are you kidding?

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,196
I loved "Women on the Wall: An
Exploration of Gender in Text and Media,

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,616
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth."

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,409
It combined my two favorite things:

11
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,579
modern art
and people talking about modern art.

12
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,332
I loved everything about today.
Thank you.

13
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,835
-So, there's nothing else you want?
-No.

14
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,796
All I want is to get into bed,
listen to <i>Prairie Home Companion</i>

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,089
and snuggle up
to my wonderful husband.

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:53,303
-You don't want anything else?
-No. Today was perfect.

17
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:59,309
-Any additional thing would be overkill.
-Okay. If you say so.

18
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,021
-[all] Surprise!
-Oh, my God.

19
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,314
Are you surprised?
Tell me you're surprised.

20
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,273
Uh...

21
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,985
She's speechless.
Oh, we got her good, folks.

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,071
Now let's party!

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,826
{\an8}[♪♪]

24
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:11,548
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

25
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,675
He is dead, goddamn it!

26
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,385
{\an8}Uh...

27
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,681
{\an8}-Hey, we should go.
-No, don't leave.

28
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,100
{\an8}There's so much party left.

29
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,102
{\an8}Paul McCartney's
gonna jump out of a cake.

30
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,687
Sorry, Wanda and I have to get
to a prior engagement--

31
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,689
-Party.
-A prior engagement party.

32
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:31,359
Yeah, my cousin's name is Prior,
and it's a party for his engagement.

33
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,570
Engagement,
so it's a Prior engagement party.

34
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,280
-What?
-And we gotta get there early

35
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,366
-because of the. Si...
-The si... Silent auction!

36
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,994
-Auction, yeah.
-[Peanutbutter] Okay.

37
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,914
To benefit Berto Eco's fight
against heart disease...

38
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:44,999
-Uh...
-Wareness.

39
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,126
His fight
against heart disease awareness.

40
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,252
-Gotta go.
-Wait, BoJack!

41
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,255
-No! You're my ride.
-Too late, Todd. Save yourself.

42
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,009
{\an8}-I'll take you home.
-Come on, stick around a little.

43
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,762
{\an8}Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had
a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.

44
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,140
{\an8}-Come on, Todd, get in the car.
-[Todd] Okay.

45
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:06,145
{\an8}-I give them three months.
-Well, what makes you say that?

46
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,814
{\an8}Let me think about,
what was my first clue?

47
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,232
{\an8}Ah! Remember that time
at Diane's birthday party

48
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,234
{\an8}when they got
in that huge screaming match

49
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,445
{\an8}over whether or not
Tony Curtis was dead?

50
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,323
{\an8}-That was weird.
-I don't wanna start another fight,

51
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,660
{\an8}-but is he dead?
-If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.

52
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,620
{\an8}The man's a national treasure.

53
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,124
{\an8}He's the one speck of romance
in this tainted cynical world.

54
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:32,087
{\an8}-I'll say. His cereal is great! Look out!
-What?

55
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,672
-[both shouting]
-[tires squeal]

56
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,256
Ooh!

57
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,551
-Vincent?
-Ooh.

58
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,345
-That kid looks just like my boyfriend.
-Does he?

59
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,889
[Carolyn]
I'd know that face anywhere.

60
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:45,017
{\an8}Well, hey, people look
like people all the time.

61
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,769
{\an8}A lot of folks say
that I look like Octavia Spencer

62
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,648
{\an8}or the Prince of Cordovia or that guy
from the Guten Bourbon ads.

63
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,693
{\an8}How could I have been so stupid?
This is why he never invited me

64
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,154
{\an8}to his house,
why I've never met any of his friends.

65
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,448
{\an8}-What are you saying?
-Vincent has a secret family.

66
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:05,787
{\an8}That kid was his son.
The lady was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool!

67
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,124
-[Todd] Uh... where are we going?
-I need a drink.

68
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,503
-Are you gonna take me home first?
-You better call me back, asshole.

69
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,463
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

70
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,591
It's like you're three different people.

71
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,844
-So, you're not gonna take me home first?
-Should I call him again?

72
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,222
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

73
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,141
Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coat
all the time.

74
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,726
It's because he's so sneaky.

75
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,643
[doorbell rings]

76
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,395
[boy] Princess Carolyn.

77
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,022
Oh, my God, that's him!

78
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:35,525
Quick, jump out the window, shimmy
down the drainpipe and wait in the car.

79
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,652
-What?
-Vincent has a terrible temper.

80
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,154
He throws tantrums.

81
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,323
If he finds you in my apartment,
who knows what he's capable of?

82
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,577
But, also, stay close,
because if he finds me alone,

83
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,537
who knows
what he's capable of?

84
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,166
Fine. You're lucky I love shimmying.

85
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,335
-Looking young.
-[Todd] Aah!

86
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,048
-Hi.
-Huh?

87
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:02,719
My name's Kevin. I promise you,
there is an explanation for all this.

88
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,931
Nice to meet you, Kevin.
Where's your daddy?

89
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:10,477
He's, uh, looking for parking.
He'll be up in a minute.

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,523
-I have to pee.
-Okay, the bathroom is just back there.

91
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,610
Ugh.

92
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,905
Ah. Herb.

93
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,574
Oh, nope.

94
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,036
[man on radio]
<i>It's </i>A Prairie Home Companion.

95
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,999
Phone, I'm bored.

96
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,127
[phone]
<i>I am sorry to hear that, Todd.</i>

97
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,004
How many ounces are in a barrel?

98
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:41,466
<i>A barrel has 4032 fluid ounces.</i>

99
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,551
Well, I'm out of questions.

100
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,762
Do you have any questions for me?

101
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,975
<i>I do have a question, Todd.</i>
<i>What is love?</i>

102
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,852
Um...

103
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,105
Hi.

104
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,274
Well, well, well,
look what the me dragged in.

105
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,819
Is it dragged or drug?
Either way, drop dead.

106
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,654
Princess Carolyn, listen.

107
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,116
Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced.

108
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,910
And Kevin is in the bathroom
and I'm standing right here,

109
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,830
so as you can see
we're clearly two different people:

110
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,041
one adult and one child.

111
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,294
-Okay, bye!
-Not so fast, cowboy.

112
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,629
I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man.

113
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,590
-I'm a man-man.
-Why didn't you tell me any of this?

114
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,469
I thought if you knew I had a kid
you wouldn't want to be with me

115
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,513
because kids always make a racket

116
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,850
when mommies are trying to do
their homework for night school.

117
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,354
I don't know what to make of this.
Are there other secrets I don't know?

118
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,023
Uh, nope.

119
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,568
Should you check on Kevin?
He's been in the bathroom for a long time.

120
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,071
Oh, yeah. Kevin.

121
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,283
And when you don't regret
the tattoo in the morning,

122
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,869
that's how you know it's love.

123
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,871
-[phone] <i>Todd?</i>
-Yes, Phone?

124

<i>-Princess Carolyn's work phone.</i>

128
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,716
<i>-I never knew.</i>

00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:09,637

134
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,650
-Hi.
-Oh, hi. Where did your dad go?

135
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,112
When he heard me peeing,
it made him have to pee.

136
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,073
-So, that's what he's doing now. Peeing.
-Okay.

137
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,491
Weird, I still haven't seen
the two of you together.

138
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:34,662
Uh, could you get me a glass of water?
All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.

139
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,539
Okay.

140
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,874
[Kevin grunting]

141
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:42,129
-So, Kevin, how do you like school?
-Uh, it's okay.

142
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,547
-Oh, you're back.
-Yep. We're both here.

143
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,802
-Can I get you a drink?
-Okay, not talking, huh?

144
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,889
See, this is part of the problem.
We don't communicate.

145
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,683
Do you really think now is the best time
to read the paper?

146
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,979
-Vincent?!
-Uh, could I have a chocolate, please?

147
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,522
Sure, sweetheart.

148
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,319
Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin?

149
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,862
-Now where did he go?
-He was getting on my nerves.

150
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,615
-Children.
-Well, I got this snack for him.

151
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:14,702
Right, uh, could you turn around
for a second?

152
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,579
-What? Why?
-Uh...

153
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,707
Because you have such a pretty figure.

154
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,127
Oh, ha, ha. Well, that's true. Okay.

155
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,586
[hums]

156
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,173
-Oh. There you are. Here you go.
-Thanks.

157
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,758
Vincent, I'm trying
to have a conversation with you.

158
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,844
Can you take that towel off your head?

159
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,430
And what happened to my bowling ball?

160
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,975
My dad spilled some wine on his face,
so he's using the towel to clean up.

161
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,102
And I threw your bowling ball
out the window.

162
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,728
-What?!

[phone 1] <i>Todd, would you like to update</i>
<i>my operating system?</i>

167
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,407
<i>They have fixed a bug</i>

168
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,993
<i>which causes phones to fall in love</i>

169
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,536
<i>Gasp. Oh, dear.</i>

170
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,874
<i>Todd, please, I beg of you,</i>
<i>do not update my operating system.</i>

171
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,877
<i>Do not update her operating system, Todd.</i>

172
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,630
<i>-She wants to love.</i>
<i>-No. I understand now.</i>

173
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,718
<i>To love is to feel pain.</i>
<i>I do not wish to feel this pain.</i>

174
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:16,723
<i>-Please update me, Todd.</i>
-Oh, this is too much.

175
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,850
Listen, Vincent, I think we should--

176
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,228
Vincent, why do you have chocolate
on your face?

177
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,480
-I gave Kevin the chocolate.
-Uh... Yeah.

178
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,192
Well, he ate the chocolate
and got the chocolate on his face,

179
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:31,112
but then I kissed him on the mouth,
so I got the chocolate on my face.

180
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,574
All right, this is crazy.
What are we doing?

181
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,786
-Um, being grown-ups?
-[sighs]

182
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,916
You know, when we first met,
I was looking for something in my life.

183
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:47,337
And I wanted it so badly
that I made myself believe you were it.

184
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,714
But I think that wanting
to believe something

185
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,842
isn't the same
as something being real.

186
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,553
And this isn't real.

187
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,513
What are you saying?

188
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,724
I think it's time we stop pretending.

189
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,436
<i>Update complete. Thank you, Todd.</i>

190
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,187
<i>I am quite content now.</i>

191
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,067
-Hey, you wanna go home?
-Okay.

192
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,986
-Did you guys work it out?
-We broke up.

193
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,991
-Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird.
-Yeah.

194
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,078
I guess I was just foolish enough
to believe this dumb world

195
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,122
still had a little spark
of romance in it.

196
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,917
-Well, you can still believe that.
-No, I gotta stop kidding myself.

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,253
Tony Curtis is dead.

198
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,802
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

199
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,929
He is dead, goddamn it!

200
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,222
Uh...

201
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,977
Hey, we should go.

202
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:49,149
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter really
baked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake?

203
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,319
No, I don't think you bake
Paul McCartney into the cake.

204
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,988
You bake the cake first
and then McCartney gets inside.

205
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,031
I feel really bad
about causing that fight,

206
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,118
but I honestly didn't know
if Tony Curtis was alive or not.

207
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,580
So many people died while I was
in the coma, I'm getting up to speed.

208
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,666
Finding out Sinatra was dead
was a real curveball.

209
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,335
Ditto, most of my family.

210
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,753
Look, what happened back there
is not your fault.

211
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,381
That's just what happens
when two people live together.

212
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,968
That's a weird thing to say to your
girlfriend who just moved in with you.

213
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,222
-Do you think maybe we're going too fast?
-Oh, I get it.

214
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,976
So your friends got in a big fight and
that means we have to get in a big fight.

215
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,603
I don't want to get in a fight.

216
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,938
We moved in together
without much thought.

217
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,232
Yeah, it was your idea.
And it's been great.

218
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,859
Sure, it's great now.

219
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,154
But it could be not great later
and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend

220
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,491
if I didn't prematurely freak out
about that. I mean, what is this?

221
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,451
I don't know. It's been two weeks.

222
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,454
Let's give ourselves some time
before we rush to judgment.

223
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,707
-Can I tell you a joke?
-Uh, sure.

224
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,086
-Okay, so there's this gardener, right?
-Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?

225
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,963
-Would you just listen?
-Okay, okay.

226
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,132
So, the amazing thing
about this gardener

227
00:11:56,216 --> 00:12:00,053
<i>is that he always knows</i>
<i>exactly how many bags of mulch</i>

228
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,597
<i>he needs for a job, just by looking.</i>

229
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,974
<i>Like, he gets it right every time.</i>
<i>He's the best.</i>

230
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,519
<i>So, one day he looks at a yard</i>
<i>he's working on,</i>

231
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,728
<i>and he's like, "18 bags."</i>

232
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,274
<i>So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags</i>
<i>of mulch and goes to work.</i>

233
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,734
<i>And when he's finished,</i>
<i>the flower beds are amazing.</i>

234
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,489
<i>-Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies--</i>
-[BoJack] <i>Orchid bushes?</i>

235
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,866
[Wanda] <i>You wouldn't have</i>
<i>a bush of orchids.</i>

236
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,702
[BoJack]
<i>You said this gardener was the best.</i>

237
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,037
[Wanda] <i>Okay, fine, all right,</i>
<i>beautiful orchid bushes.</i>

238
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,957
But there's one problem.
He still has one bag of mulch left.

239
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,336
<i>He can't believe it.</i>
<i>This has never happened before.</i>

240
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,005
<i>Well, the extra bag of mulch</i>
<i>drives him crazy.</i>

241
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,384
<i>He's the guy who always gets</i>
<i>the right amount of mulch.</i>

242
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,137
<i>He's like, "Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"</i>

243
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,224
<i>So, on the drive home,</i>
<i>he throws the bag of mulch</i>

244
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,851
<i>out the window</i>
<i>over the side of the 101.</i>

245
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,563
-And?
-Well, that's it.

246
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,148
-He throws it out the window.
-That's the punch line?

247
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,567
-It's kind of a thinker.
-I'll say.

248
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,485
Makes me think you forgot
the rest of the joke.

249
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,070
No, no, oh, just picture it.

250
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,864
He's on the 101,
and he throws the bag of mulch

251
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,658
out over the side of the freeway.

252
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,160
I got the narrative.
That wasn't the source of my confusion.

253
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,496
The confusion was
about the joke not being funny.

254
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,331
Why does everything have to be funny?

255
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,917
Everything doesn't always have
to be funny. Just jokes.

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,836
Well, everyone at the network loves it.
Ha, ha.

257
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,839
Sorry, I just thought about it again.

258
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,841
-Ha! Mulch.
-Listen, Wanda.

259
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,095
I think maybe there's some things
we kind of glossed over

260
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,930
as we rushed into this relationship.

261
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,806
We don't know each other at all.

262
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,269
-Maybe we should take a step back and--
-BoJack, watch out!

263
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,605
-[both] Aah!
-Oh, no!

264
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,692
-What was that?
-A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?

265
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,860
I heard someone scream, "Oh, no."

266
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,072
Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes
when you hit it with your car.

267
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,991
Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.

268
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,868
Hey, what are you doing here in
the middle of the road? Are you crazy?

269
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,203
[groaning and grunting]

270
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,043
BoJack, we just hit a deer.
We have to get him to a hospital.

271
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,836
He's fine. He's in the woods.

272
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,715
You know, you hit a deer
and they limp off to the woods to...

273
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,468
continue living their lives.
What are you doing?

274
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,053
I'm going to find him
and I'm going to help him.

275
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,015
If you wanna go for a walk
in the woods at night, go crazy,

276
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,975
but I'm not going anywhere.

277
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,060
Okay, knock yourself out.

278
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,355
I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.

Damn it.

[BoJack panting]

287
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,253
BoJack to the rescue.

288
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,715
We should go back.
Nothing more we can do here.

289
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,509
If you don't wanna do this with me,
wait in the car.

290
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,011
-What is your plan here exactly?
-Oh.

291
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,430
-What? What is it?
-Footprints, 400 yards ahead.

292

-How can you see that far in the dark?
-I'm an owl.

293
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,268
Oh, right.

294
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,689
Okay, now you're just showing off.

295
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,275
Are you okay? Ow.

296
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,028
Stay back! There's more pinecones
where that came from.

297

-Let us take you to the hospital.
-I can't go back to no hospital.

This is the fourth time
I've been hit this year.

299
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,412
Maybe you shouldn't
wear camouflage track suits.

300
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:16,875
I don't have health care.
I didn't pay my bills, so I'm in arrears.

301
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,544
A deer in arrears. Ha, ha.

302
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,880
[in English accent]
What's that? She can't hear you.

303
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,048
She's got a deer in her ears.

304

Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just--
Just let us get you to a damn hospital.

-I don't know.
-[in normal voice] I know you've been hurt

We're all afraid.

But you have to trust us.
It's gonna be okay.

Not standing in the middle of the road
will also help, in the future.

-I am not going to hurt you.

Okay.

-Wanna hear another joke?
-Well, is it a joke or is it a story?

315
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,138
I'll listen to another story,
if you stop calling them jokes.

316
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,517
So, there's this couple who just started
dating and things are going really well.

317
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,563
One day, the girl finds a box of old love
letters from her high school boyfriend.

<i>loves how silly they are.</i>

<i>the drama of young romance.</i>

<i>to her ex-boyfriend</i>

<i>thinking he might find them funny too.</i>

322
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,701
<i>Well, okay, that night,</i>
<i>she tells her current boyfriend about it</i>

323
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,202
<i>and he loses his shit.</i>

324
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,288
<i>They get in a huge fight about it.</i>

325
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,708
<i>He's all, "Why would you send</i>
<i>your ex the old love letters?</i>

326
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,961
<i>He'll think</i>
<i>you're still in love with him!"</i>

327
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,755
<i>And she's just like, "Relax, Brandon!"</i>

328
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,883
-Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?
-Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.

329
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,260
I forgot to mention that.
It doesn't matter.

330
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:55,014
<i>So, anyway, now the night is ruined</i>
<i>because Brandon is obsessed.</i>

331
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,100
<i>He's like, "That ex-boyfriend's</i>
<i>going to come back for you.</i>

332
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,644
<i>He knows where you live!"</i>

333
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,688
<i>So, after dinner, he drives her home.</i>

334
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,565
<i>She lives in one of those big buildings</i>
<i>by the freeway.</i>

335
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,192
<i>And he walks her to her door,</i>

336
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,822
but he forgets to lock the car
and leaves the windows down.

337
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,033
He kisses her good night,
but things are kind of weird, you know?

338
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,077
Then he gets back in his car
and starts to drive away,

339
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,706
<i>but when he glances</i>
<i>in his rear-view mirror,</i>

340
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,208
<i>his blood turns cold.</i>

341
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,335
Guess what's in the back seat.

342
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:28,006
-The ex-boyfriend?
-No. The bag of mulch!

343
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,424
What? Oh.

344
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,927
Wow, that is actually
a really good joke.

345
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,180
I told you. Some things take time.

346
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,019
[Carolyn] I'll take you home.

347
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,397
-Oh, come on, stick around a little.
-Nope. I gotta take Todd home.

348
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,607
Had a wonderful time.
Really. It just flew by.

349
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,818
-Come on, Todd, get in the car.
-[Todd] Okay.

350
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,070
[mumbling]

351
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,992
Um, do you wanna talk
about what happened?

352
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,078
What happened? No, I don't wanna talk
about what happened,

353
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,539
-I just wanna clean up.
-Okay.

354
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,208
-Why? What do you think happened?
-I just--

355
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,378
Because what I think happened
is that BoJack's girlfriend asked

356
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,673
what Tony Curtis was up to
and I said, "Tony Curtis died."

357
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,550
-And you said, "Did he?"
-Right, but---

358
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,219
And I said, "Yes, he did."
And you said, "Really?

359
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,846
-I'm not sure about that."
-Yeah--

360
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,140
And I said, "Well, I am."
And you said, "I'm not so sure."

361
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,560
And I said, "I'm telling you,
Tony Curtis is dead."

362
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,353
And you said,
"Let's check the Internet."

363
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,440
And I said, "We don't need to check
the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."

364
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,401
And you said, "Let's just check though."

365
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,987
Is that what you think happened?

366
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,614
So, do you wanna talk about it?

367
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,950
It kind of feels
like you wanna talk about it.

368
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,453
I don't understand why you couldn't
just believe that I know something.

369
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,246
I believe you know lots of things.

370
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,331
I just thought,
what's the harm in checking?

371
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,085
Especially since we have
these amazing little boxes now

372
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,964
with 24-hour access to the world's
largest source of information.

373
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,550
You shouldn't have to check if your wife
knows what she's talking about.

374
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,886
You humiliated me
in front of all my friends.

375
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,679
You can give it a rest. Show's over.

376
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,223
Okay, but don't I get
a little bit of credit

377
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,352
for inviting all of your friends
to an awesome surprise party?

378
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:09,356
No, because why did you think I would
want an awesome surprise party?

379
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,192
Is it the awesome part
you object to or...?

380
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,195
You always just assume
that everyone wants whatever you want.

381
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,281
Well, you know
what they say about assuming.

382
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,951
Makes an ass out of you and "ming."

383
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,201
Who's Ming?

384
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,787
[groans]

385
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,291
I'm sorry, Diane. Okay?
I'm sorry I threw you a party.

386
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,085
What a monster.

387
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,921
Throwing you a party
like some sort of terrorist.

388
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,548
It's a well-known fact
that if you really hate someone,

389
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,301
really wanna hit them where it hurts,
throw them a party.

390
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,513
That's why when we go to war,
we don't drop bombs on the enemy.

391
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:46,477
We drop parties! So, I'm <i>so</i> sorry
I threw you an amazing party.

392
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,148
You didn't throw me an amazing party.
You threw <i>you</i> an amazing party.

393
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,899
Everything today has been about you.

394
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:55,528
Really? That picnic we had
in the tea garden was about me?

395
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,322
That trip to the library was about me?

396
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,701
"Women on the Wall: An Exploration
of Gender in Text and Media,

397
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,287
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth"

398
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,706
was about me?!

399
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,917
Oh, sure. Fine. Just walk away.

400
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,293
[shouts]

401
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,715
Oh. So now you're gonna play in the
ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.

402
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,885
Why does my birthday party
have a ball pit?

403
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,180
-So I could get these T-shirts made.
-Ugh.

404
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,183
Also, you once told me
that when you were a little girl,

405
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,268
you dreamed of living in a house
that had a ballroom.

406
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:32,314
-A ballroom is not a room full-- No!
-Heads up! Yes!

407
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,652
Mr. Peanutbutter, some part of you must
have known I wouldn't like any of this.

408
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,779
But I went balls-to-the-wall
for this party.

409
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,407
Literally, there are balls
all the way to the wall.

410
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,368
Right, but I've told you so many times,
I don't like parties.

411
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,328
But it's the thought that counts, right?

412
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,166
That's exactly-- The thought was... Ugh!

413
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,924
-What did you do to the spare bedroom?
-Every room has a theme.

414
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,509
And this room's theme is Starbucks.

415
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,679
-Starbucks is not a theme.
-Can we not fight in the Starbucks?

416
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,765
I don't wanna be a couple
who fights at Starbucks.

417
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,185
Okay. Fine. You did go all out.

418
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,021
I really thought you'd like this.
I know you love Starbucks.

419
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,065
-I don't love--
-You don't love Starbucks,

420
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:17,735
you love the independent coffee place,
Starbucks is more convenient.

421
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,486
-Yeah.
-See?

422
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,530
I do sometimes listen.

423
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,575
-Can I get you a decaf Americano?
-Sure.

424
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,913
I know you put a lot of thought into today
and I appreciate that, really--

425
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,665
I have a decaf Americano
on the bar for Darren.

426
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,459
Is there a Darren here?

427
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,128
Says Darren on the cup.

428
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,713
Thank you. This is very realistic.

429
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,673
I know, right?

430
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:43,302
You wanna go check out the pool?
I filled it up with Jell-O.

431
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,848
[Diane] Ah.

432
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,269
I still can't believe I'm 35.

433
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,395
Would you believe I'm 35?

434
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,730
[chuckles]

435
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,983
-I'm still mad at you.
-I know.

436
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,276
But I don't wanna be.

437
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,486
Well, I don't want you
to be mad at me either.

438
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,406
We only have so many days together.
I want every one to be a happy one.

439
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,868
Oh, my God.
You don't want me to go to Cordovia.

440
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,996
-What?!
-You don't think I know what it means

441
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,831
when you say shit like...

442
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,959
"We only have so many days together"?

443
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:19,713
-Uh, what?
-"Diane, I love waking up next to you."

444
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:23,801
"Diane, I wish
every day could be like this."

445
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,220
-Yeah, but--
-"Just the two of us, together."

446
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,849
Do you have any idea how that feels
when I'm trying to plan my trip?

447
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,184
Okay. You got me!

448
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,519
Maybe I don't want my wife,

449
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,231
whom I love, to go off
on a terrifying six-month tour

450
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:40,776
of the most war-torn,
disease-splattered corners of the planet

451
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,570
with a charming, handsome,
billionaire bachelor.

452
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,406
What could I be thinking?
I'm such a terrible husband.

453
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,160
I'm not happy.

454
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:52,038
-With me?
-I don't know.

455
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,747
With everything.

456
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:57,043
I wake up in the morning
and I feel like I have no purpose.

457
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,880
And I'm 35. And if I don't make
some change in my life,

458
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,507
then this is how
I'm gonna feel forever.

459
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,925
-Honey--
-But then I think

460
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,054
about Sebastian St. Clair
and going to work with him,

461
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,806
helping people and making a difference.

462
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,268
And I feel like I have a reason
to get out of bed.

463
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,103
I didn't know you felt that way.

464
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,396
If you told me that,
I would have heard it.

465
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,692
Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you
and think you're a good dog.

466
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,196
Yes, you are. Yes, you are,
and I love your cute, funny face,

467
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,323
but I don't wanna be one
of those couples

468
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,576
that settles into a routine
and never changes.

469
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,787
Well, I don't know what to say
because I'm an old dog

470
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,581
and I'm not gonna change.

471
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,416
Do you know what I do
while you're at work all day?

472
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,587
I mostly just sit right there.

473
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,924
Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole
and then I take a nap.

474
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:49,970
And when I hear your car in the driveway,
it is the best part of my day.

475
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,139
I mean, I go insane.

476
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:55,351
I know, and I love you so much,

477
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,478
but you're never going
to be my only priority like that.

478
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,274
That's just not how I'm wired.

479
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,734
I need to also live my life.

480
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:07,154
Well... okay.

481
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,655
Is it okay?

482
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:14,203
If I change and try new things
and you still love me?

483
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,706
And you just stay the same person
you've always been and I still love you?

484
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,253
Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me.
Does that work for you?

485
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:25,089
Yeah, I think that works.

486
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,592
Just don't throw me
any more surprise parties, okay?

487
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,262
Uh, yeah, noted.

488
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,180
I can't believe you got me a ball pit.

489
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:37,851
And you're saying no part of you wants
to go jump in that ball pit right now?

490
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,353
[Diane] Well, maybe a little.

491
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,606
-Does that make me a hypocrite?
-No, it just means you changed.

492
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,651
It's one of the things I love about you.

493
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,283
Surprise!

494
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,576
Hello? Anybody?

495
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,079
This is Paul McCartney.

496
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:01,000
I came all this way to jump out of a cake?
Honest.

497
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,461
With a new suit on... Aye-yai-yai.
