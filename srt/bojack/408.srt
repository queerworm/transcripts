1
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,973
So I send in the form,
and if my mom wants to meet me too,

2
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,266
-then we meet?
-Yeah.

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,726
And if she doesn't want to meet me,

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,187
then I get to feel that hot sting
of rejection all over again.

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,273
What a fun adventure this all is.

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,610
You know what <i>is </i>fun? You coming with me
to my first day on my new show.

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,575
starring BoJack Horseman
as 'the Judge.'"

9
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,118
What is <i>F.H.B.A.</i>?

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,329
I think it's one of those shows
about Navy sex crimes that have gone cold?

11
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,916
And there may be numbers or something?
Then, they call "the Judge."

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,918
I'm just excited to get out of the house.

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,421
I've been getting really fidgety
cooped up on that hill.

14
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,214
Like I got tiny little bumps
crawling around

15
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,716
on the inside of my skin, you know?

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,094
Totally. Look at this guy,
texting in the middle of the intersection.

17
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,139
You have been judged
to be a shitty driver.

18
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,559
I'm the Judge.
I sentence you to kiss my ass.

19
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,560
Boom!

20
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,978
You got "judged."

21
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,399
It feels good
to be a dramatic actor again.

22
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,276
To make someone laugh
is a craft, to be sure,

23
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,696
but to make someone cry, on purpose,
that is a precious gift.

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,616
Hey, I'm Miles, the production intern.
Can I get you anything? Water?

25
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,034
That's so sweet of you.

26
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,911
Actually, that's so his job of him.

27
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,372
-Hey, PA, whose name I already forgot.
-It's Miles, and I'm an intern.

28
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,167
Still not interested. Can you take
my daughter to "video village"?

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,503
I wanna make sure she sees me
at my most awesome,

30
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,422
which is with a slightly high angle
to avoid appearance of a double chin.

31
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,340
Note to director.

32
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,716

So are we judging who has the best booty?

{\an8}Whoa, BoJack, no.
That is so degrading.

69

{\an8}So if it's not about their butts,
then why is the other judge Sir Mix-A-Lot?

70
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,114
{\an8}Because I'm an honest and impartial judge.

71
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:04,077
And if there's one thing I'm famous for,
it's that I cannot lie.

72
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,954
Yeah, I guess that would be the one thing.

{\an8}So making TV is like a full-time job?
Then why is it so bad?

79
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,682
I just assumed people weren't trying.

80
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,018
{\an8}Uh, I don't mean to butt in here,
but shouldn't your daughter be in school?

{\an8}Shouldn't you be
"Sir Minding-Your-Own-Business-A-Lot"?

My friend Maryssa is backpacking

Hey, you wanna explore the back lot?

89

They got a whole area that was built
to look like downtown Toronto.

90
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,749
That's where they shoot the stuff
set in New York.

91
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,626
Are you allowed to just leave the set?

92
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,169
What are they gonna do? Dock my pay?

93
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,547

00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:06,764
{\an8}Princess Carolyn,
you are going to love Stilton Acres.

96
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,268
{\an8}We have a sauna and a tennis court
and a giant hedge maze.

97
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,521
{\an8}And if you make it all the way through
the maze, you get some sugar water.

98
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,024
And you're gonna love
the Feast of Saint Squeaky.

99
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,067
It's the holiest of all mouse holidays.

100
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,402
We prepare a feast of Swiss--

101
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,237
Because it's the holiest of all cheeses?

102
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,614
Because it was all our ancestors
could carry

103
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,117
when they were trying to escape
for their lives.

104
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,535
{\an8}Oh-- because it has <i>holes!</i>

105
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,786
{\an8}-That's very funny.
-Thanks.

especially around the holidays.

108
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,543
{\an8}I'm sure I'm going to love them.

109
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,463
{\an8}And they're gonna love me.

110

I'm sure they will too.

111
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,174
But let's wait
until after they love you

112
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,342
to tell them about, you know, Philbert.

113
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,261
{\an8}Of course. But what about her?

114
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,679
{\an8}Don't worry. She's on her phone.

115
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,307
{\an8}Unless Ralph and Princess Carolyn's
secret baby starts to trend,

116
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,476

126
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,630
unless you think of a reason
I shouldn't.

127
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,589
Nothing comes to mind.

128
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,383
Great! It's done.
Now, what did you wanna talk to me about?

129
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,469
-I'm dropping out of the race.
-What?!

130
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,554
Woodchuck's a better leader
than I'll ever be.

131

than just you and Woodchuck.

132
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:32,975
What is it about then?

133
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,603
It's about hope, and freedom,
and powerful lobbyists

134
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,730
who pay me to elect
a governor I can control

135
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,317
so we can get legislation passed
that allows them to build private prisons

136
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,236
on what are now protected wetlands.

137
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,030

can find some other puppet

I'm done running for governor,
so you're fired.

141
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,869
No hard feelings, right?

142
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,372

-Not tonight.
-Cigarette?

-I don't smoke.
-That's okay.

160

You can just stand around me
while I smoke.

161
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:31,993
No, I don't want to.

162
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:32,910
Cocaine, then?

163
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,996
I so appreciate that,
and I hate to be rude,

164
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,831
but I really don't think it's a good idea.

165
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,083
Would you like me to punch you
in the belly real quick

166
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,169
so you remember
what it's like to be alive?

167
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,628
That's a rich person thing.

168
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,547
Oh, I know.
I grew up around rich people.

169
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,675
But I'm actually good,
as far as belly-punchings go.

170
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,344
Well, can I at least offer you a ride
on our private rollercoaster?

171
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,805
Surely, there's no reason
you wouldn't want to do that.

172
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,974
-So if you decline, I will be offended.
-Oh.

173
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,434
Also, not that it's relevant,

174
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,561
but the rollercoaster
is specifically discouraged

175
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,396
for children under five
and pregnant women.

176
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,106
But since you are neither of those,

177
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,317
obviously, there's no reason
you will not want to ride

178
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,736
on our family's really fun rollercoaster.

179
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,113
-Okay, look, the truth is--
-Hey, Dad!

180
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,991
Why don't you tell Princess Carolyn
one of your great golf stories?

181
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,659
-Say, there's an idea.
-Yes!

182
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,121
So here I am with a mashie
when what I need is a niblick.

183
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,706
[all laughing]

184
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,584
Wow, golf. Fore! Am I right?

185
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,545
Yes, that's exactly right. Golf.

186
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,088
[camera shutters clicking]

187
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,259
Californians, this is an endorsement!

188
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,677
My message is simple.

189
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,598
If you want to vote Peanutbutter,
vote Coodchuck-Berkowitz

190
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,976
because a vote for Coodchuck-Berkowitz
is a vote for Peanutbutter.

191
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,894
Uh--

192
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,813
Since Peanutbutter
likes Coodchuck-Berkowitz.

193
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,776
So if you like Coodchuck-Berkowitz,
vote like Mr. Peanutbutter...

194
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,612
-Excuse me--
-...for Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.

195
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,157
So if we want to vote for Woodchuck,
we should vote for you?

196
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,075
-No.
-Yes.

197
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,452
-By voting for Woodchuck.
-Thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter.

198
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,246
I look forward to moving past

199
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,498
the political divisiveness
of this campaign

200
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,125
and <i>finally </i>focusing on the issues.

201
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,502
What's with the gorilla feet?

202
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,962
[sighs]

203
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,088
As I've explained before,

204
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,257
my hands were crushed
during the fracking incident.

205
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,509
There were no hand transplants
readily available,

206
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,011
but gorilla feet are somewhat hand-like.

207
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,097
So I am using them temporarily

208
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,642
while my doctors
find me more suitable replacements.

209
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,436
[laughs]
They sure made a monkey out of you, huh?

210
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,188
-[reporters laugh]
-They did no such thing.

211
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,273
Gorillas are apes.

212
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,566
I feel that went pretty well.

213
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,277
Yes, well, thank you
for dropping out of the race.

214
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,239
Rest assured, under my stewardship,
the state will be in good--

215
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,616
-You were gonna say "hands," weren't you?
-Ugh.

216
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,785
So, what's next for us two amigos?

217
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,830
Mr. Peanutbutter,
we don't need your help on the campaign.

218
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,000
We are running virtually unopposed.
I think our team can handle it from here.

219
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,209
Wha-wha-wha-what?

220
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,796
The best way you can help us
is to go back to your regular life

221
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,215
and stay out of politics forever.

222
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:56,053
So this chapter of my life is over?
Doggy, doggy. What now?

223
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,763
Coochy-coochy-coochy...

224
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,599
Hey, Mom.
You got something in the mail.

225
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,810
Have I received
any gentleman callers today?

226
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,980
I'm expecting a visit
from Corbin Creamerman.

227
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,231
You know what? I'll check.

228
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,067
You could learn a thing or two
from him, Henrietta!

229
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:10,985
Mm-hmm.

230
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,113
-Hey, where have you been?
-I'll make coffee.

231
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,531
Oh, uh...

232
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,242
well, Miles actually took me
to check out UCLA.

233
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,911
He took me to a party,
and I got to sleep in a dorm room, and...

234
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,414
Wow, look at the time.
That's enough questioning of me,

235
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,916
and where I've been,
and what I've been doing. See ya later!

236
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,044
Hold up.
Did you and that PA hook up last night?

237
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,504
BoJack! We didn't just hook up.

238
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,465
Miles is a really interesting soul,

239
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,925
-and I feel like we connected.
-Oh, boy. Okay. Sit down.

240
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,637
Hollyhock, you are never gonna hear
from that guy again.

241
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,971
Okay, actually, I am,

242
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,098
because when I left his dorm
he said he would,

243
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,351
and I quote, "Definitely text me."

244
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,935
Oh, wow, I didn't realize.

245
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,646
Should we plan the wedding for you

246
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,523
and teenage-boy-you-slept-with
who-said-he-would-definitely-text-you"?

247
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,608
Very funny.

248
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,860
Believe me, I take no pleasure
in telling you this,

249
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,780
-but that kid is never, ever, ever--
-[phone chimes]

250
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,616
-Ooh! BoJack--
-Hollyhock, it is very rude to interrupt.

251
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,659
Now, where was I?

252
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,537
Right. You'll never <i>ever</i>
hear from this guy again.

253
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,622
-But, I--
-Ba-ba-ba!

254
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,833
In fact, if he texts you,
I will do a hundred pushups.

255
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,462
That's how sure I am,
since there is no possible way--

256
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,798
"Had a great time last night. Kilometers."

257
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,715
"Kilometers"?

258
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,093
It's an inside joke between me and Miles.

259
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,136
Not inside enough.
I figured it out and it's dumb.

260
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,139
-[phone chimes]
-He wants to take me to a party tonight.

261
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,058
-Shouldn't you be doing pushups?
-[sighs]

262
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,644
Nope, can't. Impossible.

263
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,437
Anyone who says
they did a pushup is lying.

264
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,481
-[phone chimes]
-That him canceling? Classic move.

265
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,525
No, he wants to spend the day together.

266
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,527
Oh. Well, you wanna
have breakfast first?

267
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,529
I got a box of crullers,
of which one remains.

268
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,030
Nah, I'm good with this coffee.

269
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,907
I'll be home for dinner, though. Bye!

270
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,742
Okay.

271
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,121

272
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,833
-Ah! I could do this all day.

-[horn honking]
-[gasps, whimpers]

274
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:58,050
We have gathered in Todd's new apartment
to discuss the future of PB Livin'.

275
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,635
You told me this was an intervention

276
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,138
to get Todd to stop coming up
with awful ideas.

277
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,014
That was a pretense
to get you to show up.

278
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,808
-What?
-It was Todd's idea.

279
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,101
What else you got, Todd?

280
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:11,147
Well, I got this one thing.
I don't know. It might be pretty dumb.

281
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,441
-You bite your tongue.
-Yes, bite it all the way off!

282
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,985
All your ideas are beyond terrible.

283
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,363
Well, in that case, I guess I must have
"terrible" business instincts.

284
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,990
-You do!
-Because I wanna hear it.

285
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,285
They say "the devil's in the details,"
so let's summon the devil!

286
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,036
Okay, so you know how hard it is

287
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,664
-to get your kids to go to the dentist?
-I don't.

288
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,709
But what if dentists
had a friendlier face?

289
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,002
Ooh!

290
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,629
What if you could take your kids
to a dentist's office

291
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,090
where all the dentists were clowns?

292
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,259
-What?!
-Kids love clowns!

293
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,136
-Do kids love clowns?
-Actually--

294
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,972
Don't they?
Who else would clowns be for?

295
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,932
Because adults don't love clowns.

296
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,768
That is true.
Adults find clowns creepy and off-putting.

297
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,480
So kids <i>must </i>love clowns,

298
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,065
because otherwise,
why would there be clowns?

299
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,442
That is sound logic. Okay.

300
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,153
I want these clown dentists
laughing maniacally

301
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,823
as they drill into the teeth
of America's children, starting yesterday!

302
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,160
As someone who <i>does </i>have children,
I have to say,

303
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,663
a lot of kids
are actually <i>terrified </i>of clowns!

304
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,748
Are they? Hm.

305
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,375
That would have been helpful information
before I committed.

306
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,587
But my word is my bond
and I already said yes, didn't I?

307
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,757
Okay, so do we find dentists
and train them to be clowns,

308
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,301
or do we get clowns
and train them to be dentists?

309
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,888
Why don't we get clowns and dentists
and they can train each other?

310
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,725
Oh, somebody call the police department,
because you are <i>on fire!</i>

311
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,019

It's been so wonderful getting
to know you all these last few days.

00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:46,283
We're so happy to have you.
Now, let the festivities begin.

-Sissy, hand out those cat ears.
-Cat ears?

319
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,038
-And this is for you.
-I want those.

320
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,540
See, the feast is about remembering

321
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,000
the ancient tale of a heroic mouse
named Squeaky.

322
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,587
And we always start by wearing cat ears
and singing the song of Squeaky's enemy,

323
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,631
the cat tyrant, King Pusspuss.

324
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:05,344
Looks like Princess Carolyn
won't need any cat ears to look evil.

I really wish you'd told me
your family's holiday was so anti-cat.

I'm trying to keep you out of trouble

I texted you I was gonna be home late.

You don't tell me when

This is my house.
You need to ask permission.

-What? You're not my dads.
-I'm just looking out for you.

There's nothing to worry about!
We like each other.

[stammers, sighs]

364
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,903
He's a teenage boy

whose job is to be around hot women
in skimpy outfits all day.

366
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,658
You think he's gonna want--

367
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,575
What?

368
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,202
No, I just mean that...

369
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,245
What, you think
I'm not attractive enough for him?

370
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,374
Well, you're the one
who said you were a blob.

371
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,501
-Do you think I'm a blob?
-No.

372
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,212
What kind of person
calls his own daughter a blob?

373
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,547
-You said "blob."
-I said I "felt" like a blob.

374
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,591
Do <i>you </i>think I'm a blob?

375
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,676
I just-- [sighs]

376
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,805
I just think L.A. is a superficial town
and you need to be careful.

377
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,140
Well, Miles likes me just the way I am.

378
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,893
And that's the kind of person
that I want to spend my time with.

379
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,854
Hollyhock, wait. Wait. Wait!

380
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,565
I get it! It's my weight!

381
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,948
Yeah... I'm sorry about all that.

382
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,574
Why didn't you tell me they hate cats?

383
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,534
They don't hate cats.

384
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,495
Now I get why you didn't want
to tell your family about the baby.

385
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,789
Okay, I was a little nervous.
But they'll come around.

386
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,917
Besides, what am I supposed to do?
They're my family.

387
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,087
-And what are me and Philbert?
-[sighs] Oh...

388
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,635
Can't believe she's still pissed.

389
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,303
You shouldn't have called her a "blob."

390
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,056
I'm a blob too! We're both blobs!

391
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,184
How about just as a general rule,
don't ever call a woman a blob?

392
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,022
Never! What if I meet a woman
whose name is Barbara Lob?

393
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,399
And I call her "B" for short. "B. Lob."

394
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,068
Maybe instead of figuring out
the woman blob workaround,

395
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,987
you should just tell Hollyhock
you're sorry.

396
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,031
I still think Miles is up to something.

397
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,532
Why is it so hard for you to believe

398
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,367
someone could genuinely
like your daughter?

399
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,202
Because she's like me!

400
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:22,708
Okay. Do you think maybe this could be
more about <i>you </i>than it is about her?

401
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,878
Yes, obviously, I have a lot of work
to do on myself. Everyone knows that.

402
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,881
But the important thing right now
is how I can fix things with Hollyhock.

403
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,591
Try to stay on topic, Diane.

404
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,010
Well, an open conversation
about your concerns with--

405
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,637
No, that's too Diane-y.
She'd never buy it was coming from me.

406
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,014
Then why do you want my advice?

407
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,184
I got it. If I can somehow prove to her
what a jerk Miles is,

408
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,352
then she'll have to like me more
by default.

409
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,645
That's the BoJack way.

410
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,231
BoJack, no--!
Oh-- oh...

411
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,358
Ooh, that's... that's nice.

412
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,903
Goldie, how would you like
to advance to the final round?

413
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:55,240
I would do anything, and I mean, anything.

414
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,244
-So I did it. I had sex with the PA.
-You had sex with him?

415
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,913
That's what you wanted, right?

416
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,998
I just said "seduce" the PA.

417
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,708
Doesn't that mean have sex with him?

418
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,378
No, I just wanted you to,
like, get him all hot and bothered.

419
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,506
-Eh...?
-And <i>ready </i>to sleep with you.

420
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,216
Then once you get him on audiotape

421
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,093
-saying that he would sleep with you...
-What?

422
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,762
...come up with some excuse to get
out of there with virtue intact.

423
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,640
That's a lot of specifics
you just assumed I would know.

424
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,851
Okay, well, the important thing is,
we got him now.

425
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,020
Tell Miles what you told me.

426
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,439
-I had sex with the PA.
-What PA?

427
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,651
I think his name was "Eggberg"?

428
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,694
-What? Not him?
-That's the intern.

429
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,823
-You said "PA."
-Did you think I was a PA? Nice!

430
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,407
Why'd you want her to sleep with me?

431
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,492
Not sleep with.

432
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,788
You told a contestant
you would advance her to the final round

433
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,289
if she slept with a PA?

434
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,667
I said "seduce." There is a distinction.

435
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,294
We make a show about empowering women
and lifting them up,

436
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,297
and you cheapen it
with this coarse vulgarity.

437
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,633
I cannot lie. You disgust me.

438
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,218
This was all a big misunderstanding.

439
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,804
Cover up your bottom and go, BoJack.

440
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:03,225
You're not fit to judge
anyone's character, or their booties.

441
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,436
So it <i>is </i>about judging booties.

442
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,855
[groans]

443
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,356
-Hey, BoJack.
-Miles.

444
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,567
Don't want me dating your daughter,
you could have told me.

445
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,693
I'm sorry.

446
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,070
Maybe we could've worked out
some sort of deal.

447
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,321
What do you mean?

448
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,408
All right, so I got this screenplay,
and I think it's a really fresh area.

449
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,035
It's about a production intern
who wants to be a writer.

450
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,120
Oh, wow.

451
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,039
I think it could go somewhere
if it got in front of the right person.

452
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,584
So if you have like an agent
or a manager you could give it to,

453
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,837
that would be awesome,
and I would never talk to Hollyhock again.

454
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,921
I promise.

455
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,927
So you were right. He <i>was </i>a dirtbag.

456
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,847
Yeah. I was kinda hoping
I was wrong for once.

457
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,265
If it makes you feel any better,

458
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,475
you were wrong
about all the other parts of this.

459
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,478
Diane, you are so bad
at making people feel better.

460
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,855
Are you gonna tell Hollyhock?

461
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,566
She's a smart girl.
She'll figure it out eventually.

462
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,528
But for now, if she believes someone
can love her for who she really is,

463
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,197
then why would I take that
away from her?

464
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,492
BoJack, you gotta get
one of these massages.

465
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,119
-Oh-hh!
-Okay.

466
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,247
-[Mimi] Goodbye, darling.
-[Sissy] It was good seeing you.

467
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,500
-It was so much fun seeing you both.
-Thank you for hosting us.

468
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,252
It was so nice to get away for the week

469
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,338
and learn all about
your charming little traditions

470
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,173
that didn't freak me out at all. Bye-bye!

471
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,009
Did our little city mouse
have a nice time in the country?

472
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,093
Everything was wonderful.

473
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,639
And your little companion was darling--
for a week.

474
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,433
But I do hope the next one you bring home
knows how to appreciate

475
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,435
a good Feast of Saint Squeaky.

476
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,978
Well, for your information,

477
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,022
there's not gonna <i>be </i>a "next one,"
because...

478
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,692
I love Princess Carolyn and we're having
a baby and I couldn't be happier!

479
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,110
[Mimi] Oh, my God.

480
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,158
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter, I am so relaxed.

481
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,410
I didn't realize
how much tension I'd built up in my--

482
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,039
Oh, my God! Um...

483
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:54,002
Mr. Peanutbutter, why is our hotel room
filled with dentist clowns?

484
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,921
Don't be ridiculous, Diane.

485
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,798
They're not all dentist clowns.

486
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,675
Half of them are clown dentists.

487
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,969
Just try to ignore them
and go about your business.

488
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,929
-Okay.
-So, this is the incisor.

489
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,764
Doc, if this is what's incisor,

490
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,517
I'd hate to see what's outsides 'er.
Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk!

491
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,561
-Please try to focus, Dr. Boing-Boing.

Well, there's no way
they could beat Woodchuck, right?

514
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,324
No? Because I almost beat him

515

what a governor does.
