["Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" playing]

2
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:15,682
Halloween. Fright Night.
Spook-tober 30-cursed!

3
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,643
Oh, there's the light switch.
I'm still getting used to this new house.

4
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,771
I just bought it and it's the '60s!
No, I'm just kidding!

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,857
It's 1993, and I'm wearing a costume!

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,193
Groovy threads!
But you just got drafted, hippie!

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,946
-Hmm?
-Into the cutest husband army!

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,073
-[laughs, moans]
-Aw!

9
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,366
Where's your costume?

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,493
Can't I just wear a dumb hat
and say I'm Blossom?

11
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,495
In my opinionation... Yes.

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,707
I am so excited to go
to a real Hollywood party

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,084
with my husband the TV star.

14
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,462
Just do me a favor
and don't leave me alone, okay?

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,298
-Okay!
-Now hurry up and finish getting ready.

16
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,591
I'm kidding.

17
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,384
Can you imagine
if I spoke to you like that?

18
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,844
I really can't!

19
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,263
Next time, we're doing
a couples costume, though!

20
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:59,392
It's the perfect way to tell the world
that you are completely on the same...

21
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,519
-<i>paaaaage?</i>
-What are you wearing?

22
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,189
I thought we were going
as Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling

23
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,483
in the this-year 2004 hit film
<i>The Notebook.</i>

24
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>Ooοοοh!</i> You just said, <i>"The Notebook."</i>

25
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,279
I thought you were gonna be, like,
a pen or something.

26
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,740
The important thing is
we both look super-cute,

27
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,241
and everyone is gonna be, like,

28
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,411
"Hey, is that Jessica Biel
from the upcoming<i> Blade: Trinity?''</i>

29
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,749
And I'll say my famous<i> Blade: Trinity</i>
catchphrase, "Stop goofin' around, Blade!"

30
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,959
Are you sure you're gonna be okay
at this party?

31
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,545
Whenever I went with Katrina,
we'd always end up in a big fight.

32
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,798
Well, I'm not Katrina.
This is gonna be fun.

33
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,008
Okay. I just know you're afraid
of mummies.

34
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,636
And since it's Halloween,
we might see some mummies.

35
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,970
I'm not afraid of mummies.

36
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,724
I just don't like them
because of an incident...

37
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,101
from my past.

38
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,978
Will you stay on the lookout
and keep those creepy corpses away?

39
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,690
I'll be sure to make
a mental<i> note</i> of it!

40
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,817
I'm a notebook.

41
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,735
I'm not sure I get our costumes.

42
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,153
You're the guy from<i> The Hangover.</i>

43
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,240
The first one, which just came out
this year. Why did I say "first one?"

44
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,618
There's only one<i> Hangover</i> movie,
and it's 2009.

45
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,997
-And you are...?
-Your Baby Bjorn Borg.

46
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,290
Famous '70s tennis player!

47
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,210
-And what's with the robot stuff?
-Borg. From<i> Star Trek?</i>

48
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,461
And you're also a baby?

49
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:12,298
In<i> The Hangover,</i> the guy had a Baby Bjorn.
Baby Bjorn Borg.

50
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,009
-Seems like a lot of explaining.
-People will get it.

51
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,887
Anyway, we are going to have fun
at this party!

52
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,306
You said BoJack Horseman
is gonna be there?

53
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,267
Oh, my God. I'm so nervous.

54
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,311
I'm not! Every Halloween party I went to
with one of my ex-wives,

55
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,021
we'd get in a huge blow out.

56
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,400
I am so relieved that you are fun
and easygoing,

57
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,194
-so there's no danger of that happening!
-Mm-hmm...

58
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,905
I love that we both love parties.
But more than that...

59
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,741
-I love you.
-Aw, I love you, too.

60
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,660
And I love these costumes!

61
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,912
But tell me one more time,
what are these costumes?

62
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,082
We're new social media app
sensation Tweed Feed!

63
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,667
It's Insta plus Snapchat...

64
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,754
if they both boinked Friendster,
which I guess was a thing in the '70s?

65
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:57,427
[chuckles] Believe you me.
This party is going to be dope. Booyah!

66
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,804
It'll be off the heezy fo' sheezy.

67
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,223
OMG, it's gonna be cray-cray!

68
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,561
Turnt! This is going to be
the best Halloween ever!

69
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,229
[theme music playing]

70
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:08,373
{\an8}Wow. My first fancy Hollywoo party.
"I'm ready for my close up!"

71
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,332
{\an8}Nice!

72
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,584
{\an8}<i>-Sunset Boulevard?</i>
-I usually take <i>Fountain.</i>

73
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,047
BoJack must really love Halloween
if he has this big bash every year, huh?

74
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,675
Oh, yeah, he's a real fiend for the 'ween.

75
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,468
{\an8}[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

76
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,096
{\an8}-Who are you and what are you doing here?
-[chuckling] Good one!

77
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,431
{\an8}Pretending not to know your old friend
Mr. Peanutbutter.

78
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,641
{\an8}Why are you at my house?

79
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,602
{\an8}Remember when I invited you
to my Halloween party, and you said,

80
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,937
{\an8}you'd love to come, but couldn't

81
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,981
{\an8}because you were having
your own Halloween party?

82
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:33,898
{\an8}Oh, right.

83
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,735
{\an8}Well, I'm sure my guests will show up
any minute, so, you should probably go.

84
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,364
{\an8}Well, I figured,
"Hey, why not have a crossover party?"

85
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:45,285
{\an8}So, I brought my party, wait for it,
to you!

86
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,830
{\an8}That was the first ever <i>"Wait for it!"</i>
It's 1993!

87
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,498
{\an8}-Uh...
-Come on in, guys!

-[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

90
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,087
{\an8}God damn it, why are you here?

91
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,133
{\an8}At the end of last year's Halloween party,
you said, "Let's do this again next year,"

92
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,344
{\an8}like you've said at every Halloween party
for the last 11 years!

93

[cheering, whooping]

94
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,306
That does not sound like me.

95
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,519
Oh, no. Mr. Peanutbutter?
Partygoers? No. Is it--

96
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,478
Sure is!

97
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,732
Happy "Your 25-Years-Running"
Halloween Party!

98
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,483
-[cheering]
-Hallo-ween! Hallo-ween!

99
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,903
-Hallo-ween! Hallo-ween!
-No. Don't. Please. Don't. No. You see--

100
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,531
So, we're having a party?
Why didn't you say this was happening?

101
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,534
Because I hate that it happens.
I take no action to make it happen.

102
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,829
{\an8}Every year, I pray that it won't happen,
and it keeps happening anyway!

103
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,623
{\an8}I feel like an idiot being
at a Halloween party without a costume.

104
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,418
{\an8}-Who cares? I don't have a costume.
-Uh, you're wearing a costume.

105
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,754
Do you mean, in the sense
that we all wear costumes,

106
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,757
such as we reveal facets of ourselves
to those closest to us,

107
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,383
but our truest selves remain hidden?

108
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,178
No, in the sense
that you are literally wearing a costume

109
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,055
-from the TV show we both work on.
-Oh, yeah!

110
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,890
I'll go to Rite Aid to see
what I can arrange.

111
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,641
Don't let the party end
before I get back.

112
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,560
I definitely will let it die down!

113
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,522
Oh, shit, the Halloween party.

114
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,775
-[guests chattering]
-[music playing]

115
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,694
Oh. Hey, careful with the-- I'm sorry.
Can you put a coaster--

116
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,112
-[doorbell rings]
-Can someone--?

117
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,655
-You! Marv's intern!
-[grunts]

118
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,157
-You're on door duty.
-You got it!

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,284
-[glass shatters]
-I'm very good at opening doors.

120
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,078
Do you have any candy
for trick-or-treaters?

121
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,205
{\an8}No. I don't know.
Just hand out these Emmy screeners.

122
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,247
I'm on it.

123
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,167
Those kids'll be holding out their hands
for Franz.

124
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,836
Why grip a Twix when you can Sip-o-wicz?

125
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,090
{\an8}What? I don't-- Just keep answering
the door until I tell you to stop.

126
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,133
-You got it, chief!
-[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

127
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,430
-Diane! What are you supposed to be?
-An annoyed writer who hates Halloween.

128
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,224
Well, you are nailing it.

129
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,685
I'm just here to drop off pages
for BoJack. How's the party?

130
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,188
I wouldn't know.
I'm stuck on door duty, like always.

131
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,815
[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

132
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,941
{\an8}Trick or treat!

133
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,318
No. You are way too old
to be trick-or-treating,

134
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,404
and way too young to be a guest
at this party.

135
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:49,242
Oh, no! Why did I give you the option
of trick or treat? I just wanted treat!

136
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,120
Come back when you're five years older,
or three years younger.

137
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,621
[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

138
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:54,831
How 'bout now?

139
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,290
Okay. Come on in.

140
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,710
-Whoa! Cool house.
-Oh, thank you.

141
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,046
-It's not mine. It's my boyfriend's.
-Really?

142
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,008
-Why does he make you answer the door?
-No, he doesn't make me, he's--

143
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:10,179
Oh, my God. You're right! What am I doing?
What am I doing with my life?

144
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,766
Uh, well, judging by your outfit,
I'd say you're a pilot of some sort?

145
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,644
I moved to L.A. when I was 18
and now I'm 35!

146
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,897
-Everything's happening so fast!
-Oh, no! I'm 18!

147
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,401
Am I going to be 35 soon?
That's when they make you president!

148
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,362
I don't want that!
That's too much responsibility!

149
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,240
I can't do this anymore.
You! Take my shift!

150
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,160
Oh, no!
The responsibilities are already starting!

151
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,369
I gotta live my life!

152
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,914
I deserve to be adored by a man,
yet here my dreams lie dormant!

153
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,624
I don't mean to get mordantly morbid,

154
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,336
but did I get all adorably adorned
to get bored manning doors? No more!

155
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,424
Okay, this cider has not been
sufficiently alcoholed.

156
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,719
If I'm trapped here with all you losers,
I'm at least getting drunk.

157
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,220
[sips]

158
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,681
Whoa! God! I think
somebody spiked the cider!

159
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,225
[chuckles] Well, I guess
one drink won't hurt.

160
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,768
No, I get that it's the<i> X-Files.</i>

161
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,063
I'm just saying, what happened to the "A"
through "W" Files?

162
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,232
I wanna see that show. More files!

163
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,775
-Hey.
-Oh, hey, there you are!

164
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,653
Sweetheart, you disappeared
while I was in the bathroom.

165
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,324
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just
got distracted by the fun party.

166
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,702
But I will not leave your side agai--
Oh, my God, is that Erica?

167
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,287
No, no, please don't go talk to Erica.

168
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,707
Katrina. Erica doesn't know anybody else
at this party.

169
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,501
It would be rude to leave her
all by herself.

170
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,085
Well, can I at least come with you?

171
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,254
You know Erica can't talk
to two people at once

172
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,131
on account of her split-brain procedure!

173
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,760
Why don't you go talk to, uh...
the teacher from<i> Ferris Bueller's Day Off?</i>

174
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,677
Ben Stein?

175
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,890
I'll bet that famously boring man
is a blast at parties. I'll be right back.

176
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,309
-No, don't--
-Erica! Love the costume!

177
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,687
Where did you find such a hideous--?
Oh, my mistake, I'm so sorry.

178
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,813
Ugh!

179
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,527
Are you sure this is a good idea,
13-year-old Todd?

180
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,112
It's part of the Halloween Code.

181
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,491
If you don't give teenagers candy,
they're going to TP your house.

182
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,534
Okay.

183
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,576
[grunts]

184
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,619
[grunts]

185
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:57,828
[grunts]

186
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,751
Okay, I've scoped out the party,
and I've yet to see a single mummy.

187
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,003
As Margaret Thatcher's children
often asked,

188
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,880
[imitating child]
"Is Mummy coming to see us?"

189
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,757
[normal]
And as their nanny always replied,

190
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,050
[British accent] "Not tonight."

191
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,802
-Thank god.
-[normal voice] I have to ask,

192
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,345
what is the deal with the mummies?

193
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,306
Okay. I auditioned for<i> The Mummy</i> movie.

194
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,100
-The one with Brendan Fraser?
-Ooh!

195
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,768
And I thought everything was going well,

196
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,312
and then something
really traumatic happened.

197
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:27,525
-Oh, my God, what?
-I, uh... I didn't get the part.

198
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,028
That's it? You just didn't get it?

199
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,698
I really wanted it!
And it still haunts me!

200
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,576
It's my one major career disappointment
as of 2004,

201
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,244
so could you please do me
this one thing

202
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,996
and make sure I don't see any mummies?

203
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,998
I promise. No mummies.

204
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,459
Remember that time that lady
freaked out 'cause she saw a mummy?

205
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,877
[BoJack and Pickles laughing]

206
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,047
-Who was that lady?
-Uh, that was actually Jessica Biel.

207
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,173
Who? [chuckles]

208
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,175
-One of my ex-wives?
-Oh, yeah!

209
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,761
You've brought so many wives
and girlfriends to these parties,

210
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,307
-I cannot keep track.
-Well, don't forget about Pickles, huh?

211
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,602
Uh, what? Why is the waitress here
talking about pickles?

212
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,644
Somebody order pickles?

213
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,230
No, BoJack, this is my girlfriend.
Her name is Pickles.

214
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,065
You can remember
because if you look at me,

215
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,984
and don't recall my name, you'll think,

216
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,111
"Who is this person?
I'm in a real pickle!"

217
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,697
And then just know that my name
is like the thing that you're in,

218
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,532
but with an "S" at the end.

219
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,451
-What?
-I'm Pickles!

220
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,329
-My last name is Aplenty!
-Do I need to know this one?

221
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,956
-Is she gonna be around for a while?
-[chuckles]

222
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,625
I like that you're razzing me.

223
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,668
It really makes me feel
like one of the gang.

224
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,129
If he teases you, that means he likes you.

225
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,131
What? Is that what people think
when I tease them?

226
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,800
[gasps]

227
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,552
[sighs] Cool.

228
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,889
Remember the year
that Pinky won the costume contest,

229
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,725
but then it turned out he'd just lost
all his belongings in a fire,

230
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,894
and those clothes were all that he owned?

231
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,812
-[laughing]
-[gulps] That was classic!

232
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,190
Oh, shit, I gotta go run
the costume contest.

233
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,609
Ow! My back! Why'd I do that?

234
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,487
It sounds like
you all have a lot of history.

235
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,615
Yeah. I can't believe
we've been doing this party since '93.

236
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:02,578
-That's the year I was born!
-I... did not realize that!

237
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,288
[chuckles] Hey, cheers!

238
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,665
-[gulps]
-[Diane sighs]

239
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,375
Are you having fun?

240
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,504
Yeah, I'm having a great time explaining
my costume to people over and over again.

241
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,757
Hey, here's a thought:
if you don't get someone's costume,

242
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,468
you don't need to tell them!
Just live your life!

243
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,388
-Do you wanna leave?
-No, no, no, no! I'm fun!

244
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,598
I don't want to leave! [chuckles]

245
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,100
I wanna leave!

246
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,728
Who has the yellow military
assault vehicle blocking me in?

247
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,731
-Oh, that's me!
-Since when do you drive a Hummer?

248
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,526
Company car.
I just like it 'cause it matches my hat.

249
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,905
Plus, lots of room for the golf clubs,
and, boy, does that kitten purr.

250
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,783
Why don't you take her out for a spin
and see how she handles?

251
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,493
What is his costume?

252
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,872
-Diane! Hi!
-Hey...

253
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,084
Am I on the hit Priscilla Barnes vehicle
<i>Three's Company</i> right now,

254
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,502
because three's company.

255
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,921
-I'm just trying to get out of here.
-Oh, my gosh, Diane,

256
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,675
I just want you to know that I know
that you and Mister have a history...

257
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,260
-"Mister?"
-And I'm fine with it,

258
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:03,305
and there's no reason we should be awkward
around each other, or jealous, you know?

259
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,182
-I'm not jealous of you.
-Okay, good.

260
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,603
I'm not jealous of you either,
even though you are really intimidating.

261
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,023
But if we were jealous of each other,
that would be very normal,

262
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,777
so either way, it's totally cool.
Totally cool. [hiccups]

263
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,821
Should we do shots together

264
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,115
to, like, celebrate
how normal we're being?

265
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,951
Yeah, this is a good situation.

266
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,619
Okay, bye, Diane!

267
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,790
-Did I screw up? I'm so stupid.
-No. That's just Diane.

268
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,042
She doesn't like parties
and she hates fun.

269
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,171
-Oh!
-No, that's not fair. She used to be fun.

270
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,090
In fact, when we first started dating,
my favorite thing about her was

271
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,468
that she was so much more fun
than my other ex-wives.

272
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,137
Oh, we're talking about your exes again!
That's great.

273
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,514
Of course, Jessica used to be fun, too.

274
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,850
That's why I started seeing her
after Katrina

275
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:52,146
because Katrina was so mean and cynical,
and Jessica was sweet and full of life.

276
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,231
Yeah, she sounds awesome.

277
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,400
But, actually, now that I think about it,

278
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,195
when I first met Katrina,
she was also full of life.

279
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,864
Do you want another drink?
I'm going to get another drink.

280
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,533
Oh, my God. What a weird coincidence.

281
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,870
Why do all these idealistic,
vivacious women eventually turn bitter

282
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,457
and cruel after being with me?
What's the common denominator?

283
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,460
-[guests chattering]
-[laughter]

284
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,879
Ugh. [sighs]

285
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,964
-Hey, buddy.
-Ugh.

286
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,718
The conga line leader
accidentally led us right into the pool.

287
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,094
I've never felt so alive!

288
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,138
-You should've been there!
-I want to go home now.

289
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,600
-What? But this party is so fun!
-It's not fun for me.

290
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,435
'Cause I don't know anyone here.

291
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,147
Of course you do. Just-- BoJack!
You remember my wife Katrina.

292
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,316
-Huh? No, I do not.
-This is going great.

293
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,986
-I'm gonna go dry off. You two chat it up.
-No, Mr. Peanutbutter, please.

294
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,154
[exhales]

295
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,532
Thank you for hosting this party.

296
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,408
So fun.

297
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,287
-What's the story on the hat?
-It's a Blossom costume.

298
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:54,250
Oh, shit, that's right! It's Halloween.
I need a costume! Good call, stranger!

299
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,209
Ugh.

300
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:01,590
So, I love parties, as you know,
but maybe we should go soon?

301
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,761
There are so many famous people here,
it's actually making me kind of anxious.

302
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,223
Diane! Famous people are just
like you and me.

303
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,225
Well, like me, because I am one.

304
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,395
Mom? No, I can't talk right now.
Can I call you tomorrow?

305
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,772
Or is this the one night a year
you emerge from your crypt?

306
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,358
Go introduce yourself.
I'm sure he'd love to meet you!

307
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,152
-Or we could just go home?
-No, come on.

308
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,655
It's Halloween,
a night to face your fears.

309
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,323
That's why they call it Halloween!

310
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,201
So, you can wean yourself off
of having fears!

311
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,745
Say<i> "Hallo"</i> to weaning!

312
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,746
[Diane whimpers]

313
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,126
Okay. Todd's Hummer is now blocked in
by a blue Tesla.

314
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,212
I'm looking for the owner of a blue Tesla.

315
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,715
Studies say buying used is actually better
for the environment,

316
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,135
but, hey, you tried,
and subsequently trapped me at this party!

317
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,052
[both] Oh.

318
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,345
-Hi.
-Hi.

319
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,391
-So, thanks for the new script pages.
-You got it.

320
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,019
Hey, listen. That submarine scene...

321
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,688
You wanna talk about it?

322
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,065
-No?
-Okay.

323
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,152
We'll just put that in the large bucket
of things we don't talk about.

324
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,863
-What is that supposed to mean?
-That you didn't wanna talk about it.

325
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,281
[groans, grunts]

326
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,328
[gulps] This party sucks.

327
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,164
Hey, doorman! I don't have a costume.

328
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,791
And I don't wanna look stupid
at my own bitchin' Halloween party.

329
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,919
Okay, I've got an idea.

330
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,882
There. You're a one-night stand.
Get it? Nightstand?

331
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,134
Nice! You should be a producer
or something.

332
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,719
-Ha, ha. Yeah, right!
-[doorbell neighs]

333
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,847
-But not yet. Keep manning the door.
-[sighs] Yeah.

334
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,476
Ah! All dry! Sorry,
I got a little distracted on the way back

335
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,977
by some people with a Ouija board.

336
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,856
A dead soul told me to "AERXIXFASP"!

337
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,108
-What could it mean?
-Cool.

338
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,736
While you were gone,
Ben Stein introduced me to Tim Allen,

339
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,572
and the three of us had a long debate
about government spending,

340
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,991
which is exactly
how I wanted to spend my Halloween.

341
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,577
-I am so sorry.
-Although, I have to say,

342
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,622
now that your TV show has put us
into a new tax bracket,

343
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,874
maybe we should start
paying attention more

344
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,542
to how the government is using our money.

345
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,002
-What?
-No, I don't know, ya know,

346
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,546
I'm just saying
that a true capitalist-free market

347
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,298
is actually, if you really think about it,

348
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,052
more fair than an arbitrary redistribution
based on need.

349
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,973
-This is from <i>Ten Minutes with Tim Allen?</i>
-You left me alone for an hour and a half!

350
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,849
I guess time flies
when you're having fun?

351
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,436
-I am not having fun!
-[all gasping]

352
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,063
[grunts]

353
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,403
Hey, I need a costume.
I can't be costume-less at my own party.

354
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,320
Mm.

355
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,530
Hmm.

356
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,448
-Follow me.
-[gasps]

357
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,118
-Hold that. Now circle around here.
-Oh. What--

358
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,078
-Okay. Just need some tape.
-No. What are-- Hey.

359
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,247
No, I get that there's a smoke monster,

360
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,708
but other than that,
it's just<i> Gilligan's Island,</i> right?

361
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,501
-[groaning]
-[Peanutbutter gasps]

362
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,961
Oh, thank you so much.

363
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,130
No!

364
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,132
-[woman gasps]
-[panting] Whoa!

365
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,217
-[glass shatters]
-[grunts]

366
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,635
[groans] Jessica!

367
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,679
Am I written by Albert Hammond
and Diane Warren,

368
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,807
originally recorded by Tina Turner,
but popularized by Ace of Base?

369
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,892
Because "Don't Turn Around."

370
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,477
[slo-mo] Huh?

371
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,770
[groaning]

372
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,981
[screaming]

373
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,941
Mummy!

374
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,068
[gong sound]

375
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,612
What do you mean, a duel?

376
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,032
-You mean like, like a duel, a duel?
-[clears throat]

377
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,116
Hold on, somebody's--

378
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,119
-Baby Bjorn Borg.
-Oh, my God. Yes!

379
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,203
Cute. What do you want?

380
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,457
Oh, um, I actually wanted
to introduce yourself.

381
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,000
I mean myself. [chuckles]

382
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,420
Obviously, you already know yourself,
so... [laughing]

383
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:31,759
Oh, God. Listen, I just wanted to tell you
how much I loved<i> Horsin' Around.</i>

384
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:36,722
It was, like, a very formative part
of my childhood. So... thank you.

385
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,768
I get a warm feeling every time
I think about the song.

386
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,729
<i>♪ Three little orphans,</i>
<i>one, two, three... ♪</i>

387
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,731
-I'm sorry. I'm on the phone right now.
-Oh.

388
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,566
Uh... Sorry.

389
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,986
Yeah, Mom, I'm still here.
No, it was nobody important.

390
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,197
No, I get them to Glee Club.

391
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,949
But why are they singing
when they're not in the Glee Club?

392
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,494
Where's the music coming from?
Doesn't seem realistic.

393
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:02,164
Why did you make me talk to BoJack?
I made a complete fool of myself.

394
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,582
-No.
-I can't do this.

395
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm good in small groups.

396
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,211
I'm great in chat-rooms
and message boards.

397
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,630
-[shouts] But I hate big parties!
-[record scratches]

398
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,881
-What? No!
-Yes!

399
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,884
And I didn't wanna tell you because
I know how much this party means to you.

400
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,345
[shouts] But I can't be more fun
than your ex-wives!

401
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,846
It's too much pressure!

402
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,348
I'm sorry.

403
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,974
-[panting]
-[door slams]

404
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,434
Uh-huh.

405
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,979
-[music playing over stereo]
-Whoo! Uh-huh.

406
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,607
-Hey, Pickles? I'm sorry.
-For what?

407
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,609
I shouldn't talk
about my ex-wives so much.

408
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,362
I don't want you to feel
like you have to be fun.

409
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,780
But I am fun.

410
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,116
It has nothing to do with you,
or your ex-wives,

411
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,619
or your ex-wife Diane,
who is in this room right now.

412
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:44,081
Okay, now I'm looking for the owner
of a blue Tesla,

413
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,167
a red Maserati, and a gold helicopter.

414
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,754
-Let's just get out of here.
-[crying] I don't wanna get out of here!

415
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,841
-I'm having fun! This is fun for me!
-[record scratches]

416
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,968
[sobbing]

417
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,929
What's up with the waitress?

418
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,057
You left me alone all night long!

419
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,310
I ask so little of you!
And you never listen.

420
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,229
I know, but now I am listening,

421
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,065
and I swear I will stay by your side,
now and forever.

422
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,819
I'll be on you like Urkel on Laura.
"Will I do that?"

423
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,821
-Yes, I will.
-You know what? No.

424
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,198
Because now I<i> want</i> to be alone.

425
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:22,578
So, have fun hanging out with
all your hippie liberal friends, okay?

426
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,830
-'Cause I'm going home.
-Kar-nina! Don't go!

427
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,956
Ugh.

428
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,000
-Party's over.
-All right, fine.

429
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,294
Let's make this an annual thing,
though, okay?

430
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,672
I wanna see all of you, back here,
next year! No matter what!

431
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,717
I asked you to do one thing,

432
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,136
keep me away from mummies.
And you couldn't even do that!

433
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,345
Okay, in my defense,

434
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,140
I am dressed like a giant notebook,
which severely limits my mobility!

435
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,518
How do you think I felt when I had to do
that screen test all wrapped up in gauze?

436
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,812
Wait. You were auditioning
to play the mummy?

437
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,649
Mom, I gotta go. Okay?
I'll call you tomorrow.

438
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:57,571
Yeah. We will figure out Dad's funeral.
And... I'm... I'm sorry.

439
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,488
[phone beeps]

440
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,785
-You! Boy! What's going on?
-I think the party's over, sir.

441
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,703
[sighs]

442
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,457
I always thought that when this happened,
I would feel something.

443
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,542
I don't know what, but something.

444
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,712
But I don't feel anything.
What's wrong with me?

445
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,715
Nothing's wrong.
Just sometimes parties are over.

446
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,133
[sighs]

447
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,094
But... Hey, it doesn't have to be over.

448
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,597
I mean, I could stick around
for a little bit.

449
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:27,434
Yeah, sure, good idea.
Stick around for as long as you want.

450
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,560
Yeah?

451
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,897
Okay.

452
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,112
I'm sorry I ruined
another Halloween for you.

453
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,199
-You didn't ruin it.
-I really wanted you to think I was fun.

454
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,535
Diane, you don't need to pretend
to be something you're not.

455
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,371
-I already love you.
-What?

456
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,666
And I'm going to love you,
no matter what version of you you are.

457
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,960
So, you might as well give me
the real version.

458
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,629
This is good.

459
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,422
Now I know you don't like parties.

460
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,758
So, we will never have
that argument again.

461
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,802
Yeah.

462
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,639
I really humiliated myself
in front of BoJack.

463
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,224
-[engine]
-If it makes you feel better,

464
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,435
I guarantee BoJack won't even remember
that he met you.

465
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:11,937
Huh.

466
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,734
Okay, new strategy.

467
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,570
I'm looking for four
strong construction workers

468
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,906
who can lift my car
and carry it out to the street,

469
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,242
like in the Mentos commercial.
Any takers?

470
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,535
[Peanutbutter] Open the door!

471
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,203
[Pickles] Just leave me alone!

472
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,664
What's going on in there?
Tough SAT prep course?

473
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,957
Fail her learner's permit test?

474
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,042
Skirmish with the members
of the <i>Baby-Sitter's Club?</i>

475
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,836
-Nope.
-Shattered dreams of playing Adelaide

476
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,796
in her high school's production
of<i> Guys and Dolls</i>

477
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,382
because the musical director sees her
as more of a Rusty Charlie?

478
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,009
I don't know why this keeps happening.

479
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,761
I take these amazing women,
like Pickles, like you,

480
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,389
Katrina, Jessica, and I ruin them.

481
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,598
Uh...

482
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,975
I'm not <i>ruined.</i>

483
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,687
-No, I just mean... I don't listen.
-Okay, yes.

484
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,315
It is definitely very annoying
how you don't listen.

485
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,526
Thank you, but you don't have to say
nice things just to make me feel better.

486
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,320
Huh? Okay, no.

487
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:06,158
I was going to say you not listening
and I repeat, you don't listen,

488
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,661
-that's not the only thing going on here.
-There are more things?

489
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,289
-What do all these women have in common?
-They're mean?

490
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,625
-When you first start dating them.
-They're fun?

491
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,712
They're young.
You keep dating women in their 20s.

492
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,547
I do, do that.

493
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,717
They're not fully-formed yet.
Life changes people.

494
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,136
-Well, not me.
-That's kind of my point.

495
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,597
You don't ruin these women,
they just grow up.

496
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,393
So, what you're saying is...
they all grow up, but I stay the same age?

497
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:37,647
All right. All right. All right.
How do I fix that?

498
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,983
Well, either you date someone older...

499
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,487
<i>-Ooooooor...</i>
-Or, you grow up.

500
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,198
Because otherwise,
they're gonna keep outgrowing you.

501
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:47,991
Mind if I try?

502
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:58,585
Okay, first thing we need to do
is sit you up and get you hydrated.

503
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,753
Thanks.

504
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,922
I understand what you're going through.

505
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,509
I've been in your position before,
and this party is hard.

506
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,010
[hiccups] It is!

507
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,970
It's hard to be the new girlfriend.

508
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,974
And to be at a famous person's house,
at an event with 25 years of history,

509
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,936
and all these people
Mr. Peanutbutter has known for years.

510
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,648
-[hiccups] Plus, you're here.
-Plus, I'm here.

511
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,068
-What if I'm just a rebound?
-Mm.

512
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:27,489
I was a rebound.
And he loved me, so much, for ten years.

513
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,157
If there's one thing I know
about him,

514
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:33,412
it's that he loves the person he's with
deeply and unconditionally.

515
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,290
So, you don't have to worry about me,
because I'm not that person anymore.

516
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,292
-You are.
-Aw. [chuckles]

517
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,920
-[door opens]
-Oh!

518
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,048
-[Pickles sighs]
-If you guys will excuse me,

519
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,551
I'm just gonna take
this dickhole's helicopter home.

520
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,261
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

521
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,472
I'm actually really glad you went through
all those ex-wives

522
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,183
because it means
I got the best version of you.

523
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,271
-That's right. Version 4.0.
-Oh! I like the sound of that.

524
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,065
Hey, you wanna just go home?
Hang out, just the two of us?

525
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,569
Psh! No way! I just saw on Tweed Feed
that Josephine's ex, Tor,

526
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,863
is throwing a monster shindig up in NoHo.

527
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,239
Who-sephine's ex-what now?

528
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,992
They have a two-story ice luge,
and a huge beer pond tournament.

529
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,118
And I brought new costumes,

530
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,829
so we don't have to look stupid wearing
the same in all our pictures.

531
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:16,997
[laughs]

532
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,540
I never wanna grow up!

533
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,708
[chuckles]

534
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,295
[sighs] Where's everybody going?
It's Halloween!

535
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,464
[groaning]

536
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,594
[door opens] Happy Hallowee-- What the?

537
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,639
-Where is everyone?
-Hey, let's do this again next year.

538
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,475
I'm going to bed.

539
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,269
I love Halloween.
