00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,771
What is this,
breakfast?

173
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,439
Yeah, that's about right.

174
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,858
[gulping]

175
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,656
Well, that worked
effectively.

176
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,825
[newsman] <i>It's a Holly-who-done-it</i>

184
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,219
Weird.

185
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,470
Weirder.

186
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,013
[doorbell rings]

187
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,932
Why the hell would I steal
a giant D?

188
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,892
<i>Ding-dong! It's Diane.</i>

189
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,519

194
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,490
Hey, D-voted memoirist.

195
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,160
I can't work on the book today.
Too ill. Cough.

196
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,120
Are you ill,
or hung-over?

197
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,622
Because instead of coughing
you just said the word cough.

198
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,249
Plus you left me a long,
drunken voicemail last night.

199
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,541
Ooh, was it bad?

200
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,835
It was mostly a lot
of wheezing,

201
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,378
as if you were
climbing something,

202
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,005
followed by the sounds
of dismantling metal,

203
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,506
and then grunting like you were
dragging something heavy

204
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,008
at least a few miles.

205
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,010
I didn't say anything
incriminating, did I?

206
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,928
As incriminating
as that question? No.

207
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,472
Good. Well, just as
a general rule,

208
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,681
you probably shouldn't
be listening

209
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,391
to any voicemails
I leave after--

210
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,059
- What time do I start drinking?
- Noon?

211
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,187
- Yup. See you later.
- But we had an appointment.

212
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,314
What's that? An actor flaking
on an obligation?

213
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,399
- Welcome to Hollywood.
- I think you mean Hollywoo.

214
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,526
Did you see? Someone stole the D
off the sign.

215
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,861
Cough, cough, cough,
cough, cough.

216
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,280
Cough, cough, cough,
cough, door slam.

217
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,240
- [phone rings]
- What is it, BoJack?

218
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,617
You know, I'm tied up
with all my Deans today.

219
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,577
Kane, Norris, Winters,
and Koontz,

220
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,413
all being questioned
by police.

221
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,040
It was me. I stole the D.

222
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,708
- What?
<i>- Now be a good agent</i>

223
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,959
and make this
not my problem.

224
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,752
How did you even--?

225
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,005
You know, your scandal-to-work
ratio is, like, five to one.

226
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,007
Look, I need to get rid
of this before Diane sees it.

227
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,468
Why do you
care if Dia-- Oh, fish.

228
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,720
Are you in love
with your biographer?

229
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,847
What?

230
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,350
<i>[laughs]</i>
<i>What?</i>

231
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,394
Get out of here.

232
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,563
You stole the D for Diane.
Unbelievable.

233
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,190
Yeah, I don't know.
The D might be for David,

234
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,858
because apparently
when I was drunk,

235
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,361
I printed out a bunch
of pictures of David Boreanaz.

236
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,988
Yeah. You did that.

237
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,781
Look, I'll keep your little
crush busy long enough

238
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,283
for you to get rid
of the contraband,

239
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,576
but the next three weddings
I'm invited to,

240
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,245
you're my date, dummy.

241
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,872
Since when to women your age
get invited to weddings?

242
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,165
I have a lot
of nieces and nephews!

243
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,458
[phone beeps off]

244
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:44,876
- [claps]
- Well, you pulled it off,

245
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,461
you deviant.

246
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,172
Get it? D-viant?

247
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,715
- I got it.
- Tell me,

248
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,633
how are you gonna complete
your giant bracelet?

249
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,302
With the chain-link fence
from Dodger's Stadium?

250
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,138
No. How'd you figure out
it was me?

251
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,849
Oh, how did I figure it out?
Well, I just followed the clues,

252
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,810
used deduction, puzzle-solving,
a little bit of forensics,

253
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,563
and also,
what did I do?

254
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,856
Oh, I listened to the voicemail
you left me

255
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,401
saying you were stealing the D
because of Diane

256
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,862
so I could, and I quote,
"Suck your D."

257
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,822
Stop leaving voicemails!

258
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,075
Admit it!
You like my girlfriend.

259
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,120
Oh, come on. I mean,
am I attracted to her? Sure.

260
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,330
Do my days feel better
when I'm around her? Yeah.

261
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,166
Does she get me in ways
no woman ever has? Indubitably.

262
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,794
Do I fantasize about her?
Yes, but only in two positions.

263
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,712
Look, am I the kind of guy
who would try to steal

264
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,005
someone else's girlfriend?

265
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,591
Sure, of course,
but do I like her?

266
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,009
The answer's no.
You have nothing to worry about.

267
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,595
I'll cut you a deal.

268
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,430
I help you get rid
of that D,

269
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,433
and you never talk
to Diane again.

270
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,269
Well, I have to talk to her,
because she's writing my book.

271
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,355
Okay, but just don't
pursue her romantically?

272
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,149
- Deal.
- Ha!

273
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,235
- I knew I'd get that handshake.
- I regret this already.

274
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:59,200
Spread them wide, ladies.
This is a random cavity search.

275
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,828
[both] Whoa!
Buy a guy a drink first.

276
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,788
- [laughs]
- Did we just say that...

277
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,748
- Oh!
- ...at the same time?

278
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,502
Look, I saw you talking
to Klaus in the shower.

279
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,630
Now, the Aryans are good guys,
don't get me wrong.

280
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,922
But I don't know
if you're gonna get

281
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,799
the right attention
over there.

282
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,135
Uh, I'd hate to get lost
in a shop that big.

283
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,053
Now we can't
offer you the works,

284
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,264
but in the Latin Kings,
you'll be a star.

285
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,851
We're number two,
and that means we try harder.

286
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,354
Am I really being courted
by two gangs?

287
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,231
Oh, I feel like
the belle of the ball.

288
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,444
So, this is the shapeless
biographer

289
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,196
I've heard so much about.

290
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,697
We've met several times.

291
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,534
Did you just call me here
to insult me?

292
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,160
What is your secret, lady?

293
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,621
I mean, how do you get
two grown men fighting over you

294
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,623
like a foul ball
at a football game?

295
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,375
First of all, football doesn't
have foul balls.

296
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,876
Ugh, sports.

297
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,546
Second of all,
nobody's fighting over me.

298
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:53,880
Open your eyes.

299
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,756
BoJack's clearly
in love with you.

300
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,429
Wha--?

301
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,972
Get out of here!

302
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,599
Get out of here?
Why would I get out of here?

303
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,767
You get out of here.
This is my office.

304
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,647
I get the army men are police,

305
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,232
but what's the mustard packet
again?

306
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,067
Oh, that's just
a mustard packet.

307
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,652
- It's left over from lunch.
- Oh.

308
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,070
Well, can we move it
off the table?

309
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,405
No. I still might
want it later.

310
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,656
Good call.

311
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,658
So how do we get
the D from here

312
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,410
all the way up to here?

313
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,119
What, with all these cops
and mustards,

314
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,705
- it's gonna be a pickle.
- Oh, no.

315
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,415
The pickle's a SWAT van,
but I see your point.

316
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:32,669
Might be easier to just ditch
the evidence. But how?

317
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,295
I-- I don't know.

318
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,423
You think these coffees
would get the juices flowing.

319
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,798
Well, they do have Bailey's
in them.

320
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,509
Is that why I feel drunk?

321
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,595
Because I've had, like,
seven or eight coffees.

322
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,137
I mean, I admit,
it's been bad for ideas,

323
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,139
but it's been great
for camaraderie.

324
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,725
Couldn't agree more.

325
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,393
Ooh, hey.
What time is it?

326
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,977
I probably need
to move my helicopter.

327
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,479
It's in a two-hour zone.

328
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,732
You beautiful bastard,
that's it!

329
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,735
We can pick up the D with your
chopper, fly it out of here,

330
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,319
and then dump it
out into the ocean.

331
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,738
Stupendous!

332
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,531
Take that, the ocean.

333
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,324
[phone vibrates and rings]

334
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,577
- What now, Todd?
<i>- Listen.</i>

335
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,829
So, kind of landed myself in a
two-dates-to-the-prom situation.

336
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,166
The dates being prison gangs
and the prom being a jump-in,

337
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,377
so do you remember how you got
out of the same jam

338
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,629
on <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

339

Ah, a classic conundrum.

on <i>Mr. Peanutbutter's House--</i>

341

I think he's talking to me,
pal.

342
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,511
You know, the guy
whose show

343
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,804
invented the
two-dates-to-the-prom story.

344
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,933
You may have invented it, but
I think our show perfected it.

The only thing
you ever perfected

346
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,395
- was stealing my thunder.
- Stealing your thunder, eh?

347
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,272
Now you're even stealing

A Diane thing would be
something that shows

507
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,350
he really knows you,

508
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,603
like giving you an iPod loaded
with all your favorite podcasts,

509
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,229
or a practical houseplant,

510
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,065
or surprising you
with a bound album

511
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,775
of photos and emails
he saved.

512
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,611
That's-- That's what the Diane
I know would want.

513
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,863
What are you saying to me?

514
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,364
Just that you should be

515
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,824
with someone
who knows you.

516
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,035
Yeah? Like who?

517
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,911
- I--
- [device beeps]

518
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,454
Whoa, were we--
Were we taping?

519
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,873
Um, okay.

520
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,624
Uh, you want to hear
my Andy Dick story?

521
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,250
It's a doozie.

522
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,964
All we ask for is 10%
of anything pilfered.

523
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,175
Drugs, cigarettes.

524
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,843
I mean, that's the standard
gang rate.

525
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:24,348
Hey, I got to go, uh,
do a prison thing.

526
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,476
That sounds legitimate.
We are in prison, after all.

527
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,520
[panting]

528
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,313
Whew. Hey.

529
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,607
White people, right?

530
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,610
Todd? Why in the name
of Pat Buchanan

531
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,779
are you dressed
like a Latin King?

532
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,322
- Uh, what--
- What the hell, bro?

533
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,324
- Are you playing both sides?
- Look, guys,

534
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,786
I didn't want to choose between
you because I like you both.

535
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,955
Look, in fact, if you just
took the time

536
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,875
to get to know each other
the way you did me,

537
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,377
I think you'd agree
we don't need gangs anymore

538
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,340
because, deep down,
we're all just people.

539
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,176
What do you say?

540
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,803
<i>This just in.</i>
<i>A standoff at the Super Max</i>

541
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,723

[cell phone vibrating]

546
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,861
Diane? Is that you?

547
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,116
Hey. It's, um, me.

548
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,533
[nervously laughs]

549
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,911
Look, uh, things got
a bit weird earlier,

550
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,496
so I-- I want to make sure
that we're still on for tomorrow

551
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,999
to talk about the time
I sneezed on Marisa Tomei.

552
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,834
I'm really sorry
about before.

553
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,586
I know the D was overkill,

554
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,214
so I got you something
more personal.

555
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,632
Aww.

556
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,426
I also wanted to just, um,
let you know

557
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,762
how much I appreciate you
working on this book with me.

558
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:50,017
I know I sometimes
get carried away,

559
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,811
but it's because
I love you so much.

560
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,771
You're a catch, Diane,

561
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,607
and I think you know
how much I love catch.

562
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,152
And I'm sorry if I've been
difficult in any way

563
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,903
during this process.

564
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,613
You know, it's-- It's really hard
to have somebody,

565
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,283
I don't know, know you,
I guess.

566
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,827
And you do, uh,
know me, Diane.

567
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,496
We're very different,
but I think we bring out

568
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,123
the best in each other.

569
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,833
It's like you're chocolate
and I'm--

570
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,709
- Peanutbutter?
- [laughs] What? Now see?

571
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,004
That was so much better
than what I was gonna say.

572
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,132
- I was gonna say carrots.
- [laughs]

573
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,758
And I know I'm not
the perfect guy.

574
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,220
I actually kind of hate myself
a lot of the time.

575
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,057
But when-- When I'm with you,
I, uh, don't hate myself.

576
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,518
I like being around you,

577
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,061
and I don't know
if I ever told you that

578
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,023
in so many words,
so I'm telling you.

579
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:40,151
Diane, I've got an important
question to ask.

580
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,737
No cameras,
no big spectacle.

581
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,739
Just me and you.

582
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,200
Call me back.

583
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,160
This was BoJack,
by the way.

584
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,744
Horseman, obviously.

585
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,663
Will you do the honor...

586
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,914
[cell phone chimes]

587
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,042
...of becoming
Mrs. Peanutbutter?

588
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:00,129
Wow. This is happening
so fast.

589
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,631
Yes. I'll marry you.

590
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,133
But I'm keeping
my last name.

591
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,969
You hear that?
She said yes!

592
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,386
- Let's kick it!
- [festive music plays]

593
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,388
Erica, did you hear
she said yes?

594
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,226
Come on in here!
All right!

595
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,311
[fireworks pop and crackle]

596
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:18,147
She's not gonna call.
Get out the consolation scotch.

00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,732
[vibrates]

598
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,359
It's her!
Make that celebration scotch.

599
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,652
- What's the difference?
- It's the same scotch!

600
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,904
Diane! Hey, you!

601
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,655
Hey.

602
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,448
So this is weird.

603
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,244
I'm engaged.

604
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,329
Oh, wow.

605
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,331
To Mr. Peanutbutter?

606
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,666
I saw you left me
a voicemail--

607
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,626
Delete it. It's just a drunken
recipe for Bundt cake.

608
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,878
Not important.

609
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,338
Okay. I got to go.

610
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,006
They're about to move
the D back.

611
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,717
- See you tomorrow?
- Absolutely.

612
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:52,514
Well, nobody knows me
like you.
