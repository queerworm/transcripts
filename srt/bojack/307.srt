-No.

162
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,085
-You don't remember BoJack?
-Oh, yeah. BoJack.

163
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,338
What... why... What are you here?
Why are you doing at Todd's house?

164
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,923
Todd's house? This is my house.

165
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,593
It's cool if we set up shop here, right?
That's not gonna be weird?

166
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,220
What? Why would that be weird?

167
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,222
-What are you implying?
-Nothing.

168
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,308
It's not weird for me either,
if we're keeping track of weirdnesses.

169
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,688
-Okay, what is going on here?
-Why would you? I don't even--

170
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,982
-Literally nothing going on.
-No, something's going on.

171
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,650
I've got a nose for news.

172
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,528
In this case, Nu is the Greek letter
representing the variable

173
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,946
for "What Is Going On?"

174
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,240
So let's solve for Nu, shall we?

175
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:39,078
I think someone's not saying something
to someone else about something.

176
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,456
-That's crazy.
-I know what it is.

177
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,333
Cabracadabra's going to be huge.

178
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,461
No one wants to say it out loud
because we're afraid we'll jinx it.

179
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,006
Yeah. That is exactly what it is.

180
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,675
Yes. Your stupid business
is gonna be very successful.

181
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,260
-Yes.
-Glad that's out in the open.

182
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,887
We all know what everyone was thinking,
we don't need to ask

183
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,098
any more questions
or do any wondering about mysteries.

184
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,016
Nope.

185
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,227
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go watch a sport.

186
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,478
Great idea.

187
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,648
The worst part is things have actually
been going really well with Todd.

188
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,734
Our friendship is in a really good place.

189
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,776
Last week he said,

190
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,613
"Did you know the wiener dog
is neither a wiener nor a dog?"

191
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,574
Instead of saying,
"Shut up, Todd," I said, "Okay."

192
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,826
[The Closer] <i>So, why did you</i>
<i>sleep with Emily?</i>

193
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:22,747
<i>Do you think that part of you was getting</i>
<i>uncomfortable with that closeness?</i>

194
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,499
<i>You felt like you didn't deserve</i>
<i>Todd's friendship</i>

195
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,545
<i>and you wanted to somehow</i>
<i>externalize that feeling into action?</i>

196
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,174
No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.
Can't it just be that?

197
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,717
When you do bad things,

198
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,471
you have something you can point to
when people eventually leave you.

199
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,308
It's not you, you tell yourself,
it's that bad thing you did.

200
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,727
<i>Do you often keep people at arm's length?</i>

201
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,522
<i>Are you afraid of being known</i>
<i>and knowing others?</i>

202
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,484
Yeah, you know, I think that you're
definitely hitting on something real

203
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,569
that I would love to drill down into,

204
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,030
but I gotta go
to this marketing meeting now.

205
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,200
Which is so annoying
because I totally want to keep talking

206
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,951
about that thing you're talking about.

207
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,536
But marketing meetings, right?

208
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,289
I mean, they're so important.
Can I call you back tomorrow?

209
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,208
<i>-Of course.</i>
-Great. Bye.

210
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,254
<i>-So, how was your marketing meeting?</i>
-Weird.

211
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,466
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine. We're just getting started.

212
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,093
I had the worst morning.

213
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,844
Hanging on every word. Don't tell us.

214
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,262
So I drove here, right?

215
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,350
<i>I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage</i>
<i>when I realize I don't have my key card.</i>

216
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,519
<i>I gotta drive all the way home to get it.</i>

217
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,271
<i>When I got there,</i>
<i>I couldn't find it anywhere.</i>

218
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,525
<i>Suddenly, I remember:</i>
<i>I put it in the glove compartment.</i>

219
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,652
<i>It was in my car the entire time.</i>

220
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,903
Okay.

221
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,198
Because I was driving back and forth
so much, I ran out of gas.

222
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,741
I pulled into a 76.

223
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,869
I was about to pump the gas,
I realized I didn't have my credit card,

224
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,122
when I remembered
it was on my desk at home

225
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,707
because I used it to contribute to
my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.

226
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,625
Diane...

227
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,336
Have you donated
to Virginia's dumb Kickstarter yet?

228
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,339
-Oh, shit.
-Throw her 50 bucks. You can afford it.

229
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,050
Yeah, but I don't like feeling
like I have to, Roxy.

230
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,386
Does the world need
a stop-motion short film

231
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,263
about a pig who goes to circus school?

232
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,141
Think of it like you're doing
a nice thing for your friend.

233
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,642
Mmm... okay.

234
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,562
<i>I called a cab to take me home</i>
<i>to get my credit card.</i>

235
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,065
Then back to the gas station, get my car,
fill it up and come here.

236
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,192
So that's why I'm late.

237
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,154
-Why did you tell us that whole story?
-I don't know.

238
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,324
-Why did you tell me that whole story?
-I don't know.

239
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:27,037
Anyway, I had the ad agency whip up
some options for the new <i>Secretariat </i>ads.

240
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,040
Good news is the movie
is killing out there. Everyone loves it.

241
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,668
If everyone loves it,
why do we need a new ad campaign?

242
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,045
These are
the "For Your Consideration" ads.

243
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,841
They're a reminder to the Academy,
"Have you considered this yet?"

244
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,427
The Academy doesn't always
consider everything.

245
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,971
So they need constant
consideration reminders.

246
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,182
-That's very considerate.
-This one tested the best.

247
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,434
That's a good one.
The rest of these suck.

248
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,811
Dumb. Dumb. Stupid. Offensive.

249
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,938
Ugly. Boring. Typical. Stupid.

250
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,608
Bad. Hideous. Disgusting. Gross. Cliché.

251
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,693
-I am really good at this.
-Huh.

252
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,822
-I kind of like this one.
-How'd that piece of crap get in there?

253
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,073
We ruled that one out.

254
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,575
It's actually really powerful.

255
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,536
[The Closer] <i>What spoke to you</i>
<i>about </i>that <i>particular ad?</i>

256
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,913
[BoJack] <i>I don't know.</i>

257
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,582
<i>All the pictures of me,</i>
<i>they looked backwards.</i>

258
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:15,211
<i>When I looked at the mirror ad,</i>
<i>I was seeing me as I see myself</i>

259
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,796
<i>and I thought</i>
<i>there was something beautiful about that.</i>

260
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,381
<i>Intimate, almost.</i>

261
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,634
Of course you like this ad.
When you look at it

262
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,677
you see Secretariat, I see an old turtle.

263
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,097
"Hello, old turtle. Are you Secretariat?
No? You're just some old turtle?

264
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,935
-What the hell? You've aged terribly."
-But you've got the heart of a champion.

265
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,395
I got a team of cardiologists at Cedars
who say different.

266
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,190
Isn't that the point of the movie,
that anybody could be Secretariat?

267
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,527
The point of the movie is to make
a lot of money and win awards.

268
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,779
If anyone who looks at this ad
is Secretariat,

269
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,405
why should you win the Oscar?

270
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,868
He's right, BoJack. Why don't you
leave this to the experts, okay?

271
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,082
-Yes. You're a star.
-[moaning]

272
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,252
[The Closer]
<i>So, you also had sex with your publicist?</i>

273
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,921
[BoJack] <i>Yeah, couple times.</i>
<i>We have a very complicated relationship.</i>

274
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,214
It's complicated.

275
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:04,093
If our relationship was a Meryl Streep
movie, it would be <i>Doubt.</i>

276
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,887
Don't forget, you have <i>Ellen</i> tomorrow.

277
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,514
Don't wear that sweater I hate.

278
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,350
Yes. You're in charge.

279
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,979
Okay, you know, I gotta say
I don't feel like I'm in charge.

280
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,648
If you're gonna throw a tantrum,
forget the whole thing.

281
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,609
I'm not throwing a tantrum-- Why are we
having sex in my car?

282
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,195
-Can we at least go back to your place?
-No, BoJack.

283
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,864
I don't know where you live.

284
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,992
You control every part of my life,
I don't know anything about you.

285
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:28,909
[scoffs]

286
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,620
-You don't want to know me, BoJack.
-No, I do.

287
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,456
-I want to be known and know others.
-You don't.

288
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,004
I know you and I know what you want.
This is exactly what you want.

289
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,464
[The Closer]
<i>What do you think she meant by that?</i>

290
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,259
Better question:
Why am I still getting the <i>L.A. Gazette?</i>

291
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:50,431
Do you think getting the paper every day
is a reminder of Todd's papier-mâché head?

292
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,351
<i>The project he abandoned</i>
<i>to make time for the old girlfriend</i>

293
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,562
<i>you spent an intimate night with?</i>

294
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,065
Could that be why you want
to cancel your subscription?

295
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,527
No. I want to cancel my subscription
because newspapers are dumb.

296
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,446
I feel I'm very clear on this point.

297
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,740
Every morning,
someone knocks on my door and says,

298
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,366
"Throw away this garbage for me."

299
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,453
So you don't feel any guilt
about your tryst with Emily?

300
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,289
Well, I have had trouble sleeping.

301
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,749
[Emily and Todd laughing]

302
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,459
[Todd] You're silly.
[Emily] No, you're silly.

303
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,460
Oh, God.

304
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,379
-Okay, your turn, truth or dare.
-Truth.

305
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:27,092
What is the worst recent thing you did
to someone who cared about you?

306
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,804
-The worst thing? Or the most recent?
-Both.

307
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,641
Can you keep it down, please?
Some people are trying to sleep.

308
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,851
-We are keeping it down.
-We've been really quiet.

309
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,394
-You're basically shouting.
-Sorry.

310
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,857
-Do you want me to whisper? Like this?
-Yeah, we can be real whispery.

311
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,068
No, because then I'll hear the
"psst, psst, psst."

312
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,779
And I'll be up all night
wondering what you're talking about.

313
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,615
-Uh, what would we be talking about?
-Yeah, BoJack.

314
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,659
What would we be talking about?

315
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,327
I don't know. Dumb stuff.

316
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,205
Forget it. Can't sleep here.
I'm gonna go sleep in my boat.

317
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,050
[sighing]

318
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,180
-Freeze, candy ass.
-[gasping]

319
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,766
-Character Actress Margo Mart--?
-I said, "Freeze."

320
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,144
[The Closer] <i>Hold on. Are you telling me</i>
<i>esteemed character actress</i>

321
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,983
<i>and fugitive from the law Margo Martindale</i>
<i>has been living in your boat?</i>

322
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,236
Is this one of those situations where
everything we discuss is confidential,

323
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,154
due to customer
service rep-client privilege?

324
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,531
Of course.

325
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,700
Then yes,
Margo Martindale is living in my boat.

326
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,705
-How long have you been in here?
-Well, after the incident in Yorba Linda.

327
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,873
[yelling]

328
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,337
-[moaning]
-Eh...

329
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,880
Well, Margo, old gal,

330
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,258
looks like you've bought yourself
another day of freedom.

331
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,176
But at what cost?

332
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,430
I knew I had to lay low.
Go off the grid, disappear.

333
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,181
I know what "lay low" means.

334
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,309
<i>So, I disappeared for a little bit.</i>

335
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,104
Mm-hmm.

336
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,691
<i>Somewhere I knew I had no chance</i>
<i>of being discovered--</i>

337
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,985
<i>regional theater.</i>

338
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:12,573
<i>I did a run at the La Jolla Playhouse</i>
<i>in an obscure Tennessee Williams play.</i>

339
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,742
I have ambition, sir.

340
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,871
Dreams that don't incorporate
the concerns of cynics like you.

341
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,291
Cynic.
Always laughing that terrible laugh.

342
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,585
-Ramona...
-Well, go ahead and laugh.

343
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,296
Laugh your life away. I can laugh, too.

344
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,882
[laughing]

345
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,133
Ramona, I'm telling you...

346
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,054
[wailing]

347
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,856
She's dead.

348
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,776
[applause]

349
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,028
<i>I was good. Too good.</i>

350
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,448
<i>The </i>San Diego Union-Tribune
<i>called me, "A talent to watch."</i>

351
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,366
<i>I knew I had to get out of there.</i>

352
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,535
And you've been living here ever since?

353
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,080
That's right. I also did an arc
on <i>The Good Wife.</i>

354
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,791
-Other than that, laying low.
-<i>The Good Wife?</i>

355
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,044
How did you go on a nationally broadcast
TV show with no one catching you?

356
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:11,423
I disappeared into the role, BoJack.
It's called acting. Try it sometime.

357
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,634
And you're the one
who's been stealing our food.

358
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,344
You already know too much.

359
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,762
Smoke bomb.
Hi-yah!

360
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,809
-Why did you throw a plum on the floor?
-Thought it was a smoke bomb.

361
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,227
Where are my smoke bombs?

362
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,187
I'm gonna go sleep by the pool.

363
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,732
-Hey. BoJack's back.
-Yup.

364
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,944
My two favorite people
in a room together with me.

365
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,071
-You bet.
-Isn't this great, BoJack?

366
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,989
-The three of us under one roof?
-Yeah.

367
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,033
It's like <i>Three Men and a Baby.</i>

368
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,453
But there's only two men,
and the baby's a lady.

369
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,788
-[laughing]
-Uh-huh.

370
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,419
[yawning]

371
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,963
[chattering]

372
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,757
[sighing]

373
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,599
[The Closer]
<i>With all this turmoil and upheaval,</i>

374
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,394
sure would be nice to have
something you can depend on.

375
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,230
Something that arrives every day
at your doorstep,

376
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,731
with a robust arts section.

377
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,984
Let me tell you something
about the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

378
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,695
<i>I don't think you finished the story</i>
<i>about your publicist.</i>

379
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,115
What happened when you told her
you wanted to know her?

380
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,366
Oh, right. Well...

381
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,536
If we're gonna work together
and also have weird kinky car sex,

382
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,079
I wanna know something about you.

383
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,247
What do you wanna know?

384
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,208
I was married once.
I have a son I'm not allowed to see.

385
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,086
-My favorite fruit is honeydew.
-Gross, is that true?

386
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,045
Does it matter?

387
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,131
Listen, I've been
with guys like you before,

388
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,467
and I know this thing works better
if we keep a little distance.

389
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,510
And...
[grunting]

390
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,805
-[groaning] Well, that worked.
-Okay, we're done. I'll see you tomorrow.

391
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,850
[The Closer]
<i>So, that's how you left things?</i>

392
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,686
[BoJack] <i>That's how she left things.</i>
<i>But then I followed her home.</i>

393
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,062
[The Closer]
<i>You did what?</i>

394
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,607
[BoJack] <i>She lives in this</i>
<i>tiny apartment in the Valley.</i>

395
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,069
<i>I could see her through the window</i>
<i>and I just watched her being... normal.</i>

396
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,363
Oh!
[sighing]

397
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,740
[The Closer]
<i>There's something very intimate</i>

398
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,201
<i>about watching a person be herself.</i>

399
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,078
[BoJack] <i>But it wasn't good intimate,</i>
<i>like when you see your mom cry.</i>

400
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,246
<i>It was bad intimate,</i>

401
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,457
<i>like when your dad writes a poem</i>
<i>about Lena Horne's nipples,</i>

402
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,084
<i>makes you read it out loud</i>
<i>so he can hear if it scans.</i>

403
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,545
[The Closer] <i>She warned you</i>
<i>that you wouldn't want to know her.</i>

404
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,713
[BoJack] <i>Yeah. She was right.</i>

405
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:19,885
<i>It's so sad that when you see someone</i>
<i>as they really are, it ruins them.</i>

406
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,096
-Do you have someone you can talk to?
-About what?

407
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,226
<i>These feelings you have,</i>
<i>your self-destructive behavior.</i>

408
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,103
You know that old joke
about how many psychiatrists

409
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,398
does it take to screw in a light bulb?
The answer is just one,

410
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,859
but the light bulb has to want to change?

411
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,987
-I don't know that joke.
-That's it. That's the whole joke.

412
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,073
The light bulb has to want to change.

413
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,743
[laughing]
Yeah. Psychiatrists are idiots.

414
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,828
<i>That's actually not the point of the joke.</i>

415
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,414
-Hey. I need to talk to you.
-What the... I'm on the phone.

416
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:54,002
I got nominated for the Craig Noel Award
from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle.

417
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,545
Oh, it's too much heat.

418
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,673
I'm taking your boat out
to international waters.

419
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,341
You never saw me.

420
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,801
On the phone.

421
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,552
I don't want to talk to anybody.

422
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,888
What I want is to have control
over my own life.

423
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,973
[engine starting]

424
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,478
Which is why I'm begging you

425
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,981
to please cancel my delivery
of the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

426
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,692
-I don't think you want to do that.
-I promise you I do.

427
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,318
No, because that's just theater.

428
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:23,532
It allows you to think you're in control,
but the whole idea of control is a myth.

429
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,951
The universe is a wild beast.

430
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:30,706
<i>You can't tame it.</i>
<i>All you can do is try to live inside it.</i>

431
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,041
Live inside the beast?
That's a mixed metaphor.

432
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,794
-But... you're right.
<i>-Great.</i>

433
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,380
I'm going to sign you up
for another six months.

434
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,342
Since you've been such a sport,
I'm throwing in a tote bag.

435
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,053
Thanks.
You've given me a lot to think about.

436
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,182
Okay, so I'm a passenger.

437
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,978
Remember the three D's:
drive safely, drive efficiently,

438
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,105
and don't harass the passenger.

439
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:59,526
-Todd, can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure. Driver, pull over, please.

-[imitating car braking]
-[imitating opening door]

441
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,490
-Can I talk to you alone?
-Of course.

442
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,909
Driver, put up the partition, please.

443
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,370
[imitating partition whirring]

444
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,583
I've been thinking,
and you should do this without me.

445
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,127
What? But the whole point
is we're doing it together.

446
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,879
But you don't need me anymore.

447
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,630
You have a whole team of coders,

448
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,717
and I don't think that I can work
in this house.

449
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,635
-What's wrong with the house?
-Todd, I just--

450
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,888
-I need to go.
-[imitating opening door]

451
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,598
I don't understand.

452
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,892
Did I do something
to make you feel uncomfortable?

453
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:36,229
No. You are great. It's me and... BoJack.

454
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,232
BoJack? [sighing]
What did he do this time?

455
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,905
I don't think
I've been a very good friend to you.

456
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,365
Things happened and...

457
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,286
I don't think BoJack's been
a very good friend to you either.

458
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:56,208
-Oh, okay.
-You should buy me out of the company.

459
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,210
No, no, no, keep your share.

460
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,462
Who knows?
It might be worth something someday.

461
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,755
You're sweet, Todd.

462
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,341
You shouldn't waste that on people
who don't deserve it.

463
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,969
Hey, you want this plum?
I found it in the kitchen.

464
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,012
Sure.

465
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,597
-[smoke bomb fizzing]
-[both] Whoa!

466
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,058
[coughing]

467
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,434
Weird plum.

468
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,270
[knocking on door]

469
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,648
How did you know where I live?

470
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,982
-Ana...
-You need to leave.

471
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,777
No, I know that it's exciting
to remain mysterious and in control,

472
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,112
but control is a myth.

473
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,656
That's a conclusion
I came to recently by myself.

474
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,824
I can't do this now.

475
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,701
I don't want to go home tonight.
I want to sleep in your bed,

476
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,787
I wanna see what
you look like waking up.

477
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,249
You are a beautiful,
sexy, fascinating, terrifying woman.

478
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,085
And I want to know you.
I'm not afraid of that.

479
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,920
And you don't have to be, either.

480
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,298
Okay.

481
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,010
And I want to go with the mirror ads
for <i>Secretariat.</i>

482
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,387
-BoJack, no, listen.
-Ana.

483
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,389
This is my campaign,
I know what I'm doing.

484
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,433
Call up Turteltaub and tell him
I won't be pushed around on this.

485
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,394
I'm the star and what I say goes.

486
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,188
Okay.

487
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,440
[cars honking]

488
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,192
[Ana] Hmm...

489
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,945
[Carolyn] It kind of just looks like
a billboard for the sky.

490
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,114
-I didn't think this part through.
-No kidding.

491
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:12,909
The sky is Secretariat? The sky
wants you to nominate it for an Oscar?

492
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,828
It is eerily beautiful.

493
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,455
Like an art piece
that resists interpretation.

494
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,126
Oh, good. Yeah. Wouldn't want the ad
for my movie to be interpretable.

495
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,627
If you stand where I'm standing,

496
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,088
you see a reflection
of the KIIS-FM billboard.

497
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,633
Beautiful. So we spent half a million
dollars on an Oscar campaign for KIIS-FM.

498
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,427
I'd hate to drive here at rush hour.

499
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,096
When the sun goes down
and hits that billboard,

500
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,808
that's gonna--
That's gonna be a real problem.

501
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,978
Well, the good news is
BoJack got what he wanted.

502
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,022

00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,066
