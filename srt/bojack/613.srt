[voicemail] <i>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</i>

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,053
<i>Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</i>
[beeps]

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,054
Hey, Hollyhock.

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,807
Um, you still haven't returned
my last call, which is fine.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,143
I just... I know you're going back
to school soon,

7
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,146
and you should know I won't be there.

8
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,357
Because of... everything
you've probably heard about.

9
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,610
So, if you were worried
you'd have to see me, you won't.

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,070
But I would love to talk.

11
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,448
-It's BoJack.
-[beeps]

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,413
[man] <i>Welcome to Burritos and Mo!</i>
<i>Home of burritos and much, much mo!</i>

13
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:42,375
-Give me a large number three.
<i>-Oh, my God. Ellie! Look at the monitor.</i>

14
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,003
<i>It's fricking BoJack Horseman.</i>
<i>Don't worry, I muted it.</i>

15
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,256
-[Ellie] <i>He looks like crap.</i>
<i>-Yeah. His tie is all loosened up,</i>

16
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,009
<i>which is like the universal sign</i>
<i>for having a shitty day.</i>

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,470
[Ellie] <i>Probably because he just came</i>
<i>from court. It's all over the news.</i>

18
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,639
<i>He just settled with Sarah Lynn's family</i>
<i>for five million dollars.</i>

19
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,184
[man] <i>Makes sense. He seemed like</i>
<i>a real psycho in that interview</i>

20
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,810
<i>-he did a few months back.</i>
-Yeah. Guys.

21
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,146
[Ellie] <i>I'm surprised he'd still</i>
<i>wanna show his face in public.</i>

22
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,481
-Hey!
-[man] <i>His face is everywhere.</i>

23
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,191
<i>-The cover of every magazine.</i>
-Okay.

24
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,985
<i>Even got the number-one slot</i>
<i>for Hundred Most Hatted Men.</i>

25
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,112
-No, it--
-[Ellie] <i>Most Hatted Men? What is that?</i>

26
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,823
[man] <i>List of men in hats, I guess.</i>
<i>He was wearing a fedora.</i>

27
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,116
It was Most Hated Men!

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,284
-[Ellie gasps]
-[man] <i>What?</i>

29
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,287
It was the Hundred Most Hated Men,
it was a newsboy cap,

30
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,122
and I can hear everything
you've been saying!

31
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,415
[Ellie] <i>Uh...</i>

32
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,710
-[man] <i>Get his bags, Ellie!</i>
<i>-You said you muted it!</i>

34
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:32,300
-[man] Have a burrito-ful day!
-[man 2] Hey! [grunts] You suck, asshole!

35
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,637

00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,276
[bleating]

37
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,570
I don't think it's wise
to be burning Bridges at this juncture.

38
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,530
I'm sorry, just don't like Beau.

39
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,115
{\an8}-Greetings, strangers!
-Maude?

40
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,741
{\an8}That's what they want you to think!

41
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,911
{\an8}I'm Maude's twin sister Fergus,
we have never met before,

42
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,831
and I'd be delighted to accept a job
at this company.

43
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,333
{\an8}-[scoffs] What?
-As you know, I have 12 children.

44
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,669
What sort of day care services
do you provide here?

45
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,046
{\an8}Has this ever happened to you?

46
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,590
{\an8}Todd? At the office?

47
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,675
Can we wrap whatever this is up?

48
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,886
{\an8}I'm supposed to head over
to the "Birthday Dad" set.

49
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,554
{\an8}I wanna run a day care at VIM!

50
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,932
{\an8}I've mastered the art of looking
at one baby and I'm ready for more.

51
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,185
You do have several employees
with children.

52
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,769
{\an8}If you employ Todd through the company,

53
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,272
{\an8}you could offer him a raise
and still save money on taxes.

54
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,190
Great. It's done.

55
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,901
{\an8}Hooray! Corporate tax loophole!

56
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,944
{\an8}Plus, we can carpool to the office.

57
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,157
{\an8}Which leads me to my next point.
I am moving out to live with Maude.

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,784
{\an8}It's me! It's Maude.
I don't really have a twin sister.

59
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,662
{\an8}Hey, that's fantastic!
Where are you moving to?

60
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,747
Um...

61
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,833
-You can stay here! Live with me forever!
-[director] Cut!

62
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,461
{\an8}The line is,
"Thank you for the birthday pizza.

63
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,795
{\an8}Today, I am your dad."

64
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,173
-Oh, sorry!
-Let's take five?

65
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,218
{\an8}-Hey, champ. Everything okay?
-I'm just distracted.

66
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,763
{\an8}Ever since Pickles left, I've been
so lonely in that big, empty house.

67
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,891
I've always had a wife or a girlfriend,
someone to take care of.

68
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,851
Princess Carolyn,
you're perpetually alone.

69
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,979
{\an8}-How do you manage?
-One day at a time, buddy.

70
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,065
I went to the doctor to see
if he could make me feel better,

71
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,067
he said, "You should check out
this Internet meme,

72
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,444
it always cheers me up: Sad Dog."

73
00:03:56,527 --> 00:04:00,365
And I said, "But Doctor, I am Sad Dog."

74
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,953
Guys, I'm really sorry
this keeps happening.

75
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,915
When I got home, I found my wife
and daughter had moved out.

76
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,708
All they left behind was this picture.

77
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,419
-Okay. Rude.
-Shh!

78
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,797
It's the stock photo
that came in the frame.

79
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,302
My wife kept asking me to put in a picture
of our family, but I was always too drunk.

80
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,097
But because of all of you
and my sponsor Leo,

81
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,183
I'm no longer just the man
who's not in this picture.

82
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,646
I'm a different, better man
who is also not in this picture.

83
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,022
Who's next?

84
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,817
[sighs]

85
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,320
-Um, okay, I'll speak.
-Ugh.

86
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,406
Things have been pretty brutal
for me lately.

87
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,032
-Most people hate me...
-Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,910
...I just lost five million dollars,
so that's not great.

89
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,163
Could probably use a Leo
of my own right about now.

90
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,582
Wow, tough room.

91
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,961
This AA meeting is a tough room.

92
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:01,592
[sighs]

93
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,886
Hey, I'll be your sponsor.

94
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,179
Oh! Um...

95
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,056
I know what you're thinking,
"Vance Waggoner?

96
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,641
That guy's gonna be my sponsor?

97
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,436
The guy Charlie Sheen
once called 'a little much'?"

98
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,062
-Uh...
-"Vance Waggoner?

99
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,982
That guy's got more domestic assault
convictions than Sean Penn!"

100
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,108
And now you're thinking,

101
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,402
"Did Sean Penn get convicted
of domestic assault

102
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,321
or was it just alleged?
I gotta look that up later."

103
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,780
-I'm sure--
-Now you're thinking,

104
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,742
"Why would someone this cool
and put-together wanna sponsor me,

105
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,036
-dumb slob BoJack Horseman?"
-That's not--

106
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,789
Wait. I've been where you've been, BoJack.
And everyone abandoned me.

107
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,084
If you need someone to talk to,
give me a call, okay?

108
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,672
My number is 555-555-8008.

109
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,966
Because sometimes
life turns you upside-down,

110
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,430
and when you're upside-down,
my number is boobs.

111
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,392
[phone buzzing]

112
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:53,853
-[beeps]
-Hello?

113
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,772
Diane! How are the revisions going?

114
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,941
Good! Usually at this stage
I hate everything I've ever written

115
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,904
and I feel like a worthless hack,
but this book actually isn't terrible.

116
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,406
Great, so when can we expect
the not-terrible sequel,

117
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,117
"Ivy Tran Two: A Tran for All Seasons"?

118
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,788
I don't know, Ivy Tran was fun
but I'm a grown-up writer.

119
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,665
<i>There are other things I wanna write.</i>
<i>Did you know Eleanor Roosevelt--</i>

120
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,085
-Interesting.
-I didn't even tell you the thing.

121
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,754
I know.
I was interested in you not telling me.

122
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,963
Okay, good bit.

123
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:21,923
In the meantime,

124
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,676
if you're interested in writing books
that people actually read,

125
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,389
you'll get to work on "Ivy Tran Two:
Last Tran to Clarksville."

126
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,307
-Eleanor Roosevelt once--
<i>-Interesting!</i>

<i>turd-weasels</i>

-[beeps]
-Yes?

140
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,010
BoJack, it's your very good
accountant Gaz.

141
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,471
-I'm here with...
-Your very good lawyer Chaz!

142
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:11,931
Okay.

143
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,767
The good news is the Sarah Lynn settlement
isn't gonna kill us.

144
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,726
What's the bad news?

145
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,604
The bad news is you're being sued
for a hundred million dollars.

146
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,648
-What?
-Remember in your interview,

147
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,986
when you disparagingly referred
to yourself as "a Xerox of a Xerox"?

148
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,904
The Xerox Corporation did not appreciate

149
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,282
being implicated
in your untoward behavior.

150
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,660
Just so I'm clear, Sarah Lynn's death
cost me five million dollars,

151
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:36,372
but saying something bad about a brand
is gonna cost me a hundred million?

152
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,833
When you frame it that way,
it almost seems comical!

153
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,168
But it is not comical,

154
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,254
because a hundred million dollars
is a lot of money you do not have.

155
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,505
Okay, so what's the move?

156
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,175
-Funny you should mention "move."
-[doorbell rings]

157
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,385
Your accountant told me
 you wanted to sell your house?

158
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,971
-Okay, I'm gonna call you back.
-So, I sold your house!

159
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,390
Wow-ee! It looks better than the pictures!

160
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,350
-You sold my house?
-Golly, are you...?

162
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,771
Oh! Hey, you kids wanna go check out
the pool?

163
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,315
-[boy] Yeah!
-[girl] I love my new life!

164
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,232
You sold my house?

165
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,862
I found this sweet, sweet family from Ohio
whose kid just got cast in a movie!

166
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,739
I wanted to make sure the ink dried
on the mortgage

167
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,992
before they find out the movie's
being shot in Saskatchewan. [chuckles]

168
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:13,993
So, where do I go?

169
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,120
What do I look like, a real estate agent?

170
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,289
-Wait.
-Yeah?

171
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,499
Your mail came.

172
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,543
-Now leave. You're harshing the buzz.
-But...

173
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,091
Huh?

174
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:49,612
-Well, I'm all moved in.
-[sighs] Me too.

175
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,617
Wow! Got a promotion
and my own apartment all in the same day.

176
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,163
-I never realized my boyfriend was butter.
-You're right. I am on a roll!

177
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,540
What should I do next?

178
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,499
[ringing]

179
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,752
Chavez residence, this is Jorge.
Please state the purpose of your call

180
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,129
so I can most appropriately
modulate my tone.

181
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,423
Hey, it's Todd. Is Mom there?

182
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,300
Ah! Todd! Yes.

183
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,095
Oh. She's resting at the moment.
Can I take a message?

184
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,890
I just wanted her to know that
I don't have anything to prove to her,

185
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,643
but I got a new job and an apartment,

186
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,312
so if I did have something
to prove to her,

187
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,107
-I'd have proven it by now.
-Well, that's wonderful, Todd.

188
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,694
Yes. And quite mature.
And she won't even talk to me.

189
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,280
-Does she know I'm butter?
-I'm glad to hear you're on a roll.

190
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,990
We'd love to see your home
once you're settled.

191
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,535
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm settled! I'm a grown-ass Todd!

192
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,204
-No, I just meant--
-I don't need to impress you!

193
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,748
Why don't you come
to my fancy, sophisticated

194
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,168
housewarming party tomorrow night
and see for yourself!

195
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,004
Consider us there. What can we bring?

196
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,964
-Two chairs!
-[beeps]

197
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,049
We could throw together a party, right?

198
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,759
Um...

199
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,803
-No.
-I need a job.

200
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,762
There are no offers.

201
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,474
-Can you check? Ask around?
-I'm checking. I'm asking around.

202
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,520
-[gasps] There are no offers.
-But I'm broke and homeless.

203
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,982
[scoffs] I can get you a small role
on "Birthday Dad."

204
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,943
Great. Have my pages delivered
to me at the Chateau Marmoset.

205
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,529
-You just said you're broke!
-And homeless.

206
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,531
You are not staying at a fancy hotel.

207
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,991
Who else would have me?

208
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,827
You could stay here! Live with me forever!

209
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,038
[sighs]

210
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,458
-[sizzling]
-[Mr. Peanutbutter humming]

211
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,961
And flip! Morning, sunshine!

212
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,921
I hope I didn't wake you
with the delicious smell

213
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,298
of a well-balanced breakfast.

214
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,009
-Less talky. More coffee.
-You got it, roomie!

215
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,178
-Coffee maker, make!
-[beeps]

216
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,640
Took the liberty of doing your laundry
and this letter was in your pocket.

217
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,643
-[gasps, screams]
-Ooh-hoo! A mysterious pen pal!

218
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,812
Is it a secret admirer
or the snowman killer still at large?

219
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,689
It's from Hollyhock. But... [sighs]

220
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,901
I can't open it. What if she says
she never wants to hear from me again?

221
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:56,155
Or maybe it says "I got rid of my TV
three months ago. What's new, BoJack?"

222
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,531
I should just call her.

223
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,909
If I could talk to her,
I feel like I could explain that--

224
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,496
[voicemail] <i>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</i>
<i>Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</i>

225
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,665
-[voicemail beeps]
-Hey, Hollyhock. It's me again.

226
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,084
And his good friend and roommate
and coworker, Mr. Peanutbutter!

227
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,710
It's our first day of work together!

228
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,837
I got your letter
and I haven't read it yet,

229
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,839
but I'm going to and...

230
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,343
It's really great to hear your voice...
your voicemail voice.

231
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,553
-Just give me a call. It's BoJack.
-[beeps]

232
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,722
-Ready to go?
-What about this breakfast?

233
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,393
We don't have time for that!
You can feed me while I drive, let's go!

234
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,730
<i>-♪ Precision... ♪</i>
-[Todd] Oh, whoa!

235
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,650
-Easy. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop!
-[kids giggling]

236
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,694
Hey, Judah. I need your advice.

237
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,946
I'm trying to throw
a sophisticated adult party

238
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,072
to impress my parents

239
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,325
and I have no furniture
or sophisticated adult friends.

240
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,413
I'm alarmed. Do you not consider me
a sophisticated adult or a friend?

241
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,457
Judah, this is no time for one
of your famous Judah tantrums!

242
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,752
 Sounds like you need to throw together
a scheme in a short amount of time.

243
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,421
In situations like this, I often think,

244
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,005
-"What would Todd do?"
-And?

245
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,549
He'd probably scour VIM's talent list

246
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,592
for underemployed actors,
tell them they've been hired

247
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,554
for a site-specific immersive
theater piece as cosmopolitan partygoers,

248
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,390
invite just enough real friends
to lend it an air of legitimacy

249
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,891
and raid the "Birthday Dad" set
for furniture.

250
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,270
That's brilliant!
Todd, I've done it again!

251
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,647
-Let's go, babies!
-[giggling]

252
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,608
Uh... Babies. Come on!

253
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,360
-[trunk trumpets]
-[giggling continues]

254
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,364
War.

255
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,450
And for what?

256
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,869
-A couple trophies? A parade?
-[BoJack groans]

257
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,121
No. Not for me.

258
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,248
Maybe I'm just a crazy,
old birthday person,

259
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,584
-but I think war is bad.
-[bell rings]

260
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,171
Great job, Mr. Peanutbutter.
You're changing hearts and minds.

261
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,339
Isn't this great? Working together?

262
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,550
For the next take,
can we get Dead Body Number Four

263
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,427
to face away from the camera?

264
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,970
-Oh! That's you!
-Yeah.

265
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,806
-Exciting!
-[grunts, groans]

266
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,600
[director] All the way away
from the camera.

267
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,477
[grunts, groans]

268
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,978
[muffled] I can't really breathe.

269
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,314
That's okay. Let's run it again.

270
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,276
-[screams]
-Cool dressing room.

271
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,652
And great work on that scene.

272
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,197
You really seemed like
a hollowed-out corpse.

273
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,157
Once animated by the fire of life,

274
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,952
now consumed by horror
and regret, and for what?

275
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,078
Great. You wanna get dinner?

276
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,207
Oh, I'd love to, buddy,
but I have like five more scenes to shoot.

277
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,127
Oh. Of course, yeah.
I'll see you back at the house then?

278
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:19,256
Yeah. Oh! I'm probably going to head
right to Todd's fancy party after work.

279
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,716
Todd's having a fancy party?

280
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,384
Mr. Peanutbutter,
we're ready for the scene

281
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,970
where you help an American soldier
and a Taliban insurgent

282
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,639
realize they both have the same birthday.

283
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,225
-It's Christmas.
-Ugh.

284
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,983
[line ringing]

285
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,443
BoJack!

286
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,487
[Todd] Greetings, cast!

287
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,404
As you know,

288
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,200
you have been hired to play urbane,
civilized party guests.

289
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,077
So, if at any point tonight

290
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,746
a "member of the audience"
tries to talk to you,

291
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,374
please say one
of the three following phrases

292
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,918
that elegant adults say all the time:

293
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:01,215
"I'm starting to think smart phones
are actually making us less connected."

294
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:05,135
-Oh, yeah!
-"Well, that's politics for you!"

295
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:10,808
Or, "Sir, you cannot remove your shoes
inside this Applebee's."

296
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,184
[all] Ooh!

297
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,061
-Hey!
-Hello.

298
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,062
What's that?

299
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,607
It's a case of Ass-Jolt,
Pickles' favorite alcoholic energy drink.

300
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,402
I don't need them anymore.

301
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,697
-Oh, fish, I forgot a gift.
-You have two options.

302
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,199
This sourdough starter
or a haiku I wrote on a grain of rice

303
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,368
-and then suspended in a bottle.
-Uh...

304
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,370
Why don't we just say
they're both from both of us?

305
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,538
Yeah.

306
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,750
-[woman gasps] Ugh.
-And you don't wanna open it?

307
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,545
I'm not ready. As long as I don't read it,
she's still in my life.

308
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,590
It's good to have people that remind us
why we stay sober.

309
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,300
That's what my daughter is for me.

310
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,846
Here's your sandwich.
Chef made it just for you.

311
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,848
Hmph, hmph, hmph.

312
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,101
Okay, do I have a horn?

313
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,062
Because everybody keeps looking at me
like I'm some kind of freak.

314
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,274
Well, if you've got a horn,
you're the ugliest unicorn I ever saw.

315
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,443
You'd be kicked out of the unicorn kingdom

316
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:06,030
because you couldn't get a date
to the marshmallow cotillion.

317
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,033
Yeah, or because I snorted up
all the magic fairy glitter.

318
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,493
[deep voice] "This summer:
Dumbass Unicorn."

319
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,496
[chuckles] That's so stupid.
No, that's exactly what they'd do.

320
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,292
It would be like
"Nasty Unicorn: The Unicorn Who Parties."

321
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,502
[normal voice] Yeah, and his horn
is like a corkscrew,

322
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,172
and he tries to open a bottle of wine,
but it gets stuck,

323
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,382
so now he's got this wine bottle
on his head,

324
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,009
just dripping wine down his face,

325
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,094
-like... [grunting]
-[laughing]

326
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,346
"Nasty Unicorn.

327
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,306
He puts the 'U' in 'Eff you.'"

328
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:36,143
Okay, but it wouldn't be "Nasty Unicorn."
It would be "Horny Unicorn"!

329
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,646
Oh, shit, that's amazing.
Now we have to do it.

330
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,230
[chuckles] What do you mean "do it"?

331
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,359
The movie. You're the Horny Unicorn.
I'll direct. We're doing it.

332
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,737
Yeah. I'm not really the guy
people wanna see in movies right now.

333
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,282
Yeah, they don't wanna see you
be <i>Secretariat</i> or raising orphans.

334
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,242
But they will see you be a rude dude

335
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,454
who says all the things polite society
is too limp-dicked to say.

336
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,540
This is your way back in.
This is how you get that love back.

337
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,833
"The Horny Unicorn"?

338
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,671
Yeah, 'cause deep down, he's wounded.
He's misunderstood.

339
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,255
It's not his fault he's the way he is!

340
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,341
-And people are gonna see that!
-Yeah?

341
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,261
Yeah! He's like, "Hey, buddy!
I never asked to be the horny unicorn!

342
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,889
What? You think I like it that
I gotta jizz rainbows every 20 minutes

343
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,391
to keep my horn from going soft?"

344
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,267
[chuckles] I don't know.

345
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,395
Come on. I know you need the money.

346
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,605
When are you gonna stop
punishing yourself?

347
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,360
[video game noises]

348
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,947
Flip it. No, you gotta... [sighs]
Flip the thing. Flip it.

349
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,741
Hey, Sonny, do you know
where the advance copy of my book is?

350
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,201
Your stupid book about the mall?

351
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,704
Haven't seen it.
'Cause I would never even notice it.

352
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,832
-'Cause it's for losers. Girl losers.
-[laughing]

353
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,375
You can just say losers.

354
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,753
Girls can be losers without specifying
that they're girls.

355
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,631
Will you let me know if you see it?
I need to get revisions to my publisher.

356
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,758
[chuckles] Sounds like a "you" problem.

357
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,343
[sniggering]

358
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,511
Girl loser.

359
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,101
-[piano music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

360
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,353
-Hello.
-We're here for the party?

361
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,563
We brought a plant.

362
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,274
Uh, just one sec.

363
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,070
I'm starting to think smart phones
are actually making us less connected.

364
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,906
-They are!
-Well, that's politics for you.

365
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,243
-It is!
-Hey, man. Uh...

366
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,620
-What's going on?
-We're here for the party.

367
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,997
We brought a plant.

368
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,001
Look... [sighs] BoJack,
don't make me ask you to leave.

369
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,836
-You don't have to--
-Come on, dude. Let us in.

370
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,213
-This plant's heavy as tits.
-I don't want a whole thing here.

371
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,884
My mom is coming
and I haven't spoken to her in ten years,

372
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,802
and I can't risk anything happening.

373
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,554
What do you think is going to "happen"?

374
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,766
I don't know, man,
but something always happens with you

375
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:44,188
and usually I've been cool because I know
you're always dealing with your own shit,

376
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,981
but I can't risk it tonight.

377
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,817
I'm sober. Nothing is going to happen.

378
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,944
Yeah, bro, what do you think's gonna--
Oh, shit.

379
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,154
Ugh!

380
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,741
I'll see you around.

381
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,496
We spent like 30 bucks on that plant.

382
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:08,170
Yes, I have made mistakes. So, now what?
I'm just supposed to go away forever?

383
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,922
I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.

384
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,299
This is where you find out
who your real friends are.

385
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,094
Part of being sober is leaving behind
all the people

386
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,429
who can't stop seeing you as the person
who pissed in the fountain

387
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,515
-at my own daughter's sweet 16.
-Yeah?

388
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,185
You think you owe them something
because they tolerated you at your worst,

389
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,064
but these people enjoy seeing you fail
because it lets them feel superior.

390
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,234
They don't know how to process it
when you're no longer the huge screw-up

391
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,362
who hijacked a Meals On Wheels van
to bring my friends to a strip club.

392
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,156
-I don't know--
-I do. You know what else I know?

393
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,991
You gotta go where the love is.

394
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,077
Yeah. Maybe.

395
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,287
That's why we gotta make "Horny Unicorn."

396
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,999
Because it's gonna make a billion dollars
and drive all those assholes crazy!

397
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,168
It would be good to have something
to keep me busy.

398
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,962
See? That's what I'm talking about!

399
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,339
-There he is! There's my Horn-corn!
-[phone buzzing]

400
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,592
-Ah, shit. My daughter's in trouble.
-What is it?

401
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,469
You mind if we swing by EWE.S.C.
real quick?

402
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,596
EWE.S.C.? I'm trying to keep
a low profile.

403
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,558
-I don't think a college campus--
-BoJack, this is my daughter, okay?

404
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,310
She's the one person I care about,
the one thing keeping me sober.

405
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,563
-Why do you need me to go with you?
-Unbelievable.

406
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,731
When everyone else abandoned you,
who was there for you?

407
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,650
When the world judged you
and ridiculed you?

408
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,861
And now, the one time
I need something from you...

409
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,237
Okay. I'm in.

410
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,948
Or as the horny unicorn would say,
"Am I in?"

411
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,033
Oh, you're in, baby!

412
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,412
[video game noises]

413
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,040
No. No. Come on, come on,
come on! Come on!

414
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,419
-What the hell, Diane?
-Ah! I'm working! I'm just taking a break.

415
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,089
-Oh, you found my book?
-Yeah, and it sucked. Totally unrealistic.

416
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,049
-You read my book?
-I've been reading it.

417
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,010
Obviously, I wasn't gonna say it
in front of my friends,

418
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,346
because it's a book for girl babies,
but anyways it didn't even make sense!

419
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,264
What do you mean?

420
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,560
Like, you say the book takes place
in Chicago, but Ivy lives in Schaumburg.

421
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,855
Schaumburg, Diane?
Schaumburg's not Chicago.

422
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,106
It's in the Chicago metropolitan--

423
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,027
Oh, my God, what's next?!
Evanston, Chicago?

424
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:59,448
Morton Grove, Chicago?
Naperville, Chicago?

425
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,993
-That's what you sound like!
-Okay, it's not too late to change it.

426
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,369
Good. And while you're at it,

427
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,705
-I've got some other questions.
-Yeah?

428
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:10,417
Like, okay. When Ivy told Moose
that he wasn't her best friend anymore

429
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,920
and Moose said,
"You're still <i>my</i> best friend

430
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,255
whether you like it or not..." [sniffs]

431
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,049
-was that real?
-What do you mean?

432
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,342
Like, did that really happen,

433
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,802
that someone could be
someone's best friend still

434
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,429
even when they're disappointed in them?

435
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,474
Um, yeah, Sonny, that's real.

436
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,353
Okay. And you know how Ivy
kept her dad's watch in her locker

437
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,940
because even though he wasn't around
she still knew that he loved her?

438
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,235
-Was that real, too?
-Well, the book is fiction.

439
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,072
Yeah, no, I get it, I just...
parts of it felt real, you know?

440
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,406
Yeah. I know.

441
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,576
It's cool that you wrote a book.
I mean, I think girls are gonna like it.

442
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,329
Especially girls who, like,
don't have good self-esteem.

443
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,665
-I hope so.
-So, when's the next one coming out?

444
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,168
Just in case you need me to check it
for other mistakes, you know. [sniffs]

445
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:58,340
Well, if I get started right away,
it should be out by next fall.

446
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,385
-Cool. You gotta flip it.
-Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit!

447
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,890
-Jagger! Jagger!
-Shh, shh.

448
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,892
Hey, hey, hey, keep it down maybe?

449
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,770
Oh, my God, Dad,
is this seriously happening?

450
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,730
-Why are you here?
-You knew what you were doing

451
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,399
when you liked
your mother's Instagram post

452
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,150
of her on the beach
with her new boyfriend.

453
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,111
-What?
-It was a good picture!

454
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,195
That's why we're here?

455
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,365
Every month,
you get five Instagram likes on my account

456
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,033
and five on your mother's account.

457
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,368
You heard what the judge mandated!

458
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,328
Hey, man, let's just go. Okay?
People are starting to--

459
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,997
-Are you BoJack Horseman?
-No.

460
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,290
-Yeah, you are.
-NoJack.

461
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,418
Were you trying to get my attention?
'Cause you got it now, baby!

462
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,712
-Dad!
-The story got picked up by TMZ!

463
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,796
You're ruining my life!

464
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,631
You're making me look like
a real cuck, Jagger.

465
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,967
I'm getting cucked by my own daughter!

466
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,969
You don't even know what that word means!

467
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,304
I just want you to know,

468
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,306
-I think you got a real bum deal.
-Oh, yeah?

469
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,683
You got massively sandbagged
in that interview, bro.

470
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,270
-You were trying to apologize.
-Thank you.

471
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,815
Everything these days is all
"patriarchy" this and "male gaze" that.

472
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,109
And, well, I think it's cool
 you're pushing back against that.

473
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,485
Well, no, I'm not pushing back.

474
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:05,615
No, Bo, I'm saying it's cool.
You can relax here. This is a safe space.

475
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,492
-Okay.
-You're embarrassing me!

476
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,369
Oh, yeah? How's this for embarrassing?

477
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:15,250
Your last spon-con post for L'Oréal?
It came off as disingenuous!

478
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,503
[gasps] You know I love my wide array
of L'Oréal products!

479
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,506
From game days with the gals
to cram sessions at the creamery,

480
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,343
L'Oréal gives me the confidence
to shine my brightest!

481
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,011
Do you wanna come back to Delta House?

482
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,930
I think those guys
would be super-stoked to meet you.

483
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,224
-They'd be stoked?
-Super-stoked.

484
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,517
All right, let's get out of here.

485
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,729
My daughter sucks, which is surprising
because I did such a good job raising her.

486
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,314
Let's make one more stop.

487
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,611
-Hey! Looking good!
-Well, that's politics for you!

489
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,864
-Hello?
-Your mother isn't feeling well.

490
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,616
She's still recovering from her surgery.

491
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,867
Oh.

492
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,371
Does that mean you're not coming
to my refined, upscale party

493
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:56,124
that I totally didn't just throw together
only to impress you?

494
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,461
I'm sorry, uh, no.
But thank you for inviting us.

495
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,964
Jorge, I'm trying to connect to her.

496
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,425
I know. Please keep trying.

[beeps]

498
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,724
I'm starting to think that smart phones
are actually making us less connected.

499
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,357
And then I passed out in the pool.
Sploosh!

500
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,026
Luckily, Lindsay Lohan was there
to perform CPR.

501
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,238
She still credits me for being the reason
she got sober... that time.

502
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,864
[chuckles] Wow.

503
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:31,284
-Who's Lindsay Lohan?
-She's a celebrity from the olden days.

504
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,870
Olden days? Jesus.

505
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,247
Hey, look, buddy, I gotta go.

506
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,706
I'm gonna walk this co-ed back
to her room.

507
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,500
'Cause, you know, there's pervs out there.

508
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,502
Are you serious?
You're supposed to be my sponsor.

509
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,421
So, what, I gotta hang out
with you all the time?

510
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,590
Relax, okay? I'll call you tomorrow,
we'll set up "Horny Unicorn."

511
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,175
Enjoy your people.

512
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,760
Okay.

00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,348
-Delete that.
-Come on.

515
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,518
Hey, no. You come on.
I'm not here to be your cool story later.

516
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,311
Okay, sorry.
