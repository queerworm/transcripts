If we just had bigger plates,

we could get more stuff on them

00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,981
-BoJack, no.
-No, it's not fair.

164
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,859
If you start listing every single thing
everyone's done,

165
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,777
-then everyone's a monster.
-Nobody's--

166
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,237
Who are these reporters, anyway?

167
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,823
They're so perfect? I'll bet
there's dirt on them we could dig up!

168
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,534
-I don't think that's it--
-That'll teach those bloodthirsty leeches

169
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,037
what happens when they try to tear
someone down over their past

170
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,789
without even considering the possibility
that he's changed!

171
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,042
-Have you changed?
-Yes, obviously.

172
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,337
Because this feels like old BoJack.

173
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,007
{\an8}I like the BoJack who's thoughtful
and directs plays

174
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,595
{\an8}that are emotionally resonant despite
the glaring logical gaps in the plot.

175
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,182
{\an8}It was a showcase of separate scenes!
There was no plot!

176
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,852
I need to go put Ruthie to bed.
Call me when new BoJack's back.

177
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,646
[door opens, closes]

178
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,275
You didn't do any of the dishes?

179
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,945
Manual labor featuring me
is just not a fruitful collab.

180
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,322
So I just went out
and bought 500 new ones.

181
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,200
Why did Mister think I'd like you?

182
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,994
When I'm with him,
we finish each other's sentences.

183
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,621
Meanwhile, you are always--

184
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,082
Interrupting, just to say
the exact thing that you were going to?

185
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,084
-Yes! It's so--
-Annoying?

186
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,794
Thank you. That's the word.

187
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,089
Hey, I don't wanna be here either.
You know Joey Pogo wants to bounce.

188
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:12,134
What if we just tell Mister
we've formed an emotional bond,

189
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,594
then we can have sex,

190
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,180
and we'll never have
to see each other again!

191
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,893
-Why don't we just tell him we had sex?
-I can't lie to my fiancé about sex!

192
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,230
That's what got us into this mess
in the first place!

193
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,568
[scoffs]

194
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,778
So, as soon as they go to bed
with each other,

195
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,823
we can put this whole thing to bed,
but the problem is...

196
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,616
-She loves him.
-No, the opposite.

197
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,079
No, the opposite of the opposite.
The very thing itself: she loves him.

198
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,163
Why do you say that?

199
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,792
You've got irises, haven't you?
And pupils and corneas?

200
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,461
You might even say you've got
a pair of eyes. Optic nerve?

201
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,462
Yes.

202
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,674
So how could you not see the way that
she follows him across the restaurant

203
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,218
like the puppy dog she is?
How they bicker and flirt?

204
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,888
Why would she fall
for a dashing cad like Joey Pogo

205
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,475
when she's already engaged to sweet,
dependable, predictable, safe, boring,

206
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,644
perfectly adequate Mr. Peanutbutter?

207
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,562
Thank you.

208
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,981
She only tolerates that other fellow
because she has to, for work.

209
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,275
Otherwise she finds him
utterly distasteful.

210
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,445
Piggish even! No offense to me.
None taken, of course. [snorts]

211
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,447
No, she loves him,

212
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,074
though she'd never admit it,
even to herself.

213
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,951
[gasps] And what about the boy?

214
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,911
Sure, he puts up a front
and picks a good fight,

215
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,706
but to just once hear
those stupid words "I love you"

216
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,207
tumble out of her foolish mouth

217
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,917
would drop his heart down
an elevator shaft

218
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,128
and bounce it back up to his throat.

219
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,839
-Yes?
-Yes.

220
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,967
-I'm pretty sure they hate each other.
-Uh...

221
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,262
I... Well, that's all very...
[breathing rapidly]

222
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,556
-Back to BoJack!
-And Sarah Lynn.

223
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,975
Would you say
BoJack's relationship with her

224
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,311
ever bordered on inappropriate

225
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,896
in the weeks leading up to her death?

226
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,107
No! They were closer than thieves!
They were thieves, actually.

227
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,400
They broke into my house together,

228
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,527
like great friends do,
and stole our clothes.

229
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,447
Ask Diane, she never got that jacket back!

230
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,908
But she was able to find another one
shortly thereafter

231
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,284
that looked exactly the same.

232
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,703
-Pardon me.
-Hello. Joseph?

233
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,830
Can I get an announcement drumroll,
please?

234
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,667
[beatboxing]

235
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,584
Never mind.

236
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,462
Joey and I have developed feelings
for each other.

237
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,380
Oh!

238
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,423
[sputtering]

239
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,426
Wow, I didn't think so soon, but--
No, that's wonderful.

240
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,803
It's exactly what we wanted.

241
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,138
It is! So now we make love,

242
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,058
after which we can all get on
with our lives.

243
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,770
Great! This is good.

244
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,359
Look, we're not gonna
figure this out tonight.

245
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,986
Maybe I should just go
to the cast party and try to enjoy--

246
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,072
-[Diane and Carolyn gasp]
-[phone buzzing]

247
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,409
-[phone beeps]
-Hello?

248
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,620
Yes. Um, speaking.

249
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,416
Oh, hello, Paige Sinclair,
of the "Hollywoo Reporter."

250
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,500
[BoJack and Carolyn gasp]

251
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,711
Yes, I know BoJack Horseman.

252
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,798
Uh... What night? Did I see BoJack with...

253
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,133
Uh...

254
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:02,263
Listen, I'd love to talk more,
but, uh, I cut my finger earlier

255
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,516
in a bagel guillotine and I think
I require medical attention, goodbye.

256
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,934
-Bagellotine.
-[phone beeps]

257
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,687
It's Sarah Lynn.

258
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,606
Their story is about you and Sarah Lynn.

259
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,567
[exhales sharply]

260
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,404
[Pickles sighs]

261
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,282
Well, uh, that was...

262
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,951
-Wow.
-Yeah.

263
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,203
Well, see ya later.

264
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,788
[shuddering]

265
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,832
Oh.

266
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,127
Hey, I'm sorry I was kind of a dick
to you earlier.

267
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,879
The truth is, since Mr. Peanutbutter

268
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,464
has been such a good friend
and chill hang,

269
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,883
I was nervous
I would feel weird smashing his fiancée,

270
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,386
but once we were in it,
it was like we were two naked hearts

271
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,308
raw and exposed but safe in the home
we found in each other.

272
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,227
Yeah. Did you just come up with that?

273
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,896
No, it's from my new song,

274
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,899
"Two Naked Hearts (Raw Dog Remix)."

275
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:59,069
-Oh. Sounds like another banger.
-Best of luck with your wedding.

276
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,738
One day I hope to have what you two have.

277
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,907
Right now, I couldn't even imagine
getting married.

278
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,784
I can't even commit
to a social media director.

279
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,701
Why not?

280
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,621
I'm just having a hard time finding
someone who gets my brand, you know?

281
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,164
Sexy?

282
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,209
That's exactly right, you totally get me.

283
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,337
So, if you think of anybody who could be
good for the job, let me know, all right?

284
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,922
-I will.
-All right.

285
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,131
I'm headed to the airport now

286
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,676
for another in a series of extravagant
world tours all by myself.

287
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,345
At least I'll have
the empty seat next to me

288
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,305
that I always book for extra comfort.

289
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,723
I'll be at gate six.

290
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,434
I'm just saying this information out loud
so I don't forget it.

291
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,313
Gate six. Plane boards at 10:38.

292
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,981
-Wait, Joey!
-Yeah?

293
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,859
Um, here's your jacket back. [chuckles]

294
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,820
Thanks, Pickles.

295
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,407
Goodbye, Joey Pogo.

296
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,035
So Sarah Lynn. That's okay.

297
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,620
-We can spin this.
-Yeah?

298
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,621
What are we spinning?

299
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,625
You went on a bender with her,
at some point you split up and she died.

300
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,919
That's the story, right?

301
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,215
If you want us to help you,
you need to tell us what's coming.

302
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,758
You know what I thought?

303
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,553
The first thing I thought
when I heard Sarah Lynn died?

304
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,013
Poor BoJack,
that he had to find her like that.

305
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,392
That's right.
Poor BoJack, that's the angle!

306
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,643
But then I kept thinking.

307
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,980
I wish I didn't,
but my stupid brain kept thinking.

308
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,815
She died of a heroin overdose, yeah?

309
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,902
And you had heroin, "BoJack" brand,
you kept it in your glove compartment.

310
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,487
-Diane...
-I didn't wanna think about it,

311
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,740
but I couldn't help but wonder.
Did you give it to her?

312
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,784
I... Uh...

313
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,286
-Yes.
-And then what?

314
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,912
-You just abandoned her?
-No, I--

315
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,790
You just left her alone,
an addict, with heroin?

316
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,542
I didn't leave her, I was with her!

317
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,004
I was with her the whole time!
I was with her when she died!

318
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,049
-Like "with her" with her?
-In the planetarium.

319
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,303
I left and came back
and pretended I'd found her that way.

320
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,889
I... I've never told anyone that.

321
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,557
That's really bad, BoJack.

322
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,017
Do the reporters know that?

323
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,853
I don't know how they could.
I covered my tracks.

324
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,105
How did you "cover your tracks"?

325
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,565
-[knocking on door]
-[gasps]

326
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,778
Oh. Hey. Uh, what's up?

327
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,239
[Helena] We're doing
end-of-year superlatives,

328
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,201
and we thought it would be cool
if you came out and read some.

329
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,578
Oh, um...

330
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,039
Just, uh, give me a minute.

331
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,041
[muffled chatter]

332
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:21,211
-This was supposed to be a celebration.
-We can still figure this out.

333
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,380
I'm tired of trying to figure things out.

334
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,050
-Let me just have this one night.
-[sighs]

335
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,886
-[Helena] It's Horse Professor!
-[students laughing, cheering]

336
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,138
Okay, okay, settle down, settle down.

337
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,433
Okay. You wanted me
to read these, right? Okay.

338
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,687
-Um, well, for Best Old Man... Terry.
-[students cheering]

339
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,774
-[Terry] Thank you. Thank you so much.
-Okay. Sit down, Terry. Just sit down.

340
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,069
Sit down. If you start talking,
then we'll all be old! [chuckles]

341
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:49,239
For Best Director...
Oh, Horse Professor. [chuckles]

342
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,616
-That's me.
-[cheering]

343
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,910
-[Joshua] Speech!
-No, I-- Okay, okay, okay!

344
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,787
Okay. Thank you.

345
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,166
I just want to say that I've loved
being here with you this year.

346
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:03,003
You've shown me the type of person
I didn't know I wanted to be.

347
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,715
And this semester,
I got to be that person.

348
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,467
Thank you.

349
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:13,180
And I just... I want you all
to appreciate this time,

350
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,934
and how special it is,
and how fast it'll all go away.

351
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,813
Please, cherish this.

352
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,441
And I have my own superlative
to announce.

353
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,277
I, um... [clears throat]

354
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,405
Oh. Uh, hmm...

355
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,658
For the Best Actor or Actress...

356
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,869
Oh, my God, it's an eight-way tie!

357
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,454
-[students cheering]
-[laughs]

358
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,373
Okay, everyone. Enjoy your party.

359
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,166
[chuckles]

360
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,135
Hi, I just gotta tell you
how much I'm loving

361
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,845
the small plates and lazy Susans.

362
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,889
I put my fork down and I never know
what I'm gonna pull back up!

363
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,100
-You've really made dinner fun again.
-Uh-huh.

364
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,936
And did you notice my picture
on the front of the menu?

365
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,564
Uh, sure. I mean that part
I could take or leave,

366
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,817
but the small plates and lazy Susans
work together perfectly

367
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,070
to form a completely new kind
of upscale dining experience.

368
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,822
Exactly like dim sum,

369
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,907
but with white people food,
so it's more accessible.

370
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,953
-Oh, well, thank you.
-Huh! Tragic, isn't it?

371
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,871
What is?

372
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,040
I just keep thinking
about Pickles and Pogo.

373
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,459
They've finally acknowledged
that they love each other,

374
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,254
-but she's promised to another.
-Yes. To me.

375
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,965
Oh, right!
So, you know better than anyone.

376
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,884
Someone's up to something,
I can tell you that much.

377
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,928
Mr. Peanutbutter, does your ex-wife
regularly consume bagels?

378
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,723
Hey, why don't you two mind
your own business? How about that?

379
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,601
As payrolled journalists,
our business is minding your business.

380
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,228
I'm not going to help you
with your take-down piece on BoJack.

381
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,022
-Oh, no?
-He's a good guy.

382
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,691
And you have no idea
how torn up he was with Sarah Lynn.

383
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,111
In fact, he was with her
in the planetarium when she overdosed.

384
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,781
-He actually gave her the heroin!
-Oh?

385
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,741
Yeah. He told me that once
when he was drunk,

386
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,243
and then he said,
"I've never told anybody that."

387
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,872
Because he's modest.
So why don't you just leave him alone?

388
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,790
[huffs]

389
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,293
Oh, Max, it's all coming together!

390
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,046
I could just about kiss someone
if I had someone here to kiss!

391
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,757
-Listen, I've been meaning to discuss--
-The story?

392
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,926
It's cooking now. Smell that sizzle?

393
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,720
We've gotta build on it.
More angles, more leads, more...

394
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,263
-Whoa!
-[grunts]

395
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,933
-Oh...
-My...

396
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,145
I-- You know, I think our story
is about as wrapped up as a mummy.

397
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,105
What?

398
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,357
I'd better hightail it to the office
and put ink on paper.

399
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,776
But what about establishing
a larger pattern of behavior?

400
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,570
We still haven't heard back
from the New Mexico girl

401
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,156
or our contact
at the rehabilitation clinic.

402
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,784
Don't you think we ought
to keep working together?

403
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,912
No, I think I ought to get married.
You were right all along, Banks, my boy.

404
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,164
The story is Sarah Lynn. It always was.

405
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,499
-Taxi!
-[horn honks]

406
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,670
Wait! Paige! I, uh...

407
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,173
-I love you!
-Oh, Max. Of course you do.

408
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,135
Everybody does. I'm Paige Sinclair!

409
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,637
[tires screeching]

410
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,104
So, what happens?
When the story comes out, what do I do?

411
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:11,441
A statement about how sorry you are
about certain parts of the story

412
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,902
but other parts of the story
just aren't true.

413
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,862
No, you--

414
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,532
Then in everyone's head
you've apologized for the really bad stuff

415
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,160
without legally implicating yourself.

416
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,744
-Does that work?
-All the time.

417
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,372
No, it doesn't.
Why are you telling him to lie?

418
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:29,293
Because this is good.
This BoJack here is good.

419
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,754
This is working, but it's so precarious.

420
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,590
Well, I'm not gonna lose
my job here, right?

421
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,301
The Sarah Lynn stuff,
that has nothing to do with this.

422
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,218
-Right.
-No.

423
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,221
You're about to get pushed out of a plane,
and the two of you are talking

424
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,224
like you're trying to brainstorm ways
to get back on the plane.

425
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,559
That's not gonna happen.

426
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,896
You can try to find a parachute
or you can dive headfirst into the earth,

427
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,898
but the plane is gone.

428
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,193
You're seeing things in absolutes.
We can wriggle out of this.

429
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,445
-Who's "we"?
-Diane, I'm asking you for help.

430
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,113
This job is my lifeline.

431
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,117
I think you should do the hard thing
and be honest.

432
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,828
About everything. Things will get worse
before they get better,

433
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,790
but you won't spend the rest of your life
waiting for the other shoe to drop.

434
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,375
Yeah.

435
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,045
-BoJack, just think--

<i>-Thank you for your time.</i>
-[line disconnects]

455
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,634
What happened to being honest?

456
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,428
I didn't think it would happen so fast.
Did she say next Thursday?

457
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,223
That gives us a week to plan.
We can minimize damage.

458
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,141
"We" are not doing anything.

459
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,560
-Diane, please.
-I can't be a part of this.

460
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,354
I have a book to write.

461
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
[grunts] Oh, my God!

462
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,943
They're all making out out here!
Go to your dorms!

463
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,903
You have rooms!

464
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:27,452
Well, we did it.
And by "it," I mean <i>doing it.</i>

465
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,371
Oh-ho! Fantastic.

466
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,375
So, now we're even,
and everything can go back to normal.

467
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,627
I can't wait. First step:
let's set a date for the wedding.

468
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,379
Joey has a job opening on his tour

469
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,590
that I think could be
a real opportunity for me.

470
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,717
Oh.

471
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,014
Only thing is, I'd have to go tonight,
and I might be gone for a while.

472
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,600
-Oh.
-Oh, Mister, I'm so confused!

473
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,313
I feel like my brain is on a lazy Susan,
just spinning in all directions.

474
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,898
And I know I should be ready
to commit to a main course,

475
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,151
but right now I'm just so excited

476
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,862
about all the different small plates
out there, you know?

477
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,906
It sounds like maybe this is a bad time
to have my face printed

478
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,908
on the cover of your metaphorical menu.

479
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,370
What? Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that part of it.

480
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,331
Go on Joey's tour. Have a good time.

481
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,292
And we'll plan the wedding...
when I get back?

482
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,836
Sure, Pickles... when you get back.

483
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,213
-Sounds like a good compromise.
-Yeah?

484
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,965
Yeah. The best.

485
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,510
Everyone gets what they want
and no one had to compromise.

486
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,305
Oh, my God, I gotta go!

487
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,515
-Okay, I love you!
-Hey.

00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,407
What do you got?

493
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,494
"My relationship with Sarah Lynn
was complicated,

494
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,372
as relationships between addicts
often are.

495
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:57,209
However, certain aspects of the story
are inaccurate or exaggerated.

496
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,544
This story has started
an important conversation

497
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,173
and I look forward to continuing to work
on my own progress..."

498
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,676
There's-- There's no way
to not sound like bullshit.

499
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,969
[sighs]

500
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:08,887
Yeah, well...

501
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,348
This place was supposed to be
a fresh start for me.

502
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,475
Rehab was supposed to be a fresh start.

503
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,603
But no matter how many starts I get,
there's always the same ending.

504
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,398
Everything falls apart and I end up alone.

505
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,151
-I'm still here, BoJack.
-Why?

506
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,113
I don't know. I'm a fool, I guess.

507
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,281
And you were my first client,

508
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:32,077
and one time you were drunk
and you smiled at me and I said, "What?"

509
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,706
And you said, "I just like being in a room
with you. You make rooms good."

510
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,624
You still do.

511
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:43,046
I have loved you for 25 years,
and I never loved anyone better.

512
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,508
That kind of love, you only get it
when you're young and stupid.

513
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,926
I'm not gonna get it again.

514
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,388
And when I tell my daughter the story
of the great love of my life,

515
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,849
I want it to have a happy ending.

516
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,768
Is it possible you letting me go
is the happy ending?

517
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,272
I've gone with you this far.
In for a penny, in for a pound, right?

518
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,731
Sunk cost and all that?

519
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,651
Yeah, sunk cost.

520
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,902
[sighs]

521
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,698
The story's coming out Thursday.

522
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:14,286
I don't think that we can get around this,
or over this, or try to get under it.

523
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,746
-Diane is right. We need to go through it.
-BoJack--

524
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,665
I need to take responsibility.

525
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:19,875
I want to.

526
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,669
So you can tell your daughter
you helped me do the right thing.

527
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,674
-I'll call you tomorrow with a plan.
-I'm looking forward to it.

528
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,720
-You sure?
-I mean, no.

529
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:32,929
[laughs]

530
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,395
