you can keep writing

yourself too much.

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,023
-We did it, didn't we?
-We did!

166
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,735
You and me, working together,
both contributing the same amount.

167
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,071
Well, I wrote the article
that got Woodchuck elected governor.

168
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,616
You're the one that made him
not governor in the first place.

169
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,410
I set 'em up. You knock 'em down.

170
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,497
Thank you for meeting me here.

171
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,625
My name is Yolanda Buenaventura
of the Better Business Bureau.

172
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,128
It would be funnier
if your name was Betty Buenaventura

173
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,463
of the Better Business Bureau.

174
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:28,007
Well, I'm sorry you don't find
my name sufficiently comical,

175
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,176
but this is actually
a very serious matter.

176
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,719
-Oh.
-We've received complaints

177
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,137
from several concerned parents.

178
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,431
It seems that many
of your clown dentists

179
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,808
aren't actually licensed
to practice medicine.

180
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,311
Isn't laughter the <i>best</i> medicine?

181
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,104
No. It is the worst medicine.

182
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,815
If you can even call it medicine,
which, legally, you cannot.

183
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,736
Well, what if I said my business
was for entertainment purposes?

184
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,280
That would require your employees
to be entertaining.

185
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,534
According to your reviews on Yelp,
your clown dentists are, quote,

186
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:58,412
"A cotton candy nightmare of Freudian
invention that shakes one to the core."

187
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,248
Ah, everyone's a critic.

188
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,333
On Yelp? Yes, that is the idea.

189
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,378
It appears your business provides
no service but to terrify children

190
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,879
and the adults who accompany them.

191
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,257
If this were October,
you could market your venture

192
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,259
as some sort of spooky
Halloween experience,

193
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,178
but since this is January,
a month which, to my knowledge,

194
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,764
contains no Halloweens,
I have no choice but to--

195
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,057
Wait! Wait.

196
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,351
What if my clown dentists
put on a show?

197
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:26,566
A delightful, whimsical,
non-terrifying clown-stravaganza?

198
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,109
You would have to agree

199
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,194
we were a legitimate
business then, right?

200
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,239
-Go on.
-Give us a week. We'll put on a show.

201
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,658
If you don't laugh,
I'll dissolve the business

202
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,661
and release all my clown dentists
into the woods,

203
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,038
where they'll never bother anyone again.

204
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,081
All right.

205
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,750
You have one week to create a show
that delights and astonishes me.

206
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,961
But I should warn you,
I am a very tough crowd.

207
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,089
I once met Paul Rudd at a cocktail party
and I did not find him charming.

208
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,970
-[bell ringing]
-Ooh!

209
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,306
-Excuse me.
-[overlapping chatter]

210
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,434
-Get outta my way.
-Like, hooked in a funny way.

211
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,895
You call that funny?
That's not funny. It's sad.

212
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,064
Well, some would argue
that sad and funny

213
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,192
-are two sides of the same coin.
-[cries out]

214
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,195
Uh, no! Abraham Lincoln
and some weird flat house

215
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,780
are two sides of the same coin.

216
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,824
-Take five, Picarello.
-[bell ringing]

217
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,036
[groans] I've got a week
to whip these dentists into clowns.

218
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,162
-[crashing]
-[moaning]

219
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,164
But they're just not silly or wacky

220
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,833
or prone to kooky hijinks of any kind!

221
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,877
[sad quack]

222
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,087
-[gulping]
-[groans] Should you be drinking that?

223
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:35,217
Why not? I got no baby or boyfriend.
Might as well get blotto, right? [hiccups]

224
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,347
-Um, shouldn't you be at work?
-I'm recal-bibrating.

225
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,598
-[horn honks]
-Oh!

226
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,683
-[horn honking]
-Ohh...

227
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,268
Hey, maybe you should--

228
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:48,189
-[phone buzzing]
-Judah, look at my phone! Judah!

229
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,359
-You have a meeting with Flip McVicker.
-[groans]

230
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,402
Tell his gal I'm running ten minutes late.

231
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,072
What gal?

232
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,411
-So, you're a writer?
-Oh, actually that's a typo.

233
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,788
It should say "Waiter."

234
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,248
-But I'm an aspiring writer.
-Uh-huh.

235
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,667
Sorry, that was a joke.

236
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,919
That's the kind of witty repartee
you can expect from--

237
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,712
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the business card.

238
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:12,922
Wait, ya know,

239
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,383
-I have this idea for a TV show.
-Oh?

240
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,386
It's a grizzled former detective
who gets sucked back in--

241
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,637
This sounds fabulous.

242
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,680
Why don't you write a script,
we'll go from there?

243
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,809
-I already wrote it. Boom.
-Oh, you brought it with you.

244
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,812
I don't trust email.
You know, the government.

245
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,022
Yeah. Look, Flip, before I even read this,

246
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,067
I should tell you
that this town's a total crapshoot.

247
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,944
Odds of the right person
finding your material

248
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:39,198
and connecting with it
are a million to... one.

249
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:43,744
I just know I have this great potential
inside me. I know I can do it.

250
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,956
Even if no one else understands
or believes in me.

251
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,791
I'm sure that sounds pretty stupid but...

252
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,919
It's not stupid. I believe in you.

253
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,881
I don't know how else to describe it

254
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,301
other than this feeling
of supreme warmth came over me,

255
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,554
like this is what I've been waiting for
my whole life.

256
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,847
That's amazing!

257
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,434
Todd, the world is dark and scary
and full of creepy clown dentists...

258
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,602
They're working very hard
to be less creepy.

259
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,397
But when I hold this script in my hands,
I have hope.

260
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,066
I gotta get this made.
What do I always say?

261
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,318
"What's the difference
between an agent and a manager?"

262
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,029
Uh, managers are always
talking about the differences

263
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,199
between agents and managers
and agents don't as much?

264
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,953
No! Managers can produce!
This script is a sign.

265
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,247
I gotta get off my ass
and produce this baby.

266
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,457
Todd? [hiccups]

267
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,251
Get me a meeting with Turtletaub.
Set something up with his gal.

268
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,836
Who is this gal?

269
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,089
[snoring]

270
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,092
Okay. Clentists, assemble!

271
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,552
[clowns clamoring]

272
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,263
Wipe those serious looks
off your faces and listen up!

273
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,806
We gotta help Princess Carolyn,

274
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,517
but also we gotta prep
for our big show next week.

275
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,395
If only there was a way
to do both at once.

276
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,522
What a ludicrous notion!

277
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,193
Doctor Picarello,
we might make a clown out of you yet!

278
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,278
Oh, joy!

279
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,697
[cackling]

280
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,324
Special delivery.

281
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:08,954
This next part is critical. Remain wacky.
This is a highly frivolous situation!

282
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,752
-What's in the package?
-It's a hand delivery item.

283
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:15,878
Hey!

284
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,882
-Now, Doctor Boing Boing!
-I am in position.

285
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,595
[straining]

286
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,847
All right, Princess Carolyn, sit tight.

287
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,266
-[grunts]
-Whoa!

288
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,395
...before, so it's really the avocado 
thing that I have a problem with.

289
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,564
[grunts]

290
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,860
Target is acquired.

291
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,530
[mimics static] Deliver the goods,
Doctor Boing Boing!

292
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,157
Ah!

293
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,952
It's sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-showtime!

294
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,870
-Whoa!
-Oh!

295
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,665
-Princess Carolyn!
-Lenny, thanks for making time.

296
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,208
Didn't realize I had.

297
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,793
[sniffing] Are you drunk?

298
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,920
You smell like somebody
tried to put out a fire

299
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,588
at the booze factory with more booze.

300
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,216
Uh, new perfume, "Sealist," by Seal.

301
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,969
Now let's get to brass stacks.

302
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,973
So it's a hot young writer.
It's TV. It's me producing.

303
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,808
-"TV?"
-Just look at this script.

304
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,060
I know it's gonna knock your socks off.

305
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,728
Eh...

306
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,982
Know that website,
"What-time-is-it-right-now-dot-com,"

307
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,984
you go to when you want
to know what time it is?

308
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:20,985
Yeah.

309
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,654
They look to make a play
in the gritty prestige streaming world,

310
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,073
and it could make a big splash
with a huge ad buy.

311
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,868
Plus, you got the built-in audience
who don't know what time it is.

312
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,078
That's huge! That's so many people!

313
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,414
Yeah, yeah, this could be perfect
as their first series,

314
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,790
but we'd have to get in fast.

315
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,625
They wanna premiere
before Daylight Savings.

316
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,419
Let's set the pitch for next week.

317
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,254
<i>Philbert?</i> Who's Philbert?

318
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,882
He's this grizzled
but very good-looking detective

319
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,134
who gets sucked back in to something.

320
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,302
No, I mean who <i>is </i>he?

321
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,178
-You got a star attached?
-Not yet, but...

322
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,972
Eh, we can't go in without a big name.

323
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,809
TV pitching is like the Israeli flag,
it's nothing without a big star.

324
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,102
Sorry, Princess Carolyn.

325
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,478
No! Fish!

326
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,899
Oh, whoa... ooh, spinny.

327
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,903
Uh-oh! She is out like sauerkraut.

328
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,197
[mimics static] Don't let Turtletaub
get back to his office.

329
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:11,035
This sounds like a job
for the "Waltz of the Rubber Chicken"!

330
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,579
[Todd] <i>Doctor Picarello,</i>

Hey! Hey! Pardon me. Excuse me!

335
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,213
-Oh! Allow me to lead, my lady.
-Wow.

336
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,800
-What the shell is this?
-So beautiful.

337
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,887
It says so much
without saying anything at all.

338
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,722
You gotta be kidding me.

339
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,432
Okay, okay, how about Aaron Eckhart?

340
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,684
He owes me a favor
and he can disappear into any role.

341
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,646
Yeah, he can disappear so good,
the audience disappears with him.

342
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,189
-Tony Shalhoub!
-Tony Sha-who-ub?

This project is my ba...
[hiccups] my ba...

348
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,830
-It's my baby.
-Well, if you can't attach a real star,

349
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,290
-your baby's dead.
-No!

350
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,750
Oh, thank you.

351
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,294
There's gotta be a name
that does something for you.

352
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,965
Uh, Jack Huston... Hugh... Hugh Jackman.

353
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,549
-BoJack Horseman!
-There's someone...

354
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,801
-Corbin Bernsen.
-No.

355
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,844
-Ben Mendelsohn.
-No, no, no. Hold on.

356
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,807
-BoJack. That's an idea.
-Yeah, yeah, sure. A BoJack-type.

357
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,017
[sighs] I swore I'd never work
with that asshole again,

358
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,686
but you gotta admit he's got heat.

359
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,271
Star of <i>Secretariat,</i>
<span style="style_3"/>disappears for a year,

360
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,150
shows up again to do one episode
of a reality show about butts.

361
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,151
Right, but--

362
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,154
And then you get him playing
a rich, complex anti-hero like Philbert,

363
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,992
now there's a show that screams,
"What time is it right now?"

364
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,284
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

365
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,953
I'm saying, there are a lotta guys...

366
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,913
P.C., can you get me BoJack or not?

367
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,125
-Of course I can.
-I'll send over a contract, iron-clad.

368
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,502
I don't want to risk that jerkwad
skipping town again.

369
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,630
-Make sure he signs it before the pitch.
-Uh, will do.

370
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,926
And, uh, go easy on the sauce, huh, kid?
Sloppy don't suit you.

Ah, I got that damn thing

373
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,100
Guys, that was amazing!

374
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,353
But if we're going to convince Yolanda
we're ready for the big top,

375
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,731
we need to really hunker down
over the next week

376
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,151
and put together a show
so undeniably hilarious

377
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:11,530
and life-affirming,
that she has no choice but to say...

378
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:17,494
Wow! What a great show!
Okay, you can keep your business...

379
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,787
-Hooray!
-Perfect!

380
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,457
...is what I <i>would</i> say
if you'd put on a good show.

381
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,460
Just so you understand the rubric
when I declare my actual reaction,

382
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,045
which is: "I did not enjoy that."

383
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,673
-[clamoring]
-Oh, no! My hooray was premature!

384
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,677
So I must recommend that
you dissolve this venture immediately.

385
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,972
All right, you heard the lady.
Get into the car, everyone.

386
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,976
I'm taking you to the woods,
out by the old abandoned insane asylum,

387
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,604
near the elementary school
where you belong.

388
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,772

389
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,732
[snoring]

390
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,650
Hey, so I'm taking
the rest of the day off.

391
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,902
What? Why?

392
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,612
Just don't feel like working right now,

393
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,532
so I think if I force it,
I'm just gonna do a bad job.

394
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,658
Thank you, Stuart.

395
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,161
But I did want to remind you
about that bitch meeting you have

396
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,414
-this afternoon at that clock website.
-You mean the pitch meeting.

397
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,334
Pretty sure it said "bitch" meeting
on the calendar.

398
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,795
Seemed a little harsh.
I could go double-check,

399
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,923
but the calendar's
all the way downstairs so...

400
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,675
-No, Stuart. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

401
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,721

00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,141

<i>-</i>Hey, BoJack, great news!

404
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,896
-Bad time. Can't talk.

00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,147
-[dial tone]
-[sighs]

406
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,610
Okay.

407
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,364
Here we go, baby.

408
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,246
Oh, man!
You are not finding what you need!

409
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,624
The deck is a harsh mistress, Tina.
Hollyhock, you gotta get in here!

410
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,669
Tina is drawing so many cards.
It's amazing.

411
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,088
Hollyhock! Hollyhock?

412
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,215
-[body thuds in distance]
-Hollyhock?

413
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,424
[woman] That's her name?

414
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,593
Yes, for the third time,
her name is "Hollyhock."

415
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,719
And her last name?

416
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,098
Manheim-Mannheim, uh, Steamroller...

417
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,349
Is there more?

418
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,643
I think there's a Lopez
in the mix somewhere?

419
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,978
A Chung maybe?

420
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,021
I'm sorry, sir, I can't help you.

421
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,566
Okay, just... any information
you can give me

422
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,943
on the 17-year-old horse girl
who came here by ambulance

423
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,112
15 minutes ago would be
of interest to my friend,

424
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,781
Mr. Franklin's... friend, Mr. Hamilton.

425
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,284
If you can't prove you're
her parent or legal guardian,

426
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,077
I can't release any information to you.

427
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,203
-Guerrero!
-What?

428
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,081
Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero...
Robinson...

429
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,168
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzarelli-McQuack.
That's her name.

430
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,294
And she's about five-eight.

431
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,129
And she's 17,
her birthday is in September.

432
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,173
And... she looks like me.

433
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,133
And she loves apples
but hates apple sauce.

434
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,259
And she's funny.

435
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,388
But she isn't mean.
Which is pretty remarkable,

436
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,141
'cause a lot of 17-year-olds think
you have to be mean to be funny,

437
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,894
but Hollyhock is very sweet,

438
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,270
even if she can be sarcastic.

439
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,024
But she has this smile with...

440
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,192
Does that help?

441
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,485
No, man.
Are you her legal guardian?

442
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,571
I'm not leaving here
until I get to see her.

443
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,364
-Have a seat.
-[groans]

444

00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,337
-[man] She'll be fine.
-Huh?

449
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,088
We have to think
what's best for Hollyhock.

450
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,216
-Hollyhock is going to be okay.
-Excuse me.

451
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,842
Did you say Hollyhock? Are you...

452
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,135
Jose Guerrero.

453
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,930
Hello, yes! Yeah. Thank God you're here.
I'm BoJack Horseman.

454
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,224
Yeah, we know.
I'm her dad, Steve Mannheim.

455
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,808
I'm the wrong Mannheim to mess with.

456
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,935
I'm Dashawn Manheim.

457
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,811
I'm probably
the right Manheim to mess with,

458
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,814
unless we're talking about
a dance battle, in which case...

459
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,859
Five, six, seven, eight. Ha!

460
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,320
-You've been warned.
-Okay. Yep.

461
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,365
Cupe Robinson III.
I think you're just ghastly,

462
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,909
and I was against
this whole caper from the bell.

463
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,535
-Okay.
-Otto Zilberschlag.

464
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,621
Uh, formerly a huge fan.

465
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,623
-Now... just a regular fan.
-Got it.

466
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,875
I know <i>of</i> you,
but not through your work.

467
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,418
-Okay.
-I'm Gregory Hsung.

468
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,213
I only watch foreign films.
That's my deal.

469
00:20:56,296 --> 00:21:02,219
Arturo Fonzarelli, but I'm pretty cool
so people call me the "Ice Man."

470
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,887
And I'm Quackers!

471
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,764
-Quack, quack, quack!
-Easy, Quackers.

472
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,849
How's Hollyhock?
They wouldn't give me information.

473
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,978
-Why would they? You're not her dad.
-No, I know. I just... Is she okay?

474
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,438
She will be.
The doctor said she's lucky to be alive.

475
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,606
What happened?

476
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,358
-She overdosed.
-What? No.

477
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,902
How could you let this happen?
Quack, quack!

478
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,072
-Quackers! Settle down.
-What was she on? I had no idea.

479
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,240
You had no idea?

480
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,409
Have you looked at her?
She's as thin as a pole.

481
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,203
You know I don't care
for your Polish jokes, Dashawn.

482
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,330
She told us you were
taking care of her.

483
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,165
-I was.
-I knew she was too young

484
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,542
to be on her own like this.

485
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,710
She's a child!

486
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,338
She called Pedro Almod√≥var's
<i>I'm So Excited</i> "excessively kitsch."

487
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,718
-Kitsch <i>is</i> excessive! That's the point!
-Can I see her? Can I talk to her?

488
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,970
-You're lucky we don't call the police!
-Quack, quack.

489
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,889
Our kid got hooked on amphetamines
because of you!

490
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,766
-No, I didn't...
-Quack, quack, quack, quack.

491
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,728
Okay, I feel like there's a lot

Why don't I come back in a couple hours?

493
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,898
Give Hollyhock a chance to rest
before I talk to her.

494
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,360
Are you insane?
You are never seeing Hollyhock again.

495
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,737
-Look, if I could just...
-Never.

-[panting] Okay.

499
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,375
Henrietta, would you like a grapefruit?

500
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,794
I have but four,
but I will share one with you,

501
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,629
for I am kind and honest.

502
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,090
[normal audio] No, no. No, no, no.

503
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,428

00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,859
-Where's the girl?
-She's gone, Mom.

507
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,612
Oh, yes, I took her, didn't I?
Where did I put her?

508
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,364
Oh, Henrietta,
would you help me pack this?

509
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,784
-I want to bring it to my son.
-Thanks, Mom.

510
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:53,622
-It's for my son.
-Right. How did I not see it?

511
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,333
All this time, I thought
you were a terrible parent.

512
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,377
And you were.
But I blew it even worse.

513
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:04,132
It turns out being a parent is impossible,
so I guess I can't be that mad at you.

514
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:08,220
Mad at me? No, Henrietta,
this is the right thing. You'll see.

515
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,763
Maybe we deserve each other.

516
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,349
Where is the girl?
I made the girl coffee.

517
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,559
Jesus, you two and your coffee.

518
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,937
Wait. No.

519
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,605
-[panting]
-Oh!

520
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,023
What did you put in this?

521
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,442
That's an old family secret.

522
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,574
"Chub-B-Gone?"

523
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,327
-Takes the pounds right off.
-This whole time.

524
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,538
Just until she learned to take it herself.

525
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,331
-Of course it was you.
-Henrietta!

526
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,208
No. All this "I-don't-know-where-I-am

527
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,711
or-who-my-son-stuff" is,
is officially not cute anymore.

528
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,547
You ruined the one good thing I had.

529
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,050
The one thing I didn't ruin myself,
but of course I did

530
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,011
because I thought it was a good idea
to give you one more chance.

531
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,307
-Where is Crackerjack?
-Stop. You are out of chances.

541
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,411
No, I said "worst available room."

542
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,249
FYI, we keep these blinds down

543
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,126
because the window looks out
at a Dumpster.

544
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,711
-Noted.
-You know...

I can make sure your mother
is very well taken care of.

Oh! In that case, please watch me
not reach for my wallet.

00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:37,017
Well, this is your life now.
This is what it all added up to.
