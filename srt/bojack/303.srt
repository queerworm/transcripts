00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,539
Eh...

163
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,251
- Cuff 'em, boys, or, uh, girls.
- I am a woman, sir.

164
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,170
Lindsay, you know I am trying.

165
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,006
Can we please show a united front
in front of the perps?

166
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,467
- We will talk about this later.
- Aww.

167
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,263
Ohh! It smells like a skunk
skunked another skunk in here,

168
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,307
then they smoked a joint.
What happened?

169
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,019
First I rolled all over the couch
to get the skunk stench out,

170
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,312
but that did not work.

171
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:45,441
Then I ran into every room to rub myself
on all my clothes and belongings,

172
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,568
to get the Mr. Peanutbutter smell back.

173
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,237
And then I smoked a joint,

174
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,822
so that might be
why it smells like skunk in here.

175
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,992
Princess Carolyn, I have to fix this
before Diane gets home.

176
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,619
Things have been shaky with us

177
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,913
since she pretended
to be out of the country for two months.

178
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,831
And then when I filled our entire house

179
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,417
with these giant crates
of spaghetti strainers, that did not help.

180
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,878
Why buy these spaghetti strainers
in the first place?

181
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,257
Oh, I don't even remember.
I'm sure it'll pay off at some point.

182
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,300
Man, married life is weird.

183
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,053
We're making an effort
and getting stronger every day,

184
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,598
but I swear to God we are like five
big fights away from a divorce,

185
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,475
I do not want this to be one.

186
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,270
Okay, number first.
We got to get you in a tomato bath.

187
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,438
Mmm! Delicious and nutritious.

188
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,523
Is marinara all right,

189
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,775
or will I need something zestier
like Arrabiata?

190
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,611
Tomato bath.

191
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,821
Whoa!

192
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,908
I am so high right now. [sniffs]
Wait, was there a skunk in here?

193
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,867
[Princess Carolyn groans]

194
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,666
- What do you know about Nadia?
- Uh, who's Nadia?

195
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,086
Your friend doing the face-down mambo
in the king-sized bathtub.

196
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,715
- Now I know her name is Nadia.
- Oh, so you're a comedian, huh?

197
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,175
Although I am trying to branch
into more serious roles.

198
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,679
You pigs think you can march all over us.
But I know my rights.

199
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,224
- Yeah, what are they?
- I mean, I don't <i>know them</i> know them.

200
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,228
But I know that I have them.
So, can I check my phone real quick?

201
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,188
You're not gonna look up your rights,
are you?

202
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,398
What? No.

203
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,733
I'm just supposed to moderate

204
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,360
an Emily VanCamp live-chat talkback
on Snapchat.

205
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:18,117
Let me just set up
the user preferences here, and...

206
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,453
you can't detain us
unless we're under arrest.

207
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,205
Damn it. You <i>were </i>looking up
your rights, weren't you?

208
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,666
Nope, that was just a thing
I already knew.

209
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,003
Everyone's stupid rights these days.
I never get to have any fun.

210
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,506
- Let's get out of here.
- BoJack, I need to show you something.

211
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,008
This is Nadia's phone.

212
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,428
I did not know you were such a klepto.
I can buy you a new phone.

213
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,639
Check this out,
the last text message she sent.

214
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,599
"BoJack is going to kill me?"

215
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,310
I think someone's trying to frame you,
for murder.

216
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,519
[gasps]

217
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,564
Oh, my God, we're gonna be late
for the Bat Mitzvah.

218
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,940
We got to get to Brentwood.

219
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,402
At this time of day?
It's gonna be... murder.

220
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,447
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey. L'chaim ♪</i>

221
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,699
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey. L'chaim ♪</i>
Hey!

222
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,160
I can't believe
you're not more concerned about this.

223
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,497
- Someone is implicating you in a murder.
- I can be two things at once.

224
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,790
I am very concerned,

225
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,876
but also very proud
that today Tovah is a woman.

226
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,920
Hi, BoJack Horseman,
potential Oscar nominee.

227
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,631
I am kvelling over here. Real verklempt.

228
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,965
<i>Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom.</i>

229
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,675
<i>- Shabbat shalom.</i>
<i>- Shabbat shalom</i> to you.

230
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,388
We need to figure out who's behind this.
Call Jill, find out what she knows.

231
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,472
Good thinking.

232
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,975
If I go to jail, that will throw
a monkey wrench into my awards campaign.

233
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,019
The Academy does not look kindly
on murder.

234
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,854
Rape, they don't seem
to have a problem with.

235
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,690
Be careful. Jill could be the one
trying to set you up.

236
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,192
She did send us to the house.

237
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,570
Backstrom, turn it down a notch.
Aren't you supposed to be tweeting for me?

238
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,448
This is a crucial weekend
for BoJack brand awareness.

239
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,493
What am I supposed to tweet?
"Someone got murdered, we found the body.

240
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,246
- Hashtag murder party"?
- No, obviously.

241
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,791
[grunts] Bat Mitzvah in Brentwood.
Hashtag Jewish stuff.

242
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,001
- [Jill] <i>BoJack.</i>
- Hey, Jill.

243
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,421
You're not trying to frame me
for murder, are you?

244
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,339
<i>- What?</i>
- Can you take this seriously?

245
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,882
Can you take <i>this </i>seriously?

246
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,885
You find the letter? Check in the vent
behind the water feeder.

247
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,513
I've been pretty tied up
at Drake's cousin's Bat Mitzvah.

248
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,682
Did you know Drake's cousin was Jewish?

249
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,852
I'm sorry, did I forget to hang up?
Get the letter.

250
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,354
This is why I couldn't live in New York.
Everyone's so bossy.

251
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,356
Also, what's with the pizza
by the slice thing?

252
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,567
Hey, New York,
either eat a pizza or don't.

253
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,778
I'm calling the last person
Nadia was in contact with before she died.

254
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,071
Maybe she knows something.

255
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,239
- [female]<i> Nadia?</i>
- No, this is--

256
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,742
<i>Where you been? Boys upstairs</i>
<i>are getting real sick of you.</i>

257
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,245
[Goober] <i>Get off the phone,</i>
<i>Skinny Gina. You're on the clock.</i>

258
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,204
[female] <i>I gotta go.</i>

259
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,791
- That man's voice sounded familiar.
- Yeah, super familiar.

260
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,086
Something about that voice
made me want to tell it to go home.

261
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,130
- [gasps] It's Goober.
- [gasps] Goober.

262
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,715
That guy never went home.

263
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,633
Except for that one episode
"Goober Goes Home,"

264
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,635
because we were
on a softball team together

265
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,095
and the home was home plate.

266
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,889
They must be at Whale World.

267
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,309
Okay, good. Because I absolutely
want to get to the bottom of this.

268
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,853
Can we at least wait
until after they lift the chair?

269
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,397
- That is my favorite part.
- Yeah, we gotta lift the chair.

270
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,443
[Todd]
Oh, I taste delicious.

271
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,528
How you boys doing in there?

272
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,114
- Ahh! I feel clean as a whistle.
- Oh, no, the stain.

273
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,700
- Me three.
- [groans]

274
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,327
You took your bath together?

275
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,915
Lena Dunham takes baths with her friends
and no one gives her shit.

276
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:11,957
Gotta-- Gotta get dry.

277
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,752
Mr. Peanutbutter, use the towel.
Do not shake.

278
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,962
- The sauce is so sticky and wet.
- Don't shake.

279
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,381
It's dripping all over my body.
I gotta shake!

280
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,383
- Aaah!
- [Princess Carolyn] Aah!

281
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,927
Oh, yeah.

282
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,053
[shuddering]

283
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,722
Oh, look, that made things worse.

284
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,684
Okay, I'll call a cleaning service.
You two get rid of the stinky clothes.

285
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,438
You got it, chief.
Hooray! Following instructions.

286
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,941
[dance music playing]

287
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,819
Ooh.

288
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,656
Fish half off at Beverly Hills
farmers market.

289
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,616
Hashtag something fishy this way comes.

290
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,786
You're not putting emojis in, are you?
BoJack don't tweet emojis.

291
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:53,374
- BoJack? Oh, my God!
- Oh, hey... you.

292
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,917
I haven't seen you in forever.

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,836
- You came to see your old friend.
- Uh, yeah.

294
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,631
All this time
I thought you forgot about me.

295
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,509
Things haven't been so swell with me
since the show ended.

296
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,595
- Not like you, Mr. Movie Star.
- [chuckles] Okay, buddy.

297
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,389
Just knowing that you care about me

298
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,058
and would come patronize
my place of business,

299
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,227
- it really means a lot.
- You got it, Goober.

300
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,688
Oh, no, I haven't been Goober
for 20 years.

301
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,649
- You can call me by my real name.
- Okay, maybe I will.

302
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,318
Right now, call me by my real name.
I want to hear you.

303
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,528
Uh...

304
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:27,366
I want to say Goo... bert.
Goobert?

305
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,160
Oh, you didn't come to see me, did you?

306
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,080
- No, we did, but--
- I get it. I'm a big joke.

307
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,958
"Let's all go down to Whale World
and laugh at Goober.

308
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,711
We'll have a whale of a good time
at Goober's expense.

309
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,337
He's always good for a laugh."

310
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,798
I should've known better
than to get my hopes up.

311
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,716
Yeah.

312
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,051
We're looking for one of your strippers,
Skinny Gina?

313
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:50,097
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We don't employ strippers here.

314
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,349
Whale World is a family establishment,

315
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,477
where children of all ages
have a fun, sexy time.

316
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,730
Hey, Skinny Gina,
get that sweet tail over here!

317
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,274
You got a customer. You enjoy yourself.

318
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,485
- Well, hello, land mammals.
- [chuckles]

319
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,280
We're just here to ask you some questions
about your friend Nadia.

320
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,907
I'm on the clock. You want to chat?

321
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,492
Buy me a private dance
in the Blowhole Room.

322
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,871
- Oh, please.
- Ugh, gross. Private dance?

323
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,457
But if that's the only way she'll talk,
then fine.

324
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,791
Fine, I'm offended. Yuck.

325
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,461
But really, guys, gross. Start it now.

326
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,921
- But gross.
- [groans]

327
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,844
Oh, um, you can dance however
you want. Don't do this for my benefit.

328
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,182
Tango, waltz, salsa.
I'm just saying, but pretend I'm not here.

329
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,726
- How would you dance then?
- Like a stripper, probably.

330
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:40,397
Listen, we have some bad news.
Your friend Nadia is dead.

331
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,191
- Not surprised.
- You're not?

332
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,736
A lot of girls like her come through here.
Sweet, vulnerable.

333
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,989
This place takes 'em
and makes 'em a lot of promises.

334
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,034
They say they're gonna take care of you,
make you big like Shamu.

335
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,454
But once your body gets too banged up,
they don't want you no more.

336
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:59,750
- Thar she blows, then thar she goes.
- Shit.

337
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,794
Watch your mouth, lady.
There are children here.

338
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,962
- Uh...
- [giggling]

339
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,965
What do you know about Nadia's
relationship with Cuddlywhiskers?

340
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,925
Doesn't ring a bell, never met the guy.

341
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,220
His house has been abandoned
for months, though. That's all I know.

342
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,972
- That's it?
- That's it.

343
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,015
A bunch of girls used to hang out.

344
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,185
He had some sort of system.
Told 'em he was gonna help 'em.

345
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,146
- What do you mean, "system"?
- I have already said too much.

346
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,774
A system is a formulated method
or plan of procedure.

347
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:27,236
- I know what the word "system" means--
- But that's all I can say.

348
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,781
That text that Nadia sent you,
"BoJack is going to kill me."

349
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,032
Any idea what that's about?

350
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,785
Hey, I don't know nothing about BoJack.

351
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,996
How do you not know about BoJack?
I am very famous.

352
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,247
- Time's up.
- [groans]

353
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,164
[sighs]

354
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,876
Hey, if you really want to know
about all that stuff,

355
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,128
come by here real late.

356
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,880
There's an after-hours party.
But that's all I can say.

357
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,799
I'm not gonna spill any more beans.

358
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,344
Say you got BoJack with you.
That'll get you in. Okay, that's it.

359
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,848
Is Wilbur coming today?

360
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,935
Wilbur's not real. He was a character
on a TV show you were on.

361
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,898
- Oh. Are my kids coming today?
- Um...

362
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,358
- No.
- Hey there, fella.

363
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,278
Can't wait for you to see <i>Secretariat,</i>
think you're gonna love it.

364
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,280
Hey, old pal.
Hope you remember how to vote.

365
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,532
We have to go
to this Whale World party.

366
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,951
I know I should go,
I'm invested in figuring out

367
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,453
who's trying to frame me for murder.

368
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,039
Are you sure you wanna go with me?
Outside of work hours?

369
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,915
I wouldn't want to be unprofessional.

370
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,584
Sorry about what I said.

371
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,754
I was embarrassed by the person I was
when I was staying with you.

372
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,380
I'm trying not to be that person.

373
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,758
I make you unhappy?
Is that what you're saying?

374
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,343
It's not about being happy.
That's the thing.

375
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,429
I'm just trying to get through each day.

376
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,848
I can't keep asking myself, "Am I happy?"

377
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,349
It just makes me more miserable.

378
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,977
Can I get a photo with the star?

379
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,397
- Of course.
- Oh, thank you.

380
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,359
I don't know if I believe in it,
real lasting happiness.

381
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:53,280
All those perky, well-adjusted people
you see in movies and TV shows?

382
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,283
- I don't think they exist.
- No one's happy all the time.

383
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,161
- You have to focus on the small things.
- Right.

384
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,413
- Like winning an Oscar.
- Right.

385
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,999
Hey, old pal.
Look at this guy, still alive.

386
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,793
Hope your voting finger works.

387
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,632
- What happened out here?
- You told us to get rid of the clothes.

388
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:15,260
Oh, we got rid of 'em, all right.
They're never coming back.

389
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,678
[cackling]

390
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,640
You two are impossible.
Why did you even call me here?

391
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,850
Because you're Princess Carolyn,
you can fix anything.

392
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,937
That's true.
But you can't start a fire on your lawn.

393
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,689
There's a drought and--
There's a drought.

394
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,485
You, thoughtful husband that you are,
got rid of your lawn,

395
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,696
and replaced it
with drought-resistant landscaping.

396
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,990
This could work.
I got to make a few phone calls.

397
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,742
Aw, thanks. You're the best.

398
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,328
I tell you, I've got half a mind
to go over

399
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,206
and give it to that skunk
for starting this whole darn thing.

400
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,085
No. You go inside to your spot
and stay there while I fix this.

401
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,629
- Yeah, but-- Right, but, um...
- Stay. Stay.

402
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,755
- Stay.
- [whimpers]

403

Ugh.

405
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,262
- I, uh...
- Living the nightlife.

406
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,849
Hashtag feeling good about myself
and my choices.

407
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,480
Aah!

408
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,690
Hey, look.

409
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,070
Let's definitely follow that guy.

410
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,908
- Ladies first.
- What a gentleman.

411
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,411
Ohh.

412
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,208
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,751

BoJack kills?

417
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,801
Something tells me that's not a reference
to your old stand-up act.

418
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,428
Was that necessary?

419
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,598
- What do you want?
- I'm with BoJack.

420
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,099
Yeah? Let me see.

421
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,227

- Let me see some BoJack.

- From the logo.
- Huh?

[gasps] BoJack, you didn't kill Nadia.
BoJack did.

00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,010
Thought you'd go sticking your little nose
where it doesn't belong?

What's the play here?
Trying to get a cut of my smack biz?

What? No, Goober.

[groans]

437
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,312
We just wanted to know why everyone
was talking about how BoJack kills?

438
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,606
Why would you implicate me
in your drug business?

439
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,107
Wait, I get what happened.

440
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,361
You resented me all these years.
My fame, your obscurity.

441
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,238
You made me the face of this drug,

442
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,575
because to you my face is a symbol
for the opiate of show business.

443
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,285
- No, man. You played The Horse.
- Huh?

444
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,120
- Horse is a nickname for heroin.
- What?

445
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,581
- BoJack. Horse. Heroin.
- Uh-huh. Uh...

Oh-- Oh, okay. Yeah, right.

Actually, I've been tracking you
all night.

Lindsay, I said "we".
Do you need credit for everything?

- I would like credit for something.

What do we know?

458
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,698
Nadia was not murdered.
She died of a heroin overdose.

459
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,826
No one tried to frame me.
All right, back in the Oscar race.

460
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,327
Look out, Jurj Clooners.

461
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,496
But something's still fishy
about this whole mess,

462
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,833
- and it's not just the killer whales.
- Whales are mammals, Diane.

463
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,877
- I said it's <i>not</i> the whales.
- You said it's not <i>just</i> the whales.

464
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,130
There's more to this story.
What are we missing?

465
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,425
Cuddlywhiskers. What was Nadia
doing in his backyard in the first place?

466
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,468
What was this "system"?
And where is he now?

467
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,346
Why was it so important to Jill
to get that letter back?

468
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,391
Oh, yeah, the letter.
This mystery has too many things.

469
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,270
I say we go back to the house and
finally get to the bottom of what's what.

470
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,314
Oh, this is turning into a real caper.

471
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,233
A real Jill Pill jail fail
killer whale caper.

472

[Diane] Oh, God, you're right.

473
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,113
I feel so alive.

474
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,617
[groans] This letter is really graphic.

475
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,620
It's all about their magical nights
up at the Ojai property.

476
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,705
Ojai property?

477
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,541
She wrote out the sounds.
What is a "sploink"?

478
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,501
Did you know Cuddlywhiskers
had an Ojai property?

479
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,754
Sure. He always loved
to disappear up there.

480
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,173
After our show got canceled,
he went there for six months.

481
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:25,302
It's funny, at the time no one knew
where he was and we got really worried.

482
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,554
Anyway, wonder where he went this time.

483
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:29,931
Oh, you know what?

484
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,061
- I don't see him. Do you?
- Huh.

485
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,772
- <i>I'm Terry Gross and this your ring tone.</i>
- Shit.

486
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,773
Mr. Peanutbutter.

487
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
- Diane, where the hell are you?
- Ojai.

488
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,487
Oh, hi? You've been gone all night,
all you have to say is "Oh, hi?"

489
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,782
I'm so sorry. BoJack and I
were trying to find a killer and--

490
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,701
Oh, you're with BoJack still?
Well, that explains it. Of course.

491
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,370
Mr. Peanutbutter,
I understand and affirm your feeling--

492
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,331
I'm glad you're safe.
I was worried about you.

493
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,958
- What I'm hearing you say is you were--
- No, stop.

494
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,961
You have to call me.
It doesn't matter what's happening,

495
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,005
doesn't matter
if it's the middle of the night.

496
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,673
You can't keep doing this to me.

497
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,760
I'm sorry. I'm coming home.

498
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,429
I'm going back to bed.
We'll talk about this in the morning.

499
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,972
[groans]

500
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,266
- Everything okay?
- No.

501
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,769
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.

502
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,312
It's my fault.

503
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,191
- [gasps]
- BoJack?

504
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,196
Mmm.

505
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,367
After <i>The BoJack Horseman Show</i>
fell apart, I got depressed a long time.

506
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,328
Sure, I wrote a bunch of hit movies,
I made a ton of money,

507
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,538
but it wasn't fulfilling.

508
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,415
I remember when I won my Oscar,
standing up on that stage,

509
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,917
looking at the statue and thought,

510
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,211
"This is supposed to be
the happiest moment of my life."

511
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,088
And I never felt more miserable.

512
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,591
- Oh. Because you're sober?
- Because an Oscar is meaningless.

513
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,845
It's all meaningless.
I dedicated myself to helping others.

514
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,764
I turned my home into a halfway house
for troubled addicts.

515
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,892
I had this system for recovery,
and it helped a lot of them,

516
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,061
but even more slipped through the cracks.

517
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,063
That, too, left me empty.

518
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,232
Everyone was worried about you,
you know.

519
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,318
You can't just disappear.
You really hurt a lot of people.

520
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,613
Sometimes you need to take responsibility
for your own happiness.

521
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,490
You don't think that's a little selfish?

522
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,952
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm happy, for the first time in my life.

523
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,537
I'm not gonna feel bad about it.

524
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,999
It takes a long time to realize
how truly miserable you are,

525
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,626
even longer to see
it doesn't have to be that way.

526
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,883
Only after you give up everything
can you begin to find a way to be happy.

527
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:39,060
Can you believe that guy?
What a nut, right?

528
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,937
I just wanna go home.
