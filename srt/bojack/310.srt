-No, thank you, regular window!
-Tell me a little about your company.

164
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,059
Well, it started as a safe space
for women.

165
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:20,977
Ooh!

166
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,897
Then, it became a safe space
for women and men.

167
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,856
Oh!

168
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,859
Now, it's more
of a safe-ish space for women...

169
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,777
Mm-hmm.

170
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,780
...and a really safe space
for men to look at women...

171
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:33,698
I hear you.

172
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,658
...while also being driven around by them.

173
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,161
-Wow! Something for everyone.
-Demand is skyrocketing.

174
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,163
That's why we need a bigger office space.

175
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,832
You come to work, clock in,

176
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,292
you put sugar in your coffee,

177
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,587
and watch it slowly disappear
into nothingness.

178
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,673
But the sugar doesn't know why.
Sugar didn't ask to be born.

179
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,591
Is he okay?

180
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,884
He recently found out
that his brother's sick.

181
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,512
Oh. I'm so sorry,
but you know what else is sick?

182
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,681
-These hardwood floors.
-Ooh!

183
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,975
Did you hear that, Mr. Peanutbutter?

184
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,143
[sighs]

185
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,816
Losing BoJack was a blow.
There's no way to sugarcoat it,

186
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,611
even if I were generally good
at sugarcoating things, which I'm not.

187
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,072
[sighs] You know, I wish
cats really did have nine lives.

188
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,950
It would make me feel better
about how much I'm screwing up this one.

189
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,285
You're not screwing up your life.

190
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,330
Sometimes I feel like,
if I could start everything over,

191
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,583
knowing what I know now,
I'd do it all right this time.

192
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,501
But other times I think...
[sighs]

193
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,961
No, I wouldn't.

194
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,257
As you all know, things have been rough,

195
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,926
and, unfortunately,
we have to scale back our staff.

196
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,679
-Mainly, you.
-Are you firing me?

197
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,556
In a sense, yes.

198
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,975
But, in another sense,
I'm promoting you

199
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,561
to a position of finding a job
somewhere else.

200
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,940
Yeah. I don't think I ever thanked you
for giving me this job in the first place.

201
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,984
It was an honor to work with you.

202
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,738
You were the worst social media
coordinator this company ever had.

203
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,827
Are you sure you need surgery?
Can't you get a second opinion?

204
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,039
Second opinion? You know
there's only one doctor on the Peninsula.

205
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,416
I could ask him twice
if it'd make you feel better.

206
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,418
Nothing could make me
feel better right now.

207
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,463
Not even an amazing career opportunity.
Hold on, I'm getting another call.

208
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,758
I've got to take this. It could be
an amazing career opportunity. Hello?

209
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,386
[German accent]
Mr. Peanutbutter, this is Shep Von Trapp,

210
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,804
awards show producer,

211
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,639
with a career opportunity

212
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,226
that is... good.

213
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,186
This isn't a great time, Shep.
Could you call back?

214
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,687
Absolutely... not.

215
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,817
The Oscar nomination announcement
is in seven days and we don't have a host.

216
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,277
Sadly, Jimmy Fallon just broke his face.

217
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,947
What? Halloween in January?

218
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,074
What a crazy concept! I can't believe it!

219
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,159
I mean, what is this?
Barry Gibb would be like...

221
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,956

00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,175
You're our second "first choice."
What do you say?

226
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,887
Ooh, a job like that? You want
a fully present presenter to present.

227
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,681
And I don't know
if I've got the pep in my step

228
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,891
to take that show
where it needs to go, you know?

229
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,393
I've got a real pepless step, Shep.

230
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,062
Okay, well, let me know,
because if you don't want to do it,

231
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,898
we'll probably just post the list
of nominees online or something.

232
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,191
It's really not that big of a deal.

233
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,986
Hey, sorry about that.
Just got a call from the Oscars.

234
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,157
-They want me to host--
-They want you to host the Oscars?

235
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,575
Nomination announcement.

236
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,201
But I don't think
I have it in me right now.

237
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,412
Are you kidding?
You gotta take that gig.

238
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,414
-Really?
-Mr. Peanutbutter...

239
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,916
what did Nana Peanutbutter always say?

240
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,294
[both] "Always take every opportunity
that comes your way

241
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,921
because opportunities
are like sneezes from God,

242
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,507
and when God sneezes,
you can't say 'God bless you' to God,

243
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,342
so instead you have
to take the opportunity.

244
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,470
I'm cold. Will you pass me that blanket?"

245
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,972
Boy, that old gal had something
for everything, didn't she?

246
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,599
I know you're worried about me,

247
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,685
but sitting around the house worrying
isn't going to help anyone.

248
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,104
Okay, but you'll call me
when you get out of the surgery, right?

249
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,939
I'm not gonna let my phone leave my sight.

Of course. And now,
I've got something new to live for.

My little brother, telling the whole world
who got an Oscar!

We are minutes away.
Shep, release the envelope.

00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,207
Copy that. Releasing the envelope.

what about <i>Avatar?</i>

326
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,851
-That was a good movie.
-True, but did that come out this year?

327
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,688
-I feel like I just saw it.
-Well, there's no way to know for sure.

328
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,981
Let's just throw it on the list.

329
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,484
Ooh, do we have Daniel Day-Lewis
down for anything? He's always there.

330
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,902
Good catch! I'll add him.

331
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,028
Daniel Day-Lewis.

332
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:32,491
Okay. We need one more nominee
for Best Actor. Oh, what about BoJack?

333
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,244
His performance in <i>Secretariat</i>
was as thoughtful and self-aware

334
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,328
as we've ever seen him.

335
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,414
-Besides, he's our friend.
-Is he?

336
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,001
Whoa! I am surprised to hear
you say that, Todd Chavez.

337
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,545
-Let's dig into that. We have time.
-I don't think we do.

338
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,588
You're supposed to be
announcing these, like, now.

339
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,091
There is always time
to talk about our feelings.

340
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,176
As my Nana Peanutbutter used to say,

341
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,053
"There's always time
to talk about feelings,

342
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,556
because feelings
are the ceilings of our hearts,

343
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,392
and a leaky feeling ceiling
leads to a flood of blood.

344
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,519
And I'm cold.
Will you pass me that blanket?"

345
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,898
Well, I guess I'm just tired
of BoJack walking all over everybody

346
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,651
and still getting everything he wants.

347
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,987
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I think
the important thing to remember here

348
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,573
is that BoJack is a damaged individual,

349
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:16,910
struggling against a sea of demons,
many self-created, but still all too real.

350
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,747
Getting this nomination
from the two friends he loves the most--

351
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,499
you and also me--
would really mean a lot to him.

352
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,084
[sighs]
Okay.

353
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,336
But did you really think
he was that good in the movie?

354
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,048
Oh, I haven't seen it. It seemed long.

355
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,469
And the final nominee
for Best Picture is <i>Avatar.</i>

356
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,680
Well, those are all the nominations.
I will not be taking any questions.

357
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,182
Goodbye. I must go.

358
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,309
[audience clamoring]

359
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,813
I gotta say, we picked
some top-notch noms.

360
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,731
You know it!

361
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,900
Boy, was I glad when we got
out of that theater, though.

362
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,902
I know. So many questions.

363
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,613
"Oh, what the hell happened?

364
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:57,785
Why were you reading off that napkin?
Why are you guys running?"

365
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,079
They have their nominees.
What more could they want?

366
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,998
You know what's crazy?
We saved the day today,

367
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,751
and no one will ever even know.

368
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,879
-Hey, we'll know.
-[doorbell rings]

369
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,925
Mr. Peanutbutter, we know what you did.

370
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:13,926
Oh, boy.

371
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:18,347
So, the good news is,
my brother's surgery was a success.

372
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,724
And the bad news is,
you're not nominated for an Oscar.

373
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,434
And the other good news is...

374
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,144
[voice fading out]
...that each breath is a gift

375
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,979
and it is a joy to live.

376
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,816
-What?
-We are so lucky we get to be alive.

377
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,943
-No, before that.
-Oh, I didn't tell you.

378
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,904
-My brother's been sick.
-No, I don't care about your brother.

379
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,072
First of all, manners.

380
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,283
Second of all, I think if you met him,
you'd actually really hit it off.

381
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,036
Imagine me but with less
"in your face" cool guy attitude.

382
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,955
Did you say I'm not nominated
for an Oscar?

383
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,039
Oh...

384
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,791
A lot of people are mighty steamed,

385
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,335
but I feel like what everyone's
overlooking here is,

386
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,587
I got most of the categories dead-on.

387
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,340
That's pretty amazing, and I am not
getting enough credit for that.

388
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,843
Did you know
that <i>Avatar </i>came out in 2009?

389
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,011
-I'm not nominated for an Oscar.
-No.

390
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,848
But you know what they say.
"It's an honor just to be nominated."

391
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,932
Oh, wait.

392
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,309
So, I'm just like everybody else.

393
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,312
I know you're upset, but whatever you do,
please don't get mad at Todd.

394
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,732
-Why would I get mad at Todd?
-Exactly. This is totally my fault.

395
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,609
-He didn't even want to nominate you.
-What?

396
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,819
With the gift of hindsight,

397
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,530
I see now how that might have
made you even more upset.

398
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,449
But I realized something today,
when my brother called from the hospital,

399
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,785
and I think it's gonna
make you feel a lot better.

400
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,164
-What? What is it?
-None of this matters.

401
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,124
Okay, I'll see you later, buddy.

402
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,585
[whistling]

403
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,422
[inaudible dialogue]

404
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,715
As a partner in the company,

405
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,176
I am prepared to forgo my salary
for the next three months,

406
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,636
but even then, we're going
to need some sort of miracle.

407
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,472
What are we doing?
What was the point of any of this?

408
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,100
I wasted everyone's time for six months.

409
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,061
Soon, I'll get some offer
from one of the big five agencies

410
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,646
that I can't say no to,

411
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,106
and I'll go back to being another cog

412
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,818
in the giant Play-Doh spaghetti maker
that is this industry.

413
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,321
-Is that the best I can hope for?
-Not necessarily.

414
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,823
Although, there is one thing
I should probably mention.

415
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,200
What is it, Judah?

416
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:06,205
Maybe this is an opportunity
to live one of your other eight lives.

417
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,374
Yeah, maybe.

418
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,919
It's been a pleasure
working with you, Judah.

419
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,213
I found it to be
an above average experience.

420
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,798
Please forgive me for getting emotional.

421
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,300
[sighs]

422
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,265
[Southern accent]
Rye, wheat, or sourdough?

423
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,267
Can I get it on stale?

424
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,729
And then, he said,
I fetishize my own sadness.

425
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,482
[laughing] What did you think was
gonna happen? Why did you go there?

426
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,733
I don't know.

427
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,652
-Did you ask for water?
-No.

428
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,112
They're not supposed to give us water
unless we ask.

429
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,241
-Don't they know there's a drought?
-You want to send the water back?

430
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,159
No, I want the water. I just...

431
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,703
I went to BoJack's house
to congratulate him.

432
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,163
I'm not trying to pick fights.

433
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,582
Well, you don't have to see him at all
if you don't want to.

434
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,334
It's not like you work for him anymore.

435
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,545
-Is he right? Am I a bad person?
-Who cares what he thinks?

436
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,507
Why do you have
this weird fixation with him?

437
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,261
I do not have a fixation, Roxy.
I worry about him.

438
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,512
Okay. And last year?

439
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,973
When you came back from Cordovia
and needed a place to crash?

440
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,642
Oh, you could have stayed with me,
or any of your other friends,

441
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,185
but you went right to his house.

442
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,729
Did you ever ask yourself why?

443
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,358
They're filling everyone's glasses.
This is insane.

444
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,694
Oh, my God. What do you care?

445
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,362
Hey, excuse me? Excuse me?

446
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,490
Do you know you're breaking the law
by giving everybody water?

447
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,741
It's okay. I want the water.

448
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,911
Yeah, we all want water.
That's not the point.

449
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,956
In the state of California,
it is illegal for a restaurant

450
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,792
to serve people water
before they ask for it.

451
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,920
There is a drought.

452
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,714
Sit down! We're thirsty!

453
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,758
[scoffs] You know,
this is what's wrong with society.

454
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,718
Diane...

455
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,762
Nobody thinks about the world
outside themselves.

456
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,517
So, how you doing?
You still working at that place?

457
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,478
[line ringing]

458
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,064
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hi, Ralph. It's Princess Carolyn.

459
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,234
<i>Oh, my God, Princess Carolyn,</i>
<i>I never thought I'd hear from you again.</i>

460
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,986
I might have some free time coming up.

461
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,155
I was wondering
if you might want to get a drink.

462
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:07,409
<i>Okay. So, the night I met you after I said</i>
<i>goodbye, the craziest thing happened.</i>

463
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,493
Okay?

464
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,579
<i>I was walking back to my car,</i>
<i>when all of a sudden,</i>

465
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,289
<i>-this woman...</i>
-[Carolyn] <i>Oh.</i>

466
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,249
<i>...tripped on a cobblestone,</i>
<i>twisted her ankle,</i>

467
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,168
<i>-and tumbled into my arms.</i>
-[Carolyn] <i>What?</i>

468
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,171
<i>Turns out, she was a ballerina,</i>
<i>and she didn't speak a word of English.</i>

469
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,923
<i>So, I rushed her to the hospital,</i>
<i>and long story short, we eloped.</i>

470
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,175
-[Carolyn] <i>Oh.</i>
-I moved to Russia,

471
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,384
and I'm totally messing with you.

472
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,552
-None of that's true.
-<i>What?</i>

473
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,763
I would love to see you again.
I think about you all the time.

474
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,682
-Really? [chuckles]
<i>-Yeah. How about this Saturday?</i>

475
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,808
It's a date.

476
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,607
-[metal clattering]
-Ana?

477
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,110
Uh, no, it's just me,
giant chocolate Oscar guy.

478
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,362
I'm here to pick up
the giant chocolate Oscar.

479
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:49,034
My boss really wants our product
to only be seen with real Oscar nominees.

480
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,870
You know, to maintain the integrity
of the giant chocolate Oscar.

481
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,705
I don't care. Take it.

482
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,708
<i>You've reached Ana Spanakopita.</i>

483
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,628
<i>How did you get this number?</i>
<i>Explain yourself.</i>

484
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,963
-[line beeps]
-Ana, this is the fourth time I've called.

485
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,049
Please call me back. I need you.

486
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:08,011
Ana, please.
This is BoJack, by the way. Horseman.

487
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,389
Hey! Todd! Where you been?

488
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,016
-Oh, hi.
-You were in Ojai?

489
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,061
-No, I was just saying hi.
-Well, why not go to Ojai, huh?

490
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,271
You and me?
I could use an escape, couldn't you?

491
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,940
It's not really a good time.

492
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,484
Todd, I need this.
You're my best friend and I need you.

493
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,945
Don't leave me now.
Don't be like everybody else.

494
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,613
I'm not leaving you. I just--

495
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:30,367
Besides, I think you owe me, right?
After what you did?

496
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,494
-What I did?
-Come on, Todd. I know.

497
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,247
-Mr. Peanutbutter told me everything.
-Everything?

498
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,834
Even told you, when I was a kid, I used
to bang on my butt like a bongo drum

499
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,794
-when I got out of the bath?
-What?

500
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,588
<i>♪ Todd-o, me and Todd-o ♪</i>

501
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,050
<i>♪ Bath time come</i>
<i>Make Todd shiny and clean ♪</i>

502
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,469
Mm, no, not-not about that.

503
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,471
So, he didn't tell you everything.

504
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,723
Did he tell you about the time
I counted to a million?

505
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:58,311
One, two, three, four, five, six--

506
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,022
-No, stop.
-But I was just getting to the good part!

507
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,693
What? Seven? He told me you didn't want
to nominate me for an Oscar.

508
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,444
-Oh, that.
-What the hell, man?

509
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,655
-After everything I've done for you?
-What are you talking about?

510
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,533
Oh, I don't know. Letting you live here
for free for six years?

511
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,244
Giving you food, indulging you
in your little projects and adventures

512
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,164
and stories about how you used to bang
on your butt like a bongo drum?

513
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,331
I let you turn my house

514
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,916
into your company's headquarters
for the last month.

515
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,877
Yeah, but that's not
because you're my friend.

516
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,088
-That's because you felt bad about Emily.
-You know about Emily?

517
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,466
I think I know.
Why? What do you think I know?

518
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,801
I mean, I know what I think,

519
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,680
but I don't know if the thing that I think
is the thing that you think I know.

520
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,141
-You know?
-So, you know I had sex with Emily.

521
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,476
You had sex with Emily?!

522
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,104
-Well, what did you think?
-I don't know! Not that!

523
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,939
I just knew something sketchy happened.

524
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,233
I thought maybe you gave her
one of your weird monologues

525
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,526
about how sad you are,

526
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,611
and it bummed her out!

527
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,988
Todd, I'm sorry, all right?
I screwed up.

528
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:54,159
-I know I screwed up. I don't know why--
-Oh, great! Of course! Here it comes!

529
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,827
You can't keep doing this!

530
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,581
You can't keep doing shitty things,
and then feel bad about yourself

531
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,416
like that makes it okay!

532
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,919
You need to be better!

533
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,712
I know. And I'm sorry, okay?

534
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:09,758
I was drunk, and there was all this
pressure with the Oscar campaign.

535
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:15,138
-But now-- Now that it's over, I--
-No! No, BoJack, just stop.

536
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,016
You are all the things
that are wrong with you.

537
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,268
It's not the alcohol, or the drugs,

538
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,271
or any of the shitty things
that happened to you in your career,

539
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,522
or when you were a kid.

540
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,066
It's you.

541
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,903
All right? It's you.

542
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,534
