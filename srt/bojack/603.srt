Crooshing USA.

[man] <i>What does that mean?</i>

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,470
Crooshness is hard to define,
but I also don't know it when I see it.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,513
Oop. Pardon my reach.

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,516
Well, I'm always trying to get more girls
interested in agriculture.

6
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:21,062
You might say I've got my eyes on them.
Potato eyes, that is.

00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,022
-Guy?
-[Guy] Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,735
Hey, girls! It's Diane,
outside Idaho's largest potato supplier,

00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,236
-Starch Farms.
-Hello!

10
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,279
Let me get this straight.

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,283
Your farm harvests five types of potatoes,
two types of onions,

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,869
and is also a front
for a local sex trafficking ring?

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,997
-[gasps]
-How'd you get started in sex trafficking?

14
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,499
Uh...

so we have something to cut away to

25
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,315
when I have to scratch my nose?

26
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,151
I thought scratching your nose
was your way of saying hello to me.

27
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,655
{\an8}<i>Don't you find it a little convenient</i>

<i>You think this is convenient?</i>

30
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,831
The East Side is a lower-income area,
ergo the residents

31
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,042
are not huge campaign donors, ergo--

32
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,711
No, the mayor
didn't target that neighborhood,

33
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,255
he was just that stupid
when it came to water filtration.

34
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,175
He was just stupid enough to think
he wouldn't get caught, ergo--

35
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,719
Say "ergo" one more time.

36
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,679
-Ergo.
-Nah.

about Philip Morris Disney Fox

44
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,403
-What about them?
-They got acquired by Whitewhale.

45
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,406
Oh, shit.
Well, how many companies are there now?

46
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,825
Four? [gasps]

47
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,535
-What is it?
-I'm sorry, Diane.

48
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,079
Look, I asked for two beds, I swear.

49
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,707
-Huh.
-I mean, this is unprofessional. One bed!

50
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,668
What are we supposed to do
with just one bed?

51
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,128
Quite a pickle.

52
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,381
I should march right back down
to that front desk and tell them--

will play in the future of this company.

and closing the main Chicago factory
so we can relocate overseas

157

00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,297
God, I'm freezing.

166
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,550
-Aw.
-So, you, uh...

167
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,636
-You wanna watch the game with us?
-Are you asking me to meet your friends?

168
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,431
No, I just figure,
since you're staying with me anyway--

169
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,684
I would be delighted. Wait, it's not
the Chicago Baby Humans game, is it?

170
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,685
It's just a mascot.

171
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,772
[reporter] <i>And there goes Waa-Waa,</i>
<i>the Baby Human, stumbling around</i>

172
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,108
<i>like the furless, featherless dolt he is.</i>

173
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,904
<i>What's he got there?</i>
<i>Don't drink that poison, you crazy human!</i>

174
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,990
-We don't drink poison.
-Diane, he's not a literal human.

175
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,826
Waa-Waa is a tribute
to your proud human heritage.

176
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,204
-I'm very flattered.
-Anyway, meet the gang.

177
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,748
Everyone, this is Diane. My, um...

178
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,125
Ah... You know, my--
The woman that I work with.

179
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,502
-[all] Hi.
-[man] 'Sup, dude?

180
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,463
-Hmm...
-You okay?

181
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,924
Yeah. Sorry, just-- I'll be right back.

182
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,968

[sighs]

184
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,063
-Diane, I'm really sorry, but--
-It's fine.

185
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,023
I wasn't expecting, ya know,
in front of your friends.

186
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,900
-He just showed up.
-We haven't put a label on us.

187
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,860
-I'm not looking for--
-The speech and debate tournament

188
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,738
-was canceled on account of cyberbullying.
-Wait, what are you talking about?

189
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,907
-My son is here. He surprised me.
-Oh, shit.

190
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,244
I usually don't bring women around my kid
unless it's serious.

191
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,662
-I get it.
-Do you mind staying at a hotel?

192
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,789
-Oh, yeah. Totally.
-He'll be gone first thing tomorrow.

193
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,457
What if he sees me go out?
Is the coast clear?

194
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,584
-You should maybe go out the window.
-[grunts]

195
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,670
This makes sense. But what about my stuff?

196
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,088
I'll pack your bag
and throw it out to you.

197
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,507
Okay, good. Bye.
Thank you for inviting me to your party.

198
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,466
You have a lovely home.

[BoJack's voice] <i>Dear Diane, hello.</i>
<i>I am writing you another letter.</i>

200
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,641
<i>Today sucks. There's this new lady here,</i>
<i>Beverly, and she took my snack kit.</i>

201
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,770
<i>And that is so classic Beverly.</i>
<i>Probably. I just met her.</i>

202
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,731
<i>The whole point of the snack kits</i>
<i>is they're communal, right?</i>

203
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,900
<i>They're these bags full of snacks</i>
<i>that we take on our morning hikes,</i>

204
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,612
<i>and we put them together the night before</i>
<i>as, like, a team-building thing.</i>

205
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,033
<i>Yesterday, I decided to throw an extra bag</i>
<i>of candied nuts into a snack kit,</i>

206
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,285
<i>something just for me.</i>

207
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,494
<i>And I marked my bag with a "B"</i>

208
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,954
<i>so I'd know which one to grab</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

209
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:40,955
<i>"B" for "BoJack."</i>

210
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,748
-[groans angrily]
<i>-But then today, I see Beverly,</i>

211
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,167
<i>who, again, just got here,</i>
<i>waltzing around the house</i>

212
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,005
<i>with my snack kit, saying, "Oh, somebody</i>
<i>made a special kit just for me!</i>

213
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,592
<i>B for Beverly!</i>
<i>I must have a secret admirer!"</i>

214
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,343
<i>Again, just got here!</i>

215
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,803
-[shivering]
<i>-The story of my life</i>

216
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,388
<i>is that I never get anything nice.</i>

217
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,849
<i>You'd think that I'd learn to adjust</i>
<i>my expectations by now.</i>

218
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,517
<i>But, no. Once again,</i>

219
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,604
<i>I was the idiot</i>
<i>who got my hopes up about candied nuts,</i>

220
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,983
<i>and now I am disappointed</i>
<i>with no one to blame but myself.</i>

221
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,736
-[sighs]
<i>-Anyway, what's new with you?</i>

222
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,614
[scoffs]<i> Just kidding,</i>
<i>you can't say anything, this is a letter!</i>

223
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,116

-Hello?
-[Stefani] <i>Diane, your last video--</i>

228
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,340
Okay, I know it wasn't as feel-good
as maybe you wanted--

229
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,008
Are you kidding? I feel great!

230
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,135
You made a big impression with the guys
at Whitewhale.

231
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,722
-Really?
-I'll say. They bought Girl Croosh!

232
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,516
-What?
-Well, technically they bought Fuddruckers

233
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,479
and merged it with Dow Chemical to create
a new media venture called Spronk!

234
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,522
<i>-</i>[Diane] <i>Hold on--</i>
-Spronk acquired Univision,

235
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,692
which will incorporate Girl Croosh
into the Gizmodo-branded mist

236
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,943
of advertorial.

237
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,404
-That's terrible!
-Not for me! I'm gonna be rich!

238
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,324
-You already are rich!
-Oh, yeah! [giggles]

239
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:02,203
Oops. Well, anyway, good luck with Spronk,
which is currently rebranding

240
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,329
as Content Spew.

241
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,498
So spew that content, girl! [giggles]

Pardon our dust

Can I get you a Pepsi Cola?
Or anything else from the vast Whitewhale

00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:01,846
<i>You summoned us here to tell your new</i>

00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,933
<i>Well, best be quick about it,</i>
<i>you unholy apparitions.</i>

262
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,478
<i>The Whitewhale Way was developed</i>
<i>by Ezekiel Whitewhale,</i>

263
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:14,483
<i>who started small with a modest petroleum</i>
<i>refinery he inherited from his father.</i>

264
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,486
[Ollie]
<i>One day he looked around and said,</i>

265
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,529
<i>"Wait one minute!</i>

266
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:22,116
<i>While I'm refining this oil, someone else</i>
<i>is getting rich drilling it,</i>

267
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,578
<i>and another someone's sellin' it</i>
<i>to the common commuter!"</i>

268
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,622
<i>So, he bought his own rig</i>
<i>and opened a chain of gas stations.</i>

269
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,001
<i>By controlling both the means</i>
<i>of production and the delivery system,</i>

270
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,629
<i>Ezekiel cornered the market</i>
<i>and choked out the competition</i>

271
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,299
<i>until they had no choice</i>
<i>but to sell to him, too!</i>

272
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,343
<i>And that's vertical integration! </i>[burps]

273
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,262

<i>F-f-f-f-fast-forward to the 1980s,</i>

284
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,802
Please be mindful of them
as you spew your content. [sputters]

285
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,932
So we can't make videos
about any of these subsidiaries?

286
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,435
Monsanto, JP Morgan Chase,
Marie Osmond?

287
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,230
Oh! There it is,
the Every Animal Girl Company.

288
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,608
You don't really think Whitewhale bought
Girl Croosh just to kill our video?

289
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,027
And you couldn't just tell
a feel-good story about two friends

290
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,278
who started a business.

291
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,905
Maybe this is for the best.

292
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,699
You can get a new job in Chicago,
spend more time with your kid.

293
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,159
Yeah, and you can go back to LA,

294
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,203
where you won't have to borrow my coat
all the time.

295
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,746
-[giggles]
-Didn't you wanna write another book?

296
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,873
I have this book of essays
I've been brewing in my head.

297
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,417
It's called, <i>One Last Thing</i>
<i>and Then I Swear to God I'll Shut Up</i>

<i>About This Forever: Dispatches</i>

<i>Recollections, The Razor Tax--</i>

Is this still the title?

301
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,885
I kind of got lost in the middle
 and couldn't find a way out.

302
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,136
No, no, it's good,

303
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,430
I just think you want to save some of it
for the inside of the book.

304
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,809
[sighs] I guess that's it for us,
though, right?

305
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:16,772
-I guess so. Unless it isn't it for us?
-What do you mean?

306
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,608
What if we did one more video
about anything we wanted

307
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,070
and posted it on the website before they 
realize we still have all the passwords?

308
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,824
-We could do a story about Whitewhale.
-Oh, yeah!

309
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,826
Now, there's a feel-good story.

310
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,955
Me feeling good about takin'
those assholes down!

311
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,718
Diane, this is Isabel,
star reporter at <i>The Tribune.</i>

312
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,595
She's been hunting Whitewhale for years.

313

-Call me... Isabel.
-Okay.

314
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,435
All my days, the beast has haunted me.

315
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,104
The hunt consumes my every waking moment.

316
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,024
You might even say Whitewhale is my...

317
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,152
green light at the end of the dock.

318
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,196
-What?
-That's a <i>Gatsby</i> reference. Read a book.

319
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,364
Isabel, be nice.

320
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,326
I wish I had the energy,
but my obsession has ruined me.

321
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,788
Destroyed my relationships,
obliterated my career. And for nothing.

322
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,459
I had one contact on the warehouse floor,
Matt Minnowman.

323
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,127
-Hmm.
-Then he disappeared.

324
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,463
-Maybe there's your story.
-Not your story?

325
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,675
Mm. My editor thought I was getting
"too invested" in the Whitewhale beat,

326
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,677
so he moved me
to the Holiday Gift Guide desk.

327
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,306
Now the search for the season's hot toy
torments my waking days.

328
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,269
Are spirographs the new fidget spinners?
The answer eludes me at every turn.

329
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,775
[Diane] I can't believe it. We got a lead.

330
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,361
Hey, do you wanna walk back to my place?

331
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,822
Are you kidding? It's so cold.
How is it snowing in October?

332
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,701
There are basically two seasons here:
bitter winter, unbearable humidity.

333
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,828
-You'll learn to love it.
-[giggles]

334
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,372
-[Diane gasping]
-[both giggling]

335
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,041
[BoJack's voice]
<i>Dear Diane, I'm sure you are dying to know</i>

336
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,669
<i>how this Beverly</i>
<i>secret admirer situation is going,</i>

337
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,796
<i>-so I'll cut right to the chase.</i>
-[Guy] Oh!

338
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,383
<i>I started writing "BH" on my snack kits</i>
<i>to clear up any confusion</i>

339
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,676
<i>about who the extra nuts are for.</i>

340
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,889
<i>But now Beverly thinks "BH"</i>
<i>stands for Beverly, here-ya-go.</i>

341
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,642
<i>"Beverly here ya go"?</i>
<i>Why would the "H" stand for--</i>

342
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,061
-[Guy and Diane moan]
<i>-You know what? Doesn't matter.</i>

343
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,939
<i>The dumbest part is that Beverly doesn't</i>
<i>even eat candied nuts.</i>

344
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,148
-[Diane moaning]
<i>-She's allergic.</i>

345
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,775
<i>So she usually just ends up</i>

346
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,151
<i>-giving her nuts to me.</i>
-[Guy snores]

347
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,278
<i>Doctor Champ would probably say</i>
<i>that means something.</i>

348
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,865
<i>That the universe has a way of looking out</i>
<i>for us if we just stop fighting it, but...</i>

349
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,617
<i>I don't know.</i>

350
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,078
<i>Anyway, I guess it's working.</i>

351
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,999
<i>Hope things are working</i>
<i>for you, too. BoJack.</i>

352
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,834
[keyboard clacking]

353
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,128
Were you up all night?

354
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,088
I was following up on this Matt Minnowman.

355
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,841
Turns out there was an "accident"
at the warehouse.

356
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,718
-What?
-He stayed late to finish some work.

357
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,761
"Look at me, I'm just doing some work.
It's no big deal."

358
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,388
Next morning, they found him dead.

359
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,514
Oh, shit.

360
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,434
This guy was trying to get the word out
about working conditions,

361
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,936
and then he died in the warehouse.

362
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,147
I got the names of some coworkers,
let's get our hands

363
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,231
on the security footage.

364
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,233
Did you know your cereal
was made by Whitewhale?

365
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,317
I threw it out to be safe.

366
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,528
Microchips-- Oh, my God,
you're looking at me like I'm crazy.

367
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,114
You think I'm obsessed.
Am I totally scaring you off right now?

368
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,074
No. You're glowing.

369
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,743
Hmm.

370
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,370
[keyboard clacking]

371
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,915
We were working 17-hour days.

372
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,918
We were spread thinner
than a shitty New York slice of pizza

373
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,087
and working harder than the '96 Bulls.

374
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,674
[Guy] Okay, so Matt's stationed here...

375
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,635
So, what, he walked to the other side
of the room just to die?

376
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,220
That's where he died, all right.

377
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,598
Management left his body out there
on the floor.

378
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,309
Almost like it was a warning
to the other workers.

379
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,643
Wow.

380
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,521
I just don't think you can attribute it
to intentional cruelty.

381
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,315
-It's callousness.
-Can't it be both?

382
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,442
Whitewhale's not evil.
They're just capitalists.

383
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,860
What's the difference?

384
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,279
<i>From</i> New York Times,
<i>I'm Michael Barbaro. Today--</i>

385
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,907
-Hello?
-Mister Whitewhale would like to meet you

386
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,785
at the Chicago Whitewhale building
tomorrow at 2:00.

387
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,828
Bring your camera. [sputters]

388
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,166
Oh, shit. If they know what we're doing,
why would they wanna talk to us?

389
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,417
I guess we'll find out.

390
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,669
I'm kind of weirdly excited.

391
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,923
-Hey. I got you something.
-What? Shut up!

392
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,467
-Huh.
-Ah.

393
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,219
-You don't like it.
-No, I love it.

394
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,472
It's just I won't get much use
out of a coat like this in LA.

395
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,681
No. It's for here.

396
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,226
Is this your way of asking me
to move to Chicago?

397
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:27,064
[chuckles] No. Not everything is some kind
of secret underhanded conspiracy.

398
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,817
-Sometimes a coat's just a coat.
-Okay.

399
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,861
But I also don't know why it's so obvious
that you go back to LA.

400
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,030
-I live there.
-But there's nothing for you there.

401
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:35,989
Excuse me?

402
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,867
I just don't understand
why you're so into punishing yourself.

403
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,785
I am not--

404
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,621
And it's not just yourself,
because every time you get cold,

405
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,208
-guess who has to give you his coat.
-Oh, sorry, does that inconvenience you?

406
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,292
No. [sighs]

407
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,253
I just don't know
why I should suffer

408
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,922
because you have this ideological
objection to feeling good.

409
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,591
Are you-- I would love to feel good.

410
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,344
What a luxury. How nice for you
that you can do that

411
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,929
while the world burns around you.

412
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,682
This is not even about the world,
this is about you and me.

413
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,350
"You and me"?
What's "you and me"?

414
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,394
-Don't--
-No, no, tell me, Guy, please,

415
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,188
because I would love some clarification.
Am I your girlfriend?

416
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,733
Am I the, um,
"you know, woman that I work with"?

417
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,819
-Come on, Diane.
-What is this?

418
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,573
I... Just take the coat.

419
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,325
I think I should go back to the hotel.

420
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,661
[sighs]

421
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,423
[Diane shudders]

422
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,926
[birds chirping]

423
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,266
I didn't know if you'd come.

424
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,520
Well, we got a job to do, right?
Could get chilly up there.

425
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,526
I don't know what kind of video
you're putting together,

426
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,321
but I wanted to let you know I don't mind.

427
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,739
You're not gonna stop us.

428
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,241
I don't want to stop you,
I just said that.

429
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:05,162
See, when you put out stories about us
being "evil" or "callous"

430
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,831
or whoever the bad guy in <i>Harry Potter</i> is,

431
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:12,920
people think our business is uncompromised
by morality and our stock goes up.

432
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,715
So, it doesn't bother your shareholders
that one of your employees died

433
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,258
in a work-related accident?

434
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,886
-What accident?
-Matt Minnowman's body was found

435
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,137
in your warehouse.

436
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,724
Oh, him, sure!
But that was no accident. I killed him.

437
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,351
-What?
-I murdered him!

438
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,977
Like <i>murdered</i> murdered him?

439
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,480
Well, I didn't murder-of-crows him.

440
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,733
He took too many bathroom breaks
and encouraged the other employees

441
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,485
to take bathroom breaks as well.

442
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,072
And you're not worried it's going
to get out that you killed an employee?

443
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,532
Like in the video
we're shooting right now?

444
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,954
Didn't you hear? Congress just passed
a bill legalizing murder if you're rich.

445
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,915
-No, they didn't-- Oh, my God, they did!
-What?

446
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,459
Hold on. Just because it passed
the House doesn't mean the Senate will--

447
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,543
Really, Diane?

448
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,087
Okay, but the president could still veto--

449
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,338
Really, Diane?

450
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,590
All right, sure, but the Supreme Court.
Okay, I get it.

451
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,550
Look, don't take it so hard.

452
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:05,305
If you wanna do something about it,
just make a billion dollars and murder me!

453
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,932
[both cackle]

454
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,936
Barbara, let's make sure they get
a nice Whitewhale Company gift bag

455
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,230
-on their way out.
-[sputters]

456
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,194
Well, we can still post the video.

457
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,321
Why?

458
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,743
Yeah, right, well, um, safe travels.
It's been real.

459
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,663
Yeah. It's been real.

460
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,544
I'm not gonna beg you to stay
if that's what you're waiting for.

461
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,670
I'm not waiting for anything.

462
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,882
I'm not that guy who says, "Diane,
please don't go, I'm in love with you.

463
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,176
Stay here in Chicago
and write your book of essays

464
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,886
and come with me to baseball games.

465
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,889
They've got a pretty good theater scene
here and a big shiny bean and you could...

466
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,349
[sighs]

467
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,727
You could be so happy
in your warm winter coat."

468
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,855
-I don't need you to say--
-I'm not gonna be that guy, all right?

469
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,859
But if you wanted to stay, I could
make things so good for you, Diane.

470
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,237
-Listen--
-No, no, I get it.

471
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,531
No, listen. Guy.

472
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,577
I feel so shitty all the time.

473
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:14,624
I feel like the whole world is pushing in
on me, except for when I'm with you.

474
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,712
You have been such a good thing for me.

475
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:24,509
But I can't be with you
if you're the only good thing in my life.

476
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,054
It's too much pressure. I'm sorry.

477
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,183
-Diane! Don't get on that train!
-[scoffs]

478
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,353
-Guy, I just told you--
-I know, but you're going to the airport.

479
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,772
That train's going to Cottage Grove,
you're gonna get screwed!

480
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,690
Oh, no.

{\an8}[BoJack's voice] <i>Dear Diane,</i>
<i>it was Beverly's last day yesterday.</i>

482
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,033
{\an8}<i>Everyone is real excited for her,</i>
<i>but she spent the whole day sulking</i>

483
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,161
<i>because she never found out</i>
<i>who her secret admirer was.</i>

484
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,247
<i>Frankly, it was getting pretty annoying,</i>
<i>so finally I just say,</i>

485
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,541
<i>"It was me! I'm in love with you!"</i>

486
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,379
<i>And she goes,</i>
<i>"Oh. I was hoping it was Mario."</i>

487
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,589
<i>And then she starts crying.</i>

488
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:07,260
<i>And everyone looks at me like, "Way to go,</i>
<i>you made Beverly cry on her last day."</i>

489
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,472
<i>So, the thing I keep thinking about is...</i>

490
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,101
<i>was it worth it for Beverly to be happy</i>
<i>for a little bit,</i>

491
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,186
<i>even though it ended up sad?</i>

492
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,522
<i>Or would it have been better</i>
<i>if the whole thing never happened?</i>

493
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,732
<i>Every time someone leaves rehab...</i>

494
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,402
<i>it makes you think</i>
<i>about your own progress.</i>

495
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,238
<i>Some days it feels like you're not</i>
<i>progressing at all, other days you think,</i>

496
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,948
<i>"Well, maybe a little."</i>

497
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,866
<i>The main thing I think about</i>
<i>is how stupid I am</i>

498
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,451
<i>that I didn't do this sooner.</i>

499
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,788
<i>I wasted so many years being miserable</i>
<i>because I assumed</i>

500
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,706
<i>that was the only way to be.</i>

501
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,042
<i>But I don't wanna do that anymore.</i>

502
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,380
<i>Also, am I crazy or have I gotten</i>
<i>really good at writing letters?</i>

503
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,714
[sighs]

504
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,425
<i>This is BoJack, by the way.</i>

-[phone beeps]
-[line ringing]

506
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,973
-Hey.
-Hey.

507
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,518
I was thinking about these grilled cheese
sandwiches I used to make,

508
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,145
back when I first moved to LA.

509
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,896
-What?
-I was dirt-broke,

510
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,107
and I had no friends and no job,

511
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,735
and I got obsessed with perfecting
the art of the grilled cheese sandwich.

512
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,696
-Makes sense.
-Partly because it was cheap,

513
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,948
but also because while I was doing it,

514
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,409
I wasn't thinking about how depressing
my life was.

515
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,452
Okay.

516
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,662
So, on the plane I was thinking,

517
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,789
I should make
another grilled cheese sandwich

518
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,251
because I haven't in a long time,
but I love them

519
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,296
and they always make me feel better
about things.

520
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,839
-Look, Diane, I gotta--
-And the thing about

521
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:31,219
making your own grilled cheese sandwich
is you can do it anywhere. You know?

522
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,263
Yeah?

523
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,349
Yeah.
So, I guess that's another good thing.
