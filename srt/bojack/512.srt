00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,553
[Todd] You shut down production?

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,138
Just for a couple of days.

3
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,806
What is going on over there?

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,643
-It's a minor injury issue.
-A stunt went slightly awry.

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,561
Again?

6
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,354
And one of our stars
got a little strangled.

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,023
-What?
-Just a little strangled.

8
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,899
Like, the minimum amount of strangled.

9
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,153
Everyone's fine now.
It's like it didn't even happen.

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,196
-Except...
-Except what?

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,324
Some crew members might have taken
some video of the incident

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,201
that could leak to the press
at any moment.

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,119
But that's it!

14
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,579
Okay, I'm pulling the plug.

15
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,496
-[Flip] What?
-No!

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,540
It's too dangerous!
We gotta cut our losses.

17
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,334
Cut your losses?
<i>Philbert</i> is a monster hit!

18
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,961
We put your site on the map, boy-o,

19
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,213
so don't get squeamish now
about sunk cost.

20
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,507
Face it: You need us
like a fish needs a bicycle

21
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,052
in Portland, Austin, Boulder,
or Minneapolis, Saint Paul!

22
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,428
You are out of order.

23
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,723
Fine. Switch Boulder and Austin
and move the Twin Cities to the front.

24
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,768
Now, can you give me a chance
to get everything under control?

25
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,396
-[Henry slams door] <i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>
-[Todd sighs] You have one more chance.

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,523
Do you promise me
you can take care of this?

27
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,443
I'm clearing my docket.
This is my only priority.

28
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,945
Good,
because my boss has made it very clear

29
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:15,658
that if we let him down, he will, quote,
"eat my ass for dinner."

30
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,204

{\an8}Hey, buddy, well, how ya feeling today?

34
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,853
{\an8}Weird.
Am I supposed to be on set right now?

35
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,230
{\an8}You just stay right there.
I'm coming over.

36
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,773
{\an8}-Okay.
-Do me a favor, though?

37
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,025
{\an8}Maybe don't watch any TV,
or go on the Internet,

38
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,903
{\an8}or take any phone calls
from anybody else until I get there, okay?

-What up?

42
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,534
{\an8}Draft an email to Biscuits Braxby.

43
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:43,121
{\an8}I wanna set up an interview for--
Hold on, I'm getting another call.

44
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,039
{\an8}You want that part in the email?

45
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,167
-Hello?
-Princess Carolyn! It's Sadie.

46
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,836
Remember me? You wanted my baby,
and you came down to Eden,

47
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,339
then you thought about your past a lot,
and I decided not to give you my baby?

48
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,302
Of course I remember you, Sadie.
Unfortunately, this isn't a great time.

49
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,388
Anyway, I got to thinking... I interviewed
a lot of people for adoption.

50
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,390
After I said
I wasn't gonna give them the baby,

51
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,602
They all went cold or nasty. Except you.
You were still nice.

52
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,687
-[tires screech]
-I think that's a sign. [grunts]

53
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,731
{\an8}-How fast can you get to Eden?
-Why?

54
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,649
{\an8}My boyfriend left me,
my mama stole my truck,

55
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,068
{\an8}-and I don't want this baby no more.
-Oh, fish, Sadie.

56
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,987
{\an8}I'm kind of in the middle
of something now.

57
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,697
You're in the middle of something?

58
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,908
I'm about as deep in contractions
as an apostrophe!

59
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,119
{\an8}-[panting]
-I know. This is all just coming so fast.

60
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,412
I... Let me call you back.

61
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,081
Okay, but if this baby pops out
and you're not here,

62
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,125
-I'm putting it in a dumpster.
-[gasps]

63
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,087
I'm kidding,
I'm giving it to someone else. [grunts]

64
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,426
-Hey.
-Hi.

65
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,429
I always forget how tiny
and Dickensian this place is.

66
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:45,016
It's really great how you don't need
nice things to be happy.

67
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,518
-Yes, I agree. What do you want?
-[door closes]

68
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,812
{\an8}For the last couple months,
I've had work to distract me,

69
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,942
{\an8}but now that we're on strangle hiatus,
I can't stop thinking about that "thing"

70
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,818
{\an8}that happened in the prepiere
of the <i>Philbert.</i>

71
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,820
-"Strangle hiatus?"
-Diane, stay on topic.

72
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,365
-You know what "thing" I'm talking about?
-Yes.

73
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,741
-The thing between us?
-Got it.

74
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,659
When we had sex?

75
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,203
I was on top and then briefly on bottom.
Human-y style?

76
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,120
Yep, I remember.

77
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,582
Pickles has no idea,
and I've never felt so guilty in my life.

78
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,042
I hate keeping secrets from people.

79
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,294
It's like Rob Schneider's
surprise party all over again.

80
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,004
You cheating on your girlfriend

81
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,799
is not the same
as Rob Schneider's surprise party.

82
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,635
You're right, this is much less sad
and involves more people.

83
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:25,390
-Just tell Pickles the truth.
-Oh, I'm not good at giving bad news.

84
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,725
-Could you do it?
-What? No!

85
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,521
But you're so good at bumming people out.
I'm more of a "good news" guy.

86
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,898
You want your ex-wife to explain the fact

87
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,110
that you cheated <i>with </i>your ex-wife
to your current girlfriend?

88
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,780
Well, of course every idea sounds stupid
if you describe what it is.

89
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,366
You're not the only one
who feels gross about that night.

90
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,411
Do you have any idea how shitty I felt
after you left?

91
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,288
So I made you feel gross, and now...

92
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,624
No, you didn't make me anything!
I am gross.

93
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,502
I feel, all the time, like a garbage fire.

94
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,005
And not a cozy dumpster in a quaint alley,

95
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,717
but a barge, floating out to sea,
with no rudder.

96
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,845
I am a rudderless burning
large garbage barge.

97
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,556
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way
all the time,

98
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,600
but I don't usually,
and now, for the first time ever, I do,

99
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,686
and I don't know what to do
with that feeling!

100
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,397
-Good! You should feel bad!
-Well, I do!

101
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,441
-Great! Me, too!
-Great!

102
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,358
Great!

103
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,864
[both moaning, kissing]

104
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,871
{\an8}So, what, exactly,
do you think happened last night?

105
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,205
Uh...

106
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,833
I don't know. We shot some stuff?

107
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,253
There was an accident on set
and Gina got injured.

108
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,005
{\an8}-Oh, my God, she did?
-She's fine.

109
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,008
{\an8}-But some footage has gotten out.
-Footage?

110
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,801
And because of how it looks,

111
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,388
some people might get the impression
that you were trying to hurt Gina.

112
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,224
-They're gonna get the impression.
-Right.

113
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,268
-But I wasn't.
-Of course not.

114
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,186
What did happen?

115
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,107
So, the two of you are gonna do
a sit-down interview with Biscuits Braxby.

116
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,400
[chuckles] She makes news fun!

117
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,653
Yes. All you need to say is that
you know the footage looks bad,

118
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,155
{\an8}but you and Gina are actors.

119
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,740
{\an8}You performed a convincing scene,

120
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,201
and you can't wait
for everyone to see the new season.

121
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,246
Well, it seems like you've got everything
under control.

122
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,000
[sighs] I'm sorry things got so messy
with the show.

123
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,461
I didn't always look out for you
as much as I should have.

124
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,047
I can take care of myself.
I know you've got a lot on your plate.

125
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,758
It's just been so crazy,
this adoption process,

126
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,553
but I think once I get a baby,
my life will be less hectic, you know?

127
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,138
Oh, sure.

128
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,891
That is why new mothers always
seem so chilled-out and well-rested.

129
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:32,809
Okay, buddy.

130
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,436
Why don't you save your funny jokes
for the interview?

131
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,398
But please don't make jokes
at the interview.

132
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,733
[both sigh]

133
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,820
Sorry I broke every piece
of furniture you own.

134
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,448
-Will 20 dollars cover it?
-Don't worry about it. But, yes.

135
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,367
-So, what happens now?
-I don't know.

136
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,160
-I have to tell Pickles.
-Yeah.

137
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,414
-I'll tell her you and I had a talk.
-Okay.

138
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,541
-And we're getting back together.
-Wait, what?

139
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,584
-But she's a great girl.
-No, no.

140
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,628
But she is a great girl.
You just don't know her.

141
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,004
No, Mr. Peanutbutter.

142
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,424
I don't want to get back together
with you.

143
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,717
-What?
-I think you misunderstood.

144
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,555
-Then why do you keep doing this?
-Why do you keep doing this?

145
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,056
-Because I love you!
-Don't say that.

146
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,183
It's true. I never stopped loving you.

147
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,437
No. We can't do this ever again.

148
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,272
-I'm sorry.
-[sighs]

149
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,358
See? I told you you were great
at giving bad news.

150
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,277
That is not what I wanted to hear.

151
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,616
BoJack, Biscuits. Biscuits, BoJack.

152
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,495
This interview's gonna go down smooth,
like a 1995 Zinfandel.

153
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,457
You ever try one of those '95 zins?
Good year for Zinfandels.

154
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,625
Bad year for Oklahoma federal buildings.

155
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,379
-M'kay.
-Here's how it's gonna go down.

156
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,466
Red light on the camera goes bloop!
I go, "Hey!" You go, "Hey!" I go, "Video?"

157
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,717
You go, "Nah!" I go, "Really?"

158
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,011
You go, "Well..." and you roll me
through the rigamarole.

159
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,971
-Oh, don't--
-Don't forget to plug your show.

160
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,599
Then I go, "Wow. This has been
so illuminating. Thank you so much."

161
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,226
Red light goes boo-de-de-boop,
we'll be out of here before <i>Traffic.</i>

162
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,104
And, yes, I'm talking about
the Stephen Soderbergh movie <i>Traffic.</i>

163
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,107
It's playing on FX tonight,
and I'm hoping to catch it.

164
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,442
Love me some Cheadle.

165
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,945
Am I crazy
or was she kind of hitting on me?

166
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,114
Yeah. You guys have a real flirty energy,

167
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,910
like Matt Lauer and those magazine
cut-outs he now interviews in his kitchen.

168
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,621
-This should be fun.
-Now that's the spirit!

169
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,247
You gotta show me this video.

170
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,957
No, I really don't think
that's necessary.

171
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,460
I'll look like an idiot
if I don't know what I'm talking about.

172
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,545
Just let me see it. How bad could it be?

173
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,174
Cut to: "Ooh, it's really bad!"
But, no, seriously, can I see it?

174
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,717
[sighs]

175
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,553
-[BoJack grunting in video]
-Hey, wow, look at me go.

176
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,680
-[Princess Carolyn's voice] BoJack!
-Oh. Oh!

177
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,724
Oh, look out, I'm getting really, um...

178
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,351
Well, this looks like...

179
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,519
Yeah.

180
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,355
Because I'm actually...

181
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,482
Yeah.

182
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,242
Diane! What have you been up to?
Tell me everything.

183
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,285
Actually, I've been working
on a book of essays--

184
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,995
Okay, I was obviously asking to be polite,

185
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,914
and it's very rude of you
to assume that I care.

186
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,542
I have news that's actually interesting.

187
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:07,213
Girl Croosh is pivoting to video,
and I want you to be <i>the face.</i>

188
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,714
-The face?
-Of the site.

189
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,926
Every woman under 40 will tune in
to hear what you have to say.

190
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,345
And possibly women over 40,
but we have no way of knowing

191
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,389
because they're invisible
to our site metrics.

192
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,932
Stefani... no.

193
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,476
I don't understand.
My parents never said no to me growing up,

194
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,437
so I'm literally incapable
of processing it as a concept.

195
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,692
I'm a hypocrite. I'm miserable
and I make other people miserable.

196
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,112
I don't know what I'm doing.
I can't be a trusted news source,

197
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,448
or an authority,
or a role model for anybody.

198
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,034
Uh, no one called you a "role model."
Settle down.

199
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,161
-Oh. Um...
-You know what your problem is?

200
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,831
You hold everyone
to an impossible standard,

201
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,749
including yourself.

202
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,752
It's super helpful
for writing hot-take shakedowns,

203
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,006
and clickbait take-downs,
but totally toxic for your personal life

204
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,508
and internalized sense
of self-worth, girl.

205
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,677
But shouldn't we be asking
more of ourselves

206
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,806
-and of the people in our lives?
-Of course. But we all fail, Diane.

207
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,058
The world is unforgiving enough as it is.

208
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:05,187
The least we could do is find ways
to forgive each other and ourselves.

209
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,441
Well, then maybe we should be
more forgiving in our content,

210
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,068
and maybe not publish so many take-downs?

211
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,695
Oh, Diane.

212
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,242
- All right, let's bring in the talent.
-[mumbling]

213
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,077
-[gasps]
-Hey, is this a good time to talk?

214
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,623
No, Stuart. This is a very bad time.
We're about to shoot the interview.

215
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,208
Oh, sorry, I haven't memorized
your schedule.

216
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,919
-You could write it down.
-With what, a quill?

217
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,339
-Okay, Elbridge Gerry.
-What?

218
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,883
Anyway, this lady showed up
at the office

219
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,719
and she was being super annoying,
so I brought her here.

220
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,262
-What lady? [gasps]
-Hey.

221
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,182
Why aren't you answering your phone?
Why aren't you in North Carolina?

222
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,975
We're having a bit of a PR crisis.

223
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,895
As soon as this is settled
I will take the first plane there,

224
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,730
but this is just not the best time.

225
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,858
Look, if you can't do this, don't do it.

226
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,111
My mom worked all the time
and she never made time for me.

227
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,072
I felt so alone growing up,

228
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,824
especially because I never knew my dad
or my twin brother

229
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,160
because our parents broke up
when we were babies,

230
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,204
and wouldn't even talk to each other.

231
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,748
Oh, Tracy, I had no idea.

232
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,874
My whole life,

233
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:11,253
all I had was this half of a medallion
with part of a family crest on it.

234
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,173
The crest of a family I'll never know.

235
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,092
-Boring.
-Ex-squeeze me?

236
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,677
Sorry, but your story sucks.

237
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,721
I mean, who wasn't separated
from their family as a baby

238
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,640
and still wears their half of a medallion

239
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:26,143
in the hopes of one day being reunited
with their long-lost twin?

240
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,146
That exact thing happened to me
and you don't see me bitching about it.

241
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,066
-God, get over yourself.
-Get over yourself.

242
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,193
I didn't realize it was a common thing.

243
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,155
Well, obviously it is,
so can you get to your point already?

244
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,826
I was getting to it
if you'd quit talking already.

245
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,830
My point is, not every woman is supposed
to be a mother.

246
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,914
Maybe you'd be happier

247
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,250
if you freed yourself
from that expectation,

248
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,753
and just lived the life
you'd clearly rather be living.

249
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,754
Two minutes to air!

250
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,425
No, that's not... I'm not...
I can't even deal with this right now.

251
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,969
-You need to leave.
-All right, let's go.

252
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,262
She's in one of her moods.

253
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,015
I still think it's pretty nutty
we both have the left half of a medallion.

254
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,392
Like, what are the odds?

255
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,770
Nah, it's a completely different thing
with me. Mine is the right half.

256
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,731
-So...
-Oh, okay.

257
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,318
[exhales]

258
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,697
[clears throat] Hey.

259
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,159
-Hello, BoJack.
-Are you okay? You look good.

260
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,702
Yeah, makeup covered the bruises.

261
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,288
-Gina, I'm so sorry.
-Let's just do the interview, okay?

262
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,415
-I'm gonna come clean about everything.
-What?

263
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,916
Everyone needs to know what I did.

264
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,835
-[bell rings]
-[man] Please get in positions.

265
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,794
No. Don't do that.

266
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,964
Gina, what I did to you--
I saw the video and it looked pretty bad.

267
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,299
I'll say it was pretty bad.

268
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,633
-It was assault.
-Yeah.

269
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,135
You physically overpowered me,

270
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:44,096
and if there were any justice,
you would be in jail right now.

271
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,014
Okay, so...

272
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:45,931
But my career,

273
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,268
after so many failed attempts,
is finally starting to take off.

274
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,687
I am getting offers, and fan mail,

275
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,440
and magazine columns
about what a good actor I am.

276
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,692
People know me because of my acting.

277
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,528
And all that goes away if I'm just

278
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,405
the girl who got choked
by BoJack Horseman.

279
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,448
I can't lie about this.

280
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:06,118
I don't want you to be the most notable
thing that ever happened to me.

281
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,621
I don't want you to be the question
I get asked in interviews

282
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,705
for the rest of my life.

283
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,291
-Gina, I--
-You need to do this for me, okay?

284
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,834
Because I just want this to be over.

285
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,128
Can we talk about it,
maybe after the interview?

286
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,048
No. I will be civil to you on set
when we have scenes together,

287
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,176
but otherwise, I never wanna think
about you again.

288
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,346
-Hey, guys, how are we doing?
-So good, Biscuits.

289
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,890
We're so excited to be here,
aren't we, BoJack?

290
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,059
-Um, yeah.
-[buzzer blares]

291
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,687
I'm here with BoJack Horseman
and Gina Cazador,

292
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,023
stars of the hit show <i>Philbert.</i>

293
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,275
Let's cut to the chase. That video.

294
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,320
[chuckles] Oh, my God,
it's so embarrassing.

295
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,075
-This is all a misunderstanding.
-I mean, it's kind of hilarious.

296
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,160
We've actually been laughing
about it here on set!

297
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,120
[both chuckling]

298
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,207
Really?
BoJack looks so angry in the video.

299
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,376
And Gina, you look terrified.

300
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,753
Biscuits, we're actors. It's what we do.

301
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,339
-Oh, thank God.
-Yep, actors.

302
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,759
Okay, I gotta ask.
Is the story true? Are you two an item?

303
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,302
[laughs] Busted!

304
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,638
Oh, boy.
Looks like you got your scoop!

305
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,139
Can you give us a kiss?

306
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,516
-Uh...
-Sure thing.

307
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,101
[kisses]

308
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:16,105
-What's it like dating your co-star?
-It's so great.

309
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,816
I'll bet sometimes, though,
you wanna strangle each other, right?

310
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,817
Oh, you bet!

311
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,403
-[BoJack chuckles]
-[Gina growling]

312
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,407
Okay, you two.
This has been illuminating.

313
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,742
-Thank you so much.
-[bell rings]

314
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,328
-[man] That's a cut!
-That was amazing.

315
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,246
[Gina] Mm-hmm.

316
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,623
[sighs]

317
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,754
You wanted to see me, Mr. Fondle?

318
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,592
[Henry] <i>I must make love to you.</i>

319
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,429
[chuckles] You mean to my brain,
because I have such good ideas.

320
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,223
Thanks for the encouragement.
I never got that at my last job.

321
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,516
[Henry] <i>Nice boobs.</i>

322
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,059
That's exactly right.

323
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,937
Those guys were nice,
but they were total boobs.

324
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,231
Anyway, I'm gonna go review
the third quarter budget

325
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,399
with our diagnostics team.

326
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,277
-[Henry] <i>Insufficient power.</i>
<i>-</i>To review the budget?

327
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,154
-[panel beeping]
-[Henry] <i>Insufficient power.</i>

328
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,574
Are you saying I don't have the authority
to do my job?

329
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,409
[Henry] <i>Now entering sleep mode.</i>

330
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,952
You wanna sleep with me?

331
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,622
That is not a mode
I'm comfortable with, Mr. Fondle.

332
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,665
[Henry] <i>Please connect to power source!</i>

333
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,583
[gasps]

334
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,878
So first, he said
I had insufficient power...

335
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,795
Wow.

336
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,714
Which I have never heard him say
to a man.

337
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,592
And then he asked me to "connect"
to his "power source."

338
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,929
Did you feel physically threatened?
Was there any implication of assault?

339
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,557
Not assault, but he did make a mention
of "low battery".

340
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,810
It is never acceptable to threaten
an employee with battery at any level.

341
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,896
{\an8}What time is it right now?

342
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,523
{\an8}For female employees
of one popular website,

343
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,318
the answer is Sexual Harassment O'Clock!

344
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,488
What started with the allegations
of one junior executive

345
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,741
has quickly snowballed
into an avalanche of accusation,

346
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,077
as women at every level have come forward

347
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,996
with their own harrowing stories
of what happens

348
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,083
when the big hand
meets the little hand.

349
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:04,213
He said he wanted to "...get all up
in my guts with his penis

350
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,048
and ejaculate inside me."

351
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,884
At the time, I just thought
it was typical corporate banter,

352
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,096
but now I'm like, uh...

353
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,597
{\an8}Look, obviously,

354
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,518
{\an8}men should not be engaging
in predatory behavior at the office,

355
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:21,188
{\an8}but I'm worried now the pendulum's
gonna swing too far in the other extreme

356
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,566
{\an8}where they'll be held accountable
for that behavior, and that's not ideal.

357
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,861
Uh, Henry Fondle is a sex robot,

358
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,782
and he should not be a CEO
of any company.

359
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,494
[reporter] When you say "sex robot,"
you're speaking metaphorically, right?

360
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,579
No.

361
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:42,042
{\an8}The board has taken decisive action
to remove Henry Fondle

362
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,503
{\an8}by placing him
on an indefinite paid leave.

363
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:48,382
Meanwhile, we will be scaling back,
canceling our slate of streaming series

364
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,969
and refocusing on our original mission
of being a website you can go to

365
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,014
{\an8}if you don't know what time it is,
that also doesn't harass anyone.

366
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,474
{\an8}This is a great day for the women
of this company,

367
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,476
{\an8}many of whom will be laid off.

368
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,645
{\an8}-[reporters clamoring]
-[camera shutter clicking]

369
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,566
So, you got a call from your dentist;
no cavities.

370
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,694
Emily Van Camp wants to move
your four o'clock to five.

371
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:13,073
And also, Todd wanted me to let you know
that the network folded,

372
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,909
everyone got fired...
[yawns] And your show is canceled.

373
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,370
-What?
-It's over. It's all over.

374
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,622
What are you talking about?
It's not over.

375
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,833
We just have to find our baby
another home.

376
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,793
Maybe What Time Is It Right Now is gone,

377
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,129
but there are like a billion
other websites, right?

378
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,257
What about that website you go to,
to pay your parking tickets?

379
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,093
Or if we're really desperate, TNT?

380
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,013
The point is we're just getting started,
Princess Carolyn!

381
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,015
-[door grinds]
-Princess Carolyn?

382
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,225
-[phone rings]
-She's gone.

383
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,769
Unless...

384
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,481
I was Princess Carolyn the whole time.

385
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,734
Mm.

386
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,986
[in female voice] Oh, fish!

387
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,742
Well, this is it, Henry Fondle.
The end of the line.

388
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,993
[man] Hiya, hotshot.

389
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,622
I've been following your career
pretty closely and I like what I see.

390
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:05,084
How'd you like a corner office
at Disney-Fox-AT&amp;T-AOL-

391
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,879
Time-Warner- Pepsico-Viacom-Halliburton-
Skynet-Toyota-Trader-Joe's?

392
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,089
[Henry] <i>Give it to me!</i>

393
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:14,343
Uh, you know this guy just got fired
for sexual harassment, right?

394
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,055
Yeah, so he's learned his lesson
and he's ready to reenter the workforce.

395
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,057
[Henry] <i>I have many penises.</i>

396
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,726
[chuckles] You said it, buddy.
Give us a call.

397
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,482
Do you wanna take a ride?
There's something I wanna show you.

398
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,609
[Henry] <i>Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

399
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,946
[knocking on door]

400
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,491
Oh, hello.

401
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,327
Shouldn't you be out
"not really strangling" someone?

402
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,662
The last time I saw you,

403
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,248
you said you still believed
I could be a better person.

404
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,542
-Do you still believe that?
-I do.

405
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,585
I need you to write one
of your take-downs.

406
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,628
-About me.
-What?

407
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,631
You can't write anything
about Gina, but... the other stuff.

408
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,091
Everything. I need to get it out.

409
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:58,929
No. I'm done writing about you,
or for you, or with you.

410
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,556
Diane, please, I need this.

411
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,558
I'm a bad guy
and the world needs to know.

412
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,311
There's no such thing as "bad guys"
or "good guys."

413
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,896
We're all just... guys...

414
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,567
who do good stuff sometimes
and bad stuff sometimes.

415
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,779
And all we can do is try to do
less bad stuff and more good stuff,

416
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,283
but you're never going to be good.
Because you're not bad.

417
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,618
So, you need to stop using that
as an excuse.

418
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,787
I am asking to be held accountable.

419
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,956
And I'm telling you it's not gonna happen.

420
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,002
Whatever you put in that story,
no one is gonna "hold you accountable."

421
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,171
You need to take responsibility
for yourself.

422
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,797
I don't know how to do that!

423
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:34,715
[Diane sighs]

424
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,508
[BoJack grunting]

425
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,927
[sighs]

426
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,890
This is it. My special thinking spot.

427
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,226
[Henry] <i>Let us put on</i>
<i>a Lionel Richie album,</i>

428
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,478
<i>and finger each other's holes.</i>

429
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,566
Shh. Henry, no.
There'll be time for that later.

430
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,402
[Henry] <i>I love it</i>
<i>when you call me Father.</i>

431
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,320
That's right.

00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,072
-[Henry] <i>I... I...</i>

00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:09,082
Shh. It's okay. It's over now.
It's all over. [pants]

435
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,043
Oh, man.

436
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:14,838
[grunts]

437
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,006
Okay.

438
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,094
[Princess Carolyn chuckles] Aw.

439
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,931
She's beautiful.
What are you gonna call her?

440
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,558
Untitled Princess Carolyn Project.

441
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,144
But not really, though, right?

442
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,734
Hey, do you think my cactus is gonna be
okay if I'm not there for six weeks?

443
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,612
Yeah, I think
your cactus is gonna be okay.

444
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,115
-Is this a mistake?
-No.

445
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,122
Wow, it feels so weird to be eating here.

446
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,291
So, this is what it's like
from the other side.

447
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,960
Pickles, I took you here

448
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,754
because I wanted you to be somewhere
you felt comfortable.

449
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,965
Aw, that's so sweet, Mister.

450
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,634
Because I need to talk to you
about something.

451
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,428
Oh, no, this is really bad.
Why would you do this to me?

452
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,763
I didn't tell you what it is.

453
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,307
No one ever "needs to talk"
about something good!

454
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,685
No one ever says,
"I need to talk to you: Happy Birthday"

455
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,354
or, "I need to talk to you:
Felicity Jones hired a new stylist

456
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,690
and her red carpet looks this season
are to die for!"

457
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,859
Well, good news first:
Felicity Jones did hire a new stylist,

458
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,988
but sadly,
her fashion choices just aren't popping.

459
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,908
Oh, no! This is bad news!
Well, thank you for telling me.

460
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,827
That isn't the thing
I was going to tell you.

461
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,995
There's more bad news?

462
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,914
Is it worse or not as bad
as the Felicity Jones thing?

463
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,000
Well, it's different...

464
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,877
Whatever it is,
we're going to get through it together.

465
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:40,424
Whatever it is, I love you,
and nothing's going to change that.

466
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,927
Nothing you say is going to make me
stop loving you, no matter what.

467
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,929
Pickles... I...

468
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,723
What is it?

469
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,351
-[grunts] Will you marry me?
-[squeals]

470
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,692
What do I say... when I go in?

471
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:03,488
You say, "Hello. I am BoJack.
Horseman, obviously.

472
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,407
You've probably heard of me.
I'm very famous.

473
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,784
So... Sober me up, please!"

474
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,661
What if I get sober...

475
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,914
and I'm still the same awful person
I've always been,

476
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,708
only more... sober?

477
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,377
I think that is a very real possibility.

478
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,004
-Don't be shitty.
-I'm not.

479
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,466
Rehab is not a cure-all that's gonna
suddenly make you not an asshole.

480
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,843
Then why are we doing this?
Let's turn around and go home.

481
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,219
-You wanna go home?
-Is that okay?

482
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,804
Look, you have two options.

483
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,098
You can go back home
and try to do things your way,

484
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,767
like you've been doing all your life,

485
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,561
or you can see what these guys
have to offer.

486
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,566
I don't understand
why you're being so nice to me.

487
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,486
After everything you know about me,
all the shit I put you through.

488
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,990
When I was in high school,
I had this friend. Abby.

489
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,910
She was my only friend
and we did everything together,

490
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,872
until she got adopted by the cool kids
and then she turned on me...

491
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,290
so fast.

492
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,835
She used every secret she knew about me,
every vulnerability.

493
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,172
She made me miserable
my entire sophomore year.

494
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:06,843
But then that summer
when her mom got sick, like really sick,

495
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,305
and all her cool friends were off
vacationing in Martha's Vineyard,

496
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,849
-I was there for her.
-Why?

497
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:17,229
Because I'm an idiot. And it was Abby.

498
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,899
And I hated her,
and I will never forgive her,

499
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:25,237
but she needed me and...
she was my best friend and I loved her.

500
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:30,617
And now... you're here, and I hate you,

501
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,871
but you're my best friend,
and you need me.

502
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,957
[inhales, exhales]

503
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,710
You know what you're gonna say?
You wanna practice?

504
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,506
I'm gonna say,
"Hello. I am BoJack Horseman.

505
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,341
Obviously, you know who I am,

506
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,428
because I'm very famous,
and also we called ahead.

507
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,723
And I am here because... I need help."

508
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,356
[chuckles]

509
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,826
[door opens, closes]

510
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,543
[car door closes]

511
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,253
[sighs]

512
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,160
[music playing]
