I heard before he played triangle
he was in a prison gang.

00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,578
I heard he was a tech millionaire.

12
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,080
[in French accent] There is a rumor
he is a foreign prince.

-His name is Todd Chavez.

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,795
And he's the most giving man
the world has ever known.

00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,716
He saved my pregnant daughter
from drowning in a shipwreck,

00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,484
<i>They had a spirited</i>

22
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,321
<i>and by the end my daughter decided</i>
<i>that since we are of Jewish heritage,</i>

23
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,991
the boy might like to have the option
to become religious if he so chooses.

24
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,826
Sounds like he really helped your daughter

that was right for her family.

died of starvation

after getting his foot stuck
in his triangle,

28
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,086
Todd Chavez took over
because we needed him.

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,422
-What a guy!
-He is always helping others.

30
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,092
You know, sometimes
when that triangle part is coming up,

31
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,428
I find myself hoping he won't show up.

32
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,223
No man should be asked
to give that much.

00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,767
-He is truly the best of all of--
-Whoa!

34
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,188
Oh, hey, guys. I was eating a taco earlier
and I got salsa on my shirt.

35
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,483
I went to clean it off, but then when
I put my hands in the automatic dryer

36
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,610
I forgot I was still holding the taco.

37
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,153
I got my hands all greasy,

38
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,823
so I couldn't open the doorknob
for an hour.

39
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,117

{\an8}Meanwhile, all this talk
of whatever it is you're talking about

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,810
{\an8}-is making me hungry.
-Mmm?

{\an8}Cheese? Yes, please!

47
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,315
{\an8}Todd, don't distract Mr. Peanutbutter
with your weird pocket cheeses.

48
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,818
{\an8}The issue is fracking and the people
really want to know your opinion.

49
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,737
Well, then, color me "the people"

50
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,697
because I would also like
to know my opinion.

51
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,491
{\an8}You don't have one yet.
The polling research comes in today

52
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,578
{\an8}and that will decide whether
you're for or against fracking.

53
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,747
{\an8}Here's a thought:
maybe be against fracking.

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,206
{\an8}-It's terrible!
-Diane.

55
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,417
Just my opinion.
You don't tell me how to do my job.

56
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,004
{\an8}Also, fracking is the worst. I can't 
believe you'd even consider endorsing it.

57

Gotta get to work. Love you!

-But seriously, seriously,

{\an8}if you come out in support of fracking
I'm gonna be super upset. Bye!

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,181
{\an8}Where you stand on the issue
doesn't really matter.

61
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,392
What's important is that
you seem sincere and emphatic.

62
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,854
Ohh. Are you a fan of charming
but inessential Will Smith movies?

63
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,815
Because, slight <i>Hitch,</i>
I always show I'm empathic

by taking off my glasses dramatically,
but I kinda lost them.

to a starving shipwrecked person.

[sighs] When did you last see the glasses?

67
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,826
I was in a meeting with Princess Carolyn.

68
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,787
She was saying
I'm always forgetting stuff,

69
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,539
so I whipped off my glasses,
looked her square in the eye and said,

70
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,667
"I never forget a thing."

71
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,126
I might have left my glasses there.

72
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,503
{\an8}Todd, you never do anything.

73
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,797
{\an8}Why don't you take the campaign bus
over to VIM

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,132
{\an8}and get Mr. Peanutbutter's glasses?
Can you handle that?

75
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,134
{\an8}I never know if I can handle anything.

That's how I ended up with the cremains
of Cornelius Vanderbilt.

[grunts] I don't have time for this!

-It's me!

00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,667
You are just the guy I need.
You know the actress Courtney Portnoy?

86
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,088
I think so. She portrayed the formerly 
portly consort in <i>The Seaport Resort</i>?

87
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,340
Courtly roles like
the formerly portly consort

88
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,135
are Courtney Portnoy's forte,
but she's got a new action movie

89
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,721
that's supposed to change her image:
<i>Ms. Taken.</i>

90
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,639
You know Mr. Taken
from the <i>Taken </i>movies?

91
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,308
-This is his niece.
-Nice!

92
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,311
This was supposed to be Courtney's 
crossover coronation.

93
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,563
But that's sort of been thwarted, 
unfortunately,

94
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,356
'cause Courtney's
purportedly falling short

95
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,150
of shoring up four-quadrant support.

96
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,027
Makes perfect sense so far.

97
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,195
The public sees her as out of touch.

98
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,574
We need to make her seem relatable,
and the best way to do that

99
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,453
is to be seen dating a down-to-earth
boring nobody like yourself.

100
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,496
You can do that, right?
You're not doing anything.

101
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,416
I'm kind of busy today.
I gotta pick up these glasses,

102
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,419
and then tonight there was this meeting
I wanted to go to.

103
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,464
This will take no time, I promise.
Meet her for lunch.

104
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,924
The paparazzi will show up,
pop some razzis.

105
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,011
I do love getting my picture taken.
It's proof I exist.

106
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,305
Marvelous!
Judah, prepare the press release.

109
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,564
Well, we didn't get the polling research

-Here you go.
-Thank you.

111
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,527

someone wouldn't sign for it.

Ooh.

to sign Mr. Peanutbutter's name,

-just sign it.
-You got it, chief.

All right, Middle-Aged Yeller,
here's what you're gonna do.

00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,665
You're gonna give
an impassioned speech on fracking

117
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,919
that doesn't actually take a stand
either way on fracking.

Okay.

and I want you all to know,
right here and right now,

123
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,892
I am taking a stand.

-I am on... your side!

-What side is that, specifically?
-Good question.

I am specifically
on the side of the facts,

127

be willing to sign this letter
to our state government?

131
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,039
Yes. I'll write his name on anything.

-I know, it's confusing.

00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,865
-I have eight dads.
-How'd that happen? Test tubes?

146
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,367
-No. I was adopted.
-Oh, of course.

147

By eight men in a committed gay
polyamorous relationship.

148
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,623
-Less of course.
-But ever since I was a baby,

149
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,877
people always said I looked like
BoJack Horseman.

150
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,421
-That's a terrible thing to say to a baby!
-[skimmer clatters]

151
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:48,509
And I've always wondered if BoJack
could be my biological... sperm guy.

152
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,720
I guess it's possible.

153
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,223
BoJack used to say his penis
is like sun-dried tomatoes:

154
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,560
back in the '90s it got into everything.

155
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,729
I came to L.A.
to get to the bottom of things.

156
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,690
I even bought a deluxe spy kit.
Sorry about knocking you out.

157
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,109
Once you have chloroform,
you can't <i>not</i> use it.

158
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,778
No, I get it. BoJack had one
of those spy kits, too.

159
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,698
He mostly just used the chloroform
on himself, though.

160
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,159
I read in his book that you live together.

161
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,287
-Can you help me find him?
-Sorry. I don't live there anymore.

162
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,789
And no one knows where he's been
for the last year.

00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,625
I guess I don't have to meet him.

164
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,378
All I need is a DNA sample,
like a piece of hair or something.

165
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,839
-I guess his house might have-- [gasps]
-[grunts]

166
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,593
-Whoa!
-Sorry again. It's just so fun.

167
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,596
Okay, there might be some hairs
in the shower drain,

168
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,806
but hard to know who they belong to.

169
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,728
Everyone who has sex with BoJack
usually takes a <i>long </i>shower afterwards.

170
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,397
-Hey, I think I see a hair.
-[moaning]

171
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,399
Oh, no, BoJack.

172
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,568
-Yoink!
-What the... was...

173
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,488
-[exhales] Okay.
-Okay, let's blow.

174
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,324
Blow? Who's got blow?
Save some for BoJack. [groans] Huh?

175
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,661
Wait, Todd? Oh, shit. Are you gonna
yell at me? Can I have the blow first?

176
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:00,665
No. BoJack, there's no blow, okay?
And I'm not going to yell at you.

177
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,666
And what is this?

178
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,544
I'm Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-

182
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,720
That was a joke. Obviously, I've never
heard of your family and/or law firm.

183
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,891
That was also a joke. Todd, who is
this tough crowd you brought to my home?

-Um, BoJack, this is your daught...
-Mm-mmm, mm-mmm!

185
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,647
...dot-dot maid.

186
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,190
Way to build up the suspense.

187
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,776
To, uh, tidy up the place
in case you came back.

188
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,486
You got me a maid? Thank you.

189
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,488
Here I thought Channing Tatum
was a good neighbor

190
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,198
for picking up my mail while I was gone,

191
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,617
but you, and after all the things
I did to you,

192
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,371
-I don't know how to tell you--
-BoJack, we haven't talked in like a year,

193
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,665
and that's actually been
kind of working for me.

194
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,669
So, maybe it's better if we just
keep things like that, you know?

195
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,589
-Oh. Okay. So then why did you hire me--
-[grunts]

196
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,340
Oh, yeah, deliver me.

197
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,468
You're welcome.
Now go get that DNA tested.

198
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,513
[panting]

199
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,181
Can you tell me if this is a match?

200
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,934
-A match with who?
-Hollyhock.

201
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:07,648

202
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,192
Whatever those words are,
I need a sample from her, too.

203
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,069

Bring it in an hour.
I gotta get to lunch.

205
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,490
Nothing like working
with hair, blood, and semen all day

206
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,868
to work up an appetite,
and it's already 1:00.

207
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,579

I gotta go meet my fake girlfriend!

208
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,456
Oh, you have a fake girlfriend too?

209
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,208
Mine is a bunch of water balloons
with a blonde wig.

210
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,630
I suppose a fancy restaurant like this

211
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,132
is too fancy for a common man
such as yourself.

212
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,175
No, it's fine.

213
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,178
You'd probably like to take me
someplace rough and primitive.

214
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,805
Uh... do you want me to take you
somewhere else?

215
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:44,226
Well, if you must drag me on some
barbaric adventure, I can't stop you.

216
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,729
There's a Pony Roma's
at Universal CityWalk.

217
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,898
A chain restaurant?
Oh, God, no, I'll be mugged.

218
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,107
I can't do this.

219
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,860
Todd, I can never be
your dirty peasant girl, I'm sorry.

-Did you clean anything?
-No.

230
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,225
But I am learning so much
about my possibly-maybe birth father.

231
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,186
Like, did you know he has a shoebox
in his closet full of bad reviews

232
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,896
for other people's TV shows?

233
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,191
So all you've done so far
is snoop around?

234
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:36,320
I also ate a box of donuts,
got sleepy and took a nap.

235
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,697
Yeah, I'm not sure we really need
to do this DNA test.

236
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,491
Look, I didn't come all this way

237
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,035
to not find out
who my biological father is.

238
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,664
Okay, fine, then I just need you
to yank out a strand of hair

239
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,418
-so I can take it down to the lab.
-No way! That sounds painful.

240
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,420
-Can't we just use your hair?
-Um...

241
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,629
-No.
-[panting]

242
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:57,716
No, but I can pull out some of my hair
at the same time,

243
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,719
-so you don't have to do it alone.
-Okay, that sounds fair.

244
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,929
On three, we pull.

245
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,557
-One... two... three!
-Ow!

246
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,269
Oh, wait, I have this whole comb
full of hair in my bag.

I passed out again for some reason.

250
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,236
When I woke up, the house
was messier than when she started.

251
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,280
I don't mind someone else
in the house with me,

252
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,116
in case I start choking on pills
or have a funny take on current events

253
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,161
that demands an audience, but if she
can't do her job, I gotta fire her.

254
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,122
You can't do that!
Here, buzz up real nice,

255
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:32,084
take a nap, and while you're sleeping,
I'll get the maid to clean

256
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,462

and who owned at the VMAs?

323
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,265
When I need Mr. Peanutbutter
to take his heartworm pills,

324
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,851
I always hide it in cheese
so he doesn't know

325
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,686
he's doing something he hates.

326
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,440
What if you take your important stuff
and hide it in some juicy gossip?

327
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,317
That's actually a really good idea.

328
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,029
But... [groans] I don't know any gossip
and I wouldn't even know where to look.

329
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,364
The Internet?

330
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,617
No! Look at me!

331
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,954
Because I have potentially 
earth-shattering inside info!

332
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,998
That beloved famous person, uh...

333
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,293
Channing Tatum may have
an illegitimate daughter

334
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,755
that's also a Cordovian refugee.

335
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,341
-Are you serious?
-I have these two hairs.

336
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,135
One is from Channing,
the other is from a baby.

337
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,597
If the DNA lab confirms a match,
you have your story.

338
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,391
Thanks, Todd. I owe you one.

339
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,769
Okay, but if it's a match,
please call me first.

340
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,689
'Cause, uh-- 'cause I love juicy gossip.

341
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,649
[ringing]

342
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,069
Where am I supposed to go?
Okay.

343
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,821

349
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,167
Uh... okay.

He's so normal.

352
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,550
Uh... hmm... uh...

353
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,261
Where's the hollow look of someone
forced to starve themselves

354
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,514
to fit our unrealistic expectation
of what beauty should be?

355
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,474
[Tim Gunn] He is not making it work.

356
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,352
-No! Wait!
-Huh?

357
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,522
Isn't fashion supposed to be for everyone?

358
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,899
That behatted boy is right.

359
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,528
Fashion was never meant to be
an inherently elitist form.

360
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,073
We need to return fashion
to its utilitarian roots.

361
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,575
Give it back to the people!

362
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,244
-[Gunn] Bravo! He <i>is </i>making it work.

Leave a message at the Todd.

365
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,542
The DNA matched!

366
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,961
Looks like a wide variety of screen roles

367
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,672
isn't the only thing
Channing brought life to.

368
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:33,052
It's a match?
I gotta tell Holly... woo agents

369
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,513
to keep their eyes peeled
for a refugee baby

370
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,141
with abs to die for.
[sighs]

371
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,852
Nick, tell Janae to stock the warehouse
with red hoodies.

372
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,272
-This is the look of the future.
-Couch-surfer couture!

373
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,649
[ringing]

374
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,653
Where's Hollyhock?
I need to talk to her.

375
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,989
-She's in maid heaven.
-She's dead?!

376
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,951
Sorry, I meant she belongs in maid heaven
because she is a cleaning angel.

377
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,079
-Where is she?
-I sent her to Channing Tatum's house

378
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,623
to pay him back for collecting my mail
while I was out of town.

379
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,708
Looks like I missed quite a deal
at Pottery Barn.

380
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,587
Life is but an endless series
of missed opportunities,

381
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,047
some involving Pottery Barn.

382
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,632
Okay, I'm gonna--

383
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,176
Can you believe this?
Mr. Peanutbutter's running for governor.

384
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,888
I can believe it, because I've been around
for the last year.

385
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,516
Right. How's Diane feel about that?

386
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,143
You could ask her yourself.
Does she even know you're back?

387
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,938
I wanted to call her,
but I'm just not ready.

388
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,815
Nobody knows I'm back except you.

389
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,067
And Channing Tatum, and my pills guy,

390
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,319
and my booze guy,
my weed guy, my coke guy,

391
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,239
some smartass at Pizza Hut
who deserved an in-person finger-wagging,

392
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,700
-and my maid.
-And now she's at Channing Tatum's house?

393
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,953
I came back because
I wanted to fix things,

394
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,330
-but now I don't know if I can.
-Uh-huh.

395
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,999
I've been so lucky to have people
in my life who care about me.

396
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,376
I don't deserve any of them.

397
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,628
I definitely don't deserve
to have a friend as amazing

398
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,089
and generous and forgiving
and thoughtful as...

399
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,841
-Yeah? Oh.
-Channing Tatum.

400
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,009
I'm only gonna hurt him
like I've hurt everyone else.

401
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,929
I was a fool to think I could just
jump back into a new relationship.

402
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,890
Can you go over to Channing Tatum's house,
tell him I won't be his friend?

403
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,893
I can't break another heart.
Not today, not Channing.

404
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,270
Okay.

405
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,522
[panting]

406
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,026
-Hollyhock, I need to tell you something.
-Did you get the results?

407
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,988
'Cause I'm really looking forward
to dropping this whole maid thing,

408
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,739
even though I'm kind of nailing it.

409
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,868
Are you sure you want to know?
I don't know if BoJack is ready

410
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,079
for a normal relationship with anyone.

411
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,289
Oh.

412
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,916
Well, that's fine.
I don't want a relationship.

413
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,418
I already have eight dads.

414
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,546
It's not like a ninth dad is what I need
to suddenly fill a hole in my life

415
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,299
that the unconditional love of eight dads
couldn't already fill.

416
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,633
Well, then good news.

417
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,887
I got the results and...

418
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,096
it's not a match.

419
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,224
-Oh. Really?
-Yeah. Good news, right?

420
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,934
I shouldn't have come here.

421
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,437
Papa Steve told me this was a bad idea.

422
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,689
But Papa Greg said, "Follow your heart."

423
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,108
Then Papa Dashawn said,
"I agree with Greg."

424
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,611
Daddy Quackers said,
"Let's put it to a vote, quack-quack."

425
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,528
[knock on door]

426
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,323
-[Diane] Hello? Anybody home?
-Get down! Go, go, go! Shh.

427
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,241
[Diane] I can hear someone in there.
<span style="style_3"/>Channing?

Uh, it's me... [deep breath]
Channing Tatum.

430
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,833
I'm in the middle of, uh,
channing right now,

431
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,003
but you can come back... tatum?

432
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,088
Listen, I'm a reporter.

433
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,133
I tested your DNA
against another sample's DNA,

434
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,927
and apparently the two are related.

435
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,137
-You're a father.
-Wait, what?

436
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,306
-Okay. Thanks!
-Todd.

437
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,517
I was going to write a story
and drag your name through the mud

438
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,396
just because I thought a couple more
people would click on an article I wrote.

439
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,025
But I don't think that's
the kind of journalist I want to be.

440
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,986
Maybe I'm not cut out
for this line of work.

441
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,279
Sorry to bother you.

442
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,822
Uh... [deep breath]

443
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,743
[in lower voice] Hey, I obviously don't
know you because I am Channing Tatum,

444
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,496
the guy from <i>Green Lantern</i>
or whatever,

445
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,457
and you are a nobody,
but you came all the way over here

446
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,085
to warn me about something
you hadn't even written yet.

447
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,712
You ask me, movie star Channing Tatum,

448
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:59,591
I'd say you're exactly the kind
of journalist we need in this world.

449
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,759
Wow!

450
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:04,346
That doesn't sound at all
like Channing Tatum's voice,

451
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,642
but that <i>is </i>the kind of thing I would want
Channing Tatum to say to me,

452
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,602
so thanks, Channing.

453
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,853
Love half your movies!

454
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,648
[sighs] That was a close one,
huh, Hollyhock?

00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,526
-Hollyhock?

456
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,444

457
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,364
So, I see lots of pictures of you
at the fashion show,

458
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,325
-but none of you with Courtney.
-Oh, crap!

459
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,494
[grunting, panting]

460
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,870
-Hi.
-Oh, hello.

461
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,914
Uh, why are you wearing my clothes?

462
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:35,419
These aren't anything like your clothes.
This hat alone cost $50,000.

463
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:39,506
Oh. So, uh...
what's it like being a movie star?

464
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,049
It's awfully trying.

465
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,635
Do you ever feel like
everyone's looking at you

466
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,014
-but nobody sees you?
-Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

467
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,350
No, I was speaking rhetorically
about a feeling that only movie stars get.

468
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,393
Ohh.

469
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,812
-Okay.
-But it feels good to talk about it.

470
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,981
Yeah. Talking's good.

471
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,192
You know, there was a meeting
I was supposed to go to tonight,

472
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,070
but I don't think I'm gonna go.
I don't know if I'm ready.

473
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,071
Ready for what?

474
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,991
What if it's not everything
I want it to be?

475
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,995
Sometimes the idea of something
is better than the truth, you know?

476
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,956
I always prefer fiction to truth, 
personally.

477
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,541
I've staked my career on it.
[chuckles]

478
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,376
Yeah, that makes sense.

479
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,295
-Ha hah!
-Smile for the birdie.

480
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,881
Hey, Courtney, you canoodling
with a supermodel now?

481
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,507
-That's right.
-Fancy.

482
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,843
I love how not down-to-earth
you are together.

483
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,929
This is going to really make headlines
when you two break up.

484
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,433
Here's an even bigger headline:
we shan't be breaking up.

485
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,602
-We're engaged!
-Wowee!

486
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,563
Hooray! I'm confused!

487
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,901
Hollyhock? Are you here?

488
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,528
No, but BoJack, who lives here, is here.

489
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,323
BoJack, I gotta tell you, um...

490
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,534
-Hollyhock is your daughter.
-What do you mean?

491
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,286
-She's your daughter.
-I don't understand.

492
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,789
She has Horseman DNA.
You're her father.

493
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,040
That's impossible. I'm BoJack.

494
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:59,377
She didn't want me to tell you,
but I thought you should know.

495
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,672
I guess I don't blame her.
I wouldn't want to be my daughter either.

496
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,590
BoJack...

497
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,759
Look what I do to people
I'm supposed to care about.

498
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,845
I had sex with the one person
I've ever seen you be in love with.

499
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,973
I guess they're not gonna put you
in the best friends hall of fame,

500
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,434
but I don't know that I loved her.

501
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,269
I don't think I'm allowed to be in love.

502
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,688
Don't say that.
You do so much for everybody.

503
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,649
All you ever asked for
was a roof over your head

504
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,317
and the occasional s'more in a baguette.

505
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,861
I'm telling you,
it's a million-dollar idea.

506
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,655
I got more of you than I ever deserved.

507
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,865
If you never talk to me again
I just want you to know

508
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,952
that I appreciate it,
and I appreciate you.

509
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,495
-Thanks.

510
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,249
It was shitty
what you did with Emily, but, um...

511
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:41,837
I think I'm... asexual.

512
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,464
A sexual what? Dynamo, deviant?

513
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,216
Harassment lawsuit waiting to happen?

514
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,678
No. Asexual, not sexual.

515
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,679
Ohh.

516
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,141
-I'm sure you think that's weird.
-Are you kidding? That's amazing.

517
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,143
Sometimes I wish I was asexual.

518
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,270
Maybe then I wouldn't have
<i>a </i>strain of herpes.

519
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,980
-You have multiple strains--
-I know.

520
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,356
The joke only works with the "a".

521
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,985
It actually feels nice
to finally say it out loud.

522
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,362
I am an asexual person.

523
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,282
-I am asexual.
-That's great.

524
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,701
So if you're not mad about Emily--

525
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,579
It wasn't just Emily, BoJack,

526
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,707
and I don't know if I'm ready for us
to be friends again yet.

527
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,877
-Oh. Okay.
-But we can be more than not-friends.

528
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,336
You know, for an asexual,

529
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,381
more than not-friends is probably
as good as it gets, right?

530
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,967
I'm not really at a place yet
where I want to joke about it.

531
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,429
-Got it, got it, totally.
-But it feels good to talk about it.

532
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,723
Well, if you ever need a place to crash,
that couch--

533
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,558
-I'm gonna go.
-Oh.

534
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,852
-Right now?
-Welcome back, BoJack.

535
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,687
It's good to see you.

536
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,316
Uh...

537
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,609
Hmm.
