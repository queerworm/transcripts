-[gasps] Uh... you do?

162
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,340
You're taking the character home with you.
It happens to every actor.

163
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,509
I played a girls' PE coach
who solved mysteries

164
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,261
in a pilot called,
<i>Death, She Whistles.</i>

165
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,472
It never went to series,
but I got so into it,

166
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,765
I spent months ordering
every mouthy teen I saw

167
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,685
-to drop and give me 20.
-Yeah, you're probably right.

Is everyone having a good time?

00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,815
-Uh...
-[music stops]

181
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,402
Okay, I'm gonna level with you.
I'm in a real situation here

182
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,073
because I did not realize I was supposed
to sell ads for this show.

183
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,533
Nobody specifically told me

184
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,953
that was under the purview
of the president of ad sales!

185
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:01,290
So, if anyone wants to buy
30 million dollars'-worth of ad time,

186
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,168
or work out
some sort of licensing arrangement,

187
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,462
basically, what you need to know about me

188
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,132
is I am desperate
and will say yes to anything.

189
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,635
Let the negotiations begin!

190
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,929

[BoJack thinking]
<i>Who sent this? What do they know?</i>

192
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,563
<i>Do they know things? Let's find out.</i>

193
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,815
Hey, BoJack!
Did the<i> L.A. Gazette</i> come today?

194
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,985
Apparently, I'm on their
"35 Over 35 but Under 40" list.

195
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,279
Uh, no, nothing came today!
I wasn't looking at anything.

196
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,447
Why are you so insistent
that something came today?

197
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,241
Obsessed with things coming much?

198
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,202
<i>Whatever this creep has on me</i>
<i>could ruin the show, And there goes</i>

199
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,453
<i>Gina's newfound happiness.</i>

200
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,914
<i>I gotta find out who sent this.</i>
<i>For her sake.</i>

201
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,837
This case is like the movie,
<i>Love Actually.</i> No leads.

202
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,964
-Hope the coroner can help us out.
-She will.

203
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,757
We got a lot of history,
me and the coroner.

204
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,011
Here's a picture.
She used to be one of my closest friends.

205
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,012
Used to?

206
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,055
Times change.

207
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,182
[splatters]

208
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,603
[BoJack] Diane! Diane! Diane!
I know you sent me the note!

209
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,897
-What note?
-What <i>note?</i>

210
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,357
The one you slipped under my door.

211
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,736
See, great actors embody their roles,
so I've picked up some detective skills.

212
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,364
That letter "I" is in a nerd font.
I'd say it's from<i> The Believer.</i>

213
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,159
And you're the only person
who reads<i> The Believer.</i>

214
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,537
First of all, <i>The Believer</i>
is a very popular $12 magazine.

215
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,748
And I didn't send this dumb note.

216
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,460
You love revealing my secrets.
And not sharing your cobbler!

217
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,046
-[sighs]
-Who else could have done it?

218
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,714
I don't know.
Who'd you piss off?

219
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,717
[thinking] <i>She's right.</i>
<i>Lotta people have it out for me.</i>

[Philbert narrating] <i>But who the hell</i>
<i>would want to hurt the chief?</i>

221
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,096
Hey, Philbert. This your friend?

222
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,891
-[gasps]
-A second strangling victim.

223
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,143
If it's the same killer,
he's a real pain in the neck.

224
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,853
Hey, there's being sassy,

225
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,106
and there's going over the line
with humor. Literally.

226
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,360
All right, enough chokes.
Let's put together a list of suspects.

227
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,612
Yeah, suspects.

-<i>Three, two...</i>
-Uh...

239
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,599
All right, you get another second here.
What's going on?

240
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,436
-I'm doing a survey for the cable company.
<i>-All right.</i>

241
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,271
I've got time for a survey.
Kinda fun to think

242
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,441
big-time corporations care
about what little old Kyle thinks.

243
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,736
[speaking with mock Scottish accent]
On a scale of one to ten,

244
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,738
how would you rate your cable service?

245
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,990
Oh, that's a tough one, right off the bat.
Let's see.

246
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,076
Don't take this personally,
but I'm gonna say eight.

247
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,579
And on a scale of one to ten,
how is your marriage?

248
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,665
Well, that's a little personal,
don't ya think?

249
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,083
Oh, okay. Uh...

250
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,545
But I guess if it helps your survey--
my wife and I had some rough patches,

251
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,422
but we're stronger
now we've got through them.

252
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,675
-I'm gonna give us an eight.
-Okay, so it sounds like your wife

253
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,053
isn't obsessed with a desire
to exact revenge on a former friend?

254
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,265
-What?
-For cable-related reasons or otherwise?

255
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,727
-I don't think so.
-Okay, wonderful.

256
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,894
On a scale of one to ten,

257
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,522

00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,483
-Boy, that's a sticky one.
-I'm just reading what's in front of me.

Pfft. I don't even know how to judge that.

260
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,655
Uh, let's say
that one is, "Horribly scarred

261
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,198
by an older man she trusted

262
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,744
and is now dedicated to getting
the word out about the bad thing he did,"

263
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,288
[normal voice]
and ten is, "Slowly explored her body

265
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,876

well-adjusted?"

266
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,127

to eights.

00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,590
-Okay, thanks, bye!
<i>-Wait! Don't go. I got a couple questions.</i>

269
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,467
Question number one.
What channel is Netflix?

270
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,552
Gotta get back to Scotland.
You're the man now, dawg.

271
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,220
Well, that didn't pan out.

272
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,681
We got no leads,
and the Olive Garden won't deliver.

273
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,892
Sure, when you're there, you're "family."

274
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,437
There's gotta be something we're not
seeing. All these victims, strangled.

275
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,523
Yeah, this case just gets
strangler and strangler.

276
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,192
You made puns!

277
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,860
You could laugh after two murders.

278
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,113
But now we're talking about eight
innocent people killed in five days!

279
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,115
This guy's really going full throttle.

280
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,410
[chuckles] I guess it's just funnier
when I do it.

281
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,913
-The point is, we have to stop him.
-[sighs]

282
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,584
So many people could have sent that note.
Why do so many people hate me?

283
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,377
Oh, put up a picture of Crispin Glover.

284
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,088
Apparently, I spilled coffee on his shirt
in a dream he had.

285
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,799
I'm not sure production assistants

286
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,176
are supposed to help make lists
of enemies.

287
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,387
Hey, if you're gonna whine like that,
put your own picture on the wall too.

288
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,515
Oh, shit, what time is it?
I gotta get to set.

289
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,558
We <i>are</i> on set.

290
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,144
Oh, yeah. We are, in fact, on set.

292
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,404
[Flip] I'm telling you, BoJack's onto us!

[Princess Carolyn]
Oh, he's not onto anything.

294
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,367
[Flip] I think he knows
about the popsicle guys!

295
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,952
-Wha--?
-Pickles, about dinner tonight,

296
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,288
am I any network with a show
starring Kyle Bornheimer?

297
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,249
-Because I have to cancel.
-Shh, shh, shh!

298
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,376
Nothing's wrong.
Just another heavy night of shooting.

299
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,503
-Sha-sha-shh!
-Gotta go! Love you!

300
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,129
-Shh! Shh!
-Love being monogamous!

-[phone beeps]
-[sighs] Hey, BoJack!

302
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,593
Look at you, skulking behind doors
with a malevolent aura.

303
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,595
-Someone is hiding something.
-How did you know?

304
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,932
-Did you talk to Diane?
-Yes. I did talk to Diane.

305
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,268
BoJack, I promise it was a one-time thing.

306
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,104
The worst thing that could happen is
if I lost your respect over this.

307
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,982
I couldn't live with myself
if your respect for me fell any lower

308
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,984
than the current level of respect
you have for me,

309
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,236
which as we both know is very high.

310
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,280
Can we pretend
this whole thing never happened?

311
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,323
-What whole thing?
-Thank you.

312
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,369
There's gotta be a simple explanation.

313
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,955
No. I'm telling you,
this whole thing is rotten, Gina.

314
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,874
-[Flip] You said "Gina" again!
-What?

315
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,793
You called her "Gina."
The character's name is "Sassy."

316
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,130
Right. Um, no.
This whole thing is rotten, Sassy.

317
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,340
Whatever it is,
we'll figure it out together, okay?

318
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,509
-Okay.
-In the morning.

In fact, in many ways,

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,111
-Fritz, you're not real.
-Does this feel real enough for ya?

327
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,031
[grunts] You don't have to do this.
You can trust me.

328
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,115

I have to find a way protect her! Get it?

-You're at home.

-What are we waiting for? Come on.
-All right, set it up!

360
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,789
BoJack, what's going on with you?

361
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,667
I can't tell her the truth.
She's safer knowing nothing.

362
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,546
-You realize you just said that out loud?
-Oh. Sorry. Too many night shoots.

363
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,006
It's so hard to lie to her.

364
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,633
You just said that out loud, too.
You do know this is real, right?

365
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,760
More real than you even know, dollface.

366

-[yelps]
-Todd Chavez. The man in charge.

371
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,655
The guy who has a face,

372
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,825
which is what clocks have,
and also hands, which clocks have, too.

373
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,953
I should have known his clocky-handy face
was behind this.

374
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,414
-Hi, BoJack!
-The gif is up, bozzo.

-Spill the beefs.
-Okay, you got me.

In order to offset the costs
of video hosting,

377
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,797
I needed to sign a licensing deal
with a pharmaceutical company,

378
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:34,094
but I think this still maintains
the dignity of Flip's original vision.

"Oopsie, gotta poopsie"?

380
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,265
That sounds like a thing
Philbert would say, right?

381
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,601
We're also doing a board game, a lunchbox,

382
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,604

-Uh, no, that's--
-Tell me the truth, Chavez!

386
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,907
Have you always been
secretly jealous of me?

387
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,285
Did you hate that you were a nothing
and I was a successful cop?

388
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,330
Did you create this entire
television show to destroy me?

389
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,417
That's a lotta questions,
but, generally, no.

that Philbert gets.

484
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,430
-You sent this note. It was <i>you.</i>
-No, Philbert.

485
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,058
[Sassy] <i>It was you.</i>
<i>The guilt was unbearable.</i>

486
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,560
<i>It ate you up inside,</i>
<i>and drove you to madness.</i>

487
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,397
-Bullshit.
-Oh? Or should I say... no "O."

488
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,191
[gasps]

489
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,110
It was you! It was all you! Literally!

490
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,071
No! No!

491
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,281
You don't remember shooting that scene?

492
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,408
Well, I-- I guess
I've been a little distracted.

493
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,077
"Distracted"? You've been high.

494
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,205
No. It's not high, Gina, that's not--
It makes things normal.

495
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,458
Normal? You're a goddamn mess,
and you're gonna ruin my show.

496
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,335
-Oh, <i>your </i>show?
-That's not what I meant.

497
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,004
No, that's very helpful.
I understand what you're worried about.

498
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,840
-I thought it was me, but it's your show.
-BoJack, listen.

499
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,426
It would really be a shame
if your show was ruined

500
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,720
by your boyfriend's
debilitating drug problem.

501
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,514
-Stop it.
-Where would you go to sing

502
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,474
-with your popsicle dancers?
-Popsicle dancers?

503
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,059
-Give me my pills back!
-No.

504
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:14,976
So, what happens now?

505
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,478
-Turn yourself in.
-Are you kidding?

506
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,939
I know there's a good man
buried somewhere in there, Philbert.

507
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,399
He's the man I fell in love with.

508
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,610
-That man is <i>dead!</i>
-[grunts]

509
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,113
Gina. I'm not kidding. The pills. Now!
[bangs]

510
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,906
-You're out of control.
-Give them to me!

511
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,282
[growls]

512
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,494
Stop! Let go! You're hurting me!

513
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,955
-[Gina gasping]
-[grunting]

514
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,749
-[wheezing]
-[Flip] Okay, cut!

515
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,626
See, <i>that </i>looks real.

516
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,711
-I'm going.
-Gina, no. Come on.

517
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,714
Stay away from me. Get help. Or don't.

518
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,467
-I don't care anymore.
-Gina, no. Uh...!

519
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,553
[gulps]

520
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,888
-BoJack grunting]
-[Gina] Please, stop.

521
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,890
BoJack, he said, "Cut."

522
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:58,812
BoJack? Buddy?
I think he's really strangling her.

523
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,065
What? Oh, no. Turn the camera back on.

524
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,694
-Gina, you okay?
-Okay, that's enough.

525
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,155
-[screams]
-[gasps, panting]

526
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,077
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-[moans]

527
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,622
[gasping]

528
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:21,793
Uh...?
