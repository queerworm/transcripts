or even try to retroactively fix
my own childhood

335
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,366
by recreating someone else's,

336
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,661
and I'm especially not doing
all those things at once!

337
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,911
Okay.

338
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,706
- [loud crash]
- What happened?

339
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,874
Did somebody hurt
my precious baby?

340
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,418
Sarah Lynn! Ah!
What the--?

341
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,170
Oh, hey, BoJack.

342
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,963
I told my friends they could
tear this wall out to build

343
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,132
a sweet cocaine booth/sex
closet.

344
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,301
- Is that cool?
- No, that's not cool.

345
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,387
Oof. Way to harsh the vibe,
Kissinger.

346
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,306
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.

347
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,809
I thought this was a place
where Sarah Lynn

348
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,688
could finally be Sarah Lynn,
but I guess...

349
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,898
that's too much, man.

350
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,568
I always loved
that catch phrase.

351
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,111
Can your friends at least take
the artwork off the wall first?

352
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:08,157
Ooh.
I want to say yes, but no.

353
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:12,286
- Okay, good talk.
- Wha-- Are you serious?

354
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,252
The reason I have called
this house meeting is--

355
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,254
Todd, how many times
have we been over this?

356
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,757
You don't have the authority
to call house meetings.

357
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,468
Only I can call a house meeting.
You can propose a house meeting.

358
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,470
All right, fine, fine, fine,
but the reason I propose

359
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,055
- this house meeting--
- Your proposal has been

360
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,307
submitted and
is under board review.

361
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,769
- Proposal denied.
- BoJack, this Sarah Lynn thing

362
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,188
is getting out of control, okay?
She's taking advantage of you.

363
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,900
What? No she's not.
We have a special relationship.

364
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,651
You couldn't possibly
understand.

365
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,904
Oh, my God. Look at what
she's done to your house.

366
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,988
All right, look, I mean,
I stepped on a needle earlier.

367
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,574
I think I'm addicted
to heroin now,

368
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,034
so now, that's probably
gonna be a whole thing.

369
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,953
I have to say,
I agree with Todd.

370
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,580
You're not this girl's father,
and you're not doing her

371
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,832
any favors by refusing
to set boundaries.

372
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,209
Look, I played a dad
for nine years on TV,

373
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,211
so I think I know a little bit
more about parenting

374
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,380
than you two jokers.
The kids on <i>Horsin' Around</i>

375
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,006
didn't need boundaries.

376
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,468
All they needed was
some good, old-fashioned love.

377
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,053
BoJack!
This is not a TV show, okay?

378
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,972
This is real life.

379
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,225
Ah! Lemur on fire!
Lemur on fire!

380
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,189
Some good, old-fashioned love,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

381
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:26,736
I'm gonna give it to her
so... hard.

382
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,113
You know, I feel like
we don't ever hang out.

383
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,867
Here you are, milady,

384
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,995
a gin and nutmeg
just like you asked.

385
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,956
Ugh.
Too much nutmeg.

386
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,249
Well, you know what
would taste even better?

387
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,836
An endorsement
for a Slovakian yogurt.

388
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,963
Could Vanessa Gecko
get you that?

389
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,925
Vanessa Gecko got Andrew

390
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,385
and she has skybox seats
at the Staples Center.

391

Well, that's horrible.
Why would you tell me that now?

407
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,224
I don't know. The sun setting
over those two hills

408
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,100
made me think of a big ass,

By 20, I was packing stadiums.

they masturbated to.

You're not my dad.
You're just a rugged, older man

00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,524
Yeah, 'cause if this got out,
oh, I would get flayed!

498
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,736
Oh, I'm done being
the voice of reason.

499
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,448
It's exhausting.
I got to take an angry nap.

500
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,867
Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

501
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,327
I know. I know.
She's taking advantage of me.

502
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,080
Actually, it kind of feels
like you're the one

503
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,790
taking advantage of her.
She's the one

504
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,292
with substance abuse problems
and daddy issues.

505
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,086
Hey, we both have
substance abuse problems

506
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,255
- and daddy issues.
- Yeah, but she came to you

507
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,299
- for help.
- [sighs]

508
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,302
Hey, notice how
I've been ignoring you,

509
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,763
playing hard to get?
Only makes you want me more.

510
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,473
Ugh. Go stand
on the other side of the room.

511
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,475
- Okay.
- Sarah Lynn, get your coat.

512
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,685
- I'm taking you to rehab.
- Nah,

513
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,938
I was gonna keep hanging out
here if that's all right.

514
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,107
- No, it's not all right.
- What?

515
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,942
This place isn't good
for you.

516
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,820
You need to go where you can
get help, real help.

517
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,072
But I thought you were always
gonna be there for me

518
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,323
like you said.

519
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,034
I will always
be there for you.

520
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,744
Cut, let's take ten.

521
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,664
That's ten, everyone.
Let's make it a tight ten.

522
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,915
- These pages are shit.
- [coughs]

523
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,500
you understand?
Shit.

524
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,169
I wouldn't wipe my ass
with these pages.

525
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,920
It would defeat the whole
purpose of wiping my ass.

526
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,755
- Phone for you.
- Uh-huh.

527
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,381
You get me points
on the back end?

528
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,883
- [coughs]
- Well, I told you

529
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,135
I'm not gonna do it
unless I get points.

530
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,719
Oh, they can't find any?

531
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,013
Well, maybe they could
suck some out of my dick!

532
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,388
- [coughs]
- I'm on the phone.

533
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,349
- You're being very rude.
- [laughs]

534
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,560
You promised me you would
always be there.

535
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,980
Sarah Lynn,
this is for your own good.

536
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,648
You can't stay here anymore.

537
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,775
Okie-doke.
I guess I'll just move out

538
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,194
and find
one of the billion people

539
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,070
who will let me party
at their house.

540
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,906
Uh, well,
you should not do that.

541
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,617
Oh, I know. I know,
but I can, so I will.

542
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,536
I'm at a place right now
where I never need

543
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,455
to grow as a person
or rise to an occasion

544
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,042
because I can constantly
just surround myself

545
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,627
with sycophants and enablers
until I die tragically young.

546
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,420
- Wh-What?
- Yeah,

547
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,590
it's pretty much
too late for me.

548
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,510
Well, them's the breaks.
Take it sleazy, everybody.

549
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,263
Oh, by the way,
I called Vanessa Gecko,

550
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:10,931
and I'm meeting with her
tomorrow.

551
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,642
- Thanks for the suggestion.
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

552
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,854
Hey, you guys want to hear
my new catchphrase?

553
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:20,649
Suck a dick, dumb shits!
[blows raspberry]

554
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,693
[grunting]

555
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,529
Laura, the dummy took the bait.
Now for phase two.

556
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:29,325
Is she gone?
Is it safe to come out?

557
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,409
Leak to the trades
that Andrew Garfield's agent

558
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,412
is taking meetings with his ex,
get it all over town,

559
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,332
wait an hour,
then get me lunch with Andrew

560
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:40,044
on the books for this weekend,
someplace Italian.

561
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,795
I really blew it,
didn't I?

562
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,257
I mean, maybe you could
have been a better role model

563
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,260
when she was young, but also,
she never really had a chance.

564
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,387
This is what our celebrity
culture does to people.

565
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:53,182
So what you're saying is,
Everything is society's fault,

566
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,892
and we as individuals
never need

567
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,685
to take responsibility
for anything?

568
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,355
Uh, no. Not exactly.
I was just saying that--

569
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,941
Yeah. I like that.
I didn't do anything wrong

570
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,609
because I can't do
anything wrong

571
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,403
because we're all just products
of our environment,

572
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,695
bouncing around like marbles

573
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,155
in the game
of Hungry Hungry Hippos

574
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,865
that is our random
and cruel universe.

575
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,575
Wait, no, that's not even
what I'm saying--

576
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,203
Yeah, It's not my fault.
It's society.

577
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,789
Everything is
because of society!

578
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,083
- BoJack, that--
- Dude, just let him have this.

579
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,501
Hooray!
Everything is meaningless!

580
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,338
<i>Nothing I do</i>

581
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,759

582

Oh, I got everything.

583
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,640
