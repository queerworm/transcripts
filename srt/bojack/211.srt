00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,387
What are you doing here?

00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,974
{\an8}You said if I was in town
to give you a call.

00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,059
-Wanna get a drink?
-It's eight in the morning.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,687
It's 5:00 p.m. in Los Angeles.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,981
-That's not true.
-I don't know what time it is.

6
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,859
When's the last time you slept?
You look like shit.

7
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,444
Really? 'Cause you look like a million...

8
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,031
-Yeah, let's get you back to my place.
-What about the store?

9
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,617
What if somebody has an emergency
and they need more...

10
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:34,994
turquoise shit?

11
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,203
It's New Mexico.

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,245
They'll find it.

13
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,040
-It's really good to see you.
-It's good to see you, too.

14
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,751
I can't wait for you
to meet Kyle and the kids.

-Never came up?

00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,429
{\an8}-All these years?
-It was a long time ago.

00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,057
{\an8}Oh, gross. Mom, Trip has a boner again.

00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,975

-Trip, let's dial back the boners.

00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,643
{\an8}-Gross.
-What? I can't help it.

00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,437
{\an8}-Trip, ew.
-You are at the breakfast table

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,189
{\an8}with your parents, your big sister,
and an old man.

40

{\an8}-What could possibly be arousing you?
-Am I the old man?

00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,236
I don't understand how it works.

42
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,740
I was just excited that I finished
the maze on the back of the cereal box.

43
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,700
So, BoJack. What brings you to Tesuque?

44
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,619
So, we're just gonna change
the subject

45
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,329
and pretend Trip isn't being a huge perv
right now?

00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,957
Yeah, Penny, that's the plan.

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,417
Talking about it makes it worse.
It likes attention.

48
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,461
{\an8}Charlotte told me if I was ever
in New Mexico

49
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,047
{\an8}-I should call her.
-But what are you doing in New Mexico?

50
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,174
-Yeah, what <i>are</i> you doing in New Mexico?
-I, uh...

51
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,511
You didn't drive all this way
just to see my mom, did you?

52
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,138
[laughs] No, of course not.

53
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,099
That would be crazy,

54
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,309
to come all this way just to see a woman

55
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,104
I haven't had a real conversation with
in 30 years.

56
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,273
-I mean, obviously, that would be crazy.
-Uh...

57
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,359
-Because she has a family, which is great.
-Yeah.

58
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,570
-You guys are great.
-Yeah.

59
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,865
So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.

60
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,367
-Mm.
-On my way to see...

61
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,869
-On your way to sea?
-Yes.

62
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,122
To the sea. To the shining sea.

63
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,165
Because I'm here to buy... a boat.

64
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:49,003
-At the... Santa Fe Boat Show.
-I've never heard of a Santa Fe Boat Show.

65
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,379
{\an8}That's 'cause... it's a secret boat show.

66
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,506
{\an8}-Invitation-only.
-Huh.

67

{\an8}-Wow.
-[Penny] Hold up.

{\an8}If you live in Los Angeles,
which is right on the ocean,

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,309
{\an8}why would you drive all the way here
to go to a boat show

71
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,896
{\an8}-in the middle of landlocked New Mexico?

{\an8}Sounds perfect, Knute.

80

{\an8}-Now tell me, do we need a poop deck?
-Huh?

-Well, not for you.

-With your career.

Anyway, I know you're just in town
for the boat show,

00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,812

If there's anything I can do
to help around here--

111
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,403
Mom, Dad was supposed to take me driving
after school today,

112
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,448
but now he's gotta take Trip
to his dumb-ass basketball game.

113
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,576
-It's the quarter-finals.
-You'll just get a hard-on in the game.

114
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,080
Now I will get a hard-on because
you made me think about it. Thanks a lot.

115
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,374
-I'll take you driving this weekend.
-I need to practice every day.

116
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,877
I'm the only senior
who still doesn't have a license.

117
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,254
It's embarrassing.

118
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,132
Well, I got the store,
and I already took the morning off,

119
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,134
so unless you know any other adults...

120
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,176
Can BoJack take me?

121
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,094
-Huh?
-What?

122
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,845
-I mean, he is an adult.
-Uh...

123
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,764
Well, I mean, if it's okay with BoJack.

124
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,516
You'd really be doing me a huge favor.

125
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,771
Well, I guess I could make some time...
before the boat show.

126
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,986
Keep your eyes on the road,
both hands on the wheel.

127
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,071
-Okay.
-And don't text and drive,

128
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,322
unless it's an emergency,

129
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,700
like you have a really funny thing
that you just have to text someone.

130
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,912
-Got it.
-So, let me ask you something. Tsk.

131
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,831
Do your parents really love each other,

132
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,167
or is it
a stay-together-for-the-kids situation?

133
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,002
What? Why would you ask me that?

134
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,920
I don't know. Just making conversation.

135
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,965
-Why do we keep passing the same house?
-No, I don't. Shut up.

136
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,093
You shut up. What's the story?
Cute guy live there? Girl you hate?

137
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,845
College kid that gives you Adderall?

138
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,345
Okay, fine.

139
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,431
That's Diego Mendoza's house.

He's just this stupid guy.

141
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,061
He's in my calculus class,
and sometimes we'll do this thing

142
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,605
where he goes, "Hey,"
and then I go, "Hey."

143
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,066
Then he goes, "What's the homework?"
and I tell him.

144
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,486
It's not like a big deal or anything,
but it's like this thing we do.

145
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,322
-Cool thing.
-So, anyway...

because he knows I'm a real girl

If you're so mostly chill,
why do you keep driving by his house?

157

In case he comes out,
to, like, check the mail or something.

158

And he'll be like, "Oh, hey."
And I'll be like, "Hey."

161
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,488
-'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.
-That's the whole plan?

162
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,076
Well, it's better than your plan
for buying a boat in New Mexico.

163
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,579
Dude, what are you really doing here?

164
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,455
[BoJack sighs]

165
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,127
I didn't... like the person I was in L.A.

166
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,672
And I didn't know where else to go.

167
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,133
-Please do not tell your parents.
-Well, I won't,

168
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,676
but I think people are gonna notice

169
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,970
if you go to a boat show
and don't come back with a boat.

170
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,638
[BoJack sighs]

171
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,307
Oh, my God, there he is. Get down!

172
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,892
-Oh, my God. Oh!
-What are you doing?

173
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,019
-What happened to your plan?
-Oh! I panicked.

174
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,397
I didn't know
he'd be wearing a tank top. [screams]

175
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,903
-Don't tell my parents I crashed your car.
-Yeah, deal.

176
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,201
-They didn't even put me in.
-[sighs] I'm sorry, sweetheart.

177
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,036
You did some great cheering
from the bench,

178
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,414
and for someone who never plays,
you sweat a lot.

179
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,999
-Maybe they'll put me in next game.
-Sure, they will.

180
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,876
[whispering] No way they'll do that.

181
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,794
[truck beeping]

182
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,088
-[Kyle in normal voice] What the...?
-Huh?

183
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,714
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

184
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,049
What a boat.

185
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,343
-Can I go on your boat?
-I don't see what's stopping you.

186
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,596
Yeah! Woo-hoo! I'm going on a boat!
I got my way!

187
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,680
Where's your car?

188
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,058
I junked it.
Who needs a car when you got a boat?

189
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,936
-Uh... well--
-[Trip] Whoa, sweet, a waterbed.

190
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,315
On a boat!
Think of the amount of floating!

191
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,024
Please stay out of the bedroom.

192
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,484
-Does she have a name?
-Who?

193
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,155
-The boat? It does not.
-Come on. You gotta give her a name.

194
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,365
You should call her the <i>Escape From L.A.</i>

195
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,285
That actually is a good name for <i>it,</i>
the nongendered object.

196
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,078
Oh, she's a good girl.

197
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,248
[chuckles] I can tell,
she's a good girl, isn't she?

198
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,376
-Or are you a bad girl?
-Are you flirting with my boat right now?

199
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,421
No, just kidding around.
I'm kind of the comedian of the family.

200
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,923
-Mind if I get on top of her?
-Knock yourself out.

201
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,508
Dad, don't be gross.

202
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,094
-Wow, you really got a boat.
-Yeah, sure did.

203
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,054
So, does that mean you're leaving?

204
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,639
Oh, I, uh...

205
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:38,977
Yeah, I guess, uh... I guess I did...
do what I came here to do.

206
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,856
You don't have to go right away, right?
At least stay till the end of the weekend.

207
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,608
-Yeah? I don't wanna put you out.
-Oh, it's no bother.

208
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,779
And at least now you have your own bed.
Besides... heh, everyone here loves you.

209
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,281
Uh, everyone?

210
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,825
[Kyle] Don't use the bathroom.
It'll end up in the driveway.

211
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,329
-[Trip] Too late.
-Seriously, stay as long as you want.

212
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,498
[cell phone rings]

213
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,875
-What?
-BoJack, great news.

214
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,544
Do you still want to go to New York?
Because Jill Pill--

215
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,254
Jill Pill? I don't care about this.

216
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,216
Okay, moving on. Do you remember
when we were at Herb's funeral

217
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,551
-and you told me--?
-Whatever it is, I don't care.

218
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,803
[Trip] Oh, there's a kitchen!
Can we make pizza bagels?

219
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,430
[Kyle] Yeah, family dinner on the boat.

220
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,431
[family laughs]

221
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,641
Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back
on set Monday.

222
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:22,020
What? How long do I have
to keep putting out fires for you?

223
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,523
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
Just let them burn.

224
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,941
-What?
-I think I might be here a while.

225
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,568
<i>Listen, I--</i>

226
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,029
[grunts]

227
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,113
[sighs]

228
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,283
Well, who's getting seasick? [retches]

229
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,535
[family laughs]

230
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,537
Just kidding. [chuckles]

231
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,664
It's such an eyesore.

232
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,293
Well, I'm sure if we ask them nicely,
they'll move the boat.

233
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,466
[husband sighs]

234
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,633
BoJack?

235
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,844
-Yeah?
-Supper's ready.

236
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,223
So, I had another meeting today
with the Drama Chair at SFCC.

237
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,141
They're gonna offer me a position.

238
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,061
-What? That's amazing.
-Oh, that's cool. Congratulations.

239
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:07,065
There's a real stick-in-the-mud dean there
who doesn't like my in-your-face style.

240
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:12,028
If I know me, it might lead
to some pretty zany misadventures.

241
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,863
Mm. Brussels sprouts are delicious, Mom.

242
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,992
It's funny you brought up the Brussels
sprouts, because I think they're terrible.

243
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,494
[Kyle snorts, then laughs]

244
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,662
I'm just kidding around.
These are great, hon.

245
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,747
[all laugh]

246
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,208
Penny, did you hear my bit
about the Brussels sprouts?

247
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,169
A <i>bit</i> is what they call a <i>joke</i>
in show business.

248
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,712
-Right, BoJack?
-That's right.

249
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,424
String a bunch of those together
and you got yourself a riff.

250
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,802
[groans] You're not funny, Dad.
Your jokes are never funny.

251
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,887
Okay... I think someone's in a mood.

252
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,514
Oh, my God. I'm not in a mood.

253
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,308
Whatever. Get bent.

254
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,518
I hate my life. I can't wait to be dead.

255
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,436
[door slams]

256
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,979
[BoJack and Charlotte] I'll talk to her.

257
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,272
Everyone said for months

258
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,357
-that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.
-Yeah?

259
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,360
-But he keeps not doing it.
-That is so typical Diego.

260
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,447
So, I thought, okay,
if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.

261
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,115
-Way to take initiative.
-Oh. Rookie mistake.

262
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,866
So, I asked him and he said no.

263
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,621
And then this other girl, Lyla K.,
came up to him and was just like, "Hey."

264
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,373
And he was like, "Hey."
And that's our thing.

265
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,626
Well, I don't want to tell tales
out of school,

266
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,796
but this Lyla K. character
sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.

267
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,592
Thank you, that is exactly what she is.
It's weird that nobody talks about it.

268
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,303
Well, you know, sometimes it's nice
to not have a date,

269
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,887
-because you can actually--
-Mom.

270
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,724
I can't go to the prom without a date.
It's not like when you were in high school

271
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,311
-and you'd go to your sock hops.
-Do you think

272
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,356
-I went to high school in the '50s?
-Penny, hey, I got an idea.

273
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,898
-You should take me to the prom.
-Huh?

274
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,775
Everybody loves having BoJack around.

275
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,943
What? Why?

276
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,655
Think about it. If you went with Diego,
you'd be nervous.

277
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,448
<i>"Does he like me? Am I cool?"</i>

278
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,409
<i>But with me you can just relax</i>
<i>and enjoy yourself.</i>

279
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,662
<i>Diego will see you</i>
<i>have a good time without him,</i>

280
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,413
<i>and that'll make him super jealous.</i>

281
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,915
<i>So, he'll come up to you,</i>
<i>and he'll say, "Hey."</i>

282
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,668
<i>And then you say, "Hey."</i>

283
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,670
-Oh, that's so cold.
-Right?

284
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,921
-Wait--
-Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.

285
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,299
-How is that cold?
-Then he'll say, "Wanna dance?"

286
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,843
<i>And you'll say,</i>
<i>"I'm busy right now. Maybe later."</i>

287
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,804
<i>And then... never dance with him.</i>

288
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,098
-That'll show him.
-Wait-- I'm sorry.

289
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,851
-Don't you want to dance with Diego?
-Stop poking holes, Charlotte.

290
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,354
-This is a great plan.
-Yeah, Mom, don't poke holes.

291
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,565
Hey, Dad, BoJack's taking me to prom!

292
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:16,361
Oh, [chuckles] yeah, well,
that's definitely the better idea.

293
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,615
[Kyle] Okay, everyone smile. Real big.

294
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,950
-[all] Cheese.
-I think we have enough pictures.

295
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,453
Oh, come on, it's your first prom.
Indulge us.

296
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,122
Taking pictures before prom
is so bourgeois.

297
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,374
And who are you again?

298
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,876
-I'm Maddy.
-Maddy's my best friend.

299
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,339
-I thought Alison F. was your best friend.
-That was like three best friends ago.

300
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,926
[snickers] You were best friends
with Alison F.?

301
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,929
-No.
-Hey, BoJack, I'm Pete.

302
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,974
But they call me Pete Repeat
because I always say everything twice.

303
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,977
-Everything?
-Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

304
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,396
-Okay.
-Ah, damn.

305
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,981
I forgot to say that twice, didn't I?
Usually I do it.

306
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:54,941
Cool.

307
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,110
[rock music playing over stereo]

308
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,448
Wow, Ray-Ray and the Bean
are already posting pics on Instagram.

309
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,283
-What?
-Hashtag much?

310
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,284
Let me see.

311
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,244
Whoa, hold on. Responsible adult.

312
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,079
-What are you drinking?
-Nothing.

313
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,124
-Hand it over.
-[scoffs] Fine.

314
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:15,503
Ugh. Red Bull and vodka? What are you, 12?
You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.

315
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,465
Do they teach you anything in school?
Make a left at the light.

316
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,799
-Where are we going?
-I'll get you some bourbon.

317
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,886
And you'll cut it with water.
That way you don't get hungover.

318
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,929
Wait, really?

319
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,682
If you're gonna drink,
you should be smart about it.

320
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,685
Awesome. Wait.
How many times did I just say "awesome"?

321
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,062
Was it twice or was it once?
Ah, it was probably twice.

322
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,440
Yeah, it's twice. Pete Repeat.

323
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,567

[opossum screeches]

325
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,658
-Ugh. It burns.
-Yeah, 'cause it's not a juice box.

326
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,866
You want some?

327
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,201
-No, thanks.
-[coughing] Pussy.

328
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,286
I'm driving.

329
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,287
Well, more for me.

330
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,623
This prom is really bourgeois.

331
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,126
-Lyla K. is so pretty.
-Shut up. She's got nothing on you.

332
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,921
Why is nobody dancing?
We gotta get this party started.

333
00:13:59,005 --> 00:13:59,922
[sighs]

334
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,132
Beat it, Poindexter.

335
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,176
-Poindexter?
-It's a nerd reference... [sighs]

336
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,344
-Just beat it.
-Ah!

337
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,386
-[feedback squeaks]
-Huh?

338
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,513
-Hey!
-What's the big idea?

339
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:10,141
Why is there an adult
at our high school prom?

340
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,393
All right, folks.
We're taking it back to 1991,

341
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:16,105
when a new funky-fresh dance craze
took this nation by storm.

342
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,774
-All right. [chuckles]
-I'm listening.

343
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,485
As a teen, I'm open to new experiences.

344
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,698
Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat,
and here... we... go. Waka waka.

345
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,283
Now boys and girls,
if you wanna do the BoJack,

346
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,661
-take your hands and put them on your--
-Boo!

347
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,705
-This sucks.
-This guy's bad.

348
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,207
God, no! This is not
the immediate praise I expected.

349
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,792
[R &amp; B ballad playing over speakers]

350
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,251
[students cheering]

351
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,253
This prom sucks.

352
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,421
You can say that again.

353
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,632
-I know.
-[slurring] My flask got empty.

354
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:46,093
Can we be back to the car,
so, for more get for put in it?

355
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,262
Or we could go back to the car
and just leave.

356
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,891
-You can't just leave the prom.
-Of course you can. You're young.

357
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,518
You can do whatever you want.

358
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,894
That's what they never tell you

359
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,522
until it's too late.
You don't have to be here.

360
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,274
Yeah, is right. Society is everywhere.

361
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,277
-Society.
-Well, what else are we gonna do?

362
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,780
I'd say it's time to get down,
time to hit the town.

363
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,491
Is that a lyric
from that "Do the BoJack" song?

364
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,535
Just get in the car.

365
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,378
[Penny laughs]

366
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,005
Okay, one... two... three.

367
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,053
[Penny] Wow. That is so beautiful.

368
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,221
[Maddy burps]

369
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,515
Hey, you wanna climb up
on the water tower?

370
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,016
We could see the whole city.

371
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,143
Yeah, I wanna go.

372
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,854
-[Maddy vomits]
-Oh.

373
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,313
Oh, careful there, Maddy.

374
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,107
Actually, I'm gonna stay right here.

375
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,150
This is nice.

376
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,861
[both grunting]

377
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,488
Wow, how'd you think to do all this?

378
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,866
I don't know. It just came to me.

379
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,243
I'm really glad we left that stupid prom,

380
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,121
but I'm kind of bummed
we didn't get to dance.

381
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,248
Well, you wanna dance?

382
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,041
Yes, hold on.

383
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,501
Got it, okay.

384

Buffering still, buffering.

387
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,220
This night has been... so perfect.

388
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,389
You know, you look just like your mother.

389
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,143
[Pete] Guys?

390
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,646
I think you should come down here.

391
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,523
She's still breathing,
but she won't wake up.

392
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,359
She just had too much to drink.
Take her back to your place.

393
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,487
-She can spend the night.
-Maddy, come on.

394
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,364
No, look, my cousin had a friend
who passed out like this,

395
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,284
and she died of alcohol poisoning, man.

396
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,454
I really think we should get Maddy
to a hospital, to a hospital.

397
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,666
Did you see what I did there?
That's why they call me Pete Repeat.

398

BoJack, what do we do?

[tires screech]

400

-Society.
-Careful.

401
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,259
-I'm being careful.
-Okay.

402
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,011
-Lock the wheels.
-Watch her head.

403
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,764
Maddy's gonna be just fine.
They'll know what to do here.

404

Pete, you're in charge.

405

-Penny and I are gonna take off.
-What?

406
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,354
You don't want too many people around
in a hospital setting.

407
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,690
If anyone asks,
tell them we left the dance early,

408
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,108
and you don't know
where Maddy got the whiskey.

409
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,026
Why?

410
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,779
It's one thing if a bunch of kids
get drunk on prom night,

411
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,866
but if there's an adult there,
I was supposed to be responsible,

412
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,034
and then the whole thing feels
kind of creepy.

413

-Pete.

I'm the adult here,
and I need you to listen to me.

416

Penny and I left early.
You don't know who gave Maddy whiskey.

417
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,085
Are we clear on this?

418
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,129
I need you to be 100 percent with me here.

419
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,255
Uh...

420
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,383
Just listen to him.
He knows what he's doing.

421
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,677
It's gonna be okay.
Where did Maddy get the alcohol from?

[Maddy groaning]

423
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,805
I... I don't know.

424
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,808
And what happened to your friends
BoJack and Penny?

425
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,894
[sighs] They left early.

426
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,729
See, that's not so hard.

427
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,356
You're doing the right thing.
Don't forget that.

429
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,193
-Okay.
-Is it okay?

430
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,111
Or "okay" okay?

431
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,240
-Uh... "okay" okay.
-All right, that's what I thought.

432
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,035
You're the future of America!
Go, Penny! Go, go, go!

433
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,118
[tires screech]

434
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,665
-She's gonna be okay, right?
-She'll be fine.

435
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,000
It's a part of growing up.

436
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,545
And we did the right thing back there,
you think?

437
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,506
I... [sighs]
Look, sometimes when you're an adult,

438
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,717
the right thing
isn't always the best thing.

439
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,010
Well...

440
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,055
I had a really good time tonight.

441
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,015
Even with all the craziness.

442
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,975
This was really special.

443
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,142
I'm glad.

444
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,271
You know, everyone always treats me
like a kid.

445
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:29,025
You're the first grown-up I've ever met
who actually treats me like...

446
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,860
you know, a person.

447
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,905
So, thanks. Mwah.

448
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,656
-Well, you're welcome, Penny.
-Mm--

449
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,325
-Whoa, Penny, come on.
-If you want to do it, I'm ready.

450
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,079
I have condoms in my room.
I can put one on with my mouth.

451
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,790
-With your mouth?
-I put one on a banana in health class.

452
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,292
With your mouth?
What kind of health class--?

453
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,920
Look, you are an amazing person,
but you're 17.

454
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,380
Which is the legal age of consent
in New Mexico.

455
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,715
Okay, that's not--

456
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,468
And I didn't drink tonight,
so everything's totally legal.

457
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,387
-Penny, no.
-It's okay. I want this.

458
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,431
No, you think you do, but...

459
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,642
You don't know what you want.

460
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,520
Oh, God. [sniffs]

461
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,981
This is so dumb.

462
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,817
-No, Penny, don't--
-I'll see you tomorrow.

463
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,443
[sighs]

464
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,033
Hey.

465
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,619
-What'd you do with my daughter?
-She had a big night.

466
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,664
She was falling asleep on the ride home.
Where are the boys?

467
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,083
Trip's at a friend's house
and Kyle's asleep.

468
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,462
-You know you can get your own, right?
-Hey, do you remember that time

469
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,132
you, me and Herb let those balloons go
over Studio City?

470
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,510
Oh, yeah. Didn't we attach glow sticks
to them or something?

471
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,886
-Yeah.
-Ooh. That was really bad

472
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,846
for the environment.

473
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,722
-True, but--
-A seagull could've choked

474
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,684
-on one of those balloons.
-But it's a nice memory, right?

475
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,310
It was a fun night.

476
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,437
We had a lot of fun nights.

477
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,858
Before you left town,
you told me L.A. was a tar pit.

478
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,275
-Do you remember?
-Oh, God.

479
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,487
I said so many things when I was young.
I thought I was so deep.

480
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,491
-Well, do you still think it's true?
-Do I think L.A. is a tar pit?

481
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,868
No.

482
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,870
No, I think you're the tar pit.

483
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,455
-Me?
-No, not "you" you.

484
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,166
I'm just saying, like...

485
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,169
It doesn't matter where you are,
it's who you are,

486
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,963
and that's not gonna change
whether you're in California

487
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,175
or Maine or New Mexico.

488
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,552
You know, you can't escape... you.

489
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:24,515
-Ugh. Now you sound like my mother.
-No, what? No, I don't. [laughs]

490
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,308
[Charlotte sighs]

491
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,396
-I don't know what to do, Charlotte.
-About what?

492
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,315
I keep... making these bad decisions.

493
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,569
-And hurting people.
-Well...

494
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,655
-Can I tell you a joke?
-Is it a long joke with no punch line?

495
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,157
-No.
-Then go ahead.

496
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,452
Guy goes into the doctor's office.
Says, "Doctor, it hurts when I do this."

497
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,913
You know what the doctor says?

498
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,456
-"Don't do that."
-Yeah.

499
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,668
-That's actually... good advice.
-And you know what else?

500
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,504
The doctor in that story was a woman.

501
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,797
What?!

502
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,050
[BoJack laughs]

503
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,263
[both moan]

504
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,681
[Charlotte gasps]

505
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,808
Oh. BoJack, um...

506
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,644
-I think you got the wrong idea.
-Let's go.

507
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,813
-Let's get out of here right now.
-No, BoJack.

508
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,232
You and me, this is real.

509
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,859
-You know this is real.
-My husband is right upstairs.

510
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,528
I don't care about your husband.
All that matters is us.

511
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,322
-Don't do this, BoJack.
-I know you feel it, too.

512
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,742
So many times in my life
I've done the wrong thing,

513
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,119
but this is the right thing,

514
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,328
and I have never been more sure
of anything.

515
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,664
I've wasted so much time sitting
on my hands

516
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,875
and imagining what could have been.

517
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,295
Tell me you don't feel the same.
Tell me you haven't thought about it.

518
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,589
[Charlotte sighs]

519
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,050
-I think you should go.
-Okay.

520
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:41,968
-Tomorrow.
-Charlotte--

521
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,678
I have worked very hard to build this life
for myself.

522
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,888
I am happy here.

523
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,557
And you just roll into my life
like a hurricane.

524
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:52,103
Why? Because we knew each other
for five minutes 30 years ago?

525
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,479
-I don't know you.
-You do.

526
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,773
I don't. And you don't know me.

527
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,567
No, please.
These last few months have been amazing.

528
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,694
-I love you, your family and this town.
-Stop.

529
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,446
-I never wanted to hurt--
-BoJack--

530
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,950
I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have.
We can pretend it didn't happen.

531
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,953
-Everything can go back to normal, but--
-No, no, stop. No.

532
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,497
Please, don't make me go back to L.A.

533
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,001
I don't care where you go, BoJack,
but I can't have you around here.

534
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,753
You make me too sad.

535
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,339
Okay.

536
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,428
What are you doing here?

537
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,347
I know what I want, BoJack.

538
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,645
Go to bed, Penny.

539
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,740
[sighing]

540
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,452
Wait, what?

541
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,375
[clattering from inside]

542
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,879
[Penny whispering] Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

543
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,637
[Penny gasps]

544
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,638
-No.
-Mom.

545
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,431
-Charlotte.
-Penny, go to your room.

546
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,809
-We didn't even do anything.
-Now, Penny.

547
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,688
[Penny crying]

548
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:21,275
-Charlotte, I am so sorry--
-Don't. Don't you dare.

549
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,696
If you are not out of my driveway
in 30 minutes, I will call the police.

550
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,867
And if you ever try to contact me
or my family again,

551
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,286
I will fucking kill you.

552
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:41,337
[♪♪]

553
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,295
[can crunches]

554
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,754
[grunts]

555
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,055
[Diane] Hey.

556
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,640
Hey.

557
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,309
You're still here?

558
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,186
