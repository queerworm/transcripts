1
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,049
[thunder rumbling]

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,179
Sir, you can't send me to Vietnam.

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,014
[Nixon] I can do whatever I want.

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,810
I'm president of the goddamn
United States of America.

5
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,436
Isn't that right, Checkers?

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,772
That's what it says
on your business cards.

7
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,693
There are going to be riots
in the streets.

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,110
I'm Secretariat.

9
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,321
You think I'm afraid
of a few rioting hippies?

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,240
Don't make me laugh. Ha-hoo.

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,368
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.

12
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,203
Please, I'll do anything.

13
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,372
You gotta send someone else
in my place.

14
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:44,378
Hmm. Perhaps an arrangement can be...
arranged.

15
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:51,259
{\an8}<i>I'm just an athlete. I'm no hero.</i>
<i>My brother Jeffretariat is the hero.</i>

16
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,387
<i>He's fighting the Reds over in 'Nam,</i>

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,390
<i>which is necessary</i>
<i>to protect our way of life.</i>

18
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,601
<i>And another hero is President Nixon.</i>

19
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,022
<i>He is one groovy dude.</i>

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,400
[BoJack] Groovy.

21
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,904
[coughing]

22
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,072
What the hell are you doing?

23
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,240
Sorry, Mommy!

24
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,825
Don't you dare put that out.

25
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,913
That is a perfectly good cigarette,
and you are going to finish it.

26
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,080
But I don't wanna.

27
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,374
And I don't want to be
the mother of a quitter.

28
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,083
Finish it.

29
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,168
[coughing]

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,922
Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke
a cigarette right.

31
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:31,299
Don't you dare cry,
don't you ever cry.

32
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,467
You wanted this.

33
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,971
Are you punishing me for smoking
or for stealing?

34
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:38,473
I'm punishing you for being alive.

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,230
Ugh.

36
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,358
Uh, BoJack? You really shouldn't throw
a lit cigarette off the--

37
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,401
[fire roaring]

38
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,029
Fine. I'll call 911.

39
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,323
{\an8}[♪♪]

40
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,712
{\an8}The fire department got
everything under control,

41
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,631
{\an8}but the cable's out
for the neighborhood.

42
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,800
{\an8}I don't understand
what started the fire.

43
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,677
{\an8}Nobody knows where fires come from,
it's a mystery.

44
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,472
{\an8}Anyway, I am fired up
about my first day back on set.

45
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,390
{\an8}We're gonna finish
that big Nixon scene.

46
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,060
{\an8}We were just one shot away
before we went on hiatus.

47
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,146
{\an8}Yeah, I know.
You told me at breakfast.

48
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,147
{\an8}Why did you call me?

49
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,107
{\an8}Usually I talk to Diane
on the way to work,

50
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,027
{\an8}but she abandoned me to teach piano
in Cordovia or something.

51
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,613
Oh. Well, glad you settled for me
because Diane wasn't available.

52
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,574
{\an8}You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna kill
in this Nixon scene.

53
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,285
{\an8}BoJack gonna be in "da" house.

54
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,996
{\an8}In da White House.

55
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,875
What happened to da house set?
Da White House set?

56
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,293
{\an8}-Things changed a little.
-You cut the Nixon scene?

57
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,587
{\an8}The Nixon scene is the core
of the whole movie.

58
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,090
Where we see Secretariat
be morally corrupted

59
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,509
and get to look
into the real darkness of his soul.

60
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,845
It's still all that,
except now it happens

61
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,972
while you give a Christmas present
to your nieces

62
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,307
and they hug you
while your butt is stuck in a chimney.

63
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,101
Is one of the nieces Nixon?

64
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,895
{\an8}Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.

65
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,189
{\an8}People don't want
all that controversial stuff.

66
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,358
But we were supposed to make
a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.

67
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,028
{\an8}-Warts and all.
-Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.

68
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,530
{\an8}That's why they took the gay stuff
out of <i>A Beautiful Mind.</i>

69
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,699
Know that guy who spent 12 years
as a slave?

70
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,660
They don't talk about the 60 years
he spent as a jerk.

71
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,537
{\an8}-Kelsey, you're okay with this?
-Eh...

72
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,663
{\an8}That's showbiz.

73
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,249
{\an8}See, BoJack,
that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.

74
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,959
{\an8}Good shrugging, kid.

75
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,422
{\an8}Yo! Care-to-the-O-to-the-Lyn-to-the...

76
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,257
{\an8}That's the end of your name.
We need to talk.

77
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,760
{\an8}We'll meet in the supply closet
in one minute. Break!

78
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,095
Oh, okay.

79
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,721
Ooh, ow.

80
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,725
Carolyn, when you're in the throes
of a very ugly divorce such as I am,

81
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,771
along with all that pain and degradation
comes a certain perfect clarity,

82
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:35,943
and right now that clarity is telling me
that you and I should get out of here.

83
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,445
Well, what do you mean,
"get out of here"?

84
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:43,033
Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency,
and I want you to be my partner in crime.

85
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,202
What? But I can't just leave Vigor.

86
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,828
I've been here 20 years.

87
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,413
Who's gonna water the plants?

88
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,082
Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?

89
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,708
I started doing it as an intern,

90
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,628
but then no one told me to stop,
so it's still kind of my job.

91
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,297
Carolyn,
you are my gritty, witty city kitty.

92
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,382
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.

93
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,760
Things are so crazy
for me right now. I--

94
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,513
Don't give me that, you want crazy.
"Crazy" is your favorite Patsy Cline song

95
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,682
and your second favorite
Gnarls Barkley song.

96
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,809
I don't want crazy.

97
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,395
I've got five episodes
of <i>The Good Wife </i>piled up on my DVR,

98
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,898
and I just want a night off
to enjoy them.

99
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,777
Well, if that's how you feel, I guess
I could just go to Vanessa Gekko.

100
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,281
-[Carolyn] Gekko?!
-But I'd rather look at you all day.

101
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:26,243
You're an amazing agent.
And you're bright, and you're fun.

102
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,913
And I think we could make something
really special.

103
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,167
We weren't doing anything!
We were just looking for closet supplies.

104
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,628
Are you the person to talk to
about unclogging the toilet?

105
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,172
Stuart, I'm your boss.

106
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,382
Okay, but you're the one
in the janitor's closet, so...

107
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,885
-What, I'm the idiot?
-[sighs]

108
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,933
[Diane] <i>The first thing you notice</i>
<i>about Sebastian St. Clair</i>

109
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,601
<i>is that he speaks in paragraphs.</i>

110
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,146
Even I can't believe
how much good we've done here,

111
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,730
and I'll believe almost anything.

112
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,692
In the last six weeks,
we dug a new well, built a school,

113
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,695
and next month
the community center is doing <i>Seussical.</i>

114
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,904
There we go.

115
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,823
[Diane] <i>In his previous life,</i>
<i>Sebastian owned</i>

116
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,533
<i>a chain of high-end department stores.</i>

117
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,285
I want to stock up on muffs.

118
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,788
We're going to sell a lot of muffs
this winter. Huzzah!

119
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,000
Diane, I lived a life
of power and luxury,

120
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,960
and then my picture
was in the newspaper.

121
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,753
-A real-life newspaper!
-Uh-huh.

122
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,630
But I knew my life was empty.

123
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,633
<i>At night I heard the cries</i>
<i>of children sick and dying.</i>

124
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,426
<i>And I would scream into the night.</i>

125
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,013
Shut up! Shut up, children!

126
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,974
<i>But the phantom cries would not abate.</i>

127
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,726
And so I began my travels,

128
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,229
with little more than a compass,
a yearning for adventure,

129
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,105
and several crates full of unsold muffs.

130
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,483
I knew there were people out there
just waiting for my help.

131
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,527
Diane, this is Kinko.

132
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,695
I am Kinko.

133
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,113
In his language, it means,

134
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,866
orphan whose parents were murdered
by rebels and will die young,

135
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,408
probably from malaria.

136
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,078
Hi, Kinko. I'm Diane.

137
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,872
It means,
my parents liked the show <i>Cheers.</i>

138
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:58,252
<i>Cheers! </i>Oh, you're good.
You're very good.

139
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,295
[Diane] <i>When Sebastian St. Clair says</i>
<i>you're good,</i>

140
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,172
<i>you want to believe</i>
<i>that you really are.</i>

141
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,800
<i>That you, like Sebastian, are part</i>
<i>of something bigger than just yourself.</i>

142
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,221
<i>And for a moment,</i>
<i>you feel like you are.</i>

143
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,056
[Sebastian] Oh, Kinko made a mess.

144
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,604
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is
way more valuable than a Triple Crown.

145
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,647
And cut. Neat.

146
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,775
-Let's break for lunch.
-[kids] Oh!

147
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,195
Kelsey, this is a nightmare.

148
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,240
I had to touch three children today,
and one of them was sticky.

149
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,575
Yeah, it was you.
Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.

150
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,412
-BoJack, there's nothing we can do.
-No, this isn't you.

151
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,080
I've seen everything you've done.

152
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,665
Your films are challenging and gritty,
and they're great.

153
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,043
I'm not just saying that
because they're full of lesbians.

154
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,545
Look, even if I wanted to finish
that Nixon scene,

155
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,672
we don't have an Oval Office set.

156
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,674
There's one at the Nixon Library
in Yorba Linda.

157
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,635
Why on earth do you know that?

158
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,012
In season three of <i>Horsin' Around,</i>
the horse got elected president

159
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,389
and we shot on location.

160
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,350
We can sneak into the library
and get the shot, guerilla-style.

161
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,935
Once Turteltaub sees it,
he'll love it,

162
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,479
and we can make the movie
we both want to make.

163
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,605
[sighs]

164
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,817
-Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.
-All right!

165
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,278
Did they really make
your character president?

166
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,362
Only for season three.

167
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,739
In season four, it turned out
it was all a dream.

168
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,992
They called my airplane <i>Air Horse One.</i>

169
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,744
And the vice president was
a hip-hop zebra named Zebro.

170
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,621
-Come on.
-It wasn't our best season.

171
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,999
But on the bright side,
was not our worst.

172
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,877
<i>Step one, we go to the Nixon Library...</i>

173
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,921
<i>and steal the scale model.</i>

174
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,090
[man as Nixon] Welcome to my library.

175
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,343
I'm Nixon. [chuckles].

176
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,054
[in normal voice] Yeah, you know,
some people say I look like Nixon.

177
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,850
Not because he's my dad or anything.
That's crazy. Nixon's not my dad.

178
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,437
But if you have any questions about Nixon,
I'd be happy to answer them.

179
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,023
Yeah, I have a question. Um...

180
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,651
Is that the lighted exit sign
from Nixon's boyhood home?

181
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,488
Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.

182
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,905
-Is that...
-Here we go.

183
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,075
...the handicapped drinking fountain
he used in the White House?

184
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,827
No, just a normal drinking fountain.

185
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,995
-Hang on.
-One more.

186
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,456
-Is that the smoke alarm--?
-No.

187
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,124
[chuckles nervously]

188
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,295
{\an8}So the Oval Office is right here,
next to the men's room.

189
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,382
{\an8}I remember because season three
of<i> Horsin' Around </i>was a big cocaine year.

190
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,175
{\an8}All the pressures of being president.

191
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,594
-I don't see how we'll pull this off.
-We're gonna need a crack team.

192
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,597
First, we gotta get
the best lock-pick in the city.

193
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,184
-Not interested.
-Okay.

194
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,061
<i>The second best lock-pick in the city.</i>

195
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,021
-No way I'm doing that.
-Got it.

196
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,147
<i>A lock-pick.</i>

197
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,565
Todd, can you pick locks?

198
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,650
-Kind of.
-Great. You're in.

199
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,277
<i>We'll need an expert cat burglar.</i>

200
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,571
All right, <i>Good Wife,</i>
let's see what you got.

201
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,198
[BoJack] Hey, Princess Carolyn!

202
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,992
Kelsey and I are gonna break
into the Nixon library

203
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,661
to steal a shot
for our Secretariat movie.

204
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:43,666
It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper
that stands to benefit you in no way.

205
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,834
Are you in?

206
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,669
[man] Hey! Shut up down there!

207
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,255
-[BoJack] You shut up!
-[man] Make me!

208
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,757
[BoJack] Hey, you got a problem?
Take it up with my agent,

209
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,842
your downstairs neighbor
Princess Carolyn.

210
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:53,927
[groans]

211
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,513
[BoJack]
<i>We'll need someone to play Checkers.</i>

212
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,224
Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.

213
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,685
What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Da Bears.

214
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,438
BoJack, I'd love to help you out,

215
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,273
but I'm super-busy recording promos

216
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,483
for television's
highest-rated new game show.

217
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,694
-We can probably do it without you.
-This next one's for Seattle.

218
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,864
Hey, Seattle! Space Needle, Starbucks.

219
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,410
What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Rain.

220
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,788
It's too bad though because I could
really bring a lot to this project.

221
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:25,083
The more I think about it,
Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.

222
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,751
It's just a single on Secretariat.

223
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,671
Hey, Waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.
What does Ethan Hawke know?

224
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,134
-We'll find out tonight. So sorry.
-You know what? Forget I even asked.

225
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,803
-Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.
-Okay.

226
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,431
<i>Finally, we'll need a criminal mastermind.</i>

227
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,809
Character actress Margo Martindale,
you've been a model prisoner.

228
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,603
I'm glad I served my time.

229
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,646
But now I'm ready to move on with my life

230
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,440
and get back to doing small roles

231
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,067
in critically-acclaimed films
and television shows.

232
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,988
[prison guard] Watch, purse, lipstick,

233
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,782
Emmy Award
for Best Guest Actress.

234
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,744
[sighs deeply]

235
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,206
I need your help with a break-in.

236
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,209
BoJack, I've been out of prison
for two minutes.

237
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,003
What took you so long?

238
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,879
[tires squealing]

239
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,635
Kelsey, Mr. Peanutbutter and I
are gonna break into the library.

240
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,720
But the problem is,
the place is crawling with cops.

241
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,139
They're on high alert

242
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,392
because some idiot
stole this model last night.

243
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,727
Yeah, nice work, Todd.

244
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,857
[laughs] Who am I kidding?
I can't stay mad at you. You're adorable.

245
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,735
Look at your big saucer eyes.
I can go swimming in them!

246
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,280
-Totally.
-Now, we need to lose the cops.

247
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,199
The rest of you will create a diversion

248
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:43,286
by breaking into the only other place
in Yorba Linda of cultural significance:

249
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,788
the Discount Fine Art Gallery
in the strip mall,

250
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,208
between the tanning salon
and the adult bookstore.

251
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,793
Once you set off the alarm,
all the cops will go there.

252
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,588
[mimicking siren wails and engine revving]

253
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:57,551
Now, things could get ugly.
One of you is very likely to die.

254
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,387
-Possibly Alan.
-Why possibly Alan?

255
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,639
Well, you are the guy
none of us knows that well.

256
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,474
I just came to fix your cable.

257
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,726
Alan, you already know too much.
You're a part of this now, like it or not.

258
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,271
-But--
-Hey, you think you could keep it down?

259
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,191
I'm reading a script
and I'm having trouble focusing,

260
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,527
so now my notes are
gonna be confusing and vague.

261
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,444
We're almost done.

262
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,405
I know you're having fun
with your police cars,

263
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,782
I just wish you would have asked
before you invited these people over.

264
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,118
-I live here, too.
-You're right. I'm sorry.

265
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,954
And can you at least let Alan
fix the cable before he dies?

266
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:30,542
I can't die. I'm endangered!

267
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,170
[Diane] "And the truffle-infused gnocchi
was the star dish

268
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,298
at this up-and-comer that will please
the pickiest of Brooklynites

269
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,008
and the less discerning Staten Islander."

270
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,886
When I grow up, I can be food critic
for <i>New Yorker?</i>

271
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,013
You can do anything you want in life.

272
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,764
Not everyone can write for <i>The New Yorker,</i>

273
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,766
but there's always <i>The Atlantic.</i>

274
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,143
[Sebastian] Diane,

275
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,689
I'm concerned you're spending
a lot of time with this sickly child.

276
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,774
Remember, you're supposed
to be writing about me.

277
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,612
Sure, but isn't this why we're here?
To help these people?

278
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,572
I'm here to help these people.

279
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,033
You're here to help me help them
by writing a book about me

280
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,245
so people back home will give money
to my foundation.

281
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,538
Great.

282
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,210
Okay, come on. Over here. Get it.

283
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,130
[alarm wailing]

284
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,507
We're in. It's too late to turn back now.

285
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:23,386
One of us isn't going
to come out of this alive.

286
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,179
Why do you all keep saying that?

287
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,600
Why can't we all assume we're gonna
make it out alive and go from there?

288
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:32,103
Alan, we've got enough problems without
worrying about your imminent death.

289
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,980
Can't we just all shut up and do this?

290
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,358
Why does everything have to be
a big, complicated mess?

291
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,486
Like,
look at this Thomas Kinkade painting.

292
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,945
It's simple.

293
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,616
And serene. And... pleasant.

294
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,992
[sighs]

295
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,246
I think that the vest
makes me look kind of chunky.

296
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,625
I don't do CrossFit five days a week
to not look sweet in this uniform.

297
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,628
I swear to God,
if you don't shut up about CrossFit--

298
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,588
[woman over radio]
<i>Break-in at the Discount</i>

299
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,214
<i>Fine Art Gallery at the strip mall.</i>

300
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,926
Let's roll!
That's a thing we say at CrossFit.

301
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,428
[police sirens wailing]

302
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,775
[BoJack shouts]

303
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,069
Remember when my character
on <i>Mr. Peanutbutter's House </i>was

304
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:25,323
-elected president?
-Let me guess, it was all a dream?

305
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,575
No, I served half a term,
then resigned

306
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,828
because when Zachary
had a bad time with peer pressure,

307
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,079
I realized I was spending
too much time being president

308
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,790
and not enough time being a dad.

309
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,750
It's like you didn't even watch my show.

310
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,503
Okay, I'd like you here.

311
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,755
And then you are going to be over here.

312
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,716
-Freeze!
-I'm union.

313
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,676
-Playing dead.
-Breaking and entering?

314
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,178
That is against everything
Nixon stood for.

315
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,390
We didn't mean to cause trouble.
We're trying to make a movie about Nixon.

316
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,976
Yeah? What, another leftist screed
about how corrupt he was?

317
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,353
-Uh...
-Or is it about how he had

318
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,396
an illegitimate son,

319
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,024
and the son never knew who his dad was,
but always had a hunch it was Nixon,

320
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,820
and then that son grew up to be
the security guard at the Nixon Library?

321
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,363
The second one?

322
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,116
Well, if that's true, how come you don't
have an actor here to play Nixon?

323
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,827
Because...

324
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,122
we couldn't find anyone who could
appropriately capture his magic.

325
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,208
You know, I do a pretty good Nixon.

326
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,210
You? No way.

327
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,754
[as Nixon] Hello, I'm Nixon.

328
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,965
I can't be at your soccer game, but I am
your father and I love you very much.

329
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,551
Oh, my God. He's perfect.

330
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,094
We've found our Nixon.

331
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,137
[in normal voice] I can be ready in five.

332
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,598
Uh. Did we get the shot?

333
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,894
It's so peaceful.

334
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,521
-Okay, folks.
-[all] Aah!

335
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,107
Party's over.
That's something we say at CrossFit.

336
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,568
Ugh. Wait a sec-- I know you!

337
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,070
You were in <i>Justified.</i>
You were amazing.

338
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,405
Okay, you caught me.

339
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,199
I am kind of
a well-known character actress.

340
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,202
I am such a huge fan, Miss, uh--

341
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,495
What--? What's your name?

342
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,330
Sure, of course.

343
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,917
Everyone loves my work,
but apparently not enough

344
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,335
to watch the credits
and find out what my name is.

345
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,714
The important thing is that we enjoy
your great performances, right?

346
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,884
-How about you enjoy this? Aah!
-[both] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

347
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,303
Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.

348
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,556
Oh, is that what we agreed to?
I thought we said "no gum."

349
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,600
But you're also chewing gum.

350
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,769
I'm a wild card.

351
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,354
-Aah!
-Return fire!

352
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,731
Watch out!

353
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,358
Oh, no! Alan's dead!

354
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,027
No, I'm fine.
The bullet hit my cell phone.

355
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,239
Oh, no! Alan's cell phone is dead!

356
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,451
Nope, phone's fine, too.
Oh, hey, I got a text from my wife.

357
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,370
She's going into labor.
Guys, I'm gonna be a dad!

358
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,831
See you later!

359
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,750
-[police sirens wailing]
-[guns cocking]

360
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,546
Die, you chunky assholes!

361
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,841
See, Jeff?
This is what I'm talking about.

362
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,091
[all shouting]

363
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,844
[cop] Shoot!

364
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,557
Oh.

365
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:05,316
-How could this be any more perfect?
-[sing-song] Yoo-hoo.

366
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,819
Vanessa Gekko.
How did you get in this painting?

367
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,320
I'm your servant, of course.

368
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,156
In your infinite generosity,
you gave me this job

369
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,742
when it became clear
that I don't have what it takes

370
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,744
to be a "Hollywoo" power-agent.

371
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,245
Also, my husband left me.

372
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,833
And my children married each other
in an unholy incestuous union.

373
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,502
Plus, I have, like, colitis or something.

374
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,213
How appropriate!
Fetch me drink, wench.

375
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,173
-Right away, ma'am.
-Ah.

376
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:31,885
Diane...

377
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,013
[Diane] <i>The second thing you notice</i>
<i>about Sebastian St. Clair</i>

378
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,097
<i>is how much he talks about himself.</i>

379
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,683
This way is the library I built.

380
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,352
And over there is the statue
of me building the library.

381
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,564
And on that wall is a painting
of me posing for the statue.

382
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,901
-Put a chapter in your book about that.
-Uh-huh.

383
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,612
[Diane] <i>The only respite</i>
<i>from his constant bombast is sleep,</i>

384
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,406
<i>and even then, sometimes...</i>

385
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,824
[bomb whistling, explodes]

386
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,826
-[Diane gasps]
-[people scream nearby]

387
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,163
Everybody--
Those of you who can walk, I mean.

388
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,625
--let's drag these corpses
to the mass grave behind the playground.

389
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,545
We need to make room
for my new hospital.

390
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,757
-Where's Kinko? Is he okay?
-Oh, no, no, he's certainly dead.

391
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,175
See, Diane,
I told you not to make friends.

392
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,636
Jesus, you don't care
about any of these people.

393
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,973
You're just using them as props
for your big-shot superhero act.

394
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,642
Diane, the dead will not benefit
from our grief,

395
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:26,272
but the survivors need a new hospital
and we need to build it.

396
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,481
This is too much.

397
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,609
If you're going to survive,
you'll need to harden up.

398
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,528
I asked you to join me
because I thought you could handle it.

399
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,948
-But if you can't, you can go home.
-I...

400
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:36,991
I can handle it.

401
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,244
Great! Let's drag some bodies!
Kinko! Oh, never mind.

402
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,999
Hey, um, how come Nixon gets a line
and I don't get a line?

403
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,126
We only gave him a line
so he wouldn't call the police.

404
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:51,714
-If I call the police, will I get a line?
-No, we won't use it in the movie.

405
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,424
We only need the one-shot of me.

406
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,010
I just think if he gets a line,
I should get a line.

407
00:18:56,094 --> 00:19:00,139
-Ugh. Actors.
-Okay, positions everyone. And... action.

408
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,265
[as Nixon] I'm Nixon.

409
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,102
The way you're feeling
about your dead brother is how I feel

410
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,353
about the son I'll never know.

411
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:11,734
But I look at the moon and so does he.
That's how I know we're connected.

412
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,193
And I'm Checkers.

413
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,779
[Kelsey] All right, so, BoJack,

414
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,197
you've been told
that your brother, Jeffretariat,

415
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,827
the one Nixon sent to Vietnam
in your place, is dead.

416
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,870
You're feeling the weight of that guilt.

417
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,331
And the tears start to flow.

418
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,708
And the tears start to flow.

419
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,044
Oh. I don't cry in front of other people.

420
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,464
Well, you need to.
This is the emotional climax of the movie.

421
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,926
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front
of other people. I can't.

422
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,218
Really, never? Come on.

423
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,513
What if someone tells you
they'll take you to the park,

424
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,182
and they keep talking about the park
and all the fun you'll have,

425
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,433
but then... [sobs]

426
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,603
But then they don't take you to the park.
I need a second.

427
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,607
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.
I didn't know you wanted me to cry.

428
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,567
Can you give us the room, please?

429
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,196
There's a park right outside
we can hang out at.

430
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,949
-Oh!
-Oh, we can't, the sprinklers are on.

431
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,075
Ah.

432
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:08,082
Well, another beautiful, serene day
in magical fantasy-painting world.

433
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,542
[sighs]

434
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,712
Queen Princess Carolyn, if I may,
I have some exciting news.

435
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,421
I just landed a new client.

436
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,840
-The mill owner!
-Huh?

437
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,425
We're doing a three-picture deal
about his waterwheel.

438
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,469
-Wait, you're making deals here?
-I'll say.

439
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,473
I'm now the biggest agent
in the entire idyllic New England village.

440
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,727
It's like you don't even read
the idyllic New England village trades.

441
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,978
What? No!

442
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,606
You're polluting my perfect serene
dream life. Why is this happening?

443
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,192
I don't know. It's your fantasy.

444
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,153
But if you ask me, I don't think
you want perfect and serene

445
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,446
and enough time to catch up
on <i>The Good Wife.</i>

446
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,365
Stop kidding yourself,
Princess Carolyn.

447
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,369
If you really wanted the simple life,
you'd have a simple life.

448
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,788
Oh, my God. I gotta get out of here.

449
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,957
[sing-song] Bye!

450
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,669
Hey. Yeah, I got rid of her.
Now this place is all mine.

451
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,504
Get your demo guys together.

452
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,258
Let's tear this old Tudor down
and put up some condos! [chuckles]

453
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,468
Okay.

454
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,262
[Margo laughing]

455
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,890
This isn't just for me.

456
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,893
It's for John Carroll Lynch,
C.C.H. Pounder,

457
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:13,397
and all the other character actors
who live in lucrative obscurity.

458
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,025
The blood I spill today is for us all!

459
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:20,196
I'm character actress Margo Martindale!
[chuckles]

460
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,909
Yeah, I'm going to go
with Princess Carolyn.

461
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,994
[laughing and grunting]

462
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,288
Hmm.

463
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,957
[cell phone ringtone]

464
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,917
-Hello?
-Hey.

465
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,544
There you are!
I've been trying to call you all week.

466
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,131
-Yeah, the coverage in Cordovia is--
<i>-Diane, Diane.</i>

467
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,757
Listen, I gotta tell you:

468
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,551
I'm sorry I gave you such
a hard time about your trip.

469
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,972
The truth is,
I really am so proud of you.

470
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,598
<i>A lot of people talk big,</i>

471
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,934
<i>but you're actually out there</i>
<i>helping people.</i>

472
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,393
<i>You're the real deal, Diane.</i>

473
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,938
-Yeah...
-How is it there? Is it amazing?

474
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,065
It's... good.

475
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,194
It's hard, but it's good.

476
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,279
I miss you.

477
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,447
I miss you, too, but I promise,

478
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,992
these six months are gonna fly by.

479
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,744
Yeah. How's the game show going?

480
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,665
Oh, shit, I completely forgot I'm supposed
to be hosting a game show right now.

481
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,126
[upbeat dance music playing]

482
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,922
[caws]

483
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,548
I gotta go.

484
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,717
[Diane] <i>And that's when you realize</i>

485
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,386
<i>that the book you've been writing</i>
<i>in your head</i>

486
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,766
<i>is never actually going to be a book,</i>
<i>so you stop--</i>

487
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,771
I know what you're gonna say.

488
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,108
I'm a dumb sitcom actor
who's in over his head.

489
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,819
I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.

490
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,863
And I'm sorry I made you come here.

491
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,532
I'm sorry for everything.
I don't know what I'm doing.

492
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,242
BoJack, sit down.

493
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,409
[sighs]

494
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:53,914
You've just been told your brother is dead
and that it's your fault.

495
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,666
But this moment is bigger than that.

496
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,003
This is the moment
that Secretariat stops running.

497
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,630
Because this is the moment you realize

498
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:07,261
something inside you is broken,
and it can never be fixed.

499
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:10,973
We got it.

500
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,474
Really? I didn't cry.

501
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,144
You didn't have to.
Turteltaub's gonna love this.

502
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:18,772
-Oh. All right.
-Thanks for talking me into this.

503
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:23,361
Just so you know, I'm really glad
we're making this movie together.

504
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,323
-Didn't know I had it in me, did you?
-No, I knew.

505
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,866
Huh.

506
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,834
[crying]

507
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,011
-Hold the elevator, please.
-Coming in?

508
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,513
-I'm all in.
-Whoa!

509
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,687
Mommy, it's nearly Christmas.
Where's Uncle Secretariat?

510
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,774
He had to go win a race
against the Russians.

511
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,860
But maybe, if he runs really fast...

512
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,196
-Hey, where's Kelsey?
-Oh, yeah, funny story.

513
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,615
Turns out you two knuckleheads
snuck out last night

514
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,118
and got that shot
I told you not to get for the scene

515
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,078
-that's not in the movie anymore.
-Uh...

516
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,914
Silly me, I didn't like that.
So I fired her ass.

517
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,832
-What?
-We got a movie to finish, okay?

518
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,209
So, go get in costume,

519
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,544
get your butt up that chimney,
and do your thing, Hamlet.

520
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:27,591
Just maybe,
all we have to do is believe!

521
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,842
[slurping]

522
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,394
What are you doing here?

523
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:42,356
Hey, is it cool if I crash here
for a couple nights?

524
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,276
I didn't know where else to go.
