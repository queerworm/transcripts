00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,931
-I know, I know.
-I'm just glad you showed up.

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,850
The waitstaff was starting
to get suspicious.

4
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,060
See? I'm not a liar! I do have a wife!

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,772
-All right. You're trying to embarrass me.
-And I did. And now I'm fine.

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,858
-Hi, you.
-Hi, you. [kisses]

7
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,234
Long day at the office?

8
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,986
-I lost them, Indira.
-No.

9
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,196
In all my years of corporate mediation,

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,700
I've never been unable to resolve
a dispute before it goes to arbitration.

11
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,994
I'm Mary-Beth, the Mediating Maven.

12
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,538
I'm sure you helped them
in ways you'll never even know.

13
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:42,417
-I-- Don't therapize me.
-[chuckles] But you're so easy!

14
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,377
You make me feel like
I'm actually good at it.

15
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,545
What's going on with you?

16
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,172
-It's been a tough week.
-Tell me.

17
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,089
Mm...

18
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,759
-I shouldn't talk about my clients.
-Come on.

19
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,887
What if you changed all the names
and identifying characteristics?

20
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,140
Okay. This is a story about...

21
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:02,854
Bo... Bo... BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.

22
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,939
[theme music playing]

23
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,661
-[writing]
-[Indira] <i>So, it all started on Monday.</i>

24
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,496
<i>I was in a session with Diane--</i>

25
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,789
<i>...a! Diana.</i>

26
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,833
[Mary-Beth] <i>Like Diana,</i>
<i>Princess of Whales?</i>

27
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,000
[Indira] <i>Exactly.</i>

28
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,044
It's just so tough
being Princess of Whales.

29
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,088
Like, I can't be all things to all whales.

30
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,339
-You're deflecting.
-I'm not!

31
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,007
Let's talk about the BoBo tape.

32
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,259
{\an8}What's the BoBo tape?

33
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,928
{\an8}She recently came into possession
of an audiotape

34
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,181
{\an8}of her friend and co-worker,
BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.

35
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:24,561
[BoBo] <i>On the boat. There was a girl.</i>
<i>In New Mexico.</i>

36
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,857
{\an8}<i>And she trusted me. Also, I'm a zebra.</i>

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,317
{\an8}-What girl is he talking about?
-I don't know.

38
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,697
{\an8}"Girl" sounds young, right? [scoffs]
Whatever it is, it's gotta be bad,

39
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,449
{\an8}because, otherwise,
why wouldn't he tell me?

40
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,077
{\an8}Diana, you are not responsible
for the dysfunction of others.

41
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,996
{\an8}I actually explore this in my book,

42
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,123
<i>Are You Responsible</i>
<i>For The Dysfunction of Others?</i>

43
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,749
Spoiler alert: You're not!

44
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,211
I just wish I could talk to him about it,
but he's like an open sore.

45
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:54,048
{\an8}Attention! As some of you
might have heard, my mom died recently.

46
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,300
I know you're very concerned,

47
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,468
but I wanna let you know
it will not affect my work.

48
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:01,222
I'm here, and I'm doing fine.
I just want to focus on the show.

49
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,225
{\an8}So, please treat this like any other day,
and be extra-nice to me

50
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,478
{\an8}because I am a famous actor,
not because my mom died.

51
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,023
{\an8}[all murmuring]

52
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,232
Thank you. Good.

53
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,861
{\an8}Yes, that's what I'm looking for.
Just go about your business.

54
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,030
{\an8}That's good 'cause I don't want to talk
about my mom.

55
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,073
Hmm. [grunts]

56
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,952
-Hey. Did you hear my mom died?
-Yeah. But you don't wanna talk about it.

57
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,079
No. Pretty weird she died, though, huh?

58
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,583
-Do you want to talk about it?
-No. I'm just saying it's weird.

59
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,170
-BoBo. I am so sorry.
-And I so don't wanna talk about it.

60
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,298
Obsessed with my mom much?
You're the one with issues.

61
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,507
Uh...

62
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,510
{\an8}I feel like he wants me to comfort him,
but I'm still angry.

63
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,971
{\an8}Maybe you could both use some space
from each other.

64
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,349
{\an8}Why don't you tell him you need
to focus on your work?

65
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,559
{\an8}What work?
Flippy won't let me do anything.

66
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,770
[dolphin voice]

67
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,397
Flippy? Are you okay?

68
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,899
{\an8}[squeaking]

69
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,990
Hey, what are we filming today?
Why is there a submarine set?

70
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,909
{\an8}[squeaking continues]

71
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,827
[Diana] Interior sub?

72
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,706
{\an8}Why didn't you just write "way"?

73
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:15,213
Okay. So, now we just need
to come up with a scene

74
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,798
that takes place in a submarine.

75
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,596
Okay.

76
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,600
-Ah!
-Did you hear my mom died?

77
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,936
[Indira] How about this?
If he wants to talk,

78
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,354
and you aren't can't confront him,

79
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,773
tell him your<i> therapist</i> says
you need space.

80
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,652
That's where I went wrong.
I inserted myself into her story.

81
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,822
Don't beat yourself up.
Remember what Doctor Janet said?

82
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,032
[bells in accordance to stick]

83
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,328
Tell me about your day.
You had a tough workplace mediation?

84
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,291
Whoo! The problem with these two
is they don't just work together.

85
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,042
They also live together.

86
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,920
[grunting]

87
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,297
What a beautiful morning!

88
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,798
[Indira] Wait, wait,, wait. Hold on.

89
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:03,511
If your story can have Princess Diana,
why can't mine have Emperor Finger-Face?

90
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,889
It's not actually Princess Diana.
She's just named Diana.

91
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,599
I've been picturing Princess Diana.

92
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,936
Okay, fine. Tell me what happened
with Emperor Finger-Face.

93
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,108
He lived in the same apartment
as a Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning

94
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,609
in the shape of a woman.

95
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,278
Good morning, Emperor Finger-Face!

96
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,073
Good morning to you,
Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning!

97
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,742
-See you tonight?
-Afternoon.

98
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,578
I wanna talk to you,
so I set a meeting through your assistant.

99
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,164
-Have you seen my keys?
-Butter tray in the fridge.

100
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,083
I think I put them there
during one of my night terrors.

101
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,128
I don't have time to go to the kitchen.
I'll just hotwire my car.

102
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,590
-Hey, did you eat breakfast?
-No time for meals.

103
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,800
I just grab whatever I can,
whenever I can.

104
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,801
Hold on.

105
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,219
I know you're a gal on the go,

106
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,556
but even tangled fogs of pulsating
yearning need to eat right.

107
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,058
I'll get something on set.

108
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,810
Pinky swear? [horn] Ow! I poked my face!

109
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,104
I feel I'm having a hard time
following the story

110
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,065
because of how weird
you made the characters.

111
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,901
The important thing is that these two
have been living together

112
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,403
for almost a year with virtually no drama.

113
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,948
In some ways, it's the most functional
relationship either have ever been in!

114
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,201
Oh, okay. I guess that's not that weird.

115
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,912
Great! Now, back to the story
of the fog and the hand!

116
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,665
-So. What can I do you for?
-I have no workspace on set.

117
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,836
I was hoping we could allocate some money
to get me an office.

118
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,548
Oh, look, here's the exact paperwork
you need all filled out and ready to go.

119
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,092
-Okay.
-Just needs your signature.

120
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,636
-Let me retrieve my pen.
-Marvelous!

121
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,431
Yep, I am currently gripping my pen
inside my jacket.

122
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,310
Now to just pull it out
and sign this document.

123
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,395
Just goes to show,

124
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,772
you get what you need
if you pull the right strings.

125
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:38,981
Strings?

126
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,692
-[gasps] It was you!
-What was me?

127
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:46,197
The last string cheese in the apartment,
I was saving it. And you took it!

128
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,825
And now you want me to give you an office?

129
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,785
What?! I didn't take your cheese.

130
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,497
Uh-oh, are we having
a work-related conflict?

131
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,793
This feels like more of a
you-crashing-on-my-couch-related conflict.

132
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,212
When I started here,
I signed a contract that said,

133
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:05,258
all intra-office disputes
must be resolved via mediation,

134
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,678
or failing that, forced arbitration.

135
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,263
Ugh!

136
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,557
So, then I-- You're not eating.

137
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,601
I just-- I keep thinking
about BoBo the Zebra.

138
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,187
Okay, what happened next with BoBo?

139
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,689
Well, he wanted to get back to work,

140
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,109
but since Flippy had writer's block,
there was nothing for the actors to do.

141
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,902
How is there nothing to shoot?

142
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,156
So, what, I just have to wait around,
and be alone with my thoughts? Gross.

143
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,908
When I was on<i> The Murder-Stoppers.</i>
we had to shut down production

144
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,161
because Nick Nolte wouldn't come out
of his trailer.

145
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,455
He wasn't even on the show!
He was in one of our trailers,

146
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,124
-and we couldn't get him out!
-Is it hard to write a script, Gino?

147
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,460
"Oh, I'm Philbert, bang, bang.
I'm a tough guy.

148
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,212
My wife is dead! Did I kill her?
Who knows? I'm cool."

149
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,214
That was pretty good.
Can we just roll on that?

150
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,049
When there's something to shoot,
we'll shoot.

151
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,219
Meanwhile, you wanna go bang one out
in your trailer? I'll get my diaphragm.

152
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,638
Nah, I'd just be thinking about
my dead mom the whole time,

153
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,056
which would either ruin it or--

154
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,642
Oh, God, what if it makes it better?
I don't wanna know that.

155
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,769
-You want me to just get you some pie?
-No.

156
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,063
-Yes.
-Okay, big guy.

157
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,148
[BoBo sighs]

158
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,526
-[sympathetic voice] Hey, buddy.
-Hey, Mr. Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread.

159
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,195
Really sorry about your mom.

160
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,405
No, it's fine. I'm fine. It's really fine.

161
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,992
It must be so hard to lose a loved one.
I, for one, never have.

162
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,494
You've never lost a loved one?

163
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,205
-When my mom got old, she moved to a farm.
-What?

164
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,832
In the country, where she could have
plenty of room to run free.

165
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,751
Why would she wanna run around
if she's old?

166
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,794
You know,
I never really questioned the logic.

167
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,214
My brother set it up.
I haven't been able to visit,

168
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,633
but everyone in my family
goes to that farm eventually.

169
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,094
-Oh, dude, your mom's dead.
-What? No. She's at a farm.

170
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,597
After a prolonged bout of Parkinson's.
A farm.

171
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,475
Where they don't have telephones,
or the internet, and... Oh, my God.

172
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,810
She's dead. My mom is dead!

173
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,270
-[sobbing]
-Whoa!

174
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,438
[BoBo groans]

175
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,689
Oh, there... There, there.

176
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,857
[Flippy squeaking]

177
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,527
-What's going on with this submarine?
-My therapist doesn't want me

178
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,528
talking to you!

179
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,197
-What?
-My therapist, Dr. Indira,

180
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,783
says it would be good
if you gave me some space.

181
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,160
-Why would she say that?
-Don't know. I'm just the client.

182
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,621
-Her call, not mine. I should go.
-Uh...

183
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,124
Everybody? My dear mother
has transcended this plane.

184
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,876
-[all] Aw.
-I am incredibly fragile

185
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,920
and could use all the support I can get,

186
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,256
so if everyone could pay
a lot of attention to me,

187
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,424
and ask me a lot of questions
about my mother,

188
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,260
and maybe tell me stories
about your mothers,

189
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,470
I think that would really make me
feel a lot better.

190
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,055
Sure, Mr. Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread!

191
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,100
-[man] So sorry for your loss.
-This is a very healthy way to grieve.

192
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,017
-[applause]
-Ugh.

193
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,438
So, a brief recapitulation:

194
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,692
this is not a room
for repudiation or condemnation

195
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,528
over string cheese
appropriation accusations.

196
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:34,323
Mediation is an invitation
for open conversation,

197
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,827
frustration de-escalation,
and exchange of information,

198
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,287
which, in summation,

199
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,374
removes any justification for litigation
involving this corporation.

200
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,585
Nobody was going to litigate anything.

201
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,462
That's fabulous,
because you legally cannot.

202
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,674
Now, tell me about your journey
into the woods of conflict.

203
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,219
Well, this very Wednesday, October 24th,

204
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:59,807
I was excited to come home
to some string cheese. The very last one.

205
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,726
I'd been saving it all week.

206
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,145
-All week until Wednesday?
-That is correct.

207
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,564
I measure my weeks Thursday to Wednesday.

208
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,899
-Why would you--
-Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning?

209
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,818
Emperor Finger-Face has the floor.

210
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,986
I was gonna melt it down

211
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,697
and then sculpt it
into a Mozzarella Cinderella!

212
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,034
But when I got home,
my string cheese was gone!

213
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,327
Doesn't mean I took it.

214
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,621
Tangled Fog, watch yourself.
Or I'll turn on this fan.

215
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,583
Well, this morning you said yourself
that when it comes to eating,

216
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,420
-you just grab whatever you can.
-Can we use "I" statements?

217
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,505
[shouts] Ai, ai, ai! You took my cheese!

218
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,258
You probably ate it yourself
during one of your night terrors!

219
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,761
We know you opened the fridge.
You put my keys in there.

220
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,471
I can't eat while I'm terrified.

221
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,642
That's why I'll never know
the delicious crunch of Count Chocula.

222
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,810
-[shudders]
-That still doesn't mean I took it.

223
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,729
-You will both have a chance to--
-Come on!

224
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,358
We both know you drift around
the apartment like you own the place.

225
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,985
-It's my apartment!
-[shouts and thumps] And it's my cheese!

226
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,236
Oh, boy.

227
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,363
[tires screech]

228
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,908
-[grunts] Who do you think you are?
-[gasps] Uh...

229
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,660
-I'm Dr. Indir--
-I know who you are!

230
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,912
You know how many therapists
there are named Indira?

231
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,122
Google filled in your last name for me.

232
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,375
Why did you tell Diana
that she needed space from me?

233
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,751
Would you like to have a seat?

234
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,420
No, I don't wanna "have a seat,"
and here's why.

235
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,464
Therapists are manipulative leeches...

236
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,470
So, when Jerry Lewis
mistook me for the valet,

237
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,682
he was carrying so much pain
I could never fathom.

238
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,100
-Mm...
-And that realization

239
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:28,145
allows me to forgive.
Not for his sake, but for mine.

240
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,231
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow. How long was I talking?

241
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,317
I hope that was cathartic for you.
You wanna come back same time tomorrow?

242
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:38,489
Wait a minute, I see what's going on here.
Are you... my new best friend?

243
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,949
[sighs] Uh...?

244
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,120
Ugh, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm hogging
all the conversation.

245
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,455
There's definitely more to your story
than mine.

246
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,209
Mine's more like a secondary story.
A B-story, if you will.

247
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,753
I have a feeling it will continue
to offer a light alternative,

248
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,839
as my story gets increasingly serious.

249
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,717
Let's continue to switch back and forth
between our stories,

250
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,677
pausing at their most interesting moments.

251
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,179
That feels like the most natural way
to have a conversation.

252
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,056
Well, while I was talking to BoBo,

253
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,933
Diana was trying to keep things together

254
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,435
-on set.
-I thought it was my turn.

255
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,480
-[gasps] Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
-[Diana] Okay, cut?

256
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,358
-[buzzer blares]
-Why is Sassy saying "Oh, my God?"

257
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,277
I just figured,
we've got all these people here,

258
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,778
we might as well film some stuff.

259
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,656
Presumably something shocking will happen,
and then if it does,

260
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,200
we have a shot of you saying,
[mimics Gino] "Oh, my God!"

261
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,202
-Makes sense.
-Diana, can I talk to you for a sec?

262
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,705
I know you're going through something,
and need boundaries,

263
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,123
but this isn't personal,

264
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,374
-it's about the show.
-Ah!

265
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,084
[Diana grunts, sighs] What is it?

266
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,544
I lied. It's a 100% personal.

267
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,379
-What?
-But it's good! You're gonna like this.

268
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,131
-Remember you said you needed space?
-Yes.

269
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,216
When you told me that,
I didn't take it well.

270
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,718
-Uh...
-But I made a new friend,

271
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,012
-so everything is good now.
-Oh. Well, that's great.

272
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,930
I'm glad you think so because, fun twist,

273
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,182
-it's Dr. Indira.
-What?

274
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,059
I'm seeing Dr. Indira now, as a friend.
Dr. Indira's my new friend.

275
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,102
-No.
-What?

276
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,063
It's great that you would wanna talk
to someone, and you should!

277
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,108
But she's mine.
I really need her to just be mine.

278
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,986
-Can you understand that?
-[sighs] Yeah.

279
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,910
Diana asked me not to be friends with you,
so out of respect for her,

280
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:10,206
I think it's best that I continue
seeing you behind her back.

281
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,167
We can still do our lunchtime hang outs,
but to cover our tracks,

282
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,169
I'll compensate you
for your time on the books.

283
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,629
Ιt'll seem as if you have a client.

284
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,548
And, to be safe, we should invoke
a therapist-to-friend confidentiality.

285
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,466
How's that sound?

286
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,514
So, in my dreams, I'm Philbert,
and sometimes when I wake up,

287
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,808
I don't know if I'm Philbert or if I'm me,

288
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,726
-or if I'm still dreaming.
-[watch beeping]

289
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,479
Oh, that's our time of friendship hour.

290
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:37,107
I'm just so glad that I can help break up
your day of listening to whiny babies

291
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,151
with some entertaining lunchtime convo.

292
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,695
Should I have told him
what we were doing was therapy?

293
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,948
On some level, he must have known
what was going on.

294
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,199
What I don't understand is,

295
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,785
if you knew Diana asked him
not to see you--

296
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,121
I'm a therapist. A doctor heals.
A DJ spins.

297
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,750
Jessica Chastain takes whatever gig
Amy Adams says no to.

298
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,126
My job is to listen.

299
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,337
And at that moment,
BoBo needed someone to listen.

300
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,630
I know the feeling.

301
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,425
Okay, we've been going back and forth
for two hours.

302
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,804
Can we take a break?
I gotta use the bathroom. If I even can!

303
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,057
Maybe it's just another hand down there!
Guess I'll find out!

304
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,601
Why not just say you took the cheese?

305
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,770
-Because I didn't.
-You want an office, right?

306
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,065
There's nothing wrong with telling
a small lie to avoid a fight.

307
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,861
I do it all the time with my wife,
Doctor, uh, Underwear.

308
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,239
-Heh?
-I love your new hairstyle, honey.

309
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:30,160
-Did you not like my new hairstyle?
-Oh! Um... Back to my story...

310
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,788
All you have to do
is tell Emperor Finger-Face

311
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,081
what he wants to hear.

312
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,710
Fifty-nine cents worth of edible string
for a brand-new office?

313
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,878
Wouldn't you take that deal?

314
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:43,966
So, turns out I can use the bathroom,
but it comes out in tiny cubes!

315
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,677
Hey. I took the string cheese.

316
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,512
Ha, ha! I knew it!

317
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,683
Wonderful. So, she can replace the cheese
and you'll give her an office. We did it!

318
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,768
Great! Let me just grab my pen.

319
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:59,023
-But even if I did take the cheese--
-Which you just admitted you did!

320
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,065
Would I be in the wrong?

321
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,110
I mean, it is kind of a "fair game food,"
don't you think?

322
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,029
-What?
-It's not like it's a sandwich.

323
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,448
Some foods are just widely understood
to be up for grabs.

324
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,033
-No. You guys.
-[Finger-Face] Okay.

325
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,994
Well, then let's make a list
of fair game foods.

326
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:17,291
Grapes. Fair game. Eggs. Fair game.
An unsliced pie. Not fair game.

327
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:21,921
A sliced pie. Fair game.
The last slice. Not fair game.

328
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,299
Then let's also make a list
of what's fair game to me in my apartment.

329
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,594
Oh, that's right, everything,
you literal knucklehead.

330
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:33,223
Oh, ho-ho!
That's a solid diss coming from a gas.

331
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,559
Please, you two,
we can still reach an agreement.

332
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,687
I don't know. I think this might go
beyond simple mediation.

333
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,106
-No!
-Damn it, we're going to arbitration!

334
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,984
[shouts] <i>Nooooooooooo!</i>

335
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:49,865
Hey, Flippy. I got everyone saying,
"Oh, my God." How's it going in here?

336
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:55,287
"Interior sub. Philbert. Philbert.
Flap, flap, flippy, flap. Fart. Barf.

337
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,705
Barf me a river, fartbag."

338
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,290
{\an8}[squeaking]

339
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,376
What's going on in here?

340
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,710
{\an8}[squeaking continues]

341
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,172
If it relieves any pressure,

342
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,716
I don't know that everyone thinks
you're a brilliant genius.

343
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,678
I think we need to simplify.

344
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,681
Let's start with Fritz.
Is he a ghost or is he not a ghost?

345
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,850
Can't he just be a ghost?

346
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,147
So, why is Philbert seeing a ghost?
Maybe he feels haunted?

347
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,442
And Fritz represents that?
What is haunting Philbert?

348
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,823
That's great. But also...
Maybe something involving a submarine?

349
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,076
You keep thinking.

350
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,412
Hey, are we about to shoot something?

351
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,706
I'm meeting a friend for lunch.
You don't know her.

352
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,873
It's gonna be a while still.

353
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,585
Flippy is working through his "process."
And I am helping.

354
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,837
Sounds good. Just remember,

355
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,339
you are not responsible
for the dysfunction of others.

356
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,465
What?

357
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,217
I'm just saying don't let him
get you down.

358
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,678
Where did you hear that?
About the dysfunction of others?

359
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,139
I don't know. Just around.
It's a thing people say.

360
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,140
[Diana] Mm...

361
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,350
Hey, are we gonna get new pages today
or what?

362
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,811
W-w-wait, did you say "Princess Carolyn"?

363
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,772
I'm sorry, "Priscilla Crustacean."

364
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,858
<i>Vamanos,</i> on the pages, okay?

365
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,944
I've been here all day today,
Wednesday, October 24th,

366
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,281
waiting for something to shoot.
<i>Andele, andele, andele!</i>

367
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,076
I think your Priscilla Crustacean
is the same person

368
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,830
as my Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning
in the shape of a woman!

369
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,833
And if she was on set all day
Wednesday, that means--

370
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,210
Bu-- Hold on,
I'm getting to the juicy part.

371
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,130
As soon as I get the thing,
I don't want it anymore.

372
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,383
It feels cheap.
So, no, I wouldn't like a bottle of water.

373
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,135
-[Diana grunts]
-Emotionally naked!

374
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,762
-I knew it!
-Diana! Let me explain.

375
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,139
How long has he been your client?

376
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,098
-Not a client.
-Three--

377
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,225
Days. Friends for three days.

378
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,352
I asked you not to see her.

379
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,397
I asked for one part of my life
that I could have to myself.

380
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,608
News flash, you're not the only one
going through shit.

381
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,109
Maybe if I could talk to you,

382
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,028
I wouldn't need to be looking
for other friends.

383
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,114
Diana, is there anything you'd like
to discuss with BoBo?

384
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,408
We can do it right here.
This is a safe space.

385
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,161
No. This doesn't feel
like a safe space anymore.

386
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,331
I can't keep coming here
if I know you're also seeing him.

387
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,919
Then it sounds like
our time together is done.

388
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:07,836
What?

389
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,630
You're setting a boundary.It is good.

390
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,548
Go forth with the tools I've given you.

391
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,218
Live your life, Diana.
Like a candle in the wind.

392
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,221
-I can't believe this is happening.
-I think BoBo needs me more.

393
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,139
-Would you like validation?
-No.

394
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,601
Your validation is worthless to me now.
You two deserve each other.

395
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,602
[grunts]

396
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,189
Oh, you meant parking validation.
I actually would like that.

397
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,777
Wow, I can't believe you chose BoBo
over your client of seven years.

398
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,694
At a certain point,

399
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,906
I can't hold myself responsible
for other people's dysfunction.

400
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,158
I mean, that is kind of your job.

401
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,869
But at least now you can help
the Angsty Zebra, right?

402
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,079
Well...

403
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,165
-Okay. Now for the real work to begin.
-Real what now?

404
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,501
You did the hard part,
admitting you need help.

405
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,418
Did I admit that?

406
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,171
And now comes the even harder part,
getting the help.

407
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,424
-Let's talk about your mother.
-You know what? This has been great.

408
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,552
I got what I wanted
and I made so much progress!

409
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,137
So, I think I'm done?

410
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,221
-Yes. You did it!
-I--

411
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,307
You changed my stripes!
Dr. Indira, you're great at your job!

412
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,601
-Goodbye forever.
-W-w-w-wait!

413
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,604
I can't believe I lost two clients
in one day.

414
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,189
You're focusing on the negative.

415
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,568
I'm sure you helped them
in ways you'll never know.

416
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,949
This area's all mine.
This is fair game. Ya see the line?

417
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,367
What about popcorn?

418
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,453
Popped is mine. Unpopped is fair game.

419
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,872
-[ringtone playing]
-[phone beeps]

420
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,039
-Hello?
-[Mary-Beth] <i>Todd.</i>

421
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,835
Princess Carolyn was on set all day,
the day of the string cheese theft.

422
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,045
She was not home
when the cheese went missing,

423
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:36,758
rendering any arbitration agreement made
under those conditions null and void.

424
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,011
Whoa! Thanks a lot, Mary-Beth.

425
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,764
Just doing my job, kid.
A doctor heals. A DJ spins.

426
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,560
Bryce Dallas Howard takes the gigs,
Jessica Chastain says no to.

427
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,604
And Mary-Beth mediates.

428
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,024
So, it sounds like
you didn't take my string cheese.

429
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,442
That's what I've been saying!

430
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,778
I don't even know why we had to go through
corporate mediation in the first place!

431
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,489
I guess I just wanted it to be
a workplace dispute,

432
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,284
because I thought if you knew
it was a roommate dispute,

433
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,619
you might kick me out.

434
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,413
I'm not gonna kick you out.
I like having you around.

435
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,706
Oh, really?

436
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,833
Who else would I get to keep my keys cold?

437
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,169
You know, I have this job now.

438
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:17,216
Maybe I could start paying,
I believe it's pronounced "roaunnt?"

439
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,468
Rent? Well. That's a great idea.

440
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,597
But I also need my own space.
Which is why I wanted that office.

441
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,768
Well, then, let's get you that office.
I just need to grab my pen.

442
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,230
-Hey!
-Ugh!

443
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:39,238
Hey. I want to apologize...
for my behavior at Dr. Indira's.

444
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,864
-Don't worry about it.
-She was right.

445
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,534
You need her more than I do.
And I think she can really help you.

446
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,535
Help with what?

447
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,871
I was looking for someone
to hang out with during my lunch.

448
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,998
I didn't want some
psycho-babbling quack job

449
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,125
telling me to get in touch
with my feelings.

450
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,461
-Who needs that?
-I do. I need that.

451
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,297
You don't anymore!
She said it herself, you're fixed!

452
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,799
And then after you left, I was like,

453
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,301
"Hey, if Diane doesn't need this,
I don't need this."

454
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,219
Wait, you quit?

455
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,013
Yeah, I'm not someone therapy works on.
I might be too smart.

456
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,891
Oh, my God. You haven't changed at all.

457
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,060
Whoa, whoa.
Diane, no, no. I'm not the problem here.

458
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,729
None of this would have happened
if I felt like I could talk to you,

459
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,523
my friend, after my mother died.

460
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,025
So, would you like to talk
about your mother?

461
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,986
No, I'm just saying as an example.

462
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,737
Why do you bring things back to my mother?

463
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,447
I can't keep playing this game with you.

464
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,200
You say you wanna get better
and you don't know how.

465
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,162
Well, here's me, your friend,
telling you how: get therapy.

466
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,998
Otherwise, don't waste my time.

467
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,501
Uh, you heard Dr. Indira.
She said we don't need her.

468
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,752
She said I don't need her!

469
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,796
I know, but you're just as screwed up
as I am.

470
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,757
-So, if--
-I am not as screwed up as you are.

471
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,176
Diane, it's me. Come on. We're the same.

472
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,513
[gasps] We are not the same!

473
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,223
-[Diane grunts]
-Whoa.

474
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,058
-[Diane huffs, hums]
-[typing]

475
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,268
Whoa.

476
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:55,689
That's good stuff. We're doing it, Diane.
We're doing it!

477
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,651
I wanna thank everyone
for being so kind this week.

478
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,403
Losing a mother is not easy,

479
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,615
but I am so lucky to have
the support system of my Philbert family.

480
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,784
You know who I really feel bad for
is my dad.

481
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:12,205
He's out on that farm all by himself,
and-- Oh, my God. My dad is dead!

482
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,249
-[all] Aw.
-Cheer up, everyone!

483
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,460
-We got new pages!
-All right!

484
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,379
We're gonna film in the living room
with Philbert and Sassy Malone first.

485
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,465
We're moving into the submarine
for the flashback.

486
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,884
No time to learn lines.
We gotta make up for the lost days,

487
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,386
so we're gonna put the whole thing
on cue cards. Let's go!

488
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,180
{\an8}-All right, everybody stand back.
-[murmus]

489
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,265
[sobbing]

490
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,808
We need lights on the living room!

491
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,435
And action!

492
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,479
Tell me what happened
in the submarine, Philbert.

493
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:39,149
We were doing a routine
submarine sting operation.

494
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,359
Things got outta hand.

495
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:44,654
-Hey. Who do you work for?
-Well, I sure as hell don't work for tips.

496
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,031
-[chuckles]
-[men gasping]

497
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,075
Okay. Hey, Fritz. Be cool. Everybody cool.

498
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:52,162
We are in a pressurized submarine
in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle.

499
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,538
Mm.

500
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,290
Easy... [inhales]

501
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,376
-[all gasping, grunting]
-[gunfire]

502
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,422
-Oh, my God! You killed them all?
-We had to.

503
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,673
These poor guys.

504
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,885
I wonder if they had kids,
families who will never know--

505
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,678
Can you just say the lines, please?

506
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,472
Barf me a river, fartbags.

507
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,265
We gotta make this look like an accident.

508
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,768
You grab the contraband,
I'll set up the explosives. [panting]

509
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,229
[BoJack] <i>I went to the room</i>
<i>where they were keeping the stuff.</i>

510
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,608
<i>-Only there was no stuff.</i>
-Oh, my God!

511
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:25,404
There was a girl there.
She couldn't have been older than 17.

512
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,321
Bring in the girl!

513
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,447
What? What is this?

514
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,616
Keep going! We gotta get this tonight!

515
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:30,992
[Gina] <i>A girl?</i>

516
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,496
[BoJack] <i>They weren't smuggling drugs.</i>
<i>They were smuggling... her.</i>

517
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,290
-Hey. Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. Just do the scene.

518
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,042
[Bojack] <i>I told her</i>
<i>it was going to be okay.</i>

519
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,877
<i>And... she kissed me.</i>

520
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,920
Wha--?

521
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,839
What did you do to her, Philbert?

522
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,590
Nothing. Like I said, she kissed me.

523
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,717
-Kiss her back.
-What?

524
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,511
We need to get you kissing her back.

525
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,846
-What?
-Kiss me, you idiot.

526
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:51,888
Kiss her!

527
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,014
[both moaning]

528
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,518
This whole thing is gonna blow.
We gotta bounce, friendo.

529
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,146
If Fritz hadn't come,
what would you have done with the girl?

530
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,356
{\an8}[Bojack] Part of me is sure
I couldn't go through.

531
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,191
But another part knows that's a lie.

532
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,860
-We can't just leave her.
-[whimpering]

533
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,319
Use your brain, Philbert!

534
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,738
{\an8}Malone, you gotta believe me.
I'm a good guy.

535
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,740
If I'd known she was there,
I never would've--

536
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,534
-Tell me what happened.
-I'll be back.

537
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,703
-You wait right here.
-Come on, loverboy.

538
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,291
You kissed a young girl
and then left her to die.

539
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,960
I'm a good guy.
I didn't know that she was--

540
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,753
You have to understand, I'm a good guy.

541
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,131
-She trusted you.
-How do you make something right

542
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,926
when you've made it so wrong,
you can never go back?

543
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,928
How did you come up with all this?

544
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,223
It's a story I heard once.
I just changed all the names.

545
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,309
I'll never forget that night on The...

546
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,103
U.S.S. New Mexico.

547
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,646
Why are you telling me all this?

548
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,899
It's just good to have someone to talk to.

549
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,442
[Flip] Cut!

550
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,111
-[buzzer blares]
-Amazing! I'm a genius!

551
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,243
[music playing]
