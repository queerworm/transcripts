00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,973
He's not a god.
He's just an old guy who loves pranks.

165
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,725
Sure sounds like God.

166
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,394
-Jurj, hey, man.
-BoJack, right?

167
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,480
Yeah, good to see you.

168
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:47,276
Hey, Jurj, my name's Todd,
and my friend Keith sleeps on your couch.

169
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,820
Oh, you know Keith?
Tell him to clean up his shit.

170
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,656
-[both laughing]
-Oh.

171
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,241
That is so Keith.

172
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,702
Todd, why don't you do the grown-ups
a favor and go find your own shadow?

173
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,121
It was here a second ago.

174
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,333
Jurj, I loved you
in <i>The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.</i>

175
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,794
How do you get in the head
of a war criminal?

176
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,421
You know,
I don't think of him as a war criminal.

177
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,466
I just think of him as a person
who had a funny accent.

178
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,094
Totally. I think I'm getting
the hang of all this now.

179
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:17,723
You won last night, the other guy
won tonight, maybe I'll win next time.

180
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,269
Yikes.
Look, man, you're not gonna be next.

181
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,021
This will sound dumb
coming out of my mouth, but it's true.

182
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:29,026
So Jurj, Bread, Mitt, those are names.
Like real names.

183
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,654
Lernernerner DiCarpricorn, that's a name.

184
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,698
-BoJack, not a name.
-Huh.

185
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,075
I figured they would, like,
tell you this stuff.

186
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,494
You're the Fifth Man. You get it, right?

187
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,788
-Well--
-Yeah, you get it. Put her there.

188
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,872
-[zapping]
-Oh!

189
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,084
-Joy buzzer. You just got Jurjed!
-[groaning]

190
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,961
All right, I'll see you later.

191
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:51,841
Vivica.
Now I know why they call you A. Fox.

192
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,552
Excuse me, you gonna stay here long?

193
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,138
We got the OCD Image Awards tomorrow,

194
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:00,433
and those guys really like
a clean afterparty.

195
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,059
[groaning]

196
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,606
{\an8}So, let me get this straight, Sextina.

197
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,066
{\an8}Someone put a baby in your belly
and now you're like,

198
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,527
"Awooga!
Is there an undo button around here?

199
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,070
Leggo my preggo."

200
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,115
-Is that right?
-That is exactly correct, A Ryan,

201
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:20,578
but I am very excited for this opportunity
to put a face on this important issue.

202
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,789
One out of three women
will have an abortion in her life.

203
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,500
That sounds crazy high to me,
I don't buy it.

204
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,920
I wanted to destigmatize the experience
for all women out there,

205
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,173
so I'm dropping a new single.

206
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,716
-What?
- <i>♪ Surprise! ♪</i>

207
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,801
-New single?
-Just relax.

208
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,096
Crack an egg on your head,
feel the yolk drip down.

209
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,474
America, get your uteruses turnt,

210
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,602
'cause this song is called
"Get Dat Fetus Kill Dat Fetus."

211
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,728
Oh, dear.

212
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,231
{\an8}♪ <i>I'm a baby killer</i>
<i>Baby killing makes me horny ♪</i>

213
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,318
♪ <i>Alien's inside me</i>
<i>I'm gonna squash it like Sigourney ♪</i>

214
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,153
No, stop.

215
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,155
♪ <i>Get that fetus, kill that fetus ♪</i>

216
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,074
♪ <i>Brrap brrap pew pew... ♪</i>

217
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,326
Christ, stop the tape.

218
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:04,330
Glasses, you did this.
You empowered me to tell my story.

219
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,959
I think the tone might be a little severe?

220
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,880
Look, when you get an abortion,
you can express yourself however you want,

221
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,508
but this is about my body and my choices,

222
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,595
and my choice
is to be a totally insane badass.

223
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,598
Ugh! I <i>am </i>getting an abortion.
You're not even really pregnant.

224
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,477
So? This is show business.
"Brrap brrap. Pew pew."

225
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,689
{\an8}"Brrap brrap. Pew pew."

226
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,318
{\an8}A daring battle cry from
the self-appointed New Voice of Choice.

227
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,905
{\an8}But has the concept of women
having choices gone too far?

228
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,783
{\an8}We've assembled this diverse panel
of white men in bow ties

229
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,660
{\an8}to talk about abortion. Gentlemen?

230
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,246
{\an8}Tom, this is not just a woman's issue.

231
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,415
{\an8}I'm a man, but if I got pregnant,

232
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,460
{\an8}would I put my life on hold
for a child I didn't want? Yes, I would.

233
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,837
{\an8}I can say that with confidence,

234
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,006
{\an8}because I will never have to make
that decision, so I'm unbiased.

235
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,677
{\an8}-Does this video glamorize abortion?
-Very possibly, Tom.

236
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,972
{\an8}Millennials today think everything is NBD.

237
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,101
{\an8}NBD of course stands for No BD,
referring to B.D. Wong,

238
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,437
{\an8}who teens think is a very big deal.

239
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,233
{\an8}So if something's not BD,
it means it's not a big deal.

240
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:19,447
{\an8}-These days, abortions are not BD.
-Are abortions even necessary?

241
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,033
{\an8}I heard a theory that if a woman
really has an unwanted pregnancy,

242
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,120
{\an8}the body has a way to break the fetus down
into gas particles

243
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,122
{\an8}and then she can just fart it out.

244
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,459
{\an8}Where did you hear this intriguing
"fart it out" theory?

245
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,296
{\an8}-I don't remember. Maybe the Bible?
-Thank you for clarifying.

246
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,549
{\an8}Next up, Jurj Clooners
is making audiences cry

247
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,511
{\an8}in his new film, but his latest prank
might make you... think?

248
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,264
[groaning]
Jurj. He likes pranks, huh?

249
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,933
I'll prank him. I'll prank him real good.

250
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,436
We'll need to draw him out.
What do A-list actors like?

251
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,563
Stretch limos? Nannies?

252
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:56,859
Flying their private jets
to disaster areas so they can "help out"?

253
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,402
Yeah, limos. We'll get a limo.

254
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,654
I'll need one of those caps,
I'll be the driver.

255
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,282
I'll pick him up,
and he'll be all like, "I'm Jurj, I suck,"

256
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,160
and then I'll be all, "Surprise,"
and hit him with a bat.

257
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,328
Pranked!

258
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:11,624
It really doesn't seem like a prank
as much as you hitting him with a bat.

259
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:15,336
Yeah, it's a bad prank on purpose
to show how stupid pranks are.

260
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,671
-That's the point.
-Is that the point?

261
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,508
I'm working on levels here, man.
To the limousine repository.

262
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,344
[paparazzi yelling]

263
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,930
[with accent]
Good afternoon, Mr. Clooners.

264
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,807
Hey, man, just one sec,
my publicist is right behind me.

265
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,477
Of course. Bring the publicist.

266
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,855
-Oh, shit.
-What's that, driver?

267
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:39,068
I said, "Auschwitz."
You're the Nazi who played Yahtzee.

268
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,030
Right, well, anyway, we're going
to the AOL-Time-Warner-PepsiCo-Viacom

269
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,075
Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota-Trader Joe's
Auditorium

270
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,910
for the Image Choice Spirit Awards.

271
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:52,790
Uh... okay, yes, ma'am.
Here I go. Driving, driving.

272
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,292
You don't need to talk,
you can just drive.

273
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,169
Actually, can we make a couple stops?

274
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,839
I am totally out of toilet paper,
so if you could find a Rite Aid.

275
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:05,928
You have to go in and buy the TP for me.
I'll get mobbed by fans if I go in.

276
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,264
Just pick out something
extra soft for my tushy.

277
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,891
-I don't know
-Do as he says, driver.

278
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,644
-Chop chop.
-Okay.

279
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,441
My concern is that you're
actually giving the pro-life movement

280
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,485
something to latch onto
as an example of--

281
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,904
Oh, my God, you are so boring.

282
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,490
Can I abort talking to you right now?
Abort.

283
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,827
-You need to stop and think--
-Or what? You gonna sic Fido on me?

284
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,496
I am just here for emotional support.

285
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,416
Can you let it go?
I don't want to have to ask you again.

286
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,835
I really think we have the chance
to say something here,

287
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,338
and all we're saying
is "Pshew pshew pow."

288
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,840
-What is that?
-What are you doing?

289
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,508
That's the gun sounds, from the song.

290
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,094
Uh. Do you mean, "Brrap brrap pew pew"?

291
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,638
Yeah, that's what I did. "Pshow, kapow."

292
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,682
-That's not what a gun sounds like.
-Prrow!

293
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,434
-Pshow, kapow!
-Bop!

294
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,227
-Brrap brrap pew pew!
-Ppew, ping!

295
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,563
Can everyone please
stop making gun sounds?

296
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,231
It is really freaking me out.

297
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,734
My point is,
everyone's listening to you now.

298
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,570
Soon people are gonna get bored
and move onto the next thing

299
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,114
and you'll hate yourself
that you weren't able to make a difference

300
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,407
when you had the chance.

301
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,868
Believe me,
it happens sooner than you think.

302
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,411
Oh...

303
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,164
Hi. I'm A Ryan Sea--
[screaming]

304
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,460
Okay, we're here, finally. Get out.

305
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,420
Ooh, can we make one more stop?

306
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,089
I just remembered
we left my wife back at the house.

307
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,050
Can we go back? Pwease?

308
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,302
Driver? The man said, "Pwease."

309
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:32,806
That's it. Enough.
I am not your driver. It is I, BoJack.

310
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,601
[gasping]
BoJack? What are you doing?

311
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,395
I was gonna prank Jurj
by hitting him with this bat,

312
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:42,024
but you got into the car because,
apparently, you are a two-timing liar.

313
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,734
What's the thing with the bat?

314
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,028
BoJack, this is not a good look on you.

315
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,030
All this time,
I thought you believed in me.

316
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,741
This is why your clients win every year.
You represent everyone.

317
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,369
It has nothing to do with whether
you're a good publicist or not.

318
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,371
I am a marvelous publicist.

319
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,540
Not to me. You're doing great work
for this asshole who loves pranks.

320
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,875
You're pranking him right now.

321
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,045
Yeah, with a bad prank
to show how stupid pranks are.

322
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,005
Seems a little convoluted,

323
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,633
which is actually a trademark
of a great prank.

324
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,051
Well played, sir.

325
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,012
No, it's a bad prank.
That's my point. Pranks are dumb.

326
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,391
We're late, and I won't keep going
round and round with you on this.

327
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,184
Publicists have many clients.

328
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,978
Not my publicist. You're fired.

329
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,522
Are you kidding?
Who fires Ana Spanakopita?

330
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,690
I do. I just did.

331
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,651
[scoffing] Who's gonna set up
your press appearances?

332
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,028
Your hopeless agent? Your idiot sidekick?

333
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,322
Not your problem.
Get the hell out of my limo.

334
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,492
'Cause I gotta pick up
a bachelorette party in 30 minutes.

335
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,747
{\an8}Sextina, welcome to the program.
Can I get a "pew pew" for the fans?

336
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:43,168
{\an8}-Tom, abortion is a very serious subject.
-Yes, very serious, I agree.

337
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,462
{\an8}I want to tell the real story
about abortion,

338
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,297
{\an8}show America what it's really about,

339
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,342
{\an8}which is why your girl Sextina Aquafina

340
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,971
{\an8}is gonna have her abortion
live on television.

341
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,097
{\an8}What what?

342
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,683
{\an8}Pay-per-view, chitches.

343
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,892
-What?
-What?

344
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,479
"Pay-per-view, chitches."
Brrap brrap, pew pew, ka-ching ka-ching.

345
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,232
How are you going to have
an abortion on live TV

346
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,942
when you're not even
really having an abortion?

347
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,737
-Duh, we'll just <i>Argo </i>that shit.
-What does that mean?

348
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,532
Yeah, yeah. Fake abortion.
Movie magic, like in <i>Argo.</i>

349
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,409
That is not what happened in <i>Argo.</i>

350
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,078
If we're gonna do this,
we got to be real tasteful.

351
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,790
Yeah, only the best for my abortion.
All class.

352
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,709
John Carpenter
can do the practical effects.

353
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,419
-He owes me a favor.
-What?

354
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,796
We'll book Eddie Redmayne as the fetus.

355
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,173
Are you hearing yourselves?

356
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,634
We're not going to fake an abortion
on live TV.

357
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,219
Obviously, we'll pre-tape it.

358
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,306
Then put a little box in the corner
of the screen that says "Live."

359
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,975
You don't think
this is incredibly disrespectful

360
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,144
to the women who actually get abortions?

361
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,729
Not if we do it tasteful.

362
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,066
Diane, this is what the client wants.
Stop making it about you.

363
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,692
I'm not making it about me.

364
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,904
-I am so tired of you creating problems.
-I'm not--

365
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,739
I'm sorry you're so fertile

366
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,408
and in a sexually active,
loving relationship

367
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,118
and now you don't want a family.

368
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,954
-I'm sure that's really hard for you.
-What?

369
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,917
Uh... if this is not about me anymore,
then I'mma go.

370
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,377
Y'all figure your shit out
and get back at me.

371
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,379
Where's that ZZ Top mofo at?

372
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,466
Can a chitch
get a parking validation or what?

373
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,676
Is there something you want to say to me?

374
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,761
[sighs]

375
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:21,391
I have given everything to get where I am,
and I am not about to throw all that away.

376
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,019
She wants an abortion?
I'm getting her an abortion.

377
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,064
-You know this is bullshit.
-It's all bullshit, Diane.

378
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,860
That's the gig. And you're not good enough
at this job to be too good for this job.

379
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,612
I won't be a part of this.

380
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,073
[groaning]

381
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,075
Yo, Beardo, where did you go?

382
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,120
I need to get my parking validation did,
or I cannot leave.

383
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,539
Y'all's trippin' if you think
Sextina Aquafina

384
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,041
is paying $15 for parking.

385
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,505
All right, new publicist.
What do you got for me?

386
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:56,218
Secretariat was an athlete, right?
And you used to be an athlete.

387
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,427
What? No, I didn't.

388
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,223
You didn't play baseball and football?
Oh, um...

389
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,433
You know, I think I Googled the wrong guy.

390
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,771
-Did you think I was Bo Jackson?
-This idea I know you're going to like.

391
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,731
You know that car wash on Alvarado?

392
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:15,070
They need someone to dress up
like a gorilla and spin a sign.

393
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,363
Why would I do that?

394
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,740
Anything that gets your face
out there, right?

395
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,535
How does it get my face out there
dressed like a gorilla?

396
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,995
Maybe that one's a dud,

397
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,831
but hey, you think Lou Bega
knocked it out of the park

398
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,583
with "Mambo Number One"?

399
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,336
-No, but he kept at it.
-[groaning]

400
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,047
-[crowd chattering]
-[babies crying]

401
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:38,719
I'm making things all about me?
I'm the one who's having an abortion.

402
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,139
-It's ridiculous.
-They're completely morally bankrupt.

403
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,600
I agree with you, 247 percent.

404
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,935
I just wrote "morally bankrupt"
on this form.

405
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,564
You were right to do that.
This form is being very nosy right now.

406
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,107
Why did I even take that job?

407
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,569
You were going through a rough time,
Princess Carolyn wanted to help you

408
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,362
and she offered you the job.

409
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:01,200
Which she should not have done.
So morally bankrupt.

410
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,243
Okay, yeah, that was nice.

411
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,787
But still,
she is putting her company's bottom line

412
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,957
before the very real damage
that bottle-nosed maniac

413
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,126
is doing every time
she gets on the news and--

414
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,295
[gasping]
That's it, the news.

415
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,673
I gotta take the high road,
go on the news and rat those suckers out.

416
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,884
Is that really a good idea?

417
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,427
It is if you think it is,

418
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,804
because I am here to support you
no matter what,

419
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,807
but maybe it isn't the best idea?

420
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:30,395
Like, if that idea were a Dillon brother
maybe it's a Kevin, not a Matt?

421
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:34,066
Someone has to tell the world
that Sextina is a total fraud.

422
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,984
[girl] You know Sextina Aquafina?

423
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:40,989
-Oh. Yeah, I mean, I work with her.
-Oh. She is so cool.

424
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:45,702
Sextina's music makes me feel strong,
like I can do anything.

425
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,995
It doesn't offend you?

426
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,622
What about the part where she says,

427
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,416
"I hope and pray to God
my little fetus has a soul

428
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,045
'cause I want it to feel pain
when I eject it from my hole"?

429
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,006
It's a joke.
You get that it's a joke, right?

430
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,050
Well, obviously.

431
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,220
Do you think she actually wants
to shoot her fetus with a gun?

432
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,640
-No, I get it.
-Getting an abortion is scary.

433
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,350
With all the protesters out front,

434
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,644
how you have to listen
to the heartbeat and all that.

435
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,314
When you can joke about it,
it makes it less scary, you know?

436
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,650
[sighing]
Yeah.

437
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,026
[nurse]
Diane?

438
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,995
Ana?

439
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,039
I won't be working with Jurj anymore.

440
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,209
I let him know this morning.

441
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,586
First he thought I was doing
a really good prank,

442
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,547
but eventually I think he understood.

443
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,048
You dropped Jurj?

444
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,927
Jurj Clooners?
Sexiest Man in America Jurj Clooners?

445
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,222
Jurj is easy. Everyone loves him.

446
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,684
I've got a master's degree in Publicist,
it's time to put that to use.

447
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,770
I dropped all my other clients.
You're the underdog.

448
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:58,066
I want to put all my attention on you
and get you that Oscar.

449
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,068
So nobody else, huh? Good.

450
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,946
Just all your hopes and dreams
pinned on me.

451
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,489
Somehow beating the odds

452
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,993
and winning the highest possible accolade
in an actor's career.

453
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,370
-I know we can do it.
-Just me, huh?

454
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,789
Wow, that's actually. That--

455
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,833
Is someone standing on my windpipe?

456
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,002
Let's just get Jurj on the phone so we--

457
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,379
No, BoJack. I believe in you, okay?

458
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,048
Okay.

459
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,257
Whoa, Ana, what are you--?

460
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,093
-Oh, boy.
-Shh... It's okay.

461
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,264
-When you fired me, it was thrilling.
-Oh. Ana...

462
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,183
Nobody talks to me like that.

463
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:35,854
It reminded me that I work for you,
and I liked that.

464
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,980
Okay, but--

465
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:41,943
Do you like that?
Being in control? Being the star?

466
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,028
Yes.

467
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,239
You're my star, BoJack. My shining star.

468
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,366
-But don't you ever...
-Ow, too tight.

469
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,744
-...try to screw me again.
-Ouch! Oh, please.

470
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,080
-Do you understand?
-Yes. God, yes.

471
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,456
Good.

472
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,419
I'll see you tomorrow bright and early.
You have my undivided attention now.

473
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,756
-Uh...
-[door opens, closes]

474
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,051
[doctor]
<i>How are you feeling, Sextina?</i>

475
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,096
[Sextina] <i>A little queasy</i>
<i>but on the whole, wonderful.</i>

476
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,556
[doctor] <i>Good. Now, I do accept tips.</i>

477
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,685
-That was surprisingly tasteful.
-And educational, right?

478
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,604
Yeah. Weirdly educational.

479
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:22,859
I actually learned a lot about abortion,
and I just had an abortion.

480
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,070
-How are you feeling?
-I feel shitty.

481
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,613
I mean, physically.

482
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:30,450
I'm glad I did it,
but mostly I just felt old.

483
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,662
There were all these teenagers there.
Twenty-somethings.

484
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,541
I know from the outside, it might seem
like I should be ready for kids,

485
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,708
but I can't--

486
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,963
Diane, you don't need
to explain anything to anyone.

487
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,382
[phone buzzing]

488
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:50,679
-Sextina. Great job, we did it.
<i>-Yeah, so, little wrinkle.</i>

489
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,181
I've been having a lot of sex, you know,

490
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,977
'cause I'm a sexual creature
and dolphins do have sex for pleasure.

491
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,479
I just found out
I got knocked up for real.

492
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,482
-What?
-And I think I want to keep it.

493
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,569
But that might be a little confusing
to my fans,

494
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,030
since they just saw me
get the old scoopity doopity?

495
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,868
Okay, we're gonna handle this.
Meet us at the office in 20 minutes.

496
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,955
First thing is we gotta get her
out of town before she starts to show.

497
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,584
Yeah, we'll send her to that farm
where celebrities go to disappear,

498
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,878
where Chad Michael Murray
and Thora Birch went.

499
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,380
Film a bunch of music videos now,
and then--

500
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,925
Release them over the next year
so it seems like she's still around.

501
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,262
Then when she comes back,
we'll say she adopted a baby.

502
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:37,017
[Carolyn] People are going to love that.
[Diane] Yeah. Everyone loves a baby.
