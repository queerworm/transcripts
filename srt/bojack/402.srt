-Are you all right?
-It's okay. I'm okay.

330
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,877
My hands are doing the wiggly doozle
in three-four time, but--

331
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,963
Say, I got a swell idea.
Why don't you drive?

332
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,297
But I don't know how.

333
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,217
Why, it's only as easy
as finding a hobo in a barrel of beans.

334
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,970
It'll be grand.
Everything will be just grand.

335
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,180
-[BoJack laughing]
-[Eddie] Whoo!

336
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,057
-[shouting]
-Get back here!

337
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,103
Aaah! [gasps]

338
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,147
-Jeepers!
-[sobbing]

339
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,524
Yeah! We're hooligans!

340
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,193
Faster. I want to feel alive again.

341
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,529
I'd do anything to feel alive.

342
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,575
-[screaming]
-[metal crunching]

343
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,662
[Eddie laughing]

344
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:30,127
I gotta say, you really knew
how to handle those salad tongs

345
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,754
for someone who appears
to have never eaten a salad.

346
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,007
Yeah? Well, you got a nice set of pipes.

347
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,509
You're like a Josh Groban
who doesn't also think he's funny.

348
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,719
[grunts]

349
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:44,600
Okay, now, the house
is absolutely, totally finished.

350
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,102
Wow.

351
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,606
I wish I could somehow
pay you back for all your help.

352
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,316
Don't sweat it.

353
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,028
Hey, Eddie.

354
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,654
-Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa!
-[crashing]

355
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,573
-Ow! [groans]
-What are you doing?

356
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,949
What the hell'd you do that for?

357
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,243
I don't know, I thought
you would fly to save me

358
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,830
and by making you fly I would,
in a sense, be saving you!

359
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,959
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't fly!

360
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,794
You're flying right now, asshole!

361
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,213
[gasps, groans]

362
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,508
-Why'd you make me do that?
-[groans] You're welcome.

363
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,636
I haven't flown since Lorraine died,

364
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,512
and now you ruined it.

365
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:26,058
Okay. Obviously, this was not
the preferred outcome for either of us.

366
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,727
You want to fly?
All right, let's fly. [grunts]

367
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,313
-Oh, shit. No, I'm fine, actually.
-You want to go higher?

368
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,856
You want to see how high we can go?

369
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,485
Clearly, this is a sore subject. I was
wrong to bring it up. Let's go back down.

370
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,488
The night Lorraine died
she wanted to go back,

371
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,574
but I wanted to see
how high we could go.

372
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,742
Whoa! Plane! Look out!

373
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,079
You want to know how Lorraine felt
when she got sucked into that engine?

374
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,623
-We're all just tiny bugs, right?
-[groaning]

375
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,585
Aaaah!

376
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,101
[panting]

377
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,229
Oh, God. No, no, come on.

378
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,106
-Come on.
-[coughing]

379
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,066
Are you insane?!

380
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,693
I don't want to live!

381
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,280
Why did you save me?
[sobbing]

382
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,783
I don't want to live!

383
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,703
[crying]

384
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,083
What were you thinking,
hoofing around the dance floor

385
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,584
like a motorized freckle?

386
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,587
-Did you snap your cap?
-You mustn't despise me, darling.

387
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,549
-Please.
-That's before mentioning poor Beatrice.

388
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,885
You aiming to get her killed as well?
She's all we got.

389
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,637
Oh, don't be cross with Mother!

390
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,097
I don't know what's wrong with me.

391
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,727
How am I supposed to sell sugar <i>and</i>
keep my secretary's self-esteem afloat

392
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,521
when you're having
honest-to-goodness fits of hysteria?

393
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,940
-Don't yell, Father.
-I just can't anymore.

394
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,900
I can't stop thinking about him.

395
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,945
I can't be with people
and I can't be alone.

396
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,947
I don't know how to be better, Joseph.

397
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,283
-Please fix me. I want to be better.
-[door opens]

398
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,828
[panting]

399
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,455
-[phone beeps]
-[line ringing]

400
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,790
[muffled gasp]

401
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,084
BoJack? Where are you?
Are you okay?

402
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,503
[panting] I don't know. I'm so sorry.

403
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,881
It's okay. Talk to me.
What's going on?

404
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,300
[BoJack] <i>It's Michigan,</i>
<i>and it's beautiful here,</i>

405
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,427
-and everything sucks.
<i>-Michigan?</i>

406
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,721
-BoJack, come home.
<i>-I can't.</i>

407
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,890
I don't belong there,
I don't belong anywhere.

408
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:33,143
But that's the thing,
everybody belongs in Los Angeles.

409
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,980
<i>-There's, like, no barrier for entry.</i>
-Oh, God, that's true. [sighs]

410
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,732
They do let in just anybody.

411
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,943
I was at a coffee shop yesterday,
I heard a guy trying to impress someone

412
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,404
by soft-pitching a web series
he crowdfunded.

413
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,366
Let me guess: the web series is about
how funny he and his friends are,

414
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,620
-just, like, hanging out.
-He described it as HBO's <i>Girls</i>

415
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,039
-but, like, from a guy's perspective.
<i>-What?!</i>

416
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,625
And he's just giving this away for free
in a coffee shop?

417
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,085
Somebody get this guy an overall!

418
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,087
Well, the important thing
is that barista's

419
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,380
definitely going to have sex
with him later.

420
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,757
[chuckling]

421
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,301
I've missed you, Diane.

422
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,053
I've missed you, too.

423
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,599
Mmm. [slurping]

424
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,603
-Is Mother okay?
-She is now.

425
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,981
She just let her womanly emotions
get the better of her, that's all.

426
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,484
Nothing a little operation couldn't fix.

427
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,693
Operation?

428
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,279
What's broken in the heart
can never be repaired,

429
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:30,075
but the brain, well, we have
all sorts of science for the brain.

430
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:34,996
She's a brand new woman now,
and she'd like to meet you very much.

431
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,415
[note plays]

432
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,838
-Mother?
-Oh, hello.

433
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,339
It's Beatrice.

434
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:47,425
Yes, that's right.
What a pretty girl.

435
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,554
-What did they do to you? [sobs]
-Oh, hush.

436
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,390
It's okay. I'm better now.

437
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,058
I don't understand.

438
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,812
Love does things to a person,
terrible things.

439
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,063
[sniffles, sighs]

440
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:03,150
Beatrice, promise me
you'll never love anyone

441
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:07,237
-as much as I loved Crackerjack.
-I promise. I won't.

442
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,239
Why, I have half a mind...

443
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,867
[truck advancing, beeping]

444
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,416
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
There we go, big boy.

445
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,126
Hey, what's going on out here?

446
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,461
Probably should have warned you,

447
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,005
when these guys tear the house down
it might make some noise.

448
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,173
Tear the <i>house </i>down?!

449
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,634
Uh, yeah. You think I just want
to mope around in a shrine to the past,

450
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,721
getting off on my own guilt
while the rest of my life passes me by?

451
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,763
Pathetic, much?

452
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,641
But we spent the last eight months
restoring this place.

453
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,310
Yeah, and then you tried to kill me.

454
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,312
That's usually a series wrap
on a friendship.

455
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,814
-What is a series wrap?
-Are you serious?

456
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,525
Oh, my God, what am I doing
in this backwash of a town?

457
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,235
Do you even get Showtime here?

458
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,404
-So what was all this for?
-I don't know.

459
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,156
Guess it was just a big waste of time.

460
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,117
But you can't change the past.
Time's arrow marches on, right?

461
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,327
I don't believe this.

462
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,873
Well, as a great woman once said,
suck a dick, dumbshit. [grunts]

463
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,751
