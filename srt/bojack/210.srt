00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,434
Aw, she looks so peaceful.

3
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,228
Think she's dreaming that
she's not overstaying her welcome?

4
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,481
When she got that wine delivered
to the house,

5
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,442
I thought that was her thank-you present,
that she was leaving,

6
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,195
-but then she just drank the wine.
-Five days ago.

7
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,905
-Morning, everybody.
-Aah! Kinko!

8
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:33,158
Another beautiful day
in the city of Brotherly Angels.

9
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,829
Todd, I don't recall
accidentally ingesting poison,

10
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,998
and yet here you are
trying to make me vomit.

11
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,709
You wanna go buy me a kite
and then fly a kite?

12
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,585
No. Kites are sky trash.

13
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:48,340
[groans]
Why is it so daytime right now?

14
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,341
Wanda?

15
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,592
[groaning]

16
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,804
Wanna go surf some cloud waves?
That's what I call wind.

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,848
Sorry. Some of us have jobs.

18
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,058
Not all of us. Just some of us.

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,227
Oh, yeah, my job.

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,397
-Morning.
-[J.D.] What?

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,067
I'm done with my sabbatical
and I'm ready to get back to work.

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,819
What sabbatical? I fired you.

23
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,238
Oh, I thought
when you said, "You're fired,"

24
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,074
that was just you
"giving me the business."

25
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,493
No, I was taking the "business"
away from you.

26
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,078
Oh.

27
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,998
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
You wanna go fly a kite?

28
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,291
Put me down
for a supersized "sounds great."

29
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,587
But with an even larger main course
of "sadly, I cannot."

30
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:30,465
I am swamped here at work.
First, I gotta put my suit on.

31
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,175
Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.

32
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,844
Then we record the show.

33
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,137
And then I gotta take my suit off.

34
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,224
So, that's, like, the whole day. Sorry.

35
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,018
[groans]

36
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:42,978
[groans]

37
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:44,813
Ah.

38
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,105
"Looking for a friend?"

39
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,399
Yes.

40
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,817
"Need direction?"

41
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,235
I'm listening.

42
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,613
{\an8}"Try Scientology"?

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,698
-Huh.
-Excuse me? Sir?

44
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,033
-Huh?
-Have you ever thought

45
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,452
about trying improv comedy?

46
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,205
Improv comedy? I don't know...

47
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,708
Why not?
It's not like there's anything else to do.

48
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,209
Here on Mars.

49
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,628
We're on Mars?

50
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:12,424
Yes. And in a Martian ice cream shop.
Care for a butterscotch swirl?

51
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,508
Whoa!

52
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,136
The only limit is my imagination.

53
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,014
Why not come by our theater
and try a free class?

54
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:23,102
Okay!
Can I bring this food inside the theater?

55
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,853
Ha, good one.

56
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,188
-But no.
-Oh.

00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,901

-Of course. You were phenomenal.

00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,306
Really? Because that kid sneezed
in the middle of my monologue.

66
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,101
{\an8}-We can fix that in post.
-Abe, I'm supposed to tell you

67
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,936
{\an8}the boom mike fell into the last shot.

68
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,731
You sure you don't wanna get another take?
Just for safety?

69
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,692
{\an8}What am I, Kubrick?
We can fix all this stuff in post.

70
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,736
{\an8}It's an easy scene.

71
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:00,074
{\an8}Secretariat's a nice guy,
the Spanish kids learn a lesson.

72
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,575
{\an8}Boom. Bam! Done!

73
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,786
{\an8}But Secretariat never actually taught math
in South Central.

74
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,749
{\an8}I don't know what Secretariat did
or didn't do. I wasn't there.

75
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,710
{\an8}-Yeah, but--
-Okay, so the studio wants gangbangers,

76
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,128
{\an8}we'll give them gangbangers.

77
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,505
{\an8}-We get paid either way, right?
-I guess.

78
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,759
{\an8}I can't wait to get home.
I got a coq au vin in the slow cooker.

79
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,052
{\an8}You like coq au vin?

80
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:23,180
{\an8}I think so. Is that the move
where a French girl pours soup in--

81
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,723
{\an8}Come over for dinner, okay?

82
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,100
{\an8}-You'll love it.
-Okay.

83
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,603
{\an8}Chin up, big guy.
So, we ain't making <i>Casablanca.</i>

00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,362
{\an8}-What?
-Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.

00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,449
{\an8}As you know, you're my favorite client.

89
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,244
{\an8}If I left Vigor,
would you follow me to a new agency?

90
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,205
{\an8}Sure, but no one's gonna hire me
after this movie comes out.

91
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,833
{\an8}The script turned into a piece of shit,
and the director is a total hack.

92
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,127
{\an8}Good guy, total hack.

93
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,629
{\an8}Let's get you something
before the movie comes out.

94
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,632
{\an8}We got an offer in for this new play
off-Broadway.

95
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,467
Theater? That's what real actors do.

96
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,095
Yeah, I told them that,
but they said she wanted you.

97
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,680
-She?
-Yeah, this hot new playwright Jill Pill.

98
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,557
-She came out of nowhere.
-Jill Pill?

99
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,060
<i>New York Magazine </i>called her
the <i>enfant terrible</i>

100
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,561
of the immersive theater world,

101
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,981
and then later clarified
that that's a compliment.

102
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,650
It sounds like the kind of thing
I should be doing now.

103
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,028
-Something artistic and bold.
-Rehearsals start in two weeks.

104
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,281
Are you ready to go to New York
for six months?

105
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,033
New York's a great city to live in
for six months

106
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:28,536
and not a second longer and only
if you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!

107
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,792
Now, that's a lot of apple sauce.

108
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,794
[all] Apple sauce!

109
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,920
Oh-ho!

110
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,255
That was so funny.

111
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,757
Which one of you guys
wrote all those funny jokes?

112
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,262
No, Todd, here at Shenanigags,
we make things up on the spot.

113
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,473
-Let's try it. Give me a suggestion.
-Uh... I don't know.

114
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,683
Suggestions?

115
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,684
[all laughing]

116
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,811
Your suggestion was "suggestions."

117
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,563
-Way to break the fourth wall.
-That wasn't that funny.

118
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,608
My name's Bryan
and you haven't won me over yet.

119
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,401
-Oh, Bryan.
-Todd, in improv,

120
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,697
we get suggestions from an audience
then make up scenes based on them.

121
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,326
There are just a few simple rules.
You don't ask questions. You don't say no.

122
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:11,412
No matter what. When someone makes a
suggestion, you always try to build on it.

123
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,414
We call that "yes, and..."

124
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,919
Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.
It's all part of the fun.

125
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,462
Is it really that simple?

126
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,133
Ugh! It's incredibly complicated
and requires years of training.

127
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,134
Oh, Bryan.

128
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,136
[all laughing]

129
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,265
But improv isn't just about a constant
clamoring for attention and validation.

130
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,350
It's about community.

131
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,894
I've always wanted to be part
of a community.

132
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,395
Well, you are now.
Your first class is $200.

133
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,357
I thought you said it was free.

134
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,068
Oh, that was just me doing an improv.

135
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,365
I am so proud of you.

136
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,868
Every day I'm telling people all about
the great stuff you're doing there.

137
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,038
-Yeah, I don't know--
-<i>And they say, "Wow, she sounds amazing."</i>

138
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,957
And I say, "I'm here to confirm
she is an incredible woman."

139
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,834
-<i>Well--</i>
-You know, the sound guy's wife

140
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,294
works with at-risk teens.

141
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:03,298
And I was like, "Yeah, that's okay,
but compared to what my wife is doing,

142
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,050
-your wife is bullshit!"
-<i>Oh.</i>

143
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,551
And he had to agree with me.

144
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,469
-Um--
-Because I am his boss.

145
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,931
-Listen--
-<i>Let me talk to one of the locals.</i>

146
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,726
I wanna hear someone else talk
about how what a selfless hero my wife is.

147
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,603
-Oh, uh...
-Ah, now come on.

148
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,814
-Most refugees got their tongues cut out.
-Find one with a tongue.

149
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,441
-<i>I don't think--</i>
-Indulge me.

150
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,442
Okay.

151
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,904
[in softer voice]
Hello. I am refugee from village.

00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,032
Hey, what's your name, Superstar?

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,119
Uh, my name is...

Ah. Kofi Makir.
Am I pronouncing that right?

156
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,592
Hey, Todd, you had some killer provs
in class today.

157
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,845
Yes, and that zombie dentist scene
was so innovative.

158
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:51,846
Eh...

159
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,848
-Oh, Bryan.
-Guys, look.

162
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,103
-Who's that?
-What are you, new?

163
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,604
Yes, I am new.

164
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,107
Copernicus is the founder of Shenanigags.

165
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,567
That guy is the Jan-Ove Waldner
of modern improv.

166
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,654
-Who is Jan-Ove Waldner?
-The Michael Jordan of table tennis.

167
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,822
Oh.

00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,949
-Let's go talk to him.
-Are you kidding?

169
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,118
You can't just go up and talk
to Copernicus.

170
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,121
Man, Todd, you don't know shit.
You're just a tourist.

171
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,247
No, I'm not.

172
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,334
If you're one of us, prove it.
Go improv that lady over there.

173
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,709
Freestyle.

174
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,878
No audience, no net.

175
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,547
-I don't know...
-Hey, if you're down with the prov,

176
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,841
you gotta prove that prov.

177
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,260
All right. I'll do it.

178
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,764
-Hello, old ma'am.
-Oh, hello.

179
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,601
I'm just waiting for my friend Doris.
Have you seen her?

180
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,560
Yes,

181
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,605
and she exploded?

182
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,524
Doris exploded?

183
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,027
-You just got prov'd!
-In your face, lady!

184
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,278
The streets are ours!

185
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,531
-Hurray, improv! I did it!
-You have briefly won me over.

186
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,370
Poor Doris...

187
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,666
That is not what I thought coq au vin was.
But it's great.

188
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,836
Well, I'm no Emeril Lagasse,
but we do get by.

189
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,339
-Oh, stop. [laughs]
-Bam!

190
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,383
Like Emeril? Ha, remember that?

191
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,300
He said "bam."

192
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,011
I don't know who Emeril is,
but he sounds delightful.

193
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,679
Hey, should I give him a sitcom?

194
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,932
BoJack, Abe tells me
you guys are almost done with the movie.

195
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,934
One week left!

196
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,812
You two lovebirds gonna do
any traveling or anything?

197
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,149
I'll be traveling back and forth
to New York for the next few months

198
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,860
because BoJack's doing a play there
after you finish.

199
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,237
-Oh, I love plays.
-A play.

200
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,864
That's my favorite place
to eat crinkly candies.

201
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,825
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work
on something good, you know?

202
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,202
Oh?

203
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:41,039
Although I gotta hand it to your husband.
It has been a really painless shoot,

204
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,208
even though the movie's gonna be
a piece of shit, right?

205
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,461
-What?
-Oh, you said "piece of ship," right?

206
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,795
Like shipshape? [giggles]

207
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,131
Anyway, what were we talking about?
Who knows?

208
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,966
-Okay, moving on.
-Hey, it's fine.

209
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,385
Abe knows what we're making.

210
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:54,969
Right?

211
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,096
[Abe slurps]

212
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,933
-Wanda, would you help me with dessert?
-Uh, okay.

213
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,272
Yeah.
New York is so great in the summer,

214
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,649
but I don't think
we're going to be done in time.

215
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,860
We're looking at a ton of reshoots.

216
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,779
-Are you kidding?
-Well, you know,

217
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,907
because the movie's such a piece of shit
and all.

218
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,534
Did that hurt your feelings?

219
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,370
I mean, you're the one who said
we're not making <i>Casablanca.</i>

220
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,707
Right, because <i>Casablanca </i>is a movie
about a club owner named Rick.

221
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,377
This movie's about Secretariat,
a racehorse.

222
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:32,757
Wait, you literally meant we're not making
the actual movie <i>Casablanca?</i>

223
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,761
That movie already exists.
Why would we make <i>Casablanca?</i>

224
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,515
-This is a different movie.
-I think there was a misunderstanding.

225
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,768
Wrong, boy-o.
There was a mister-understanding.

226
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,439
And that mister is me
understanding you just fine.

227
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,983
You come into my home
and you call my work shit?

228
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,026
-You know what I think? You're shit.
-What?

229
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,155
You think I don't get enough takes?
I'll get more takes.

230
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,657
Just wait, see how many takes I can get.

231
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,912
Well, don't go.
We haven't had dessert yet.

232
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,624
Shirley's lemon meringue? Mwah.

233
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,376
I mean, it's no banana cream pie.

234
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,588
Because it's a different kind of pie?

235
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,798
[slurs] That's right.

236
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,969
Why did you have to antagonize him?

237
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,762
I wasn't trying to antagonize him.

238
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,099
-He said, "It's no <i>Casablanca."</i>
-Well, what's done is done.

239
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,644
You're happy.
You didn't want me to go to New York.

240
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,145
Lucky me, I get to stay here

241
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,564
and work on this movie
that's gonna ruin my career.

242
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,690
There's no reason to sulk about it, right?

243
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,153
Or you could sulk about it.

244
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,821
Diane does raise some good points.

245
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:37,822
No, she doesn't.

246
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,993
Besides, I don't think Diane's the person
you wanna be going to for life advice now.

247
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,497
Why? Just because I've been drinking
myself to sleep on your deck chairs

248
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:49,708
and lying to my husband for the last week?
Hey, there's a Cheez-It on the shelf.

249
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,961
I knew I kept these things around
for a reason.

250
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,217
-I just had the most amazing prov sesh.
-No one cares, Todd.

251
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,011
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice?
Make a suggestion.

252
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,763
-Stop.
-Aah. Sorry, officer,

253
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,183
I didn't see that stop sign.

254
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,643
Yes.

255
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,061
And my car runs on farts.

256
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,020
-[Todd mimics farting]
-[Wanda] Ugh!

257
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,105
-Stop. No, stop it.
-Please stop.

258
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,315
Not a suggestion.

259
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,316
[mimics farting]

260
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,735
Okay.
I just hope I impress the elder council.

261
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,572
I want to become a Level Two,

262
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:23,410
so I can finally achieve clarity
on the Mainstage with the chosen ones.

263
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,328
Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.

264
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,955
What? No, improv is not a cult.

265
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,874
It's just a dogmatic school of thought

266
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,126
taught by a for-profit organization

267
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,004
with the promise of social
and professional opportunities.

268
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,716
-Ahh.
-It's a cult. And I know.

269
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,969
I learned a little about cults
during that year I was a Scientologist.

270
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,723
Coincidentally during that year,
I read a book about cults.

271
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,807
Wait, are you saying
Scientology is a cult?

272
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,810
No, Scientology is not a cult.

273
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,354
Improv is a cult.

274
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,275
I wanna be very clear.
This is about improv.

275
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,945
-I really don't think it's that bad, guys.
-Why does anything matter, right?

276
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,197
Love is an illusion,
and happiness is fleeting,

277
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,659
no such thing as God, and all your
favorite musicians beat their wives.

278
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,745
Allegedly.

279
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,580
Would you talk to her?

280
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,623
[sighs] Yes.

281
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:13,710
Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.

282
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,504
Heyyy... Hitler.

283
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,505
Please stop.

284
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,798
[panting]

285
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:24,011
President Lohan!
Get away from that fire hose!

286
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,430
[all] Fire hose!

287
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,390
[grunts] Sorry I'm late, guys!

288
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,477
Todd, we take tardiness seriously here
at Shenanigags.

289
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,981
-If you miss one more class, you're out.
-I'm sorry. But, wait, Bryan isn't here.

290
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,109
-He's later than I am.
-Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.

291
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,862
He's been negative, so Copernicus thought
he could benefit from some time away.

292
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,575
He's been reassigned to the Shenanigags
comedy cruise line, the <i>Giggleship.</i>

293
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,245
-Is that a reward or a punishment?
-That's up to Bryan.

294
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,665
Let's have no more questions
about the <i>Giggleship.</i>

295
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,500
Oh, uh, all right.

296
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,503
Well, you know,
I was actually talking to my best friend,

297
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,756
and he said improv is a cult.

298
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,675
I mean, that's crazy, right?

299
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,679
[all laughing]

300
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,096
[coughs]

301
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,016
If you think Shenanigags is a cult,
you're free to go, Todd.

302
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,686
Oh, no. I don't wanna go.
I love this place.

303
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,689
My friend just doesn't know
how great you guys are.

304
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,608
It sounds like your friend's
not yes-and'ing you.

305
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,401
Invite him to your graduation show.

306
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,946
If he's too negative to support you,
you should take a good hard think

307
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,658
about if that's the kind of energy
you want in your life.

308
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:30,328
[groans] I hate good hard thinks.

309
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,376
I love you, too, Mr. Peanutbutter.
But I-- I gotta go.

310
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,379
I'm--
Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.

311
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,215
The kids get jealous
if I'm talking on the phone.

312
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,466
Uh, okay, bye.

313
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,843
So, hey, hi.

314
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,095
How long are you thinking of staying here?
Just for my own reference.

315
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,265
Oh, shit.
Is Wanda making you get rid of me?

316
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,933
No one is making me do anything.

317
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,102
Except keep acting in this movie you hate.

318
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,062
Well, yeah.

319
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,983
I really thought I could do it. I thought
I could go far away and help people

320
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,528
and be this best possible version
of myself.

321
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,612
And what happened?

322
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,280
I couldn't.

323
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,575
I wasn't the person I thought I was.

324
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,828
I'd love to stay and wallow with you,
but I gotta head out.

325
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,874
Today we're filming what used to be the
scene where Secretariat commits suicide,

326
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,376
but is now a scene where he swims
in a fishing hole

327
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,087
-with his girlfriend "Susie Side."
-Yeesh.

328
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,340
If you wanna blow off work,
I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch,

329
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,051
drink beer, and watch old episodes
of <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

330
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:27,968
Hmm.

331
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,220
[audience laughs]

332
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,514
And if I hear one more peep out of you--

333
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,391
-[crashing]
-[audience laughs]

334
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,895
-Sabrina!
-[Sabrina] What? I didn't peep!

335
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,855
Oh!

336
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,189
[audience applauding]

337
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,650
Sabrina was such a little bitch.

338
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,194
She was an orphan. She had a tough life.

339
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,823
Hey, Diane, you're still here.
And BoJack is here.

340
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,074
Did you go to work today?

341
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,786
I was gonna, but then I remembered
everything is garbage,

342
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,203
so why bother doing anything?

343
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,497
-True story.
-Okay.

344
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,458
[the horse]<i> Oh, you didn't.</i>

345
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,709
[audience laughing]

346
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,711
<i>Oh, you did.</i>

347
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,337
[sitcom theme plays over TV]

348
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,843
-Hello.
-Hey, could you get the door?

349
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,637
-Whoa.
-Mm.

350
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,473
The property's gonna be ready in June.
Gives us two months

351
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,558
to get everything we need
out of this place.

352
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,476
Mm. Perfect.

353
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,520
Just so you know, I had to register
the corporation in your name.

354
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,606
-What?
-Just until the divorce is finalized.

355
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,983
Katie's lawyers are watching me closely
right now.

356
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,984
They're hawks.

357
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,194
I mean, not literally.
Well, one literally.

358
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,238
Know what, actually, he might be a falcon.

359
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,448
Rutabaga, this is too--

360
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,909
This is a temporary technicality,
I promise.

361
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,578
I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag.
Okay?

362
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,496
Mm. Mm.

363
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,165
Hey, your assistant wasn't out there,
so I just-- Ooh.

364
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,000
-Oh, hello.
-Look at this urn.

365
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,794
What's going on in here?

366
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,504
Mr. Peanutbutter, shut the door.

367
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:49,884
Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency,
and we want you to come with us.

368
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,137
Well, well, well, what delicious irony.

369
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,516
It appears the cat is chasing the dog.

370
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,684
Are you in or out?

371
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,685
Are you kidding?

372
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,855
You're the agent who got me
<i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities.</i>

373
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,272
-Well--
-<i>What do they know?</i>

374
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,899
-Right, so--
-<i>Do they know things?</i>

375
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,275
-Okay--
-<i>Let's find out.</i>

376
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,694
-Right--
-Big fan.

377
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,987
I like you guys.

378
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,656
I like your hustle
and I like your matching lipstick.

379
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,199
-Well, um--
-I am in.

380
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,367
Mm-hm.

381
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,079
<i>Go home, Goober.</i>

382
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,289
Yeah! Go home, Goober!

383
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,250
[coughs] Goober sucks.
Why doesn't he ever go home?

384
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,378
Yeah, Goober's the one who should go home.

385
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,672
-You suck, Goober!
-Hey, Goober! Get murdered!

386
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,174
Go sit on a sharp dick, you piece of shit.

387
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,927
-Hey, guys.
-Shut up, Todd.

388
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,388
BoJack, listen, I-- Oh!

389
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,765
-Hey, whoa!
-Boo! Party foul!

390
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,018
-You knocked over Bucking-can Palace.
-Come on!

391
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,936
Uh, sorry, I'll clean that up later.

392
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,565
Listen to this guy, "clean it up later."
Hasn't picked up his shit in years.

393
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,900
Clean up your shit, Todd.

394
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,696
BoJack, I wanted to invite you
to my graduation show tomorrow night.

395
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,698
-What?
-Look, I know you think

396
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,910
it's just a dumb cult,
but you're my best friend

397
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,620
and it would really mean a lot
if you came.

398
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:04,333
[groans] I'm gonna go down to the basement
to practice my space work.

399
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,504
And here I am going downstairs.

400
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,757
[cell phone ringing]

401
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,674
Hello?

402
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,803
-What kind of pants are you wearing now?
-What? I don't know. The normal kind.

403
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,765
Yeah? Mm. Are they comfy?
A comfy pair of pants?

404
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,391
I guess. Why?

405
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,810
Just wondering
what kind of hit you're gonna take

406
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:26,272
when the studio sues the pants off you
for breach of contract.

407
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,108
They're suing me?
Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes?

408
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,360
Because that was a long road to walk
to get to that punch line.

409
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,738
-This is serious.
-We're not just doing bits?

410
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,489
You started it with the pants thing.

411
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,118
You need to go back to set.
You can't just not go to work.

412
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,119
[sighs]

413
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,329
<i>Remember, you wanted this.</i>

414
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,295
Are you saying you're finally ready
to settle down with yours truly?

415
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,881
Darn tootin'.
I may be a professional racehorse,

416
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,633
but I'm tired of running in circles.

417
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,550
[Abe] Cut!

418
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,261
Perfect.
But let's get that last part again.

419
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:02,391
-Anything you want me to do differently?
-No, I just think we should get it again.

420
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,268
You know, for safety.

421
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,146
-Action!
-I'm tired of running in circles.

422
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,815
[slurps] And again?

423
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,566
I'm tired of running in circles.

424
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,152
Why don't we get it like five more times?

425
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,154
I'm tired of running in circles.

426
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,364
I'm tired of running in circles.

427
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,575
I'm tired of running in circles.

428
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,786
I'm tired of running in circles.

429
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,830
I'm tired of running in circles.

430
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,082
[Abe] Let's get it ten more times.

431
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,166
[sighs]

432
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,713
-Ta-da!
-We did it.

433
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,091
-What now?
-We die, have our guts ripped out

434
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,094
through our noses,
and get enshrined inside of it. Duh.

435
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,262
Hey, BoJack,
can I talk to you for a minute?

436
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,473
Ooh...

437
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,683
Alone, please?

438
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,560
Oh...

439
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,896
So, good news. We're gonna go on a trip.

440
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,356
-Right now. You and me.
-What?

441
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,442
I booked us a room for the weekend.
Pack your bags, let's go.

442
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,694
Where? Why?

443
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,070
Less asking, more basking.

444
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,280
In the sun, that is. Santa Barbara.

445
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,992
-I'm not really in the mood for--
-I think some time away

446
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,577
could be really good for us, as a couple.

447
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,537
Oh.

448
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,247
I know you've been really bummed out
about the movie,

449
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:11,251
but I don't think moping around the house
with Diane all day is healthy.

450
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,004
All I've ever wanted
was to be in this movie,

451
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,131
and you just want me
to put on a happy face--

452
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,718
Yes. There are lots of people
who don't like their jobs.

453
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,012
Doesn't mean
they have to bring it home with--

454
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,682
-Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
-What is that supposed to mean?

455
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,976
Well, come on.
You're a network executive.

456
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,728
You don't give a shit about work.

457
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,564
I actually have a lot of pride
in what I do.

458
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,149
What? You have a lot of pride?

459
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,693
Your job is to pump out garbage every year

460
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,404
hoping some of the garbage
stinks less than the rest

461
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,699
so you can quietly renew that garbage
and keep failing sideways

462
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,410
until you retire
to a three-point-five bedroom garbage

463
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,245
in Beverly Garbage
and spend the rest of your life

464
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,499
-watching your former assistant's garbage.
-I don't know where this is coming from.

465
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,586
Every good thing
that ever happened to you happened

466
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,755
because of network executives like me.

467
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,883
That show you spend all day watching,
your house, your career--

468
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,595
Great house, great career, great life!
Must be why I'm so happy all the time!

469
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,097
-You don't know--
-I don't?

470
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,934
My life was ruined
by a network executive like you.

471
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,938
Well, I'm sorry
that things have been so hard for you,

472
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,900
but that doesn't give you the right to be
shitty to me. I can't be around someone

473
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,819
who's just fueled
by bitterness and negativity.

474
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,405
Well then, what are you doing here?

475
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,033
What happened, BoJack?

476
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,660
Same thing that always happens.

477
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,705
You didn't know me.
Then you fell in love with me.

478
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,791
And now you know me.

479
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:38,131
You know, it's funny. When you look
at someone through rose-colored glasses,

480
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,008
all the red flags just look like flags.

481
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,017
-So, Wanda's moving out.
-Oh, shit. Because of me?

482
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,685
No. Because of me.

483
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,189
I'm sorry. You wanna watch another episode
of <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

484
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:58,776
Where Olivia does the school project
where she pretends an egg is a baby.

485
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,737
Spoiler alert:
Ethan needs to make an omelet.

486
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,739
Why won't you go home?

487
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,617
I should. I know I should.

488
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,703
I wish I could just go home right now
and crawl into bed

489
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,499
and not have to talk about anything
or explain anything.

490
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,585
He would just say, "How was your day?"
And then he would say,

491
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,672
"Hey, did you know the monorail
was invented by George Monorail?"

492
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,799
And I would say,
"I don't think that's true."

493
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,385
And he would say, "Well, if he didn't
invent it, he certainly perfected it."

494
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,346
And I wouldn't have to say,
"I'm sorry I left.

495
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,516
I'm sorry I made things so difficult.

496
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,352
I'm sorry I'm not the person
I thought I was."

497
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,231
I would just say, "My day was good."

498
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,859
And he would say, "I love you."

499
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,280
The longer you keep lying to him,
the harder it's gonna get.

500
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,490
Can I ask you something?

501
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,077
That play in New York,
would that really have made you happy?

502
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:53,164
Yeah. I mean, for a little bit.

503
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,707
And if Kelsey didn't get fired,

504
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,084
and you got to make the movie
you wanted to make,

505
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,752
would that have made you happy?

506
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,129
For a little bit.

507
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,463
But then...

508
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,174
Probably...

509
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,219
So, what does it matter?

510
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,263
But there has to be more.

511
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:13,433
Well, when's the last time
you were actually happy?

512
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,157
You microchipped my penis? Check, please!

513
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,367
[all] Microchip.

514
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,035
[laughs]

515
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,078
Ah.

516
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,205
[audience applauding]

517
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,083
[sighs]

518
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,921
[doorbell rings]

519
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,798
Oh.

520
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:49,887
[all] Todd!

521
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,347
-[Todd groans]
-[all laughing]

522
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,807
[laughs] Yeah.

523
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,396
Oh.

524
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,564
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

525
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,358
Hey. How are you?

526
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,402
I can't do this anymore.

527
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,570
You can't do what anymore?

528
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,323
I can't talk to you on the phone
all the time.

529
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,616
It's too hard.

530
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,534
Uh, have you tried Bluetooth?

531
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,746
I think maybe we should stop
calling each other, for a little bit.

532
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,958
I'm sorry. I just miss you too much.

533
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,002
But listen, I love you. Okay?

534
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,254
Mr. Peanutbutter?

535
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,548
Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.

536
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,758
I love you, Diane.

537
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,886
-Where is he?
-I don't know, sir.

538
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,764
Can't do this to me. Where the hell is he?
