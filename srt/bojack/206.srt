As your accountant,
I felt it necessary to do this in person.

Whatever it is, it hasn't happened.
Nothing has ever happened to me.

00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,614
-You say you love a toasted bagel.
-I would never say that.

-I have celiac disease.
-Ding. Bagel's ready.

-But wait.
-Son of a--

11

-Hey. That bagel was too fast.
-No.

That's why PB Livin' presents,

13
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,795
-For all those hard-to-catch bagels.
-No, no. Stop. Enough. Enough.

I don't get what's happening.

18
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,057
What's happening is you two knuckleheads
threw thousands of dollars

into a bunch of dumb ideas.

20
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:02,604

to the game "tag."

22

Our business manager
was over the moon for that.

Business manager?
Who the hell is your business manager?

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,616

like appropriate business.

-Are you hiring at your accounting firm?
-Dude, no.

I'm waiting for my agent.
He'll be with me any moment.

Mr. Peanutbutter is going back to work.

33
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:49,068
Yeah. He's probably just organizing
all the amazing opportunities.

34
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,738
I haven't heard from him in years,
so they've probably been piling up.

35
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,824
Maybe I should just go check on him.

Here's a funny question for you:

If Mr. Peanutbutter said,
"I love you. No, I don't,"

127
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,212
would you need to talk about that later
and figure out what he meant?

128
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,964
Probably not, right?
Because they're meaningless words?

129
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,632
I mean, language evolves, right?

130

How can anyone know
what anything means?

131
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,887
The answer is nobody can.
Nothing means anything.

132
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,764
So why bother talking about anything?

133
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,850
In this scenario, are Mr. Peanutbutter
and I living in our house?

00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,478

-You seem a little stressed out.

Also to reach out to his former clients.

166
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,902
-To offer their condolences?
-Yes.

167
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,738
Also to recruit them to the Vigor roster.

168
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:54,159
-A Vigor agent is a vigorous agent.
-Who do you want me to call?

169
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:58,163
I have ins with a bunch of Bonito's
clients including all the major J's:

170
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:02,250
-Law, Lo, Leno, and J. Abrams.
-Oh, that's wonderful news

171
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,628
in the parallel universe
in which you were on time today.

172
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,548
In this reality, however, we're all good.

173
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,884
You can lap up the leftovers though.

174
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,594
-"Mr. Peanutbutter"?
-Oh, and Princess Carolyn?

175
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,929
Get your shoe fixed.

176
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,974
You look like a woman
from an '80s deodorant commercial.

177
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,105
[inhales sharply]

178
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:28,276
Here I go.
Destiny, don't fail me now. [grunts]

179
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,739
Yeah. Hitting the pavement.

180
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,200
This is how it happens for a guy like me.

181
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,750
[grunts] Ew...

182
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,044
Out of my way, flyer.

183
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,965
Ugh. Flyer. Why do you have to be
on my shoe in front of this store?

184
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,552
Wait, a second. Shoe.

185
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,262
Store.

186
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,889
Shoe store? Shoe store.

187
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,599
"Team players wanted"?

188
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,684
Oh, I'm such a good team player,

189
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,771
I make all the other team players
look like garbage.

190
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:08,108
Lady Footlocker, meet your lord.

191
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,698
Finish... [grunts]

192
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,369
line.

193
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,414
Great, we got it. We got one take.

194
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,165
And now we gotta stop for the day.

195
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,459
What? No. Why stop now?

196
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,212
-I'm just getting warmed up.
-Union rules. We're done. Go home.

197
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,464
Go home?

198
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,426
Why go home when we could extend
this long day's journey into night?

199
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,095
-Drinks on me, folks.
-I could use a drink.

200
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,764
-Or six.
-Great, Corduroy's driving. Let's go.

201
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,435
[Corduroy] Ah...

202
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,562
-I really needed this, BoJack.
-Me, too.

203
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,814
Yeah, man.
This day's been really hard on me.

204
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,067
Ever since I heard about that agent
who died from that blue-face blastoff?

205
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,069
-Blue-face blastoff?
-The strokey chokey?

206
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,571
-The two-neck squeeze?
-What?

207
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,864
You know, the one hand
on the Adam's apple,

208
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,033
the other one's
on the Adam's banana?

209
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,287
Oh, right. Right. Yeah. The auto-erotic--

210
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,206
That could've been me.
I used to really be into that stuff.

211
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,791
I was a hardcore gasper.

212
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,585
Can't believe you have
so many names for it.

213
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,337
Now I can't stop thinking about it.

214
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,589
I shouldn't even be alive right now.

215
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,341
Don't need to talk about
how you masturbate.

216
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,635
-The orgasms you get--
-Okay, I guess we do.

217
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,429
It's like seeing a rainbow,
but with all the colors.

218
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,140
-So, like a normal rainbow?
-But it's too dangerous, man.

219
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,352
They say if you bite down on a lemon
right at the point of climax,

220
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,771
the lemon juice gives you the jolt
you need to not pass out and die.

221
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:33,026
But still man,
you're just... rolling the dice.

222
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,195
Okay, this is getting really graphic.

223
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,988
Can we maybe
talk about anything else?

224
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,697
-Sure.
-Thank God.

225
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:43,328
Hey, man, it's funny you should mention
God, because my new thing is... the Bible.

226
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,454
Uh...

227
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:48,791
Tell me, have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your Lord and personal savior?

228
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,086
So, noose-wise, what are we talking?
You use a standard sailor's knot

229
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,088
or more like your average
birthday-present bow?

230
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,803
[grunting softly]

231
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,306
[sighs]

232
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,975
-I beeped you, BoJack.
-Oh, hey. About this morning--

233
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,977
-It's fine.
-Because when I said that--

234
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,355
I said it's fine. You don't love me.

235
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,191
That's okay. I don't love you.

236
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,776
-What?
-Good night.

237
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,363
[upbeat theme music playing]

238
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,240
{\an8}[in unison]
Morning time, Hollywoo.

239
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,410
{\an8}-I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
-And I'm Some Lady.

240
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,496
{\an8}On today's show,
I sit down with Hank Hippopopalous

241
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,916
to discuss his new smash hit,
<i>Hey, I Think You Can Dance.</i>

242
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,834
Can you talk about your process?

243
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,087
{\an8}When I see someone,
and I think they can dance,

244
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,048
{\an8}I say,
"Hey, I think you can dance."

245
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:41,428
And when I think they can't dance,
I say, "No, I don't think you can dance."

246
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,222
<i>-And that is pretty much it.</i>
<i>-Fascinating.</i>

247
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,351
-So, last night when--
-BoJack, it's not a big deal.

248
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,270
You don't love me, I don't love you.

249
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,522
We're having a good time. It's fine.

250
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,691
Can't just say, "I don't love you"
to someone.

251
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,110
-You said it to me.
-Yeah, but that was different.

252
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,778
-How was that different?
-Because you do love me. Right?

253
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,489
-Like a little bit?
-No.

254
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,825
Uh, for what it's worth,
I love both you guys.

255
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,120
Shut up, Todd. Grown-ups are talking.

256
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,585
Here you go, ma'am.

257
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,420
[women laughing and chattering]

258
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,299
Jessica Atkinson, come on down.

259
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,592
Mr. Peanutbutter?

260
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,513
Would you like to see what's in
box number one or box number two?

261
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:29,726
Either way,
it's a brand-new pair of shoes!

262
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,269
[women clapping and laughing]

263
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,022
Oh.

264
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,317
Hup. Carolyn.

265
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,693
-Rutabaga--
-Coffee?

266
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,819
I was thinking about you last night

267
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,616
while Katie and I were locked in a
fascinating debate about counter granite.

268
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,994
And what if I told you I used to work
Ronnie Bonito's desk,

269
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,038
and I happen to know
that he had a client so hush-hush,

270
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:55,460
-it wasn't even on the master list.
-What? Who? Tell me. Whoa!

271
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,377
[alarm ringing]

272
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,881
Beloved novelist J.D. Salinger. What?

273
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,134
The author of <i>Catcher in the Rye?</i>

274
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,595
-And... others?
-Yuh-huh.

275
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,014
-Isn't he dead?
-He's "reclusive."

276
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,268
Dude wanted to be left alone so much,
he faked his own death.

277
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,561
Oh, my God.

278
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,313
Why are you giving this lead to me?

279
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,940
-Because I like you, dummy.
-Huh.

280
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,653
Now we gotta wait for the fire department
to come let us out of this elevator.

281
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,242
-Hey.
-Corduroy, what are you doing here?

282
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,495
I need a favor.
Can you hold on to this for me?

283
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,955
-Ew. Is this your Bible?
-No, no, no.

284
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,041
-It's my choking-off kit.
-Your kit?

285
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,501
Yeah. It has all my supplies.

286
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,629
Silk ties, a leather gag, velvet sock.
Lemon.

287
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,716
You gotta take this off my hands.
I can't trust myself with this.

288
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,843
I don't know if I want
your jack-off kit at my house.

289
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,053
Please. I got this girlfriend.
She loves me.

290
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,348
If I fall back into the old gasp-and-goo,
it'll break her heart.

291
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,184
Wait. So, you're saying
if someone loves you,

292
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,895
they don't want you to choke yourself
while masturbating?

293
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,856
Yeah. It's really dangerous.

294
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,982
-All right. I'll take it.
-Thanks, BoJack.

295
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,068
I still don't understand
why you need a kit.

296
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,111
Can't you just use,
like, a belt or a rope?

297
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,113
Oh, I guess.

298
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,032
I mean, I guess you could use anything.

299
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:12,203
I mean, you could use an iPhone charger,
a shoelace, a necktie, a jump-rope...

300
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,669
[Carolyn] Hm...

301
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,508
Oh. Ooh.

302
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,678
-Oh, hello. I'm looking for some--
-Sorry, no looking allowed.

303
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,388
This store is for customers only.

304
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,016
Okay, then, I would like to buy a bicycle.
What would you recommend?

305
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,143
-One with a bell, or--?
-You got me.

306
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:40,356
I don't know anything about bicycles.
I'm J.D. Salinger. I faked my own death.

307
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,152
Mr. Salinger. Such a pleasure.
Princess Carolyn, big fan.

308
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,154
Let me guess, <i>Catcher in the Rye?</i>

309
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,989
And others.

310
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,910
-I wanna say <i>The Hobbi--</i>
-Nope.

311
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,369
Look. I'm an agent.

312
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,538
It doesn't matter
whether I've read your work.

313
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,667
What matters is I can look you
in the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.

314
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,670
The world is ready for your comeback,
and I wanna help.

315
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,130
No, thank you. Not interested.

316
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,006
Did that before, didn't work out well.

317
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,175
Fans were relentless.
The critics were cruel.

318
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,554
And that's why my motto is,
"It's better to be alone."

319
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,264
Which, come to think of it,

320
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,934
is probably why I don't sell
a lot of tandem bicycles.

321
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,853
But, J.D. Salinger,
you are J.D. Salinger.

322
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,939
You are a goddamn American treasure.

323
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,567
But every time I go out in the world,
people hound me about my books.

324
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,235
Well, book.

325
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,280
What if I told you there was a place
where no one reads books?

326
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,531
I'm listening.

327
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,701
A place where people only read
headlines, lists and pictures.

328
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,120
A place where people
hate reading so much,

329
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,791
they hire others to do it for them
and don't even pay a living wage.

330
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,752
What do you mean,
like, modern reading slaves?

331
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,044
Exactly.

332
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,756
And all those modern reading slaves
really wanna be doing

333
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,384
is writing things that, one day,
other people will also avoid reading.

334
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,013
-Does such a place truly exist?
-Come with me, J.D. Salinger.

335
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,890
Let's go to Hollywoo.

336
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,439
Hup!

337
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,777
Oh... [sighs]

338
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,195
-Hey.
-Hey.

339
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,947
-We need to talk.
-Okay.

340
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,116
You're probably wondering
what this beautiful mahogany box is.

341
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,537
-I wasn't wondering that.
-It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit.

342
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,998
I've decided to do the funky Spider-Man.

343
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,834
-What? Funky Spider-Man?
-I came up with that one myself.

344
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,752
Because he hangs,
then he shoots webbing.

345
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,548
Wait. Are you saying you want to
auto-erotic asphyxiate yourself?

346
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,883
Yes. I do.

347
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,509
Even though it's very dangerous

348
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,177
-and I could die.
-Oh.

349
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,472
Now, if you love me, you probably
wouldn't want me to do it.

350
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,767
-Okay. I get it.
-Since you don't, I should do it, right?

351
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,770
I mean, there's no reason not to...
unless you love me.

352
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,313
-Do it.
-Wait. Seriously?

353
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,065
Seems like you've already
made up your mind.

354
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,234
If you're that set on it,
knock yourself out.

355
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,945
[laughs] Only if I do it wrong.

356
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,656
Because as I mentioned before,
it's very dangerous.

357
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,075
-Have fun.
-I'm serious. I'm really gonna do it.

358
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,453
Great. Put a towel down.
Not one of the good ones.

359
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,830
[upbeat theme music playing]

360
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,832
{\an8}[in unison]
Morning time, Hollywoo.

361
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,667
{\an8}I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

362
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,087
{\an8}And I'm An Actress Or Something,
I don't know, sitting in for Some Lady.

363
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,798
-Whoa. What happened to her?
-She got kidnapped.

364
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,299
Oh, boy.

365
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,720
[laughs] <i>Oh, my. Ooh, wow.</i>

366
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,015
Oh, hey. Look who survived
to masturbate another day.

367
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,892
Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously.

368
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,810
If I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna go all out.

369
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,855
A big job like that needs lumber,
and pulleys, lemons, so forth.

370
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,275
I'm not gonna half-ass anything.
This is my orgasm we're talking about.

371
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,569
Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.

372
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,947
-Not too late to stop me.
-I'm not gonna stop you.

373
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,198
-Good 'cause don't.
-All right, we're in agreement.

374
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,700
Stop fighting!

375
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,869
Can't you two see
what this is doing to me?

376
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,329
I've been acting out. [grunts]

377
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,749
Have a great day.

378
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,500
Todd? Get in the car.

379
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,462
It's time to get serious
about auto-erotic asphyxiation.

380
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,840
Hooray! Question mark?

381
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,722
Just play it cool, Todd.
No one needs to know why we're here.

382
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,101
Excuse me, I'm looking for something
that will hold up a lot of weight.

383
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,021
Let's say something that could hoist up
a horse comfortably by the neck.

384
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,482
Not for suicide purposes.

385
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,276
I'm trying to have
a more fulfilling orgasm.

386
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:19,033
The world wept when news broke
that J.D. Salinger died.

387
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,996
-[gasps] J.D. Salinger died?
-But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.

388
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,914
[gasps] J.D. Salinger didn't die?

389
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,001
As one of the 20th century's
most celebrated authors,

390
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,045
J.D. Salinger has inspired
countless dreamers,

391
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,339
eighth graders
and occasionally, assassins.

392
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,467
His spare lyricism
and devotion to character

393
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,262
will undoubtedly translate into
a penetrating dramatic work for this,

394
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,515
the golden age of television writing.

395
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,391
J.D. Take it away.

396
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:48,855
I wanna do a show where people
ask celebrities trivia questions.

397
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,439
-What?
-Like a game show?

398
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,859
Yeah. You know because
since they're famous people,

399
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,154
I think normal people would wanna see
if they know trivia and stuff.

400
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,991
You know, like, Hollywoo stars
and celebrities, what do they know?

401
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,160
Do they know things? Let's find out.

402
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,830
What a hoot. I love it, and I don't
use that word with just anybody.

403
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,831
What do you call it?

404
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:10,334
I call it <i>Hollywoo Stars and</i>
<i>Celebrities: What Do They Know?</i>

405
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,586
<i>Do They Know Things?</i>
<i>Let's Find Out.</i>

406
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,380
It's maybe more of a working title.

407
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,256
I can see it on the marquee already.

408
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,092
-Must be a long marquee.
-It's long.

409
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:21,054
Yeah, yeah. The celebrities
can also do physical challenges.

410
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:21,971
Oh, it's perfect.

411
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,265
We've been searching for a companion
for <i>Hey, I Think You Can Dance.</i>

412
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,727
But wait, wait one second.
Who's gonna host?

413
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,771
Huh. I've got the perfect guy.

414
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,067
Who wants to be in Nike Airs?

415
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,862
Claire, you are looking off the charts
"gorge" in those tennis shoes.

416
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,699
But let me ask you this:
Would you like to buy a towel?

417
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,535
Because I'm throwing one in for free.

418
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,495
-He's perfect.
-[Wanda] Mm-hm.

419
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,955
Mr. Peanutbutter?

420
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:53,044
How would you like to be the host of
J.D. Salinger's new celebrity game show?

421
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,422
What? I knew destiny had a plan for me.

422
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,340
You know, it just goes to show,

423
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,135
with the right attitude,
every single one of your dreams

424
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,762
will always come true.

425
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,471
And if your dreams don't come true,

426
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:08,350
it's probably because you just
didn't have the right attitude.

427
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,233
Today, one agent did something
that no one else could.

428
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,236
I'll give you two hints: catcher and rye.

429
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,196
Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.

430
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,366
Charley Witherspoon caught a rye bagel
coming out of the toaster.

431
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,411
-Come again?
-It was coming fast and hot.

432
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:31,165
One day, some genius will invent
some sort of bagel catcher

433
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,251
that takes the guesswork out of this task,

434
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,503
but until then, Charley gets a gold star.

435
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:40,883
-Thanks, Dad. I mean, Mr. Dad.
-Oh...

436
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,346
Oh, boy.

437
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,182
Hey. Wasn't sure if I'd see you.

438
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:51,769
Still alive? Because auto-erotic
asphyxiation is so risky?

439
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,437
Well, here I am, for now.

440
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,149
BoJack... Wait.
Did you fix the bed?

441
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,817
Yeah. I was at the hardware store

442
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,237
picking up supplies for my auto-erotic
asphyxiation machine.

443
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,571
Because, as you are aware,

444
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,825
I'm preparing to auto-erotic
asphyxiate myself.

445
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,829
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you
could at least get a good night's sleep.

446
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,747
Okay, BoJack.

447
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,833
Wanna talk about
the elephant in the room?

448
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,253
Wow. Okay. You know what?

449
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,922
You know what? Here's-- First of all--

450
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:24,302
Wow. All right, I can't even-- [groans]

451
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,054
You know what? I-- [scoffs]

452
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:27,972
Wow.

453
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,890
He is never gonna forget that.

454
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,142
What is this all about?

455
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,061
This isn't about anything but
the pursuit of the kind of orgasm

456
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,354
that feels like a rainbow
with every color.

457
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,024
-So, a regular rainbow.
-No.

458
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,943
So, if you don't mind,
as long as you don't love me,

459
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,361
I have a noose to step into.
[clears throat]

460
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,323
I just need to release this lever,

461
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,825
drop these bags of sand,
which act as counterweights,

462
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,328
and then just pull this nozzle.

463
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,913
-Perfect.
-Okay. Have fun.

464
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:57,168
-Wait, Wanda. [grunting and choking]
-Okay, fine, you stupid baby.

465
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,544
I love you.

466
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,964
I-- [coughs] I knew it.

467
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,467
But I'm not going to tell you
not to do the funky Spider-Man.

468
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,512
-[coughs] What?
-You need to be responsible for yourself.

469
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,388
-That doesn't sound like me.
-I know.

470
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,391
But if you love me, too,
you won't do it.

471
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,645
[gasps then grunts]

472
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,273
-I thought so.
-Okay.

473
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:22,735
Just for the record, I never really
wanted to do this in the first place,

474
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,904
Me not doing it
is not a sign that I love you.

475
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,156
-It's just because I'm a coward.
-[chuckles] Okay.

476
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,866
-I don't love you.
-Sure, you don't.

477
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,409
I don't. Come back here.
I don't love you.

478
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,537
You don't make me feel less broken.

479
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,167
I don't get it.

480
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:42,796
I singlehandedly got a Lady Footlocker
store employee a primetime show

481
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,218
and resurrected a certified dead man
and nobody cared.

482
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,012
-Why do I do anything?
-[Rutabaga over phone] <i>Hey.</i>

483
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,223
Do you need the movie star speech?

484
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,225
[sighs] Yeah.

485
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,937
Okay.
Carolyn, you are the star of a movie.

486
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,940
This is the part of the movie
where you get your heart broken.

487
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,901
<i>Where the world tests you,</i>
<i>and people treat you like shit.</i>

488
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,569
But it has to happen this way.

489
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,154
Otherwise, the end of the movie,

490
