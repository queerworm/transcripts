Oh, also a water. I am parched.

163
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,711
In fact, why don't you freeze
that water into a cube shape

164
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,505
and drop it in some bourbon.

165
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,299
We're looking to identify
an associate of Sarah Lynn's.

166
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,135
Sarah Lynn? Is this about BoJack?

167
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,970
Is it about BoJack?

168
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,723
I don't know what you're looking for,
but I don't know anything about it.

169
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,434
Okay? I haven't seen BoJack in years.
Or Sarah Lynn.

170
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,102
But you have seen them?

171
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,731
I'm gonna go ask the kitchen
about your pasta.

172
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,024
BoJack?

173
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,526
Wait, that's the fellow
from the police report,

174
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,110
who found the dead girl
in the planetarium.

175
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,530
-Yes?
-<i>Found</i> the dead girl.

176
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,323
-Are you smelling what I'm smelling?
-[snorts]

177
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,450
If he was also with her
at the AA meeting...

178
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,911
Well, then why wouldn't he mention it
to the police? What's he hiding?

179
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,746
You're starting to make more sense
than a change machine.

180
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,791
Yeah, speaking of cents,
what happened to Penny?

181
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,587
-Oh, poop! Our scoop's flown the coop!
-Go, go, go! Gotta stay in the loop!

182
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:16,347
"So in a way, that salad bowl was me,
and the cracks... were also me..."

183
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,891
-Ugh! It sucks, I'm sorry.
-It's a first draft.

184
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,936
I can't remember what happened when
and I keep getting distracted.

185
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,730
It's because of the meds.
This is what I was afraid would happen.

186
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,815
But isn't it worth it?

187
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,692
You've been feeling
so much better, right?

188
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,237
I do feel lighter, and clearer,
but also so foggy.

189
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,574
You feel clear and foggy?
How is that even possible?

190
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,827
-I don't know! Because of the fog.
-Hey. Stick with it.

191
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,830
-With the writing? Or the fog?
-Both.

192
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,168
{\an8}Okay. So, start at the beginning.

193
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,086
{\an8}I'm a baby.

194
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,879
{\an8}[Todd] Hey, baby!

195
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:53,384
Isn't it great to grow up in a comfortable
upper-middle class home,

196
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,719
surrounded by love?

197
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,763
{\an8}But I didn't grow up surrounded by love.
That's the problem.

198
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,142
You were fine!
Name one example of me being a bad dad.

199
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:05,271
Uh, okay! What about how you made me lose
on purpose at Boggle

200
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:09,191
{\an8}so my brothers would think they were,
quote, "wicked smarter than a girl."

201
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,444
-That's all you got?
-I got other things!

202
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,406
There was lots of shit. Constantly!
I just can't express--

203
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:19,118
Is this what your book is?
Just you complaining?

204
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,079
As your target audience,
I'm not hooked yet.

205
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,539
You are not my target audience.

206
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,042
[Ivy] This book is like bore me
with a spoon, Diane.

207
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,752
You know the story about Gemberly, right?

208
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,712
-What they found in her locker?
-Tell me.

209
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,632
It was a note from the thief,
saying where all the wallets were hidden.

210
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,384
What? What is this? I'm trying to write
about my childhood trauma.

211
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,053
-Who are you?
-I'm Ivy.

212
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,805
My mom and I just moved to Chicago
from Southern California.

213
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,015
[Diane] <i>What? No. I can't...</i>

214
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,476
My dad died and we needed a new start.

215
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,146
I don't really get Chicago yet,
and the winters are cold AF,

216
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,190
so I hang out at the mall a lot.

217
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,316
Malls are fun!

218
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,110
Or "beast," which is slang
that young people like me say.

219
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,614
-You're Ivy Tran, right?
-Ivy T. That's me!

220
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,823
I-I need help.

221
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,325
Someone's been filching onesies

222
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,160
by the twosies
from the fourth floor Baby Hole,

223
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,787
and if I don't figure out whodunnit,

224
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,997
my manager's gonna mount my head
on the wall!

225
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,917
Yes, managers can be very annoying.

226
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,043
I'll take the case.

227
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:13,005
-Oh, and, also, I'm Vietnamese-American.
-[moose] Beast.

228
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:17,218
"Ivy Tran, Food Court Detective"?

229
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,470
Well, I like this. It's fun.

230
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:23,099
My book is supposed
to be a profound treatise on damage.

231
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,976
But I can't even access my damage.
I'm too...

232
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,896
-hopped up on goof-berries!
-What the hell is a goof-berry?

233
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,732
I need to go to a dark place,
and I can't get there.

234
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,735
When I'm with you, when we're out,
I feel good, I feel happy,

235
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,278
but the minute I sit down to write--

236
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,781
 You were having trouble writing
this book when you were depressed,

237
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,866
and you're having trouble
now that you're not depressed.

238
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,660
Is it possible that you just--

239
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,121
-What? That I'm just a shitty writer?
-No.

240
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,248
That you just don't wanna write this book.

241
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,126
I do, though. It's just hard.

242
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,795
But that means it's worthwhile.
Good things are hard.

243
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,548
I'm not writing
<i>The Mall-related Mysteries of Ivy Tran!</i>

244
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,842
-[chuckles] Why not?
-Guy, come on.

245
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,677
-No. You come on.
-You come on.

246
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,180
Diane, I'm gonna tell you
what I always tell my good friend Eileen.

247
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,267
-Don't do it.
-Eileen, come on.

248
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,477
[scoffs, chuckles]

249
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,108
More drugs, please!

250
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,153
-[phone buzzes, beeps]
-Hello?

251
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,406
I soft-pitched your book
to Brad Pitt's company, Plan B,

252
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,992
and Craig Bierko's company, Plan C.

253
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,786
They're very excited
about the movie adaptation.

254
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,079
What movie adaptation?

255
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,082
Gee, I don't know,
a new Robin Hood adaptation.

256
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,752
No, Diane, the adaptation of your book!

257
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,711
What book?

258
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,589
Come to think of it, a new Robin Hood
sounds pretty good. Judah!

259
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,759
-Maybe from Maid Marian's point of view?
-Directed by Sofia Coppola?

260
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,385
I'll try Rebecca Ferguson's agent.

261
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,970
[Diane] <i>You're still on the phone with me!</i>

262
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,432
Oh, right. The town has really responded
to your pitch about damage.

263
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,850
It wasn't a pitch!

264
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,102
Imagine, all the little Dianes out there,

265
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,897
just waiting to see their story
on the big screen

266
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,608
during a brief Oscar-qualifying run
in New York and LA.

267
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,610
You don't think it's too sad, do you?

268
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,820
It wouldn't be better
if I wrote something more fun?

269
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:04,033
<i>Diane, sad is the new fun.</i>
<i>Besides, the sad is what makes it you!</i>

270
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,869
-Really?
<i>-Yes! Everyone's very excited.</i>

271
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,454
<i>But they wanna see pages.</i>

272
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,956
So, do what you do and get me that sad!

273
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,500
Just got back word from Sofia.

274
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,959
She's booked for the next year

275
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,961
developing a new <i>Peter Pan</i>
from Wendy's point of view,

276
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,589
and Rebecca's doing a limited series
about the female ticket-taker

277
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,424
at the cinema
where Batman's parents got shot.

278
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,385
Ooh, that's really empowering.
Diane, I gotta go.

279
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,556
Uh... Ngu-yen?

280
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,266
N-Ngu-yen?

281
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,352
No one?

282
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,399
[Charlotte humming]

283
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,485
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, Pen!

284
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,655
-What's wrong?
-Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.

285
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,990
A girl can't visit her mom?
Why are you grilling me?

286
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,409
Slow down. Breathe.

287
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,537
Something happened at work.

288
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,955
-Something?
-[both gasp]

289
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,624
Or someone...s?

290
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,334
Did you follow me home?

291
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,502
If you didn't wanna be followed,

292
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,629
you should have been more judicious
with the turn signal.

293
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,881
A lady doesn't need to always announce
where she's headed.

294
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,508
Yes. Who taught you how to drive?

295
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,262
-Uh, can I help you?
-Paige Sinclair, intrepid gal reporter.

296
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,264
And I'm Max!

297
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:09,849
Okay.

298
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,017
We're circling a story
on the last days of Sarah Lynn

299
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,644
and we're trying to nail down a timeline.

300
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,230
We think your BoJack Horseman
may have played a part. [snorts]

301
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,356
I think you should go.

302
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,149
Well, it was worth a try.

303
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,487
Actually, I did see Sarah Lynn.
Right before she died.

304
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,072
Oh! It was very worth a try.

305
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,116
She came to Oberlin. With BoJack.

306
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,661
-Whoa! BoJack came to Oberlin?
-And what happened?

307
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,872
-Nothing. I mean--
-Why didn't you tell me?

308
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,165
I saw them and told BoJack to leave.
That's it.

309
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,377
-Were they intoxicated?
-Is BoJack ever not intoxicated?

310
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,046
-Would you go on the record?
-No, she won't.

311
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,424
Excuse us,
we are just about to sit down to dinner.

312
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,926
Do you think BoJack got Sarah Lynn drunk?

313
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,095
Do you think BoJack got Sarah Lynn drunk?

314
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,222
-Penny--
-I'm not a kid, okay?

315
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,932
-We should tell them about Maddy.
-No--

316
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:52,850
Who's Maddy?

317
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,476
My best friend in high school.

318
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,186
BoJack was living here
and he bought her booze

319
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,439
before the prom
and then she got alcohol poisoning.

320
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,357
I'm sorry, he was living here?

321
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,692
-Oh, what's this, a party?
-[gasps]

322
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,277
Did you guys forget to invite Kyle?

323
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,863
-Dad... [sighs]
-Ah, just kidding. Now it's a party.

324
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,991
Kyle, these folks
are from the refrigerator repair company.

325
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,036
And I just told them
that our refrigerator is working fine

326
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,078
and they were just leaving.

327
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:17,041
Quite. If you think of anything else,
please do give us a call.

328
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,877
Ah. You know, the wine fridge
has actually been acting kind of funky.

329
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,382
Two refrigerators? Ha!
Give my regards to the Rockafellers.

330
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,508
[Charlotte sighs]

331
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,679
-[whistling]
-[grunting]

332
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,515
Can you keep it down, please?

333
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,310
I couldn't sleep
and you're like shout-whistling at me.

334
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,646
Hey, I'm just whistling. Chicago-style.

335
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,649
Don't. Just please be quiet.
I need to write.

336
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,943
Okay. Okay. Write on.

337
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,444
[exhales sharply]

338
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,280
-Hey, how was the writing?
-What do you mean?

339
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,907
You were gonna write today.

340
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,867
[Diane] Oh, is the day over?

341
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,789
-I was just thinking my thoughts...
-Are you all right?

342
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,707
-[crying]
-Oh! Oh, my God!

343
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,168
-Diane, what's wrong?
-I...

344
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,296
-[retching, coughing]
-Oh, oh, oh!

345
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,216
-It's okay. I got it in the plant.
-Oh! Not in the toilet?

346
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,218
I'm not gonna put my face in your toilet.

347
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,262
-Don't be gross.
-Our toilet, baby. We've been over this.

348
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,139
I had to think fast. Went for the plant.

349
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,727
Okay, but the sink? Or the shower?
There's so many drains in there.

350
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,145
I'm sorry. I gotta work.

351
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,774
Hey. [sighs] Maybe you can just go back
to bed and you can work in the morning.

352
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,985
No. Now. Gotta get it done.

353
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,069
[keyboard clacking]

354
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,322
I'm 17 years old. I live in Boston.

355
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,824
Krissy Keating's a real bitch to me.

356
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,077
{\an8}-Was I? Or did you deserve it?
-I deserved it.

357
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,538
Your problem is you always blame
other people, Deedee.

358
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,332
-I know.
-Who's a good baby? Not you!

359
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,834
Where are my pages, Diane?

360
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:46,422
I need pages for my beautiful celebrities,
such as Stockard Channing, Tatum O'Neal,

361
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,549
Patrick Harrison Ford Focus.

362
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,926
I'm trying to focus.
I'm trying to get to the truth.

363
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,928
-I think you're afraid of the truth.
-No.

364
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,514
{\an8}Your damage isn't interesting
and you're unworthy of love.

365
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,558
-No, I'm not!
-Of course you are!

366
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,934
Are you, uh, you know,

367
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,311
one of those stupid pop culture analogies
I'm always doing?

368
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:05,315
Because you're charming at first,
but eventually enough already!

369
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,026
{\an8}You think you're a beautiful salad bowl?

370
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,527
{\an8}[scoffs] Conceited much?

371
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,571
More like garden-variety, am I right?

372
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,073
[Diane's Dad] <i>You blame everyone else</i>
<i>for all your problems,</i>

373
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,242
<i>but you're the one constant here.</i>

374
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,119
{\an8}<i>-Go Pats.</i>
<i>-</i>You're right.

375
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,037
[breathing heavily]

376
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,539
Diane, what is going on?

377
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,584
There's a heaviness... on my chest.

378
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,545
And it's not just my boobs, even though,
yes, my boobs are heavier now.

379
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,464
-Hey. Talk to me.
-I stopped taking my meds.

380
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,758
-Why?
-Because I'm terrible!

381
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,719
I'm a stupid person! I deserve this!

382
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,138
No. You're not a stupid person,
but you can't just--

383
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,140
I want to die!

384
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,101
-It's so much worse than before.
-Baby, you're going through withdrawal.

385
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,563
Do I just have to be on drugs forever now?
How am I gonna finish my book?

386
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,441
-Okay, forget about the book for a second.
-I can't!

387
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,818
-It's the only thing that matters.
-Now, that's not true.

388
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,030
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm so stupid.
I'm sorry.

389
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,033
It's okay. It's okay.
Just take your pills. All right?

390
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,787
Then when you even out we can talk
about trying something else, okay?

391
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,538
Okay.

392
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,874
I just-just wanna be
a beautiful salad bowl.

393
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,376
You are a beautiful salad bowl.

394
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,384
-How're you doing?
-A little better today.

395
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,138
-And, uh, I wanted to say sorry.
-For what?

396
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,682
I don't know. "Being Diane"?

397
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,810
-Stop.
-I let the stress get to me.

398
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,562
I should just call Princess Carolyn
and tell her I need more time.

399
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,316
Yes. But before you do that...
don't be mad.

400
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,400
Don't be mad about what?

401
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,569
If I tell you, will you be mad?

402
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,905
From the tone of this conversation,
I'm guessing probably.

403
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,033
Okay, what you have to remember
is that you were in a really dark place.

404
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,035
And the pressure from Princess Carolyn
wasn't helping.

405
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,371
I thought if I could get her off your back
for a few days...

406
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,664
What did you do?

407
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,082
[phone buzzing]

408
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,459
Guy, what did you do?

409
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,755
I sent her the <i>Ivy Tran:</i>
<i>Food Court Detective</i> pages.

410
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,298
-What?
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Okay?

411
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,009
-I made an executive decision!
-You're not an executive!

412
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,011
I-I made a boyfriend decision! All right?

413
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,013
I made a "my girlfriend
is a depressed, vomiting mess

414
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,307
and someone needs to make a decision"
decision.

415
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,308
Ugh!

416
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,103
-Hello? No.
<i>-</i>[Princess Carolyn] <i>Loved it!</i>

417
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,647
I love the protagonist, I love the world,

418
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,817
I love that it wasn't your sad memoir
about your boring life.

419
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,735
What happened to "sad is the new fun"?

420
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,322
I didn't know you could write this fun!
You gotta finish this thing.

421
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,408
I'm on pins and needles,
and I'm not just saying that

422
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,034
-because I live with a porcupine.
-Listen--

423
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,454
To the ka-ching, ka-ching
of the middle-grade IP market? Done!

424
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,707
I slipped the pages to a few studios.

425
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,544
This has franchise potential.
Franch potench.

426
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,256
But what I'm saying is that it doesn't,
because that's not the book I'm writing.

427
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,258
-I'm hearing a maybe.
-I'm not--

428
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,509
[groans]

429
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,804
Are we gonna have
a Boston-style fight now?

430
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,810
[grunts]

431
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,563
[Ivy] <i>Here's a mystery.</i>

432
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,773
Why are you so sad-core?

433
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,110
{\an8}-I don't know.
-Just be fun and popular like me.

434
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,279
{\an8}-I don't know how.
-Sure, you do!

435
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,616
I'm clever and free-spirited
and a little bit sardonic

436
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,367
but not so much that it's off-putting.

437
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:07,456
I have vulnerabilities like everybody else
but just enough to make me relatable.

438
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,292
-That's the way to be.
-It's not that easy.

439
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,921
Yeah, I know.

440
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,799
But wouldn't it be nice if it was?

441
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,140
-[Ruthie cooing]
-Where's Princess Carolyn?

442
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,644
She said we should save her a seat.
You still working on that memoir?

443
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,854
Well, funny story about that--

444
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:35,984
Oh, I love when stories start like that!
Ooh! You should put this one in your book.

445
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,071
-Hello. Thank you.
-[cheering]

446
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,406
Oh, wow. Thank you.
That's very nice. Thank you.

447
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,743
Welcome to "An Evening
of Modern American Scenes."

448
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,495
Oh, excuse me.

449
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,455
-[sighs]
-We have to talk.

450
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,623
Shh. Diane!

451
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,541
-Don't be rude to the actors.
-[scoffs]

452
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,586
For most of them,
this'll be the height of their career.

453
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,882
[BoJack] Anyway, first up is a scene
from Sam German-Shepard's "Real America."

454
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,093
[audience cheering]

455
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,765
[Kyle laughing]
Char, hey, you gotta get in here!

456
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,559
This episode of "Birthday Dad"
is an all-timer!

457
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,521
-Penny...
-I wanted to get something.

458
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,317
[grunting]

459
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,529
[sighs] I don't feel good about
what happened with those reporters.

460
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,824
-It's okay.
-We didn't tell them... everything.

461
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,955
I tried to throw it out, but I couldn't.

462
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,916
I know that's messed up,
but I think I look nice here.

463
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,168
Oh! You look beautiful.

464
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,005
I don't think that's the only reason
I kept the photo, Mom.

465
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,548
It's all really confusing.

466
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,093
[Kyle] Charlotte! Birthday Dad
just got trapped in a leap year!

467
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,429
-How's he gonna wriggle outta this one?
-In a minute, honey!

468
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,849
Stuff happened to us, okay?
And he's still out there.

469
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,642
-Penny--
-If we can get the word out,

470
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,979
-if-if people knew--
-It won't be just him in the story.

471
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,440
It'll be you and me. The mistakes we made.

472
00:21:56,523 --> 00:22:00,944
Mistakes I made,
that I will never forgive myself for.

473
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,863
But if we can help other people,

474
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,032
then it will have been for something,
you know?

475
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,242
It won't just be this thing
to feel bad about forever.

476
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,536
You don't know what's gonna happen
with the story once it's out there.

477
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,704
You have no power over it.

478
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,498
And you just got your panic attacks
under control.

479
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,416
Yeah, I know, but--

480
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:19,504
I love that you want to do what's right,
but please just think about it, okay?

481
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,340
Just give it a couple days

482
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:25,177
and then if you still want to talk
to them, you can call them.

483
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,762
[sighs]

484
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,056
Okay. Thank you.

485
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,308
You wanna stay and watch "Birthday Dad"?

486
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,518
-Stay the night?
-No, I-I should go.

487
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,646
Okay. Yeah. I love you.

488
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,982
I love you, too.

489
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,028
[sighs]

490
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,620
[Kyle] Oh! Is that the International
Date Line?

491
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,082
Don't go over the date line, Birthday Dad!

492
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,335
Because then it won't be your birthday
anymore! [laughs]

493
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,254
[cheering]

494
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,382
Thank you. Thank you so much.

495
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,508
Come on, Todd, let's go.

496
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,386
But I wanna see
if there's an after-credits scene.

497
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,471
-[Princess Carolyn] Talk soon, Diane.
-Hey, wait a minute.

498
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,140
-[door opens, closes]
-Princess Carolyn. [grunts]

499
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,393
Princess Carolyn, wait.

500
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,104
I understand you're trying to be helpful,

501
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,731
-in your own pushy, self-absorbed way.
-Oh, thank you.

502
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,734
But I don't wanna write
a middle-grade fiction detective series.

503
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,236
I think you do, though.

504
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,115
Because when I was reading it,
I could tell you were having fun.

505
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,450
Yeah, but I'm not writing a book
to have fun.

506
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,994
If I don't write my book of essays now,
I never will!

507
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,746
So? Don't write your book of essays.

508
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,289
-I have to!
-Why?

509
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:40,794
Because if I don't,
that means that all the damage I got

510
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,880
isn't good damage, it's just damage.

511
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,715
I have gotten nothing out of it,

512
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,593
and all those years
I was miserable was for nothing.

513
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:52,514
I could have been happy this whole time
and written books about girl detectives

514
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,183
and been cheerful and popular
and had good parents,

515
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,727
is that what you're saying?
What was it all for?

516
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,645
I...

517
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,980
[sighs]

518
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,440
I don't know, Diane.

519
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:06,069
All I know is that this book
about the girl detective is fun.

520
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,195
I liked it.

521
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,655
I like thinking that my daughter

522
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,991
could grow up in a world
with books like that.

523
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,453
Or if my daughter's not a reader,
a lucrative film adaptation.

524
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,414
When I was a little girl,
I thought that everything,

525
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:22,043
all the abuse and neglect,
it somehow made me special,

526
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,296
and I decided that one day
I would write something

527
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,340
that would make little girls like me
feel less alone.

528
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,719
And if I can't write that book...

529
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,678
Then...

530
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,015
Then maybe write this other book.

531
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,311
-Maybe this book does that, too.
-Yeah?

532
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,149
-[Ruthie giggles]
-[toy squeaks]

533
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,111
-Uh... Princess Carolyn?
-What reporters?

534
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,029
BoJack?

535
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,948
Charlotte, I swear,
I don't know what you're talking about.

538
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,916
-Hey, man, great show.
-What? Huh?
