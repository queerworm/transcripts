[crying continues]

4
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,840
I need to get as far away
from Los Angeles as possible.

5
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,469
The handy ticketing screens are behind you
and will provide all the answers you need.

6
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,888
-Can't you just help me?
-Screen has all the answers.

7
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,641
[sighs] I could really use
some personal attention right now.

8
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,561
-Where did you want to go?
-I need to leave tonight. Anywhere.

9
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,064
Uh, okay. Hanoi?

10
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,941
Vietnam! Yes, perfect!
Thank you!

11
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,738
-Sh-should I punch it into that screen?
-Uh-huh.

12
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,824
And say nice things about me.
That screen's my supervisor.

{\an8}Hey, girl! Just checking up on that
clickable content you were working on.

17
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,062
Listen, something came up, and I--
Where are you?

18
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,566
{\an8}I'm doing a new, fully immersive,
3-D spin class.

19
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,443
[chuckles] Oh, you know what?
I'm just biking.

00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,196
-Oh. Well, I just landed in Vietnam...
-[growls]

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,074
{\an8}-Where is my content, Diane?
-Um...

22
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,451
I need words for my website.

23
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,121
There are words on the website now,
but I need younger words,

24
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,791
newer words, fresher words
to feed the insatiable beast!

25
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,043
Okay, okay, I'll write something
while I'm here.

<i>As a born and raised American,</i>

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,063
<i>you never felt much connection</i>
<i>to your Vietnamese heritage,</i>

32
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,233
<i>and your parents offered little</i>

{\an8}G'aw! You call that a fastball?

34
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:19,115
{\an8}With an arm like that, you're gonna get
booted back to Triple-A, you skeezer!

00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,035
{\an8}-Dad, where are we from?
-We're from Boston, dummy!

36
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,746
Why do you think I talk
in this accurate, regional dialect?

37
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,916
{\an8}I know that, but, I mean,
what is our background?

38
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,918
{\an8}Why do I look different
from the other kids?

39
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,212
{\an8}Ah, shove it up your rear, you jack-off.

40
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,798
{\an8}You're just the same as anybody else,
and don't let nobody tell you different.

41
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,384
I just thought you could give me
a little cultural context,

42
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,721
{\an8}what with you being a tenured professor
of Vietnamese history at Tufts and all.

43
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,598
{\an8}Christ, Deedee, that's my job.

44
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,184
{\an8}I wouldn't ask you to have a period
on your day off.

45

{\an8}What? Dad, it-- Okay.

46

[Diane] <i>But you're here, finally.</i>

47
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,567
<i>And it's comforting</i>
<i>to see your name everywhere</i>

48
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,819
{\an8}<i>and so many faces,</i>
<i>that look like your face.</i>

{\an8}-Ouch!

{\an8}<i>Because sometimes, to find yourself,</i>

63

Some American filmmakers are shooting
a movie, starring Laura Linney!

It's about a recently-divorced woman
who comes to Vietnam to find herself.

Are you okay?
You left my party without saying goodbye.

86
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,638
I was like,
"Uh-oh, what happened to Diane?"

87
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,890
-Well--
<i>-Then I got distracted</i>

88
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,100
because Todd got his tongue stuck
to the ice sculpture.

89
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,352
<i>By the time we got him off,</i>

90
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,355
his tongue was completely numb,
which made him talk real funny.

91
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,774
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, that got him in quite the situation

92
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,400
when the mob boss, at the roller rink,

93
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,527
thought he was making fun
of his deaf sister.

94
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,696
I'm sorry,
this is turning into a Todd story.

95
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,239
The point is, are you okay?

96
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,783
Oh, yeah, sorry.

97
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,036
[stammers] I just had a plane to catch,
so... I'm in Vietnam now...

<i>-Whoa.</i>
-...but... I'll be back soon.

99
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,749
-Let me fetch you from the airport.
-[bike bell rings]

100
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,044
Oh, that's okay.
You don't want to deal with the traffic.

101
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,712
You know I love traffic.

102
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,132
I get to catch up on all those hilarious
license plates I haven't read yet.

103
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,675
Okay. Thanks.

104
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,345
Great. Hey, I have to tell you...

105
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,972
I'm glad, I'm not still paying
your phone bill

106
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,308
because this call
must be costing a fortune!

107

<i>Unless you remembered to call Ed</i>
<i>for the international plan.</i>

108
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,438
Of course I remembered to do that!
But I have to hang up now.

109
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,857
Our conversation has reached
a natural conclusion, goodbye.

110
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,567
-[phone beeps]
-Ugh.

111
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,237
<i>Number three:</i>
<i>because you're single now</i>

112
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,072
<i>and you can do whatever you want.</i>

113
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,366
Isn't it great being single?

114
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,076
[chuckles] It sure is!

115
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,037
I love that we're mature enough
to still be in each other's lives.

116
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:53,955
I know!

117
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,749
Other divorced couples can't handle it,
but we're handling it, so well,

118
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,167
because we are better than them.

119
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,378
Are we the best divorced couple?

120
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,296
-I think we might be.
-Yeah.

121
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,175
How are you doing
with those divorce papers?

122
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,803
-It's been several weeks now-- Aah!
-Hi, folks! I'm Pickles.

123
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,721
-Ooh!
-Have you dined with us before?

124
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,931
-Yes.
-Well...

125
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,434
the way it works around here is:
you look at a menu,

126
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,353
pick what you want, I'll bring it to you,
and then you pay at the end.

127
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,813
So, like, a restaurant.

128
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,482
-Ooh, sounds great.
-Can I get you started with drinks?

129
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,483
Water would be great.

130
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,318
-Oh, my God, I love water.
-Me, too!

131
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,070
-Uh-huh.
-I'm 70 percent water!

132
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,114
-Okay.
-Me, too! What are the odds?

133
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,408
So, two waters. Thank you.

134
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,829
So... Mr. Peanutbutter,
the divorce papers.

135
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,248
-We need to-- Aah!
-It's me again, the same dog as before.

136
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,418
-Do you know what you'd like to order?
-Are you bringing our waters?

137
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,963
-No. I forgot. Food, though?
-Hmm, what do you like here?

138
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,257
-No, why would you ask--
-Oh, I like everything.

139
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,635
In fact, at the end of my shift,
I usually take everyone's leftover scraps

140
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,221
and put it in a trough and eat it up.
Miam, miam, miam, miam!

141
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,307
-But don't mention that to my boss.
-We won't.

142
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,809
But that does sound eclectic
and delectable.

143
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,186
The trough of everything.

144
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,564
-Okay, and--
-Whoa, somebody's not hungry at all.

145
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,609
-No, I am! I'm very hungry!
-[laughs]

146
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,069
[shouting] And I'll have the Cobb salad!

147
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,031
-Why do you keep humoring her?
-She's fun.

148
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,949
You know, if we were still married,

149
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,744
this would probably be enough
to spiral us off into a big argument,

150
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,663
that isn't even about the waitress,
and we would fight all night.

151
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,625
But since we're not married,
I can just be like, whatever.

152
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,711
-This is truly great.
-So... great.

153
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,963
We are doing so great.

154
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,423
Although...

155
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,802
I do get lonely sometimes
in that big house all by myself.

156
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,263
Hey, why don't you have
a housewarming party?

157
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,057
-Eh...
-Yeah!

158
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,809
Now that you don't have a mean wife
who hates parties...

159
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,228
He-he, you can finally live it up.

160
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,189
Okay, but only if you come.
Promise?

00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:19,106
[Diane] <i>But none of those reasons</i>
<i>are why you actually went to Vietnam.</i>

491
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,942
[plane taking off]

492
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,443
Hey, stranger.

493
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,654
-[joyful tune]
-[Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles]

494
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,073
Yeah, so, if it all looks good to you
and your lawyer,

495
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,575
you can sign it, too,
and then it'll be official.

496
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,203
-Divorce completed.
-Yay!

497
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,706
-We did it.
-Take that, our marriage!

498
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,919
-Well, I guess I'll see you around?
-Yeah.

499
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,505
-Oh! I was going for the--
-Oh, sorry. Did you--?

500
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,298
-[laughs]
-Sorry. Just go all the way.

501
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,842
-Well, bye.
-Cool.

502
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,430
Diane, wait.
I actually have something to tell you.

503
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,058
I... don't know the best way
to say this, but...

504
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,768
I'm seeing someone.

505
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,186
Romantically.

506
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,771
Who isn't you.

507
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,691
That was probably
not the best way to say it.

508
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,734
[dance music playing]

509
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,986
So, as I was saying,

510
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,238
being there for you right now
is my top pri--

511
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,407
-[phone vibrates, beeps]
-Oh. Hold on. Stuart!

512
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:15,704
There's a fire extinguisher under my desk.
Oh, that's what's on fire? In that case...

513
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,167
[Diane] <i>The real reason</i>
<i>you go to Vietnam</i>

514
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,211
<i>is because you accidentally see</i>
<i>your soon-to-be ex-husband</i>

515
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,588
<i>kiss someone else.</i>

516
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,672
[both chuckle]

517
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,801
<i>At first you think, "Oh, it's a fling.</i>
<i>Whatever, they're drunk, it's a party."</i>

518
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,303
[sad tune]

519
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,138
<i>But he puts his hand</i>
<i>on the small of her back</i>

520
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,765
<i>exactly the way he used to do to you.</i>

521
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,683
[both] Mmm.

522
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,728
<i>-It means "I've got you,"</i>
-[sad tunes continue]

523
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,814
<i>and when he did it to you,</i>
<i>it made you feel safe.</i>

524
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,693
<i>And you realize</i>
<i>he will never do that to you again.</i>

525
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,864
-[crying]
<i>-And it breaks your heart, again...</i>

526
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,825
<i>after your heart was so broken</i>
<i>that you thought</i>

527
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,077
<i>it could never get any more broken.</i>

528
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,038
<i>You thought it was safe,</i>

529
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,291
<i>but it still, somehow,</i>
<i>finds a new way to break.</i>

530
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,836
<i>Because, even though,</i>
<i>you're the one who asked for this,</i>

531
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,423
<i>now that you've got it,</i>
<i>you are completely adrift</i>

532
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:13,637
<i>with no compass, or map,</i>
<i>or sense of where to go, or what to do.</i>

533
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,097
<i>So you go to Vietnam.</i>

534
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,770
<i>You think you might find community,</i>
<i>a connection to something bigger,</i>

535
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,230
<i>but... you don't.</i>

536
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:27,692
<i>In fact, you feel even more alone</i>
<i>than you were before you left.</i>

537
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,570
<i>But... you survive.</i>

538
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,864
[sad tunes continue]

539
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,784
<i>You learn that you can survive</i>
<i>being alone.</i>

540
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,204
[sad tunes intense]

541
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,163
[sighs]

542
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,958
I'm really happy for you,
Mr. Peanutbutter.

543
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,751
[night crickets]

544
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,129
[singing in Vietnamese]
