00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,192
Clearly, muffins aren't supposed
to be in the produce section.

174
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,903
That wasn't a sign to you that
maybe someone else had dibs?

175
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,654
Look, I don't want to get
into a whole thing here.

176
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,865
Then give me the muffins.

177
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,952
No, 'cause maybe now
I want the muffins.

178
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,912
You think that because
you're a pseudo-celebrity,

179
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,455
normal rules don't
apply to you?

180
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,250
Pseudo? Would you say that
to Eric McCormack?

181
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,377
Look, I've had a rough morning,
so I don't need--

182
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,045
You've had a rough morning?

183
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,424
I spent
the last ten months--

184
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,259
Hey!

185
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,886
Sorry, wasn't listening.
See ya.

186
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,973
You're going to regret this,
BoJack Horseman.

187
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,266
[laughing]
Oh, really?

188
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,643
I'm gonna regret
buying muffins?

189
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,813
What, have they got a lot
of saturated fat in them?

190
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,898
Oh, man, they do have
a lot of saturated fat.

191
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,942
Why'd I buy these?

192
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,698
Man, I really regret
buying those muffins

193
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,034
and then eating them all
on the drive home.

194
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,786
Well, my date
with Ayako went really well.

195
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,870
Thanks for asking.

196
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,331
I specifically didn't ask,

197
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,915
and I'll thank you to respect

198
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,583
my total lack of interest
in your personal life.

199
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,960
She's hilarious.

200
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,962
I never met a girl
who was so curious

201
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,755
about American bank
routing numbers.

202
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,007
Still not interested.

203
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,383
Should we get started
on the book?

204
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,843
What's your hurry?

205
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,261
What do you guys think
I should get Ayako

206
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,263
for our 12-hour anniversary?

207
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,224
She wants a framed picture
of my mother's maiden name.

208
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,600
Okay, let's get to work.

209
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,023
Let's start
at the beginning.

210
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,025
What was your childhood like?

211
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,235
- Normal.
- Normal?

212
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,447
Yeah, it was, uh, normal--
normal childhood stuff.

213
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,615
Here's your omelet.

214
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,992
I'm sorry it's not as good

215
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,910
as the omelets
your secretary makes,

216
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,079
but then you're not married
to your secretary, are you?

217
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,208
Well, maybe if my secretary
also refused to get an abortion,

218
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,334
I would be.

219
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,294
Mommy,
can I have an omelet?

220
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,213
You're the birthday boy.

221
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,299
Normal childhood,

222
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,968
and then just get right
into the big, famous part.

223
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,761
Look, if you're not
ready to talk, we can wait.

224
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,389
I am ready to talk.

225
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,973
Why wouldn't I want
to talk about my parents?

226
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,308
They're so normal.
That's crazy.

227
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,143
You sound like
a crazy person, not me.

228
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,561
Stop being so crazy, crazy.

229
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,355
[laughing]
Why are you calling me crazy?

230
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,274
Okay. Was your father--
[upbeat ringtone]

231
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,901
Hold on, I got to take this.
Hello?

232
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,861
<i>Hey, BoJack, I've got</i>
<i>Princess Carolyn for you.</i>

233
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,488
<i>- It's urgent.</i>
- Great, put her on.

234
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,739
<i>Just a sec.</i>
<i>I'll see if she's available.</i>

235
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,533
<i>♪ When you're walking alone ♪</i>

236
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,659
<i>♪ Because Jellicles are</i>
<i>And-- ♪</i>

237
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,454
BoJack, are you
watching MSNBSea right now?

238
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,872
Great question.

239
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,290
Well, I didn't fall down
on my remote,

240
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,584
randomly changing the channel
to MSNBSea

241
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,878
while simultaneously
crippling myself,

242
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,507
thus physically forcing me
to watch MSNBSea, so no.

243
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,176
No, I'm not watching
MSNBSea right now.

244
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,011
Yeah, well, Hamlet,
you might want to turn it on.

245
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,137
They're talking about you.

246
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,805
Ooh!
Good things, I hope.

247
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,267
[sighs]

248
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,687
<i>Our guest via satellite</i>
<i>is Neal McBeal,</i>

249
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,232
<i>a naval officer on leave</i>
<i>from Afghanistan.</i>

250
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,483
<i>Welcome to the program, Neal.</i>

251
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,650
<i>Thank you, Tom.</i>

252
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,486
Hey, I met this guy.

253
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,780
<i>All Neal wanted</i>
<i>when he got home--</i>

254
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,200
<i>and I emphasize,</i>
<i>from Afghanistan--</i>

255
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,995
<i>was his favorite brand</i>
<i>of breakfast muffins.</i>

256
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,164
<i>When he went to the supermarket</i>
<i>and called dibs</i>

257
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,458
<i>on the last box--</i>

258
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,334
<i>Well, tell us</i>
<i>what happened, Neal.</i>

259
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:30,505
<i>BoJack Horseman, from</i>
<i>the '90s sitcom Horsin' Around,</i>

260
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,549
<i>refused to respect my dibs.</i>

261
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,093
<i>Have you no shame,</i>
<i>BoJack Horseman?</i>

262
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,095
<i>Seen here sneezing</i>
<i>at a Christmas party.</i>

263
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,679
<i>Oh, not the sneezing pic--</i>

264
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,432
<i>Why do they always use</i>
<i>the sneezing picture?</i>

265
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,601
<i>In the '90s,</i>
<i>we laughed at your antics.</i>

266
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,978
<i>Oh, how we laughed.</i>
<i>"Ha ha ha,"</i>

267
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,813
<i>we chortled</i>
<i>in rapturous glee.</i>

268
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,442
<i>But when you deny the dibs</i>
<i>called by our men and women</i>

269
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,735
<i>on the frontlines, that is</i>
<i>a sick joke, sir.</i>

270
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,405
<i>A sick, sick joke, indeed,</i>

271
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,740
<i>and you'll forgive me</i>
<i>if I chortle no longer,</i>

272
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,577
<i>for, to me, there is</i>
<i>nothing the least bit funny</i>

273
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,247
<i>about stealing a meal</i>
<i>from Neal McBeal, the Navy SEAL.</i>

274
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,790
<i>[grunting]</i>

275
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:09,043
Wait, wait, you stole muffins
from a Navy SEAL?

276
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,629
I didn't know
he was a Navy SEAL.

277
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,088
I just thought he was
the regular kind of seal.

278
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,174
<i>This is</i>
<i>classic Hollywood elitism.</i>

279
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,217
<i>BoJack Horseman thinks that</i>
<i>because he was on TV,</i>

280
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,927
<i>that makes him better</i>
<i>than everybody.</i>

281
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,555
<i>Well, guess what, BoJack,</i>
<i>now I'm on TV,</i>

282
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,307
<i>so now I'm better</i>
<i>than everybody!</i>

283
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,267
<i>That's right, Neal.</i>

284
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,853
You didn't even have dibs,
you stupid sea cow.

285
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,105
You guys think I should call in
and set the record straight?

286
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,690
BoJack, these people
feed off controversy.

287
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,860
If you dignify the story with a
response, it's just gonna fan--

288
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,487
<i>I'm now receiving word</i>

289
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,448
<i>that we've got BoJack himself</i>
<i>on the phone.</i>

290
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,824
Sorry, stopped listening.

291
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,409
You were ramping up
to a "yes," right?

292
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,077
<i>BoJack, what you did today</i>

293
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,246
<i>was a slap in the face</i>
<i>of America's heroes.</i>

294
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,707
<i>Will you apologize?</i>

295
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,044
Okay,
enough about America's heroes.

296
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,753
Can we talk about dibs?

297
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,839
Because he didn't
even really have dibs.

298
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,299
If he had legitimate dibs--

299
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,758
Oh, I had dibs
on the muffins.

300
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,136
I hid them
in the produce section!

301
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,680
You left them totally out
in the open.

302
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,181
That's hiding?

303
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,599
[yelling] How did you survive
in Afghanistan?

304
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,850
Those are my muffins!

305
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,810
You give me back my muffins!
[barks]

306
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,437
Hey, guess what,
I can't give them back

307
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,647
'cause I ate them all, okay?

308
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,273
Dude.

309
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,317
<i>Hold on, just to be clear,</i>
<i>since this morning,</i>

310
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,319
<i>you ate all the muffins?</i>

311
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,071
Yeah, I ate them all
in one sitting

312
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,448
because I have no self-control
and I hate myself.

313
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,325
Is that what you want to hear?

314
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,702
Neal, was it
a small container of muffins,

315
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,370
like two to four muffins?

316
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,248
No, Tom, there were
a good deal more than that.

317
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,291
Can you remember exactly how
many muffins were in the box?

318
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,252
Yeah, there were exactly 12!

319
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:36,047
I ate 12 muffins,
and I didn't even want one!

320
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,299
There's your goddamn news story,

321
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,928
the mystery of my missing
goddamn self-respect!

322
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,973
[pants]

323
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,766
How'd I come off?

324
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,521
Well, that went slightly
better than the worst

325
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:56,317
it could have possibly gone,
so hooray?

326
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,322
It's not even
about the muffins.

327
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,366
Everyone is just
out to get me

328
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,243
because I'm famous
and so well-adjusted.

329
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,994
Well, at least
you've got some privacy.

330
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,581
My boyfriend's filming
a reality show at our house.

331
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,583
If I want to be alone,
I have to go to the roof

332
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,543
because it's the only place they
don't have insurance to film.

333
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:14,793
You go on the roof?

334
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,795
Yeah,
just to get some work done.

335
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,131
Is that really weird?

336
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,882
No, it's adorable.

337
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,051
When I was a kid,
I used to climb onto the roof

338
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,095
with my dad
and look at the stars.

339
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,179
What about you?

340
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,056
Were you close with your father?

341
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,350
Happy Father's Day, Daddy.

342
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,102
What is this supposed to be,
a lima bean?

343
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,604
It's a heart.

344
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,315
That's some shoddy
craftsmanship, son.

345
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,400
- I tried my best.
- No, you didn't.

346
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,026
You slacked off
and took the easy way out.

347
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,445
In this world,
you can either

348
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,029
do things the easy way
or the right way.

349
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,448
You take a boat
from here to New York,

350
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,199
you gonna go around the horn
like a gentleman

351
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,952
or cut through the Panama Canal
like some kind of democrat?

352
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,496
Um, the canal?

353
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,207
You go around the horn
the way God intended!

354
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,292
Uneventful.

355
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,503
- What?
- What?

356
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,338
I asked if you were close
with your father,

357
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,381
and you sat here in silence
for five minutes

358
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,676
and then said, "Uneventful."

359
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,428
You know what, this is
a really good conversation,

360
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,013
and I definitely want
to keep having it,

361
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,056
but I just keep thinking
about the muffins thing,

362
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,100
so maybe we could put a pin
in this

363
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,560
thorough deconstruction
of my past,

364
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,812
so I can put that other thing

365
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,563

out of con--

00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,231
{\an8}<i>I had dibs!</i>

367
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,818
{\an8}<i>- My dibs were on those muffins!</i>
<i>- Your dibs were void!</i>

368
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,655
{\an8}<i>I spent a year in Afghanistan</i>
<i>making America safer,</i>

369
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,782
{\an8}<i>and this is the thanks I get?</i>

370
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,868
{\an8}<i>Really, you, specifically,</i>
<i>made America safer?</i>

371
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,538
{\an8}<i>Well, BoJack, surely,</i>
<i>even you would agree</i>

372
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,622
{\an8}<i>that the troops are heroes.</i>

373
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,457
{\an8}<i>I don't agree to that.</i>

374
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,168
{\an8}<i>Maybe some of the troops are</i>
<i>heroes but not automatically.</i>

375
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,795
{\an8}<i>I'm sure a lot</i>
<i>of the troops are jerks.</i>

376
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,588
{\an8}<i>Most people are</i>
<i>jerks already,</i>

377
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,590
{\an8}<i>and it's not like giving</i>
<i>a jerk a gun and telling him</i>

378
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,924
{\an8}<i>it's okay to kill people</i>

379
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,636
{\an8}<i>suddenly turns that jerk</i>
<i>into a hero.</i>

00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,597
What?

381
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:54,602
{\an8}<i>Did you just say you think</i>
<i>the troops are jerks?</i>

382
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,937
{\an8}<i>Oh, you took that the bad way,</i>
<i>didn't you?</i>

383
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,192
<i>I'm sure a lot</i>
<i>of the troops are jerks.</i>

384
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,402
No, no, no.

385
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,571
<i>- The troops are jerks?</i>
- Oh, God.

386
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,072

I don't hate the troops.

I just hate one specific troop.
I don't even hate him, really.

00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,022
I just think that
he's wrong about the muffins.

No,

He's willing to publicly forgive
you if you publicly apologize

00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,104

a box of muffins as a symbol

No, we should do it somewhere
people will actually see it.

Oh, why don't you do it
on <i>Peanutbutter and Jelly</i>?

492
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,177
You can't call a show

494

It's a pun.

00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,079
- Okay.
- Marker, sound, speed.

507
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,081
Well, here I am, hanging out

508
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,249
with my good friend
BoJack Horseman,

509
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,002
enjoying
each other's company,

510
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,378
as we often do.

511
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,339
Yes, this is all
very authentic and natural.

512
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,507
[doorbell rings]

513
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,550
Oh, someone's at the door!

514
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,719
I will see who it is.

515
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,307
Wow, this is a surprise.

516
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,642
Neal McBeal.

517
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,393
Hello, sir.

518
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,730
Thank you for inviting me
into your home. It is lovely.

519
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:54,485
BoJack, is there anything
you'd like to give Neal McBeal?

520
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,695
Ahem.

521
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,905
Oh, yeah, Todd?

522
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,157
What the hell is this?

523
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,616
I tried to buy the muffins,

524
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,036
but my bank card got declined
for some reason.

525
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,038
But don't worry,
I still saved the day

526
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,290
because I found this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

527
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,417
I'm sorry?

528
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,753
Yeah, they're just giving them
away behind In-N-Out.

529
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,048
Why does anybody
pay for anything?

530
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,549
Ow.

531
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,010
Uh, Neal, as a token
of my admiration,

532
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:24,015
please accept this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

533
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,475
- What?
- Yes, hamburger buns.

534
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,104
It's a symbol
for how we throw our veterans

535
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,773
in the trash, sadly,
far too often.

536
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,734
I'm listening.

537
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,569
We send
our muffins overseas,

538
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,030
and they come back
as stale hamburger buns,

539
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,991
but that doesn't mean
we should love them any less,

540
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,576
because in their own way,

541
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,580
aren't stale hamburger buns
just as good?

542
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,874
Mmm.

543
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,250
American made.

544
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,254
So what you're saying is,

545
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,673
you think I'm a hero.

546
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,966
Well, I don't know if I--

547
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,930
Say it, BoJack.
Say I'm a hero.

548
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,431
You're a hero.

549
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,018
The troops are all heroes,
every single one.

550
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,853
Great.

551
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,522
And I don't believe
saying that cheapens the word

552
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,900
and actually disrespects
those we mean to honor

553
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,112
by turning real people
into political pawns.

554
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,989
Okay, you can let go
of the bag now.

555
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,533
Also, I am not
deeply ambivalent

556
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,953
about a seemingly mandated
celebration of our military

557
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,996
by a nation
that claims to value peace

558
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,874
telling our children that
violence is never the answer

559
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,044
while refusing to hold our own
government to the same standard.

560
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,755
Yeah, me neither.
I think we're in agreement here.

561
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,883
Furthermore, I do not find
it unbelievably appropriate

562
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,928
that this conversation is taking
place on reality television,

563
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,512
a genre which thrives on

564
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,514
chopping the complexities
of our era

565
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:51,102
into easily digestible chunks
of empty catchphrases.

566
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,146
Okay.

567
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,981
And finally, I don't--

568
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,818
Hey, look, Mr. Peanutbutter
got a bucket stuck on his head.

569
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,946
Guys, guys, where am I?
Can someone tell me where I am?

570
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,198
Hey, where'd he get
that bucket from?

571
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,992
Who gave him a bucket?

572
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,368
[laughter]

573
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,164
Uh, actually, I had
another point I wanted to make.

574
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,333
Yeah, but who doesn't love
a dog with a bucket on his head?

575
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,542
Come on.

576
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,336
Bucket! Bucket!

577
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,671
[crowd] Bucket!

578
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:22,758
Bucket! Bucket!
Bucket! Bucket!

579
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,136
Hey, can anyone
find a handle?

580
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,096
[howls]
[all cheer]

581
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,765
Oh, thank you, my friend.

582
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,600
You're a real hero.

583
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,977
Unbelievable.

584
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,352
What's your name, young lady?

585
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,230
Well, my real name's Angela,

586
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,815
but my friends call me Jelly.

587
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,776
What?
Oh, my God, did we get that?

588
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,361
Please tell me we got that.

589
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,786
[chuffs]

590
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,288
You want
a day-old hamburger bun?

591
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,498
I'm all right.
How'd it go down there?

592
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,917
You know what the problem is
with everybody?

593
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,586
They all just want to hear
what they already believe.

594
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,547
No one ever wants
to hear the truth.

595
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,049
I want to hear the truth.

596
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,633
I don't know if you want
to tell it, though.

597
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,177
What do you mean?

598
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,014
Mr. Normal Childhood,
Mr. Uneventful Father?

599
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,598
Look, I can write you
the standard

600
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,684
empty-calorie celebrity
tell-some,

601
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,186
if that's what
you're looking for,

602
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,312
but I thought you
might want more than that.

603
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,938
I do.

604
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,565
Well, then you're going
to have to open up

605
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,150
and give me something real.

606
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,693
What, you think
I can't open up?

607
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,861
Well, I don't know
if you can or not.

608
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,487
You certainly haven't.

609
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,156
[sighs]

610
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,660
Okay, from now on,
full truth, warts and all.

611
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,330
You're not gonna make me look
like an asshole, are you?

612
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,498
I don't know,
are you an asshole?

613
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:41,254
Okay, full truth,
here we go.

614
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,922
You want to know
about my parents?

615
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,007
They drank a lot.

616
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,842
My father was
a failed novelist.

617
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,887
My mother was the heiress to the
Sugarman sugar cubes fortune,

618
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,347
and my dad
resented her for it.

619
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,015
He used to make me cry
with him

620
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,808
while listening
to Cole Porter records.

621
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,769
He made me build
my own tree house,

622
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,604
and then he tore it down
while I was at summer camp

623
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,522
because instead of
hearty, Christian nails,

624
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:04,818
I used screws,
which he called fancy Jew nails.

625
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,905
