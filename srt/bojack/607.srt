00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>I'm not doing drugs. I'm not like you.</i>
<i>I don't fetishize my own sadness.</i>

00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,119
<i>No, my hands are so slippery.</i>

00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,789
<i>Damn it, Todd. Clean up your shit.</i>
<i>You know I had sex with Emily.</i>

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,171
<i>Turns out there's a brand of heroin</i>

<i>Please don't make me go back to LA.</i>
<i>You can count on me, Herb.</i>

[BoJack] <i>Yes, you are the last person</i>

Sharona?

{\an8}[Sharona] Ow! You're hurting me.
Let me go! [grunting]

18
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,598
{\an8}Sarah Lynn got into vodka.

19
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,185
{\an8}-Oh, my God, is she okay?
-Danny knows she got it from you.

20
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,979
{\an8}-It was yours.
-Mine, yours.

21
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,439
{\an8}What difference does it make
who brought this particular vodka?

22
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,817
{\an8}If I take the fall for this,
this whole show is over.

23
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,862
And that means everything I did
was for nothing.

24
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,613
-What you did?
-To Herb, I mean.

25
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,657
What I did to save the show,
do you understand?

26
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,327
-All that's pointless if it goes away now.
-So, what am I supposed to do?

27
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,329
I have friends on <i>Coach</i>
who owe me a favor.

28
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,916
-It could be a fresh start for you.
-There's no such thing as a fresh start.

It's an easy job.

Nobody is asking you, Sharona.

32
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,470
BoJack Horseman,
would you like to share? I...

33
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,431
{\an8}[stammers] I'm sorry.
I don't know who you are.

34

{\an8}This is anonymous.
BoJack Horseman? Who's that?

36
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,230
{\an8}Um, yeah. Um...

37
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,525
I'm BoJack and, uh...

38
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,736
God, this feels so dumb.

39
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,530
{\an8}And I'm an alcoholic.

40
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,032
{\an8}[all] Hi, BoJack!

41
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,704
Look, I can't go to the Galapagos.

42
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,040
{\an8}Guy, you have to.
This is an important job.

43
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,335
{\an8}[laughs] It's the National Geographic
Swimsuit Edition.

44
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,171
They want me shooting behind-the-scenes
video of turtles in bikinis.

45
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,173
Seems unimportant in light
of what you've been dealing with.

46
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,674
{\an8}What I'm dealing with?

47
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,635
{\an8}Your psychiatrist said you're depressed.

48
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,138
Okay, yeah, I've been a little depressed.
But I'm not like <i>depressed.</i>

49
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,806
I don't have depression.

50
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,350
{\an8}You're smoking three packs a day,

51
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,435
{\an8}you've been wearing the same
pajama bottoms for weeks...

52
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,270
{\an8}This is all part of my writing process.

53
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,897
{\an8}My best stuff comes out
when I hate myself.

54
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,358
{\an8}[chuckles]
What stuff? No stuff is coming out.

55
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,567
[scoffs]

56
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,656
{\an8}I'd feel better if you just tried
the medication your doctor prescribed.

57
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,907
{\an8}Well, I'd feel worse.

58
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,035
{\an8}They put me on Prozac in college
and I was so calm and boring,

59
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,370
{\an8}I didn't even wanna LiveJournal.

60
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,790
{\an8}And then <i>Dawson's Creek </i>got bad because
there was no one to speak truth to power.

61
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,084
<i>Dawson's Creek</i> did not get bad.

62
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,212
You just started taking antidepressants,
which you should also do now.

63
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,839
It sucks. It made me break out.
I gained weight.

64
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,885
What if you leave and come back
to this person you don't even recognize?

65
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,762
I don't even recognize you now.

66
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,641
You're making this a bigger thing
than it is. I'll be fine.

67
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,727
Don't fall for one of those models.

68
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,479
I'm a one-woman man.

69
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,648
If that woman happens
to be a turtle in a two-piece,

70
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,566
-that's just destiny.

76
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,041
These strike negotiations
have lasted so long,

77
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,793
it's like <i>Reds</i> in this boardroom.

78
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,837
Remember <i>Reds?</i> Two VHS tapes.

79
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,673
That's too many tapes, I said,
but no one listens to Lenny.

80
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,216
How's this look?

81
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,510
Generous, but you're making up
the projected loss

82
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,722
by excising office birthday cakes.
That's unacceptable.

83
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,557
Everybody hates office parties.

84
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,851
Everyone hates the mysterious
dried fruit cubes in trail mix

85
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,145
but we still eat them after the other nuts
and seeds are gone

86
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,689
because in our undervalued,
overworked existence,

87
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,733
we're desperate
for any morsel of satisfaction,

88
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,360
whether that be cake,
unidentifiable orange fruit shards

89
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,279
or the occasional kind word from our boss.

90
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,698
I like cake.
They can print those pictures on them now.

91
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,741
What's the issue here?

92
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,286
Fine. But we're grouping birthdays
so they only happen once a month.

93
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,997
We accept those terms.
We're left with one final issue.

94
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,250
Your insistence assistants
be not treated like garbage?

95
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,671
From this day forth, all assistants
will be treated like recycling.

96
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,131
Right next to the garbage,

97
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:44,844
but with an understanding that one day,
they may be up-cycled to a higher status.

98
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,472
Like a bunch of seatbelts
that got turned into a purse.

99
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,099
Or a license plate that gets turned
into a purse. Right, Lenny?

100
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,018
Sure, sure. I'm green.

101
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,437
-We're amenable to these terms.
-Oh.

102
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,736
-Judah. I meant to reach out--
-There's no need to explain,

103
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,571
I know you're very busy
with work and Ruthie.

104
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,239
[chuckles] You have no idea.

105
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,407
I have some idea.

106
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,743
You talked about it quite often
during the negotiations.

107
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:12,372
This strike has been the most time I've
been able to spend with Ruthie since...

108
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,248
-[coos]
-...ever.

109
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,376
I also feel an ambivalence
about the strike ending.

110
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,503
The negotiations have been
quite invigorating.

111
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,838
And now you're just gonna ride off
into the sunset?

112
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,049
No, the sun sets in the west.

113
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,427
I'm riding east to my Atwater cottage.
[grunts] Goodbye.

114
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,887
-Judah!
-Yes?

115
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,264
You're the best assistant I ever had.

116
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,351
You don't need <i>ever</i> in that sentence.
It's implied.

117
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,435

Mm.

Thank you for meeting me here.
I can't be at my house.

124
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,831
Just reminds me
of what an asshole I've been.

125
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,042
Makes sense. Your house reminds me
of what an asshole you've been, too.

126
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,794
-[camera shutter clicking]
-Uh... what are you doing?

127
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,089
I'm updating my asexual dating profile
with some fresh pics.

128
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,051
There's still no one else on the app,
but when they join, I wanna be ready.

129
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,972
Look at this busted photo.
It's from over a year ago.

130
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,308
Yeah, you gotta stay current.

131
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,770
Oh, man, they always ask for your job.
Oh, I actually have a job!

132
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,230
Hype man for babies.

133
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,065
You've really taken to this
nanny thing, huh?

134
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,902
I love it. It's so amazing
to hold a baby and look at it sleep

135
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,613
and think, "This is a perfect thing."

136
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,616
-I can't imagine.
-It's weird to think that at one point,

137
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,202
someone held me in their hands
and thought,

138
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,206
"I'm going to love this kid forever,"
you know? What happened?

139
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,291
What happened to what?

140
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,501
I don't know. Moms are weird, right?

141
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,129
Um... Yeah, moms are weird.

142
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:47,049
So, what are you gonna do now?
Just keep getting lunch with your friends?

143
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,593
There was a stewardess in the meeting.

144
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,096
She was talking about how every day,
she wakes up in a different place.

145
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,265
I thought, "That sounds perfect."

146
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,225
Every city a clean slate?

147
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,226
Stewardess?

148
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,022
I think the preferred term
is flight servant.

149
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,107
[soft music playing]

150
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,915
To us! And depression!

151
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,585
[chuckles] Yes, but before I drink to that
and then depart with you

152
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,587
on a cross-country tour
of speaking engagements

153
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,422
as the quote-unquote "Face of Depression,"

154
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,133
there is something I feel
I must get off my chest.

155
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,261
As it says on the cover of my last single
"You Can Tell Me Anything,"

156
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,471
you can tell me anything.

157
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,974
-I am not depressed.
-[gasps]

158
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,559
Wait. How can you know that?

159
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,853
Well, I feel very happy.

160
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,104
Oh, I know.

161
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,440
[sighs] Just as I suspected, half-full!

162
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,609
Hmm. That is a troubling development.

163
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,027
And right before our tour!

164
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,197
I would be quite upset by this
if I were at all prone to depression,

165
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,533
which, as we've just established,
I am not.

166
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,619
But isn't it possible that
you are depressed and just don't know it?

167
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,205
Well, I do frequently not know things.

168
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,291
According to the literature for this tour
that I did not read

169
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,502
but had my mom peruse
and then paraphrase for me,

170
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,130
people who seem happy can actually
be the most depressed.

171
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,882
Oh, no! I seem very happy!

172
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,343
-I know.
-But wait! You seem happy, too!

173
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,387
Oh, no, does that mean I'm also depressed?

174
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,515
-Oh, good thing we're going on this tour.
-We gotta get the word out.

175
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,019
-A cinnabunny and a coffee, please.
-3.25.

176
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,147
Four and five.

177
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,483
As Gandhi says, "Make the change you wish
to see in the world."

178
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,820
Goodbye, change. Good luck out there.
I'll miss you.

179
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,446
-Uh, what?
-It's for the best. Go.

180
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,032
Just go, please.
Don't make it harder than it has to be.

181
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,117
Okay.

182
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,668
[birds chirping]

183
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,879
[thunder rumbling]

184
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,257
-What is depression?
-Depression.

185
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,177
-Who is depression?
-You or someone you love.

186
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:59,140
-Where is depression?
-A grassy field, perhaps.

187
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:04,103
If any of these words describe you
or your feelings, you may suffer from...

188
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,563
{\an8}<i>-Depression.</i>
<i>-...depression.</i>

189
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,483
[doorbell rings]

190
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,653
-BoJack?
-Surprise!

191
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,158
-Uh, is this a bad time or...?
-No.

192
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,868
It's just...

193
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,120
Heat's broken. Let's go for a walk.

194
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,792
-Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
-I didn't know.

195
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,463
I was in LA and I didn't want to be, so...

196
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,715
-I'm glad you're here.
-You doing okay?

197
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,676
I'm doing great.
I have this wonderful boyfriend.

198
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,970
I got an advance
on a book of personal essays.

199
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,639
Me, personal essays.

200
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,557
I mean, who am I? Sloane Crosley?

201
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,185
-Who's Sloane Crosley?
-Good point. Who's Sloane Crosley?

202
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,187
Yeah, who is Sloane Crosley?

203
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,229
Exactly.

204
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,316
But the headline is you're doing great?

205
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,442
So great.

206
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,110
[slurps]

207
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,739
-Can I crash at your apartment?
-No!

208
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,787
-I think I'm depressed.
-Yeah?

209
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,331
It started when I was having trouble
with my book,

210
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,707
and then it kind of snowballed

211
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,544
into my boyfriend saying
I should take antidepressants.

212
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,672
-Are you going to?
-What's the point?

213
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,758
Of antidepressants? I believe the point
is to be antidepressed.

214
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:21,972
Sure. Or you just flip over the nothing
and underneath there's more nothing.

215
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:26,519
Then you flip over that nothing
and there's more nothing underneath that.

216
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,730
So, you just keep flipping over nothings,
all your life,

217
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,400
because you keep thinking
under all that nothing,

218
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:36,153
there's gotta be something,
but all you find is nothing.

219
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,616
Sure, but you flip over this pizza box,
uh, and look, a couch!

220
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,909
We're gonna break up soon anyway.

221
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,161
There's only so long before he gets tired
of the real me.

222
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,705
The real you being...?

223
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,914
Ta-da!

224
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,501
You know, someone got really mad
at me recently...

225
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,128
Mad? At you?

226
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,087
I know, shocking.

227
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,464
And he said, "BoJack, you ruin everything.

228
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,633
-That's what you are."
-Oof.

229
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,468
And it actually took him saying it
out loud

230
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,389
for me to realize how stupid that is,

231
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,599
even though I believed it for so long.

232
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,019
I bought into this idea that I was a thing
that couldn't be changed.

233
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,356
So, the reason I came to Chicago is...

234
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,024
I wanted to thank you

235
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,902
for believing in me when I didn't,

236
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,822
and for encouraging me
to accept the help I needed.

237
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,990
Hmm.

238
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,450

240
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,625

242
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,686
Hmm.

-[groans] Mm?
-[yelps]

244
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:01,113
So, I'm really glad you're here,
but a little notice next time?

245
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,448
Oh, yeah, sorry.

246
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,325
I already made plans with Tawnie.

247
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,701
-Hey.
-[screams]

248
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,162
Hi, Tawnie. Why are you in the backseat?

249
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,999
Hollyhock and I are in a fight right now.
It's both minute and massive.

250
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,251
How can it be minute and massive?

251
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,921
It's a paradox.
It's Sylvia Plath wearing Saint Laurent.

252
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,422
[groans] Wesleyan.

253
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,385
Anyway, we're going to a show.
You're welcome to join us.

254
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,513
Great. A music show? I love music.

255
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:30,309
[discordant sounds playing]

256
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,728
Oh, God, is this what music sounds like
when you're sober?

257
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,855
-Do I hate music?
-No, this sucks.

258
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,316
I'm just here because
I wanted to cheer up Tawnie.

259
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,567
I thought you were in a fight.

260
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,778
Yeah, but I still don't want her
to feel bad.

261
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,989
She's my best friend.
They cancelled all the drama classes.

262
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,074
What? Why?

263
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,994
The acting professor quit.
He got cast in a regional commercial.

264
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,871
And he quit? Wow.

265
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,457
So, yeah, now Tawnie's gotta
change her major,

266
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,084
which I get why that sucks,

267
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,044
but don't take it out on me.

268
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,673
I'll bet a lot of actors would love
to teach at a place like this.

269
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,258
They're not looking for a replacement?

270
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,053
Maybe they are. I don't know.
What do I look like, the Wesleyan Argus?

271
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,681
Okay, I don't wanna be fighting anymore,
so can we just drop it?

272
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,976
-You always do this.
-I'm trying to move past it.

273
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,186
You said we were gonna meet
at Pi Café for dinner.

274
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,354
-I forgot.
-Yeah.

275
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,108
That hurt my feelings.
Now we're just supposed to move past it?

276
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,901
Ah, I see. A teachable moment.

277
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,028
Hollyhock, people will disappoint you.

278
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,489
You're always mad at me.
There's nothing I can say.

279
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,366
Yes, some wounds will never be healed.

280
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,909
You could say sorry.

281
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,412
-Would it even matter?
-No, words are meaningless.

282
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:35,583
Yes. You do this thing where
you don't think you can ever be forgiven,

283
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,126
so you don't apologize,

284
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,920
but I can't forgive you
if you don't say you're sorry.

285
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,172
Okay, I'm... sorry.

286
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,216
Thank you. That's all I wanted.

287
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,968
-I'm sorry.
-I love you.

288
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,261
I love you, too.

289
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,971
Come here. Mm!

290
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:49,889
That's it?

291
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,932
-Come on, let's dance. [chuckles]
-Yeah!

292
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,602
-Uh... [groans]
-[Hollyhock] BoJack!

293
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,395
I'm really glad you came to visit.

294
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,439
-Where are you going next?
-I don't know.

295
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,774
-Where is not winter?
-California?

296
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,735
No, I can't go back there. Not yet.

297
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,028
-Florida?
-[groans]

298
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,530
-Arizona?
-Some parts of Texas?

299
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,573
[groans]

300
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,288
I'm telling you, people come
to the airport just to eat these things.

301
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,582
But if their houses were made
of cinnamon and dough,

302
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,083
they wouldn't have to go anywhere!

303
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,795
They could eat and live happily
in their Cinnabungalow.

304
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,132
Well, I think it's a great idea
and this customer thinks so, too.

305
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,967
-Right, Lonely Horse Guy?
-Sure.

306
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,721
He loves it! You better get in on this
before there's a bidding war.

307
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:34,224
[sighs] No, I'm not dating anyone.
Stay on topic, Mom.

308
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,355
And Amelia Earhart flew through the skies

309
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:44,360
until one day, she made it to the sun
and everybody cheered. The end.

310
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,277
[knocking on door]

311
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,905
-[Princess Carolyn] Oh.
-Hey.

312
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,493
I'm out of rehab and I realized I never
got you a baby shower gift, so... here.

313
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:56,205
I'm registered at Cubs 'R' Us
and Baby Hole, but thanks.

314
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,790
If I'm gonna live in that house again,

315
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,292
I wanna get rid of the things
that remind me of my old life.

316
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,420
Look what Uncle BoJack
brought you, Ruthie.

317
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,466
It's a 1970s pop art interpretation
of the Narcissus myth.

318
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,134
How appropriate for a baby.

319
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,011
Narcissus?
I thought the painting was about me.

320
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,722
But enough about your baby,
I also have a favor to ask.

321
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,057
Of course you do.

322
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,851
There's this drama professor job
at Wesleyan.

323
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,605
They need a reference to tell them
that I know what I'm talking about,

324
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,482
that I'm dependable and passionate.

325
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,360
So, I thought that you could do
what you've been doing for 20 years

326
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,569
and lie about me.

327
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,279
I'll be back at the office tomorrow.

328
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,241
But have them call my cell
because my assistant is terrible.

329
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,283
[cooing]

330
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,578
-Oh, shit, it walks already?
-She started a few days ago.

331
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,664

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,126
My fellow horses, are we doomed to die
in the shadow of our sins?

500
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,043
[all] Nay!

501
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,754
Does thy Lord turn His back on His colts?

502
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,923
-Nay!
-Nay.

503
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,259
Nay, for to forgive is divine.

504
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,596
Unless thou art a witch,
then God wills ye be burnt at the stake.

-[clears throat]
-There, Goody Oats! Seize her!

506
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,185
No, no, no! [screaming]

507
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,102
[door slams]

508
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,522
If God forgives thee,
thou must also forgive thyself.

509
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:46,485
"Though thy sins be like scarlet,
they shall be white as snow."

510
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,654
It is only when we show ourselves
forgiveness and mercy

511
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,450
that we truly live a life of grace,
that we are reborn.

512
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:57,037
Turn to the horse next to you
and offer a sign of grace and peace

513
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,580
in the name of the Lord.

514
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,624
[man] Peace be with you.

515
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,376
-Peace be with you.
-Uh, peace be with you.

516
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,711
-Peace be with you.
-Peace be with you.

517
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,713
Peace be with you. Peace be with you.

518
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,757
Peace be with you. Peace be with you.

519
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,467
-[man] And also with you.
-Peace be with you.

520
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,846
And that concludes our reenactment
of an early Horsey service! Thank you.
