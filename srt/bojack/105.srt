00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,849
My family made
my life miserable,

174
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,351
and then they never
forgave me for leaving.

175
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,019
So, what,
you're like the black sheep?

176
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,854
No, Gary's the black sheep.
He's adopted.

177
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,647
I'm just the member of
the family nobody likes.

178
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,524
And my dad
was the worst of them all.

179
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,193
You told me
that you and your father

180
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,278
used to sit on the roof
and look at the stars together.

181
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,947
Oh, yeah, I was just trying
to get you to open up,

182
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,950
so I used an old writer's trick
called "me lying to you."

183
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,119
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm using an old me trick

184
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,662
called
"that hurts my feelings."

185
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,248
And the truth is,
I used to sit alone

186
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,707
on the hill out by the dump

187
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,959
and dream of waking up
as Chelsea Clinton,

188
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,211
but with my hair.

189
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,419
You do have great hair.

190
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,130
I know.

191
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,716
[distant sirens]

192
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,093
That's us.

193
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,426
I'll just pop in
for a quick hi and bye.

194
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,553
Then we'll be on our way.

195
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,305
Ten minutes, swear to God.

196
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,514
You can play
with this kaleidoscope

197
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,766
I got you at the airport.

198
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,768
What?
A kaleidoscope?

199
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,561
I'm not five--

200
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,022
Shapes and colors the likes
of which I've never seen.

201
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,899
Hello.

202
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,735
[in Boston accent]
Hey, yeah, Deedee came home!

203
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,612
Gary, Marty, Artie,
Deedee's back!

204
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,738
Come here!

205
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,448
[Boston accent] Game.
Watching the game.

206
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,824
Can't look up from the game.
How you doing?

207
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,201
Marty, it's a game from '86.

208
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,911
You've seen it
a hundred times.

209
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,746
And how many times does
Buckner break your heart?

210
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,290
[both] 100 times.

211
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,208
[Boston accent] Aw, thank God
you're here, Deedee.

212
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,751
Pops is wicked departed.

213
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,753
Oh, yeah, man.
He departed so hard.

214
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,964
And I do not like
them apples, Deedee.

215
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,299
Yo, Deedee, get me a beer.

216
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,591
[Boston accent] Yeah,
make that two, Deedee.

217
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,718
Gary, Marty,
I just got home.

218
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:53,390
Ooh, Princess Diane doesn't
want to get her brother a beer.

219
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,892
Hey, Ma, come look
what the Pats dragged in.

220
00:07:55,976 --> 00:08:00,688
[Boston accent] Oh, hello!
Look who decided to come home.

221
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,566
Queen Deedee blesses us
with her presence.

222
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,568
To what do I owe the honor?

223
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,446
Look, I'm just here
to offer my condolences.

224
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,450
Oh, sure, in and out,
like a Protestant on Christmas.

225
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,909
Why would you want
to stick around,

226
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,328
be with your family
in their time of need?

227
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,870
Come on, Ma.

228
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,122
Don't fight
while the game's on.

229
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,332
It's bad Juju.

230
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,167
It's the '86 World Series.

232
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,752
Ah, why'd you have to--

233
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,879
Oh, we're just a bunch
of savages, right?

234
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,382
We're not like your fancy
California friends.

Oh, come off it, Ma.
She don't mean no harm.

237
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,640
For five years
she didn't come home.

238
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,393
Why don't you make like A-Rod
and blow.

239
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,062
Well, this was clearly
a huge mistake.

240
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,439
Ah, don't go.

241
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,982
Deedee, please.

242
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,650
Why not?
Ma doesn't want me here.

243
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,610
Ma don't know
what she wants.

244
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,363
She wants you here.
We all do.

245
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,530
Ain't that right, Marty?

246
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,781
Can't look up from the game.

247
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,033
Besides, we need your help

248

the funeral stuff.

249
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,660

00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,413
Fine, I'll help.

Oh, my God.
Is that dad?

257
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,676
Did someone draw balls
on his forehead?

258
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,470
That was before
we knew he was dead.

259
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,430
We just thought
he was wicked hung over.

00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,153
He was graping it up
with the Daredevil himself.

345
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,573
This is the greatest day
of my life.

346
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,366
Oh!

347
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,410
Hey, I don't suppose you boys
would have any interest

348
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,370
in maybe playing some
touch football later?

349
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,745
Are you kidding?

350
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,164
Touch football
with a star like you?

351
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,208
That would be
mad wicked pisser.

352
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,750
Ooh, you know what else
we got to do?

353
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,713
We got to watch
the Cryane video.

354
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,339
Ooh, that sounds good.
What's that?

355
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,840
No, we don't need
to revisit that.

356
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,467
When Deedee was 16,

357
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,220
we made up a secret pen pal
for her named Leo.

358
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,599
Guys, I really would rather
not discuss it.

359
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,517
We all took turns
writing her letters,

360
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,769
pretending to be this sensitive
boy from Cambridge.

361
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,522
It was wicked messed up.

362
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,900
"Oh, Diane, we're
two misunderstood souls.

363
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,736
Everyone else is a phony.

364
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,280
Yours forever, Leo."

365
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,823
What?
That is amazing.

366
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,367
After six months of letters,

367
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,869
we hired a homeless guy
to pretend to be Leo

368
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,414
and take her
to the homecoming dance.

369
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,831
- Look at her.
- Watch, watch this part.

370
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,751
I like your boutonnière.
[laughter]

371
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,586
[cries]

372
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,422
Why don't we watch this
every day?

373
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,797
- Look at her face.
- Now that's a good prank.

374
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,174
I was humiliated.

375
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,635
Yeah, you wouldn't get it.

376
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,470
It's a brothers thing,
right, brothers?

377
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,346
Whoo!
That's Cryane for you.

378
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,889
What a pussy.

379
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,475
You know,
it's nice that years later

380
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,143
we can all laugh about this.

381
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,061
Yep, my therapist
thinks the same thing.

382
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,021
I'm gonna go meet
with the funeral director.

383
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,690
Any of you boys
want to come?

384
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,609
Nah, I ain't so big
on funeral homes, Deedee.

385
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,235
All them dead bodies,
they give me the jeebies.

386
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,780
Yeah, Deedee,
why do we got to go?

387
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,698
Fine, none of you
have to go.

388
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,283
I'll take care of everything.

389
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,118
Thank you, Diane.
We all really appreciate it.

390
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,453
Come on, BoJack.

391
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,912
Why you got to take
BoJack with you?

392
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,247
- Boo!
- [bleats]

393
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,415
Boo!

394
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,750
Boys, you have
stolen my heart

395
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,502
like Dave Roberts
stole second base.

396
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,712
[laughs] Hey!
He knows our things!

397
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,256
I must go now, but I'll see
you all at the funeral, okay?

398
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,801
And when I do,
you're all getting noogies.

399
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,884
- Funeral!
- Yeah!

400
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:04,969
Whoo-hoo!

401
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,179
[all] Funeral!

402
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,472
Funeral! Funeral!

403
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,807
Ugh.

404
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,017
And now,
a very special treat

405
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,269
just for
our platinum members.

406
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,480
Let's take a peek
at the slumbering

407
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,275
Mr. Boreanaz himself.

408
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,277
<i>Get out of my room, Todd!</i>

409
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,945
<i>I'm David Boreanaz.</i>

410
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,572
[all] Ohh!

411
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,115
And thus concludes our tour.

412
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,950
Have a Boreanderful day.

413
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,952
[somber organ music]

414
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,288
Tell me about your father.

415
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,333
Well, he was a mean,
sadistic alcoholic,

416
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,251
who never supported
anything I did

417
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,253
and actively delighted
in seeing me fail.

418
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,214
Hmm, I see.

419
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,884
Sounds like you're looking for
our Piece of Shit Dad Package.

420
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,803
That would be too good
for my father.

421
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,555
Hmm, I see.

422
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,850
Might I then suggest
our Piece of Shit Dad Package

423
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,185
Would Be Too Good
For Him Package.

424
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,812
Yeah, that's the one.

425
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,022
Excellent choice.

426
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,066
Hey, can I suggest
something?

427
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,318
You might want to loosen up
a little.

428
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,153
I think you could actually
learn a thing or two

429
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,238
from your brothers.

430
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,947
Are you kidding?

431
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,075
If I was like my brothers,
nothing would ever get done.

432
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,660
I'm just saying,

433
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,871
if you can't find a way
to let off some steam

434
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,081
you're going to explode.
[phone rings]

435
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,916
God damn it!
Are you god damn kidding me?

436
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,501
I keep getting calls
from this unlisted number.

437
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,420
Ignore.
Who are these assholes?

438
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,129
Why don't you just answer,
and then you'll know?

439
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,840
Oh, they'd just love that,
wouldn't they?

440
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,884
Ugh, how are we supposed
to blackmail him

441
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,301
if we can't reach him?

442
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,763
Maybe we got to get him
where he lives?

443
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:30,930
You mean--?

444
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,183
That's right,
his house.

445
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,435
[horns honking]

446
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,061
<i>What the--</i>
<i>Whose house is this?</i>

447
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,230
Is that David Boreanaz?

448
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,149
I could've sworn
BoJack Horseman lived here.

449
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,818
Hey, let's keep
these lines moving, huh?

450
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,361
You want to stop and chat,

451
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,196
you gotta pay for
the extended stay ticket.

452
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,198
Ah, so much,
so much, so much.

453
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,285
Another five Gs, T-Bag,
and we are in the pink.

454
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,787
I don't know,
Princess Carolyn.

455
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,830
I ran out of shoeboxes
for the money,

456
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,457
and the books
aren't adding up.

457
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,626
Plus the men's lav
needs to be serviced,

458
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,628
and I had to fire Janine
in the gift shop

459
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,504
for stealing Boreabble heads.

460
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,299
I mean, how did I end up
with all this responsibility?

461
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,509
Hey, I'm not screwing around
here, small fry.

462
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,678
You better make
those numbers sing.

463
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,097
I don't think these
offshore banks we've been using

464
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,766
are 100% legal.

465
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,226
Yeah, well, my mother told me
never to slap an idiot.

466
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,603
What?
Ow!

467
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,605
Now we're both
breaking the rules.

468
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,690
You listen,
and you listen good.

469
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,400
I've gotten used
to a certain lifestyle

470
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,110
since Boreanaz House
went public,

471
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,779
and I'm not going back
to the old way.

472
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,530
Mommy likes her shoes, see?

473
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,657
And her pearls.

474
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,617
Oh, I'm in too deep.

475
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,993
I don't know what to do.

476
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,536
<i>[BoJack] I'll tell you</i>
<i>what you should do.</i>

477
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,704
Who said that?

478
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,247
<i>It's me, David Boreanaz.</i>

479
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,583
Is that what
David Boreanaz sounds like?

480
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,001
<i>Uh, sure.</i>

481
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,711
<i>Let me give you some advice.</i>

482
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,923
<i>As we say on my show--</i>
<i>I want to say, </i>New Girl<i>?--</i>

483
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,342
<i>just keep doing what you're</i>
<i>doing, and you'll be fine.</i>

484
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,511
Wow, thanks, Davie B.

485
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,430
<i>Never call me that.</i>

486
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,892
Unbelievable.

487
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,936
It's 4:00.
I don't think anyone's coming.

Unbe-goddamn-lievable.

489
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,065
All those jerk wads
had to do was show up,

490
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,193
and they couldn't
even do that.

491
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,653
Where's the body even?

492
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,989
Beg your pardon,
minor hiccup.

493
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:15,284
My goons went to pick your
father up, but nobody was home.

494
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,744
For a nominal fee,

495
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,496
we can scrounge up
another body for you.

496
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,625
Would you care to peruse
our loaner closet?

497
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,044
[upbeat music]

498
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,505
Hey, assholes!
Where were you?

499
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,883
I planned the whole funeral,
like you asked me to,

500
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,467
and nobody showed.

501
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,135
Yeah, we realized dad
wouldn't have wanted

502
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,013
some stuffy funeral.

503
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,264
He would've wanted his body
to be chopped up into chum

504
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,642
and thrown
in Derek Jeter's fat face.

505
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,977
Yeah, suck it, Jeter!

506
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,729
Wait, what?
Where is Dad?

507
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,480
We got him chummed.
He's in the truck.

508
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,733
[horn honks]

509
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,275
You chummed Dad?

510
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,820
It's what your father wanted,
honey,

511
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,781
but then you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

512
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,157
Let me get this straight.

513
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,659
So instead of coming
to the funeral

514
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,704
that I paid for
and spent all day organizing,

515
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,832
you had Dad's body
ground into chum,

516
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,252
so you could throw his mushy

She's my ghostwriter.

to be proud of me
