00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,219
[BEEP BEEP]

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,304
YES, JIM.

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,388
HOW MUCH LONGER,
McCOY?

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,056
OH, ABOUT
ANOTHER 30 MINUTES.

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,644
I'VE COME ACROSS
SOME MOST INTERESTING
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.

6
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,061
HEY,
STARFLEET WAS RIGHT.

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,063
THESE, UH, ROOTS
AND SOIL CULTURES

8
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,440
CAN BE A MEDICAL
TREASURE HOUSE.

9
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,275
ANY PROBLEMS THERE?

10
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,236
NO SIGN OF THE INHABITANTS
SO FAR. KIRK OUT.

11
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,117
LARGE PRINTS.

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,911
THE APELIKE CARNIVORE
IN THE REPORTS?

13
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,872
YES, THE MUGATO.

14
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:38,956
NO PROBLEM, THOUGH.

15
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,166
THOSE PRINTS ARE
SEVERAL DAYS OLD.

16
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,377
THEY SELDOM STAY
AROUND IN ONE PLACE.

17
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,546
ASIDE FROM THAT,
YOU SAY IT'S
A GARDEN OF EDEN.

18
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,631
OR SO IT SEEMED
TO THE BRASH YOUNG
LIEUTENANT KIRK

19
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,758
IN COMMAND
OF HIS FIRST
PLANET SURVEY.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,554
CLASS "M" IN ALL RESPECTS.
QUITE EARTHLIKE.

21
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,598
EXCEPT THESE PEOPLE
STAYED IN THEIR
GARDEN OF EDEN.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,518
BOWS AND ARROWS
FOR HUNTING,

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,646
BUT ABSOLUTELY
NO FIGHTING
AMONG THEMSELVES.

24
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,649
REMARKABLY
PEACEFUL...

25
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:06,608
AND TRANQUIL.

26
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,403
[MAN]
HO! TAKE COVER HERE!

27
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,668
BOWS AND ARROWS, CAPTAIN?

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,587
VILLAGERS
WITH FLINTLOCKS.

29
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,838
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,758
THEY HADN'T PROGRESSED
NEARLY THAT FAR.

31
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,509
CAPTAIN, LOOK.

32
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:51,612
ONE OF THOSE MEN
WALKING INTO AMBUSH
IS TYREE--

33
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,988
THE FRIEND
I LIVED WITH HERE.

34
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:00,913
CAPTAIN...

35
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,206
USE OF OUR PHASERS
IS EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN.

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,848
VILLAGERS!

37
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,498
"ENTERPRISE," ALERT!

38
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,083
STAND BY TO BEAM UP
LANDING PARTY.

39
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,429
SPOCK?

40
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,639
YOUR PHASER!

41
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,148
NO, CAPTAIN.
I CAN TRAVEL.

42
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,157
BEAM US UP, QUICKLY.

43
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,116
NOW, SCOTTY.

44
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,367
HAVE MEDICS
STAND BY.

45
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,517
SPACE--THE FINAL FRONTIER.

46
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:55,986
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

47
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,779
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--

48
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,323
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS,

49
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,244
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,

50
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,164
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

51
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,745
WHAT HAPPENED,
CAPTAIN?

52
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,873
LEAD PROJECTILE.

53
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:50,958
PRIMITIVE FIREARM.

54
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,084
VITALIZER "B."

56
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,721
WE'RE LUCKY
HIS HEART'S WHERE
HIS LIVER SHOULD BE,

57
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,014
OR HE'D BE DEAD NOW.

58
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,975
NOT GOOD, SIR.

59
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,518

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,603

CAN YOU
SAVE HIM?

00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,730

00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,732
GO TO RED ALERT!

65
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,234
KIRK HERE.

66
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,403
UHURA, SIR.
WE HAVE A KLINGON VESSEL
ON OUR SCREENS.

67
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,863
ON MY WAY.

68
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,948
SCOTTY.

69
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,994
BONES?

70
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,162
I DON'T KNOW YET,
JIM.

71
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,247
[ALARM BLARING]

72
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,583
CAPTAIN, WE'RE
HOLDING THE PLANET

73
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,793
BETWEEN US
AND THE KLINGONS.

74
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,877
I DON'T THINK
THEY'VE SPOTTED US.

75
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,462
MAKE THAT
DEFINITE, SIR.

76
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,756
THEY'RE SENDING
A ROUTINE MESSAGE
TO THEIR HOMEBASE,

77
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:40,715
NO MENTION OF US.

78
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,051
GOOD.
GO TO YELLOW ALERT.

79
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,762
YELLOW ALERT.
ALL STATIONS,
GO TO YELLOW ALERT.

80
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,307
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN KEEP US OUT OF
THEIR SIGHT, CHEKOV?

81
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,891
I CAN TRY, CAPTAIN.

82
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,559
MESSAGE
TO STARBASE, SIR?

83
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,103
NO POINT IN
GIVING OURSELVES AWAY,
LIEUTENANT,

84
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,395
UNTIL WE FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

85
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,563
WE CAN HIDE FOR
A WHILE, SIR,

86
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,523
BUT WE MAY HAVE
TO GO OUT OF ORBIT

87
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,565
TO KEEP IT UP
FOR LONG.

88
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,067
KIRK TO SICKBAY.

89
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,154
McCOY HERE.
I'LL CALL YOU
SOON AS I KNOW ANYTHING.

90
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,280
SICKBAY OUT.

91
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,120
SO THEY'VE
BROKEN THE TREATY.

92
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,663
NOT NECESSARILY, CAPTAIN.

93
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,290
THEY HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT
TO SCIENTIFIC MISSIONS HERE

94
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,333
AS WE HAVE.

95
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,959
RESEARCH IS NOT
THE KLINGON WAY.

96
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,752
TRUE, BUT SINCE THIS IS
A HANDS-OFF PLANET,

97
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,130
HOW ARE YOU GONNA PROVE
THEY'RE DOING OTHERWISE?

98
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,217
WHEN I LEFT THERE
13 YEARS AGO,

99
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,970
THOSE VILLAGERS
HAD BARELY LEARNED
TO FORGE IRON.

100
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,974
SPOCK WAS SHOT
WITH A FLINTLOCK.

101
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,185
HOW MANY CENTURIES
BETWEEN THOSE
TWO DEVELOPMENTS?

102
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,729
ON EARTH,
ABOUT 12, SIR.

103
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,314
ON THE OTHER HAND,

104
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,191
A FLINTLOCK WOULD
BE THE FIRST FIREARM

105
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,859
THE INHABITANTS
WOULD NORMALLY
DEVELOP.

106
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,361
YES, I'M AWARE
OF THAT, MR. SCOTT.

107
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,196
AND, SIR,
THE FACT THAT EARTH
TOOK 12 CENTURIES

108
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,073
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY HAD TO.

109
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,992
WE'VE SEEN DEVELOPMENT
AT DIFFERENT RATES
ON DIFFERENT PLANETS.

110
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,409
AND IF THERE WERE
THE KLINGONS
BEHIND IT,

111
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,079
WHY DIDN'T THEY GIVE
THEM BREECHLOADERS?

112
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,080
OR MACHINE GUNS?

113
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,122
OR OLD-STYLE
HAND LASERS?

114
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,874
I DID NOT
INVITE A DEBATE.

115
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,215
I'M SORRY.

116
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,507
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT SPOCK

117
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,593
AND CONCERNED
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED

118
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,137
TO SOMETHING
I ONCE KNEW DOWN THERE.

119
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,138
YOU HAVE
THE CON, SCOTTY.

120
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,348
I'LL BE AT SICKBAY.

121
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,153
WE'VE NO REPLACEMENTS
FOR THE DAMAGED ORGANS, SIR.

122
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,613
IF HE'S GOING TO LIVE,

123
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,284
HIS VULCAN PHYSIOLOGY
WILL HAVE TO DO IT
FOR HIM.

124
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,743
AGREED.

125
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,827
STERILITE OFF.

126
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,954
YES, SIR.

127
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,004
HE'LL LIVE OR DIE NOW,
JIM.

128
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,172
I DON'T KNOW WHICH.

129
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,351
DR. M'BENGA INTERNED
IN A VULCAN WARD.

130
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,852
HE COULDN'T BE
IN BETTER HANDS.

131
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,276
THEN YOU AND I ARE
TRANSPORTING DOWN,
BONES.

132
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,986
I CAN'T LEAVE SPOCK
AT THIS TIME.

133
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,655
YOU JUST INDICATED
YOU COULD.

134
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,907
THERE ARE
KLINGONS HERE.

135
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,327
IF THEIR MISSION
IS A LEGITIMATE
RESEARCH INTEREST

136
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,163
IN THE PLANET'S
ORGANIC POTENTIAL,

137
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,248
THEN YOU'RE
THE ONE MAN
WHO CAN TELL ME.

138
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,958
AND IF THAT'S NOT IT?

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,085
THEN I NEED HELP--

140
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,629
ADVICE I CAN TRUST
AS MUCH AS SPOCK'S.

141
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,214
I APPRECIATE
THE COMPLIMENT, JIM, BUT--

142
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,468
BONES, I'M AS WORRIED
ABOUT SPOCK AS YOU ARE.

143
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,680
IF THE KLINGONS ARE
BREAKING THE TREATY...

144
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,517
IT COULD BE
INTERSTELLAR WAR.

145
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,395
KIRK TO BRIDGE.

146
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,730
BRIDGE. SCOTT HERE.

147
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,442
McCOY AND I
ARE TRANSPORTING
BACK DOWN.

148
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,069
INFORM SHIP'S STORES
THAT WE'LL NEED
NATIVE COSTUMES.

149
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,655
CAPTAIN, WE MAY HAVE TO BREAK
OUT OF ORBIT ANY MINUTE

150
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,990
TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR SIGHT.

151
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,825
WE'D BE OUT OF
COMMUNICATOR RANGE WITH YOU.

152
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,035
I UNDERSTAND.

153
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,371
WE'LL ARRANGE
A RENDEZVOUS
SCHEDULE.

154
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,541
KIRK OUT.

155
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,585
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 4211.4.

156
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,421
KEEPING OUR PRESENCE HERE
SECRET

157
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,507
IS AN ENORMOUS
TACTICAL ADVANTAGE,

158
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,008
THEREFORE I CANNOT
RISK CONTACT

159
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,510
WITH STARFLEET COMMAND.

160
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,137
I MUST TAKE ACTION
ON MY OWN JUDGMENT.

161
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,014
I HAVE ELECTED
TO VIOLATE ORDERS

162
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,558
AND MAKE CONTACT WITH
PLANET INHABITANTS HERE.

163
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,477
PERFECT.

164
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,230
TYREE'S CAMP IS
A QUARTER A MILE AWAY.

165
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,112
WANT TO THINK
ABOUT IT AGAIN, JIM?

166
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,073
STARFLEET'S ORDERS
ABOUT THIS PLANET

167
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,615
STATE
NO INTERFERENCE.

168
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,284
NO INTERFERENCE
WITH NORMAL
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.

169
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,785
I'M NOT ONLY
AWARE OF IT,

170
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,914
IT WAS MY SURVEY
13 YEARS AGO
THAT RECOMMENDED IT.

171
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,250
I READ IT.

172
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,793
"INHABITANTS SUPERIOR
IN MANY WAYS TO HUMANS.

173
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,505
"LEFT ALONE,
THEY UNDOUBTEDLY
SOMEDAY WILL DEVELOP

174
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,341

00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,646

SPEAK OF THIS

THERE'S AN OLD CUSTOM
AMONG MY PEOPLE.

410

WHEN A WOMAN
SAVES A MAN'S LIFE,

411
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,227
HE IS GRATEFUL.

00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,236

GREW FASTER
THAN OUR WISDOM,

419
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,420

DESTROYED OURSELVES.

421
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:57,009
TO MAKE A RULE
DURING ALL OUR TRAVELS--

422
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,597
NEVER TO CAUSE
THE SAME TO HAPPEN
TO OTHER WORLDS,

423
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,724
JUST AS A MAN MUST GROW
IN HIS OWN WAY

424

TO KNOW

429
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,945
THAT WE ARE WISE ENOUGH
NOT TO INTERFERE

430

OR ANOTHER WORLD.

DESTROY US?

531
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,547
RELEASE HER.

532
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,965
WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT?

533
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,593
SHE WAS DOING
AS I REQUESTED,
MR. SCOTT,

534
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,678
A VULCAN FORM
OF SELF-HEALING.

535
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,390
AS YOU SAW,
THEY MUST WAIT UNTIL
THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT,

536
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,769
THEN FIGHT THEIR WAY
BACK TO CONSCIOUSNESS.

537
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,771
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU,
MR. SPOCK.

538
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,730
THANK YOU, NURSE.

539
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:10,316
I'M QUITE
FULLY RECOVERED.

540
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,860
YES, I SEE YOU ARE.

541
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,491
MEN, THIS IS THE PAN.

542
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,785
THIS IS THE HAMMER.

543
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,161
THE HAMMER
STRIKING THE PAN
CAUSES A SPARK,

544
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,122
IGNITES THE POWDER,

545
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,916
AND FIRES
THE FLINTLOCK.

546
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,754
NOW AIM IT
AS I SHOWED YOU.

547
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,384
HOLD YOUR BREATH

548
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,678
AND SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER
GENTLY.

549
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,101
WELL DONE.

550
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,310
VERY, VERY,
VERY GOOD.

551
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,187
JIM, I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

552
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,356
NOT HERE, BONES.
IN THE CAVE.

553
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,067
YUTAN, YOUR TURN.

554
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,533
DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?

555
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,161
IT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH
THERE'S ALREADY ONE
SERPENT IN EDEN

556
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,913
TEACHING ONE SIDE
ABOUT GUNPOWDER,

557
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,748
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
SURE THEY ALL
KNOW ABOUT IT!

558
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,375
EXACTLY.
EACH SIDE RECEIVES
THE SAME KNOWLEDGE

559
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,169
AND THE SAME TYPE
OF FIREARM.

560
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,254
HAVE YOU GONE
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

561
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,464
YES, MAYBE YOU HAVE.

562
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,799
TYREE'S WIFE--

563
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,634
SHE SAID
THERE WAS SOMETHING
IN THAT ROOT.

564
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,928
SHE SAID NOW
THAT YOU CAN
REFUSE HER NOTHING.

565
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,055
SUPERSTITION.

566
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,390
IS IT A COINCIDENCE
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT SHE WANTS?

567
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,143
IS IT? SHE WANTS
SUPERIOR WEAPONS.

568
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,520
THAT'S THE ONE THING
NEITHER SIDE CAN HAVE.

569
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,897
BONES...

570
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,358
BONES, THE NORMAL
DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PLANET

571
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,319
WAS THE STATUS QUO
BETWEEN THE HILL PEOPLE
AND THE VILLAGERS.

572
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,197
THE KLINGONS CHANGED THAT
WITH THE FLINTLOCKS.

573
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,826
IF THIS PLANET
IS TO DEVELOP
THE WAY IT SHOULD,

574
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:46,579
WE MUST EQUALIZE
BOTH SIDES AGAIN.

575
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,499
JIM, THAT MEANS
YOU'RE CONDEMNING
THIS WHOLE PLANET

576
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,376
TO A WAR
THAT MAY NEVER END.

577
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,503
IT COULD GO ON
FOR YEAR AFTER YEAR,

578
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,629
MASSACRE
AFTER MASSACRE.

579
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:55,714
ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR!

580
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,182
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
SAY I'M WRONG.

581
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,308
SAY I'M DRUGGED.
SAY THE WOMAN DRUGGED ME.

582
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:15,608
WHAT IS YOUR SOBER,
SENSIBLE SOLUTION
TO ALL THIS?

583
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,652
I DON'T HAVE
A SOLUTION.

584
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,029
BUT FURNISHING THEM
FIREARMS

585
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,573
IS CERTAINLY
NOT THE ANSWER.

586
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:25,243
BONES, DO YOU REMEMBER
THE 20th-CENTURY
BRUSH WARS

587
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,286
ON THE ASIAN CONTINENT?

588
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,580
TWO GIANT POWERS INVOLVED,

589
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,415
MUCH LIKE THE KLINGONS
AND OURSELVES.

590
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,000
NEITHER SIDE FELT
THAT THEY COULD PULL OUT.

591
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,251
YES, I REMEMBER.

592
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,503
IT WENT ON
BLOODY YEAR AFTER
BLOODY YEAR.

593
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,881
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE SUGGESTED,

594
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:42,427
THAT ONE SIDE ARM ITS FRIENDS
WITH AN OVERPOWERING WEAPON?

595
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,513
MANKIND WOULD NEVER HAVE LIVED
TO TRAVEL SPACE IF THEY HAD.

596
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:52,520
NO. THE ONLY SOLUTION
IS WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN.

597
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,565
BALANCE OF POWER.

598
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:59,111
AND IF THE KLINGONS
GIVE THEIR SIDE
EVEN MORE?

599
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:03,322
THEN WE ARM OUR SIDE
WITH EXACTLY THAT MUCH MORE.

600
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,284
A BALANCE OF POWER--

601
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,327
THE TRICKIEST,
MOST DIFFICULT,

602
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,621
DIRTIEST GAME
OF THEM ALL,

603
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:14,333
BUT THE ONLY ONE
THAT PRESERVES BOTH SIDES.

604
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,753
AND WHAT ABOUT
YOUR FRIEND TYREE?

605
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:20,506
WILL HE UNDERSTAND
THIS BALANCE OF POWER?

606
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,259
NO.

607
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,928
PROBABLY NOT,

608
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:30,267
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRY
AND MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND.

609
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:37,440
I NEVER HAD A MORE
DIFFICULT TASK.

610
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:46,032
WELL, JIM,
HERE'S ANOTHER MORSEL
OF AGONY FOR YOU.

611
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,408
SINCE TYREE WON'T FIGHT,

612
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,078
HE WILL BE
ONE OF THE FIRST TO DIE.

613
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,626
WELL...

614
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,003
WAR ISN'T A GOOD LIFE,

615
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,838
BUT IT'S...LIFE.

616
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,384
HIS WIFE IS THE ONLY WAY
TO REACH HIM.

617
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,054
IF I TELL HER

618
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,639
WE'RE GOING
TO SUPPLY GUNS...

619
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,477
MAYBE...
SHE'LL CONVINCE HIM.

620
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,655
POSITION,
MR. SCOTT?

621
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:26,865
ENTERING
DISTANT ORBIT, SIR.

622
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,491
APPROACHING
RENDEZVOUS TIME.

623
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,617
THE KLINGONS?

624
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,452
THEY HAVEN'T
SPOTTED US YET, SIR.

625
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,872
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
BEAMING SOMEONE
ABOARD.

626
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,665
STAND BY
TO SIGNAL THE CAPTAIN.

627
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:36,749
AYE, SIR.

628
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,684
NONA. PARDON ME.

629
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:59,022
YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE
I WISHED YOU HERE.

630
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,024
OH? I THOUGHT
IT WAS MY IDEA.

631
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:04,485
YES. THEY ALWAYS BELIEVE
THEY COME OF FREE WILL.

632
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,611
TYREE EVEN
THOUGHT THE SAME

633
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,364
WHEN I CAST
MY FIRST SPELL ON HIM.

634
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,365
NONA--

635
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,450
CAN YOU SMELL
THIS FRAGRANCE?

636
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,579
SOME FIND IT
PLEASING.

637
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,830
I WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU.

638
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,665
AGAIN.

639
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,417
SOME FIND IT
SOOTHING.

640
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,089
YES.

641
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,173
I WOULD LIKE...

642
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,593
HAPPY.

643
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,935
YES. YOU FEEL GOOD.

644
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,912
I FEEL DIZZY.

645
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,542
YES. YOU ARE LOVELY.

646
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,969
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

647
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,930
KISS ME.

648
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,719
[GRRR]

649
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,112
OH!

650
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,531
AAH!

651
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,782
AAH!

652
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,123
NO!

653
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,304
AAH!

654
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,515
[RRRAAH]

655
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,780
WHERE'S
CAPTAIN KIRK?

656
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,199
TYREE,
THE FIRESTICK.

657
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,284
WHERE IS IT?

658
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,745
THERE!

659
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,247
I LEFT IT THERE.

660
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,916
THAT'S A FINE THING
TO LEAVE LYING AROUND.

661
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,959
SHOW US WHERE IT IS.

662
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,977
I DO NOT
WANT IT.

663
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,481
JIM!

664
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,778
JIM.

665
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,657
WHO HIT YOU?

666
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,038
NONA.

667
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,019
I BRING YOU VICTORY
FOR APELLA!

668
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,066
TYREE'S WOMAN.

669
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:13,568
SHE'S
A KAHN-UT-TU.

670
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,112
WE WON'T TRUST
THIS DIVISION TO APELLA.

671
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,197
TAKE ME TO HIM.

672
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,784
HE WILL HAVE
THE STRENGTH TO USE
THIS NEW WEAPON.

673
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,755
TOUCH ME AGAIN,

674
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,176
AND THIS SMALL BOX
WILL KILL YOU.

675
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,431
NO!

676
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,399
AAH!

677
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,484
AAH!

678
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,613
NO, NO.
I'M ALL RIGHT.

679
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:03,535
MY PHASER.

680
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,414
SHE TOOK IT.

681
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:14,295
THIS WEAPON I BRING YOU

682
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,674
IS FAR GREATER
THAN YOUR FIRESTICK.

683
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:18,757
AAH!

684
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,648
AAH!

685
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,400
AAH!

686
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,533
AAH!

687
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,618
NONA!

688
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,994
HILL PEOPLE!

689
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,079
IT'S A TRAP.

690
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,288
THE WOMAN'S
TRICKED US.

691
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,200
SHE'S DEAD.

692
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,186
I WANT
MORE OF THESE, KIRK.

693
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:39,023
MANY MORE!

694
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:43,986
YUTAN, TWO OF THOSE
WHO KILLED MY WIFE
HAVE ESCAPED.

695
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,070
TRACK THEM DOWN.

696
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:52,203
I WILL KILL THEM.

697
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:15,810
HERE.

698
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,983
TOMORROW...

699
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:26,028
IN THE PALM
OF HER HANDS.

700
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,530
WELL, YOU GOT
WHAT YOU WANTED.

701
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:30,241
NOT WHAT I WANTED,
BONES.

702
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,367
WHAT HAD TO BE.

703
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,041
KIRK HERE.

704
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,794
SPOCK, CAPTAIN.
I TRUST ALL HAS GONE WELL.

705
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,212
SPOCK,
ARE YOU ALIVE?

706
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,963
AN ILLOGICAL QUESTION,
DOCTOR,

707
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,800
SINCE OBVIOUSLY
YOU ARE HEARING MY VOICE.

708
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,343
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHY I WAS WORRIED.

709
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:52,764
YOU CAN'T KILL
A COMPUTER.

710
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,306
MR. SPOCK, ASK SCOTTY
HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE HIM

711
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,684
TO REPRODUCE
100 FLINTLOCKS.

712
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,565
I DIDN'T
GET THAT EXACTLY,
CAPTAIN.

713
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,108
100 WHAT?

714
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,611
100...

715
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,447
SERPENTS.

716
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,616
SERPENTS FOR
THE GARDEN OF EDEN.

717
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,661
WE'RE VERY TIRED,
MR. SPOCK.

718
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,750
BEAM US UP HOME.
