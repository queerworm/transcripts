HOW MUCH LONGER

00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,847
I'M GOING TO BE
ABLE TO STAND
THIS.

4
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:15,933
I FEEL LIKE
MY NECK'S

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,894
THE VULCANS
ARE THE LAST DELEGATES
WE HAVE TO PICK UP.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,396
AS SOON AS WE GET THEM
ABOARD, WE'LL BE ABLE TO RELAX.

HOW DOES THAT

24
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,771
THAT HURTS WORSE
THAN THE UNIFORM.

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,490
CAPTAIN JAMES KIRK.

00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,076

OUR PLEASURE, MADAM.

38
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,452
SOON AS YOU'RE SETTLED,
I'LL ARRANGE A TOUR

39
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,954
MR. SPOCK WILL CONDUCT YOU.

40
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,665
I PREFER ANOTHER GUIDE,

41
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,504

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,591
MR. SPOCK, WE'LL LEAVE ORBIT

00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,552

00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,286
<i>SPACE, THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

48
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:32,211
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>

49
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,715
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,509

00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,762
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>

52
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,558

00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,187
<i>WE HAVE DEPARTED VULCAN</i>

55
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,023
<i>FOR THE NEUTRAL PLANETOID</i>
<i>CODE-NAMED BABEL.</i>

56
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,483
<i>SINCE IT IS IN OUR SECTOR,</i>

57
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,527
<i>THE</i> ENTERPRISE
<i>HAS BEEN ASSIGNED</i>

58
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,571
<i>TO TRANSPORT AMBASSADORS</i>
<i>OF FEDERATION PLANETS</i>

59
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,157
<i>TO THIS VITALLY IMPORTANT</i>
<i>COUNCIL.</i>

60
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,785
<i>THE ISSUES OF THE COUNCIL</i>
<i>ARE POLITICALLY COMPLEX,</i>

61
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,869
<i>THE PASSENGERS...</i>

62
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:46,870
<i>EXPLOSIVE.</i>

63
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,081
THIS IS THE
ENGINEERING SECTION.

64
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,875
THERE ARE A NUMBER
OF EMERGENCY
BACKUP SYSTEMS

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,086
FOR
THE MAIN CONTROLS.

66
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:58,090
OVER HERE ARE
A NUMBER OF
CONTROL COMPUTERS.

67
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,550
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
AMONG HUMANS,

68
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,262
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
LEARNED TO SMILE.

69
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,847
HUMANS SMILE
WITH SO LITTLE PROVOCATION.

70
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:10,060
AND YOU HAVEN'T
COME TO SEE US
IN FOUR YEARS, EITHER.

71
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,606
THE SITUATION
BETWEEN MY FATHER
AND MYSELF

72
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,233
HAS NOT CHANGED.

73
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,277
MY WIFE, ATTEND.

74
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,199
MR. SPOCK.

75
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,035
A MOMENT,
IF YOU PLEASE.

76
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,124
YES, CAPTAIN?

77
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,626
EXPLAIN THE COMPUTER
COMPONENTS.

78
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,219
I GAVE SPOCK
HIS FIRST INSTRUCTION
IN COMPUTERS, CAPTAIN.

79
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,972
HE CHOSE TO DEVOTE
HIS KNOWLEDGE TO STARFLEET

80
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,517
INSTEAD OF
THE VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY.

81
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,105
IF YOU WILL EXCUSE
ME, CAPTAIN.

82
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,234
I'M SORRY,
AMBASSADOR.

83
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,237
I DID NOT MEAN
TO OFFEND.

84
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,280
I THOUGHT THAT--

85
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,740
OFFENSE
IS A HUMAN EMOTION.

86
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,617
I'M RETURNING
TO MY QUARTERS.

87
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,619
CONTINUE, MY WIFE.

88
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,251
MRS. SAREK,
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

89
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,544
AMANDA.

90
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,630
I'M AFRAID YOU
COULDN'T PRONOUNCE
THE VULCAN NAME.

91
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,049
CAN YOU?

92
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,259
AFTER A FASHION,
AND AFTER MANY
YEARS OF PRACTICE.

93
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,636
SHALL WE
CONTINUE THE TOUR?

94
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,638
MY HUSBAND
DID REQUEST IT.

95
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,807
IT SOUNDED MORE
LIKE A COMMAND.

96
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,227
OF COURSE.
HE'S A VULCAN.
I'M HIS WIFE.

97
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:36,980
AND SPOCK IS HIS SON.

98
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,733
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE VULCAN WAY, CAPTAIN.

99
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,109
IT'S LOGICAL.

100
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,153
IT'S A BETTER WAY
THAN OURS.

101
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,197
BUT IT'S NOT EASY.

102
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,782
IT HAS KEPT
SPOCK AND SAREK

103
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,285
FROM SPEAKING
AS FATHER AND SON
FOR 18 YEARS.

104
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,205
SPOCK IS MY BEST OFFICER...

105
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,331
AND MY FRIEND.

106
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,918
I'M GLAD HE HAS
SUCH A FRIEND.

107
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,212
IT HASN'T BEEN
EASY ON SPOCK.

108
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,630
NEITHER HUMAN
NOR VULCAN.

109
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,091
AT HOME NOWHERE

110
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,633
EXCEPT STARFLEET.

111
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,971
I TAKE IT THAT SPOCK
DISAGREED WITH HIS FATHER

112
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,598
ON A CHOICE OF CAREER.

113
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,809
MY HUSBAND HAS NOTHING
AGAINST STARFLEET.

114
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,897
BUT VULCANS BELIEVE
THAT PEACE SHOULD NOT
DEPEND ON FORCE.

115
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,150
STARFLEET FORCE
IS USED ONLY AS
A LAST RESORT.

116
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,152
WE'RE AN INSTRUMENT
OF CIVILIZATION.

117
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,238
AND IT'S A BETTER
OPPORTUNITY

118
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,241
FOR A SCIENTIST
TO STUDY THE UNIVERSE

119
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,659
THAN HE COULD AT THE
VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY.

120
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,994
PERHAPS.

121
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,705
BUT SAREK WANTED SPOCK
TO FOLLOW HIS TEACHINGS

122
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,208
AS SAREK FOLLOWED
THE TEACHINGS OF HIS
OWN FATHER.

123
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,627
THEY ARE BOTH...STUBBORN.

124
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,463
A HUMAN TRAIT, CAPTAIN?

00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,672

129
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,851

00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,895
JUST A FEW SYMBOLS.

00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,938
NOTHING INTELLIGIBLE.

133
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,899
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
BOTHERS ME, SIR.

134
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,359
IMPOSSIBLE TO LOCATE.

135
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,486
THERE WASN'T
ENOUGH OF IT.

136
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,114
SENSORS SHOW NOTHING
IN THE AREA,

137
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,825
BUT IT WAS A STRONG SIGNAL,
AS THOUGH IT WAS VERY CLOSE.

138
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,534
GO TO ALERT STATUS 4.

<i>THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEM</i>

MR. AMBASSADOR,
I UNDERSTAND
YOU HAD RETIRED

153
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,450
BEFORE THIS CONFERENCE
WAS CALLED.

154
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,909
FORGIVE MY CURIOSITY,

155
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,912
BUT AS A DOCTOR,
I'M INTERESTED
IN VULCAN PHYSIOLOGY.

156
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,332
ISN'T IT UNUSUAL
FOR A VULCAN TO RETIRE
AT YOUR AGE?

157
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,459
AFTER ALL,
YOU'RE ONLY 102.

160
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,428

164
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,940
THE VOTE WILL NOT
BE TAKEN HERE,

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,834
I WILL KNOW
WHERE HE STANDS...

173
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,211
AND WHY.

174
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,463
TELLARITES DO NOT
ARGUE FOR REASONS.

175
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,672
THEY SIMPLY ARGUE.

176
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,591
NO. YOU--

177
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,761
GENTLEMEN.
AMBASSADOR SAREK
IS QUITE CORRECT

178
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,805
WHEN HE POINTS OUT
THIS IS NOT THE COUNCIL
CHAMBER OF BABEL.

179
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,225
I AM FULLY AWARE
THAT THE ADMISSION
OF CORIDAN

180
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,143
IS A HIGHLY DEBATABLE
ISSUE,

181
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,812
BUT YOU WON'T
SOLVE IT HERE.

182
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,941
YOU ARE CORRECT, CAPTAIN.

183
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,110
QUITE LOGICAL.

184
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,070
MY APOLOGIES,
CAPTAIN.

185
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,448
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME.

186
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:21,371
HAVE YOU MET GAV
BEFORE, AMBASSADOR?

187
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,208
WE DEBATED
DURING MY LAST
COUNCIL SESSION.

188
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,501
AMBASSADOR.

189
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,170
AMBASSADOR GAV LOST.

190
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,839
SPOCK, I'VE ALWAYS
SUSPECTED

191
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,634
THAT YOU WERE
A LITTLE MORE HUMAN

192
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,928
THAN YOU LET ON.

193
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,847
MRS. SAREK,
I KNOW ABOUT THE
RIGOROUS TRAINING

194
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,057
OF THE VULCAN YOUTH,

195
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,725
BUT TELL ME,
DID HE EVER
RUN AND PLAY

196
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,147
LIKE THE HUMAN
CHILDREN, EVEN
IN SECRET?

197
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,108
WELL, HE, UH...

198
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,736
HE DID HAVE
A PET SEHLAT
HE WAS VERY FOND OF.

199
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,363
SEHLAT?

200
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,201
IT'S SORT OF A--
A FAT TEDDY BEAR.

201
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,040
A TEDDY BEAR?

202
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,960
EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR.

203
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,506
IT HAS BEEN
A RATHER LONG DAY
FOR MY WIFE.

204
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,008
CAPTAIN.

205
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,593
AMBASSADOR.

206
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,474
A TEDDY BEAR.

207
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,475
NOT PRECISELY, DOCTOR.

208
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,395
ON VULCAN,
THE TEDDY BEARS
ARE ALIVE,

209
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,856
AND THEY HAVE
6-INCH FANGS.

210
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,399
[COMMUNICATOR SIGNAL]

211
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,027
[CHEKOV]
<i>BRIDGE TO CAPTAIN KIRK.</i>

212
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,491
KIRK HERE.

ALL DUTY PERSONNEL
ON YELLOW ALERT.

DON'T ALARM THE PASSENGERS.
KIRK OUT.

218
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,465
REPORT.

219
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,133
A SMALL SHIP, CAPTAIN.

220
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,428
IT'S BEEN THERE
FIVE MINUTES, REMAINING
OUTSIDE PHASER RANGE,

221
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,889
AT EXTREME LIMIT
OF SENSORS.

222
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,516
IDENTIFICATION,
SPOCK?

223
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,519
SENSORS INDICATE
THE SIZE OF A SCOUT SHIP,

224
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,646
BUT THE CONFIGURATION
IS UNFAMILIAR.

225
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,271
MOST UNUSUAL.

226
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,524
DOES SHE ANSWER A HAIL?

227
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,650
I'VE TRIED
ALL FREQUENCIES

228
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,235
AND HOOKED IN
THE UNIVERSAL
TRANSLATOR.

229
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,195
NO RESPONSE, SIR.

230
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,113
MAINTAIN TRANSLATOR
BROADCAST.

231
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,324
CHECK RECORDS
FOR AUTHORIZED SHIPS.

232
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,868
STARFLEET RECORDS
NO AUTHORIZED VESSEL
IN THIS QUADRANT

233
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,162
EXCEPT OURS.

234
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,001
CARE TO GUESS
WHAT SHE IS?

235
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,545
GUESS, CAPTAIN?

236
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,131
I SHALL NEED MORE DATA
FOR MY ESTIMATE.

237
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,593
MR. CHEKOV, PLOT COURSE
TO INTERCEPT THAT VESSEL.

238
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,843
I WANT TO SEE
WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE CLOSE UP.

239
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,805
AYE, SIR.

240
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,141
YOU EMBARRASSED SPOCK
THIS EVENING.

241
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,186
NOT EVEN A MOTHER
MAY DO THAT.

242
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,062
HE IS A VULCAN.

243
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,106
HE'S ALSO HUMAN.

244
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,858
HE'S A STARFLEET OFFICER.

245
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,113
I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T APPROVE
OF STARFLEET.

246
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,116
IT IS NOT A QUESTION
OF APPROVAL.

247
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,119
THE FACT EXISTS--
HE IS IN STARFLEET.

248
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,623
HE MUST COMMAND RESPECT
IF HE IS TO FUNCTION.

249
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:13,710
SAREK, YOU'RE
PROUD OF HIM,
AREN'T YOU?

250
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:18,632
YOU'RE SHOWING
ALMOST HUMAN PRIDE
IN YOUR SON.

251
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,343
IT DOES NOT
REQUIRE PRIDE

252
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,139
TO ASK THAT SPOCK
BE GIVEN THE RESPECT
WHICH IS HIS DUE,

253
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,643
NOT AS MY SON,
BUT AS SPOCK.

254
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,020
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

255
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,065
NOT REALLY,
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

256
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,777
I LOVE YOU ANYWAY.

257
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,906
I KNOW.
IT ISN'T LOGICAL.

258
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,747
VESSEL CHANGING COURSE,

259
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,417
HEADING TOWARD US
AT HIGH WARP SPEED.

260
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,585
READY MAIN PHASERS.

261
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,714
PHASERS ARMED
AND READY, SIR.

262
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,350
INTERESTING.

263
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:14,145
THEY WERE TRAVELING
AT APPROXIMATELY WARP 10.

264
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,648
BACK ON ORIGINAL COURSE,
MR. CHEKOV.

265
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,483
REPORT ON
INTRUDER'S MOVEMENTS.

266
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:22,987
CAPTAIN, STARFLEET
ACKNOWLEDGES REPORT
ON OUR SITUATION

267
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,824
AND CONFIRMS--
NO AUTHORIZED
FEDERATION VESSEL

268
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,659
IN THIS QUADRANT.

269
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,163
BACK ON ORIGINAL
HEADING, CAPTAIN.

270
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,833
THE INTRUDER CHANGED COURSE
IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE DID.

271
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,168
IT'S...PARALLELING US
AGAIN.

272
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,379
WELL, WE HAVE A SHADOW.

273
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,549
FASTER, MORE MANEUVERABLE...

274
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,133
AND UNIDENTIFIED.

275
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,136
MR. SPOCK, FULL ANALYSIS
OF SENSOR READINGS.

276
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,473
I WANT TO KNOW
WHO THAT INTRUDER IS.

277
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,374
VULCAN,
I WOULD SPEAK TO YOU.

278
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,711
IT DOES SEEM UNAVOIDABLE.

279
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,589
HOW DO YOU VOTE
ON THE CORIDAN
ADMISSION?

280
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,967
YOU SEEM UNWILLING
TO WAIT

281
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,387
FOR THE COUNCIL MEETING,
AMBASSADOR.

282
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,306
NO MATTER.

283
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,560
WE FAVOR ADMISSION.

284
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,937
YOU FAVOR? WHY?

285
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,901
UNDER FEDERATION LAW,
CORIDAN CAN BE PROTECTED

286
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,863
AND ITS WEALTH ADMINISTERED
FOR THE BENEFIT
OF ITS PEOPLE.

287
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,533
THAT'S WELL FOR YOU.
VULCAN HAS NO MINING
INTEREST.

288
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,120
CORIDAN HAS
NEARLY UNLIMITED WEALTH
OF DILITHIUM CRYSTALS,

289
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,038
BUT IT IS UNDERPOPULATED

290
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,583
AND UNPROTECTED.

291
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,961
THIS INVITES ILLEGAL
MINING OPERATIONS.

292
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,171
ILLEGAL?
YOU ACCUSE US?

293
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,675
SOME OF YOUR SHIPS
HAVE BEEN CARRYING
CORIDAN DILITHIUM CRYSTALS.

294
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,803
YOU CALL US THIEVES?

295
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,846
GENTLEMEN.

296
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,431
GENTLEMEN.

297
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,144
WHATEVER ARGUMENTS YOU HAVE
BETWEEN YOURSELVES
IS YOUR BUSINESS.

298
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,772
MY BUSINESS
IS RUNNING THE SHIP.

299
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,317
AND AS LONG AS I COMMAND,
THERE WILL BE ORDER.

300
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,443
OF COURSE, CAPTAIN.

301
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,403
UNDERSTOOD.

302
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,326
THERE WILL BE PAYMENT
FOR YOUR SLANDER,
SAREK.

303
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,745
THREATS ARE ILLOGICAL.

304
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,582
AND PAYMENT
IS USUALLY EXPENSIVE.

305
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,315
SECURITY TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

306
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,108
KIRK HERE.

307
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,652
LIEUTENANT JOSEPH,
SIR.

308
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,029
I'M ON DECK 11,
SECTION A-3.

309
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,532
I'VE JUST FOUND
ONE OF THE TELLARITES
MURDERED.

310
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,618
I THINK IT'S THE
AMBASSADOR HIMSELF, SIR.

311
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,129
HOW WAS HE KILLED?

312
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,632
HIS NECK WAS BROKEN.

313
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,594
BY AN EXPERT.

314
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,179
EXPLAIN.

315
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,849
WELL, FROM THE NATURE
AND LOCATION OF THE
BREAK, I'D SAY

316
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,226
THE KILLER KNEW
EXACTLY WHERE
TO APPLY PRESSURE

317
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,853
TO SNAP THE NECK
INSTANTLY.

318
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,023
WHO ABOARD WOULD
HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE?

319
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,567
VULCANS.

320
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,318
ON VULCAN,

321
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,154
THE METHOD IS CALLED
TAL-SHAYA.

322
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,115
IT WAS CONSIDERED
A MERCIFUL FORM
OF EXECUTION

323
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,951
IN ANCIENT TIMES.

324
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,453
SPOCK...

325
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,248
A SHORT TIME AGO,

326
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:07,837
I BROKE UP AN
ARGUMENT BETWEEN
GAV AND YOUR FATHER.

327
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,630
INDEED, CAPTAIN?

328
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,715
INTERESTING.

329
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,133
INTERESTING?

330
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,719
SPOCK, DO YOU REALIZE

331
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:18,056
THAT MAKES YOUR FATHER
THE MOST LIKELY SUSPECT?

332
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,059
VULCANS DO NOT
APPROVE OF VIOLENCE.

333
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,142
ARE SAYING HE
COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT?

334
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,353
NO, CAPTAIN.
I'M MERELY SAYING

335
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,356
IT WOULD BE
ILLOGICAL TO
KILL WITHOUT REASON.

336
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,110
BUT IF HE HAD
A REASON...

337
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,529
COULD HE HAVE DONE IT?

338
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,282
IF THERE WERE A REASON,

339
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,702
MY FATHER IS QUITE CAPABLE
OF KILLING...

340
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,705
LOGICALLY AND EFFICIENTLY.

341
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,345
MRS. SAREK, I'M
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.

342
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,223
I MUST SPEAK
TO YOUR HUSBAND.

343
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,768
WELL, HE'S BEEN
GONE FOR SOME TIME.

344
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:07,229
IT'S HIS HABIT
TO MEDITATE IN PRIVATE
BEFORE RETIRING.

345
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,315
WHAT'S WRONG? SPOCK?

346
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,948
YOU WANT SOMETHING
OF ME, CAPTAIN?

347
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,951
AMBASSADOR,
THE TELLARITE GAV
HAS BEEN MURDERED.

348
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,328
HIS NECK
WAS BROKEN,
MR. AMBASSADOR,

349
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,456
BY WHAT
SPOCK DESCRIBES
AS TAL-SHAYA.

350
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:29,877
INDEED.

351
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,420
INTERESTING.

352
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,922
YES.

353
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,632
AMBASSADOR...

354
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,593
WHERE WERE YOU
DURING THE PAST
HOUR?

355
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,470
CAPTAIN, YOU'RE NOT
ACCUSING HIM?

356
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,680
MOTHER.

357
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,181
IF ONLY ON
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE,

358
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,893
HE IS A LOGICAL SUSPECT.

359
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,436
I QUITE AGREE.

360
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,440
THEN WHERE WERE YOU
DURING THE HOUR?

361
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,486
IN PRIVATE MEDITATION,
CAPTAIN.

362
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,071
SPOCK WILL TELL YOU

363
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,491
THAT SUCH MEDITATION IS
A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE,

364
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,326
NOT TO BE DISCUSSED.

365
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,828
ESPECIALLY NOT
WITH EARTHMEN.

366
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,830
WELL, THAT'S A VERY
CONVENIENT EXCUSE,
AMBASSADOR.

367
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,456
[GASPS]

368
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,916
SAREK.

369
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,584
SAREK.

370
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,045
WHAT'S WRONG?

371
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,089
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY
WITH VULCAN PHYSIOLOGY,

372
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,010
BUT I BELIEVE
IT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH
HIS CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM.

373
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,636
CAN YOU HELP HIM?

374
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,765
I DON'T KNOW
THAT YET, EITHER.

375
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,603
[SENSOR BEEPS]

376
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,865
SPOCK.

377
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,993
YES, CAPTAIN.
I GET SENSOR READINGS
OF TRI-TRITANIUM

378
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,953
FROM THE ALIEN SHIP'S HULL.

379
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,705
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

380
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,209
YES, IT COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT
OUR MISSION.

381
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,419
AREN'T YOU
WORRIED ABOUT HIM?

382
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,338
WORRY IS A HUMAN
EMOTION, CAPTAIN.

383
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,632
I ACCEPT
WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

384
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,514
THE SHIP'S HULL
SEEMS TO HAVE
A HIGH DENSITY LEVEL

385
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,517
OR IS CLOAKED AGAINST
SENSOR PROBES.

386
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,270
IT IS MANNED,
BUT SENSORS CANNOT
MAKE OUT SPECIFICS.

387
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,813
I SEE.

388
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,943
WELL, THE ROMULANS
HAVE NOTHING LIKE IT.

389
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,612
CERTAINLY NOT
THE FEDERATION
OR THE NEUTRAL PLANETS.

390
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,822
WHAT ABOUT THE KLINGONS?

391
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,491
I THINK IT UNLIKELY
IT IS ONE OF THEIRS.

392
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,868
WHO, THEN?

393
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,161
CAPTAIN?

394
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,497
I'VE PICKED UP THE LAST PART
OF A TRANSMISSION,

395
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,166
JUST LIKE THAT OTHER ONE.

396
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,045
I PUT THE RECORDER
AND THE DIRECTIONAL LOCATOR
ON IT IMMEDIATELY.

397
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,838
MR. CHEKOV,
DIRECTIONAL LOCATOR
INDICATES SOURCE

398
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,632
BEARING 27 MARK 8.

399
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,550
IT'S THE INTRUDER SHIP, SIR.

400
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,553
SWITCH RECORDER
TO MR. SPOCK'S STATION
FOR DECODE, LIEUTENANT.

401
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,598
SIR.

402
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,144
THE DIRECTIONAL LOCATOR
INDICATES...

403
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,648
RECEPTION POINT SOMEWHERE
WITHIN THE BODY
OF THIS SHIP.

404
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,776
A PERSONAL RECEIVER?

405
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,864
SOMEBODY ON BOARD
IS IN CONTACT
WITH THAT VESSEL?

406
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,241
POSSIBLY, CAPTAIN.

407
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,660
BUT I CANNOT DECODE
THIS TRANSMISSION.

408
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:08,661
WHY NOT?

409
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,955
IT IS IN NO KNOWN CODE.

410
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,665
THERE'S NO
DETECTABLE PATTERN.

411
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,749
NO STANDARD REFERENCES
APPLY.

412
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,919
ARE ANY CONCLUSIONS
POSSIBLE FROM
THE INFORMATION?

413
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,462
ONLY NEGATIVE.

414
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,965
IT FITS NONE
OF OUR COMPUTER RECORDS,

415
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,217
AND IT IS ALIEN.

416
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,302
MURDER?

417
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,929
SOMEONE OUT THERE
PLAYING TAG?

418
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:31,391
LIEUTENANT, YOU'VE GOT
YOUR SENSOR LOCATOR
ON A WIDE BEAM.

419
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,853
WE'VE ESTABLISHED A
RECEIVER ONBOARD THIS
VESSEL.

420
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:37,273
TIGHTEN YOUR FIELD
TO THE INTERIOR
OF THE SHIP.

421
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,816
YES, SIR.

422
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,195
IF THAT ALIEN VESSEL
STARTS TRANSMITTING AGAIN,

423
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,904
I WANT TO KNOW

424
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,991
WHO ON BOARD
THE ENTERPRISE
IS RECEIVING.

425
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,875
BONES, HOW IS HE?

426
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,501
WELL, AS FAR AS I CAN
TELL FROM INSTRUMENT
READINGS,

427
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,671
OUR PRIME SUSPECT HAS A
MALFUNCTION IN ONE OF
THE HEART VALVES.

428
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,299
IT'S SIMILAR
TO A HEART ATTACK
IN A HUMAN.

429
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,717
BUT WITH
VULCAN PHYSIOLOGY,

430
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:08,137
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
WITHOUT AN OPERATION.

431
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,723
MRS. SAREK,
HAS HE HAD
ANY PREVIOUS ATTACKS?

432
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,266
NO.

433
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,727
YES.

434
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,188
THERE WERE THREE OTHERS.

435
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:20,524
MY PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBED
BENJISIDRINE FOR
THE CONDITION.

436
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,442
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

437
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,444
THERE WAS NOTHING
YOU COULD HAVE DONE.

438
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,822
AMBASSADOR...

439
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,951
WHEN DID YOU HAVE
THESE ATTACKS?

440
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,954
TWO BEFORE
WE LEFT VULCAN.

441
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,958
THE THIRD,
A FEW HOURS AGO.

442
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,212
I WAS ON THE
OBSERVATION DECK.

443
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,006
WHEN THE TELLARITE
WAS MURDERED,

444
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,633
I WAS QUITE INCAPACITATED.

445
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,927
THERE WERE
NO WITNESSES?

446
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,096
NONE.

447
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,185
DOCTOR,
DO YOU PROPOSE SURGERY
FOR THE HEART DEFECT?

448
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,772
I'M NOT SURE.
IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH
ON A HUMAN.

449
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,816
ON A VULCAN,
AN ORDINARY OPERATION'S
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

450
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,568
WHY?

451
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,654
BECAUSE OF THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE VULCAN HEART.

452
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,699
I SUGGEST THAT
A CRYOGENIC OPEN-HEART
PROCEDURE

453
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,201
WOULD BE
THE LOGICAL APPROACH.

454
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,078
YES, UNQUESTIONABLY.

455
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,997
BONES,
WHAT ABOUT IT?

456
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:21,043
WELL, I'M GLAD SOMEBODY'S
ASKING ME SOMETHING
AROUND HERE.

457
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,171
WELL, THE PROCEDURE
THEY'RE DISCUSSING

458
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,674
WOULD REQUIRE
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS
OF BLOOD FOR THE PATIENT.

459
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,634
DOCTOR.

460
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,260
YES.

461
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,803
I'VE CHECKED
THE BLOOD BANK.

462
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,764
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH
VULCAN BLOOD AND
PLASMA ONBOARD

463
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,515
TO EVEN BEGIN AN
OPERATION OF
THIS TYPE.

464
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,310
THERE ARE
OTHER VULCANS
ABOARD.

465
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,395
MY BLOOD TYPE
IS T-NEGATIVE.

466
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,106
SOMEWHAT RARE,
EVEN FOR A VULCAN.

467
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,399
YES, I'D SAY THAT'S RARE.

468
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,817
MY BLOOD IS T-NEGATIVE, DOCTOR.

469
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:48,446
WE'VE RUN A NUMBER
OF BLOOD TESTS
ON MR. SPOCK.

470
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,323
IT ISN'T TRUE VULCAN
BLOOD, EITHER.

471
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:53,326
IT HAS HUMAN BLOOD
ELEMENTS IN IT.

472
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:57,288
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
TO FILTER OUT THE
HUMAN FACTORS.

473
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,080
EVEN YOU COULDN'T GIVE
THAT MUCH BLOOD, SPOCK.

474
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,290
IT WOULD KILL YOU.

475
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:00,666
BONES.

476
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,841
MRS. SAREK,
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND

477
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,051
THE CHANCES
ARE EXTREMELY SMALL

478
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,887
TO FIND A WAY
TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT
T-NEGATIVE BLOOD.

479
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,473
INDEED.

480
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,682
I WOULD ESTIMATE
THE ODDS--

481
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,184
PLEASE DON'T.

482
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,193
DOCTOR.

483
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,235
I SEE IT, SPOCK,

484
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,737
BUT THAT
WAS A RIGELIAN.

485
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,157
RIGELIAN PHYSIOLOGY
IS VERY SIMILAR
TO VULCAN.

486
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,867
"SIMILAR" IS NOT
GOOD ENOUGH.

487
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,576
IT'S STILL EXPERIMENTAL.

488
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,578
BUT IT DOES
LOOK PROMISING.

489
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,207
SPOCK, WE WOULD NEED SUCH
GREAT AMOUNTS OF BLOOD

490
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:44,043
THAT, EVEN IF THE DRUG
WORKED ON THE VULCANS,
AS WELL AS A RIGELIAN,

491
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,379
WHICH I'M DOUBTFUL,

492
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,423
IT WOULD STILL DRAIN
SAREK TO A CRITICAL LEVEL.

493
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,426
I CONSIDER THE
SAFETY FACTOR LOW,

494
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,593
BUT ACCEPTABLE.

495
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,095
PLUS THE FACT

496
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,723
I'VE NEVER OPERATED
ON A VULCAN BEFORE.

497
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:01,101
OH, I'VE STUDIED
THE ANATOMICAL TYPES.

498
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,521
I KNOW WHERE
ALL THE ORGANS ARE.

499
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,605
BUT THAT'S
A LOT DIFFERENT

500
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,484
FROM ACTUAL
SURGICAL EXPERIENCE.

501
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,111
SO IF I DON'T KILL HIM
WITH THE OPERATION,

502
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,072
THE DRUG PROBABLY WILL.

503
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,449
WHAT DRUG, DOCTOR?

504
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,995
MY HUSBAND IS ASLEEP.

505
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,663
WHAT DRUG?

506
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,956
A CHEMICAL STIMULANT

507
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,043
TO SPEED UP REPRODUCTION
AND REPLACEMENT OF BLOOD
IN THE BODY.

508
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,754
IT'S
ONLY EXPERIMENTAL.

509
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,256
IT HAS BEEN
USED SUCCESSFULLY

510
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,966
ON TEST SUBJECTS
ON RIGEL 5.

511
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,968
IT PLACES
A TREMENDOUS STRAIN

512
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,471
ON THE SPLEEN
AND THE LIVER.

513
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,972
IN SAREK'S
CONDITION,

514
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,225
THE STIMULANT
WOULD KILL HIM.

515
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,690
NURSE CHAPEL,

516
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,570
I UNDERWENT A PHYSICAL

YOU'RE GOING
TO USE IT ON YOURSELF--

522
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,917
A TRANSFUSION FROM
YOU TO YOUR FATHER?

523
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:11,046
IT WOULD SEEM
THE ONLY ANSWER.

524
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,591
IT COULD DAMAGE
YOU INTERNALLY.

525
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,633
IT COULD KILL YOU.

526
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,806
I'M SORRY, SPOCK.

527
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,017

I WAS.

694
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,809
WHEN YOU
BECAME INJURED,

695
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,268
SPOCK
ASSUMED COMMAND.

696
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,438
HE'S STAYING THERE
UNTIL YOU GET BACK
ON YOUR FEET,

697
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,607
EVEN IF IT COSTS
SAREK HIS LIFE.

698
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:51,900
REGULATIONS.

699
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,611
I CAN'T DAMN HIM
FOR HIS LOYALTY,

700
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,154
FOR DOING HIS DUTY,

701
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,280
BUT I'M NOT GOING

702
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,240
TO LET HIM
COMMIT PATRICIDE.

703
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,742
JIM, IF YOU STAND,

704
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,577
YOU COULD START
TO BLEED AGAIN.

705
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,669
BONES,

706
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,088
SAREK WILL DIE
WITHOUT THAT OPERATION,

707
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,547
AND...

708
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,341
YOU CAN'T OPERATE

709
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,677
WITHOUT TRANSFUSIONS
FROM SPOCK.

710
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,220
I'LL CONVINCE SPOCK
I'M ALL RIGHT

711
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,348
AND ORDER HIM
TO REPORT HERE.

712
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,143
AS SOON AS HE
LEAVES THE BRIDGE,

713
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,269
I'LL TURN COMMAND
OVER TO SCOTTY

714
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,355
AND REPORT
TO MY QUARTERS.

715
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,191
WILL THAT FILL
YOUR PRESCRIPTION?

716
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,163
CAPTAIN?

717
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,040
I'LL TAKE OVER,
MR. SPOCK.

718
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,624
YOU REPORT TO SICKBAY
WITH DR. McCOY.

719
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,959
CAPTAIN, ARE YOU
QUITE ALL RIGHT?

720
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,045
I'VE CERTIFIED HIM
PHYSICALLY FIT, MR. SPOCK.

721
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,755
NOW, SINCE I HAVE
AN OPERATION TO PERFORM

722
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:56,631
AND BOTH OF US
ARE REQUIRED...

723
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,467
GET OUT, SPOCK.

724
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,895
MR. CHEKOV, WHAT'S THE
STATUS OF THE INTRUDER?

725
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,479
UH, NO CHANGE, SIR.

726
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,522
MAINTAINING
ITS DISTANCE.

727
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,441
ANY FURTHER
TRANSMISSIONS,
LIEUTENANT?

728
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,318
NONE, SIR.

729
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,779
CALL MR. SCOTT
TO THE BRIDGE.

730
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,447
CAPTAIN,

731
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,950
THE ALIEN VESSEL
IS MOVING CLOSER.

732
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,954
BELAY THAT ORDER.
I'LL STAY HERE.

733
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,041
CAPTAIN, I'M PICKING UP
THE ALIEN SIGNAL AGAIN,

734
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,959
BUT IT'S COMING

735
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,086
FROM INSIDE
THE ENTERPRISE.

736
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,087
SPECIFIC ORIGIN?

737
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:36,838
FROM THE BRIG, SIR.

738
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,382
SECURITY.

739
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,760
SECURITY, TO THE BRIG.

740
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,512
SEARCH THE PRISONER
IMMEDIATELY.

741
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,481
READINGS, NURSE.

742
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,943
MR. SPOCK'S
BLOOD-REPRODUCTION RATE

743
00:37:58,068 --> 00:37:59,778
IS UP OVER 200%.

744
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,572
SAREK'S HEARTBEAT
HAS RISEN TO 324.

745
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,992
BLOOD PRESSURE--
90 OVER 40, DROPPING.

746
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,577
I WISH I KNEW

747
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,080
WHETHER THAT
WAS GOOD OR BAD.

748
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,124
INITIATE
STERILE FIELD.

749
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,460
MR. SPOCK.

750
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,545
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

751
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,922
I MUST SEE
THE CAPTAIN.

752
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,632
MY PATIENTS
DON'T WALK OUT

753
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,383
IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN OPERATION.

754
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,969
THE ALIEN SHIP--

755
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,763
I JUST REALIZED THAT
THEIR POWER UTILIZATION
CURVE IS NOT THE NORM.

756
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,347
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE...

757
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,391
TO IDENTIFY
THEM THIS WAY.

758
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,268
VERY IMPORTANT.

759
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,646
SO IS YOUR
FATHER'S LIFE.

760
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,788
UHH!

761
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,099
KIRK HERE.

762
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,267
SECURITY HERE.

763
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,978
WE HAD TO STUN
THE ANDORIAN.

764
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:18,148
HE HAD SOME SORT OF TRANSCEIVER.
IT WAS HIDDEN IN HIS ANTENNA.

765
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,774
CAPTAIN, THE ALIEN SHIP

766
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,734
HAS CHANGED COURSE
AND SPEED--

767
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,238
MOVING DIRECTLY TOWARD
US AT WARP 8.

768
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,740
BRING THE PRISONER
TO THE BRIDGE.

769
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:28,950
DEFLECTORS ON.

770
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,118
RED ALERT.

771
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:33,412
PHASERS STAND BY
TO FIRE ON MY ORDER.

772
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:34,747
AYE, SIR.

773
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,374
SHIELDS UP.

774
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,085
PHASERS MANNED
AND READY, SIR.

775
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,213
CHEKOV, TAKE OVER
SPOCK'S SCANNER.

776
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,881
AYE, SIR.

777
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,890

778
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,189

779
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,190
MOVING AWAY.

780
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,149
TURNING NOW.

781
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,234
HE'S COMING AROUND AGAIN.

782
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,694
FIRE AS HE
PASSES, ENSIGN.

783
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,531
A CLEAN MISS, SIR.

784
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,616
REPORT ON HIS
WEAPONRY, MR. CHEKOV.

785
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,785
SENSORS RECORD
STANDARD PHASERS, SIR.

786
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,329
STANDARD PHASERS.
GOOD.

787
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,248
THEY MAY HAVE
MORE SPEED,

788
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,415
BUT THEY'RE
NOT GIANTS.

789
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,959
CAPTAIN, THE
INTERCOMS ARE JAMMED.

790
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,337
ALL THE AMBASSADORS ARE
ASKING WHAT'S GOING ON.

791
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,297
TELL THEM TO TAKE
A GOOD GUESS,

792
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,091
BUT CLEAR THAT
BOARD, LIEUTENANT.

793
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:27,008
AYE, SIR.

794
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,885
HE'S COMING AROUND AGAIN.

795
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,389
[EXPLOSION]

796
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,890
ONE MORE LIKE THAT,

797
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,809
AND I'M GOING TO
LOSE BOTH THESE MEN.

798
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,156
[EXPLOSION]

799
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:53,326

CAPTAIN.

800
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,411

801
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:58,039
FIRE PHOTON TORPEDOES
2, 4, AND 6.

802
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:58,957
WIDEST POSSIBLE SCATTER.

803
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,250
AYE, SIR.

804
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,627
FIRE.

805
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,215
FULL SPREAD MISSED, SIR.

806
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,967
THEY'RE MOVING
TOO FAST FOR US.

807
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,718
[EXPLOSIONS]

808
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,016
DOCTOR,
HIS HEART'S STOPPED.

809
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,768
CARDIO-STIMULATE.

810
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,524
[EXPLOSION]

811
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,572
THE SYSTEMS ARE OFF.

812
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,617
THEN GET ME
THAT OLD PORTABLE
CARDIO-STIMULATOR.

813
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,456
AND CALL ENGINEERING

814
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,249
AND HAVE SICKBAY
SYSTEMS PUT ON PRIORITY.

815
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,459
YES, SIR.

816
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,838
NUMBER FOUR SHIELD
HAS BUCKLED, SIR.

817
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,381
AUXILIARY POWER.

818
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,049
SWITCHING OVER.

819
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,471
SHIELDS FIRMING UP.

820
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,763
NUMBER FOUR IS
STILL WEAK, SIR.

821
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,975
IF THEY HIT US THERE
AGAIN, IT'LL GO ALTOGETHER.

822
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,852
[EXPLOSION]

823
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:23,166
YOUR FRIENDS OUT
THERE ARE GOOD,

824
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,877
BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO
DESTROY THIS SHIP TO WIN.

825
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:26,794
THAT WAS INTENDED FROM
THE BEGINNING, CAPTAIN.

826
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,213
YOU'RE NOT ANDORIAN.
WHO ARE YOU?

827
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,755
[EXPLOSION]

828
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,426

830
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,602
THAT SHIP OUT
THERE HAS PHASERS.

831
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:44,354
AT LEAST OUR
WEAPONS ARE ALIKE.

832
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:47,357
NUMBER TWO SHIELD IS GONE, SIR.

833
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,692
ENGINEERING,
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

834
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,863
CUT POWER ON PORT SIDE
EXCEPT FOR PHASER BANKS.

835
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,408
AT MY SIGNAL,

836
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:57,783
CUT STARBOARD POWER.

837
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,202
KIRK OUT.

838
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,662
WHO ARE YOU?

839
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,748
FIND YOUR OWN
ANSWERS, CAPTAIN.

840
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:06,042
YOU HAVEN'T
LONG TO LIVE.

841
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,710
YOU'RE A SPY,

842
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,921
SURGICALLY ALTERED
TO PASS AS AN ANDORIAN,

843
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,048
PLANTED IN THE
AMBASSADOR'S PARTY

844
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,467
TO USE TERROR AND
MURDER TO DISRUPT US

845
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,344
AND PREPARE
FOR THIS ATTACK.

846
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,179
SPECULATION, CAPTAIN.

847
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,139

848
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,141
CUT POWER

849
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,935
MAINTAIN
UNTIL FURTHER ORDERS.

850
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,358
CHEKOV.

851
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,992
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

852
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:43,413
YOU SPECULATE.

853
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,125
WE'RE STARTING
TO DRIFT, SIR.

854
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,627
SHALL I HOLD
HER ON COURSE?

855
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,463
NO. STAND BY
YOUR PHASERS,
MR. CHEKOV.

856
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:52,630
AYE, SIR.

857
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,507
PHASERS
STANDING BY.

858
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,015
HE'S JUST HOVERING
OUT THERE, SIR.

859
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,434
LOOKING US OVER.

860
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,811
WE'RE DEAD
AS FAR AS HE KNOWS.

861
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,396
YOU'RE BAITING HIM.

862
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,857
YOU'RE TRYING
TO LURE HIM IN.

863
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,152
HERE HE COMES.

864
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:19,324

865
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,033

CLOSE TO SUBLIGHT.

866
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,995
HOLD YOUR FIRE,
MR. CHEKOV.

00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,080

00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:29,041

00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,170

871
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:42,555
GOT HIM!

872
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,149
SECURE FROM
GENERAL QUARTERS.

873
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,779
LIEUTENANT, OPEN
THE HAILING FREQUENCY.

874
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,573
IF THEY WISH
TO SURRENDER...

875
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:12,043
THEY COULD NOT
SURRENDER, CAPTAIN.

876
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,587
THEY HAD ORDERS
TO SELF-DESTRUCT.

877
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,649
LIEUTENANT, RELAY
TO STARFLEET COMMAND.

878
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,901
TELL THEM
WE HAVE A PRISONER.

879
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,986
AYE, SIR.

880
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,905
ONLY TEMPORARILY, CAPTAIN.

881
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:45,951
YOU SEE, I HAD ORDERS
TO SELF-DESTRUCT, TOO.

882
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,871
SLOW POISON.

883
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,373
QUITE PAINLESS, ACTUALLY,

884
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:54,085
BUT THERE'S
NO KNOWN ANTIDOTE.

885
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,880
I ANTICIPATE ANOTHER
10 MINUTES OF LIFE.

886
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:58,839
TAKE HIM TO SICKBAY.

887
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,092
UHH...

888
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:04,470
I SEEM TO HAVE...

889
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,097
MISCALCULATED.

890
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,729
SO DID THEY.

891
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,859
MR. CHEKOV,

892
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,612
TAKE OVER.

893
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,452
BONES.

894
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:30,455
ARE YOU QUITE THROUGH
SHAKING THIS SHIP AROUND?

895
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,706
SPOCK, SAREK--
HOW ARE THEY?

896
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,749
WELL, I DON'T
MIND TELLING YOU,

897
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,668
YOU SURE MAKE IT DIFFICULT
FOR A SURGEON TRYING--

898
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:36,877
BONES!

899
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,004
CAPTAIN, COME IN.

900
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:46,803
THAT PIG-HEADED
VULCAN STAMINA--

901
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,932
I COULDN'T HAVE
PULLED THEM THROUGH
WITHOUT IT.

902
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,643
SOME DOCTORS
HAVE ALL THE LUCK.

903
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:53,144
CAPTAIN, I BELIEVE
YOU'LL FIND THE ALIEN--

904
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:55,146
WE DAMAGED THEIR SHIP.

905
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,649
THEY DESTROYED THEMSELVES
TO AVOID CAPTURE.

906
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:00,652
BONES, THELEV'S BODY WILL
BE BROUGHT TO YOUR LAB.

907
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:01,611
I WANT AN AUTOPSY PERFORMED
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

908
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,488
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
HE'S AN ORION, DOCTOR.

909
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,490
ORION?

910
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,450
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS
THAT ORION SMUGGLERS

911
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,535
HAVE BEEN RAIDING
THE CORIDAN SYSTEM.

912
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:12,538
BUT WHAT WOULD THEY GAIN
BY AN ATTACK ON STARFLEET?

913
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:13,748
MUTUAL SUSPICION

914
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,667
AND INTERPLANETARY WAR.

915
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:18,002
YES, OF COURSE, WITH
ORION CAREFULLY NEUTRAL.

916
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,671
THEY'D CLEAN UP

917
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:21,673
SUPPLYING DILITHIUM
TO BOTH SIDES

918
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:23,758
AND CONTINUE
TO RAID CORIDAN.

919
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,594
THE THING
THAT CONFUSED ME

920
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,554
WAS THE POWER
UTILIZATION CURVE.

921
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,139
IT MADE THEM SEEM
MORE POWERFUL
THAN A STARSHIP,

922
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,307
OR ANYTHING
KNOWN TO US.

923
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,267
THAT SHIP
WAS CONSTRUCTED

924
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,268
FOR A SUICIDE
MISSION.

925
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,270
SINCE THEY
NEVER INTENDED

926
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,147
TO RETURN
TO THEIR HOME BASE,

927
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,526
THEY COULD
USE 100% POWER
ON THEIR ATTACKS.

928
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:43,486
THE THING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

929
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,989
IS WHY I DIDN'T
THINK OF IT EARLIER.

930
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,574
YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD

931
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,618
SOMETHING ELSE
ON YOUR MIND.

932
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,039
IT HARDLY SEEMS LIKELY.

933
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,208
NO, BUT THANK
YOU, ANYWAY.

934
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,668
AND YOU, SAREK,

935
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:02,213
WOULD YOU ALSO
SAY THANK YOU
TO YOUR SON?

936
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,674
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

937
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,592
WELL, FOR SAVING YOUR LIFE.

938
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,265
SPOCK ACTED IN
THE ONLY LOGICAL
MANNER OPEN TO HIM.

939
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,976
ONE DOES NOT
THANK LOGIC, AMANDA.

940
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,186
LOGIC, LOGIC--

941
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,814
I'M SICK TO
DEATH OF LOGIC.

942
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,608
DO YOU WANT TO
KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOUR LOGIC?

943
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:24,318
EMOTIONAL, ISN'T SHE?

944
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,862
SHE HAS ALWAYS
BEEN THAT WAY.

945
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,406
INDEED?
WHY DID YOU MARRY HER?

946
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,948
AT THE TIME,

947
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,411
IT SEEMED
THE LOGICAL
THING TO DO.

948
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,667
OH. BONES...

949
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:40,752
NO, NO.
I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M--

950
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:44,171
IF YOU KEEP ARGUING
WITH YOUR KINDLY
FAMILY DOCTOR,

951
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,591
YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND
YOUR NEXT 10 DAYS
RIGHT HERE.

952
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:49,552
IF YOU COOPERATE,
YOU'LL BE OUT IN TWO.

953
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,054
DOCTOR, I THINK
I'LL RETURN TO
MY STATION NOW.

954
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,181
YOU ARE AT YOUR
STATION, MR. SPOCK.

955
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,101
DR. McCOY, I BELIEVE
YOU'RE ENJOYING ALL THIS.

956
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,896
INDEED, CAPTAIN.
I'VE NEVER SEEN
HIM LOOK SO HAPPY.

957
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,564
SHUT UP!

958
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:03,900
SHH.

959
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,860
SHH!

960
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:17,954
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

961
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,082
I FINALLY
GOT THE LAST WORD.
