1
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,807
WE HAVE REACHED
PROJECTED POINT THREE,
CAPTAIN.

2
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,935
ADJUST TO NEW COURSE
201, MARK 15.

3
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,938
THANK YOU, MR. SPOCK.

4
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,448
JIM.

5
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,074
HOW IS SHE, DOC?

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,034
NO CHANGE.

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,912
SMALL THANKS
TO THE STAR FLEET.

8
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,038
NOW, REALLY,
COMMISSIONER,

9
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,790
YOU CAN'T BLAME
THE STAR FLEET.

10
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,835
I SHOULD'VE RECEIVED
THE PROPER INOCULATIONS
AHEAD OF TIME.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,213
SECURO'S DISEASE
IS EXTREMELY RARE.

12
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,298
THE CHANCES OF
ANYONE CONTRACTING IT

13
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,134
ARE LITERALLY
BILLIONS TO ONE.

14
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,262
I WAS SENT TO
EPSILON CANARUS 3

15
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,431
TO PREVENT A WAR, DOCTOR.

16
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,809
THANKS TO THE INEFFICIENCY
OF THE MEDICAL BRANCH
OF THE STAR FLEET,

17
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:02,646
I'VE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE
BEFORE MY JOB WAS DONE.

18
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,106
COMMISSIONER, I CAN
ASSURE YOU THAT ONCE WE
REACH THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

19
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,775
WITH ITS
MEDICAL FACILITIES,

20
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,820
WE'LL HAVE YOU BACK
TO YOUR JOB IN TIME FOR
YOU TO PREVENT THAT WAR.

21
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:10,487
HOW SOON WILL WE
RENDEZVOUS

22
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,156
WITH YOUR SHIP OF
YOURS, CAPTAIN?

23
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:20,581
IN EXACTLY
4 HOURS, 21 MINUTES,
COMMISSIONER.

24
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,377
CAPTAIN.

25
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,004
YEAH.

26
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,049
WILL YOU CHECK
YOUR AUTOMATIC
SCANNER, PLEASE?

27
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,930
THAT'S ODD. I'VE
NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

28
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:38,057
NOR HAVE I.

29
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,572
HEADING DIRECTLY TOWARD US
AT WARP SPEED.

30
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,413
STAYING
RIGHT WITH US.

31
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,539
SENSOR READINGS,
MR. SPOCK.

32
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,000
VAGUELY LIKE A CLOUD
OF IONIZED HYDROGEN,

33
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,210
BUT WITH STRONG ERRATIC
ELECTRICAL IMPULSES.

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,634
WE'VE GOT IT.

35
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,972
HELM DOES NOT ANSWER,
CAPTAIN.

36
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,849
NEITHER DO THE PODS.

37
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,102
COMMUNICATIONS ARE DEAD.

38
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,686
BUILDING OVERLOAD.

39
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,605
CUT ALL POWER RELAYS.

40
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,941
CUT, CAPTAIN.

41
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,571
CAPTAIN,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
I DEMAND TO KNOW.

42
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,323
YOU ALREADY KNOW
AS MUCH AS WE DO,
MISS HEDFORD.

43
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,158
WHATEVER
THAT THING IS
OUTSIDE,

44
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,411
HE YANKED US
OFF COURSE FROM
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

45
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,705
NOW ON COURSE 98, MARK 12,

46
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,291
HEADING DIRECTLY TOWARD
GAMMA CANARUS REGION.

47
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,251
JIM, WE'VE GOT TO
GET MISS HEDFORD

48
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,711
BACK TO THE
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>

49
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:50,963
HER CONDITION.

50
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:51,546
I KNOW, BONES,

51
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,590
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

52
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,717
I INSIST YOU MAKE
YOUR SCHEDULED RENDEZVOUS
WITH THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

53
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,762
MISS HEDFORD,
WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN,
WHEN WE CAN.

54
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,388
AT THE MOMENT,
WE'RE HELPLESS.

55
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,141
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
SIT BACK

56
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,643
AND ENJOY THE RIDE.

57
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,363
<i>[CAPTAIN KIRK]</i>
<i>SPACE--THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

58
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:25,747
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE.

59
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,916
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

60
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,919
<i>TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>STRANGE NEW WORLDS...</i>

61
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:34,673
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...</i>

62
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,385
<i>TO BOLDLY GO WHERE</i>
<i>NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.</i>

63
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,264
<i>ENTERPRISE,</i>
THIS IS THE<i> GALILEO.</i>

64
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,101
COME IN, PLEASE,
COME IN.

65
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,310
<i>ENTERPRISE,</i>
THIS IS THE<i> GALILEO.</i>

66
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,687
COME IN, PLEASE.

67
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,230
NO GOOD.

68
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,773
WE'RE NOT TRANSMITTING.

69
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,233
BONES?

70
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,235
OXYGEN-NITROGEN
ATMOSPHERE,

71
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,237
SOME KRYPTON,
ARGON, NEON,

72
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,864
TEMPERATURE,
75 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

73
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,324
PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL
TO EARTH ATMOSPHERE.

74
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,534
SPOCK?

75
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,326
GRAVITY IS
SIMILAR TO EARTH.

76
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,246
MOST UNUSUAL
IN VIEW OF ITS SIZE.

77
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,290
THE BULK OF THE BODY SEEMS
TO BE IRON AND NICKEL.

78
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,542
MORE THAN AN ASTEROID.

79
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,253
LIKE A SMALL PLANETOID,
I SHOULD SAY.

80
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,379
POSSIBLY A REMNANT
FROM A PLANET BREAKUP.

81
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,966
TOTALLY SUITABLE
FOR HUMAN LIFE.

82
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,300
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL GET OUT
AND GET UNDER.

83
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,342
ISSUE PHASERS.

84
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,720
BONES, MAINTAIN
FULL ALERT.

85
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:04,846
COMMISSIONER,
IF YOU'LL STAY
INSIDE.

86
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,142
JUST HOW LONG AM
I SUPPOSED TO STAY
INSIDE, CAPTAIN?

87
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,269
THAT'S
A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

88
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,187
I WISH
I COULD ANSWER IT.

89
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,897
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

90
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,495
TAKE A LOOK AROUND, BONES.

91
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,636
MOST UNUSUAL.

92
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,639
UNLIKELY.

93
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,349
IN FACT, CAPTAIN,

94
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,392
I WOULD SAY
QUITE IMPOSSIBLE.

95
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,853
NOTHING WRONG
AND NOTHING WORKS.

96
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,395
PRECISELY.

97
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:54,855
MUST BE A REASON.

98
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,231
OBVIOUSLY.

99
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,151
LET'S LOOK
A LITTLE FURTHER.

100
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,949
JIM, I JUST TOOK
A TRICORDING SWEEP,

101
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,328
AND I GOT THE
EXACT SAME READINGS,
ALMOST, AS SPOCK GOT

102
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,745
WHEN WE WERE
PULLED OFF COURSE.

103
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,289
THE IONIZED CLOUD.

104
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,833
I THINK SO, ONLY IT
READS HERE ON THE
SURFACE WITH US.

105
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,295
IT'S OFF IN THAT DIRECTION,
AND IT DOESN'T READ SOLID.

106
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,255
IT'S MORE UNSTABLE,
TENUOUS,

107
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,716
LIKE A COLLECTION
OF GASES.

108
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,178
HELLO!

109
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,642
HELLO!

110
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:35,645
FASCINATING.

111
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,980
BONES, GET
A PHYSIOLOGICAL
READING ON THAT,

112
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,733
WHATEVER IT IS.

113
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,609
HELLO!

114
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,538
ARE YOU REAL?

115
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,376
I MEAN, I'M NOT
IMAGINING YOU, AM I?

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,585
WE'RE REAL ENOUGH.

117
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,756
YOU SPEAK ENGLISH.

118
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,174
EARTH PEOPLE?

119
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,093
FROM THE FEDERATION.

120
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,635
THE F--

121
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:09,971
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

122
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,933
I'M COCHRANE.
I'VE BEEN MAROONED HERE
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG.

123
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:17,604
IF YOU ONLY KNEW
HOW GOOD IT IS
TO SEE YOU.

124
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,147
AND A WOMAN.

125
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,733
BEAUTIFUL ONE AT THAT.

126
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,320
I'M CAPTAIN
JAMES T. KIRK,

127
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,487
COMMANDING
THE STARSHIP
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>

128
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,283
THIS IS
MY FIRST OFFICER
MR. SPOCK.

129
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,742
YOU'RE A VULCAN,
AREN'T YOU?

130
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,368
CORRECT.

131
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,827
CHIEF SURGEON
LEONARD McCOY.

132
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:33,870
DOCTOR.

133
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,372
PLEASURE.

134
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,957
OH, AND EXCUSE ME,

135
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,583
ASSISTANT FEDERATION
COMMISSIONER HEDFORD.

136
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,127
MA'AM.

137
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,672
YOU'RE FOOD
TO A STARVING MAN.

138
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,260
ALL OF YOU.

139
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,641
HEY, THAT'S A NICE SHIP.

140
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,813
SIMPLE AND CLEAN.

141
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,066
BEEN TRYING
TO GET HER
TO GO AGAIN?

142
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,611
WELL, FORGET IT.
IT WON'T WORK.

143
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,364
HE'S HUMAN, JIM.

144
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,658
EVERYTHING CHECKS OUT
PERFECTLY.

145
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,576
MR. COCHRANE.

146
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,834
WE WERE FORCED
OFF OUR COURSE

147
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,296
AND TAKEN HERE BY SOME FORCE
WE COULDN'T IDENTIFY.

148
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,131
WHICH SEEMS TO BE
ON THE SURFACE

149
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,049
OF THIS BODY
AT THE MOMENT.

150
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,844
WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

151
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,346
YOU SAY
WE'LL BE UNABLE

152
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,597
TO GET THE SHIP TO
FUNCTION AGAIN?

153
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,434
NOT A CHANCE. THERE'S
SOME SORT OF DAMPING
FIELD DOWN HERE.

154
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,936
POWER SYSTEMS DON'T WORK.
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

155
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,189
YOU DON'T MIND
IF WE CONTINUE
TO TRY?

156
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:45,900
GO RIGHT AHEAD.
YOU GOT PLENTY OF TIME.

157
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,902
WHAT ABOUT YOU, COCHRANE?

158
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,030
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

159
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,698
MAROONED, I TOLD YOU.

160
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,700
LOOK, WE'LL HAVE
LOTS OF TIME

161
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,535
TO LEARN
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

162
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,496
I HAVE A SMALL PLACE
OVER THAT WAY--

163
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,872
ALL THE COMFORTS
OF HOME.

164
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,125
I CAN EVEN OFFER YOU
A HOT BATH.

165
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,961
HOW PERCEPTIVE OF YOU TO
NOTICE THAT I NEEDED ONE.

166
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,421
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
MR. COCHRANE,

167
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,507
I'D LIKE A LITTLE MORE
THAN JUST A STATEMENT

168
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,424
THAT YOU WERE
MAROONED HERE.

169
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,718
IT'S A LONG WAY OFF
THE BEATEN PATH.

170
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:12,886
THAT'S RIGHT.

171
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,847
THAT'S WHY I'M
SO GLAD TO SEE YOU.

172
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,099
LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU
EVERYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW,

173
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,519
BUT NOT HERE.

174
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,896
YOUR SHIP
IS SURE A BEAUTY.

175
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,023
YES, SHE IS.

176
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,484
YOU'VE BEEN
OUT OF CIRCULATION
QUITE A WHILE.

177
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,361
THE PRINCIPLES
MAY BE NEW TO YOU.

178
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,196
MR. SPOCK...

179
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,908
WHY DON'T YOU
EXPLAIN OUR METHODS
OF PROPULSION

180
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,743
TO MR. COCHRANE?

181
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,794
TALKS A LOT,
BUT HE DOESN'T SAY MUCH.

182
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,671
I'VE NOTICED
SOMETHING ELSE.

183
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,797
WHAT'S THAT?

184
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,966
HE LOOKS FAMILIAR.

185
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,385
FAMILIAR?

186
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,388
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
HE DOES.

187
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,891
I CAN'T QUITE
PLACE HIM, BUT...

188
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,726
WHAT ABOUT
MISS HEDFORD?

189
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,521
NO TEMPERATURE YET,

190
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,316
BUT WE GOT TO
GET UNDER WAY SOON, JIM.

191
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,068
I GUARANTEE YOU,
IT WILL DEVELOP.

192
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,070
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

193
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,742
TAKE COCHRANE UP
ON HIS OFFER.

194
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,954
YOU BUILT THIS,
MR. COCHRANE?

195
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,291
YES. I HAD
TOOLS AND SUPPLIES
LEFT OVER FROM MY CRASH.

196
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,542
NOT BAD.

197
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,461
NOT EARTH, OF COURSE,
BUT IT'S LIVABLE.

198
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,921
I GROW VEGETABLES
IN THE FIELDS OVER
THAT NEXT RIDGE.

199
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,756
COME ON IN.

200
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,145
ALL THE COMFORTS OF HOME
INDEED, MR. COCHRANE.

201
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,856
WHERE'D YOU GET
THE ANTIQUES?

202
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,067
WHAT, YOU MEAN
MY INSTRUMENTS?

203
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,988
I IMAGINE THINGS
HAVE CHANGED A LOT
SINCE I CRASHED.

204
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,823
NOT THAT MUCH.

205
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,286
MUST YOU KEEP IT
SO TERRIBLY HOT IN HERE?

206
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,538
TEMPERATURE'S
A CONSTANT 72 DEGREES.

207
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,334
LET ME GET YOU
SOMETHING COOL TO DRINK.

208
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,918
DO YOU FEEL HOT?

209
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,920
I FEEL INFURIATED,

210
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,547
DEEPLY PUT UPON,

211
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,549
AND ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGED.

212
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,010
IT WAS QUITE A HIKE HERE.

213
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,638
YOU'RE TIRED.
JUST TAKE IT EASY
FOR A WHILE.

214
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,764
I'LL REST LATER,
DOCTOR.

215
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:25,977
TEMPERATURE,
CAPTAIN.

216
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:26,978
FIRST SIGN.

217
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,438
YES, I KNOW.

218
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,897
IT MEANS WE'RE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

219
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,732
CAPTAIN,
DOCTOR.

220
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,713
WHAT WAS THAT?

221
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,426
WELL, SOMETIMES THE LIGHT
PLAYS TRICKS ON YOU.

222
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,261
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
WHAT I'VE IMAGINED

223
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,889
I'VE SEEN AROUND
HERE SOMETIMES.

224
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,891
WE IMAGINED NOTHING,
MR. COCHRANE.

225
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,934
THERE WAS AN ENTITY
OUT THERE,

226
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,021
AND I SUSPECT IT WAS
THE SAME ENTITY WHICH
BROUGHT US HERE.

227
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,730
PLEASE EXPLAIN.

228
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,901
THERE'S NOTHING
TO EXPLAIN.

229
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:15,652
THANK YOU.

230
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,446
YOU'LL FIND I HAVE
A VERY LOW TOLERANCE LEVEL

231
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,823
WHERE THE SAFETY
OF MY PEOPLE
ARE CONCERNED.

232
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,326
WE FIND YOU OUT HERE,
WHERE NO HUMAN HAS
ANY BUSINESS BEING.

233
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,286
WE WERE VIRTUALLY HIJACKED
IN SPACE AND BROUGHT HERE.

234
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,455
NOW, I'M NOT
JUST REQUESTING AN
EXPLANATION, MISTER.

235
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,831
I'M DEMANDING ONE.

236
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,126
ALL RIGHT.

237
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,922
IT WAS THE COMPANION.

238
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:36,797
THE WHAT?

239
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,008
THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT.

240
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,595
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
CAPTAIN, I DIDN'T
CRASH HERE.

241
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,472
I WAS BROUGHT HERE
IN MY DISABLED SHIP.

242
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,600
I WAS ALMOST DEAD.
THE COMPANION
SAVED MY LIFE.

243
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,269
YOU WERE INJURED?

244
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,145
I WAS DYING,
MR. SPOCK.

245
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,482
YOU SEEM PERFECTLY
ALL RIGHT NOW.

246
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:54,982
WHAT WAS THE MATTER?

247
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,902
I WAS AN OLD MAN.

248
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,404
YOU WERE WHAT?

249
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,490
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
HOW IT DID IT,

250
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,158
BUT THE COMPANION
REJUVENATED ME,

251
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,621
MADE ME YOUNG AGAIN,
LIKE I AM NOW.

252
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,500
I PREFER TO
RESERVE JUDGMENT

253
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,586
ON THAT PART
OF YOUR STORY, SIR.

254
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,879
MEANWHILE, WOULD YOU
PLEASE EXPLAIN EXACTLY

255
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,674
WHAT THIS COMPANION
OF YOURS IS?

256
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,926
I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

257
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,511
IT EXISTS, IT LIVES,

258
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,055
AND I CAN
COMMUNICATE WITH IT.

259
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,974
THAT'S A PRETTY
FAR-OUT STORY.

260
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,601
MR. COCHRANE...

261
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,896
DO YOU HAVE
A FIRST NAME?

262
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:34,981
ZEFRAM.

263
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,525
ZEFRAM COCHRANE...

264
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,779
OF ALPHA CENTURI...

265
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,156
THE DISCOVERER
OF THE SPACE WARP?

266
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,532
THAT'S RIGHT, CAPTAIN.

267
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,117
BUT THAT'S
IMPOSSIBLE.

268
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:51,247
ZEFRAM COCHRANE DIED
150 YEARS AGO.

269
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,058
[SPOCK]
THE NAME OF
ZEFRAM COCHRANE

270
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,019
IS REVERED THROUGHOUT
THE KNOWN GALAXY.

271
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,354
PLANETS WERE
NAMED AFTER HIM.

272
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,896
GREAT UNIVERSITIES,
CITIES.

273
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,192
ISN'T YOUR STORY
A LITTLE IMPROBABLE,
MR. COCHRANE?

274
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,820
NO, IT'S TRUE. I WAS 87
YEARS OLD WHEN I CAME HERE.

275
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,030
YOU SAY
THIS...COMPANION

276
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,240
FOUND YOU
AND REJUVENATED YOU?

277
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,493
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN SPACE AT
THE AGE OF 87?

278
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,952
I WAS TIRED, CAPTAIN.

279
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,164
I WAS GONNA DIE, AND
I WANTED TO DIE IN SPACE,
THAT'S ALL.

280
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,583
TRUE. HIS BODY
WAS NEVER FOUND.

281
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,044
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT,
MR. SPOCK.

282
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:42,423
IF SO, YOU WEAR YOUR AGE
VERY WELL.

283
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,091
[DR. McCOY]
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

284
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,594
TERRIBLE.
HOW SHOULD I FEEL?

285
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,054
YOU'RE RUNNING
A LITTLE TEMPERATURE.

286
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,389
PERHAPS
YOU SHOULD LIE DOWN.

287
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,015
DOCTOR, WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?

288
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,309
IT'S THE HEAT.

289
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,438
ALL RIGHT.

290
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,899
TRY TO RELAX.

291
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,569
JIM...

292
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,404
IT'S STARTED,
THE FEVER.

293
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,113
IT'S OVER 100,
AND IT'S CLIMBING.

294
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,866
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE?

295
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,576
A MATTER OF HOURS,
THAT'S ALL.

296
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:18,292
MR. COCHRANE, YOU SAY
YOU WERE BROUGHT HERE
150 YEARS AGO?

297
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,587
YOU DON'T LOOK A DAY
OVER 35.

298
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,589
I HAVEN'T AGED.
THE COMPANION SEES TO THAT.

299
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,716
CAPTAIN...

300
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,217
THESE INSTRUMENTS,

301
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,302
THEY DATE FROM
THE TIME INDICATED.

302
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,346
FROM YOUR SHIP,
MR. COCHRANE?

303
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,931
I CANNIBALIZED IT.

304
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,725
THE FOOD, WATER, GARDENS,
EVERYTHING ELSE I NEED,

305
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,309
THE COMPANION GIVES ME.

306
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,562
APPARENTLY, IT CREATES IT
OUT OF THE NATIVE ELEMENTS.

307
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,857
YOU SAY YOU CAN
COMMUNICATE WITH IT.

308
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,694
PERHAPS YOU CAN FIND OUT
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

309
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,655
I ALREADY KNOW.

310
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,157
YOU WOULDN'T MIND
TELLING US?

311
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,117
YOU WON'T LIKE IT.

312
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,535
I ALREADY
DON'T LIKE IT.

313
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,294
YOU'RE HERE
TO KEEP ME COMPANY.

314
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,921
YOU MEAN
YOU BROUGHT US HERE?

315
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,423
NO. THE COMPANION DID.

316
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,008
I TOLD IT
I'D DIE OF LONELINESS.

317
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,010
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD RELEASE ME.

318
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,054
INSTEAD,
IT BROUGHT YOU HERE.

319
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,139
NO!

320
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,058
NO!

321
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,017
NO!

322
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,020
THAT'S DISGUSTING!

323
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,232
WE'RE NOT ANIMALS!

324
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,530
NO!

325
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,407
OH, NO!
IT'S INHUMAN!

326
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,033
NO!

327
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,244
NO!

328
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,216
SPOCK, RUN ADDITIONAL
TRICORDER READINGS.

329
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,802
LEARN ANYTHING YOU CAN.

330
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,762
FIND ME A WEAPON TO
USE AGAINST THIS THING.

331
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:53,763
YOU ASK ME TO
FIND A WEAPON?

332
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,056
DO YOU INTEND
TO DESTROY IT?

333
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,267
I INTEND TO DO
WHATEVER'S NECESSARY

334
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,812
TO GET US
OFF THIS PLANET

335
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,814
AND COMMISSIONER HEDFORD
TO THE HOSPITAL.

336
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,732
IF THE COMPANION
STANDS IN THE WAY,

337
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,067
THEN WE PUSH IT
OUT OF THE WAY.
CLEAR, SPOCK?

338
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,569
QUITE CLEAR, CAPTAIN.

339
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,405
VERY WELL.
YOU HAVE YOUR ORDERS.

340
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,246
MR. COCHRANE,
IF YOU LEFT HERE,

341
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,708
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
TO YOU?

342
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,544
I'D BEGIN TO AGE AGAIN--
NORMALLY.

343
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,380
DO YOU WANT
TO LEAVE HERE?

344
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:31,009
BELIEVE ME, CAPTAIN,
IMMORTALITY CONSISTS
LARGELY OF BOREDOM.

345
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,722
WHAT'S IT LIKE
OUT THERE IN THE GALAXY?

346
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,558
WE'RE ON 1,000 PLANETS
AND SPREADING OUT.

347
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,103

FANTASTIC DISTANCES,

348

MILLIONS OF PLANETS

TO MAP THEM.
INTERESTING?

352
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,282
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO
GO TO SLEEP FOR 150 YEARS

353
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,618
AND WAKE UP
IN A NEW WORLD?

354
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,704
IT'S ALL OUT THERE
WAITING FOR YOU.

355
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,915
BUT WE'LL NEED YOUR
HELP TO GET AWAY.

356
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,833
YOU'VE GOT IT.

357
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,570
[THUNDERBOLT]

358
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:45,917
YOU SEEM TO THINK
THIS COMPANION OF YOURS

359
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,543
CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING.

360
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,045
I SAID
IT WAS VERY POWERFUL.

361
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,880
COULD IT CURE HER?

362
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:51,881
I DON'T KNOW.

363
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,008
HOW DO YOU
COMMUNICATE WITH IT?

364
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,135
IT'S ON A NONVERBAL LEVEL,
BUT I USUALLY GET
MY MESSAGE ACROSS.

365
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,554
WE'VE GOT TO TRY.
WE'RE HELPLESS.

366
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,140
SEE IF IT CAN
DO SOMETHING.

367
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,496
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

368
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:27,792
I JUST SORT OF
CLEAR MY MIND,
AND IT COMES.

369
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,717
BONES, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THAT?

370
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:22,972
ALMOST A SYMBIOSIS
OF SOME KIND,

371
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,473
SORT OF JOINING.

372
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,725
EXACTLY WHAT I THINK.

373
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,439
NOT EXACTLY
LIKE A PET OWNER

374
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:36,318
SPEAKING TO
A BELOVED ANIMAL,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

375
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,444
NO.

376
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,988
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

377
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,032
AGREED.

378
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,953
MORE LIKE...

379
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,454

380
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,804
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

381
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,766
YES.

382
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,476
IT KIND OF DRAINS ME
A LITTLE, BUT I'M
ALL RIGHT.

383
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,937
WELL?

384
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,856
THE COMPANION
CAN'T DO ANYTHING
TO HELP MISS HEDFORD.

385
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,191
THEN SHE'LL DIE.

386
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:19,695
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I COULD DO TO HELP,
I WOULD, AND I WILL,

387
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,575
BUT WE CAN EXPECT NOTHING
FROM THE COMPANION.

388
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,499
SPOCK!

389
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,127
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

390
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,669
YES.

391
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,297
QUITE ALL RIGHT,
DOCTOR.

392
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,927
A MOST FASCINATING
THING HAPPENED.

393
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,305
APPARENTLY,
THE COMPANION
IMPARTED TO ME

394
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,350
A RATHER QUAINT,
OLD-FASHIONED
ELECTRIC SHOCK

395
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,978
OF RESPECTABLE
VOLTAGE.

396
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,729
IT ATTACKED YOU?

397
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,273
EVIDENTLY.

398
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,692
UNQUESTIONABLY,
A LARGE PART OF
ITS SUBSTANCE

399
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,612
IS SIMPLE
ELECTRICITY.

400
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,201
OH, YES.

401
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,746
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST
OR A PHYSICIST,
MR. SPOCK,

402
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,498
BUT AM I CORRECT
IN ASSUMING

403
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,541
THAT ANYTHING THAT
GENERATES ELECTRICITY

404
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,169
CAN BE SHORTED OUT?

405
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:19,005
QUITE CORRECT, DOCTOR.

406
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,007
PUT THIS
IN THE PROXIMITY
OF THE COMPANION,

407
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,050
THROW THIS SWITCH,

408
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,261
AND IT WILL
SCRAMBLE EVERY
ELECTRICAL IMPULSE

409
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,180
THE CREATURE
CAN PRODUCE.

410
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,015
IT CANNOT FAIL.

411
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,609
IT TROUBLES YOU,
COCHRANE?

412
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,031
THE COMPANION
SAVED MY LIFE.

413
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:49,535
IT'S TAKEN CARE OF ME
ALL THESE YEARS.

414
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,495
WE'VE BEEN VERY CLOSE

415
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,831
IN A WAY
THAT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

416
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,374
I SUPPOSE I EVEN HAVE
A SORT OF AFFECTION
FOR IT.

417
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,376
IT'S ALSO
KEEPING YOU PRISONER.

418
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,130
I DON'T WANT IT
KILLED.

419
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,381
IT MAY SIMPLY
RENDER IT POWERLESS.

420
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,052
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW.
YOU COULD KILL IT.

421
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,427
I WON'T STAND FOR THAT,
KIRK.

422
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,805
WE'RE GETTING OUT
OF HERE, COCHRANE.
FACE UP TO IT.

423
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,642
I'LL DO ANYTHING I HAVE TO
TO SAVE ALL OF OUR LIVES.

424
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:23,819
I SUPPOSE FROM
YOUR POINT OF VIEW,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

425
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,197
WE UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL,
MR. COCHRANE,

426
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,367
BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE.

427
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,119
ALL RIGHT.

428
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,538
YOU WANT ME
TO CONTACT IT?

429
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,539
PLEASE.

430
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,375
OUTSIDE.

431
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:47,176
WHAT WAS IT
THEY USED TO CALL IT,

432
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,387
THE JUDAS GOAT?

433
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,694
THERE IS SOME RISK,
CAPTAIN.

434
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,155
WE DO NOT KNOW
THE EXTENT
OF ITS POWERS.

435
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,865
NOR IT OURS.

436
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,462
NOW.

437
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,286
STOP IT!

438
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,620
YOU'RE KILLING THEM!

439
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,464
STOP IT, PLEASE!

440
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,048
STOP IT!

441
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,092
YOU'RE CHOKING THEM!
LET THEM GO.

442
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,594
YOU'RE CHOKING THEM!

443
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,931
STOP IT!

444
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,536
YOU ALL RIGHT, JIM?

445
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,498
YEAH,
WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

446
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,759
COCHRANE GOT IT
OFF OF US.

447
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,595
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
HE DID US A FAVOR
OR NOT.

448
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,597
WHAT KIND OF TALK
IS THAT?

449
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,099
HOW DO YOU FIGHT
A THING LIKE THAT?

450
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,726
I'VE GOT THE SHIP
UP THERE SOMEWHERE,

451
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,520

FOUR LIVES DOWN HERE--

452
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,771
ONE OF THEM DYING
BECAUSE OF ME.

453
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,440
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT.

454
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,900
I'M IN COMMAND, BONES.

455
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,860
IT MAKES IT MY FAULT.

456
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:14,156
HOW DO YOU FIGHT
A THING LIKE THAT?

457
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,824
MAYBE YOU'RE
A SOLDIER SO OFTEN

458
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,828
THAT YOU FORGET
YOU'RE ALSO TRAINED
TO BE A DIPLOMAT.

459
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,123
WHY NOT TRY A CARROT
INSTEAD OF A STICK?

461
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,675

463
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,055
WE CAN TRY THAT,

464
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,597
TALK TO THAT THING.

465
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,100
THE TRANSLATOR IS FOR
USE WITH MORE CONGRUENT
LIFE FORMS.

466
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,768
ADJUST IT.
CHANGE IT.

467
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,103
THE TROUBLE WITH
IMMORTALITY
IS IT'S BORING.

THE TRANSLATOR

469
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,646
WILL GIVE YOU
SOMETHING TO DO.

470
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,482
IT'S POSSIBLE.
IF I COULD WIDEN ITS
PATTERN OF RECEPTION--

471
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:49,942
RIGHT DOWN YOUR
ALLEY, SPOCK.

472
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:50,943
GET IT HERE
AND GET TO WORK.

473
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,027
AND THAT THING
IS STILL
OUT THERE.

474
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,071
BETTER
GO THAT WAY.

475
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,325
ANY CHANGE?

00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,994

IT MEANS, MR. SCOTT?

510
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,294
THE SHUTTLECRAFT
WAS ON SCHEDULE

UNTIL IT WAS SHY
5 HOURS OF RENDEZVOUS.

HAPPENED.

BEHIND THIS DEVICE?

531
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,430

THE NECESSARY GRAMMAR.

537
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,069

539
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,697

541
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:46,118

00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,537

YES. THE MATTER OF GENDER

603
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,374
THE IDEA OF MALE

CONSTANTS, COCHRANE.

604

00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,681
YOU'RE NOT A SPECIMEN

610
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:18,891

611

HER ATTITUDE
WHEN SHE APPROACHES YOU

613
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,355
IS PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT
THAN WHEN SHE CONTACTS US.

614
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,483
HER APPEARANCE IS
SOFT, GENTLE.

615
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,904
HER VOICE IS
MELODIC, PLEASING.

616
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,447
I DO NOT TOTALLY
UNDERSTAND THE EMOTION,

617
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,825

FOR ALL THESE YEARS,

621
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,920
I'VE LET SOMETHING
AS ALIEN AS THAT

622
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,671
CRAWL AROUND
INSIDE ME,

623
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,048

00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:51,882

00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,299

DIDN'T IT?

626
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,969
THAT THING FED
ON ME, USED ME.
IT'S DISGUSTING.

627
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,637
THERE'S NOTHING
DISGUSTING ABOUT IT.

628
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,723
IT'S JUST ANOTHER

631
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,479

YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE COMPANION

633
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,527
HAS FOR 150 YEARS BEEN
EMOTIONALLY SATISFYING,

634
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,906
EMINENTLY PRACTICAL,
AND TOTALLY HARMLESS.

635
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,408

BEEN QUITE BENEFICIAL.

00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,020
TO AN EXISTENCE
HE WILL FIND UNBEARABLE.

695
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:37,190
HE WILL CEASE TO EXIST.

696
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,109
<i>HE DOES NOT AGE.</i>

697
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,694
<i>HE REMAINS FOREVER.</i>

698
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,238
YOU SPEAK OF HIS BODY.

699
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,073
I SPEAK OF HIS SPIRIT.

700
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:48,827
COMPANION,
INSIDE THE SHELTER,

701
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,037
A FEMALE OF OUR SPECIES
IS DYING.

702
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:54,624
SHE WILL NOT CONTINUE.

703
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,252
THAT IS WHAT
WILL HAPPEN TO THE MAN

704
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,088
UNLESS YOU RELEASE
ALL OF US.

705
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,381
<i>I...</i>

706
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,550
<i>DO NOT UNDERSTAND.</i>

707
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,930
OUR SPECIES...

708
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,224
CAN ONLY SURVIVE...

709
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,644
IF WE HAVE OBSTACLES
TO OVERCOME.

710
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,188
YOU...

711
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:19,565
TAKE AWAY ALL OBSTACLES.

712
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,526
WITHOUT THEM
TO STRENGTHEN US,

713
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,862
WE WILL WEAKEN AND DIE.

714
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,533
YOU REGARD THE MAN
ONLY AS A TOY.

715
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:29,951
YOU AMUSE YOURSELF
WITH HIM.

716
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,370
<i>YOU ARE WRONG.</i>

717
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,832
<i>THE MAN IS THE CENTER</i>
<i>OF ALL THINGS.</i>

718
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,376
<i>I CARE FOR HIM.</i>

719
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:43,048
BUT YOU CAN'T
REALLY LOVE HIM.

720
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:46,051
YOU HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST
KNOWLEDGE OF LOVE,

721
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,386
THE TOTAL UNION
OF TWO PEOPLE.

722
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,347
YOU ARE THE COMPANION.
HE IS THE MAN.

723
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,683
YOU ARE
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

724
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,061
YOU CAN'T JOIN.

725
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,690
YOU CAN'T...

726
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,607
LOVE.

727
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,321
YOU MAY KEEP HIM HERE
FOREVER...

728
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,909
BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE SEPARATE...

729
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,371
APART FROM HIM.

730
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,336
<i>IF...</i>

731
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,088
<i>I WERE HUMAN...</i>

732
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,299
<i>THERE CAN BE...</i>

733
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,344
<i>LOVE?</i>

734
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,031
WHAT DID YOU HOPE
TO GAIN BY THAT, JIM?

735
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,490
TRY TO CONVINCE HER

736
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,325
OF THE HOPELESSNESS
OF IT.

737
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,869
LOVE SOMETIMES
EXPRESSES ITSELF

738
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,495
IN SACRIFICE.

739
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,415
I THOUGHT MAYBE
IF SHE LOVED HIM,

740
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,041
SHE'D LET HIM GO.

741
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,711
BUT SHE OR IT
IS INHUMAN, CAPTAIN.

742
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,839
YOU CANNOT EXPECT HER
TO REACT LIKE A HUMAN.

743
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,300
I TRIED.

744
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:11,052
IT'S USELESS.
I KNOW.

745
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,138
<i>ZEFRAM COCHRANE.</i>

746
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,193
BONES?

747
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,571
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

748
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,865
SHE'S NOT SICK
AT ALL.

749
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,742
WE UNDERSTAND.

750
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,620
IT'S HER.

751
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,248
WHAT?

752
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,417
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
IT'S THE COMPANION.

753
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,752
BONES?

754
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,588
SHE'S PERFECTLY
HEALTHY.

755
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,215
HEART LIKE A HAMMER.

756
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,091
RESPIRATION NORMAL.

757
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,093
BLOOD PRESSURE
NORMAL.

758
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,595
THIS IS MEDICALLY
IMPOSSIBLE.

759
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,056
WE ARE HERE.

760
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,057
WE?

761
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,642
BOTH OF US--

762
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,853
THOSE YOU KNEW
AS THE COMMISSIONER

763
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,688
AND THE COMPANION.

764
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,983
WE ARE BOTH HERE.

765
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,777
COMPANION,
YOU DO NOT HAVE THE POWER

766
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,404
TO CREATE LIFE.

767
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,740
THAT IS FOR THE MAKER
OF ALL THINGS.

768
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,494
BUT COMMISSIONER HEDFORD
WAS DYING.

769
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,039
THAT PART OF US

770
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,666
WAS TOO WEAK
TO HOLD ON.

771
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,670
IN A MOMENT, THERE WOULD
HAVE BEEN NO CONTINUING.

772
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,797
NOW WE'RE TOGETHER.

773
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:36,054
THEN YOU ARE BOTH HERE,
IN THE ONE BODY?

774
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,680
WE ARE ONE.

775
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,564
ZEFRAM...

776
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,775
WE FRIGHTEN YOU.

777
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,320
WE'VE NEVER
FRIGHTENED YOU BEFORE.

778
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,246
LONELINESS.

779
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,421
THIS IS LONELINESS.

780
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,716
OH, WHAT A BITTER THING.

781
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,886
OH, ZEFRAM,
IT'S SO SAD.

782
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,846
HOW DO YOU BEAR IT,
THIS LONELINESS?

783
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,435
SPOCK, CHECK OUT
THE SHUTTLECRAFT--

784
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,480
ENGINE, COMMUNICATIONS,
EVERYTHING.

785
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,733
THAT WILL NOT
BE NECESSARY, CAPTAIN.

786
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,194
YOUR VEHICLE WILL OPERATE
AS BEFORE.

787
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,447
SO WILL
THE COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE.

788
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,741
YOU'RE LETTING US GO?

789
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,581
WE COULD DO NOTHING NOW
TO STOP YOU.

790
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,586
YOU SAID WE
WOULD NOT KNOW LOVE

791
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,170
BECAUSE WE WERE NOT HUMAN.

792
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,671
NOW WE ARE HUMAN.

793
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,673
WE'LL KNOW
THE CHANGE OF THE DAYS.

794
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,551
WE WILL KNOW DEATH.

795
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,309
BUT TO TOUCH
THE HAND OF THE MAN,

796
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,144
NOTHING IS AS IMPORTANT.

797
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:09,147
YOU'RE VERY BEAUTIFUL.

798
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,398
PART OF ME...

799
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,484
UNDERSTANDS.

800
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:15,403
PART DOES NOT.

801
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:17,322
BUT IT PLEASES ME.

802
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:20,158
I COULD EXPLAIN...
MANY THINGS.

803
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:24,329
OH, LET ME WALK, ZEFRAM.

804
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:27,081
LET ME FEEL THE EARTH
AGAINST MY FEET.

805
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,794
LET ME FEEL THE WARMTH
OF THE SUN ON MY FACE.

806
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,298
YOU BESIDE ME--

807
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,258
LET ME
FEEL THESE THINGS.

808
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,970
GO AHEAD, COCHRANE.

809
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:44,223
WE HAVE A FEW THINGS TO DO.

810
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,577
MR. SCOTT,
IT'S THE CAPTAIN.

811
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,788
PUT HIM ON.

812
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,543
LOCK ON TO
HIS COORDINATES.

813
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:14,045
CAPTAIN, THIS IS SCOTTY.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

814
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,880
PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT.
CAN YOU GET A FIX ON US?

815
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:18,216
THE HELM IS COMPUTING
YOUR POSITION NOW, CAPTAIN.

816
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:21,427
COURSE 224, MARK 12.

817
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:23,429
E.T.A. 57 MINUTES.

818
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:26,098
WE'LL BE THERE
IN 57 MINUTES, SIR.

819
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,684
VERY GOOD. I'LL CONTINUE
TRANSMITTING.

820
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,311
ASSUME STANDARD ORBIT
WHEN YOU ARRIVE.

821
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,605
WE'LL TRANSPORT UP
IN THE SHUTTLECRAFT.

822
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:33,814
WHAT HAPPENED, CAPTAIN?

823
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,732
INTERESTING STORY, SCOTTY.

824
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,403
I CAN'T TELL YOU NOW
BECAUSE, QUITE FRANKLY,

825
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,737
I DON'T KNOW HOW
IT'S GOING TO END.

826
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,614
KIRK OUT.

827
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,411
EVERYTHING WILL BE
AN EYE-OPENER TO YOU.

828
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:51,666
THERE'S A THOUSAND
PLANETS OUT THERE,
A THOUSAND RACES.

829
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,336
I'LL SHOW EVERYTHING TO YOU,
SOON AS I LEARN
MY WAY AROUND AGAIN.

830
00:45:55,461 --> 00:46:00,216
MAYBE I CAN MAKE UP
A LITTLE FOR EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

831
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,431
I CAN'T GO WITH YOU,
ZEFRAM.

832
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:10,101
OF COURSE YOU CAN.
YOU HAVE TO.

833
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:16,190
MY LIFE EMANATES
FROM THIS PLACE.

834
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,192
IF I SHOULD LEAVE IT
FOR MORE THAN
A TINY MARCH OF DAYS,

835
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,153
I'LL CEASE TO EXIST.

836
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,406
I MUST RETURN, EVEN AS
YOU MUST CONSUME MATTER

837
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:24,616
TO MAINTAIN YOUR LIFE.

838
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:27,201
YOU MEAN YOU GAVE UP
EVERYTHING TO BE HUMAN?

839
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:37,462
BUT EVEN IF YOU STAY HERE,
YOU'LL EVENTUALLY DIE.

840
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,966
THE JOY OF THIS HOUR...

841
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,551
I AM PLEASED.

842
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:46,887
I CAN'T JUST FLY AWAY
AND LEAVE YOU HERE.

843
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,308
YOU MUST BE FREE,
ZEFRAM COCHRANE.

844
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:53,102
YOU SAVED MY LIFE...

845
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,729
TOOK CARE OF ME.

846
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,148
YOU LOVED ME.

847
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,609
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD.

848
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,531
I DO NOW.

849
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:21,964
WE'RE LOCKED IN, CAPTAIN.

850
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,341
STANDARD ORBIT ESTABLISHED.

851
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:25,884
SHUTTLECRAFT BAY STANDING
BY TO RECEIVE YOU.

852
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,553
STAND BY, SCOTTY.

853
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:37,062
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> IS
WAITING, MR. COCHRANE.

854
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,105
I CAN'T TAKE HER
AWAY FROM HERE.

855
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,607
IF I DO, SHE'LL DIE.

856
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:43,110
IF I LEAVE HER,
SHE'LL DIE OF LONELINESS.

857
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:46,280
I OWE EVERYTHING TO HER.

858
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,283
I CAN'T LEAVE HER.
I LOVE HER.

859
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,409
IS THAT SURPRISING?

860
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,869
NOT COMING
FROM A HUMAN BEING.

861
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,289
YOU ARE, AFTER ALL,
ESSENTIALLY IRRATIONAL.

862
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,874
THINK IT OVER,
MR. COCHRANE.

863
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,335
THERE'S A WHOLE
GALAXY OUT THERE

864
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,003
WAITING
TO HONOR YOU.

865
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,549
I HAVE HONORS ENOUGH.

866
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,883
BUT YOU WILL AGE,
BOTH OF YOU.

867
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,094
THERE WILL BE
NO IMMORTALITY.

868
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,013
YOU'LL BOTH
GROW OLD HERE...

869
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,889
AND FINALLY DIE.

870
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,351
THAT'S BEEN HAPPENED TO
MEN AND WOMEN FOR A LONG TIME.

871
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,102
I'VE GOT THE FEELING IT'S
ONE OF THE PLEASANTER THINGS

872
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,313
ABOUT BEING HUMAN,

873
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,691
AS LONG AS
YOU GROW OLD TOGETHER.

874
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:25,277
ARE YOU SURE?

875
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,071
THERE'S PLENTY
OF WATER HERE.

876
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,948
THE CLIMATE'S GOOD
FOR GROWING THINGS.

877
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,159
I MIGHT EVEN TRY
AND PLANT A FIG TREE.

878
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,871
A MAN'S ENTITLED
TO THAT, ISN'T HE?

879
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:40,209
IT ISN'T GRATITUDE,
CAPTAIN.

880
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,086
NOW THAT I SEE HER...

881
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,671
TOUCH HER...

882
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,964
I KNOW THAT I LOVE HER.

883
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,091
WE'LL HAVE A LOT
OF YEARS TOGETHER.

884
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,802
THEY'LL BE HAPPY ONES.

885
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,264
ALL THE BEST.

886
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,603
CAPTAIN...

887
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:02,147
DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT ME.

888
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,068
NOT A WORD,
MR. COCHRANE.

889
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:13,033
JIM, WHAT ABOUT THAT WAR
ON EPSILON CANARUS 3?

890
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,326
WELL, I'M SURE
THE FEDERATION

891
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,412
CAN FIND ANOTHER WOMAN
SOMEWHERE

892
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,290
WHO'LL STOP THAT WAR.
