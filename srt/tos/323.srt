STARDATE 5943.7.

00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,959
WE HAVE CALCULATED THAT

00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:14,083

00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:18,041
ITS ONLY SATELLITE, SARPEIDON,
IS A CLASS "M" PLANET,

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,792
WHICH, AT LAST REPORT,
WAS INHABITED

6
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:22,250
BY A CIVILIZED
HUMANOID SPECIES.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,458
NOW OUR INSTRUMENTS SHOW
THAT NO INTELLIGENT LIFE
REMAINS ON THE PLANET.

8
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,375

WE DETECTED

9
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,041
IS IN THIS BUILDING,
CAPTAIN.

10
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,583
ANY SIGN
OF SURVIVORS?

11
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,583
NO SIGNS OF
SAPIENT LIFE FORMS.

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,917
HOW CAN
A WHOLE PLANET
FULL OF PEOPLE

13
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:37,041
JUST DISAPPEAR?

14
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,542
IF THEY KNEW THAT
THEIR SUN WAS DYING,

15
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,625
IT COULD BE ANYTHING
UP TO MASS SUICIDE.

16
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:44,834

THAT THEY HAD ANY
SPACE FLIGHT CAPABILITY.

17
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,250

TO BE AN ARCHIVE

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,166

OF SOME KIND.

00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,834

A LITTLE SURPRISED

I HAD THOUGHT
THAT EVERYONE
HAD LONG SINCE GONE.

31
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:19,542
BUT THE SURPRISE IS
A PLEASANT ONE.

32
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:22,542
AFTER ALL, A LIBRARY
SERVES NO PURPOSE

33
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:24,000
UNLESS SOMEONE IS
USING IT.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,333

WHERE'D THEY GO?

35
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,417
IT DEPENDED ON

OF COURSE.

DIFFICULT TO CHOOSE.
IS THAT IT?

41
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:44,667
YES, A WIDE RANGE

IS A MIXED BLESSING,

42
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,417
BUT PERHAPS
I CAN HELP.

THIS WAY, PLEASE?

AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,

64
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,917
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

65

AS SOON AS WE KNEW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,792
FORGIVE ME, SIR.
IT IS MY FAULT.

67
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,792

MISCALCULATED.

THAT THERE WAS
NO ONE HERE AT ALL.

00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,709
EVERYONE ON THIS PLANET
WAS WARNED OF THE COMING
NOVA LONG AGO.

71
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,917
THEY FOLLOWED
INSTRUCTIONS
AND ARE NOW SAFE,

72
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,125

DO THE SAME.

TO GO, OF COURSE.

77
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:44,959

00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,625
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME?

174
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,667
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHETHER I CAME THROUGH
SOME KIND OF DOOR?

175
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:45,125
OOH, I THINK
THE RUM GULL MUST HAVE
KICKED YOU IN THE HEAD.

176
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,000
COME ON, LUV.
I KNOW A LIEGE WHO
WILL ASK NO QUESTIONS.

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,041
NO. NO, IT MUST
BE HERE SOMEPLACE.

178
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,125
MCCOY: JIM!

179
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,083
JIM, CAN YOU
HEAR US?

180
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,583
BONES? SPOCK?

181
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,125
SPOCK: CAPTAIN!

182
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,250
WE HEAR YOU,
BUT WE CANNOT SEE YOU.

183
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,709
SPOCK: ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

184
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:04,625
WE MUST HAVE MISSED
EACH OTHER SOMEHOW.

185
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,500
SPOCK: AGREED.

186
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,417
APPARENTLY THEY
HAVE ALL ESCAPED

187
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,041
THE DESTRUCTION
OF THEIR WORLD

188
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,166
BY RETREATING
INTO ITS PAST.

189
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,000
MERCY ON US.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,125
IT'S SPIRITS!

191
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,583
NO, NO. THESE ARE

IN THE LIBRARY?

194
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,417
INDEED NOT.

195
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:24,542
WE'RE IN A WILDERNESS
OF ARCTIC CHARACTERISTICS.

00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,041
HE MEANS IT'S COLD!

197
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,000
CAN YOU GET BACK
TO THE LIBRARY?

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
THERE IS NO LIBRARY,
CAPTAIN,

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,208
AT LEAST NOT
THAT WE CAN SEE.

200
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,125
WE ARE AT THE BASE
OF AN ICE CLIFF.

201
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,375
EXPLAIN.

202
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,000
JUST BEFORE YOU
DISAPPEARED, CAPTAIN,

203
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,375
I DISCOVERED A MACHINE
WHICH MR. ATOZ CALLED
THE ATAVACHRON.

204
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,959
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
TIED INTO THE TAPE
VIEWER SOMEHOW.

205
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,208
OPENING TIME PORTALS
TO THE PAST.

206
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,208
YOU CROSSED THROUGH
INTO THE PERIOD
WHICH YOU WERE VIEWING.

207
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,333
I WAS LOOKING OVER
SOME MATERIAL
ABOUT THEIR ICE AGE.

208
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,000
AND I AM HERE EVIDENTLY

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,959
BECAUSE I STEPPED THROUGH
AT THE SAME INSTANT
AS DR. MCCOY.

210
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,333
YES.

211

00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,166
THERE'S THE MORT'S

ARREST HIM.

215
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:18,166
WE ARE THE LAW
AND DO REQUIRE
THAT YE YIELD TO US.

216
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,083
ON WHAT CHARGE?

217
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,208
THIEVERY
AND PURSE-CUTTING.

218
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,083
THAT IS A MISTAKE.
I'M NO THIEF.

219
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,959

HONEST MEN APPROACH!

223

AT HIS BIDDING.

226
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,959
STOP HIS MOUTH,
AND THEY'LL QUIET.

227
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,083

CLOSE TO THE PORTAL.

228
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,458

229
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,625
JIM! WHAT'S
THE MATTER?!

230
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:47,959
JIM SOUNDED LIKE
HE WAS IN TROUBLE.

231
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,542
WE MAY BE IN TROUBLE
OURSELVES.

232
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,750
WE MUST FIND SHELTER.

233
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,166
IN THIS SEVERE COLD,
WE CANNOT SURVIVE
MUCH LONGER.

234
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,083
LEAVE ME HERE, SPOCK.

235
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,041
WE GO TOGETHER
OR NOT AT ALL.

DON'T BE A FOOL.

237
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:26,250

ARE FROSTBITTEN.
I CAN'T FEEL MY FEET.

238
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,000
ALONE YOU HAVE A CHANCE.
NOW, DO WHAT I SAY.

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,291
GO TRY TO FIND JIM.

240
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,291
WE GO TOGETHER.

241
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:36,375
YOU STUBBORN,

FROM THE SEVERITY
OF YOUR WEATHER.

00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,166
HE IS THE DOCTOR,
NOT I.

245
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,333
I'LL AVOID GIVING HIM
ANY MEDICATION
AT THIS TIME.

246
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:12,458
PERHAPS, IF HE'S KEPT
QUIET AND WARM, HE MAY
RECOVER NATURALLY.

247
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,750
IT IS AGREEABLY
WARM HERE.

256
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:57,375
THIS IS
ONE OF THE PLACES
ZORCON SENDS PEOPLE

257
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:01,583
WHEN HE WANTS THEM
TO DISAPPEAR.

258
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,375
DIDN'T YOU
COME IN THROUGH
THE TIME PORTAL?

259
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,041
YES, WE CAME THROUGH
THE TIME PORTAL,
BUT NOT AS PRISONERS.

260
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,041
WE WERE SENT HERE
BY MISTAKE.

261
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,291
OH.

262
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,041
THE ATAVACHRON
IS FAR AWAY,

263
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:18,375
BUT I THINK YOU
COME FROM SOMEPLACE
FARTHER THAN THAT.

264
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,417
THAT IS TRUE.

265
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:22,417
I AM NOT FROM THE WORLD

347
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,125
NO. WE ARE STILL
IN THE ICE AGE,

348
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,375
BUT SAFE
FOR THE MOMENT.

349
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,417
JIM.

350
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,250
WHAT ABOUT JIM?

351
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,750
DOCTOR, YOU'RE IN NO
CONDITION TO GET UP.

352
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,333
YOU LIE DOWN
AND REST.

353
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,333
I SHALL ATTEMPT
TO FIND THE CAPTAIN.

354
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,250
YOU FIND HIM,
SPOCK.

355
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,792
DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT ME.

356
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:56,208
YOU JUST
FIND HIM.

357
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,583
SPOCK...

358
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,542
WHO IS THIS JIM?

359
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:25,250
HE'S OUR
COMMANDING OFFICER...

360
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:25,875
AND OUR FRIEND.

361
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,083
I SAW ONLY
THE TWO OF YOU.

362
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:28,792
I DID NOT KNOW
THERE WAS ANOTHER.

363
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:32,041
HE DID NOT COME WITH US.
HE WAS SENT THROUGH
THE TIME PORTAL

364
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:36,500
TO ANOTHER PERIOD
IN HISTORY MUCH LATER
THAN THIS ONE.

365
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,291
IF I AM TO FIND HIM,

366
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,917
THERE'S ONLY ONE
POSSIBLE AVENUE.

367
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:44,917
ZARABETH,
WILL YOU SHOW ME

368
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:48,375
WHERE THE TIME
PORTAL IS?

369
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:52,250
BUT YOUR FRIEND--
HE IS ILL.

370
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,125
THAT IS TRUE.

371
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,166
IF I LEAVE HIM,
THERE'S A CHANCE

372
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,291
HE MAY NEVER
REGAIN THE SHIP.

373
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,375
HE WOULD
THEN BE MAROONED
IN THIS TIME PERIOD,

374
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,834
BUT HE IS NO LONGER
IN DANGER OF DEATH,

375
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:03,709
SO MY PRIMARY DUTY
TO HIM HAS BEEN
DISCHARGED.

376
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:06,959
AND IF I
REMAIN HERE,

377
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,375
NO ONE OF OUR PARTY

378
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,375
WOULD BE ABLE TO AID
CAPTAIN KIRK.

379
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,875
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE AN EQUATION.

380
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:17,333
WELL, IT SHOULD BE
AN EQUATION.

381
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,041
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO RESOLVE THIS
PROBLEM LOGICALLY.

382
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:28,333
PERHAPS IT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE ATAVACHRON.

383
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:33,333
IF ONLY I KNEW MORE
ABOUT HOW IT WORKED.

384
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,709
ZARABETH,

385
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:38,542
YOU SAID THAT YOU
WERE BROUGHT HERE
AS A PRISONER.

386
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,583
MAY I ASK--

387
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:43,500
WHY?

388
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,792
MY CRIME WAS IN CHOOSING
MY KINSMEN UNWISELY.

389
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:53,917
TWO OF THEM WERE
INVOLVED IN A CONSPIRACY
TO KILL ZORCON.

390
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,959
I REMEMBER THAT NAME
FROM THE HISTORY TAPES
IN THE LIBRARY--

391
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,834
ZORCON THE TYRANT.

392
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:03,208
IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT
HE EXECUTE MY KINSMEN.

393
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,834
ZORCON DETERMINED
TO DESTROY OUR ENTIRE FAMILY.

394
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:09,834
HE USED THE ATAVACHRON
TO SEND US PLACES NO ONE
COULD EVER FIND US.

395
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:13,834
ZARABETH, WE MUST
RETURN TO MR. ATOZ
AND THE ATAVACHRON.

396
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,834
WE WILL CARRY
DR. MCCOY, AND YOU
MUST COME WITH US.

397
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:20,125
I WILL SEND YOU
AND THE DOCTOR
TO THE SHIP,

398
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,041
AND I SHALL SEARCH
FOR CAPTAIN KIRK.

399
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,917
I CAN'T GO THROUGH
THE PORTAL AGAIN.

400
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:28,083
IF I DO, I WILL DIE.

401
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:34,083
WE CANNOT GO BACK?

402
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,542
NONE OF US CAN
GO BACK.

403
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:41,083
WHEN WE COME
THROUGH THE PORTAL,

404
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,125
WE ARE CHANGED
BY THE ATAVACHRON.

405
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,208
THAT IS ITS FUNCTION.

406
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:50,375
OUR BASIC CELL STRUCTURE
IS ADJUSTED TO
THE TIME WE ENTER.

407
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,875
YOU CAN'T GO BACK.

408
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:00,041
IF YOU GO THROUGH
THE PORTAL AGAIN,

409
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,000
YOU WILL DIE
BY THE TIME YOU REACH
THE OTHER SIDE.

410
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,583
MCCOY: SPOCK.

411
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:09,250
WHERE ARE WE?

412
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,375
YOU ARE SAFE
HERE, MCCOY.

413
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,834
YES. I REMEMBER YOU.

414
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:17,959
COME, DOCTOR.
BACK TO BED.

415
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:25,959
WHY ARE YOU
STILL HERE, SPOCK?

416
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,083
WHY AREN'T YOU
LOOKING FOR JIM?

417
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:31,792
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO LOOK FOR HIM, DOCTOR.
WE CANNOT GO BACK.

418
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:34,792
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IMPOSSIBLE? WE'VE
GOT TO GET BACK.

419
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:36,667
ZARABETH
EXPLAINED IT TO ME.

420
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,500
WHEN WE CAME THROUGH
THE TIME PORTAL,

421
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,291
IT ALTERED OUR
PHYSIOLOGICAL STRUCTURE.

422
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,542
IF WE ATTEMPT TO RETURN
TO THE LIBRARY,

423
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,834
WE SHALL DIE.

424
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:50,458
ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME THAT
WE'RE TRAPPED HERE?

425
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:53,959
YES, DOCTOR,
WE ARE TRAPPED...

426
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:58,333
JUST AS JIM IS TRAPPED
WHEREVER HE IS.

427
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,083
KIRK, VOICE-OVER:
CAPTAIN'S LOG, STARDATE 5943.9.

428
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,458
THE PEOPLE OF THIS TIME
BELIEVE IN WITCHES,

429
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,959
AND WITCHCRAFT IS WHAT
I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF.

430
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,792
FIVE WITNESSES HEARD
MCCOY'S VOICE SPEAK TO ME

431
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:14,083
AND THOUGHT IT WAS
AN EVIL SPIRIT.

432
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,458
FROM WHAT I KNOW
OF WITCHCRAFT TRIALS,

433
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:20,959
I DON'T HAVE MUCH CHANCE
UNLESS I CAN GET TO
THE PROSECUTOR.

434
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:25,250
NO SUPPER FOR YOU, LUV.

435
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:30,917
COME ON.

436
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,875
UP YOU GO.

437
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,542
[DOOR CLOSES]

438
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:50,291
GIVE ME YOUR CUP.

439
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:01,458
CRY OUT,
AND I'LL BREAK IT.

440
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,083
DON'T MOVE.

441
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:47,375
JAILER!

442
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,875
JAILER!

443
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:54,208
I'M BEING
FALSELY ACCUSED.
YOU KNOW THAT.

444
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,333
YOU WILL
COME WITH ME

445
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:58,250
BEFORE
THE INQUISITIONAL
TRIBUNAL.

446
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,041
THERE, THE MATTER
OF YOUR WITCHCRAFT
WILL BE DECIDED.

447
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,458
JAILER!
THERE ARE
NO SUCH THINGS
AS WITCHES!

448
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,709
THAT IS SACRILEGE.
IF THEY HEAR YOU,

449
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:08,458
THEY WILL BURN YOU
FOR SUCH BELIEFS.

450
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:11,208
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN HEAR ME,
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.

451
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,917
THERE ARE NO WITCHES.
WHY DO YOU DENY IT?

452
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:16,291
DO NOT LET THEM
HEAR YOU.

453
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:17,875
THERE ARE WITCHES!

454
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,291
THERE ARE!

455
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,041
YOU YOURSELF
MAY BE DISCOVERED

456
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,583
TO BE A WITCH
BY THE INQUISITOR.

457
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,333
NO!

458
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,083
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

459
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,208
NO! NO! NO!

460
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,458
AAH! HELP!

461
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:40,417
I'LL DENOUNCE YOU
TO THE INQUISITOR.

462
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:43,834
YOU CAME HERE
FROM THE FUTURE,
JUST AS I DID.

463
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,208
THEREFORE, YOU, TOO,
ARE A WITCH.

464
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:49,583
I BEG YOU,
DO NOT IMPLICATE ME.
THEY WOULD BURN ME.

465
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,125
THEN HELP ME.

466
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,750
I WILL DO
EVERYTHING I CAN

467
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,709
TO PROVE YOU
INNOCENT.

468
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:57,875
I WILL DISPROVE
ALL THE CHARGES
OF WITCHCRAFT.

469
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,834
BUT YOU MUST
NEVER AGAIN SPEAK

470
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,166
TO THE COMRADES
YOU LEFT BEHIND.

471
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,417
HELP ME RETURN
TO THE LIBRARY.

472
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:05,125
I'VE LOST MY WAY.
I MUST GET BACK THERE.

473
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,000
YOU CANNOT GET BACK.

474
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,417
I TELL YOU I MUST!

475
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:10,875
I HAD TWO FRIENDS WITH ME,

476
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,834
WHO ARE LOST
IN ANOTHER TIME PERIOD.

477
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,750
I MUST FIND THEM.
YOU'LL COME BACK WITH US.

478
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,041
WE CAN NEVER
GO BACK.

479
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:21,041
WE MUST LIVE OUT
OUR LIVES HERE
IN THE PAST.

480
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:24,125
THE ATAVACHRON
HAS PREPARED
OUR CELL STRUCTURE

481
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,083
AND OUR BRAIN
PATTERNS

482
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,750
TO MAKE LIFE
NATURAL HERE.

483
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,250
TO RETURN
TO THE FUTURE WOULD
MEAN INSTANT DEATH.

484
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,917
PREPARED?

485
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:38,291
I WAS NOT PREPARED.

486
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:41,500
YOUR MR. ATOZ DID NOT
PREPARE ME IN ANY WAY.

487
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
THEN YOU MUST
GET BACK AT ONCE.

488
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,000
IF YOU WERE NOT
TRANSFORMED,

489
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,875
YOU CAN ONLY SURVIVE
FOR A FEW HOURS

490
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:50,875
HERE IN THE PAST.

491
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,875
COME. HURRY! HURRY!

492
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:04,500
ZARABETH, YOU ARE
A BEAUTIFUL COOK.

493
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,417
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TOLD THAT?

494
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:07,500
NOT RECENTLY.

495
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,375
OH, WELL, YOU'LL FIND
THAT SPOCK IS QUITE DELINQUENT
IN THOSE MATTERS.

496
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,917
I HADN'T NOTICED IT.

497
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:17,125
OH?

498
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:22,125
WELL, NOW THAT I'M
FEELING BETTER,

499
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:25,083
YOU'LL NOTICE
A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE
IN OUR APPROACH.

500
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,291
REALLY?

501
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,750
IT'S SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

502
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,333
I THINK YOU MUST BE
WELL ENOUGH, DOCTOR,

503
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,917
TO TRY THE FEW DELICACIES
THIS CLIMATE HAS TO OFFER.

504
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:34,166
NO, NOT YET.

505
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,500
AT YOUR RATE OF PROGRESS,
IT WILL BE SOON. I CAN SEE.

506
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,041
DR. MCCOY IS MAKING
EXCELLENT PROGRESS.

507
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:43,500
AND MR. SPOCK HAS BEEN
PRACTICING MEDICINE
WITHOUT A LICENSE.

508
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,959
NOW, DON'T LET HIM
DOCTOR YOU.

509
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:47,333
I'M THE DOCTOR
AROUND HERE.

510
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,375
AND KNOWN
AS THE WORST PATIENT

511
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,542
IN THE ENTIRE CREW
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

512
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:54,208
WONDER WHERE SHE IS.

513
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,959
5,000 YEARS
IN THE FUTURE.

514
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:02,959
THANK YOU.

515
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,917
I WONDER
WHERE JIM IS.

516
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:22,750
WHO KNOWS?

517
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,041
WE CAN ONLY HOPE
THAT HE'S WELL,
WHEREVER HE IS.

518
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:28,458
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WE CAN ONLY HOPE?

519
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,291
HAVEN'T YOU DONE
ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

520
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:31,417
WHAT WAS THERE TO DO?

521
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:34,417
COULD LOCATE THE PORTAL.
IT CAN'T BE TOO FAR.

522
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,417
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
ALL THAT, DOCTOR.

523
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:41,875
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF REHASHING THAT SUBJECT?

524
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:45,041
WE CAN'T GET BACK.
WASN'T THAT CLEAR TO YOU?

525
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:45,875
YES, THAT WAS
CLEAR TO ME.

526
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:48,208
THEN PERHAPS
YOU WERE TOO ILL

527
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,917
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
"CAN'T GET BACK" MEANS.

528
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:53,959
I DON'T BELIEVE IT,
SPOCK.

529
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:58,000
IT'S JUST NOT LIKE YOU
TO GIVE UP TRYING.

530
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,041
THEN I'LL
REPEAT IT FOR YOU.

531
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,000
GET THIS
THROUGH YOUR HEAD--

532
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,125
WE CAN'T GET BACK.

533
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,041
THAT MEANS WE ARE TRAPPED

534
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:09,125
HERE IN THIS PLANET'S PAST

535
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,000
JUST AS WE ARE,

536
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,875
AND WE'LL STAY HERE
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

537
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:16,417
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

538
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,834
YES, I UNDERSTAND.

539
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:24,208
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D HEAR IT,

540
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,208
BUT I UNDERSTAND.

541
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:29,166
YOU WANT TO STAY HERE.

542
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,875
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
YOU ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED

543
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:35,417
TO STAY IN THIS
FORSAKEN WASTE!

544
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:38,875
PROSPECT APPEARED
QUITE ATTRACTIVE
TO YOU A MOMENT AGO.

545
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:42,333
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME,
YOU POINTED-EARED
VULCAN!

546
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:45,333
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

547
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:48,041
I DON'T THINK I EVER DID,
AND NOW I'M SURE.

548
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:52,834
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO YOU, SPOCK?

549
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:56,333
NOTHING THAT SHOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED LONG AGO.

550
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:20,041
LONG AGO.

551
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,583
OF COURSE.

552
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,417
LONG AGO.

553
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:41,000
THIS IS WHERE IT IS.

554
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,041
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE EXACT SPOT.

555
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,125
THAT'S IT!

556
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:08,959
THAT IS THE PORTAL.

557
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,875
I CANNOT WAIT
ANY LONGER.

558
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:45,250
SPOCK! MCCOY!

559
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,000
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>
COME IN.

560
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,417
SCOTTY:
SCOTT HERE, CAPTAIN.

561
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:49,917
HOW MUCH TIME BEFORE
THE SUN BLOWS UP?

562
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:52,709
17 MINUTES.
YOU THREE HAD BETTER
COME BACK RIGHT AWAY.

563
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:55,417
WE CAN'T, SCOTTY.
SPOCK AND MCCOY
ARE MISSING.

564
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:58,417
I KNEW THERE WAS TROUBLE.
I GOT A LANDING PARTY
STANDING BY.

565
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:00,500
NO! UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES SEND

566
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,917
ANYONE ELSE DOWN HERE
WITHOUT MY ORDERS.

567
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:03,917
PREPARE TO WARP OUT
AND STAND BY.

568
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:06,917
KIRK OUT.

569
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,917
MR. ATOZ!

570
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:12,083
WHERE ARE YOU?

571
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:16,417
MR. ATOZ:
MAY I HELP YOU?

572
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,834
IT'S YOU!
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU FOUND
YOUR WAY BACK HERE.

573
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:20,917
NOW LET ME PROCESS YOU
THROUGH THE ATAV--

574
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:22,834
NO.

575
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:26,458
MR. ATOZ, MY FRIENDS AND I
ARE FROM ANOTHER PLANET.

576
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,500
WE DON'T BELONG
IN YOUR HISTORY.

577
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,333
WE DON'T BELONG
ON YOUR PLANET AT ALL.

578
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,291
JUST LET ME
TAKE CARE OF<i> YOU</i>

579
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:33,709
AND GET YOU BACK
WHERE YOU BELONG.

580
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:34,834
NO.

581
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:38,917
I'M GOING TO FIND
THE EXACT DISK THAT
THEY WERE VIEWING.

582
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,917
PLEASE! GO BACK!

583
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:43,000
I'M SORRY, MR. ATOZ.
MR. ATOZ!

584
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,417
I MUST PREPARE
TO ESCAPE!

585
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,959
I'LL LET YOU OUT
IN A MINUTE.

586
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:50,917
STILL UP TO YOUR
LITTLE GAME OF REPLICAS?

587
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:54,125
WHICH ARE YOU THIS TIME,
REAL OR NOT?

588
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:02,500
YOU ARE EVIDENTLY
A SUICIDAL MANIAC.

589
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,208
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO,

590
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:06,417
BUT IF YOU CONTINUE,
BOTH OF US WILL DIE,

591
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:08,875
AND I, FOR ONE,
DO NOT WISH DEATH.

592
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,250
IF YOU HELP ME,
WE WON'T DIE.
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

593
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,417
I DON'T TRUST YOU.

594
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:13,125
WHICH ONE ARE YOU NOW,

595
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,583
THE REPLICA
OR THE REAL ONE?

596
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,000
I'M THE REAL ATOZ.

597
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,333
YOU'VE DONE AWAY
WITH MY REPLICAS.

598
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:22,542
I REGRET
WHAT I MUST NOW DO.

599
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:24,500
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT
TO HURT ME, DO YOU?

600
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,667
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE
MY LIFE. I REALIZE THAT.

601
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,709
PUT THAT THING AWAY.

602
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,583
UNH!

603
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,041
I CANNOT PRETEND TO BE
SORRY THAT YOU ARE HERE,

604
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:48,083
THOUGH I REALIZE IT IS
A MISFORTUNE FOR YOU.

605
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:51,125
I'M HERE AGAINST MY WILL,
TOO, JUST AS YOU ARE.

606
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,083
I'M SORRY.

607
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:57,083
I KNOW OF NO WAY
TO RETURN YOU

608
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,250
TO YOUR OWN TIME.

609
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,041
IT'S NOT THAT
I WISH TO RETURN.

610
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:04,083
THIS IS MY TIME NOW.

611
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,125
I'VE HAD TO FACE THAT.

612
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:09,000
BUT IT HAS BEEN
LONELY HERE.

613
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,208
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE ALONE...

614
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:14,750
REALLY ALONE?

615
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,333
YES...

616
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,125
I KNOW
WHAT IT IS LIKE.

617
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:22,792
I BELIEVE YOU DO.

618
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:29,500
HAVE SOMETHING
TO EAT, PLEASE.

619
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,583
IF IT PLEASES YOU.

620
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:42,000
THIS IS
ANIMAL FLESH.

621
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,709
THERE'S NOT MUCH ELSE
TO EAT AROUND HERE,
I'M AFRAID.

622
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:50,125
NATURALLY, BECAUSE
OF THE CLIMATE.

623
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:53,125
WHAT IS
THE SOURCE OF HEAT
IN THIS SHELTER?

624
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,250
THERE'S AN UNDERGROUND
HOT SPRING.

625
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,458
EXCELLENT.

626
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:58,083
THEN IT WILL BE
POSSIBLE TO BUILD

627
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:02,250
A GREENHOUSE
OF SORTS.

628
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,667
MEANWHILE...

629
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:09,125
THIS WILL HAVE TO DO
AS THE ONLY SOURCE
OF NOURISHMENT.

630
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,417
THERE AREN'T
MANY LUXURIES AROUND HERE.

631
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:32,959
ZORCON ONLY LEFT ME
WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO SURVIVE.

632
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:36,125
BUT HE EVIDENTLY
INTENDED THAT YOU
CONTINUE LIVING.

633
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:38,083
YES.

634
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:42,208
HE GAVE ME WEAPONS,
A SHELTER, FOOD,

635
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:44,792
EVERYTHING
I NEEDED TO LIVE...

636
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:47,375
EXCEPT COMPANIONSHIP.

637
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:51,458
HE DID NOT WANT IT SAID
THAT HE HAD ME KILLED,

638
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:54,417
BUT TO SEND ME HERE ALONE--

639
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:57,125
IF THAT IS NOT DEATH,
WHAT IS?

640
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,625
A VERY INVENTIVE MIND,
THAT MAN.

641
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,959
BUT INSENSITIVE...

642
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:08,417
TO SEND SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
INTO EXILE.

643
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:14,125
THE COLD MUST HAVE
AFFECTED ME MORE
THAN I REALIZED.

644
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:18,333
PLEASE PAY
NO ATTENTION.
I'M NOT MYSELF.

645
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,291
I'M BEHAVING
DISGRACEFULLY.

646
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:24,125
I HAVE EATEN
ANIMAL FLESH,
AND I'VE ENJOYED IT.

647
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:28,083
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH ME?

648
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:31,834
I TELL YOU
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

649
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,834
BUT YOU
<i>ARE</i> BEAUTIFUL.

650
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:42,417
IS IT SO WRONG
TO TELL YOU SO?

651
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:45,834
I HAVE LONGED
TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.

652
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:36,291
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL...

653
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:41,333
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN
ANY DREAM OF BEAUTY
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

654
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:56,250
JUST STAY
WHERE YOU ARE, SIR.
I'LL SEE YOU GET TO SAFETY.

655
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,417
NOW...

656
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:17,208
YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME
LOOK FOR MY FRIENDS.

657
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,333
YOU'RE A MOST
DETERMINED MAN.

658
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,667
[BEEP BEEP]

659
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,625
KIRK HERE.

660
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,375
SCOTTY:
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHY ARE YOU WAITING?

661
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:29,041
NO TIME TO EXPLAIN.
ARE YOU READY
TO WARP OUT?

662
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,750
AYE, CAPTAIN.

663
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,417
STAND BY
TO BEAM US UP,

664
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:36,041
BUT WHEN
THAT STAR EXPLODES,
DON'T WAIT.

665
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:38,166
GET OUT FAST.
KIRK OUT.

666
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:41,458
NOW WE'RE GOING
TO START LOOKING.

667
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:44,458
THEY WERE
IN A FROZEN WASTE.
I COULD HEAR THE WIND.

668
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:47,959
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

669
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:50,542
IT MUST BE
THE SARPEIDON
ICE AGE,

670
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:53,375
5,000 YEARS AGO.
LET ME LOOK.

671
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:57,417
WE'LL BOTH LOOK,
MR. ATOZ.

672
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,166
SPOCK.

673
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:08,250
YOU'VE BEEN DISHONEST
WITH ME, SPOCK,

674
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,709
AND THAT IS ALSO
SOMETHING NEW FOR YOU.

675
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:12,542
I'VE GIVEN YOU
THE FACTS, DOCTOR.

676
00:42:12,542 --> 00:42:15,208
THE FACTS
AS<i> YOU</i> KNOW THEM.

677
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:18,208
OR DID YOU JUST ACCEPT
ZARABETH'S WORD

678
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:20,667
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT
YOU WANTED TO BELIEVE?

679
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:22,166
YOU WERE TOLD
THE TRUTH.

680
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,166
IF ZARABETH
IS THE SOURCE,

681
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,709
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

682
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,166
ZARABETH IS A WOMAN

683
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,458
CONDEMNED TO A TERRIBLE
LIFE OF LONELINESS.

684
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:32,667
SHE WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO ANYBODY
TO CHANGE THAT.

685
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:34,166
WOULDN'T YOU, ZARABETH?

686
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,834
I TOLD YOU
WHAT I KNOW.

687
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:39,834
DID YOU? YOU SAID
<i>WE</i> CAN'T GET BACK.

688
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:42,083
THE TRUTH IS
<i>YOU</i> CAN'T GET BACK.

689
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,959
SHE WOULD NOT
JEOPARDIZE OTHER LIVES.

690
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:48,750
SHE WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO PREVENT THAT LIFE
OF LONELINESS!

691
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,083
SHE WOULD LIE.
SHE WOULD CHEAT.

692
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:52,959
SHE WOULD EVEN
MURDER ME, THE CAPTAIN,

693
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:55,291
THE ENTIRE CREW
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

694
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:59,041
TO KEEP YOU HERE
WITH HER.

695
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:02,375
GO AHEAD, ZARABETH.

696
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,083
TELL SPOCK THE TRUTH.

697
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:07,291
GO AHEAD.

698
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:09,125
TELL SPOCK
YOU WOULD KILL--

699
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:12,166
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TO HER?!
NO! DON'T TOUCH ME!

700
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:18,208
ARE YOU TRYING
TO KILL ME, SPOCK?

701
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:24,667
IS THAT WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT?

702
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,542
THINK.

703
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:28,041
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?

704
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,166
RAGE? JEALOUSY?

705
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:33,333
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
THOSE FEELINGS BEFORE?

706
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:37,041
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

707
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,834
IMPOSSIBLE.

708
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,417
I AM A VULCAN.

709
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:44,375
THE VULCAN YOU KNEW
WON'T EXIST

710
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:47,000
FOR ANOTHER
5,000 YEARS.

711
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
THINK, MAN!

712
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,041
WHAT'S HAPPENING
ON YOUR PLANET
RIGHT NOW,

713
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:53,458
AT THIS VERY MOMENT?

714
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:57,041
MY ANCESTORS
ARE BARBARIANS...

715
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:58,166
WARLIKE BARBARIANS.

716
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:00,166
WHO NEARLY KILLED
THEMSELVES OFF

717
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:03,500
WITH THEIR
OWN PASSIONS.

718
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,083
SPOCK...

719
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:08,166
YOU'RE REVERTING
INTO YOUR ANCESTORS,

720
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:13,333
5,000 YEARS BEFORE
YOU WERE BORN!

721
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:18,333
I'VE LOST MYSELF.

722
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:23,333
I DO NOT KNOW WHO I AM.

723
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:43,834
<i>CAN</i> WE GO BACK?

724
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:49,333
I DON'T KNOW.

725
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:54,709
I ONLY KNOW
THAT I CAN'T GO BACK.

726
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,417
I KNOW I'M GOING
TO TRY, SPOCK,

727
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:02,500
BECAUSE MY LIFE
IS BACK THERE...

728
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,583
AND I WANT THAT LIFE.

729
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:39,667
MR. ATOZ: YOU THINK
THAT'S THE RIGHT ONE?
KIRK: I DON'T KNOW.

730
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:42,166
IF WE'RE TO GET
THE PORTAL SET FOR
THE PROPER TIME PERIOD,

731
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:44,333
YOU MUST BE SPECIFIC.
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

732
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,333
WELL, TRY CALLING OUT.

733
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:48,166
BONES!

734
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,542
SPOCK!

735
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:52,542
MCCOY!

736
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:55,083
YOU'VE GOT
THE WRONG ONE.

737
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,000
PLEASE,
THERE'S NO TIME LEFT.

738
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,709
LET ME GO.
TRY AGAIN.

739
00:46:03,959 --> 00:46:07,166
THERE'S NO PORTAL HERE,
DOCTOR. IT'S HOPELESS.

740
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:09,041
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

741
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:12,250
YOU'RE TOO ILL
TO REMAIN OUT HERE
ANY LONGER. GIVE IT UP.

742
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,583
BONES!

743
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:24,166
SPOCK!

744
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:27,166
IT'S JIM!
HERE WE ARE, JIM!

745
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:29,125
WE FOUND THEM.

746
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:31,083
CAN YOU STILL
HEAR ME?

747
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:33,500
SPOCK: WE HEAR YOU
PERFECTLY, CAPTAIN.

748
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:37,083
FOLLOW MY VOICE!

749
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:39,083
SPOCK, MCCOY,
FOLLOW MY VOICE.

750
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:42,458
DO YOU HEAR ME?
KEEP FOLLOWING MY VOICE.

751
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:44,125
SPOCK, MCCOY.

752
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,041
THIS MUST BE IT.

753
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:48,166
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?
HURRY!

754
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:57,208
COME ON, SPOCK!

755
00:46:58,166 --> 00:47:00,709
YOU START AHEAD,
DOCTOR.

756
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:05,417
I DO NOT WISH
TO PART FROM YOU.

757
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:07,083
I CANNOT COME.

758
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:11,417
IF I GO BACK,
I WILL DIE.

759
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:13,417
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR? HURRY!

760
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:16,125
HOW MUCH TIME
DO WE HAVE?

761
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,583
SCOTTY, HOW MUCH TIME
IS THERE?

762
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:21,625
SCOTTY:
YOU'VE GOT TO
COME ABOARD NOW.

763
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:25,333
COME ON,
SPOCK! NOW!

764
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:37,542
SOMETHING'S WRONG!

765
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:41,959
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHY CAN'T HE GET THROUGH?
I DON'T KNOW,

766
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:46,166
UNLESS IT'S BECAUSE THEY
ORIGINALLY WENT THROUGH
THE PORTAL TOGETHER.

767
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,375
SPOCK! MCCOY!

768
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:51,083
YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH
UNLESS YOU BOTH COME
BACK AT THE SAME TIME!

769
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:52,917
SCOTTY--
SCOTTY: ORDERS OR NO,

770
00:47:52,917 --> 00:47:56,000
I'M BEAMING YOU
UP FIRST.
NO! WAIT!

771
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,208
KIRK: SPOCK! MCCOY!
HURRY THROUGH THE PORTAL!
TIME IS RUNNING OUT!

772
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:44,417
HE HAD HIS ESCAPE PLANNED.
I'M GLAD HE MADE IT.

773
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,750
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

774
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:54,208
THERE'S NO FURTHER NEED
TO OBSERVE ME, DOCTOR.

775
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:58,250
AS YOU CAN SEE, I'VE
RETURNED TO THE PRESENT
IN EVERY SENSE.

776
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,709
BUT IT DID HAPPEN,
SPOCK.

777
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:03,625
YES, IT HAPPENED...

778
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:06,667
BUT THAT WAS
5,000 YEARS AGO,

779
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:09,291
AND SHE IS DEAD NOW,

780
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:11,792
DEAD AND BURIED...

781
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:13,709
LONG AGO.

782
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:14,709
SCOTTY,
ARE YOU THERE?

783
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:16,458
SCOTTY: IT'S
NOW OR NEVER,
CAPTAIN.

784
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:16,875
BEAM US ABOARD,

785
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:21,458
AND GO TO MAXIMUM WARP
AS SOON AS WE'RE THERE.
KIRK OUT.
