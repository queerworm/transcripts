1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,463
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 3211.7.

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:05,965
WE ARE ENTERING
STANDARD ORBIT

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,174
ABOUT GAMMA 2,

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,259
AN UNINHABITED
PLANETOID

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,094
WITH AN AUTOMATIC
COMMUNICATIONS

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,597
AND ASTROGATION STATION.

7
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,640
ENSIGN CHEKOV,

8
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:15,975
LIEUTENANT UHURA, AND I

9
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,518
WILL BEAM DOWN

10
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,270
AND MAKE A ROUTINE CHECK
OF ITS FACILITIES.

11
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,730
STANDARD ORBIT,
CAPTAIN.

12
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,440
GOOD.

13
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,694
MIND THE STORE,
MR. SPOCK.

14
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:27,361
ACKNOWLEDGED,
CAPTAIN.

15
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,821
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
LET'S GO.

16
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,030
YES, SIR.

17
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,039
ENERGIZE, SCOTTY.

18
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,833
AYE, CAPTAIN.

19
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,677
CAPTAIN...

20
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,679
WHAT HAPPENED?

21
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,263
MUST BE A...

22
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,224
TRANSPORTER
MALFUNCTION.

23
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:01,061
IT...WAS
A ROUGH TRIP.

24
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,397
THIS ISN'T GAMMA 2.

25
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,649
LOOK AT THE COLOR
OF THAT SKY.

26
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,193
THIS IS THE CRAZIEST
LANDING PAD
I'VE EVER SEEN.

27
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,987
THAT'S A TRINARY SUN.

28
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,615
SCOTT TO BRIDGE.

29
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,241
SPOCK HERE.

30
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,785
MR. SPOCK,
THE CAPTAIN,

31
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,829
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
AND CHEKOV...

32
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,288
THEY VANISHED.

33
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,624
THEY GOT ONTO
THE TRANSPORTER PLATFORM

34
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,419
AND THEY JUST VANISHED.

35
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,379
I PRESUME YOU MEAN
THEY VANISHED IN A MANNER

36
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,172
NOT CONSISTENT
WITH THE USUAL WORKINGS

37
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,008
OF THE TRANSPORTER,
MR. SCOTT.

38
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,509
AYE, OF COURSE
I MEAN THAT.

39
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,261
YOU THINK I'D CALL YOU
IF THEY JUST BEAMED DOWN?

40
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,263
HAVE YOU REVERSED CONTROLS?

41
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,224
I'VE MADE ALL
THE PROPER CHECKS.
THERE WAS NOTHING.

42
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,643
THERE WAS NO FLASH
OF LIGHT, NOTHING.

43
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,102
THEY WERE GONE.

44
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,187
POWER SURGE?

45
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,564
NOT DOWN HERE.

46
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,857
ALL THE DIALS WERE RIGHT

47
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,525
AND THE TRANSPORTER
WAS FUNCTIONING PERFECTLY.

48
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,569
RECHECK YOUR EQUIPMENT,
MR. SCOTT.

49
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,196
I'LL SCAN FOR THEM
ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE.

50
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,197
SPOCK OUT.

51
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,866
BUT, CAPTAIN,
IF WE'RE NOT
ON GAMMA 2,

52
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,911
THEN WHERE ARE WE?

53
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,788
THAT'S WHAT
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

54
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,497
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

55
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,959
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

56
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,379
DEAD.

57
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,507
MINE, TOO.

58
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,759
CAPTAIN...

59
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:14,635
LOOK.

60
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,554
PHASERS...ON STUN.

61
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,446
FIRE.

62
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,616
HAND-TO-HAND.

63
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,543
Kirk: SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

64
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,137
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

65
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,763
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--

66
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,141
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

67
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:48,187
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

68
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,231
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

69
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:37,277
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 3211.8.

70
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,320
WHILE BEAMING DOWN
FROM THE "ENTERPRISE"

71
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,823
TO INSPECT FACILITIES
ON GAMMA 2,

72
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,200
THE NORMAL
TRANSPORTER SEQUENCE

73
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,952
HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED,

74
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,079
AND WE FIND OURSELVES
ON A STRANGE

75
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,663
AND HOSTILE PLANET,

76
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,416
SURROUNDED BY CREATURES
BELONGING TO RACES

77
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,170
SCATTERED ALL THROUGH
THE GALAXY.

78
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,547
EXCELLENT,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

79
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,181
ALTHOUGH
WE EXPECTED STRENGTH

80
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,142
AND COMPETITIVE SPIRIT,

81
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,352
WE ARE GREATLY PLEASED.

82
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,980
EITHER OF YOU HURT?

83
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,856
I DON'T THINK
SO, CAPTAIN.

84
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,110
NOBODY'S HURT, CAPTAIN.
YET.

85
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:22,990
ADMIRABLE, CHEKOV.
ADMIRABLE.

86
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,575
YOU ALSO, UHURA.

87
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,288
YOUR SPIRIT
IS AS GREAT
AS THE CAPTAIN'S.

88
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,292
I CAN SEE
YOU WILL ALL PROVE
INVALUABLE HERE.

89
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,584
I AM GALT,

90
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,337
MASTER THRALL
OF THE PLANET
TRISKELION.

91
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,968
I HAVE BEEN SENT
TO WELCOME YOU.

92
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,349
THERE, CAPTAIN.

93
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,227
NOW YOU ARE PREPARED
FOR YOUR TRAINING.

94
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,353
HOW DO YOU KNOW
OUR NAMES?

95
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,982
THE PROVIDERS
WERE EXPECTING YOU,
CAPTAIN.

96
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,651
THEY ARRANGED
YOUR TRANSPORTATION.

97
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,653
THESE PROVIDERS
OF YOURS, ARE THEY--

98
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,362
CORRECTION, CAPTAIN.

99
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,948
THE PROVIDERS
ARE NOT OURS.

100
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,367
WE ARE THEIRS.

101
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,329
WHAT DO THEY WANT
FROM US?

102
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,248
YOU ARE TO BE TRAINED,
OF COURSE.

103
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,001
WHAT OTHER USE IS THERE
FOR THRALLS?

104
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,211
THRALLS?

105
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,379
YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.

106
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,884
WE'RE OFFICERS...

107
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,219
OF A UNITED SPACESHIP...

108
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,095
ON FEDERATION BUSINESS.

109
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,681
THERE HAS BEEN NO MISTAKE.

110
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,977
YOUR OLD TITLES
MEAN NOTHING HERE,
CAPTAIN.

111
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,603
YOU ARE THRALLS NOW.

112
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,732
YOU ARE TO BE TAKEN

113
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:39,816
TO THE TRAINING
ENCLOSURE.

114
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,776
[BUZZ]

115
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,072
COME.

116
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,615
PLACES HAVE BEEN
PREPARED FOR YOU.

117
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,663
WE'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE...

118
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,539
UNTIL WE HAVE
SOME INFORMATION.

119
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,749
WHO ARE YOU?

120
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,335
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

121
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,961
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO
DO WITH US?

122
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,548
I AM GALT,
THE MASTER THRALL.

123
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,134
THIS PLACE IS
THE PLANET TRISKELION.

124
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,719
YOU ARE TO BE TRAINED

125
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,264
AND SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR LIVES HERE.

126
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,365
MR. SPOCK...

127
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,117
I'VE CHECKED
THAT TRANSPORTER

128
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,326
FROM ONE END
TO THE OTHER.

129
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,453
EVERY CIRCUIT
WORKS PERFECTLY.

130
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,621
WHATEVER THAT
POWER SURGE WAS,

131
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,748
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE TRANSPORTER

132
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,959
OR WITH ANY OTHER
SYSTEM ABOARD THIS SHIP.

133
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,627
I'M BEGINNING
TO BELIEVE THAT,
MR. SCOTT.

134
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,255
I'VE CONDUCTED
TWO SWEEPS OF
THE PLANET'S SURFACE.

135
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,966
THERE IS NO
SIGN OF LIFE.

136
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,218
THEN WHAT THE DEVIL
IS HAPPENING?

137
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,177
DOES THAT MEAN
THEIR ATOMS

138
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,554
ARE JUST
FLOATING AROUND
OUT THERE?

139
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,014
NO, DOCTOR.
EVEN THAT

140
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,641
WOULD SHOW UP
ON OUR SENSORS.

141
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,351
WHERE ARE THEY THEN?

142
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,353
THE ONLY ANSWERS
ARE NEGATIVE.

143
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,479
NO MAGNETIC STORMS,

144
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,647
NO IONIC
INTERFERENCE,

145
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,025
NO BREAKDOWN
IN YOUR EQUIPMENT.

146
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,902
A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE
IS NO GOOD TO US.

147
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,489
WE CAN'T JUST
LEAVE THEM
OUT THERE,

148
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,949
WHEREVER THEY ARE.

149
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,160
WE SHALL CONTINUE
SENSOR SCANS, DOCTOR.

150
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,203
AT THE MOMENT,
THAT IS ALL WE CAN DO,

151
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,457
EXCEPT HOPE FOR
A RATIONAL EXPLANATION.

152
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,084
HOPE?

153
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,128
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS
A HUMAN FAILING,

154
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,004
MR. SPOCK.

155
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,880
TRUE, DOCTOR.

156
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,257
CONSTANT EXPOSURE

157
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,050
DOES RESULT IN
A CERTAIN DEGREE

158
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,635
OF CONTAMINATION.

159
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,893
THESE ARE YOUR QUARTERS.

160
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,645
OPEN, THRALLS.

161
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,116
AAH!

162
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,415
AAH!

163
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,000
AAH!

164
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,523
THAT WAS FOOLISH,
CAPTAIN.

165
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,275
ESCAPE IS
QUITE IMPOSSIBLE...

166
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,820
AS DEMONSTRATED
BY YOUR COLLARS
OF OBEDIENCE.

167
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,990
RETURN TO
YOUR QUARTERS.

168
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,943
THEY ARE NOT
WITHIN THE CONFINES
OF THIS SOLAR SYSTEM.

169
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,486
IT'S BEEN
NEARLY AN HOUR.

170
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,572
CAN PEOPLE
LIVE THAT LONG AS
DISASSEMBLED ATOMS

171
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,656
IN A TRANSPORTER
BEAM?

172
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,119
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF
THE STUDY BEING DONE,

173
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,829
BUT IT WOULD BE
A FASCINATING PROJECT.

174
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,790
FASCINATING?

175
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,292
THOSE PEOPLE ARE
FRIENDS OF OURS
OUT THERE,

176
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,334
IF THEY'RE STILL ALIVE.

177
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,085
PRECISELY.

178
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,628
THE ODDS ARE NOT GOOD.

179
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,922
NO. I WOULD SAY
APPROXIMATELY 400--

180
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,591
DON'T QUOTE ODDS
AND DON'T GIVE ME

181
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,968
ANY MORE DISPASSIONATE
LOGIC, MR. SPOCK.

182
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,177
JUST KEEP LOOKING
FOR THEM.

183
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,012
I WOULD WELCOME
A SUGGESTION, DOCTOR,

184
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,139
EVEN AN EMOTIONAL ONE,

185
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,600
AS TO WHERE TO LOOK.

186
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,148
FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER
ASKED ME FOR ANYTHING,

187
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,442
AND IT HAS TO BE
AN OCCASION LIKE THIS.

188
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,115
Chekov: CAPTAIN,
THE ENTERPRISE.

189
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,909
THEY WILL BE TRYING
TO FIND US, WON'T THEY?

190
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,662
THEY'LL TRY, BUT WHERE
DO THEY LOOK?

191
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,998
WE'RE HERE, AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE IT IS.

192
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,959
THIS SYSTEM'S STAR
IS A TRINARY.

193
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,461
LIMITS IT A BIT,
BUT WE'RE A LONG WAY

194
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,879
FROM THE "ENTERPRISE,"

195
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,798
IF WE'RE EVEN
IN THE SAME DIMENSION.

196
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,934
I AM YOUR
DRILL THRALL.

197
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,645
I AM CALLED LARS.

198
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,770
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM HER?

199
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,357
THAT IS NOT
YOUR CONCERN.

200
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,567
YOUR DRILL THRALLS WILL
ATTEND YOU PRESENTLY.

201
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,405
THERE IS LITTLE TIME.

202
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,035
Uhura:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

203
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,539
AAH! AAH!
GET OUT!

204
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,124
I HAVE BEEN
SELECTED FOR YOU.

205
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,001
LIEUTENANT,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

206
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,253
[STRUGGLING]

207
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,921
AAH!

208
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,340
LIEUTENANT!

209
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,925
LIEUTENANT, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

210
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,260
LIEUTENANT,
ANSWER ME!

211
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,970
AAH!

212
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,389
LIEUTENANT!

213
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,391
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO LIEUTENANT UHURA?!

214
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,440
LIEUTENANT,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

215
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,611
IT IS NOT ALLOWED
TO REFUSE SELECTION.

216
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,447
[BEEP]

217
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,663
STEP AWAY
FROM THE DOOR.

218
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,583
[BEEP]

219
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,544
COME.

220
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,212
IT IS THE NOURISHMENT
INTERVAL.

221
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,646
CAPTAIN'S LOG,

222
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,691
STARDATE 3259.2.

223
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,444
FIRST OFFICER SPOCK
IN COMMAND.

224
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,613
THE CAPTAIN,
LIEUTENANT UHURA,

225
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,239
AND ENSIGN CHEKOV

226
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,866
HAVE BEEN MISSING
FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS.

227
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,619
COMPUTER
PROBABILITY PROJECTIONS

228
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,827
ARE USELESS

229
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,787
DUE TO INSUFFICIENT DATA.

230
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,165
MR. SPOCK, I'M GETTING
A FLUCTUATING ENERGY READING

231
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,667
ON THIS HYDROGEN CLOUD.

232
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:16,963
IT'S FAINT, SIR,

233
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,548
BUT IT CONSISTENTLY
READS IN EXCESS

234
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,967
OF PREDICTABLE
ENERGY LEVEL.

235
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,428
INTERESTING.

236
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,640
THERE SEEMS TO BE
AN IONIZATION TRAIL.

237
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:27,974
WHAT WOULD ACCOUNT
FOR THAT, SPOCK?

238
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,936
EXACTLY THE QUESTION
I HAVE JUST FED TO
THE COMPUTERS, DOCTOR.

239
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,521
AND THE ANSWER IS...

240
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,610
NOTHING KNOWN TO US
WOULD ACCOUNT FOR IT.

241
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,861
WELL, THE TRANSPORTER
HAS NEITHER THE POWER

242
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,530
NOR THE RANGE
TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT.

243
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,409
PLOT A FOLLOW COURSE,
ENSIGN HAINES.

244
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,035
AYE, SIR.

245
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,705
YOU'RE GOING
TO LEAVE HERE
WITHOUT THEM

246
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,332
AND RUN OFF ON SOME
WILD GOOSE CHASE

247
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,334
HALFWAY ACROSS
THE GALAXY

248
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,919
JUST BECAUSE
YOU FOUND A DISCREPANCY
IN A HYDROGEN CLOUD?

249
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,505
DOCTOR,
I AM CHASING THE CAPTAIN,

250
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,881
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
AND ENSIGN CHEKOV,

251
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,425
NOT SOME WILD
AQUATIC FOWL.

252
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,885
THIS IS THE ONLY LEAD
WE'VE HAD.

253
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,680
COURSE PLOTTED
AND LAID IN,
MR. SPOCK.

254
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,431
310 MARK 241.

255
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,600
INITIATE.
WARP FACTOR 2.

256
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,748
YOU, YOU HAVE BEEN
SELECTED FOR ME?

257
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,460
[DEEP VOICE] NO. I AM
ONLY YOUR DRILL THRALL.

258
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,713
I HAVE
BROUGHT YOU NOURISHMENT.

259
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,217
IT IS A NICE NAME,
CHEE-KOO.

260
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,804
HEH HEH.
CHEKOV.

261
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,348
CHEE-KOOF!

262
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,851
IT IS A VERY NICE NAME.

263
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,562
I AM CALLED TAMOON.

264
00:14:55,687 --> 00:15:01,234
OH, PLEASED, PLEASED
TO KNOW YOU, MISS.

265
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,406
YOU ARE A FINE SPECIMEN.

266
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,533
I LIKE YOU BETTER
THAN THE OTHERS.

267
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,329
I WILL
INSTRUCT YOU WELL,

268
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,875
SO MY PROVIDER
WILL TAKE YOU.

269
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,961
THAT'S V-V-VERY KIND
OF YOU, MISS, BUT--

270
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,339
IF MY PROVIDER
IS PLEASED,

271
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,260
WE MAY EVEN BE SELECTED
FOR EACH OTHER.

272
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,893
I DIDN'T REALIZE
I WAS SO HUNGRY.

273
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,436
WHATEVER YOU CALL THIS,
IT WAS VERY GOOD.

274
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,856
IT IS NOURISHMENT.
WE CALL IT THAT.

275
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,024
NOURISHMENT.
THAT'S VERY PRACTICAL.

276
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,651
WHAT DO YOU CALL
THIS COLLAR?

277
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,695
IT IS A SIGN
OF OUR PROVIDER.

278
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,615
BY THE COLOR OF THE LIGHTS,
IT CAN BE KNOWN WHO HOLDS US.

279
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,283
WHEN YOU ARE VENDED,
YOU WILL ALSO
HAVE A COLOR.

280
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:54,995
VENDED? YOU MEAN
BOUGHT, SOLD.

281
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,331
WHEN YOU ARE
DEVELOPED.

282
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,083
THE PROVIDER
WHO OFFERS
THE MOST QUATLOOS

283
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,335
PUTS HIS COLOR ON US.

284
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:05,089
OUR RACE HAS
ANOTHER NAME FOR IT.

285
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,299
SLAVERY.

286
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:12,138
THIS...
COLLAR OF OBEDIENCE...

287
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:19,687
IS GALT THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN OPERATE IT?

288
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,064
IT IS ONLY
TO WARN AND PUNISH.

289
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,357
HOW DOES HE WORK IT?

290
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,318
IT IS NOT PERMITTED
TO TALK OF THAT.

291
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,863
WILL YOU PROVIDE
ALL MY NOURISHMENT?

292
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,239
OF COURSE.

293
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,366
I AM YOUR DRILL THRALL.

294
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,619
I WILL TRAIN YOU WELL.

295
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,288
YES, I'M SURE YOU WILL.

296
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,665
I MUST SAY,

297
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,707
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A TOP SERGEANT

298
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,041
WHO LOOKED LIKE YOU.

299
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,710
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

300
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,797
IT MEANS YOU'RE
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

301
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,675
WHAT IS...BEAUTIFUL?

302
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,760
YOU MEAN NOBODY'S EVER
TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE?

303
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,180
WELL, UH,
BEAUTIFUL IS, UM...

304
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,975
BEAUTIFUL...

305
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,562
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

306
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,862
SHAHNA,
WHERE WERE YOU BORN?

307
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,115
BORN?

308
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,409
I HAVE BEEN HERE
ALWAYS.

309
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,620
YOUR PARENTS--
WHERE ARE THEY?

310
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,788
YOUR MOTHER
AND FATHER.

311
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,290
SHE WHO BORE ME WAS KILLED
IN A FREESTYLE MATCH.

312
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,249
FREESTYLE?

313
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,960
YOU WILL LEARN
ALL THESE THINGS.

314
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,756
LARS AND CHEKOV'S
DRILL THRALL.

315
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,967
THEY WEREN'T BORN HERE.
WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?

316
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,385
IT IS NOT PERMITTED--

317
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,975
THE EXERCISE INTERVAL.

318
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,227
THIS IS YOUR
TRAINING HARNESS.

319
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,436
PUT IT ON.

320
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,154
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

321
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,365
NOTHING OUT THERE.
NOTHING OUT THERE
AT ALL.

322
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,243
WE CERTAINLY SEEM
TO BE HEADING INTO
AN EMPTY SECTOR.

323
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,286
PROJECTING BACK
ALONG THE PATH
OF IONIZATION,

324
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,373
THE NEAREST SYSTEM
IS M24 ALPHA.

325
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,960
THAT MUST BE
TWO DOZEN LIGHT YEARS AWAY.

326
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,629
11.630.

327
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,172
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THAT THEY COULD HAVE
TRANSPORTED

328
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,760
OVER A DISTANCE OF...

329
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,429
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR
VULCAN MIND, SPOCK.

330
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,972
I'M SUGGESTING NOTHING,
DOCTOR.

331
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,559
I'M MERELY PURSUING
THE ONLY LOGICAL COURSE
AVAILABLE TO US.

332
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,146
HOLD.

333
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,488
THIS THRALL WAS SLOW
IN OBEYING A COMMAND.

334
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:38,910
FOR HIS PUNISHMENT,
HE WILL BE PRACTICE TARGET.

335
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,578
AS YOU CHARGE,

336
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,206
YOU WILL STRIKE
THE PRACTICE TARGET
WHEN YOU PASS.

337
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,583
YOU BEGIN, UHURA.

338
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,131
NO!

339
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,302
IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO REFUSE
A TRAINING EXERCISE.

340
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,345
I DON'T CARE WHETHER
IT'S ALLOWED OR NOT.

341
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,639
I WILL NOT DO IT.

342
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,181
NONE OF US
WILL DO IT, GALT.

343
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,183
IT IS PART OF YOUR TRAINING.

344
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,561
THE PROVIDERS WISH IT.

345
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,980
THE DEVIL WITH
THE PROVIDERS.

346
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,188
COSSACKS.

347
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,735
[CHOKING]

348
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,995
WE HAVE BEEN TOLERANT
BECAUSE YOU ARE NEWCOMERS,

349
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,831
BUT I SEE YOU MUST
BE GIVEN A LESSON.

350
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,040
LARS.

351
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,920
KLOOG.

352
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,547
KLOOG WILL ADMINISTER
CORRECTION.

353
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,886
UHURA, TAKE YOUR PLACE
ON THE TRIAD.

354
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,308

THE PROVIDERS.

359
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,694
IT IS NOT PERMITTED.

360
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:58,238
BUT, CAPTAIN,
SINCE YOU ASSUME
RESPONSIBILITY

361
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,365
FOR YOUR PEOPLE,

362
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,617

THE PUNISHMENT.

363
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,414

THAN THE COLLAR.

PRACTICE TARGET.

366

IT IS A SHAME
TO LOSE YOU, CAPTAIN,

367
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,600

AS AN EXAMPLE
TO THE OTHERS.

ITS LOCATION.

373

WE DO NOT KNOW
WHO CONTROLS IT.

374
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,636

2,000 QUATLOOS ARE BID.

393
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,813
IS THERE A CHALLENGE?

394
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,821
THE NEWCOMERS
HAVE BEEN VENDED
TO PROVIDER 1.

395
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,740
WE'RE FREE PEOPLE.

396
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,950
WE BELONG TO NO ONE.

397
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,743
SUCH SPIRIT.

398

399
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,707
20 QUATLOOS THAT
ALL 3 ARE UNTRAINABLE.

400

5,000 QUATLOOS
THAT THE NEWCOMERS

401
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,460

TO BE DESTROYED.

402
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,089
ACCEPTED.
MARK THEM, GALT.

403
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:44,275
YOU NOW BEAR THE MARK
OF A FINE HERD.

404
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,985
BUT I MUST WARN YOU--

405
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:51,324
ANY FURTHER DISOBEDIENCE
NOW THAT YOU ARE
FULL-FLEDGED THRALLS

406
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,575
WILL BE PUNISHABLE
BY DEATH.

407
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,876
MR. SPOCK, IT JUST
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

408
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:03,961
THEY COULD HAVE COME
THIS FAR.

409

ANY CHANCE AT ALL, IT'S
TO CONTINUE TO SEARCH

410
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,299
IN THE AREA THEY WERE LOST.

411
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,675
WE SEARCHED THE AREA.

412
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,802
IT'S ALWAYS POSSIBLE
TO MISS SOMETHING.

413
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,096

THE TRANSPORTER MECHANISM.

414

NO, SIR.
THERE WAS NO SIGN
OF FAILURE.

THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THEM
IN THE AREA OF GAMMA 2.

416
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,479
IF THEY WEREN'T
THERE, IT'S
JUST RIDICULOUS

417
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,356
TO THINK THEY COULD
STILL BE ALIVE,

418
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,731
NOT AFTER
ALL THIS TIME.

419
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,484
IN THAT CASE, DOCTOR,

OVER 2 MILES.

00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,375

425
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,583

00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:47,129
OH. VERY WELL.

THAT IS THE WAY.

THEIR VOICES SOUND...
MECHANICAL.

436
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,032
ARE THEY COMPUTERS?

437
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,325

COULD IT
HAVE BEEN A CITY
FOR THE PROVIDERS?

I DO NOT THINK
IT IS WELL
TO ASK SUCH THINGS.

447
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:57,824

I DID NOT KNOW
IT COULD BE LIKE THIS

535
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,157
BETWEEN PEOPLE.

536
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:53,620
IS IT ALWAYS SO IN
THE PLACE YOU COME FROM?

537
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,581
CAPTAIN,

538
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:59,585
YOU DO INDEED
PRESENT MANY
SURPRISES.

539
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,255
BECAUSE
YOU HAVE AMUSED
THE PROVIDERS,

540
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,965
THERE WILL BE
NO PUNISHMENT.

541
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,301
RETURN TO
YOUR QUARTERS.

542
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,248
MR. SCOTT,

543
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,793
CAN WE MANAGE
ANYTHING FASTER
THAN WARP 6?

544
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:41,543
IT'S MY OPINION

545
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,004
THAT WE'VE GONE TOO FAR
AS IT IS, SIR.

546
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,006
HE'S RIGHT, SPOCK.

547
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,217
WE'VE LOST JIM
AND THE OTHERS
BACK ON GAMMA 2.

548
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,510
NOW YOU'VE
DRAGGED US OUT HERE

549
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,805
A DOZEN LIGHT YEARS
ON SOME WILD HUNCH--

550
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,974
DOCTOR, I DO NOT RESPOND
TO HUNCHES.

551
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,227
NO TRANSPORTER MALFUNCTION
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DISAPPEARANCE.

552
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,729
THEY WERE NOT WITHIN
THE GAMMA SYSTEM.

553
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:04,775
A FOCUSED BEAM
OF EXTREMELY
HIGH-INTENSITY LIGHT

554
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,944
WAS DIRECTED INTO
THE GAMMA SYSTEM

555
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,655
FROM THE TRINARY SYSTEM
WE ARE NOW APPROACHING.

556
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,364
NO KNOWN
NATURAL PHENOMENA

557
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,200
COULD HAVE CAUSED
THAT BEAM.

558
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,953
DOES THAT CLARIFY
THE SITUATION?

559
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,871
NO, IT DOESN'T,
MR. SPOCK.

560
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,247
IT'S STILL
A FANCY WAY
OF SAYING

561
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,707
THAT YOU'RE PLAYING
A HUNCH.

562
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,918
WELL, MY HUNCH IS
THAT THEY'RE BACK
ON GAMMA 2,

563
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,419
DEAD OR ALIVE,

564
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,713
AND I STILL WANT
ANOTHER SEARCH.

565
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:31,176
DR. McCOY SPEAKS
FOR ME, TOO, SIR.

566
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,552
I SEE.

567
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,186
GENTLEMEN,

568
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,938
I AM IN COMMAND
OF THIS VESSEL,

569
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,024
AND WE SHALL CONTINUE
ON OUR PRESENT COURSE,

570
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:50,403
UNLESS IT IS
YOUR INTENTION
TO DECLARE A MUTINY.

571
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,947
MR. SPOCK.

572
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,615
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A MUTINY,

573
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,408
YOU STUBBORN,
POINTED-EARED...

574
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,079
ALL RIGHT.

575
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,457
IF WE DON'T
FIND THEM HERE,

576
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,960
DO WE STILL HAVE
ANOTHER SEARCH
ON GAMMA 2?

577
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:05,878
AGREED.

578
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:09,589
MR. SCOTT,
COULD YOU MANAGE WARP 7?

579
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,925
I WOULD BE MORE THAN
CONTENT TO DO SO, SIR,

580
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,511
AND MAYBE A WEE BIT MORE.

581
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:15,804
ENSIGN...

582
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,806
WARP 7.

583
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,826
YOU'RE DISTURBED ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

584
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,036
YES.

585
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,956
YOU HAVE MADE ME FEEL...

586
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,458
STRANGELY.

587
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,919
IF IT WERE ALLOWED,
I WOULD ASK THAT

588
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:49,671
YOU HAVE ANOTHER
DRILL THRALL.

589
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,673
I WOULDN'T LIKE THAT,
SHAHNA.

590
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,512
I WOULDN'T LIKE THAT
AT ALL.

591
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,119
I'M SORRY, SHAHNA.

592
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,339
[BEEPS]

593
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,345
THIS IS GOING TO KILL
OUR ROMANCE.

594
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,102
WHAT ABOUT LARS?

595
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,853
HE'S GONE
TO REPORT ME.

596
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,146
I TOLD HIM
I DIDN'T LIKE THE FOOD.

597
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,355
I THINK GALT
IS THE ONLY ONE

598
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,190
WHO CONTROLS
THESE COLLARS.

599
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,150
IF WE CAN FIND
THE PHASER

600
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,735
THAT I THREW
AT LARS,

601
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,945
WE CAN USE
THE CIRCUITS

602
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,738
TO SHORT OUT
THESE COLLARS.

603
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,572
CAPTAIN.

604
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,474
Provider:
ONLY A REMINDER.

605
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,351
YOU EARTH PEOPLE
ARE MOST UNUSUAL,

606
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,853
MOST STIMULATING.

607
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,195
STANDARD ORBIT.

608
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,825
SENSORS INDICATE
ONLY ONE CONCENTRATION

609
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,160
OF LIFE FORMS
ON THE PLANET--

610
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,037
ON THE LOWER HEMISPHERE.

611
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,163
HUMANOID READINGS.

612
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,664
WELL, AT LEAST
THAT GIVES

613
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,248
OUR LANDING FORCE
A STARTING POINT.

614
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,668
THERE WILL BE
NO LANDING FORCE, DOCTOR.

615
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,838
ASSUMING THE CAPTAIN
AND THE OTHERS
ARE STILL ALIVE,

616
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,756
IT WOULD BE UNWISE
TO ENDANGER THEM

617
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,467
BY BEAMING DOWN
A LARGE CONTINGENT.

618
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,011
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO LEAVE THEM THERE

619
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,846
WHILE WE JUST SIT
AND WAIT.

620
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,936
INTERESTING.

621
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,980
NO POWER SOURCE.

622
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,982
IT MAY BE SHIELDED.

623
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,692
AND IT MAY BE JUST
A WILD GOOSE CHASE

624
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,194
LIKE WE'VE BEEN
TELLING YOU.

625
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,445
I SHALL BEAM DOWN,
DOCTOR.

626
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,031
IF I'M UNABLE
TO COMMUNICATE,

627
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:24,076
A LANDING PARTY
MAY BE NECESSARY.

628
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,369
WELL, MR. SPOCK,
IF YOU'RE GOING
INTO THE LION'S DEN,

629
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,330
YOU'LL NEED
A MEDICAL OFFICER.

630
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,040
DANIEL, AS I RECALL,

631
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,291
HAD ONLY HIS FAITH.

632
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,795
BUT I WELCOME
YOUR COMPANY, DOCTOR.

633
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,296
MR. SCOTT,
YOU'LL BE IN COMMAND.

634
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,506
AYE, SIR.

635
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,140
Provider:
NO, MR. SPOCK,

636
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,017
YOU WILL NOT
LEAVE THE SHIP.

637
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:52,562
NONE OF YOUR
CONTROL SYSTEMS
WILL OPERATE.

638
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,522
McCoy: WHAT THE DEVIL'S
GOING ON?

639
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,857
SPOCK?

640
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,901
SPOCK!

641
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,652
Kirk: SPOCK!

642
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,197
WELCOME TO TRISKELION,
GENTLEMEN.

643
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,241
BY NOW
IT MUST BE OBVIOUS TO YOU

644
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,367
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN EXPECTED.

645
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,327
WHAT THE VOICE SAID
WAS TRUE, SIR.

646
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,412
NOTHING
IS FUNCTIONING.

647
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,539
Provider:
COMMENDATIONS, GENTLEMEN.

648
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,208
YOUR INGENUITY
IN DISCOVERING

649
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:16,044
THE WHEREABOUTS
OF YOUR COMPANIONS
IS NOTEWORTHY.

650
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,004
Kirk: WHAT YOU'RE
HEARING, GENTLEMEN,

651
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,257
IS A PROVIDER.

652
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,717
WE ARE KNOWN
TO THE THRALLS
AS PROVIDERS

653
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,886
BECAUSE WE PROVIDE
FOR ALL THEIR NEEDS.

654
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:25,762
THE TERM IS EASIER

655
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,974
FOR THEIR LIMITED
MENTAL ABILITIES
TO COMPREHEND.

656
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,308
"PROVIDING FOR
ALL THEIR NEEDS"

657
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,185
MEANS USING THRALLS--

658
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,188
PEOPLE STOLEN
FROM OTHER PARTS
OF THE GALAXY

659
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,731
TO FIGHT EACH OTHER,

660
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:40,526
AND THE PROVIDERS
GAMBLE ON THE WINNER.

661
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:41,861
FASCINATING.

662
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,447
BUT THESE...PROVIDERS

663
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,616
HAVEN'T THE COURAGE
TO SHOW THEMSELVES.

664
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,911
Provider: YOUR SPECIES HAS
GREAT CURIOSITY.

665
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,206
WE KNEW THAT.
YOU ARE INTERESTING
IN MANY WAYS.

666
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,874
BUT YOU ARE AFRAID?

667
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,376
Provider: YOU PRESENT NO DANGER
WHILE YOU WEAR THE COLLAR,

668
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,712
AND YOU WEAR IT
AS LONG AS YOU LIVE.

669
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,756
THEN SHOW YOURSELF.

670
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,216
Provider: THERE IS NO OBJECTION.

671
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,645
THE POWER SOURCE...

672
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,023
SHIELDED BY SOLID ROCK.

673
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:21,901
Provider 1:
WE ARE 1,000 OF YOUR METERS
BENEATH THE SURFACE.

674
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,945
PRIMARY...

675
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:28,116
MENTAL EVOLUTION.
INCREDIBLE.

676
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,784
Provider 2:
THAT IS NOT TRUE, CAPTAIN.

677
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,244
ONCE WE HAD
HUMANOID FORM,

678
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,788
BUT WE EVOLVED
BEYOND IT.

679
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,623
Provider 3: THROUGH EONS
OF DEVOTING OURSELVES

680
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,917
EXCLUSIVELY TO
INTELLECTUAL PURSUITS,

681
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,711
WE BECAME
THE PHYSICALLY SIMPLE,

682
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,462
MENTALLY SUPERIOR
CREATURE

683
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,964
YOU SEE BEFORE YOU.

684
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:49,221
A SPECIES THAT ENSLAVES
OTHER BEINGS

685
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:50,930
IS...

686
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,598
HARDLY SUPERIOR,

687
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,600
MENTALLY OR OTHERWISE.

688
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,729
THE THRALLS ARE NECESSARY
TO THE GAMES.

689
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:01,107
WE HAVE FOUND
ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS
OUR ONLY CHALLENGE--

690
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:04,652
THE ONLY THING
WHICH FURNISHES US
WITH PURPOSE.

691
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,363
IT'S AN UNPRODUCTIVE
PURPOSE,

692
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,740
UNWORTHY
OF YOUR INTELLECT.

693
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,368
WE USE
ONLY INFERIOR BEINGS.

694
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,786
WE HAVE FOUND...

695
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,706
THAT ALL LIFE FORMS
IN THE GALAXY

696
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,793
ARE CAPABLE
OF SUPERIOR DEVELOPMENT.

697
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,964
PERHAPS YOU'RE
NOT AS EVOLVED
AS YOU BELIEVE.

698
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,342
AN INTERESTING
SPECULATION, CAPTAIN.

699
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,261
YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
ARE MOST CHALLENGING.

700
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,012
YES, MOST CHALLENGING.

701
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,805
IT WAS HOPED
THAT SUCH NEW BLOOD

702
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,308
WOULD STIMULATE
OUR STOCK OF THRALLS.

703
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,894
HOW UNFORTUNATE THAT
YOU MUST BE DESTROYED.

704
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,400
OUR DESTRUCTION WILL RESULT
ONLY IN YOUR OWN.

705
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,985
YOU MAY CONTROL
THE "ENTERPRISE,"

706
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,779
BUT YOU CANNOT
MATCH THE FORCE

707
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,239
OF THE ENTIRE FEDERATION.

708
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,199
YOUR SHIP WILL
BE DESTROYED

709
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,285
BY A MAGNETIC STORM.

710
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,953
NO COMMUNICATIONS
WITH YOUR BASE

711
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,621
WILL BE POSSIBLE.

712
00:40:56,746 --> 00:41:00,499
YOUR FATE WILL REMAIN
A MYSTERY TO YOUR PEOPLE.

713
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,585
AND YOU CALL YOURSELVES
SUPERIOR!

714
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,296
YOU'RE MURDERERS

715
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,298
WITHOUT THE SPIRIT
TO REALLY WAGER

716
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:07,465
FOR THE LIVES YOU TAKE.

717
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,845
WAGER? EXPLAIN YOURSELF,
CAPTAIN.

718
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,347
MY PEOPLE PRIDE
THEMSELVES

719
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,266
ON BEING THE GREATEST,
MOST SUCCESSFUL

720
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,268
GAMBLERS
IN THE UNIVERSE.

721
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:21,396
WE COMPETE FOR EVERYTHING--
POWER, FAME, WOMEN--

722
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,480
EVERYTHING WE DESIRE,

723
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:27,319
AND IT IS OUR NATURE...
TO WIN.

724
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:28,445
AND FOR PROOF,
I OFFER YOU

725
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,863
OUR EXPLORATION
OF THIS GALAXY.

726
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,574
WE ARE AWARE
OF YOUR COMPETITIVE
ABILITIES, CAPTAIN.

727
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,035
WELL, THEN...

728
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,245
I WAGER...

729
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:42,917
THAT WITH WEAPONS
OF YOUR OWN CHOICE,

730
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,710
RIGHT HERE AND NOW,

731
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,964
MY PEOPLE CAN OVERCOME
AN EQUAL NUMBER OF THRALLS

732
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,090
SET AGAINST US.

733
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,592
100 QUATLOOS
ON THE NEWCOMERS.

734
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,053
400 QUATLOOS AGAINST
THE NEWCOMERS.

735
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,222
200 QUATLOOS AGAINST!

736
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,974
500 FOR THE NEWCOMERS.

737
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,018
CONTEST BY MULTIPLE
ELIMINATION.

738
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,687
WAIT! WAIT!
HEAR ME!

739
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:07,233
WE CAN'T WAGER FOR TRIFLES
LIKE QUATLOOS.

740
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,985
THE STAKES MUST BE HIGHER.

741
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,945
NAME YOUR STAKES,
CAPTAIN.

742
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,405
IF WE WIN,

743
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,573
THE "ENTERPRISE"
AND ITS CREW

744
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,201
LEAVES HERE IN SAFETY.

745
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:19,745
FURTHERMORE, ALL THE THRALLS
ON THE PLANET MUST BE FREED.

746
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,123
ANARCHY.
THEY WOULD STARVE.

747
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,291
YOU WILL EDUCATE
AND TRAIN THEM

748
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:26,378
TO ESTABLISH A NORMAL
SELF-GOVERNING CULTURE.

749
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:29,839
THRALLS GOVERN THEMSELVES?
RIDICULOUS!

750
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,132
WE HAVE DONE THE SAME

751
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,219
WITH CULTURES
THROUGHOUT THE GALAXY.

752
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,761
ARE YOU WILLING
TO ADMIT

753
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,763
THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T?

754
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,640
THERE IS NOTHING
WE CANNOT DO!

755
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,518
AND IF YOU LOSE,
CAPTAIN?

756
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,979
IF WE LOSE...

757
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:49,901
WE WILL REMAIN HERE,

758
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,861
THE ENTIRE CREW
OF THE "ENTERPRISE,"

759
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,613
THE MOST STUBBORN,
DETERMINED COMPETITORS
IN THE UNIVERSE.

760
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,367
WE'LL BECOME THRALLS,
ENTER YOUR GAMES,

761
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,826
OBEY YOUR ORDERS
WITHOUT REBELLION.

762
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,578
YOU'LL BE ASSURED
OF GENERATIONS

763
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,414
OF THE MOST EXCITING
WAGERING YOU'VE EVER HAD.

764
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:05,166
YOUR STAKES ARE INDEED
HIGH, CAPTAIN.

765
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,668
NOT FOR TRUE GAMESTERS.

766
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,796
WE WILL ACCEPT
YOUR STAKES
ON ONE CONDITION.

767
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,340
NAME IT.

768
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:13,799
AS LEADER
OF YOUR PEOPLE,

769
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,511
YOUR SPIRIT SEEMS
MOST INDOMITABLE.

770
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:17,678
WE SUGGEST YOU ALONE,

771
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,557
PITTED AGAINST
3 CONTESTANTS
OF OUR CHOOSING.

772
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,437
3 AGAINST ONE...

773
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:29,232
THOSE ARE
PRETTY HIGH ODDS.

774
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,443
NOT FOR TRUE
GAMESTERS, CAPTAIN.

775
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:34,028
YOUR...YOUR TERMS
ARE UNFAIR.

776
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,489
ON THE CONTRARY,
THEY'RE EXTREMELY
FAIR,

777
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,200
SINCE YOUR
ALTERNATIVE
IS DEATH.

778
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:44,247
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR TERMS.

779
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,124
GALT WILL
PREPARE YOU.

780
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,174
Provider: BECAUSE YOU WAGER
YOUR SKILL FOR ALL YOUR PEOPLE,

781
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,175
THEY WILL BE PERMITTED

782
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:57,218
TO WATCH THE OUTCOME
OF THE GAME

783
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,512
ON THE SHIP'S
VIEW SCREEN.

784
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,805
MR. SPOCK, LOOK!

785
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,723
Provider: CAPTAIN,
YOU WILL DEFEND.

786
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,101
THRALLS MUST STAY
IN THE BLUE AREA.

787
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,311
YOU WILL
TAKE THE YELLOW.

788
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:07,979
TOUCHING
AN OPPOSING COLOR

789
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,315
DEPRIVES A CONTESTANT
OF ONE WEAPON.

790
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,442
AN OPPONENT
MUST BE KILLED

791
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,486
TO BE REMOVED
FROM THE GAME.

792
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,905
IF ONLY WOUNDED,
HE IS REPLACED
BY A FRESH THRALL.

793
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,199
IS THAT CLEAR, CAPTAIN?

794
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,076
YES, THAT'S CLEAR.

795
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,162
WHAT IN THE NAME
OF HEAVEN IS THIS?

796
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,664
HEAVEN'S GOT VERY LITTLE
TO DO WITH THIS.

797
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,405
SHAHNA.

798
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:56,921
YOU LIED.

799
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,839
EVERYTHING YOU SAID.

800
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:39,004
THE THRALLS...
SURRENDER!

801
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,387
Provider: YOU HAVE WON,
CAPTAIN KIRK,

802
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,097
UNFORTUNATELY.

803
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,475
HOWEVER, THE TERMS OF THE WAGER
WILL BE HONORED.

804
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,017
YOU ARE FREE.

805
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:57,482
REMOVE YOUR COLLARS.

806
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,168
THE THRALLS
WILL BE TRAINED?

807
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,753
THEY WILL BE TRAINED.

808
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,171
WE HAVE SAID IT.

809
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:23,924
I THINK
YOU'LL FIND IT

810
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,343
A MUCH MORE
EXCITING GAME

811
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,052
THAN THE ONE
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING.

812
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:28,929
I'M SORRY, SHAHNA.

813
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,516
I DIDN'T LIE.

814
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,142
I DID
WHAT WAS NECESSARY.

815
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,268
SOMEDAY, I HOPE
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

816
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,104
I UNDERSTAND...
A LITTLE.

817
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:42,109
YOU WILL LEAVE US NOW?

818
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,277
YES.

819
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:47,198
TO GO BACK TO THE LIGHTS
IN THE SKY?

820
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:48,240
YES.

821
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:51,243
I WOULD LIKE TO GO
TO THOSE LIGHTS WITH YOU.

822
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,953
TAKE ME?

823
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,372
I CAN'T.

824
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,207
THEN TEACH ME HOW,

825
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,501
AND I WILL FOLLOW YOU.

826
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,961
THERE'S SO MUCH YOU MUST
LEARN HERE FIRST.

827
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,339
THE PROVIDERS
WILL TEACH YOU.

828
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:04,632
LEARN IT, SHAHNA.

829
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,718
ALL YOUR PEOPLE
MUST LEARN

830
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,469
BEFORE YOU CAN REACH
FOR THE STARS.

831
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,055
SHAHNA...

832
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,661
SCOTTY!

833
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:34,620
Scotty:
AYE, SIR.

834
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,750
BEAM US UP.

835
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,235
GOOD-BYE, JIM KIRK.

836
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,240
I WILL LEARN...

837
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,659
AND WATCH THE LIGHTS
IN THE SKY...

838
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,080
AND REMEMBER.
