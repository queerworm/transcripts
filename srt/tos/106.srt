00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,178
WITH AUTOMATED MACHINES
FOR COMPANY

344
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,057
AND 2 BROTHERS
TO COOK FOR,
MEND THEIR CLOTHES,

345
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,352
CANAL MUD A FOOT THICK
ON THEIR BOOTS EVERY TIME
THEY WALKED IN.

346
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,102
FINE, EVIE. FINE.

347
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,188
NO, IT'S NOT FINE!

348
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,650
WE'VE GOT MEN WILLING
TO BE OUR HUSBANDS
WAITING FOR US,

349
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,611
AND YOU'RE TAKING US
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION!

350
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,655
STARING AT US

351
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,950
LIKE WE WERE SATURNIUS
HAREM GIRLS OR SOMETHING.

352
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,535
THAT'S ENOUGH, EVIE.

353
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,915
THE ONLY CHARGES
ARE AGAINST MR. MUDD.

354
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,124
ILLEGAL OPERATION
OF A VESSEL.

355
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,793
DO YOU HAVE ANY DEFENSE
TO OFFER?

356
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,882
ONLY HEAVEN'S OWN TRUTH,
WHICH I'VE JUST GIVEN YOU.

357
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,930
THE HEARING IS CLOSED...

358
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,768
MR. MUDD TO BE HANDED OVER
TO THE LEGAL AUTHORITIES

359
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,687
AT OUR EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY.

360
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,278
AND WHAT ABOUT US?
WHAT HAPPENS TO US?

361
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,073
HELP US, PLEASE.
ALL OF US.

362
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,784
MISS McHURON,
IF YOU DON'T MIND--

363
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,663
OUR LAST CRYSTAL, SIR.
IT'S GONE.

364
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,624
Sulu: CAPTAIN KIRK,
ENGINEERING SECTION REPORTS

365
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,752
OUR ENTIRE
LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEM
IS NOW ON BATTERIES.

366
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,504
MR. SPOCK--
MISS McHURON, PLEASE.
WOULD YOU MIND?

367
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,674
MR. SPOCK,
WILL YOU CONTACT
THE MINERS ON RIGEL-12?

368
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,094
NOTIFY THEM THAT WE'LL NEED
THE LITHIUM CRYSTALS

369
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,887
IMMEDIATELY UPON ARRIVAL.

370
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,270
OH, YOU BEAUTIFUL GALAXY!

371
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,107
OH, THAT HEAVENLY
UNIVERSE!

372
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,068
WELL, GIRLS,
LITHIUM MINERS.

373
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,654
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

374
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,699
LONELY, ISOLATED,
OVERWORKED, RICH

375
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,743
LITHIUM MINERS!

376
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,370
GIRLS, DO YOU STILL
WANT HUSBANDS, HMM?

377
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,624
EVIE, YOU WON'T HAVE
TO BE SATISFIED WITH
A MERE SHIP'S CAPTAIN.

378
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,044
I'LL GET YOU A MAN
WHO CAN BUY YOU
A WHOLE PLANET.

379
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,338
MAGGIE, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE A COUNTESS.

380
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,299
RUTH, I'LL MAKE YOU
A DUCHESS.

381
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,384
AND I--

382
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,098
I'LL BE RUNNING
THIS STARSHIP.

383
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,145
CAPTAIN JAMES KIRK,
THE NEXT ORDERS YOU'RE TAKING

384
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,357
WILL BE GIVEN
BY HARCOURT FENTON MUDD!

385
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,742
CAPTAIN'S LOG--
STARDATE 1330.1.

386
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,787
POSITION--
14 HOURS OUT OF RIGEL-12.

387
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,665
WE'RE ON AUXILIARY
IMPULSE ENGINES.
FUEL LOW,

388
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,668
BARELY SUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE
ORBIT OVER THE PLANET.

389
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,379
LITHIUM REPLACEMENTS
ARE NOW IMPERATIVE.

390
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,340
THE EFFECT OF MUDD'S WOMEN
ON MY CREW CONTINUES TO GROW,

391
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,718
STILL TOTALLY UNEXPLAINED.

392
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:22,471
HARRY MUDD IS CONFINED
TO HIS QUARTERS UNDER GUARD.

393
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,643
Ruth: MAY I COME IN?

394
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,276
WHY, YES. PLEASE DO.

395
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,570
BY ALL MEANS.

396
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,368
CONNORS,
ARE YOU FINISHED?

397
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:49,707
I WAS WONDERING
WHAT THIS PLACE
LOOKED LIKE.

398
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,795
[BEEPING]

399
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,097
IT'S FASCINATING.

400
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,431
WOULD--WOULD YOU

401
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,935
WALK PAST MY PANEL
AGAIN, PLEASE?

402
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,645
YOUR WHAT?

403
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,481
MY MEDICAL SCANNER.

404
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,649
OH, WHY?

405
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,903
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME
AN EXAMINATION, ARE YOU?

406
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,197
NO. I WOULDN'T
TRUST MY--

407
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,032
MY JUDGMENT,
BELIEVE ME.

408
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,492
JUST WALK BY,
PLEASE.

409
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,291
[BEEPING]

410
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,586
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT.

411
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,467
I WONDERED,

412
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,178
WILL YOU BE EXAMINING
THE MINERS ON RIGEL-12?

413
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,306
YES, IF THEY NEED IT.

414
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,102
DO YOU MEAN YOU
HAVEN'T ASKED YET?

415
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,645
[BEEPING STOPS]

416
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,438
ARE THEY
IN GOOD HEALTH
AND ALL THAT?

417
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,315
WHAT?

418
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,819
OH, YES, THEY'RE
IN EXCELLENT HEALTH,

419
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,403
ALL 3 OF THEM.

420
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,572
OH. 3.

421
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,789
ARE YOU WEARING
SOME UNUSUAL
KIND OF PERFUME

422
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,750
OR SOMETHING
RADIOACTIVE,
MY DEAR?

423
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,878
NO. I'M JUST ME.

424
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:23,009
I WONDER WHAT
MAKES IT DO THAT.

425
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,636
Eve: CAPTAIN?

426
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,641
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

427
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,481
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
MISS McHURON, I DO.

428
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,025
I WAS TRYING
TO TAKE A WALK,

429
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,734
AND I JUST HAD TO
RUN IN SOMEPLACE.

430
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,239
YOU SEE, I MEAN,
ALL YOUR MEN
WERE LOOKING AT ME,

431
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,200
FOLLOWING ME
WITH THEIR EYES.

432
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,579
YES. I'LL HAVE TO
TALK TO THEM ABOUT THAT.

433
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,045
THEY, UH, THEY DON'T
DO THAT ORDINARILY,

434
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,463
MISS McHURON,

435
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,380
BUT SOMEHOW,
IN YOUR CASE,

436
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,466
AND THE LADIES
WITH YOU, IT'S...

437
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:08,637
WELL,
THEY'RE PROBABLY
JUST LONELY.

438
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,849
I CAN UNDERSTAND
LONELINESS.

439
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,352
YES.

440
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,065
YES, UH,
NOW, MISS McHURON,
IF YOU DON'T MIND--

441
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,774
I--I SUPPOSE--

442
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,401
I SUPPOSE
YOU UNDERSTAND IT
EVEN MORE.

443
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:27,365
I MEAN, HAVING TO RUN
A HUGE SHIP LIKE THIS

444
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,659
WITH SO MUCH
RESPONSIBILITY
EVERY MINUTE,

445
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,037
AND HAVING TO BE
SO CAREFUL

446
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,249
WITH ALL YOUR MEN
LOOKING UP TO YOU.

447
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:43,089
WELL, IT PROBABLY APPEARS
MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT IS.

448
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,757
HMM! I READ ONCE

449
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:48,261
A COMMANDER
HAS TO ACT LIKE
A PARAGON OF VIRTUE.

450
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,305
I NEVER MET A PARAGON.

451
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,141
NEITHER HAVE I.

452
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,061
WELL, OF COURSE NOT.
NO ONE IS.

453
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,064
BUT SOME PEOPLE
TRY TO PRETEND.

454
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,149
UM...

455
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:05,027
DO YOU, CAPTAIN?

456
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,072
MISS McHURON,
I DON'T--

457
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,074
OH, NO! OH!

458
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,326
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

459
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,953
I DON'T CARE
WHAT HARRY MUDD SAYS.

460
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,247
I DO LIKE YOU,

461
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,208
BUT I JUST CAN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

462
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,585
I HATE
THIS WHOLE THING!

463
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,687
Mudd: JUST 3?
YOU'RE SURE?

464
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,066
YES. THE MINERS
ARE HEALTHY
AND FAIRLY YOUNG.

465
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,651
LATER, DEAR. LATER.

466
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,654
MAGDA, DID YOU GET TO
YOUR COMMUNICATIONS MAN?

467
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,657
THE HEAD MINER
IS NAMED BEN CHILDRESS.

468
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,951
THE OTHERS ARE
GOSSETT AND BENTON.

469
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,661
AND THEY'VE
BEEN THERE--

470
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:59,081
ALMOST 3 YEARS NOW,
ALONE!

471
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,917
PERFECT. PERFECT.

472
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,461
3 OF THEM,

473
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:07,798
AND 3 LOVELY LADIES
HAS HARRY MUDD.

474
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,843
AND LITHIUM CRYSTALS,
MY DEAR,

475
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:14,054
ARE WORTH 300 TIMES
THEIR WEIGHT IN DIAMONDS,

476
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,932
THOUSANDS OF TIMES
THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD.

477
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,018
BUT THEY'LL BE
DOWN THERE,

478
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,061
AND WE'LL BE UP HERE,

479
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,604
CIRCLING 100 MILES
ABOVE THEM.

480
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,399
AND THERE'S A GUARD
OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR,
HARRY.

481
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,818
YOU CAN'T GET OUT
OF YOUR CABIN.

482
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,447
NO, MY DEARS.
AFTER ONE MORE
LITTLE JOB FOR YOU,

483
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,616
IT WON'T BE HARRY MUDD
THAT'S TRAPPED.

484
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,828
IT WILL BE
A GENTLEMAN NAMED
JAMES T...

485
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,543
I DON'T LIKE YOU!

486
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,340
AND I'M NOT VERY HAPPY
WITH MYSELF, EITHER.

487
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,925
Mudd: WELL, I'M NOT
REALLY SURPRISED.

488
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,969
I'VE SEEN YOU
NOTICING
THE CAPTAIN.

489
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:58,057
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO NOTICE THEM!

490
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,433
OH.

491
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,060
OH, HARRY.

492
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,271
I DON'T FEEL
VERY GOOD.

493
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,775
I THINK IT MUST BE
NEAR THE TIME.

494
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:15,699
I ASKED FOR
A PREORBITAL COURSE,
MR. FARRELL.

495
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,659
[BEEPS]

496
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,412
PREORBITAL COURSE
LOCKED IN, SIR.

497
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:23,416
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I'M GIVING AN ORDER
TWICE, GENTLEMEN.

498
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,624
WE'RE DOWN
TO BATTERY POWER,

499
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,252
AND WE'RE LOW
ON THAT.

500
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,211
IT WILL GET US
TO RIGEL-12, SIR,

501
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,338
BUT IT'LL BE
A SHAKY ORBIT.

502
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,757
JUST HANG US IN THERE
LONG ENOUGH TO GET
6 CRYSTALS, SCOTTY.

503
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:32,966
THAT'S ALL WE NEED.

504
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,927
I'LL
GET YOU THERE.

505
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,263
RIDICULOUS.

506
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:40,057
WHAT ARE WE
RUNNING HERE?

507
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,141
DID YOU
EXAMINE THEM?

508
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:44,103
DID YOU EXAMINE EVE?

509
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,603
SHE REFUSED.

510
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,899
WELL, COME ON,
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR.

511
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,529

00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,482
LOSING COMMUNICATIONS
WITH THE MINERS, SIR.

686
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,525
MAGNETIC STORM
SEEMS WORSE.

687
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,194
HAS CHILDRESS
REPORTED IN YET?

688
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,404
NO, SIR. HE AND THE GIRL
ARE STILL MISSING.

689
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,787
SORRY, SCOTTY.

690
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,373
HOW MUCH POWER
DO WE HAVE LEFT?

691
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,959
ABOUT
5 HOURS, SIR.

692
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,637
CAPTAIN'S LOG--

693
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,932
HAVE EXPENDED ALL BUT
43 MINUTES OF POWER.

694
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,642
SHIP'S CONDITION--
CRITICAL.

695
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,979
SEARCH NOW IN PROGRESS
7 HOURS, 31 MINUTES.

696
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,065
MAGNETIC STORMS
ARE EASING.

697
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,608
INFRARED READING.

698
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,028
CHECK TRAVERSE 3,

699
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,864
GRID 0-4-0.

700
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,950
ABOUT 11 MILES.
BEARING 1-2-1 FROM
THE MINING COMPANY.

701
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,702
Sulu: THAT'S
BEN CHILDRESS'
QUARTERS.

702
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,246
THERE'S A HEAT UNIT
OPERATING THERE.

703
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,122
IT COULD BE
A COOKSTOVE.

704
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:17,623
HAVE MUDD MEET ME
IN THE TRANSPORTER
ROOM.

705
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,000
MUDD?

706
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,877
THE NAME
OF THIS GAME.

707
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:49,781
[THUDS]

708
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:52,242
I HAD THINGS
WHERE I WANTED THEM.

709
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,952
I ATE
SOME OF YOUR FOOD,

710
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,578
SO I PAID
WITH SOME CHORES.

711
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,417
AND I DO
MY OWN COOKING.

712
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,001
AAH!

713
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,968
I'VE NOT LAID
A HAND ON YOU.

714
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,552
REMEMBER THAT.

715
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,431
OH, THE SOUND
OF MALE EGO.

716
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,724
YOU TRAVEL HALFWAY
ACROSS THE GALAXY,

717
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,811
AND IT'S STILL
THE SAME SONG.

718
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:23,064
THERE. YOU GOING
TO EAT OR TALK?

719
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:28,320
I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED TO SIT,
TASTE, AND ROLL MY EYES.

720
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,655
"OOH,
FEMALE COOKING AGAIN."

721
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,172
I'VE TASTED BETTER...

722
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,798
BY MY OWN HAND.

723
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,758
YOU'RE TASTING
SOME OF IT NOW.

724
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,469
I COULDN'T SCRAPE
3 LAYERS

725
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,304
OF YOUR LEAVINGS
OUT OF THAT PAN.

726
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,432
YOU FIND ME A WELL,
SOME DECENT WATER.
THEN TALK.

727
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:02,061
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
HANG YOUR PAN
OUT IN THE WIND

728
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:05,440
AND LET THE SAND
BLAST IT CLEAN?

729
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,566
OR HADN'T YOU
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?

730
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,012
IT MIGHT WORK.

731
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,480
THAT SOLITAIRE?

732
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,523
DOUBLE JACK.

733
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:51,403
THE RED 8
OUGHT TO GO
ON THE BLACK 9.

734
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:54,655
NOT IN DOUBLE JACK.

735
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,494
YOU'RE NOT ONLY PLAIN
AS AN OLD BUCKET,

736
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,371
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GOOD COMPANY.

737
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,084
WHAT THE DEVIL HAPPENED
TO YOUR LOOKS, ANYWAY?

738
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,877
I GOT TIRED OF YOU.

739
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,754
I SLUMPED.

740
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,923
YOU HEARD
WHAT I SAID.
YOU'RE HOMELY!

741
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:15,385
I'VE GOT ENOUGH
IN CRYSTALS ALREADY
TO BUY QUEENS...

742
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,594
BY THE GROSS!

743
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,265
I DIDN'T TOUCH HER.

744
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,642
THANK HEAVEN
YOU FOUND HER.

745
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,896
SHE'S BEEN BUBBLING
WITH GRATITUDE
EVER SINCE.

746
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,606
SIT DOWN.

747
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,318
TELL HIM.

748
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,362
TELL HIM, HARRY.

749
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:37,198
AH. YES, WELL--

750
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,743
THE VENUS DRUGS, HARRY.

751
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,787
VENUS DRUG?

752
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,830
I'VE HEARD
OF IT, BUT...

753
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,832
ISN'T THAT
JUST ONE OF
THOSE STORIES?

754
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,252
OH, IT EXISTS...

755
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:50,503
ILLEGALLY.

756
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,421
WELL,
ACTUALLY, YOU SEE,

757
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,839
IT'S A RELATIVELY
HARMLESS DRUG.

758
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,633
HARMLESS?

759
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,551
YEAH, UH...

760
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,971
WELL,
WHAT IT DOES IS
GIVE YOU MORE

761
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:01,680
OF WHATEVER YOU HAVE.

762
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,976
WELL, WITH MEN,
IT MAKES THEM
MORE MUSCULAR.

763
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,812
WOMEN, ROUNDER.

764
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,523
MEN, MORE AGGRESSIVE.
WOMEN, MORE FEMININE, AND--

765
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,110
HE GAVE IT TO THE WOMEN
BEFORE YOU MET THEM.

766
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,321
DOES THAT MEAN
THE OTHERS...

767
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,781
THEY REALLY LOOK
LIKE SHE DOES?

768
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,949
MR. CHILDRESS, I--

769
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,409
IS THAT
WHAT IT MEANS?

770
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,828
YES, THAT'S
WHAT IT MEANS!

771
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:29,750
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY PARTNERS?

772
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,002
THEY'VE LEFT FOR
THEIR QUARTERS DURING
THE STORM, CHILDRESS.

773
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,754
THEY'RE MARRIED--

774
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,923
SUBSPACE RADIO MARRIAGE.

775
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,387
IT WAS A FRAUD.
THEY CAN GET OUT OF IT.

776
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,764
IF THEY WANT TO.

777
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,475
WHY?

778
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,560
Mudd: YOU CAN'T
CONDEMN THE WOMEN.

779
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,437
I CAN!

780
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,523
A MAN GOES OUT
AND FIGHTS,

781
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:54,359
ALMOST DIES.

782
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,028
WE ALL ALMOST DIE.

783
00:44:57,153 --> 00:45:00,156
WE SHOULD HAVE,
BUT WE DIDN'T.

784
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:03,326
AND NOW THAT WE'VE
GOT THE GOOD LIFE
IN OUR HANDS,

785
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,411
YOU BRING US WOMEN
FOR WIVES THAT--

786
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:07,413
YOU DON'T WANT WIVES!

787
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:10,416
YOU WANT THIS.

788
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:13,794
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT,
MR. CHILDRESS.

789
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,339
AND I HOPE
YOU REMEMBER IT
AND DREAM ABOUT IT,

790
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,216
BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T HAVE IT!

791
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:21,052
IT'S NOT REAL!

792
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,669
IS THIS THE KIND
OF WIFE YOU WANT, BEN?

793
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,464
NOT SOMEONE
TO HELP YOU.

794
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,049
NOT A WIFE TO COOK

795
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,386
AND SEW AND CRY

796
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,222
AND NEED,

797
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,600
BUT THIS KIND?

798
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:13,812
SELFISH,

799
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,814
VAIN,

800
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,234
USELESS.

801
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,363
IS THIS WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT?

802
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,780
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

803
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,950
HERE IT IS.

804
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,994
QUITE A WOMAN,
EH, CHILDRESS?

805
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,373
A FAKE...

806
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,667
PUMPED UP BY A DRUG.

807
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,086
BY HERSELF.

808
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,089
SHE TOOK NO DRUG.

809
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,507
I SWALLOWED IT.

810
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,134
COLORED GELATIN.

811
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:46,178
YES, THEY TOOK AWAY
MY DRUG

812
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,307
AND SUBSTITUTED THAT.

813
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,393
BUT THAT CAN'T BE.

814
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,270
THERE'S ONLY ONE
KIND OF WOMAN.

815
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,355
OR MAN,
FOR THAT MATTER.

816
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,609
YOU EITHER BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF,
OR YOU DON'T.

817
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,655
ALL RIGHT,
CHILDRESS.

818
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,906
I'VE GONE
AS FAR WITH YOU
AS I INTEND TO.

819
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,618
I WANT THOSE
LITHIUM CRYSTALS,

YOU COULD POSSIBLY,
BY ACCIDENT,

00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,260
ARRANGE TO
LEAVE ME BEHIND HERE?

841
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,221

PUNISHMENT ENOUGH.

I CAN'T DO THAT,

IF YOU THINK
THAT'LL HELP.

THEY'LL THROW AWAY

EVER TRY CONSIDERING
