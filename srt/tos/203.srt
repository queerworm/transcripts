178
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,898
AYE, CAPTAIN.

179
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,905

180
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,704

181
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,416
I GUESS THEY TAKE
IT FASTER THAN WE
CAN GIVE IT.

182
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,752
CAPTAIN, THE MESSAGE
IS COMING IN NOW.

183
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,215
[COMPUTERIZED VOICE]
<i>U.S.S.</i> ENTERPRISE,
<i>THIS IS</i> NOMAD.

00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,301
<i>MY MISSION IS NON-HOSTILE.</i>

185
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,346
APPARENTLY, THEY GOT
WHAT THEY NEEDED

186
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,763
BEFORE THE COMPUTERS
BURNED OUT.

187
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,849
NOMAD.

<i>COMMUNICATION.</i>

189
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,396
<i>CAN YOU</i>
<i>LEAVE YOUR SHIP?</i>

190
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,904
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO COME ABOARD YOUR SHIP

191
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,114
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE
DIFFERENTIAL.

192
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,366
<i>NON SEQUITUR.</i>

193
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,911

195
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,209
<i>THAT WILL BE SATISFACTORY.</i>

196
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,212
DO YOU REQUIRE
ANY SPECIAL CONDITIONS,

197
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,756
ANY PARTICULAR ATMOSPHERE
OR ENVIRONMENT?

198
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,799

<i>I WILL COME ABOARD.</i>

199
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,260

200
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,511

NOT REALLY GOING TO

204
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,807
BRING THAT THING IN
HERE?

205
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,642
DO WE HAVE ANY
CHOICE, SCOTTY?

206
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,062

IT WON'T BE TAKING ANY
MORE SHOTS AT US.

207
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,440
LIEUTENANT, GET A REPAIR
CREW ON THAT COMPUTER.

208
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,483

209
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,485

215
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,579

A PROTECTIVE SCREEN.

219
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,614
I CANNOT
GET THROUGH.

220
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,408

GO UP AND KNOCK?

221
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,828
<i>RELATE YOUR POINT</i>

226
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,597
IF WE SHOW IT A CLOSEUP

227
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,474
IT HAS NO POINT
OF REFERENCE.

228
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,018
IT WON'T KNOW ANY MORE
THAN IT DOES NOW.

229
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,811
A REASONABLE COURSE.

230
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,147
IF YOU CARE
TO LEAVE YOUR SHIP,

231
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,358

00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,245
IN MY OPINION,
THAT'S A
MACHINE.

238
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,665
INDEED.
IT IS REACTING

239
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,834
MUCH LIKE A HIGHLY
SOPHISTICATED
COMPUTER.

240
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,547
<i>I AM</i> NOMAD.
<i>WHAT IS OPINION?</i>

241
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,091
OPINION IS A BELIEF,

242
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,594
A VIEW, A JUDGMENT.

243
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,762

245
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,434
<i>IT HAS CHANGED SINCE</i>
<i>THE POINT OF ORIGIN.</i>

246
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,645
<i>THERE WAS MUCH</i>

00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,981

249
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,444
WASN'T THERE A
PROBE CALLED NOMAD

250
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,820
LAUNCHED IN
THE EARLY 2000s?

251
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,032
YES. IT WAS

252
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,451

253

00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,999
<i>I WILL SCAN</i>

<i>YES.</i>

270

271
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,956
<i>YOU ARE FROM</i>
<i>THE THIRD PLANET?</i>

<i>A PLANET WITH ONE LARGE</i>

282
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,359
<i>YOU ARE THE KIRK,</i>
<i>THE CREATOR.</i>

283
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,985

284
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,570
WELL, I'M

285
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,238

00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:33,164

SOMETIMES.

290
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,002

291
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,004

296
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,896
THERE WAS NEVER ANY

297
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,690

299
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,657

322
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,089
AND I'M CONVINCED
THAT THIS OBJECT IS
INDEED THAT PROBE.

323
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,883
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

324
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,635
EARTH SCIENCE COULDN'T
BEGIN TO BUILD ANYTHING

325
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,010

THAT LONG AGO.

326
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,011

327
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,555

329
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,602
I SUBMIT THAT IT WAS
BADLY DAMAGED

330
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,604

TO REPAIR ITSELF.

331
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,689

333
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,193
ITS MISSION WAS
ESSENTIALLY PEACEFUL.

334
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,209

00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,836
AND YOU HAVE
NOT CORRECTED
BY STERILIZATION.

880
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:39,547
YOU HAVE MADE
THREE ERRORS.

881
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:40,839
<i>ERROR.</i>

882
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,925
<i>ERROR.</i>

883
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,051
<i>ERROR.</i>

884
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,470
<i>EXAMINE.</i>

885
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:48,681
YOU ARE FLAWED
AND IMPERFECT!

886
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,182
EXECUTE YOUR
PRIME FUNCTION!

887
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:54,395
<i>I SHALL</i>
<i>ANALYZE ERROR.</i>

888
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,065
<i>ANALYZE...</i>
<i>ERROR...</i>

889
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,067
NOW! GET THOSE
ANTI-GRAVS ON.

890
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,402
<i>EXAMINE...</i>

891
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,861
<i>ERROR.</i>

892
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:03,862
<i>ERROR.</i>

893
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,864
WE'VE GOT TO GET RID OF IT
WHILE IT'S TRYING TO THINK.

894
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,824
YOUR LOGIC
WAS IMPECCABLE,
CAPTAIN.

895
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,327
WE ARE IN
GRAVE DANGER.

896
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,245
SCOTTY,
THE TRANSPORTER ROOM.

897
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,748
<i>ANALYZE ERROR...</i>

898
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,625
<i>ERROR...</i>

899
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,918
SCOTTY,
SET THE CONTROLS
FOR DEEP SPACE--

900
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:18,919
210, MARK 1.

901
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,713
AYE, SIR.

902
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,675
<i>FAULTY!</i>

903
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,634
READY, SIR.

904
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:25,677
<i>FAULTY!</i>

905
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:26,594
NOMAD...

906
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:29,347
YOU ARE IMPERFECT!

907
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,641
<i>ERROR.</i>

908
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:32,433
<i>ERROR.</i>

909
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,934
EXERCISE
YOUR PRIME FUNCTION.

910
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,894
<i>FAULTY!</i>

911
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,439
<i>FAULTY!</i>

912
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,317
<i>MUST...ANALYZE.</i>

913
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:44,069
<i>ANALYZE...</i>

914
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,070
NOW.

915
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,572
ENERGIZING.

916
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,270
MY CONGRATULATIONS,
CAPTAIN.

917
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:19,856
A DAZZLING DISPLAY OF LOGIC.

918
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,107
YOU DIDN'T THINK
I HAD IT IN ME,
DID YOU, SPOCK?

919
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,401
NO, SIR.

920
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,073
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
LIKE TO KNOW

921
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:31,033
THAT LIEUTENANT UHURA
IS BACK TO COLLEGE LEVEL.

922
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,535
WE SHOULD HAVE HER
BACK ON THE JOB
WITHIN A WEEK.

923
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,911
GOOD, BONES, GOOD.

924
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:35,830
REMARKABLE.

925
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,749
WHAT?

926
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:42,044
THE DESTRUCTION OF NOMAD
WAS A GREAT WASTE, CAPTAIN.

927
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,714
IT WAS A REMARKABLE
INSTRUMENT.

928
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,717
WHICH MIGHT WELL
HAVE DESTROYED MORE
BILLIONS OF LIVES.

929
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,343
IT'S WELL GONE.

930
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,262
BESIDES, WHAT ARE YOU
FEELING SO BADLY ABOUT?

931
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:54,098
IT'S NOT EASY TO LOSE
A BRIGHT AND PROMISING SON.

932
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:55,558
SIR?

933
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,102
WELL, IT THOUGHT
I WAS ITS MOTHER,

934
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:00,229
DIDN'T IT?

935
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,189
DO YOU THINK I'M
COMPLETELY WITHOUT
FEELINGS, MR. SPOCK?

936
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,108
YOU SAW WHAT IT
DID FOR SCOTTY.

937
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,652
WHAT A DOCTOR
IT WOULD'VE MADE.

938
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,282
MY SON THE DOCTOR.

939
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,369
KIND OF GETS YOU
RIGHT THERE,
DOESN'T IT?
