00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,789
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

181
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,585
I INTEND TO FIND OUT.

182
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,712
I'LL BE IN
THE MEDICAL RECORD LIBRARY.

183
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,839
OH, CAPTAIN.

184
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,175
SUBSPACE MESSAGE
FROM STARFLEET.
THEY'RE INQUIRING--

185
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,134
NOT NOW, LIEUTENANT.

186
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,261
HAVE THE SECURITY
DUTY OFFICER

187
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,554
REPORT TO ME
ON THE BRIDGE
IMMEDIATELY.

188
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,180
AYE, SIR.
SPOCK?

189
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,639
CONTINUING SCANNING,
CAPTAIN.

190
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,682
STILL NO READINGS
OF LIFE FORMS

191
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,351
ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE.

192
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,979
LET'S ASSUME
THAT IT'S SOMETHING
SO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

193
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,358
THAT OUR SENSORS
WOULD NOT IDENTIFY IT
AS A LIFE FORM.

194
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,279
YOU MENTIONED
DI-KIRONIUM, CAPTAIN.

195
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,073
SUPPOSE IT WAS COMPOSED
OF THAT RARE ELEMENT...

196
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,201
A STRANGE,
GASEOUS CREATURE.

197
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,036
I HAVE SCANNED
FOR THAT ELEMENT, CAPTAIN.

198
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,746
THERE IS NO TRACE
OF DI-KIRONIUM

199
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,498
ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE
OR IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

200
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,167
SUPPOSE IT
CAMOUFLAGED ITSELF?

201
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,963
LET'S ASSUME
THAT IT'S INTELLIGENT,

202
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,382
THAT IT KNOWS THAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT.

203
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,842
TO HIDE FROM A SENSOR SCAN,

204
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,346
IT WOULD HAVE TO
BE ABLE TO CHANGE
ITS MOLECULAR STRUCTURE,

205
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,723
LIKE GOLD
CHANGING ITSELF TO LEAD

206
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,892
OR WOOD CHANGING ITSELF
TO IVORY.

207
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,521
YOU'VE JUST
SUGGESTED SOMETHING...

208
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,610
THAT NEVER OCCURRED
TO ME.

209
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,989
IT MAY PROVIDE SOME
ANSWERS TO A TAPE RECORD

210
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,491
WHICH I THINK
YOU'LL FIND DR. McCOY

211
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,410
IS LOOKING AT
THIS VERY MOMENT.

212
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,246
CHEKOV,
TAKE OVER ON SCANNER.

213
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,135
ENSIGN GARROVICK
REPORTING, SIR.

214
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,139
ARE YOU
THE NEW SECURITY OFFICER?

215
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,141
YES, SIR.

216
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,058
WAS YOUR FATHER--

217
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,602
YES, SIR, HE WAS,
BUT I DON'T EXPECT

218
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,479
ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT
ON THAT ACCOUNT.

219
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,526
YOU'LL GET NONE
ABOARD THIS SHIP, MISTER.

220
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,734
YES, SIR.

221
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,864
CAPTAIN, I HAVE A REPORT
ON ENSIGN RIZZO.

222
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,282
HE'S DEAD, SIR.

223
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,374
YOU KNEW RIZZO?

224
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,626
YES, SIR.
WE WERE GOOD FRIENDS,

225
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,794
GRADUATED
THE ACADEMY TOGETHER.

226
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,962
YOU'LL GET A CRACK
AT WHAT KILLED HIM.

227
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,922
INTERESTED?

228
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,216
YES, I AM, SIR.

229
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,258
I WANT 4 MEN
ARMED WITH PHASER TWO

230
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,010
SET FOR DISRUPTER EFFECT.

231
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,637
JOIN ME IN THE TRANSPORTER
ROOM IN 5 MINUTES.

232
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,514
YOU'LL ACCOMPANY ME
TO THE PLANET SURFACE.

233
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,973
YES, SIR.

234
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,651
[TRICORDER BEEPING]

235
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,573
READING IS CHANGING, SIR.

236
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,288
SPOCK WAS RIGHT.
NOTICE THE MOLECULAR SHIFT?

237
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,919
DI-KIRONIUM
READING NOW, SIR.

238
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,296
BEARING 94 MARK 7,

239
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,591
ANGLE OF ELEVATION
6 DEGREES, HOLDING STEADY.

240
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,967
OVER THAT RISE.

241
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,219
TAKE TWO MEN,
CIRCLE AROUND
TO THE LEFT.

242
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,680
I'LL TAKE
THE OTHER TWO

243
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,932
AND GO
THE OTHER WAY.

244
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,016
THE CREATURE
IS DANGEROUS.

245
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,227
IF YOU SEE IT...

246
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,438
FIRE FULL PHASERS.

247
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,522
YES, SIR.

248
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,986
HENSON, BARDOLI...

249
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,656
COME WITH ME.

250
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,606
A PHASER!
COME ON!

251
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:38,652
GARROVICK, DID YOU--

252
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,775
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 3619.6.

253
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,196
ONE OF THE MEN IN CRITICAL
CONDITION, THE OTHER IS DEAD.

254
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:28,075
AND I, I AM NOW
EVEN MORE CONVINCED

255
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,995
THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY
AN INTELLIGENT CREATURE,

256
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,207
BUT THE SAME WHICH
DECIMATED THE CREW
OF THE U.S.S. "FARRAGUT"

257
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,877
11 YEARS AGO IN ANOTHER
PART OF THE GALAXY.

258
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,338
BOTH SPOCK AND McCOY
ARE DOUBTFUL OF THIS,

259
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,340
AND I SENSE THEY ALSO
DOUBT MY DECISION

260
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,426
TO STAY AND FIGHT THE THING.

261
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,804
WHY AM I KEEPING THE SHIP HERE?

262
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,097
MR. GARROVICK, WE'VE
STUDIED YOUR REPORT.

263
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,974
MR. SPOCK, BEGIN.

264
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,351
WHAT WAS THE SIZE

265
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,103
OF THE THING YOU SAW,
ENSIGN?

266
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,606
I'D SAY IT MEASURED
FROM, UH...

267
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,067
10 TO 60 CUBIC METERS,
SIR.

268
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,820
IT VARIED IN SIZE,

269
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,613
FLUCTUATED AS IT MOVED.

270
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,114
COMPOSITION?

271
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,492
IT WAS LIKE A--A...

272
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,786
GASEOUS CLOUD.

273
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,329
PARTS OF IT
I COULD SEE THROUGH.

274
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,373
OTHER PARTS
WERE MORE DENSE.

275
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:19,794
ENSIGN, DID YOU
SENSE ANY INTELLIGENCE
IN THIS GASEOUS CLOUD?

276
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,628
DID I WHAT, SIR?

277
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,005
DID YOU GET
ANY SUBCONSCIOUS
IMPRESSIONS

278
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,466
THAT THIS WAS A CREATURE,
A LIVING, THINKING THING,

279
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,636
RATHER THAN JUST
A STRANGE CLOUD

280
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,346
OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS?

281
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,931
NO, SIR.

282
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,559
BUT YOU DIDN'T COME INTO
ACTUAL CONTACT WITH IT,
DID YOU?

283
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,644
NO, SIR. I WAS
FURTHEST AWAY FROM IT.

284
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,563
IT, UH...

285
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,190
IT SEEMED
TO COME OUT OF NOWHERE,

286
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,233
HOVERED FOR A MOMENT,

287
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,984
THEN MOVED TOWARD MY MEN.

288
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,820
IT WAS FAST,
INCREDIBLY FAST.

289
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,113
DID YOU SAY IT HOVERED?

290
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,073
YES, SIR.
YOU DID FIRE AT IT?

291
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,117
YES, SIR, I DID.

292
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,869
WHAT DISTANCE WERE YOU
FROM THE CREATURE?

293
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,538
ABOUT...20 YARDS, SIR.

294
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,291
YOU FIRED AT A LARGE,
HOVERING TARGET

295
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,877
AT THAT DISTANCE
AND MISSED?

296
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,837
YES. I--

297
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:07,091
WELL, I DIDN'T FIRE
WHILE IT WAS HOVERING, SIR.

298
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,676
YOU MEAN YOU FROZE?

299
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,137
NO...SIR. I...

300
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,055
DIDN'T EXACTLY FREEZE.

301
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,892
WHAT EXACTLY
WERE YOU DOING?

302
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,936
WELL, I WAS STARTLED...

303
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,688
FOR A SECOND.

304
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,523
AND THEN...
BY THE TIME I FIRED,

305
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,608
THE THING WAS
ALREADY MOVING.

306
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,323
DO YOU HAVE ANY
FURTHER INFORMATION?

307
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,450
NO, SIR.

308
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,201
DO YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS?

309
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,999
I, UH...

310
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,962
I ONLY HESITATED
FOR A MOMENT, SIR.

311
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,631
I'M SORRY.

312
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,549
ENSIGN, YOU'RE RELIEVED
OF ALL DUTIES

313
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,218
AND CONFINED TO QUARTERS
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

314
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,428
YES, SIR.

315
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,103
YOU WERE A LITTLE HARD
ON THE BOY, JIM.

316
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,105
HE FROZE.

317
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,024
ONE MAN WAS KILLED.

318
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,275
ANOTHER MAY DIE.

319
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,363
CAPTAIN,
SCIENTIFICALLY--

320
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,198
YOU'LL BOTH
BE FILING REPORTS.

321
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,616
MAKE YOUR COMMENTS
AND RECOMMENDATIONS THEN.

322
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:34,971
CAPTAIN,
WHILE WE WAIT,

323
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,389
I'VE TAKEN THE
LIBERTY OF CLEANING

324
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,266
THE RADIOACTIVE
DISPOSAL VENT ON
NUMBER 2 IMPULSE ENGINE,

325
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,101
BUT WE'LL BE READY
TO LEAVE ORBIT
IN UNDER HALF AN HOUR.

326
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,646
WE'RE NOT LEAVING ORBIT,
MR. SCOTT.
NOT THAT QUICKLY.

327
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,357
CAPTAIN, "YORKTOWN" REQUESTING
INFORMATION ON HOW SOON

328
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,942
WE EXPECT TO RENDEZVOUS
WITH THEM.

329
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,318
THANK YOU.

330
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,487
THE MEDICINE
FOR THETA 7 COLONY

331
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,531
IS NOT ONLY NEEDED
DESPERATELY, IT HAS
A LIMITED STABILITY--

332
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,825
I'M AWARE
OF THE SITUATION, ENGINEER,

333
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,327
AND I'M GETTING
A LITTLE TIRED
OF MY SENIOR OFFICERS

334
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,787
CONSPIRING AGAINST ME.

335
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:05,668
FORGIVE ME.

336
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,795
PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T HAVE USED
THE WORD CONSPIRE.

337
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,839
AGREED, SIR.

338
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,424
SCANNER READINGS.

339
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,342
NOTHING, SIR.
CONTINUING TO SCAN.

340
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,302
ARE YOU AWARE THAT
IT CAN CHANGE ITS
MOLECULAR STRUCTURE?

341
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,345
YES, SIR.

342
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,472
ARE YOU SCANNING
FOR ANY UNUSUAL
MOVEMENT?

343
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,682
YES, SIR.

344
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,142
ANY TYPE
OF GASEOUS CLOUD?

345
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,728
WE'VE RUN A FULL
SCANNER PROBE TWICE.

346
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:24,270
THEN RUN IT 20 TIMES

347
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,563
IF THAT'S
WHAT IT TAKES!

348
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,452
I HOPE I'M NOT
DISTURBING YOU, DOCTOR.

349
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,871
INTERRUPTING
ANOTHER AUTOPSY REPORT

350
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,832
IS NO DISTURBANCE, MR. SPOCK.
IT'S A RELIEF.

351
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,919
I NEED YOUR ADVICE.

352
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,380
THEN I NEED A DRINK.

353
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,758
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
YOUR REASONING.

354
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,718
YOU NEED ADVICE
FROM ME?

355
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,011
YOU MUST BE KIDDING.

356
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,596
I DO NOT JOKE,
DOCTOR.

357
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,223
PERHAPS I
SHOULD REPHRASE
MY STATEMENT.

358
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,602
I REQUIRE
AN OPINION.

359
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,896
THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS
OF HUMAN IRRATIONALITY

360
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,522
I DO NOT YET COMPREHEND...

361
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,486
OBSESSION, FOR ONE.

362
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:18,074
THE PERSISTENT,
SINGLE-MINDED FIXATION
ON ONE IDEA.

363
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,492
JIM AND HIS CREATURE?

364
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,952
PRECISELY.

365
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,078
HAVE YOU STUDIED
THE INCIDENT

366
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,538
INVOLVING
THE U.S.S. "FARRAGUT"?

367
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,540
NO. WITH ALL THESE
DEATHS AND INJURIES,

368
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,960
I'VE ONLY HAD A CHANCE
TO SCAN THE TAPES.

369
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,545
THERE ARE 8 OR 10 HOURS
OF RECORD TAPES THERE.

370
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,881
FORTUNATELY,
I READ SOMEWHAT FASTER.

371
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,300
IN BRIEF, DOCTOR,
NEARLY HALF THE CREW,

372
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,845
AND THE CAPTAIN,
WERE ANNIHILATED.

373
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,723
THE CAPTAIN'S NAME
WAS GARROVICK.

374
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,934
THE SAME AS OUR ENSIGN.

375
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,185
HIS FATHER.

376
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,939
AMONG THE SURVIVORS
WAS A YOUNG OFFICER

377
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,733
ON HIS FIRST
DEEP-SPACE ASSIGNMENT--

378
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,235
JAMES T. KIRK.

379
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,197
AND THERE IS STILL MORE.

380
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,407
I SUGGEST YOU STUDY THIS.

381
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:12,336
Kirk, voice-over:
PERSONAL LOG, STARDATE 3620.7.

382
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,548
HAVE I THE RIGHT TO JEOPARDIZE
MY CREW, MY SHIP

383
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,843
FOR A FEELING I CAN'T EVEN
PUT INTO WORDS?

384
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,260
NO MAN ACHIEVES
STARFLEET COMMAND

385
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,513
WITHOUT RELYING ON INTUITION,

386
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,599
BUT HAVE I MADE
A RATIONAL DECISION?

387
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,852
AM I LETTING
THE HORRORS OF THE PAST

388
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,688
DISTORT MY JUDGMENT
OF THE PRESENT?

389
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,740
MIND IF I COME IN?

390
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,294
KIRK TO BRIDGE.
SCANNING REPORT.

391
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,214
Chekov: CONTINUED SCANNING, SIR.

392
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,798
NO UNUSUAL READINGS.

393
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,635
MAINTAIN SEARCH.
KIRK OUT.

394
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,973
IT CAN'T HAVE
JUST VANISHED.

395
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,436
SOMETIMES THEY DO,
IF WE'RE LUCKY.

396
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,856
MONSTERS COME
IN MANY FORMS.

397
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,608
YOU KNOW THE GREATEST
MONSTER OF THEM ALL,
JIM?

398
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,694
GUILT.

399
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,113
GET TO THE POINT.

400
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,321
JIM, WHEN
A YOUNG OFFICER

401
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,575
IS EXPOSED
TO UNKNOWN DANGERS
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

402
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,203
HE'S UNDER TREMENDOUS
EMOTIONAL STRESS.

403
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,829
NOW, WE ALL KNOW THAT.

404
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,249
ENSIGN GARROVICK IS
A SHIP-COMMAND DECISION.

405
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,960
YOU'RE STRAYING OUT OF
YOUR FIELD, DOCTOR.

406
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,294
AM I?

407
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,632
I WAS SPEAKING OF
LIEUTENANT JAMES T. KIRK

408
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,217
OF THE STARSHIP
"FARRAGUT."

409
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,846
11 YEARS AGO, YOU
WERE THE YOUNG OFFICER

410
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,933
AT THE PHASER STATION
WHEN SOMETHING ATTACKED.

411
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,685
ACCORDING TO THE TAPES,
THIS YOUNG
LIEUTENANT KIRK

412
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,606
INSISTED
UPON BLAMING HIMSELF.

413
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,151
BECAUSE I DELAYED
IN THE FIRING AT IT.

414
00:21:58,276 --> 00:21:59,944
YOU HAD
A NORMAL EMOTION.
YOU WERE STARTLED.

415
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,195
YOU DELAYED FIRING
FOR A GRAND TOTAL

416
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,780
OF PERHAPS TWO SECONDS.

417
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,407
IF I HADN'T DELAYED,

418
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,700
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

419
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,620
THE SHIP'S EXEC
DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK SO.

420
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,580
HIS LOG ENTRY
WAS QUITE CLEAR
ON THE SUBJECT--

421
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,041
"LIEUTENANT KIRK
IS A FINE YOUNG OFFICER

422
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,085
WHO PERFORMED
WITH UNCOMMON BRAVERY."

423
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,420
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

424
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,843
IT KILLED 200 CREWMEN.

425
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,179
CAPTAIN GARROVICK WAS
VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU,

426
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,223
WASN'T HE, JIM?

427
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,766
YES.

428
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,892
HE WAS
MY COMMANDING OFFICER

429
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:35,104
FROM THE DAY
I LEFT THE ACADEMY.

430
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,605
ONE OF THE FINEST MEN
I EVER KNEW.

431
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,776
I COULD HAVE KILLED
THAT THING

432
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,113
IF I'D FIRED SOON ENOUGH
THE FIRST TIME.

433
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,116
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT, JIM.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT

434
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,618
ANY MORE THAN YOU
KNOW THAT GARROVICK
COULD HAVE DESTROYED IT.

435
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,247
I CAN'T HELP HOW I FEEL.
THERE'S...

436
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:56,250
AN INTELLIGENCE
ABOUT IT, BONES.

437
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,794
A MALEVOLENCE. IT'S EVIL.

438
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,923
IT MUST BE DESTROYED.

439
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,136
TO BE SO OBSESSED...

440
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,386
OBSESSED?

441
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,184
THAT YOU
COULD DESTROY YOURSELF,

442
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,477
YOUR CAREER, A YOUNG BOY

443
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,521
WHO REMINDS YOU OF
YOURSELF 11 YEARS AGO.

444
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,731
DON'T PUSH OUR FRIENDSHIP
PAST THE POINT

445
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:19,773
WHERE I HAVE TO TAKE
OFFICIAL--

446
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,150
I'M NOT, JIM.

447
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,447
THIS IS PROFESSIONAL,
CAPTAIN.

448
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:31,493
I AM PREPARING
A MEDICAL LOG ENTRY

449
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,663
ON MY ESTIMATION
OF THE PHYSICAL
AND EMOTIONAL CONDITION

450
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,414
OF A STARSHIP CAPTAIN.

451
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,550
WHICH REQUIRES A WITNESS
OF COMMAND GRADE.

452
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,612
DO I TAKE IT, DOCTOR,
COMMANDER...

453
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,949
THAT BOTH OF YOU
OR EITHER OF YOU

454
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,202
CONSIDER ME UNFIT
OR INCAPACITATED?

455
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,121
CORRECTLY PHRASED,
CAPTAIN.

456
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,872
AS RECOMMENDED
IN THE MANUAL.

457
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,084
OUR REPLY,
ALSO AS RECOMMENDED, IS,

458
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,337
SIR, WE HAVE NOTED
IN YOUR RECENT BEHAVIOR
CERTAIN ITEMS,

459
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:26,257
WHICH, ON THE SURFACE,
SEEM UNUSUAL.

460
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,759
WE RESPECTFULLY
ASK PERMISSION
TO INQUIRE FURTHER--

461
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,261
BLAST IT!
FORGET THE MANUAL!

462
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,891
ASK YOUR QUESTIONS.

463
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,935
SIR, THE U.S.S. "YORKTOWN"

464
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,062
IS WAITING NOW
AT THE RENDEZVOUS POINT.

465
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,314
IT CARRIES
PERISHABLE DRUGS--

466
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,731
SPARE ME THE RECITATION,
SPOCK. I KNOW THE FACTS.

467
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,776
THEY NEED
THOSE VACCINES ON
THETA 7, CAPTAIN.

468
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,694
NOW, WHY ARE WE
DELAYING HERE?

469
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,655
BECAUSE I'M CONVINCED THAT
THIS IS THE SAME CREATURE

470
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,698
THAT ATTACKED THE "FARRAGUT"
11 YEARS AGO.

471
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,409
CREATURE, CAPTAIN?

472
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,661
MY REPORT IS ON THE TAPES.

473
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,205
AS IT ATTACKED US
11 YEARS AGO,

474
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:05,754
AS I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS,
I COULD FEEL

475
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,089
THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE THING.

476
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,757
I COULD SENSE IT
THINKING, PLANNING.

477
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:13,179
YOU SAY YOU COULD SENSE
ITS INTELLIGENCE, CAPTAIN?

478
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,890
HOW DID IT
COMMUNICATE WITH YOU?

479
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,392
YOU STATE
THAT IT HAPPENED

480
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,227
JUST AS YOU LOST
CONSCIOUSNESS.

481
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,561
A SEMICONSCIOUS MIND

482
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,105
IS A VERY
TRICKY THING.

483
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,065
A MAN NEVER KNOWS
JUST HOW MUCH
IS REAL

484
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,650
OR HOW MUCH
IS IMAGINATION.

485
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:32,530
WHATEVER IT IS, DOCTOR,
WHATEVER IT IS,

486
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,074
WOULDN'T YOU CALL IT DEADLY?

487
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,533
YES. THERE'S
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

488
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:39,621
AND WHAT IF IT IS
THE SAME CREATURE

489
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,332
THAT ATTACKED 11 YEARS AGO,

490
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:44,793
FROM A PLANET OVER
1,000 LIGHT-YEARS FROM HERE?

491
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,964
OBVIOUSLY, CAPTAIN, IF IT IS
AN INTELLIGENT CREATURE,

492
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,841
IF IT IS THE SAME ONE,

493
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,094
IF IT THEREFORE IS
CAPABLE OF SPACE TRAVEL,

494
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,763
IT COULD POSE A GREAT THREAT
TO INHABITED PLANETS.

495
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,891
A LOT OF IFS, I AGREE,

496
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,894
BUT IN
MY COMMAND JUDGMENT,

497
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,729
THEY OUTWEIGH
OTHER FACTORS.

498
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,607
INTUITION, HOWEVER
ILLOGICAL, MR. SPOCK,

499
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,736
IS RECOGNIZED
AS A COMMAND PREROGATIVE.

500
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,863
JIM, WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO GANG UP ON YOU.

501
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,073
AND YOU HAVEN'T, DOCTOR.

502
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,366
YOU'VE EXPRESSED
THE PROPER CONCERN,

503
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,243
YOU'VE ASKED
THE PROPER QUESTIONS.

504
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:21,955
YOU'VE BOTH
DONE YOUR DUTY.

505
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:26,377
NOW, MAY I ASK
WHAT MEDICAL LOG ENTRY

506
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,045
YOU INTEND TO MAKE?

507
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,341
AT THIS POINT,
MY MEDICAL LOG
REMAINS OPEN.

508
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,426
IN THAT CASE, GENTLEMEN--

509
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,885
Chekov:
BRIDGE TO CAPTAIN.
COME IN.

510
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,387
KIRK HERE.

511
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,222
I HAVE A READING
ON THE, UH,

512
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,515
WHATEVER IT IS,
CAPTAIN,

513
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,351
LEAVING
THE PLANET'S SURFACE,
HEADING INTO SPACE.

514
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,311
ALL DECKS, RED ALERT.
RED ALERT.

515
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,854
PREPARE TO LEAVE ORBIT.

516
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,023
[ALARM SOUNDS]

517
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,421
CAPTAIN, WE CAN'T MAINTAIN
WARP 8 SPEED MUCH LONGER.

518
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,089
PRESSURES ARE APPROACHING
THE CRITICAL POINT.

519
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,673
RANGE, MR. CHEKOV.

520
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,009
.04 LIGHT-YEARS AHEAD.

521
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,595
OUR PHASERS WON'T
REACH IT, SIR.

522
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,723
WE ARE BARELY CLOSING IN
ON IT, CAPTAIN.

523
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,892
WE COULD BE
PURSUING IT FOR DAYS.

524
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,227
IF NECESSARY.

525
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:28,105
DO WHAT YOU CAN TO
INCREASE OUR SPEED, SCOTT.

526
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,275
AYE, SIR.

527
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,032
EXTREME MAGNIFICATION,
MR. CHEKOV.

528
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,701
MAGNIFICATION...12.

529
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,038
THERE, SIR...

530
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,248
GOT IT.

531
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,548
SPOCK...

532
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,677
HOW DO YOU READ THAT?

533
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,514
CONFLICTING DATA, CAPTAIN.

534
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,183
IT SEEMS TO BE
IN A BORDERLINE STATE

535
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,727
BETWEEN MATTER AND ENERGY--
ELEMENTS OF BOTH.

536
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:11,106
IT COULD POSSIBLY USE
GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS
FOR PROPULSION.

537
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,610
AND YOU DON'T FIND THAT
SOPHISTICATED, MR. SPOCK?

538
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,654
EXTREMELY EFFICIENT,
CAPTAIN.

539
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,447
WHETHER THAT INDICATES
INTELLIGENCE

540
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,948
IS ANOTHER MATTER.

541
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,159
OPEN HATCH ON IMPULSE
ENGINE NUMBER 2.

542
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,495
MR. SCOTT WAS DOING
AN A.I.D. CLEANUP ON IT.

543
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,164
WE WON'T BE USING
THE IMPULSE ENGINES.
TURN THE ALARM OFF.

544
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,374
AYE, SIR.

545
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,631
CAPTAIN, WE CAN'T DO IT.

546
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,633
IF WE KEEP THIS SPEED,
WE'LL BLOW UP
ANY MINUTE NOW.

547
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,859
GO TO WARP 6.

548
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,469
HI.

549
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,346
EVERYONE ELSE
IS AT ALERT STATION,

550
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,390
SO I BROUGHT YOU
SOME DINNER.

551
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,849
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

552
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,268
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

553
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,521
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

554
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,316
ARE WE STILL
CHASING THAT THING

555
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,484
HALFWAY ACROSS THE GALAXY?

556
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,152
YES.

557
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,739
HAS THE CAPTAIN LOST
HIS SENSE OF BALANCE?

558
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,532
MAYBE.

559
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,618
IS THE ENTIRE CREW
ABOUT READY TO EXPLODE?

560
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,327
POSITIVELY.

561
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,496
YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU'RE OUT OF IT.

562
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,457
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
OUT OF IT?

563
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,376
I CAUSED IT.

564
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,545
YOU KNOW THAT, TOO,
DON'T YOU?

565
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,922
IF I'D FIRED MY PHASER
QUICKLY ENOUGH
ON ARGUS 10,

566
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,257
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE
HAPPENED.

567
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,303
YOU KNOW, SELF-PITY'S
A TERRIBLE FIRST COURSE.

568
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:05,512
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
THE SOUP INSTEAD?

569
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:08,390
I TOLD YOU, CHRISTINE,
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

570
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,894
DR. McCOY THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

571
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,939
THIS IS HIS OFFICIALLY LOGGED
PRESCRIPTION FOR YOU.

572
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,441
IT HAS ONE WORD ON IT--

573
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,817
EAT.

574
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,486
NOW, IF YOU DON'T
FOLLOW HIS ORDERS,

575
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:23,322
DR. McCOY COULD
AND POSSIBLY WOULD

576
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,491
HAVE YOU HAULED DOWN
TO SICKBAY

577
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,242
AND FED INTRAVENOUSLY.

578
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,921
WHAT'S THAT?

579
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,215
HMM? THIS?

580
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,972
A SURVEY ON CYGNIAN
RESPIRATORY DISEASES?

581
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,641
I THOUGHT YOU TOOK
GARROVICK SOME FOOD.

582
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,601
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WITH THIS?

583
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,269
APPLYING PSYCHOLOGY.

584
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,155
THE CREATURE IS SLOWING.
IT'S DOWN TO WARP 2.

585
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,116
REDUCE SPEED.

586
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,954
APPROACH SLOWLY.

587
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,956
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

588
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,000
IT WAS
OUTRUNNING US.

589
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,878
MAYBE IT'S DECIDED
TO FIGHT.

590
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,254
PHASERS READY.

591
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,131
PHASERS
SHOW READY, SIR.

592
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,570
[ALARM SOUNDS]

593
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:47,030
Kirk: BATTLE STATIONS.
ALL DECKS TO BATTLE STATIONS.

594
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,156
THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

595
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,200
ALL DECKS
TO BATTLE STATIONS.

596
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:57,374
IT'S COMING
TO A FULL HALT, SIR.

597
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,751
MAGNIFICATION 1.

598
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:06,383
MOVE IN CLOSELY,
MR. CHEKOV.

599
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,634
SUBLIGHT ONE-QUARTER SPEED.

600
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,266
CAPTAIN, REQUEST PERMISSION
TO RETURN TO MY POST.

601
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,685
WITHIN PHASER RANGE,
SIR.

602
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,729
LOCK ALL PHASERS
ON TARGET.

603
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:19,312
LOCKED ON TARGET.

604
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,690
FIRE PHASERS,
MR. CHEKOV.

605
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,698
PHASERS INEFFECTUAL,
SIR.

606
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,325
PHOTON TORPEDOES.
MINIMUM SPREAD PATTERN.

607
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,828
MINIMUM PATTERN
READY, SIR.

608
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,329
FIRE PHOTON TORPEDOES.

609
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,299
THERE.
IT'S COMING, SIR.

610
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,471
DEFLECTORS UP.

611
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:53,555
DEFLECTORS UP, SIR.

612
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,766
THE DEFLECTORS
WILL NOT STOP IT,
CAPTAIN.

613
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,225
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

614
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,519
WE SHOULD
HAVE SURMISED THIS.

615
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,187
FOR THE CREATURE
TO BE ABLE TO USE GRAVITY

616
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,439
AS A PROPULSIVE FORCE,

617
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,566
IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE
THIS CAPACITY.

618
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,860
5 SECONDS TO CONTACT.

619
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,194
ALL HATCHES
AND VENTS SECURE.

620
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,863
ALL LIGHTS ON THE BOARD
SHOW GREEN.

621
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,990
SIR! THE NUMBER 2
IMPULSE VENT--

622
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,199
WE HAVE A RED LIGHT.

623
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,624
CAPTAIN,
SOMETHING'S ENTERED

624
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,584
THROUGH THE NUMBER 2
IMPULSE VENT.

625
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:25,879
NEGATIVE PRESSURE
IN ALL SHIP'S VENTS.

626
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,840
ALERT ALL DECKS.

627
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,550
[BEEPING]

628
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:35,848
REPORT.

629
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:38,224
WHEN IT ENTERED
IMPULSE ENGINE
NUMBER 2's VENT,

630
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,102
IT ATTACKED 2 CREWMEN,
THEN GOT INTO THE
VENTILATING SYSTEM,

631
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,563
AND NOW WE HAVE AIR
FOR ONLY 2 HOURS.

632
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:44,397
BONES.

633
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,483
ONE MAN HAS A CHANCE
FOR SURVIVAL.

634
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,985
THE OTHER IS DEAD.

635
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,737
YOU CAN ADD THAT LITTLE
PRICE TAG TO YOUR MONSTER HUNT.

636
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:51,738
THAT'S ENOUGH, BONES.

637
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,198
IT'S NOT ENOUGH!

638
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,491
YOU DIDN'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENED

639
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,576
AS LONG AS YOU COULD
HANG YOUR TROPHY ON THE WALL.

640
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,537
WELL, IT'S NOT ON IT,
CAPTAIN, IT'S IN IT.

641
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,289
GENTLEMEN, MAY I SUGGEST
THAT WE NO LONGER
BELABOR THE QUESTION

642
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,042
OF WHETHER OR NOT
WE SHOULD HAVE GONE
AFTER THE CREATURE?

643
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,795
THE MATTER HAS BEEN
RENDERED ACADEMIC.

644
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,630
THE CREATURE IS NOW
AFTER US.

645
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,384
CREATURE, MR. SPOCK?

646
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,469
IT TURNED AND ATTACKED,
DOCTOR.

647
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,805
ITS METHOD
WAS WELL-CONSIDERED

648
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,639
AND INTELLIGENT.

649
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,022
YES, WELL,
IT COULD HAVE BEEN

650
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,815
MANY LIGHT-YEARS
AWAY FROM US.

651
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,235
INSTEAD IT CHOSE
TO TURN AND ATTACK
HERE. WHY?

652
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,528
IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL,
CAPTAIN,

653
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,989
UNTIL I CAN MAKE
A CLOSER SURVEY
OF THE CREATURE.

654
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,783
SCOTTY, TRY FLUSHING
THE RADIOACTIVE WASTE INTO
THE VENTILATION SYSTEM.

655
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,701
SEE WHAT EFFECT
THAT HAS.

656
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,411
AYE.

657
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,754
I'M SORRY, JIM.
I WAS WRONG.

658
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,676
CAPTAIN.

659
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,679
THE CREATURE'S ABILITY
TO THROW ITSELF
OUT OF TIME SYNC

660
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,974
MAKES IT POSSIBLE
FOR IT TO BE ELSEWHERE

661
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,976
IN THE INSTANT
THE PHASER HITS.

662
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,646
THERE IS THEREFORE NO BASIS
FOR YOUR SELF-RECRIMINATION.

663
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:11,610
IF YOU HAD FIRED, ON TIME
AND ON TARGET, 11 YEARS AGO,

664
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,236
IT WOULD HAVE MADE
NO MORE DIFFERENCE

665
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,363
THAN IT DID AN HOUR AGO.

666
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,825
CAPTAIN GARROVICK
WOULD STILL BE DEAD.

667
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,828
THE FAULT
WAS NOT YOURS, JIM.

668
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,664
IN FACT,
THERE WAS NO FAULT.

669
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,792
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY
ANALYST, SPOCK,

670
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,752
USE SOMEONE ELSE,
NOT ME.

671
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,337
MY CONCERN
IS WITH THE SHIP
AND THE CREW.

672
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,807
[BUZZER]

673
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,516
COME IN.

674
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,068
ENSIGN, AM I CORRECT
IN MY ASSUMPTION

675
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,319
THAT YOU'VE
BEEN DISTURBED

676
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,612
BY WHAT YOU CONSIDER
TO BE

677
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:56,655
A FAILURE
ON YOUR PART?

678
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,746
I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO CONSIDER

679
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,456
THAT THE HESITATION

680
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,583
FOR WHICH YOU ARE
BLAMING YOURSELF

681
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,336
IS AN HEREDITARY TRAIT
OF YOUR SPECIES.

682
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:15,966
WHEN SUDDENLY FACED
BY THE UNKNOWN
OR IMMINENT DANGER,

683
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,468
A HUMAN WILL INVARIABLY
EXPERIENCE

684
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,762
A SPLIT SECOND
OF INDECISION.

685
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,639
HE HESITATES.

686
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,644
DO I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, ENSIGN?

687
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,523
YES, SIR.

688
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,566
I KNOW YOU WOULD PREFER
TO WALLOW

689
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,819
IN A POOL OF EMOTION
RATHER THAN--

690
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:36,486
MR. SPOCK...

691
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,196
IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU
TO COME HERE--

692
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,783
KINDNESS, MR. GARROVICK,
IS ANOTHER HUMAN EMOTION,

693
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,036
AND I BELIEVE
WE HAVE ENOUGH OF THAT.

694
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,621
I SIMPLY WOULD LIKE YOU
TO ACCEPT THE FACT

695
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,415
THAT YOUR REACTION
HAS ITS BASIS IN PHYSIO--

696
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,544
DO YOU SMELL SOMETHING?

697
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,131
SIR, IT'S COMING
THROUGH THE VENT.

698
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,299
GET OUT OF HERE!
I'LL ATTEMPT TO
SEAL IT OFF.

699
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:18,111
SIR, THE CREATURE'S
IN MY CABIN.

700
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,154
IT'S GOT MR. SPOCK.

701
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,655
ON MY WAY, GARROVICK.

702
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,823
SECURITY TO 341.
MEDICAL ALERT.

703
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,534
SCOTTY, REVERSE
CABIN PRESSURE 341.

704
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,220
SECURITY, HOLD IT.

705
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,512
TRICORDER.

706
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,388
JIM, SPOCK
MAY BE DYING.

707
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,347
IF WE LET THAT THING
INTO THE SHIP,

708
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,225
HE'LL HAVE A LOT
OF COMPANY.

709
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,144
I MUST HAVE JAMMED
THE VENT CONTROL
WHEN I HIT IT.

710
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,520
SEE IF
THE REVERSE PRESSURE

711
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,647
HAS PULLED IT BACK INTO
THE VENTILATION SYSTEM.

712
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,150
HE SAVED MY LIFE,
CAPTAIN.

713
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,569
I SHOULD BE LYING DEAD
IN THERE, NOT HIM.

714
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,073
FORTUNATELY,
NEITHER OF US
IS DEAD, ENSIGN.

715
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,826
THE REVERSE
PRESSURE WORKED.
THE VENT IS CLOSED.

716
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,328
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND
MY NEXT QUESTION.

717
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:13,458
MR. SPOCK,
WHY AREN'T YOU DEAD?

718
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,836
IT'S THAT GREEN
BLOOD OF HIS.

719
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,881
My hemoglobin
is based on copper,
not iron.

720
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,174
I'LL BET HE LEFT
A BAD TASTE

721
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,468
IN THE
CREATURE'S
MOUTH, TOO.

722
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:26,805
COLLOQUIALLY EXPRESSED,
BUT ESSENTIALLY CORRECT.

723
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,306
YEAH.

724
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,225
[SNIFFS]

725
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,103
THE SCENT IS DIFFERENT.

726
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,605
I THINK I UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING NOW.

727
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,314
DO YOU BELIEVE
YOU'RE IN COMMUNICATION

728
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,774
WITH THE CREATURE,
CAPTAIN?

729
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,902
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS, MR. SPOCK,

730
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:46,324
BUT DO YOU REMEMBER I SAID
THE THING WAS ALIVE?

731
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,368
IT MAY NOT BE COMMUNICATION
AS WE UNDERSTAND IT,

732
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:57,418
BUT I DID KNOW
IT WAS ALIVE AND INTELLIGENT,

733
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,005
AND I THINK I KNOW
SOMETHING ELSE NOW.

734
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,547
[INTERCOM SIGNAL]

735
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,800

736
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,054

737
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,099

TOWARD THE NUMBER 2

741
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,939

MAY BE AFFECTING IT.

00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,732
OPEN THE VENT.
ON MY WAY TO THE BRIDGE.

ENSIGN GARROVICK.

745
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,240
YES, SIR.

746
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,997
YOU WERE ON THE BRIDGE
WHEN WE WERE ATTACKED.

747
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,623
YES, I'M SORRY, SIR.

748
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,334
I KNOW I WAS CONFINED
TO QUARTERS, BUT WHEN
THE ALERT SOUNDED--

749
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,919
VERY COMMENDABLE, ENSIGN.

750
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:43,381
WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION
OF THE BATTLE?

751
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,757
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND, SIR.

752
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,135
I'M ASKING FOR
YOUR MILITARY APPRAISAL

753
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,138
OF THE TECHNIQUES
USED AGAINST THE CREATURE.

754
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,639
INEFFECTIVE, CAPTAIN.

755
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,228
I REALIZE, CAPTAIN,
YOU DID EVERYTHING
YOU COULD DO.

756
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:58,146
I KNOW THAT.

757
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,522
IT'S JUST
THAT NOTHING WORKS
AGAINST A MONSTER

758
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:03,860
THAT CAN DO THE THINGS
THAT THING DOES.

759
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,280
AND, ENSIGN,
WHAT IS YOUR APPRAISAL
OF YOUR CONDUCT

760
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,656
ON THE PLANET?

761
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,326
I DELAYED FIRING.

762
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,913
AND IF YOU HADN'T
DELAYED FIRING...

763
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,748

764
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:21,044
NO DIFFERENCE, ENSIGN.

765
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:26,049
NO WEAPON KNOWN
WOULD HAVE MADE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

766
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,259
THEN...

00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,553

773
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,996

HAS LEFT THE SHIP
AT HIGH WARP SPEED

774
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,791
AND IS ALREADY NEARLY
OUT OF SCANNER RANGE.

775
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,084
THE WAY THAT THING
CAN MOVE, CAPTAIN,

776
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,752

BEGIN TO SHAKE APART.

782
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,434

WHERE IT'S GOING.

783
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,145
IT HAS CHANGED COURSE BEFORE
TO MISLEAD US, CAPTAIN.

784
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,146
LOGIC WOULD DICTATE--

785
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:24,107
NO. I'M PLAYING
INTUITION.

786
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:29,321

OPEN AND CLEAR, SIR.

793
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,706
INFORM THEM
THAT WE ARE PURSUING
THE CREATURE

794
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,959
TO PLANET 4
OF THAT SYSTEM.

795
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,505
THAT'S THE LOCATION
OF ITS ATTACK

796
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,508
ON THE U.S.S "FARRAGUT"
11 YEARS AGO.

797
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,634
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND,

798
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,303
IN GARROVICK'S QUARTERS,

799
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,097
I SAID THE SCENT
OF THE CREATURE
WAS SOMEHOW DIFFERENT.

800
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,725
SOMETHING IN MY MIND
SAID "HOME."

801
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,520
AND YOU KNOW
WHERE HOME IS, CAPTAIN?

802
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,230
YES, I THINK I DO.

803
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:07,566
I DON'T KNOW HOW I KNOW,
BUT HOME...

804
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:12,613
IS WHERE
IT FOUGHT A STARSHIP
ONCE BEFORE.

805
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,991
GIVE THEM
OUR TACTICAL SITUATION
AND INFORM THEM

806
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:18,536
I'M COMMITTING THIS VESSEL
TO THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE CREATURE.

807
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:22,123
WE WILL RENDEZVOUS--
ROUND-TRIP TIME,
MR. CHEKOV.

808
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,666
1.7 DAYS, SIR.

809
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,626
WE WILL RENDEZVOUS
WITH THE U.S.S. "YORKTOWN"...

810
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,339
IN 48 HOURS.

811
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,806
I ASSUME
THAT YOU NOW BELIEVE

812
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,059
WE SHOULD PURSUE
THE CREATURE
AND DESTROY IT.

813
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:41,934
PRECISELY.

814
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,436
YOU DON'T AGREE
WITH MR. SPOCK?

815
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,522
IT'S THE TIME FACTOR
THAT BOTHERS ME.

816
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,856
THOSE DRUGS ARE PERISHABLE.

817
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,441
DOCTOR,
EVIDENCE INDICATES

818
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,693
THE CREATURE IS HERE
TO SPAWN.

819
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,530
IF SO, IT WILL REPRODUCE
BY FISSION,

820
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,866
NOT JUST INTO TWO PARTS,
BUT THOUSANDS.

821
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,744
ANTIMATTER SEEMS
OUR ONLY POSSIBILITY.

822
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,329
AN OUNCE SHOULD
BE SUFFICIENT.

823
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:02,997
WE CAN DRAIN IT
FROM THE SHIP'S ENGINES,

824
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,041
TRANSPORT IT
TO THE PLANET'S SURFACE

825
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,085
IN A MAGNETIC
VACUUM FIELD.

826
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,169
CONTACT MEDICAL STORES.

827
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,380
I WANT AS MUCH HEMOPLASM
AS THEY CAN SPARE

828
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,048
IN THE TRANSPORTER ROOM
IN 15 MINUTES.

829
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,299
YES, SIR.

830
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,176
I PRESUME YOU INTEND TO USE
THAT HEMOPLASM

831
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,469
TO ATTRACT THE CREATURE?

832
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,595
WE MUST GET IT
TO THE ANTIMATTER.

833
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,597
IT SEEMS ATTRACTED
TO RED BLOOD CELLS.

834
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,473
WHAT BETTER BAIT
COULD WE HAVE?

835
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,976
THERE IS STILL
ONE PROBLEM, CAPTAIN.

836
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,061
THE BLAST, YES.

837
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,646
EXACTLY.
A MATTER/ANTIMATTER BLAST

838
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,275
WILL RIP AWAY
HALF THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE.

839
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,819
IF OUR VESSEL IS IN ORBIT
AND ENCOUNTERS
THOSE SHOCK WAVES--

840
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,572
A CHANCE WE'LL
HAVE TO TAKE, MR. SPOCK.

841
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,781
ALSO, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN

842
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,742
THE TRANSPORTER WILL OPERATE
UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS.

843
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,078
IF A MAN IS BEAMING UP
WHEN THAT HITS,

844
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,371
WE MAY LOSE HIM.

845
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,876
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
I'VE DECIDED
TO SET THE TRAP MYSELF.

846
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:54,632
CAPTAIN, THERE IS SO LITTLE
HEMOGLOBIN IN MY GREEN BLOOD,

847
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,343
THE CREATURE COULD NOT
HARM ME EXTENSIVELY.

848
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,512
IT THEREFORE SEEMS LOGICAL
FOR ME TO BE THE ONE--

849
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,931
NEGATIVE, MR. SPOCK.

850
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,725
IN CASE THIS PLAN FAILS,
I'LL NEED YOU ABOARD
THE SHIP.

851
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,769
IN THAT EVENT,
WE'LL NEED ANOTHER PLAN.

852
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,981
IT WILL REQUIRE TWO MEN
TO TRANSPORT
THE ANTIMATTER UNIT.

853
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,441
I'D LIKE PERMISSION
TO GO WITH YOU, SIR.

854
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,610
I HAD YOU IN MIND,
MR. GARROVICK.

855
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,454
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

856
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:25,622
SPOCK HERE, CAPTAIN.

857
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,957
PROCEED IMMEDIATELY
TO MAXIMUM ORBIT.

858
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,875
ACKNOWLEDGED.

859
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,551
JUST THINK, CAPTAIN,

860
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,471
LESS THAN ONE OUNCE
OF ANTIMATTER HERE

861
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,723
IS MORE POWERFUL
THAN 10,000
COBALT BOMBS.

862
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,559
LET'S HOPE IT'S AS POWERFUL
AS MAN WILL EVER GET.

863
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:54,691
DETONATOR.

864
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:55,610
AYE, SIR.

865
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,040
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

866
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:12,627
SPOCK HERE, CAPTAIN.
HOLDING AT 30,000
KILOMETERS.

867
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,795
ANTIMATTER CONTAINER
POSITIONED AND ARMED.

868
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,256
I'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN IT'S BAITED. KIRK OUT.

869
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,466
CAPTAIN, LOOK!

870
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,984
THE HEMOPLASM.

871
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,236
THE BAIT'S
ALREADY TAKEN.

872
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:41,406
WE'LL HAVE TO USE
SOMETHING ELSE FOR BAIT.

873
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,115
SIR, THAT THING
ONLY FEEDS ON BLOOD.

874
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,996
GARROVICK,
GET BACK TO THE SHIP.

875
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,875
TELL THEM TO PREPARE
TO DETONATE.

876
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,795
CAPTAIN,
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BE THE BAIT.

877
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,423
I SAID GET BACK TO THE SHIP.

878
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:02,968
ENSIGN,
I GAVE YOU AN ORDER.

879
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,178
YES, SIR.

880
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,900
CONSIDER YOURSELF
ON REPORT.

881
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,027
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR HEROICS.

882
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,405
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF SACRIFICING MYSELF,

883
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,615
AT LEAST NOT YET.

884
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,371
SPOCK...SPOCK.

885
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,830
SPOCK HERE.

886
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,418
SCAN US...

887
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:39,171
AND LOCK ONTO US.

888
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,757
IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE.

889
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,470
VERY, VERY CLOSE.
STAND BY.

890
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,350
STAND BY, "ENTERPRISE."

891
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,399
I CAN SMELL IT, CAPTAIN.

892
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,570
IT'S SICKENING.
HONEY SWEET.

893
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,659
STAND BY, "ENTERPRISE."

894
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,122
NOW!

895
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,749
ENERGIZE
AND DETONATE.

896
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:28,638
RESET.

897
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,057
ENERGIZE.

898
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,269
Chekov: ALL DECKS STAND BY.

899
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,479
SHOCK WAVES.

900
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:45,738
DO SOMETHING.

901
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,114
WE ARE, DOCTOR.

902
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,118
CROSS-CIRCUITING TO "A."

903
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,751
GOT THEM.
A PIECE OF THEM, ANYWAY.

904
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,840
CROSS-CIRCUITING TO "B."

905
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,425
CRAZY WAY TO TRAVEL,
SPREADING
A MAN'S MOLECULES

906
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:07,884
ALL OVER THE UNIVERSE.

907
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:30,449
CAPTAIN...
THANK HEAVEN.

908
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,202
MR. SCOTT, THERE WAS
NO DEITY INVOLVED.

909
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,497
IT WAS MY CROSS-CIRCUITING
TO "B" THAT RECOVERED THEM.

910
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:40,877
WELL, THEN,
THANK PITCHFORKS
AND POINTED EARS.

911
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,670
AS LONG
AS IT WORKED, JIM.

912
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,338
THAT'S A FAIR STATEMENT,
BONES.

913
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,340
NOW THAT
THE CREATURE IS DEAD,
LET'S SAVE SOME LIVES.

914
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,676
WE'LL DELIVER
YOUR MEDICINE.

915
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:49,886
BRIDGE, THIS IS KIRK.

916
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:50,803
UHURA HERE.

917
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,388
HAVE MR. CHEKOV
LAY IN A COURSE
FOR A RENDEZVOUS

918
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,557
WITH THE "YORKTOWN."
MAXIMUM WARP.

919
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,726
AYE, SIR.

920
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,143
OH, ENSIGN,

921
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,604
MEET ME IN MY QUARTERS
WHEN YOU'VE CLEANED UP.

922
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:02,981
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

923
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,443
SEVERAL...

924
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,027
TALL STORIES I THINK
YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR.

925
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,863
THANK YOU, SIR.

926
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,072
I WOULD.
