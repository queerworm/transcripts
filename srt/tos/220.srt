00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,593
THE READING'S GROWING
STRONGER, CAPTAIN.

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,847
COMING FROM A STAR SYSTEM
DIRECTLY AHEAD.

3
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,056
IT'S NOT
A SIGNAL, SIR.

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,559
IT DOES NOT SEEM
TO EVEN EXIST,

5
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:20,312
AND YET IT'S AFFECTING
ALL MY CHANNELS.

6
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,315
WELL?

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,651
SOMEONE OR SOMETHING

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,444
IS ATTEMPTING
TO ATTRACT OUR ATTENTION.

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,071
SOMEONE OR SOMETHING
HAS SUCCEEDED.

10
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,407
OUR DISTRESS SIGNAL RELAYS
HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED.

11
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,452
WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A DIRECTION
TO FOLLOW, BUT HOW?

12
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,954
WHAT'S CAUSING IT?

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,581
I DO NOT KNOW.

14
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,668
NOT EVEN A VULCAN CAN KNOW
THE UNKNOWN, CAPTAIN.

15
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,044
WE ARE HUNDREDS
OF LIGHT YEARS PAST

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,631
WHERE ANY EARTH SHIP
HAS EVER EXPLORED.

20
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,893
WITH TWO VERY IMPORTANT
EXCEPTIONS.

21
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:00,519
IT IS MUCH OLDER
THAN EARTH,

22
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,104
AND ABOUT A HALF MILLION
YEARS AGO,

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,858
ITS ATMOSPHERE
WAS TOTALLY RIPPED AWAY
BY SOME SORT OF CATACLYSM.

24
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,610
THE PLANET HAS EVIDENTLY
BEEN DEAD SINCE THEN.

25
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,112

OF ANY KIND.

26

<i>ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS</i>

27

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,957
NO, SIR.

<i>I AM SARGON.</i>

31
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,378

<i>WHICH HAS TOUCHED</i>
<i>YOUR INSTRUMENTS</i>

33

<i>AND DIRECTED YOU HERE.</i>

34
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,383
<i>NOW WITH</i>
<i>THIS CLOSER DISTANCE</i>

35
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,092
<i>I CAN SPEAK TO YOU</i>

36
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,887

37
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,430
<i>PLEASE ASSUME</i>

38
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,515
<i>ABOUT OUR PLANET,</i>

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,851
IS THAT A REQUEST OR DEMAND?

40
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,394
<i>THE CHOICE IS YOURS.</i>

41
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,480
<i>I READ WHAT</i>
<i>IS IN YOUR MIND.</i>

42
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:46,857
<i>WORDS ARE UNNECESSARY.</i>

43
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,901
THE PLANET IS DEAD.

44
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,111
THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY
OF LIFE THERE

45
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,863
AS WE UNDERSTAND LIFE.

46
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:57,325
<i>AND I AM AS DEAD</i>
<i>AS MY PLANET.</i>

47
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,080
<i>DOES THAT FRIGHTEN YOU,</i>
<i>JAMES KIRK?</i>

48
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,539
<i>FOR IF IT DOES,</i>

49
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,918
<i>IF YOU LET</i>
<i>WHAT IS LEFT OF ME PERISH,</i>

50
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,587
<i>THEN ALL OF YOU,</i>

51
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:13,550
<i>ALL OF MANKIND</i>
<i>MUST PERISH, TOO.</i>

52
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,401

<i>THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

53
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,620

59
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,468
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> IS IN ORBIT

WHOSE SURFACE,
OUR SENSORS TELL US,

61
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,430
IS DEVOID OF ALL LIFE,

62
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,432
A WORLD
DESTROYED AND DEAD

63
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,226
FOR AT LEAST
A HALF MILLION YEARS,

64
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,269
YET FROM IT
COMES A VOICE,

65
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,271
THE ENERGY
OF PURE THOUGHT,

66
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,025
TELLING US SOMETHING
HAS SURVIVED HERE

67
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,651
FOR THOSE THOUSANDS
OF CENTURIES.

68
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,278
SINCE EXPLORATION AND CONTACT
WITH ALIEN INTELLIGENCE

69
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,114
IS OUR PRIMARY MISSION,

70
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,617
I'VE DECIDED TO RISK
THE POTENTIAL DANGERS

71
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,619
AND RESUME CONTACT.

72

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,832
HOW LONG BEFORE

74
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,334
OVER THREE WEEKS

75
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,045
CAPTAIN.

76
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,215

DO WISH TO INSPECT
WHATEVER THIS IS

100

THAT LIVED
THAT LONG AGO.

101
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,653
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE MY SCIENCE
OFFICER WITH ME

102
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,947
ON SOMETHING
AS UNUSUAL AS THIS,

103
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,074
BUT IT IS
FULL OF UNKNOWNS,

104
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,202
AND WE CAN'T RISK
BOTH OF US BEING
OFF THE SHIP.

105
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,539

GONE, SIR.

106

PERHAPS THIS SARGON

108
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,507

109
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,301

111
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,680

112
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,019
WILL YOU TRANSPORT
DOWN WITH US,
MR. SPOCK?

113
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,352
EVIDENTLY, CAPTAIN.

114
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,605
MR. SULU,
YOU HAVE THE CON.

115
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,114
JIM, WHY NO
BRIEFING ON THIS?

116
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,615
I'D AT LEAST LIKE
TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE
GETTING INTO.

117
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,159
EASY. EASY, BONES.

118

AS LONG AS YOU KNOW
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING
DOWN THERE,

119
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,203
YOU KNOW

OF SOME SORT.

124
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,881

INSIDE SOLID ROCK.

125
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,300
INSIDE SOLID ROCK?

126
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,219
UNLIKELY.
THESE COORDINATES

127

I HAVE A FEELING
THAT THEY OR IT

130
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,728
COULD DESTROY US
JUST STANDING HERE

131
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,855
IF THEY OR IT
WANTED TO.

132
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,398

00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,833

137
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,627
BY WHOM?

138
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,383
STRANGE. I'M NOT SURE.

00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,970
WELL, I'M NOT
A LIAR, CAPTAIN.

140
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,306

TO REPORT HERE FOR DUTY.

141
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,474
I'M SURE
SHE DID, CAPTAIN,

142
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,770

149
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,293

AS LONG AS
YOU'RE GOING DOWN,

158
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,689

00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,324
ABOUT THE SAME TIME,
THE PLANET SURFACE
WAS DESTROYED,

177
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,368
IF OUR SENSOR READINGS
ARE ACCURATE.

178
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,285
COMPOSITION OF WALLS?

179
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,329
THEY'RE AN ALLOY
OR SUBSTANCE

180
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,746
COMPLETELY
UNKNOWN TO ME,

181
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,248
MUCH STRONGER AND HARDER

182
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,876
THAN ANYTHING
I'VE MEASURED BEFORE.

183
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,670
ALL READINGS ARE OFF
THE SCALE, CAPTAIN.

184
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,255
THE AIR SEEMS FRESH.

185
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,798
IT MUST BE
RECIRCULATED SOMEHOW.

186
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:13,136
IS THAT FOR US
OR DOES<i> IT</i> NEED
FRESH AIR?

187
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,320
<i>WELCOME.</i>

188
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,573
<i>I AM SARGON.</i>

189
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,330
SARGON...

190
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,874
WOULD IT HARM YOU
IF I...

191
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,252
<i>YOU MAY USE YOUR</i>
<i>TRICORDER, MR. SPOCK.</i>

192
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,712
<i>YOUR READINGS</i>
<i>WILL SHOW ENERGY</i>

193
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,339
<i>BUT NO SUBSTANCE.</i>

194
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,383
<i>SEALED IN</i>
<i>THIS RECEPTACLE</i>

195
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,177
<i>IS THE ESSENCE</i>
<i>OF MY MIND.</i>

196
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,389
PURE ENERGY.

197
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,890
MATTER WITHOUT FORM.

198
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,892
IMPOSSIBLE.

199
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,270
BUT YOU ONCE HAD
A BODY OF SOME TYPE?

200
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,646
<i>A BODY MUCH AS YOURS,</i>
<i>MY CHILDREN,</i>

201
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,149
<i>ALTHOUGH OUR MINDS WERE</i>
<i>INFINITELY GREATER.</i>

202
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,735
THAT'S TWICE YOU'VE
REFERRED TO US

203
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,237
AS "MY CHILDREN."

204
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,697
<i>BECAUSE IT IS POSSIBLE</i>
<i>YOU ARE OUR DESCENDANTS,</i>

205
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,199
<i>CAPTAIN KIRK.</i>

206
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,742
<i>SIX THOUSAND CENTURIES AGO,</i>

207
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,328
<i>OUR VESSELS WERE</i>
<i>COLONIZING THIS GALAXY,</i>

208
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,247
<i>JUST AS YOUR OWN STARSHIPS</i>

209
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,958
<i>HAVE NOW BEGUN TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>THAT VASTNESS.</i>

210
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,253
<i>AS YOU NOW LEAVE YOUR OWN SEED</i>
<i>ON DISTANT PLANETS,</i>

211
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,423
<i>SO WE LEFT</i>
<i>OUR SEED BEHIND US.</i>

212
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,468
<i>PERHAPS YOUR OWN LEGENDS</i>
<i>OF AN ADAM AND AN EVE</i>

213
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,010
<i>WERE TWO OF OUR TRAVELERS.</i>

214
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,346
OUR BELIEFS
AND OUR STUDIES

215
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,766
INDICATE THAT LIFE
ON OUR PLANET EARTH

216
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,768
EVOLVED INDEPENDENTLY.

217
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,353
THAT WOULD TEND, HOWEVER,

218
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,897
TO EXPLAIN CERTAIN ELEMENTS
OF VULCAN PREHISTORY.

219
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,609
<i>IN EITHER CASE,</i>
<i>I DO NOT KNOW.</i>

220
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,985
<i>IT WAS SO LONG AGO,</i>

221
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,238
<i>AND THE RECORDS OF OUR TRAVELS</i>
<i>WERE LOST IN THE CATACLYSM</i>

222
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,739
<i>WHICH WE LOOSENED</i>
<i>UPON OURSELVES.</i>

223
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,074
A WAR?

224
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,993
<i>A STRUGGLE FOR SUCH GOALS</i>

225
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,162
<i>AND THE UNLEASHING</i>
<i>OF SUCH POWER</i>

226
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,498
<i>THAT YOU COULD</i>
<i>NOT COMPREHEND.</i>

227
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,790
THEN PERHAPS
YOUR INTELLIGENCE

228
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,335
WASN'T SO GREAT, SARGON.

229
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,295
WE FACED
A SIMILAR CRISIS

230
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,964
IN OUR EARLY
NUCLEAR AGE.

231
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,216
WE FOUND THE WISDOM

232
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,884
NOT TO DESTROY
OURSELVES.

233
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,264
<i>AND WE SURVIVED</i>
<i>OUR PRIMITIVE</i>
<i>NUCLEAR ERA, MY SON.</i>

234
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,724
<i>BUT THERE COMES</i>
<i>TO ALL RACES</i>

235
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,352
<i>AN ULTIMATE CRISIS</i>

236
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,146
<i>WHICH YOU HAVE</i>
<i>YET TO FACE.</i>

237
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,650
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

238
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,862
<i>ONE DAY OUR MINDS</i>
<i>BECAME SO POWERFUL,</i>

239
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,533
<i>WE DARED THINK</i>
<i>OF OURSELVES AS GODS.</i>

240
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,746
YOU SAID
YOU WANTED OUR HELP.

241
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,624
WHAT IS IT YOU WISH?

242
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,844
JUST A MOMENT,
DOCTOR.

243
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:04,807
I...

244
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,767
AM...

245
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,436
SARGON.

246
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,649
WHERE'S OUR CAPTAIN?

247
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,025
WHERE'S JIM KIRK?

248
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,321
HE IS...UNHARMED.

249
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:24,994
I...HAVE TAKEN HIS BODY
TO DEMONSTRATE.

250
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,706
I WON'T
GO ALONG WITH THIS.

251
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,749
BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE,
SARGON,

252
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,335
OR WHATEVER YOU ARE.

253
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,961
AND IF HE REFUSES,
DOCTOR,

254
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,297
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE
TO DO WITH YOUR PHASER?

255
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,593
THAT IS STILL
JIM'S BODY.

256
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,568
LUNGS FILLED
WITH AIR AGAIN.

257
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,614
TO SEE AGAIN.

258
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,368
HEART...PUMPING.

259
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,623
ARTERIES SURGING
BLOOD AGAIN.

260
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,587
AFTER A HALF
A MILLION YEARS.

261
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,592
TO BE AGAIN.

262
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,349
YOUR CAPTAIN HAS AN
EXCELLENT BODY, DR. McCOY.

263
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,352
I COMPLIMENT YOU BOTH

264
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,606
ON THE CONDITION
IN WHICH YOU MAINTAINED IT.

265
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,319
WHAT ARE
YOUR PLANS FOR IT?

266
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,364
CAN YOU EXCHANGE PLACES
AGAIN WHEN YOU WISH?

267
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,365
HAVE NO FEAR.

268
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,285
YOUR CAPTAIN
IS QUITE UNHARMED,

269
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,455
ALTHOUGH
HIS MIND GENERATES
INSUFFICIENT ENERGY

270
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,751
FOR HIM TO SPEAK
FROM THERE AS I DO.

271
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,376
DOCTOR?

272
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,836
YES, I HAVE
THE SAME READINGS.

273
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,881
ARE YOU AWARE
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO HIS BODY--

274
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,134
HEART ACTION DOUBLED,
TEMPERATURE 104 DEGREES?

275
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,346
HE'LL DIE IF YOU DON'T
LEAVE HIS BODY SOON.

276
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,640
WHAT IS IT YOU
WANT OF US?

277
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,352
IN THE NEXT ROOM,

278
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,355
THERE ARE
OTHER RECEPTACLES--

279
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,942
THE OTHER TWO OF US
THAT SURVIVED.

280
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:24,947
YOU, DR. ANNE MULHALL,
AND YOU, MR. SPOCK,

281
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:29,035
WE REQUIRE
YOUR BODIES ALSO.

282
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,747
WE MUST HAVE
CAPTAIN KIRK...

283
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,582
AND YOU...

284
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,630
SO THAT
WE MAY LIVE AGAIN.

285
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:54,894
EVEN FOR US,

286
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,190
A HALF MILLION YEARS
WAS ALMOST TOO LONG
TO WAIT.

287
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,151
TWO OTHERS
STILL SURVIVE--

288
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,361
HENOCH...

289
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,366
AND THALASSA.

290
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,121
THALASSA,
MY THALASSA.

291
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,999
I AM PLEASED
YOU SURVIVED.

292
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,129
FORGIVE ME.

293
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,173
IT HAS BEEN
SO VERY LONG.

294
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,133
WHEN THE
STRUGGLE CAME

295
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,719
WHICH DEVASTATED
YOUR PLANET--

296
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,889
ONLY THE BEST MINDS
WERE CHOSEN
TO SURVIVE--

297
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,766
THALASSA,

298
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,268
MY WIFE, AS YOU
MAY HAVE GUESSED.

299
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,228
HENOCH,
FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

300
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,063
REALIZING
OUR MISTAKE,

301
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,108
WE ATTEMPTED
TO PERPETUATE
BOTH SIDES.

302
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,777
WE BUILT
THIS CHAMBER HERE

303
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:48,531
IN ORDER TO
PRESERVE OUR ESSENCE
IN THIS FASHION.

304
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,700
FASCINATING.

305
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:55,538
WE KNEW THE SEED
THAT WE HAD PLANTED
ON OTHER PLANETS

306
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,123
WOULD TAKE ROOT,

307
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,042
THAT ONE DAY YOU WOULD
BUILD VESSELS AS WE DID,

308
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,920
AND ONE DAY YOU WOULD
COME HERE.

309
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,087
THESE OTHERS,

310
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,131
THEY WERE STORED
DIFFERENTLY
THAN YOU,

311
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,716
BUT IT WAS
YOUR TASK

312
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,302
TO REMAIN
IN THE RECEPTACLE
OUT THERE...

313
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,263
AND SEARCH THE HEAVENS
WITH MY MIND,

314
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,767
PROBING, WAITING, PROBING.

315
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,186
AND THEN ONE DAY
MY MIND TOUCHED YOUR VESSEL

316
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,480
AND BROUGHT YOU HERE.

317
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,816
SO YOU COULD STEAL
OUR BODIES FROM US?

318
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,317
TO STEAL?

319
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,110
TO TAKE THEM FROM YOU?

320
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,738
NO, NO, MY CHILDREN,
YOU MISUNDERSTAND.

321
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:33,159
WE MEAN ONLY THAT YOU SHOULD
LEND US YOUR BODIES

322
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,911
FOR A SHORT TIME.

323
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,036
AND DESTROY THEM,

324
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,289
JUST AS YOU'RE BURNING
THAT ONE UP NOW.

325
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,124
HEARTBEAT--262, SPOCK.

326
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,543
ENTIRE METABOLIC RATE
CORRESPONDINGLY HIGH.

327
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,755
I WILL RETURN
YOUR CAPTAIN TO YOU

328
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,341
BEFORE THE BODY LIMIT
HAS BEEN REACHED.

329
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,717
OUR BODIES, SARGON,

330
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:50,844
FOR WHAT PURPOSE?

331
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,638
TO BUILD.

332
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,768
TO BUILD HUMANOID ROBOTS.

333
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,771
WE MUST BORROW YOUR BODIES
LONG ENOUGH

334
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,815
TO HAVE THE USE OF
YOUR HANDS, YOUR FINGERS.

335
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,109
THEN YOU INTEND
TO CONSTRUCT
MECHANICAL BODIES,

336
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,111
MOVE YOUR MINDS
INTO THEM,

337
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,114
AND THEN RETURN
OUR BODIES TO US.

338
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,658
WE HAVE ENGINEERS,
TECHNICIANS.

339
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,536
WHY CAN'T THEY BUILD
YOUR ROBOTS FOR YOU?

340
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:20,122
NO. OUR METHODS,
OUR SKILLS...

341
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:24,043
ARE FAR BEYOND
YOUR ABILITIES.

342
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,214
IT IS TIME.

343
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,988
IS IT YOU, JIM?

344
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,995
GOOD. HIS METABOLIC RATE
IS BACK TO NORMAL.

345
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,875
CAPTAIN, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED?

346
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,502
DO YOU REMEMBER
ANY PART OF IT?

347
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,880
YES. SARGON
BORROWED MY BODY.

348
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,425
I WAS FLOATING
IN TIME AND SPACE.

349
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,053
HE DOESN'T APPEAR
TO BE HARMED.

350
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,304
PHYSICALLY, ANYWAY.

351
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,932
SPOCK...

352
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,850
I REMEMBER.

353
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,896
WHEN SARGON AND I
EXCHANGED,

354
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,856
AS WE PASSED
EACH OTHER,

355
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:31,027
FOR AN INSTANT,
WE WERE ONE.

356
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,487
I KNOW HIM NOW.

357
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,449
I KNOW WHAT HE IS
AND WHAT HE WANTS,

358
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,284
AND I DON'T FEAR HIM.

359
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,495
THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS
STATEMENT I'VE EVER HEARD.

360
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,497
AN ALIEN PRACTICALLY
HIJACKS YOUR BODY

361
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,374
AND THEN CORKS YOU
INTO A BOTTLE, AND YOU--

362
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,460
I'M AFRAID THAT
I MUST AGREE
WITH DR. McCOY.

363
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:51,965
YOU COULD BE SUFFERING
FROM A FORM OF FALSE
EUPHORIA.

364
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,301
SARGON.

365
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,136
<i>I UNDERSTAND, MY SON.</i>

366
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,597
<i>GO TO YOUR VESSEL.</i>

367
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,516
<i>ALL WHO ARE INVOLVED</i>
<i>MUST AGREE TO THIS.</i>

368
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,476
<i>AFTER ALL THESE CENTURIES,</i>

369
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,020
<i>WE CAN WAIT</i>
<i>A FEW MORE HOURS.</i>

370
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,314
WHAT IF WE SHOULD
DECIDE AGAINST YOU?

371
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,858
<i>THEN YOU MAY GO</i>
<i>AS FREELY AS YOU CAME.</i>

372
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,570
YOU'RE GOING TO WHAT?

373
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,405
ARE THEY ALL RIGHT
IN THE HEAD, DOCTOR?

374
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,782
NO COMMENT.

375
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,742
A SIMPLE TRANSFERENCE--
THEIR MINDS AND OURS.

376
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,119
QUITE SIMPLE.
HAPPENS EVERY DAY.

377
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,287
SCOTTY, I NEED
YOUR APPROVAL, TOO,

378
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,081
SINCE YOU'LL BE
WORKING WITH THEM,

379
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,084
FURNISHING THEM ALL
THEY NEED TO MAKE
THE ANDROID ROBOTS.

380
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,293
YOU WON'T BE WORKING
WITH THEM.

381
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,544
YOU'LL BE WORKING
WITH US--OUR BODIES.

382
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,839
THEY'LL BE INSIDE US,
AND WE'LL BE--

383
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,674
IT ALL SEEMS
RATHER INDECENT TO ME.

384
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,135
I'M NOT SO CERTAIN
OF THAT, DOCTOR.

385
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,178
IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY
FASCINATING.

386
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:43,223
ONCE INSIDE THEIR
MECHANICAL BODIES,
ENGINEER,

387
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,643
THEY CAN
LEAVE THIS PLANET,

388
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,603
TRAVEL BACK WITH US.

389
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,690
WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE,
MANKIND COULD LEAP AHEAD
10,000 YEARS.

390
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,733
BONES, THEY'LL SHOW US
MEDICAL ADVANCES,

391
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,735
MIRACLES YOU NEVER
DREAMED POSSIBLE.

392
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:55,987
SCOTTY,
ENGINEERING ADVANCES--

393
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,571
VESSELS THIS SIZE

394
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,116
WITH ENGINES
THE SIZE OF WALNUTS.

395
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,161
ACH! YOU'RE JOKING.

396
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,079
NO, HE'S NOT.

397
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,414
THEY'RE GIANTS,
AND WE'RE INSECTS
BESIDE THEM.

398
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,959
THEY COULD DESTROY US
WITHOUT MEANING TO.

399
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,129
AND ALL HE WANTS
IS OUR CAPTAIN'S BODY

400
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,174
AND OUR
SECOND IN COMMAND, TOO.

401
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,591
COINCIDENCE?

402
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,553
THEY SELECTED US AS
THE MOST COMPATIBLE BODIES.

403
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:24,140
WHAT'S YOUR ATTITUDE
ON THAT, DOCTOR?

404
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:30,521
WELL, IF WE ALL AGREE,

405
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:35,359
I'M WILLING TO HOST
THALASSA'S MIND.

406
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,278
I'M A SCIENTIST.

407
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,281
THE OPPORTUNITY IS
AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE

408
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,994
FOR EXPERIMENTATION,
OBSERVATION.

409
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,040
A STARSHIP ENGINE
THE SIZE OF A WALNUT?

410
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,125
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

411
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,294
BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE
THERE'D BE ANY HARM

412
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,630
IN LOOKING OVER
DIAGRAMS ON IT.

413
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,842
BONES...

414
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,096
YOU COULD STOP ALL THIS
BY SAYING NO.

415
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:06,974
THAT'S WHY I CALLED YOU ALL
HERE TOGETHER.

416
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,687
WE'LL ALL BE
DEEPLY INVOLVED.

417
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,731
IT MUST BE
UNANIMOUS.

418
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,693
THEN I'LL STILL WANT
ONE QUESTION ANSWERED
TO MY SATISFACTION--

419
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,361
WHY?

420
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,907
NOT A LIST OF
POSSIBLE MIRACLES,

421
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:26,285
BUT A SIMPLE BASIC
UNDERSTANDABLE "WHY"

422
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,621
THAT OVERRIDES
ALL DANGER.

423
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,248
AND LET'S NOT
KID OURSELVES

424
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,292
THAT THERE IS
NO POTENTIAL DANGER
IN THIS.

425
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,796
THEY USED TO SAY

426
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,548
IF MAN COULD FLY,
HE'D HAVE WINGS.

427
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,175
BUT HE DID FLY.

428
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,385
HE DISCOVERED HE HAD TO.

429
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,223
DO YOU WISH THAT
THE FIRST APOLLO MISSION

430
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,433
HADN'T REACHED THE MOON

431
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,395
OR THAT WE HADN'T
GONE ON TO MARS AND
THEN TO THE NEAREST STAR?

432
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,275
THAT'S LIKE SAYING
YOU WISH THAT YOU STILL
OPERATED WITH SCALPELS

433
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,277
AND SEWED YOUR PATIENTS UP
WITH CATGUT

434
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,320
LIKE YOUR GREAT-
GREAT-GREAT-

435
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,614
GREAT-GRANDFATHER
USED TO.

436
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,327
I'M IN COMMAND.

437
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,621
I COULD ORDER THIS.

438
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,539
BUT I'M NOT...

439
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,336
BECAUSE...

440
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,922
DR. McCOY IS RIGHT

441
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:25,303
IN POINTING OUT
THE ENORMOUS DANGER POTENTIAL

442
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,388
IN ANY CONTACT WITH LIFE
AND INTELLIGENCE

443
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,309
AS FANTASTICALLY
ADVANCED AS THIS.

444
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,312
BUT I MUST POINT OUT
THAT THE POSSIBILITIES,

445
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,316
THE POTENTIAL FOR
KNOWLEDGE AND ADVANCEMENT

446
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,608
IS EQUALLY GREAT.

447
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,781
RISK.

448
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,284
RISK IS OUR BUSINESS.

449
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,287
THAT'S WHAT THIS STARSHIP
IS ALL ABOUT.

450
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:55,415
THAT'S WHY
WE'RE ABOARD HER.

451
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,633
YOU MAY DISSENT
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

452
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,307
DO I HEAR A NEGATIVE VOTE?

453
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,987
ENGINEER...

454
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:29,533
STAND BY TO BEAM ABOARD
THREE RECEPTACLES.

455
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,952
THE EXTREME POWER
OF THE ALIEN MIND

456
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,955
WILL DRIVE
THE HEART ACTION
DANGEROUSLY HIGH.

457
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,917
THE BODY FUNCTIONS
WILL RACE MANY TIMES
THEIR NORMAL METABOLISM,

458
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,878
SO WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO MONITOR THIS
VERY CAREFULLY.

459
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,755
YES, SIR.

460
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,800
WELL, I GUESS
WE'RE ABOUT AS READY
AS WE'LL EVER BE, JIM.

461
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,635
READY, SARGON.

462
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,798
THE TRANSFERENCE...

463
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,633
IS COMPLETE.

464
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,015
HMM...

465
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,643
METABOLIC RATE IS DOUBLED
AND RISING, DOCTOR.

466
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:42,648
HELLO.

467
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,403
OH, YOU ARE
A LOVELY FEMALE.

468
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:50,739
A PLEASANT SIGHT
TO WAKE UP TO

469
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,783
AFTER
HALF A MILLION YEARS.

470
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,327
THANK YOU.

471
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,661
YOU'RE WELCOME.

472
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,509
I'D FORGOTTEN
WHAT IT FELT LIKE...

473
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,515
EVEN TO BREATHE AGAIN.

474
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,527
SARGON?

475
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,122
HERE.

476
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,417
IN THIS BODY.

477
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:09,735
I AM NOT DISPLEASED,
MY HUSBAND.

478
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,572
YOUR BODY
IS NOT UNLIKE THAT
WHICH WAS YOUR OWN.

479
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,534
AND I, TOO...

480
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,663
AM PLEASED,
BELOVED.

481
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,420
AFTER SO LONG...

482
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,548
SO VERY LONG.

483
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,554
YES.

484
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,776
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BODY,
DOCTOR.

485
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:54,280
I SEEM TO HAVE RECEIVED
THE BEST OF THE THREE.

486
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,156
STRENGTH, HEARING,
EYESIGHT,

487
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,700
ALL FAR ABOVE
YOUR HUMAN NORMS.

488
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,787
I'M SURPRISED THE VULCANS
NEVER CONQUERED YOUR RACE.

489
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,164
VULCANS WORSHIP PEACE
ABOVE ALL, HENOCH.

490
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,585
YES, OF COURSE,
JUST AS WE DO, DOCTOR.

491
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,420
NURSE!

492
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,426
DOCTOR.

493
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,766
HENOCH, YOU'D BETTER
GET BACK TO BED, TOO.

494
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,850
IT WILL BE UNNECESSARY,
DOCTOR.

495
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,354
THIS VULCAN BODY
IS ACCUSTOMED TO
THE HIGHER METABOLISM.

496
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,731
SARGON, IT WON'T WORK.

497
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:33,152
YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT
BEFORE YOU KILL THEM!

498
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,321
WE WILL VACATE AT ONCE

499
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:38,865
UNTIL YOU CAN ADMINISTER
A METABOLIC REDUCTION
INJECTION.

500
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,367
A WHAT?

501
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:41,910
I'LL PREPARE
THE FORMULA, SARGON.

502
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,163
HENOCH...

503
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,623
YOUR CONDITION?

504
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,916
I CAN CONTINUE
IN THIS BODY
FOR SEVERAL HOURS.

505
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,170
FORTUNATE.

506
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,547
WE WILL...

507
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,008
VACATE AT ONCE.

508
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,815
THIS WOMAN WILL ASSIST ME.

509
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,445
YOU WILL TAKE ME TO
YOUR PHARMACOLOGY LABORATORY.

510
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,159
BONES...

511
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,160
WHAT...

512
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,453
IT WAS CLOSE, JIM.

513
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,205
YOU BOTH BARELY
GOT BACK ALIVE.

514
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,998
UNLESS THE FORMULA
WORKS,

515
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,583
WE CAN'T RISK IT
AGAIN.

516
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,755
NOW, THIS FORMULA WILL
REDUCE THE HEART ACTION

517
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,217
AND THE BODILY FUNCTIONS
TO NORMAL.

518
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,969
WHILE THE BODIES
ARE OCCUPIED,

519
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,847
YOU WILL ADMINISTER
ONE INJECTION OF 10ccs

520
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:44,973
EACH HOUR.

521
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:45,641
I UNDERSTAND.

522

00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,518
NO!

698
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:17,230
YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE
TO KEEP THE REAL BODY
ANY LONGER.

699
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,898
SARGON
WOULD'VE REQUIRED

700
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,399
THAT YOU ENTER
THE MECHANISM IMMEDIATELY.

701
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,528
I CANNOT LIVE
IN THAT<i> THING.</i>

702
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,333
DOCTOR.

703
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,625
YES?

704
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:46,301
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SAVE YOUR
CAPTAIN KIRK?

705
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,554
BUT YOU SAID
THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

706
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:01,941
WE HAVE MANY POWERS
SARGON DID NOT
PERMIT US TO USE.

707
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,152
HE THOUGHT THEM
TOO TEMPTING TO US.

708
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,946
THIS BODY PLEASES ME.

709
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,948
I INTEND TO KEEP IT.

710
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,533
I SEE.

711
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:16,164
AND HENOCH INTENDS
TO KEEP SPOCK'S BODY,
OF COURSE.

712
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,958
HENOCH'S PLANS
ARE HIS OWN AFFAIR.

713
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:23,338
I WISH ONLY TO EXIST
IN PEACE

714
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,090
AS A LIVING WOMAN.

715
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,925
IF YOU'RE
ASKING MY APPROVAL--

716
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,345
I REQUIRE ONLY
YOUR SILENCE.

717
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,931
ONLY YOU AND I
WILL KNOW

718
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,433
THAT DR. MULHALL
HAS NOT RETURNED
TO HER BODY.

719
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,561
ISN'T THAT WORTH
YOUR CAPTAIN'S LIFE?

720
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,608
DOCTOR...

721
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,446
WE CAN TAKE
WHAT WE WISH.

722
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:51,866
NEITHER YOU,
THIS SHIP,

723
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,702
NOR ALL YOUR WORLDS
HAVE THE POWER
TO STOP US.

724
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,247
NEITHER JIM NOR I
CAN TRADE A BODY
WE DON'T OWN.

725
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,124
IT HAPPENS TO BELONG
TO A YOUNG WOMAN.

726
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:02,294
WHO YOU HARDLY KNOW.

727
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:04,296
ALMOST A STRANGER
TO YOU.

728
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,631
I WILL NOT
PEDDLE FLESH!

729
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,967
I'M A PHYSICIAN.

730
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,428
A PHYSICIAN?

731
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,306
IN CONTRAST
TO WHAT WE ARE,

732
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:19,769
YOU ARE A PRANCING,
SAVAGE MEDICINE MAN.

733
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,313
YOU DARE DEFY ONE

734
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:24,941
YOU SHOULD BE
ON YOUR KNEES
WORSHIPPING?

735
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:28,778
I COULD DESTROY YOU
WITH A SINGLE THOUGHT.

736
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,707
STOP!

737
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,677
SARGON WAS RIGHT.

738
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:56,555
TEMPTATIONS WITHIN
A LIVING BODY ARE TOO GREAT.

739
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,932
FORGIVE ME.

740
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,227
<i>I AM PLEASED,</i>
<i>MY BELOVED.</i>

741
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:04,522
<i>IT IS GOOD YOU HAVE</i>
<i>FOUND THE TRUTH YOURSELF.</i>

742
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,358
SARGON?

743
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,112
WHERE ARE YOU?

744
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,282
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
DESTROYED BY HENOCH.

745
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,994
<i>I HAVE POWER EVEN HENOCH</i>
<i>DOES NOT SUSPECT, BELOVED.</i>

746
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,540
YES.

747
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,168
YES, I SEE.

748
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,169
I...

749
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,004
I UNDERSTAND.

750
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:36,137
JUST AS WE WOULD HAVE
PLACED OUR CONSCIOUSNESS
WITHIN ROBOTS,

751
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:41,017
SARGON HAS PLACED HIS
INTO YOUR VESSEL.

752
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,145
DOCTOR.

753
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,315
DOCTOR,
LEAVE US.

754
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,651
SARGON HAS A PLAN.
WE HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO.

755
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,554
THIS IS SICKBAY.
GET ME--

756
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:23,560
NURSE CHAPEL,
WHAT IN THE DEVIL--

757
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,950
JIM?

758
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,077
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

759
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,330
YES, I'M FINE,
BONES.

760
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,754
THALASSA?

761
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,507
SHE IS...
NOW WITH SARGON, DOCTOR.

762
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,091
I...

763
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,135
I'M ANNE MULHALL,

764
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,345
BACK IN MY OWN BODY.

765
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,234
JIM, THE RECEPTACLES!

766
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,362
SPOCK'S CONSCIOUSNESS
WAS IN ONE OF THEM.

767
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:18,072
IT WAS NECESSARY.

768
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,074
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

769
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,620
THERE IS NO SPOCK
TO RETURN TO HIS BODY.

770
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,497
YOU'VE KILLED
A LOYAL OFFICER,

771
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:27,332
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

772
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:28,666
BONES, PREPARE A HYPO--

773
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,835
THE FASTEST,
DEADLIEST POISON
TO VULCANS.

774
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,962
SPOCK'S CONSCIOUSNESS
IS GONE.

775
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,008
WE MUST KILL HIS BODY,

776
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,926
THE<i> THING</i> IN IT.

777
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,346
AAH!

778
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:55,443
MUST I MAKE AN EXAMPLE
OF YOU, TOO, HELM?

779
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,197
PAIN, CAPTAIN?

780
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,868
AND YOU, MY DEAR?

781
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,707
FORTUNATELY, DOCTOR,

782
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:15,129
I KNOW EVERY THOUGHT
OF EVERY MIND AROUND ME.

783
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,214
SEE?

784
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,633
TAKE THE HYPO FROM HIM.

785
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,723
AND INJECT HIM
WITH IT.

786
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:40,530
YOU FOOLS.

787
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:44,492
I'LL SIMPLY TRANSFER
TO ANOTHER PLACE,

788
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,952
ANOTHER BODY.

789
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,332
SARGON!

790
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,502
NO, SARGON, PLEASE.

791
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,337
LET ME...

792
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,423
LET ME...

793
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,341
TRANSFER...

794
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,940
SPOCK.

795
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,945
MY FRIEND SPOCK.

796
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,324
IF THERE'D ONLY BEEN
ANOTHER WAY.

797
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:29,078
<i>I COULD NOT ALLOW</i>
<i>YOUR SACRIFICE</i>

798
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,956
<i>OF ONE SO CLOSE TO YOU.</i>

799
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:42,967
JIM.

800
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,096
YOU'RE ALIVE.

801
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,140
THERE WAS ENOUGH POISON
IN THAT HYPO

802
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,100
TO KILL 10 VULCANS.

803
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,226
<i>NO, DOCTOR,</i>

804
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,645
<i>I ALLOWED YOU TO</i>
<i>BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE</i>

805
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,105
<i>SO THAT HENOCH WOULD</i>
<i>READ YOUR THOUGHTS</i>

806
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,023
<i>AND BELIEVE IT ALSO.</i>

807
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,150
SARGON.

808
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:00,735
IT SEEMS, DOCTOR,
THE INJECTION

809
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,696
WAS ONLY ENOUGH TO
CAUSE UNCONSCIOUSNESS.

810
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,115
<i>BUT HENOCH BELIEVED</i>
<i>AND FLED THE BODY.</i>

811
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,075
<i>HE IS DESTROYED.</i>

812
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,328
BUT YOUR VESSEL
WAS DESTROYED, TOO.

813
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,288
WHERE WAS YOUR
CONSCIOUSNESS KEPT?

814
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:16,417
THE PLACE HENOCH WOULD
LEAST SUSPECT, CAPTAIN.

815
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:21,673
THAT IS WHY
I WAS SUMMONED TO
THE SICKBAY, DOCTOR.

816
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:25,050
MR. SPOCK'S
CONSCIOUSNESS
WAS PLACED IN ME.

817
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,678
WE SHARED
CONSCIOUSNESS
TOGETHER.

818
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:29,639
<i>WE NOW KNOW</i>
<i>WE CANNOT PERMIT OURSELVES</i>

819
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:33,267
<i>TO EXIST IN YOUR WORLD,</i>
<i>MY CHILDREN.</i>

820
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,979
<i>THALASSA AND I MUST NOW</i>
<i>ALSO DEPART INTO OBLIVION.</i>

821
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:41,442
IS THERE ANY WAY
WE CAN HELP YOU, SARGON?

822
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,985
<i>YES, MY SON.</i>

823
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,070
<i>YOU CAN ALLOW</i>
<i>THALASSA AND ME</i>

824
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,072
<i>TO SHARE YOUR BODIES AGAIN.</i>

825
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,284
<i>A LAST MOMENT TOGETHER.</i>

826
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:19,146
OBLIVION TOGETHER
DOES NOT FRIGHTEN ME,
BELOVED.

827
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:24,985
PROMISE
WE'LL BE TOGETHER.

828
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,488
I PROMISE...

829
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,073
BELOVED.

830
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:31,283
TOGETHER FOREVER.

831
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:36,121
FOREVER...BELOVED.

832
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,956
FOREVER.

833
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,728
WELL,
I'M SURE THAT, UH...

834
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:03,482
SARGON APPRECIATED
YOUR COOPERATION,
DR. MULHALL.

835
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,150
YES. I WAS, UH...

836
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,987
HAPPY TO COOPERATE,
CAPTAIN.

837
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,452
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
