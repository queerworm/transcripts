1
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:06,882
STANDARD ORBIT, CAPTAIN.

2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:07,758
NOT NOW, LESLIE.

3
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,885
LIEUTENANT,
CONTACT THE SPACE STATION.

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,762
CAPTAIN, THE STATION
IS CALLING US.

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,931
ALL RIGHT. PUT THEM ON.

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,808
Captain Kirk,
this is Commodore Enright.

7
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,810
YES, COMMODORE.
I'D LIKE AN EXPLANATION.

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,270
The explanation
is beaming aboard now, Captain.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,107
He may already be
in your transporter room.

10
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,317
SPOCK.

11
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:39,874
BOB.

12
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:40,749
ARE YOU SURPRISED?

13
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,334
I'LL SAY.
SPOCK, THIS IS--

14
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,461
COMMODORE WESLEY.
HOW DO YOU DO, SIR?

15
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,713
MR. SPOCK.

16
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,172
ALL RIGHT, ENSIGN.
YOU CAN GO.

17
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,258
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

18
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,636
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

19
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,221
I RECEIVE ORDERS
TO PROCEED HERE.

20
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,055
NO REASON GIVEN.

21
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,932
I'M INFORMED THAT MY MEN
WILL BE REMOVED

22
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,267
TO THE SPACE STATION,
TO A SECURITY HOLDING AREA.

23
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,102
I THINK I'M ENTITLED
TO AN EXPLANATION.

24
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,731
YOU'VE HAD A SINGULAR HONOR
CONFERRED ON YOU, JIM.

25
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,357
YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE FOX IN THE HUNT.

26
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,942
WHAT'S THAT?

27
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,443
WAR GAMES.

28
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,405
I'LL BE COMMANDING
THE ATTACK FORCE AGAINST YOU.

29
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,949
AN ENTIRE ATTACK FORCE
AGAINST MY SHIP?

30
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,244
HAVE YOU HEARD
OF THE M-5 MULTITRONIC UNIT?

31
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:22,457
THAT'S DR. RICHARD DAYSTROM'S
DEVICE, ISN'T IT?

32
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,375
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

33
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,378
THE MOST AMBITIOUS
COMPUTER COMPLEX EVER CREATED.

34
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,881
ITS PURPOSE IS TO CORRELATE
ALL COMPUTER ACTIVITY

35
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,298
ABOARD A STARSHIP,

36
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:34,511
TO PROVIDE THE ULTIMATE
IN VESSEL OPERATION AND CONTROL.

37
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,389
HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT IT, COMMANDER?

38
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,225
I HOLD AN A-7
COMPUTER EXPERT CLASSIFICATION,

39
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,060
COMMODORE.

40
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,186
I'M WELL ACQUAINTED
WITH DR. DAYSTROM'S THEORIES

41
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,229
AND DISCOVERIES.

42
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,523
THE BASIC DESIGN
OF ALL OUR SHIP'S COMPUTERS

43
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,233
ARE DR. DAYSTROM'S.

44
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,778
BUT WHAT HAS ALL THIS GOT TO DO
WITH THE ENTERPRISE, COMMODORE?

45
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,988
YOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN
TO TEST THE M-5, JIM.

46
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,740
THERE'LL BE A SERIES
OF ROUTINE RESEARCH

47
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,325
AND CONTACT PROBLEMS
FOR THE M-5 TO SOLVE,

48
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,996
PLUS NAVIGATIONAL MANEUVERS
AND THE WAR GAMES PROBLEM.

49
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,373
NOW, IF THE M-5 WORKS
UNDER ACTUAL CONDITIONS,

50
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,042
AS WELL AS IT HAS
UNDER SIMULATED TESTS,

51
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,253
IT WILL MEAN A REVOLUTION
IN SPACE TECHNOLOGY

52
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,546
AS GREAT AS WARP DRIVE.

53
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,549
WHEN YOUR CREW HAS BEEN REMOVED,
THE SHIP'S ENGINEERING SECTION

54
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,302
WILL BE MODIFIED
TO CONTAIN THE COMPUTER.

55
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,720
WHY REMOVE MY CREW?

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,681
THEY'RE NOT NEEDED.

57
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,392
HOW MUCH SECURITY
DOES THIS GADGET REQUIRE?

58
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,145
NONE.

59
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,522
DR. DAYSTROM WILL SEE
TO THE INSTALLATION HIMSELF,

60
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,983
AND HE'LL SUPERVISE THE TESTS.

61
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,358
WHEN HE'S READY
YOU'LL RECEIVE YOUR ORDERS

62
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,988
AND PROCEED ON THE MISSION
WITH A CREW OF 20.

63
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,283
TWENTY?

64
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,619
I CAN'T RUN A STARSHIP
WITH 20 CREW.

65
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,121
THE M-5 CAN.

66
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,832
AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

67
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,125
YOU GOT A GREAT JOB, JIM.

68
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:50,879
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SIT BACK
AND LET THE MACHINE DO THE WORK.

69
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,855
SPACE, THE FINAL FRONTIER.

70
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:18,782
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE.

71
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,199
ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION:

72
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,287
TO EXPLORE STRANGE NEW WORLDS,
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE

73
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,581
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,

74
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,251
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN
HAS GONE BEFORE.

75
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,503
CAPTAIN'S LOG, STARDATE 4729.4.

76
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,380
THE M-5 COMPUTER
HAS BEEN INSTALLED

77
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,840
ONBOARD SHIP AND WE HAVE LEFT

78
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,093
THE SPACE STATION
FOR TEST MANEUVERS.

79
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,468
I DON'T LIKE IT, JIM.

80
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,388
A VESSEL THIS SIZE CANNOT BE RUN
BY ONE COMPUTER.

81
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,599
THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO PROVE
THAT IT CAN RUN THIS SHIP

82
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,434
MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN MAN.

83
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,519
MAYBE YOU'RE TRYING
TO PROVE THAT, SPOCK,

84
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,772
BUT DON'T COUNT ME IN ON IT.

85
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,316
THE MOST UNFORTUNATE LACK
IN CURRENT COMPUTER PROGRAMMING

86
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,693
IS THAT THERE
IS NOTHING AVAILABLE

87
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,739
TO IMMEDIATELY REPLACE
THE STARSHIP SURGEON.

88
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,951
VERY FUNNY.

89
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,245
IF IT COULD, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
TO REPLACE ME.

90
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,705
I'D RESIGN
BECAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE ABOARD

91
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,374
WOULD BE NOTHING
BUT CIRCUITS AND MEMORY BANKS.

92
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,627
YOU KNOW THE TYPE, SPOCK.

93
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,378
JIM, YOU HAVEN'T HAD MUCH
TO SAY ABOUT THIS.

94
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,797
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

95
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,674
M-5. IT'S AN HONOR,
THEY TELL ME.

96
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,927
WELL, I'M HONORED.

97
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,306
WHERE IS HE?

98
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,474
SCOTTY, WHERE'S DR. DAYSTROM?

99
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,602
WELL, HE WAS HERE.
DOCTOR?

100
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,481
YES?

101
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,066
AH, YOU'D BE CAPTAIN KIRK.

102
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,109
YES, DR. DAYSTROM.

103
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,320
THIS IS MY FIRST OFFICER,
MR. SPOCK.

104
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,863
I AM HONORED, DOCTOR.

105
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,323
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

106
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,285
CAPTAIN, I HAVE FINISHED
MY TESTS ON THE M-5,

107
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,829
AND IT MUST BE HOOKED
INTO YOUR MAIN POWER PLANTS

108
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,747
IN ORDER TO BE OPERATIVE.

109
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,833
WELL, I ALWAYS DO SO.

110
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,793
YOUR ENGINEER THERE
WOULDN'T ALLOW US

111
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,838
THE POWER NECESSARY
WITHOUT YOUR ORDERS.

112
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,048
MR. SCOTT, HOOK IN
THE MULTITRONIC UNIT

113
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,925
TO THE SHIP'S MAIN POWER BANKS.

114
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,135
AYE AYE, SIR.

115
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,511
MR. ARTHUR.

116
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,344
FASCINATING, DOCTOR.

117
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,514
THIS COMPUTER HAS A POTENTIAL
BEYOND ANYTHING

118
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,974
YOU'VE EVER DONE.

119
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,517
EVEN YOUR BREAKTHROUGH
IN DUOTRONICS

120
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,727
DID NOT HAVE THE PROMISE
OF THIS.

121
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,272
THE M-5 HAS BEEN PERFECTED,
COMMANDER.

122
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,232
ITS POTENTIAL IS A FACT.

123
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,400
FRANKLY, THE ONLY FACT
THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

124
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,986
IS IF THIS THING DOESN'T WORK,

125
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,197
THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH MEN ABOARD
TO RUN THIS SHIP,

126
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,823
AND THAT'S BEGGING FOR TROUBLE.

127
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,159
NOW, WHO IS THIS?

128
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:11,246
DR. LEONARD McCOY,
SENIOR MEDICAL OFFICER.

129
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,915
I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS IS A SECURITY AREA.

130
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,042
I WOULDN'T WORRY, DOCTOR.

131
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,460
DR. McCOY HAS CLEARANCE
THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.

132
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,004
[ BEEPING ]

133
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,178
IS IT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

134
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,386
IF I CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE,
DOCTOR?

135
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,015
NO, NO, NO, THANK YOU.
I CAN MANAGE.

136
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,394
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG,
CAPTAIN,

137
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:39,524
JUST A FEW MINOR
SETTLING IN ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE.

138
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,736
AS YOU CAN SEE,
ALL IS IN ORDER NOW.

139
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,780
I'M CURIOUS, DOCTOR,
WHY IS IT CALLED M-5

140
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,532
AND NOT M-1?

141
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,035
WELL, YOU SEE,
THE MULTITRONIC UNITS

142
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,747
ONE THROUGH FOUR
WERE NOT ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL.

143
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,249
THIS ONE IS.

144
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,126
M-5 IS READY TO TAKE CONTROL
OF THE SHIP.

145
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,961
TOTAL CONTROL?

146
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,673
THAT IS WHAT IT WAS
DESIGNED FOR, CAPTAIN.

147
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:08,845
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
MEN MUST DO TO REMAIN MEN.

148
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,224
YOUR COMPUTER
WOULD TAKE THAT AWAY.

149
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:15,060
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
A MAN LIKE YOU MIGHT DO,

150
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,312
OR PERHAPS YOU OBJECT
TO THE POSSIBLE LOSS

151
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,314
OF THE PRESTIGE
AND THE CEREMONY

152
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,358
ACCORDED A STARSHIP CAPTAIN.

153
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,444
THE COMPUTER CAN DO YOUR JOB
AND WITHOUT ALL THAT.

154
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,072
YOU'LL HAVE TO PROVE
THAT TO ME, DOCTOR.

155
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,908
THAT IS WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR,
ISN'T IT, CAPTAIN?

156
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,089
DID YOU SEE THE LOVE LIGHT
IN SPOCK'S EYES?

157
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,842
THE RIGHT COMPUTER
FINALLY CAME ALONG.

158
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,178
WHAT'S THE MATTER, JIM?

159
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:54,433
I THINK THAT THING IS WRONG,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

160
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,643
WELL, I THINK IT'S WRONG, TOO,
REPLACING MEN

161
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,894
WITH MINDLESS MACHINES.

162
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,646
MM-MM, I DON'T MEAN THAT.

163
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:04,443
I'M GETTING A RED ALERT
RIGHT HERE.

164
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,903
THAT THING IS DANGEROUS.

165
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:11,199
I FEEL--

166
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,534
ONLY A FOOL WOULD STAND
IN THE WAY OF PROGRESS,

167
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,703
IF THIS IS PROGRESS.

168
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,664
YOU HAVE
MY PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES.

169
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:24,045
AM I AFRAID OF LOSING MY JOB
TO THAT COMPUTER?

170
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,924
JIM, WE'VE ALL SEEN THE ADVANCES
OF MECHANIZATION.

171
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,594
AFTER ALL, DAYSTROM DID DESIGN
THE COMPUTER TO RUN THIS SHIP.

172
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,763
UNDER HUMAN CONTROL.

173
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,265
WE'RE ALL SORRY

WHEN HE LOSES HIS JOB
TO A MACHINE.

175
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,270
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR JOB,
THAT'S DIFFERENT,

176
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,107
AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE DIFFERENT.

177
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:48,736
AM I AFRAID OF LOSING COMMAND
TO A COMPUTER?

178
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,530
DAYSTROM WAS RIGHT.
I CAN DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS.

179
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,658
AM I AFRAID OF LOSING
THE PRESTIGE AND THE POWER

180
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,660
THAT GOES WITH BEING
A STARSHIP CAPTAIN?

181
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,330
IS THAT WHY I'M FIGHTING?
AM I THAT PETTY?

182
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,249
JIM, IF YOU HAVE THE AWARENESS
TO ASK YOURSELF THAT QUESTION,

183
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,543
YOU DON'T NEED ME TO ANSWER IT
FOR YOU.

184
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:08,382
WHY DON'T YOU ASK JAMES T. KIRK?
HE'S A PRETTY HONEST GUY.

ADMIRABLY SO FAR.

188
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,902
ALL IT'S DONE IS MAKE
THE REQUIRED COURSE CHANGES

189

IS THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT.

IT WON'T BE NECESSARY

OF THE UNIT

COULD HAVE BROUGHT US HERE

AS EASILY AS THE NAVIGATOR.

205
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,946

A FURTHER DEMONSTRATION

TO DO MORE WORK,

300
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,329
IT PULLS MORE POWER TO ENABLE IT
TO DO WHAT IS REQUIRED OF IT,

301
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,082
JUST AS THE HUMAN BODY
DRAWS MORE ENERGY

IN THE WAY, I THINK.

HOW THE COMPUTER WOULD PERFORM.

HAS NOT BEHAVED LOGICALLY.

TO ITS SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS.

563

IF ITS MIND DEVELOPS PROPERLY,

TO ALL OF US.

NO. WE'RE INVINCIBLE.

860
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,680
LOOK WHAT WE'VE DONE.

861
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,352
YOUR MIGHTY STARSHIPS, WAR TOYS
TO BE CRUSHED AS WE CHOOSE.

862
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,690
SECURITY, TAKE HIM TO SICK BAY.

863
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:52,695
FASCINATING.

864
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,198
TAKE CARE OF HIM, DOCTOR.

865
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,615
VITAL STATS.

866
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,825
THE OTHER THREE SHIPS
ARE HOLDING STATION

867
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,411
OUT OF RANGE.

868
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,579
THE EXCALIBUR LOOKS DEAD.

869
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:06,834
CAPTAIN, LEXINGTON
IS RECEIVING A MESSAGE

870
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,044
FROM STARFLEET.

871
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,587
THEY...

872
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,672
GO ON.

873
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,467
You are authorized
to use all measures available

874
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,677
to destroy the Enterprise.

875
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,179
Acknowledge, Lexington.

876
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,848
Acknowledged. Lexington out.

877
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,017
THEY'VE JUST SIGNED
THEIR OWN DEATH WARRANT.

878
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,270
M-5 WILL KILL THEM TO SURVIVE.

879
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,147
EVERY LIVING THING
WANTS TO SURVIVE, CAPTAIN.

880
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,942
DAYSTROM MUST HAVE IMPRESSED
THAT INSTINCTIVE REACTION

881
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,818
UPON THE COMPUTER.

882
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,696
SUPPOSE IT'S STILL OPEN
TO IMPRESSION,

883
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,242
SUPPOSE IT ABSORBED THE REGRET
DAYSTROM FELT

884
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,911
FOR THE DEATHS IT CAUSED,
THE GUILT.

885
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:45,582
CAPTAIN, THE SHIPS
ARE COMING WITHIN RANGE AGAIN.

886
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,253
COMMODORE WESLEY
IS A DEDICATED COMMANDER.

887
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,838
I SHOULD REGRET SERVING ABOARD
THE INSTRUMENT OF HIS DEATH.

888
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,632
THE INSTRUMENT OF HIS DEATH
WILL NOT BE THE ENTERPRISE

889
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,342
IF I CAN HELP IT.

890
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,677
M-5, TIE IN.

891
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,762
M-5.

892
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,599
THIS IS CAPTAIN KIRK.

893
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,976
YOU WILL BE UNDER ATTACK
IN A MOMENT.

894
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,186
Sensors have recorded
approaching ships.

895
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,647
YOU HAVE ALREADY RENDERED
ONE STARSHIP EITHER DEAD

896
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,149
OR HOPELESSLY CRIPPLED.

897
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,775
MANY LIVES WERE LOST.

898
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:17,655
The ships attacked this unit.
This unit must survive.

899
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,864
WHY?

900
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,283
This unit is the ultimate
achievement

901
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:21,826
in computer evolution.

902
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:24,120
It will replace man
so man may achieve.

903
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,040
Man must not risk death in space
or other dangerous occupations.

904
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,253
This unit must survive
so man may be protected.

905
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:37,675
CAPTAIN, ATTACK FORCE
ALMOST WITHIN PHASER RANGE.

906
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,885
THERE WERE MANY MEN
ABOARD THOSE SHIPS.

907
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:45,016
THEY WERE MURDERED.
MUST YOU SURVIVE BY MURDER?

908
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:48,603
This unit cannot murder.

909
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:49,521
WHY?

910
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:53,483
Murder is contrary
to the laws of man and God.

911
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:56,277
BUT YOU HAVE MURDERED.

912
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,322
SCAN THE STARSHIP EXCALIBUR,
WHICH YOU DESTROYED.

913
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,740
IS THERE LIFE ABOARD?

914
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,699
No life.

915
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:07,372
BECAUSE YOU MURDERED IT.

916
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:11,459
WHAT IS THE PENALTY FOR MURDER?

917
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,586
Death.

918
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,339
AND HOW WILL YOU PAY

919
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,007
FOR YOUR ACTS OF MURDER?

920
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,722
Must die.

921
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,062
M-5?

922
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:35,233
SIR, DETECTOR SHIELDS
HAVE DROPPED.

923
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,696
ALL PHASER POWER GONE, SIR.

924
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:42,739
M-5 IS LEAVING ITSELF OPEN
TO ATTACK.

925
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,409
THE MACHINE
IS COMMITTING SUICIDE

926
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,536
TO ATONE FOR THE SIN OF MURDER.

927
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:48,496
SCOTTY, SPOCK,
BEFORE IT CHANGES ITS MIND,

928
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,456
GO DOWN TO ENGINEERING
AND PULL OUT EVERY HOOK-UP

929
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,957
THAT MAKES M-5 RUN.

930
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:55,169
PULL OUT THE PLUG, SPOCK.

931
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:56,713
LIEUTENANT?

932
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:57,880
AYE, SIR.

933
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,633
ENTER SHIP'S COMMUNICATIONS.

934
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,095
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN SPEAKING.

935
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,556
IN APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE

936
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:11,310
WE'LL BE ATTACKED
BY FEDERATION STARSHIPS.

937
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,020
THE M-5 NO LONGER CONTROLS
THE SHIP,

938
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,690
BUT THEN NEITHER DO WE
CONTROL IT.

939
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:20,986
THE M-5 HAS LEFT ITSELF AND US
OPEN FOR DESTRUCTION.

940
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,574
FOR WHATEVER SATISFACTION
WE MAY GET FROM THE KNOWLEDGE,

941
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,867
OUR 19 LIVES
WILL BUY THE SURVIVAL

942
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:30,580
OF OVER 1,000
OF OUR FELLOW STARSHIP CREWMEN.

943
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:42,634
PHASERS ARE AT TARGET.

944
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:43,926
Spock to captain.

945
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,010
KIRK HERE.

946
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,264
FORCE FIELD IS GONE, CAPTAIN.
M-5 IS NEUTRALIZED.

947
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,516
SYSTEMS COMING BACK.

948
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,143
I CAN GIVE YOU POWER
FOR THE SHIELD, SIR.

949
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,603
I NEED COMMUNICATIONS.

950
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:54,771
WELL, THAT WILL TAKE LONGER.

951
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:56,355
THEN, CUT POWER.

952
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,565
SIR?

953
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:00,901
CUT POWER.
KEEP THOSE SHIELDS DOWN.

954
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,871
THE ENTERPRISE LOOKS DEAD.

955
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:18,419
I'M GONNA TAKE A CHANCE
HE'S NOT JUST LAYING A TRAP.

956
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,171
WESLEY TO ATTACK FORCE.

957
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,088
CAPTAIN?

958
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,132
Break off attack.
Do not fire.

959
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:26,594
Enterprise has dropped
her shields.

960
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,597
I repeat, hold attack.
Do not fire.

961
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:34,893
HE'LL HAVE TO BE COMMITTED

962
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,062
TO A TOTAL
REHABILITATION CENTER.

963
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:40,650
RIGHT NOW HE'S UNDER SEDATION
AND HEAVY RESTRAINTS.

964
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,109
I WOULD SAY HIS MULTITRONIC UNIT

965
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,069
IS IN APPROXIMATELY
THE SAME CONDITION.

966
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,531
THAT'S EXACTLY THE SITUATION
I WAS HOPING FOR.

967
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,408
WHEN I FORCED THE M-5 TO REALIZE
THAT IT HAD COMMITTED MURDER,

968
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,619
DAYSTROM FELT THAT SUCH AN ACT
WAS AN OFFENSE

969
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,746
AGAINST THE LAWS OF GOD AND MAN.

970
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,915
AND THE COMPUTER THAT CARRIED
HIS ENGRAMS ALSO BELIEVED IT.

971
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,001
CAPTAIN, WHY DID YOU FEEL
THE ATTACKING SHIPS

972
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,961
WOULD NOT FIRE
WHEN THEY SAW THE ENTERPRISE

973
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,630
APPARENTLY VULNERABLE?

974
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,716
LOGICALLY,
THAT IS THE SORT OF TRAP

975
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:06,509
M-5 SHOULD HAVE SET FOR THEM.

976
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,511
I WASN'T SURE.

977
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,472
ANY OTHER COMMANDER WOULD HAVE
SIMPLY FOLLOWED ORDERS

978
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:15,727
AND DESTROYED IT,
BUT I KNEW BOB WESLEY.

979
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,771
I GAMBLED ON HIS HUMANITY.

980
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,192
BRIDGE.

981
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:26,195
HIS LOGICAL SELECTION
WAS COMPASSION.

982
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:27,488
COMPASSION?

983
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,491
THAT'S THE ONE THING
NO MACHINE EVER HAD.

984
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,828
MAYBE IT'S THE ONE THING
THAT KEEPS MEN AHEAD OF THEM.

985
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:35,747
CARE TO DEBATE THAT, SPOCK?

986
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:36,997
NO, DOCTOR.

987
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,332
I SIMPLY MAINTAIN THAT COMPUTERS

988
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:42,336
ARE MORE EFFICIENT
THAN HUMAN BEINGS, NOT BETTER.

989
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:46,716
BUT TELL ME, WHICH DO YOU PREFER
TO HAVE AROUND?

990
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:48,967
I PRESUME YOUR QUESTION
IS MEANT TO OFFER ME A CHOICE

991
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,804
BETWEEN MACHINES
AND HUMAN BEINGS,

992
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:56,350
AND I BELIEVE I HAVE ALREADY
ANSWERED THAT QUESTION.

993
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,853
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE CONVERSATION, SPOCK.

994
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,856
IT WOULD BE MOST INTERESTING
TO IMPRESS YOUR MEMORY ENGRAMS

995
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,357
ON A COMPUTER, DOCTOR.

996
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,318
THE RESULTING
TORRENTIAL FLOOD OF ILLOGIC

997
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,987
WOULD BE MOST ENTERTAINING.

998
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,829
MR. SULU, TAKE US BACK
TO THE SPACE STATION,

999
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:20,249
AND WARP BACK TO TWO.
