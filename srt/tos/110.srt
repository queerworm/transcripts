00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:55,862
WHAT IS IT, MR. BAILEY?

353
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,655
A MESSAGE...

354
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,199

THE WARNING NATURE

372
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,451
OUR VESSEL WAS BLOCKED,

00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,990
BRILLIANT.

384
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,743
EXTREMELY SOPHISTICATED
IN THEIR METHODS.

385
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,704
DOES THE RECORDER

ON ITS TAPES?

386
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,790
ENOUGH TO WARN

RECORDER MARKER.

388

THE WAY WE--

392
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,939
<i>YOUR RECORDER MARKER</i>

00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,801
MIGHT BE INTERESTING
TO SEE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE

401
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,553
IF I CAN LOCATE
WHERE THAT VOICE
IS COMING FROM.

402
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,277
BALOK'S MESSAGE--

403
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,445
IT WAS HEARD
ALL OVER THE SHIP.

404
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,454
CAPTAIN TO CREW--

405
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,666
THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE
SERVED FOR LONG
ON THIS VESSEL

406
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,626
HAVE ENCOUNTERED
ALIEN LIFE FORMS.

407
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,254
YOU KNOW THE GREATEST DANGER
FACING US IS OURSELVES

408
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,589
AND IRRATIONAL FEAR
OF THE UNKNOWN,

409
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,633
BUT THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS THE UNKNOWN.

410
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,634
ONLY THINGS TEMPORARILY HIDDEN,

411
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,511
TEMPORARILY NOT UNDERSTOOD.

412
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,014
IN MOST CASES,
WE HAVE FOUND
THAT INTELLIGENCE

413
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,725
CAPABLE OF A CIVILIZATION

414
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,103
IS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING
PEACEFUL GESTURES.

415
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,855
SURELY A LIFE FORM
ADVANCED ENOUGH
FOR SPACE TRAVEL

416
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,108
IS ADVANCED ENOUGH
TO EVENTUALLY UNDERSTAND
OUR MOTIVES.

417
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,569

00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,705
WE CAME SEEKING
FRIENDSHIP.

423
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,290
BUT WE HAVE NO WISH
TO TRESPASS.

424
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,584
TO DEMONSTRATE
OUR GOOD WILL,

425
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,794
OUR VESSEL WILL NOW
RETURN THE WAY IT CAME.

426
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,713

427
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,590
[LOW HUMMING]

428
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,227
LAY IN A COURSE AHEAD,
MR. BAILEY.

429
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,897
WHAT? A COURSE?

430
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,108
PLOTTED AND
LAID IN, SIR.

431
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,901
ENGAGE, WARP FACTOR ONE.

432
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,361
WARP FACTOR--

433
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,197
THERE'S
NO RESPONSE.

434
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,616
SWITCH TO IMPULSE.

435
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,077
ALL ENGINE

SHOW DEAD.

436
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,036

437
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,163
SWITCHING TO SCREEN.

438
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,082
I BELIEVE I CAN
GET SOMETHING VISUAL.

439
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:47,403
<i>YOU ARE WASTING TIME</i>
<i>AND EFFORT.</i>

440
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:51,115
<i>THERE IS NO ESCAPE.</i>

441
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,619
<i>YOU HAVE</i>
<i>EIGHT EARTH MINUTES LEFT.</i>

442
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,464
I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE
HOW THEY APPEARED.

443
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,216
YES, OF COURSE YOU WERE.

444
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:12,345
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

445
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,139
SPOCK'S WASTING TIME.

446
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,476
EVERYBODY ELSE
JUST SITTING AROUND.

447
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,560
SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO DO SOMETHING.

448
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,021
EASY, BAILEY.

449
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,439
WHAT DO THEY
WANT FROM US?

450
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,982
LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT THEY WANT US
TO DO!

451
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,359
THEY WANT US
TO LOSE OUR HEADS.

452
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:28,319
WE'VE ONLY GOT
EIGHT MINUTES LEFT.

453
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,111
7 MINUTES
AND 45 SECONDS.

454
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,655
HE'S DOING
A COUNTDOWN!

455
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,448
PRACTICALLY
END OF WATCH.

456
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,408
ARE YOU ALL
OUT OF YOUR MINDS?

457
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,784
END OF WATCH?

458
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,911
IT'S THE END
OF EVERYTHING.

459
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,456
WHAT ARE YOU, ROBOTS?
WOUND-UP TOY SOLDIERS?

460
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,416
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE DYING?

461
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,959
WATCH AND REGULATIONS
AND ORDERS--

462
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:44,960
WHAT DO THEY MEAN?

463
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,837
BAILEY, YOU'RE RELIEVED!

464
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,966
ESCORT HIM
TO HIS QUARTERS, DOCTOR.

465
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,145
LET'S GO.

466
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,613

THIS IS THE CAPTAIN

469
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,665
IT IS THE CUSTOM
OF EARTH PEOPLE

00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,750
TO TRY AND AVOID
MISUNDERSTANDING

471
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,210
WHENEVER POSSIBLE.

472
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,087
WE DESTROYED
YOUR SPACE BUOY

473
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,547
AS A SIMPLE ACT
OF SELF-PRESERVATION.

474
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,589
WHEN WE ATTEMPTED
TO MOVE AWAY FROM IT,

475
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,802
IT EMITTED RADIATION
HARMFUL TO OUR SPECIES.

476
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,639
IF YOU'VE EXAMINED
OUR SHIP AND ITS TAPES,

477
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,141
YOU KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE.

478

4 MINUTES.

485
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,904
WHAT'S A MATTER
WITH THEM OUT THERE?

486
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,407
THEY MUST KNOW
WE MEAN THEM NO HARM.

487
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,409
THEY'RE CERTAINLY
AWARE BY NOW

488
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,369
THAT WE'RE TOTALLY
INCAPABLE OF IT.

489
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:46,081
THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING TO DO,

490
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,042
SOMETHING
I'VE OVERLOOKED.

491
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,669
IN CHESS,

492
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,382
WHEN ONE IS OUTMATCHED,
THE GAME IS OVER.

493
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,177
CHECKMATE.

494
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:01,888
IS THAT YOUR
BEST RECOMMENDATION?

495
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,766
I'M SOR--

496
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:10,564
I REGRET THAT I
CAN FIND NO OTHER
LOGICAL ALTERNATIVE.

497
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,118

OF THIS, CAPTAIN--

LET ME ENTER IT
IN MY MEDICAL RECORDS
AS SIMPLE FATIGUE.

501
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,087
THAT'S MY DECISION,
DOCTOR.

502
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,839
AND YOUR MISTAKE.

503
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,216
YOU OVERWORKED HIM,
PUSHED HIM,

504
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,592
EXPECTED TOO MUCH
OUT OF HIM--

505
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,344
I'M ORDERING YOU
TO DROP IT.

506
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,262
I HAVE NO TIME FOR YOU,
YOUR THEORIES,

TO ARGUE ABOUT IT.

00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,960
THAT HAS NEVER BEEN
INCORPORATED

525
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,254
INTO THE MEMORY BANKS
OF ANY EARTH SHIP.

526
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,423
SINCE THE EARLY YEARS
OF SPACE EXPLORATION,

527
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,217
EARTH VESSELS HAVE HAD
INCORPORATED INTO THEM

528
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,304
A SUBSTANCE KNOWN AS...

529
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,597
CORBOMITE.

530
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,682
IT IS A MATERIAL
AND A DEVICE

531
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,352
WHICH PREVENTS ATTACK ON US.

532
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,564
IF ANY DESTRUCTIVE ENERGY
TOUCHES OUR VESSEL,

533
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,816
A REVERSE REACTION
OF EQUAL STRENGTH

534
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,359
IS CREATED,
DESTROYING--

535
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,070
<i>YOU NOW HAVE TWO MINUTES.</i>

536
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,532
DESTROYING
THE ATTACKER!

537
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,619
IT MAY INTEREST YOU
TO KNOW

538
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,371
THAT SINCE THE INITIAL USE
OF CORBOMITE

539
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,792
MORE THAN TWO
OF OUR CENTURIES AGO,

540
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:39,296
NO ATTACKING VESSEL
HAS SURVIVED THE ATTEMPT.

541
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,508
DEATH HAS
LITTLE MEANING TO US.

542
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:45,093
IF IT HAS NONE TO YOU...

543
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,722
THEN ATTACK US NOW.

544
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,267
WE GROW ANNOYED
AT YOUR FOOLISHNESS.

545
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,081
HOWEVER,
IT WAS WELL PLAYED.

546
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,420
I REGRET NOT HAVING LEARNED
MORE ABOUT THIS BALOK.

547
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,340
IN SOME MANNER,
HE WAS REMINISCENT
OF MY FATHER.

548
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,258
THEN MAY HEAVEN HAVE
HELPED YOUR MOTHER.

549
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,719
QUITE THE CONTRARY.

550
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,595
SHE CONSIDERED HERSELF

551
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,724
A VERY FORTUNATE
EARTH WOMAN.

552
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,731
DOC...

553
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:39,773
SORRY.

554
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,651
FOR HAVING OTHER THINGS
ON YOUR MIND? MY FAULT.

555
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,986
I DON'T KNOW
HOW ON EARTH
YOU EVER KEPT

556
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,572
FROM PUNCHING ME
IN THE FACE.

557
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,704
ONE MINUTE.

558
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,415
I KNEW HE WOULD.

559
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,190
IF ANYONE'S
INTERESTED...

560
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,401
30 SECONDS.

561
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,904
REQUEST PERMISSION
TO RETURN TO POST, SIR.

562
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,703
PERMISSION GRANTED.

563
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,927
11...

564
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,762
10 SECONDS.

565
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,430
9...

566
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,473
8...

567
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,141

568
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:56,725
6...

569
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,685

570
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,353

571
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,980
3...

572
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,356
2...

573
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,275
1.

574
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:44,690
A VERY
INTERESTING GAME,
THIS POKER.

575
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:48,360
IT DOES HAVE ADVANTAGES
OVER CHESS.

576
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,028
LOVE TO TEACH IT TO YOU.

577
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,282
<i>THIS IS THE COMMANDER</i>
<i>OF THE</i> FESARIUS.

578
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,493
HERE IT COMES.
IS IT RAISE OR CALL?

579
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,329
<i>THE DESTRUCTION</i>
<i>OF YOUR VESSEL</i>

580
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,540
<i>HAS BEEN DELAYED.</i>

581
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,960
<i>WE WILL RELENT</i>
<i>IN YOUR DESTRUCTION</i>

582
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:08,922
<i>ONLY IF WE HAVE PROOF</i>
<i>OF YOUR CORBOMITE DEVICE.</i>

583
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,590
HOLD ON THAT.

584
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:13,176
LET HIM SWEAT
FOR A CHANGE.

585
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,228
SHIP TO SHIP.

586
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,063
HAILING FREQUENCIES, SIR.

587
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,524
REQUEST DENIED.

588
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,569
I HAVE VISUAL CONTACT,
CAPTAIN.

589
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,588
<i>WE WILL SOON INFORM YOU</i>

590
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:53,759
<i>OF OUR DECISION</i>
<i>REGARDING YOUR VESSEL.</i>

591
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:57,095
<i>AND HAVING PERMITTED</i>
<i>YOUR PRIMITIVE EFFORTS</i>

592
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,598
<i>TO SEE MY FORM,</i>

593
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:03,852
<i>I TRUST IT HAS PLEASED</i>
<i>YOUR CURIOSITY.</i>

594
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,854
<i>AND NOW,</i>

595
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:10,525
<i>ANOTHER DEMONSTRATION</i>
<i>OF OUR SUPERIORITY.</i>

596
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,581
I THOUGHT THE POWER
WAS OFF IN THE GALLEY.

597
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,876
I USED A HAND PHASER,
AND ZAP--HOT COFFEE.

598
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,508
SOMETHING'S GOING ON,
CAPTAIN.

599
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,685
IT'S A SMALL SHIP.

600
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,563
ABOUT 2,000 METRIC TONS.

601
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,608
<i>IT HAS BEEN DECIDED</i>

602
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,152
<i>THAT I WILL CONDUCT YOU</i>
<i>TO A PLANET</i>

603
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,946
<i>OF THE FIRST FEDERATION</i>

604
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,323
<i>WHICH IS CAPABLE</i>
<i>OF SUSTAINING</i>

605
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,200
<i>YOUR LIFE FORM.</i>

606
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,662
<i>THERE YOU WILL DISEMBARK</i>
<i>AND BE INTERNED.</i>

607
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:07,415
<i>YOUR SHIP WILL BE</i>
<i>DESTROYED, OF COURSE.</i>

608
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,208
ENGINE SYSTEMS
COMING ON, CAPTAIN.

609
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,669
<i>DO NOT BE DECEIVED</i>

610
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,921
<i>BY THE SIZE</i>
<i>OF THIS PILOT VESSEL.</i>

611
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,633
<i>IT HAS AN EQUAL POTENTIAL</i>
<i>TO DESTROY YOUR VESSEL.</i>

612
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,178
TRACTOR BEAM AGAIN.

613
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,387
<i>SO THAT YOU MAY SUSTAIN</i>

614
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,389
<i>YOUR GRAVITY</i>
<i>AND ATMOSPHERE,</i>

615
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,143
<i>YOUR SYSTEMS</i>
<i>ARE NOW OPEN.</i>

616
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,269
<i>ESCAPE IS IMPOSSIBLE</i>

617
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,148
<i>SINCE YOU ARE BEING TAKEN</i>
<i>UNDER OUR POWER</i>

618
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,441
<i>TO YOUR DESTINATION.</i>

619
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,653
<i>ANY MOVE TO ESCAPE</i>
<i>OR DESTROY THIS SHIP</i>

620
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,531
<i>WILL RESULT IN</i>
<i>THE INSTANT DESTRUCTION</i>

621
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:43,660
<i>OF THE</i> ENTERPRISE
<i>AND EVERYONE ABOARD.</i>

622
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,663
WE'RE BEING TOWED, SIR.

623
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:44,179
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STAR DATE 1514.1.

624
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,639
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
IS IN TOW.

625
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,474
TO THIS POINT,

626
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,851
NO RESISTANCE
HAS BEEN OFFERED.

627
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,310
MY PLAN?

628
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,438
A SHOW OF RESIGNATION.

629
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,607
BALOK'S TRACTOR BEAM
HAS TO BE

630
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,859
A HEAVY DRAIN OF POWER
ON HIS SMALL SHIP.

631
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,361
QUESTION--
WILL HE GROW CARELESS?

632
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,697
CAPTAIN, HE'S PULLING OUT
A LITTLE AHEAD OF US.

633
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,658
HE SNEAK POWERED DOWN A BIT.

634
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:12,082
OUR SPEED IS DOWN
TO .64 OF LIGHT.

635
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,583
I WANT A RIGHT ANGLE
COURSE.

636
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,918
SHEAR AWAY FROM HIM

637
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,753
NO MATTER WHICH WAY
HE TURNS.

638
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,545
YES, SIR.

639
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,422
MAXIMUM ACCELERATION
WHEN I GIVE THE WORD.

640
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,299
YES, SIR.

641
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,157
ENGAGE.

642
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,232
IT'S A STRAIN, CAPTAIN.

643
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,609
ENGINES ARE OVERLOADING.

644
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,029
MORE POWER.

645
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,446
WE'RE SUPERHEATING.

646
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:29,450
INTERMIX TEMPERATURE,
7,400 DEGREES.

647
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,744
7,5...

648
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,622
7,6...

649
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,626
8,000 DEGREES.

650
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,578
SHEAR AWAY, MR. BAILEY.

651
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,977
2,000 DEGREES
ABOVE MAXIMUM.

652
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,937
84...

653
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,939
85...

654
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,025
86...

655
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:27,735
SHE'LL BLOW SOON!

656
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,028
NOW, MR. SULU.

657
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,405
IMPULSE POWER TWO.

658
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,095
WE'RE BREAKING FREE, SIR.

659
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,648
ALL ENGINES STOP.

660
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,236
ALL ENGINES
STOPPED, SIR.

661
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,864
ENGINES NEED WORK BADLY,
CAPTAIN.

662
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,115
CAN YOU HOLD IT HERE
A FEW HOURS?

663
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,408
THAT MAY NOT
BE WISE.

664
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,285
HE GOT A SIGNAL
THROUGH TO
THE MOTHER SHIP.

665
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,578
AND WE'RE NOT HOME YET.

666
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:23,333
A SIGNAL, CAPTAIN.

667
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,417
IT'S VERY WEAK.

668
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,085
IT'S BALOK.

669
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:29,214
IT'S A DISTRESS SIGNAL
TO THE<i> FESARIUS.</i>

670
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:33,092
HIS ENGINES...ARE OUT...

671
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,929
HIS LIFE-SUSTAINING
SYSTEM ISN'T OPERATING.

672
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:37,847
THE MESSAGE
IS REPEATING, SIR.

673
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,974
ANY REPLY?

674
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,143
NEGATIVE. HIS SIGNAL
IS GROWING WEAK.

675
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,355
SIR, I DOUBT
IF THE MOTHER SHIP
COULD HAVE HEARD IT.

676
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,565
PLOT A COURSE FOR IT,
MR. BAILEY.

677
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,485
FOR IT, CAPTAIN?

678
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,987
DEAD AHEAD.

679
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,207
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN
SPEAKING.

680
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,376
FIRST FEDERATION VESSEL
IS IN DISTRESS.

681
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,253
WE'RE PREPARING
TO BOARD IT.

682
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,795
THERE ARE LIVES
AT STAKE--

683
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,090
BY OUR STANDARDS,
ALIEN LIFE--

684
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,133
BUT LIVES NEVERTHELESS.

685
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,343
CAPTAIN OUT.

686
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,637
COURSE PLOTTED
AND LAID IN, SIR.

687
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,515
MR. SCOTT, READY
THE TRANSPORTER ROOM.

688
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,016
AYE, SIR.

689
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,269
MR. SULU, BRING US
TO WITHIN 100 METERS.

690
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:24,977
AHEAD SLOW.

691
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,398
AHEAD SLOW, SIR.

692
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,693
JIM, DON'T YOU THINK--

693
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,821
WHAT'S THE MISSION
OF THIS VESSEL, DOCTOR?

694
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,492
TO SEEK OUT
AND CONTACT ALIEN LIFE

695
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,077
AND AN OPPORTUNITY
TO DEMONSTRATE

696
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,162
WHAT OUR HIGH-SOUNDING
WORDS MEAN.

697
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,956
ANY QUESTIONS?

698
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,958
I'LL TAKE TWO MEN
WITH ME--

699
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,086
DR. McCOY
TO EXAMINE AND TREAT
THE ALIENS IF NECESSARY,

700
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,464
AND YOU, MR. BAILEY.

701
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,176
SIR?

702
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,262
THE FACE OF THE UNKNOWN.

703
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,764
I THINK I OWE YOU
A LOOK AT IT.

704
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,768
YES, SIR.

705
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,938
CAPTAIN, REQUEST PERMISSION TO--
DENIED.

706
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,483
IF I'M WRONG,
IF IT'S A TRAP,
I WANT YOU HERE.

707
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,665
TRANSPORTER READY?

708
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,334
WELL, YES, SIR,
BUT IT'S RISKY.

709
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:32,003
WE'RE LOCKED IN
ON WHAT APPEARS
TO BE A MAIN DECK.

710
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:33,087
AIR SAMPLE?

711
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,672
BREATHABLE.
IN FACT,

712
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,008
A SLIGHTLY HIGHER
OXYGEN CONTENT
THAN OUR OWN.

713
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,760
COMMUNICATOR...

714
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,095
PHASER WEAPON.

715
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,181
THANK YOU, SCOTTY.
READY, DOCTOR?

716
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:46,351
NO, BUT YOU WON'T
LET THAT STOP YOU.

717
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,188
BEND LOW, GENTLEMEN.

718
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,607
IT READS PRETTY CRAMPED
OVER THERE.

719
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,487
READY TO TRANSPORT.

720
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,322
ENERGIZE.

721
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,068
IT'S A...DUMMY.

722
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,986
A PUPPET OF SOME KIND.

723
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,655
I'M BALOK.

724
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,115
WELCOME ABOARD.

725
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,096
I'M CAPTAIN KIRK.

726
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,764
AND McCOY AND BAILEY.

727
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,016
SIT.

728
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,643
BE COMFORTABLE.

729
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,356
GO AHEAD.

730
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,191
BE SEATED.

731
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,118
WE MUST DRINK.

732
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,911
THIS IS TRANYA.

733
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:33,082
I HOPE YOU RELISH IT
AS MUCH AS I.

734
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,006
COMMANDER BALOK...

735
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,092
I KNOW, I KNOW.

736
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,678
A THOUSAND QUESTIONS.

737
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:49,974
BUT FIRST, THE TRANYA.

738
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,193
GENTLEMEN.

739
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,824
AHH...

740
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,381
COMMANDER,
THAT PUPPET...

741
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,634
MY ALTER EGO,
SO TO SPEAK.

742
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,051
IN YOUR CULTURE,

743
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:29,138
HE WOULD BE MR. HYDE
TO MY JEKYLL.

744
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,599
YOU MUST ADMIT
HE'S EFFECTIVE.

745
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,352
YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
FRIGHTENED BY ME.

746
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,562
AND I THOUGHT
MY DISTRESS SIGNAL

747
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,272
QUITE CLEVER.

748
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,233
IT WAS A PLEASURE
TESTING YOU.

749
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,819
TESTING US?

750
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,821
I SEE.

751
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,990
I HAD TO DISCOVER
YOUR REAL INTENTIONS.

752
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,742
BUT YOU PROBED
OUR MEMORY BANKS.

753
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:50,951
YOUR RECORDS
COULD HAVE BEEN

754
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,078
A DECEPTION
ON YOUR PART.

755
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,580
AND YOUR CREW?

756
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,753
I HAVE NO CREW,
DOCTOR.

757
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,463
I RUN EVERYTHING,

758
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,882
THIS ENTIRE COMPLEX,
FROM THIS SMALL SHIP.

759
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,926
BUT I MISS COMPANY.

760
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,846
CONVERSATION.

761
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,223
EVEN AN ALIEN
WOULD BE WELCOME.

762
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:15,601
PERHAPS ONE OF YOUR MEN

763
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,854
FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME.

764
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,399
AN EXCHANGE
OF INFORMATION, CULTURES.

765
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,402
YES.
BOTH OUR CULTURES
WOULD BENEFIT.

766
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:30,491
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE WE CAN FIND
A VOLUNTEER, MR. BAILEY?

767
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,745
ME, SIR.
I'D LIKE TO VOLUNTEER.

768
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,162
AH.

769
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,290
YOU REPRESENT
EARTH'S BEST, THEN.

770
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,584
NO, SIR, I'M NOT.

771
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,544
I'LL MAKE
PLENTY OF MISTAKES.

772
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,588
BUT YOU'D FIND OUT
MORE ABOUT US
THAT WAY,

773
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:46,048
AND I'D GET
A BETTER OFFICER
IN RETURN.

774
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,303
I SEE.

775
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:55,057
WE THINK MUCH ALIKE,
CAPTAIN,

776
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,642
YOU AND I.

777
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,938
NOW, BEFORE I BRING BACK
THE<i> FESARIUS,</i>

778
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,524
LET ME SHOW YOU
MY VESSEL.

779
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:07,361
IT IS NOT OFTEN
I HAVE THIS PLEASURE.

780
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:13,242
YES, WE'RE VERY MUCH
ALIKE, CAPTAIN.

781
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,370
BOTH PROUD
OF OUR SHIPS.
