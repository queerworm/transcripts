00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,549
SO SHALL YOU DO.

361
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,605
MAINTAINING
STANDARD ORBIT, CAPTAIN.

362
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,065
LIEUTENANT UHURA,

363
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,401
ANY REPORT FROM
THE PLANET SECURITY TEAM?

364
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,778
EVERYTHING
IS QUIET, SIR.

365
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,113
CAPTAIN, I HAVE
EXTRACTED THE
SALIENT PORTION

366
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,615
OF PROFESSOR STARNES'
TAPES.

367
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,034
GOOD.

368
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,206
AMONG THE TECHNICAL
FACTS HE GATHERED,

369
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,833
PROFESSOR STARNES
ALSO OFFERED

370
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,501
SOME RATHER
UNSCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESES.

371
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,461
LET'S SEE THEM.

372
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,091
<i>LOG DATE 5025.3.</i>

373
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,886
<i>EVER SINCE OUR ARRIVAL</i>
<i>ON TRIACUS,</i>

374
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,430
<i>I'VE FELT A CERTAIN</i>
<i>GROWING FEELING</i>

375
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,806
<i>OF UNEASINESS.</i>

376
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,474
<i>AT FIRST</i>
<i>I ATTRIBUTED IT</i>

377
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,436
<i>TO THE USUAL</i>
<i>CASE OF NERVES</i>

378
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,938
<i>ASSOCIATED</i>
<i>WITH ANY NEW PROJECT.</i>

379
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,608
<i>HOWEVER, I'VE FOUND THAT</i>
<i>THE REST OF MY ASSOCIATES</i>

380
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,527
<i>ARE ALSO BOTHERED</i>
<i>BY THESE...ANXIETIES.</i>

381
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,197
<i>THE ONLY ONES NOT AFFECTED</i>
<i>ARE THE CHILDREN</i>

382
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,741
<i>WHO, BLESS THEM,</i>

383
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,201
<i>FIND THE WHOLE THING</i>
<i>AN EXCITING ADVENTURE.</i>

384
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,370
<i>AH, TO BE YOUNG AGAIN.</i>

385
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,831
LET'S SEE SOME MORE

386
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,584
OF THESE UNSCIENTIFIC
HYPOTHESES, MR. SPOCK.

387
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,257
<i>5032.4.</i>

388
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,260
<i>THE FEELING</i>
<i>OF ANXIETY</i>

389
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,804
<i>WE'VE ALL</i>
<i>BEEN EXPERIENCING</i>

390
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,431
<i>IS GROWING WORSE.</i>

391
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,767
THERE IS ANOTHER
PORTION, CAPTAIN,

392
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:06,353
WHICH I BELIEVE YOU'LL FIND
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING.

393
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,858
<i>5038.3.</i>

394
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,112
<i>PROFESSOR WILKINS FINISHED</i>
<i>HIS EXCAVATION TODAY.</i>

395
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,738
<i>ALTHOUGH</i>
<i>WHATEVER CIVILIZATION</i>

396
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,740
<i>THAT MIGHT HAVE</i>
<i>BEEN HERE</i>

397
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,494
<i>WAS DESTROYED BY</i>
<i>SOME NATURAL CATASTROPHE,</i>

398
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,998
<i>IT APPEARS ONE OF THE RACE</i>
<i>TOOK REFUGE IN THE CAVE.</i>

399
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,540
<i>AND, FOR OUR EFFORTS,</i>

400
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,544
<i>WE ARE BECOMING</i>
<i>ONLY MORE APPREHENSIVE,</i>

401
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,173
<i>AS IF</i>
<i>SOME UNSEEN FORCE</i>

402
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,301
<i>WERE...INFLUENCING US.</i>

403
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,637
WHAT HAPPENED?

404
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,263
UNKNOWN.

405
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,437
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
COME IN, TOMMY.

406
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,149
CAPTAIN, AFTER WE LEAVE
HERE, CAN YOU TAKE US
TO MARCOS 12?

407
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,443
NO. WE'LL PROBABLY TAKE YOU
TO A FEDERATION STARBASE.

408
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,363
BUT I HAVE
RELATIVES
ON MARCOS 12.

409
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,531
I'M SORRY, TOMMY.

410
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,742
MARCOS 12 IS NOT
WITHIN OUR PATROL AREA.

411
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,787
MR. SPOCK, WE'LL PURSUE
THIS IN MY QUARTERS.

412
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,165
CAPTAIN, CAN I STAY
HERE AND WATCH?

413
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,249
I'LL BE VERY QUIET.

414
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,835
ALL RIGHT, TOMMY.

415
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,253
LIEUTENANT, HAVE DR. McCOY
REPORT TO MY QUARTERS

416
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,255
FOR A BRIEF CONFERENCE.

417
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,716
MR. LESLIE...

418
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,615
HI THERE.

419
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,034
HI.

420
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,624
WHAT IS THAT?

421
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,048
THE PLANET TRIACUS.

422
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,717
WILL WE SEE THAT
ALL THE TIME WE STAY HERE?

423
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,054
YES, WE WILL.
ALL THE TIME
WE'RE HERE.

424
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,181
HE SEES TRIACUS
ON THE SCREEN.

425
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,892
HE THINKS HE SEES IT.

426
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,992
MR. SULU, THE SCREEN!
WE'RE OUT OF ORBIT!

427
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,635
WILL WE REACH
MARCOS 12 SOON?

428
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,262
VERY SOON.

429
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,968
WHEN DID
WE CHANGE COURSE?

430
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,679
WE HAVEN'T
CHANGED COURSE.

431
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,223
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WE
HAVEN'T CHANGED COURSE?

432
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,141
LOOK AT YOUR
BRIDGE-CONTROL MONITOR.

433
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,185
WE'RE STILL
IN ORBIT, SIR.

434
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,103
HAVE YOU GONE
COMPLETELY BLIND?

435
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,771
THAT'S NOT
ORBITING POSITION.

436
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,566
DON'T TOUCH
THE CONTROLS, SIR.

437
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,985
WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

438
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,029
WE MUST REMAIN IN
THIS ORBIT TILL THE
BRIDGE ORDERS A CHANGE.

439
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,488
YOU BLIND FOOL!

440
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,992
CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT'S
IN FRONT OF YOU?

441
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,493
WE'RE NOT IN ORBIT!

442
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,247
I WILL NOT
DISOBEY AN ORDER
FROM THE BRIDGE.

443
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,623
YOU<i> ARE</i> DISOBEYING AN
ORDER FROM THE BRIDGE.

444
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,584
NOW STEP ASIDE.

445
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:42,255
YOU'RE LOSING CONTROL
OF YOURSELF, SIR.

446
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,714
NOT YET.

447
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,525
<i>I'M BEING INFLUENCED</i>
<i>TO DO THINGS</i>

448
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,361
<i>THAT DO NOT</i>
<i>MAKE SENSE.</i>

449
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,446
<i>I EVEN WENT SO</i>
<i>FAR AS TO CALL</i>
<i>STARFLEET COMMAND</i>

450
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,823
<i>TO REQUEST</i>
<i>A SPACESHIP</i>

451
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,243
<i>TO BE USED</i>
<i>AS A TRANSPORT.</i>

452
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,913
<i>IT WAS ONLY WHEN</i>
<i>I COULDN'T TELL THEM</i>

453
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,706
<i>WHAT I WANTED</i>
<i>TO TRANSPORT</i>

454
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,376
<i>THAT I BEGAN TO REALIZE</i>
<i>THAT MY MIND WAS</i>
<i>BEING DIRECTED.</i>

455
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,962
<i>I DECIDED TO SEND</i>
<i>A DISPATCH TO STARFLEET</i>

456
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,588
<i>WARNING THEM.</i>

457
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,216
<i>OH, GOD, FORGIVE US.</i>

458
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,093
<i>MUST DESTROY OURSELVES.</i>

459
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,345
<i>ALIEN UPON US,</i>

460
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,014
<i>THE ENEMY</i>
<i>FROM WITHIN...</i>

461
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,808
<i>THE ENEMY!</i>

462
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,439
HE NEVER COMPLETED
THE ENTRY.

463
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,983
AND THE DISPATCH
WAS NEVER SENT.

464
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,483
EXCEPT FOR SCENES
OF FAMILY LIFE,

465
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,112
GAMES AND PICNICS
WITH THE CHILDREN,

466
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,114
THAT IS THE
COMPLETE RECORD.

467
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,657
WHATEVER
OVERWHELMED THEM

468
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,993
MUST'VE DONE SO
WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED.

469
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,412
OTHERWISE, THE PROFESSOR
WOULD HAVE PROVIDED DETAILS

470
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,413
OF THE EXPERIENCE.

471
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,957
HE WAS AN
EXCELLENT SCIENTIST

472
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,376
AND TIRELESS
IN HIS PURSUIT
OF THE TRUTH.

473
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,795
THAT COULD BE
WHAT DESTROYED HIM.

474
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,046
POSSIBLE, CAPTAIN.

475
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,132
EVIL DOES SEEK
TO MAINTAIN POWER

476
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,384
BY SUPPRESSING
THE TRUTH.

477
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,303
OR BY MISLEADING
THE INNOCENT.

478
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,512
MISLEADING THE INNOCENT?

479
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,514
I WONDER.

480
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,518
DO YOU MEAN
THE CHILDREN
MAY BE INVOLVED?

481
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,195
YES, DOCTOR.

482
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,863
SPOCK...

483
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,699
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THE RACE
THAT LIVED HERE?

484
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,368
ACCORDING TO THE LEGEND,

485
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:38,037
TRIACUS WAS THE SEAT
OF A BAND OF MARAUDERS

486
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,415
WHO MADE CONSTANT WAR
THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM
OF EPSILON INDI.

487
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,500
AFTER MANY CENTURIES,

488
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,627
THE DESTROYERS
WERE THEMSELVES DESTROYED

489
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,380
BY THOSE THEY
HAD PREYED UPON.

490
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:47,796
IS THAT THE
END OF IT?

491
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,423
NO.

492
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,508
LIKE SO MANY LEGENDS,

493
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,386
THIS ONE, TOO,
HAS A FRIGHTENING ENDING.

494
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,763
IT WARNS THAT THE EVIL
IS AWAITING A CATALYST

495
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,516
TO SET IT AGAIN
INTO MOTION

496
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,643
AND SEND IT MARAUDING
ACROSS THE GALAXY.

497
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,440
IS IT POSSIBLE

498
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:10,027
THAT THE EVIL
FOUND THE CATALYST?

499
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:13,197
I WAS SPEAKING
OF A LEGEND, CAPTAIN.

500
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,741
BUT MOST LEGENDS HAVE
THEIR BASIS IN FACT, SPOCK.

501
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,493
I THINK I
READ YOU, JIM,

502
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,745
BUT AS MEDICAL OFFICER,
I MUST WARN YOU

503
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,788
THAT UNLESS
THE NORMAL GRIEF

504
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,416
IS TAPPED AND RELEASED

505
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,750
FROM THESE CHILDREN,

506
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,711
YOU ARE TREADING
DANGEROUSLY.

507
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,964
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR DIAGNOSIS, DOCTOR,
AND I WILL RESPECT IT.

508
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,343
BUT NOT TO THE EXCLUSION
OF THE SAFETY OF THE
ENTERPRISE, THANK YOU.

509
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,226
SPOCK,
WHAT OTHER EXPEDITIONS

510
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,019
HAVE VISITED TRIACUS?

511
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,812
ACCORDING TO
FEDERATION RECORDS,

512
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:46,980
THIS IS THE FIRST.

513
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,149
WHAT WAS IT
PROFESSOR STARNES SAID

514
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,402
ABOUT THE UNSEEN FORCE?

515
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,447
HE SAID THAT AN UNSEEN
FORCE WAS INFLUENCING HIM,

516
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:55,781
THAT HE RECOGNIZED IT,

517
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,450
WAS BEGINNING
TO FIGHT IT,

518
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,786
AND CANCELED HIS
REQUEST FOR A SHIP.

519
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,371
A SHIP.

520
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,872
YES, A SHIP
FOR TRIACUS,

521
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,623
BUT WHY?

522
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,501
BY WHOM?

523
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,378
SECURITY DETACHMENT.

524
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,964
READY FOR RELIEF
DUTY ON TRIACUS.

525
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,840
ASSEMBLE IN
THE TRANSPORTER
ROOM IMMEDIATELY.

526
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,260
I'LL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
FOR THAT PLANET
DETACHMENT

527
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,262
AS SOON AS
THEY'RE BEAMED UP.

528
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,889
I THINK IT'S
ABOUT TIME WE FOUND OUT

529
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,766
WHETHER
PROFESSOR STARNES'
ENEMY WITHIN

530
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,684
IS ON THE
PLANET BELOW

531
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,979
OR HERE ONBOARD
SHIP WITH US.

532
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,564
COME ON.

533
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:44,330
YOUR TOUR OF DUTY
WILL LAST ONE HOUR.

534
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,373
BE PREPARED WITH
YOUR COMMUNICATORS
AT ALL TIMES

535
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,334
TO REPORT
ANY ALIEN BEINGS.

536
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,793
DON'T WAIT TO INVESTIGATE.

537
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,629
BEAM DOWN THE GUARDS.

538
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,514
BEAM UP
THE SECURITY DETACHMENT

539
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,640
FROM TRIACUS.

540
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,815
SPOCK.

541
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,363
WHAT'S WRONG?

542
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,867
I AM UNABLE TO
LOCK ON TO THE PROPER
COORDINATES, CAPTAIN.

543
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,536
WHY NOT?

544
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:26,997
IT APPEARS
WE ARE NO LONGER
ORBITING TRIACUS.

545
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,874
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

546
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,585
IF WE'RE NOT
ORBITING TRIACUS,

547
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,380
THEN THE MEN
I BEAMED DOWN...

548
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,631
ARE DEAD.

549
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,967
CAPTAIN,
WE ARE NO LONGER
ORBITING TRIACUS.

550
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,304
ACTIVATE THE BRIDGE
MONITOR SCREEN.

551
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,772
CAPTAIN TO BRIDGE.

552
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,360
[KIRK]
MR. SULU, WE'RE NOT
ORBITING TRIACUS.

553
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,945
WITH ALL RESPECTS,
CAPTAIN, YOU'RE WRONG.

554
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,031
I HAVE TRIACUS
ON MY SCREEN NOW.

555
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,576
YOU'RE OFF COURSE.
I'M COMING RIGHT UP.

556
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,369
HAIL, HAIL,

557
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,162
FIRE AND SNOW,

558
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,248
CALL THE ANGEL.

559
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,499
WE WILL GO

560
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:11,958
FAR AWAY,

561
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,086
FOR TO SEE,

562
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,004
FRIENDLY ANGEL,

563
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,381
COME TO ME.

564
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,757
SULU!

565
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,966
FIRE AND SNOW,

566
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,927
CALL THE ANGEL.

567
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,512
WE WILL GO

568
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:24,930
FAR AWAY,

569
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,682
FOR TO SEE.

570
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,601
FRIENDLY ANGEL,

571
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,310
COME TO ME.

572
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,830
FRIENDS...

573
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,667
WE HAVE REACHED
A MOMENT OF CRISIS.

574
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,464
THE ENEMY HAVE DISCOVERED
OUR OPERATION...

575
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,215
BUT THEY ARE TOO LATE.

576
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,134
THEY NO LONGER
CONTROL THE SHIP.

577
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,594
WE DO.

578
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,512
WE SHALL PREVAIL.

579
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:08,682
THEY WILL TAKE US
ANYPLACE WE DESIRE,

580
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,393
SO BACK TO YOUR STATIONS.

581
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,562
MAINTAIN YOUR CONTROLS.

582
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,356
IF RESISTANCE MOUNTS,
CALL UPON THEIR BEASTS.

583
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,109
THEIR BEASTS
WILL SERVE US WELL.

584
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,528
THE FEAR IN
EACH ONE OF THEM

585
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,490
IS THE BEAST
WHICH WILL CONSUME HIM.

586
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:25,991
REMEMBER HOW IT WAS
ON TRIACUS?

587
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,993
IF THEY RESIST,

588
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:31,455
SO SHALL IT BE
ON THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

589
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,874
IF YOU NEED ME,
CALL, AND I WILL APPEAR.

590
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,211
OUR NEW GOAL
IS MARCOS 12.

591
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,547
IT IS OUR NEW BEGINNING.

592
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,258
WE MUST NOT FALTER.

593
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,434
GO TO YOUR STATIONS.

594
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,812
MARY, YOU REMAIN
HERE WITH ME.

595
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,493
HELMSMAN,

596
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,537
DISREGARD WHAT YOU
SEE ON THE SCREEN,

597
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,873
WHAT YOU THINK
YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN.

598
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,543
SET A COURSE
FOR STARBASE 4.

599
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,844
HELMSMAN,
DID YOU HEAR ME?

600
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,595
YES, SIR.

601
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,931
LIEUTENANT UHURA,

602
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,809
CONTACT STARBASE 4.

603
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,520
TELL THEM WE'RE BRINGING
THE CHILDREN THERE.

604
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,481
TELL STARFLEET COMMAND
I SUSPECT THEM

605
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,191
OF BEING ALIEN
IN NATURE,

606
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,902
AND I WANT A THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION MADE

607
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:44,986
UPON OUR ARRIVAL.

608
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,113
AYE, AYE, SIR.

609
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,756
LIEUTENANT...

610
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,760
WHAT ARE YOU
STARING AT?

611
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,387
I SEE MY DEATH.

612
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,808
A LONG DEATH.

613
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,853
DISEASE AND PAIN.

614
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:18,978
I SEE MY DEATH.

615
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,398
LIEUTENANT...

616
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,776
LIEUTENANT,
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

617
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:27,279
OH, GOD!
CAPTAIN,
DON'T LET IT BE.

618
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,910
MR. SPOCK, YOU MAKE
THE CALL TO STARFLEET.

619
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,465
MR. SULU, I ORDERED
YOU TO CHANGE COURSE.

620
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,143
MR. SULU--

621
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,604
CAPTAIN, STAY AWAY
FROM THE CONTROLS!

622
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,649
IF YOU TOUCH THEM,
WE'LL BE DESTROYED.

623
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:06,985
MR. SULU, THERE'S
NOTHING THERE!

624
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,615
CAPTAIN, WHY ARE WE
BOTHERING STARFLEET?

625
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,375
THAT WAS AN
ORDER, SPOCK.

626
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,919
THIS BRIDGE IS UNDER
COMPLETE CONTROL.

627
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,003
COMPLETE--

628
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,756
THERE IS NO NEED.

629
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,760
TAKE A LOOK
AROUND YOU.

630
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:08,338
I CANNOT OBEY
YOUR ORDER, CAPTAIN.

631
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,536
TAKE MR. SULU
TO HIS QUARTERS.

632
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,120
HE IS RELIEVED
OF DUTY.

633
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,539
[GARBLED SPEECH]

634
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,593
[GARBLED SPEECH]

635
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:10,984
FROM THE--

636
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,944
CONFINE THEM--

637
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,028
QUARTERS.

638
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,654
CAN'T YOU HEAR ME?

639
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,575
DID YOU HEAR ME?

640
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,481
CAPTAIN...

641
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,733
WE MUST GET OFF
THIS BRIDGE.

642
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,820
YES, WE MUST.

643
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,114
I'M LOSING COMMAND.

644
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,242
I'M LOSING
MY ABILITY TO COMMAND.

645
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,746
I'M LOSING
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

646
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,334
I'M LOSING COMMAND.

647
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,878
I'M LOSING
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

648
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:15,132
MY SHIP IS
SAILING ON AND ON.

649
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,635
I'M ALONE.

650
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,930
ALONE.

651
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,474
ALONE.

652
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,102
I'M LOSING COMMAND.

653
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,812
CAPTAIN.

654
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,355
I'VE LOST COMMAND.

655
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,899
I'VE LOST
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

656
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,110
CAPTAIN KIRK.

657
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,740
JIM.

658
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,130
I'VE GOT COMMAND.

659
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,092
I'VE GOT COMMAND.

660
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,930
I'VE GOT COMMAND.

661
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:07,017
CORRECT, CAPTAIN.

662
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,902
WHERE TO, CAPTAIN?

663
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,028
AUXILIARY CONTROL,

664
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,488
MY VULCAN FRIEND.

665
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,449
THIS SHIP
IS OFF COURSE.

666
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,872
SCOTTY.

667
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,874
I WANT YOU
TO OVERRIDE

668
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,417
THE BRIDGE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM

669
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,460
AND PLOT A COURSE
FOR STARBASE 4.

670
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,171
I CAN'T DO THAT, SIR.

671
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,338
WHY NOT?

672
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,591
THESE ARE VERY
SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS.

673
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,052
I WILL NOT HAVE YOU UPSET
THEIR DELICATE BALANCE.

674
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,846
WE WOULD ALL BE
LOST, FOREVER LOST.

675
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,189
GO AWAY NOW.

676
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:58,193
GO AWAY OR
WE'LL KILL YOU.

677
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,736
SCOTTY, LISTEN TO ME.

678
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:04,532
THE ENTERPRISE
HAS BEEN INVADED
BY ALIEN BEINGS.

679
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,576
ITS DESTINATION
IS MARCOS.

680
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,162
IF WE TAKE IT THERE,
MILLIONS WILL DIE,

681
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,414
THE WAY THEY DIED
AT TRIACUS!

682
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,190
OH, I'M ALL
RIGHT, SPOCK.

683
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,068
MY BEAST IS FINISHED.

684
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,319
IT WON'T RETURN.

685
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,780
CAPTAIN, SO LONG
AS THE CHILDREN
ARE PRESENT,

686
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,073
THERE IS DANGER.

687
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,532
THEY ARE THE CARRIERS.

688
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,952
SPOCK, THEY'RE NOT
THE ALIEN BEINGS.

689
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,954
THEY'RE CHILDREN

690
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:51,955
BEING MISLED.

691
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,539
THEY ARE FOLLOWERS.

692
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,917
WITHOUT FOLLOWERS,
EVIL CANNOT SPREAD.

693
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:56,960
THEY'RE CHILDREN.

694
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,462
CAPTAIN, THE
430 MEN AND WOMEN

695
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,422
ON BOARD THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

696
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,799
AND THE SHIP ITSELF

697
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,801
ARE ENDANGERED

698
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,094
BY THESE...CHILDREN.

699
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,264
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND

700
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,432
THE EVIL THAT
THEY'RE DOING.

701
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,433
PERHAPS THAT IS TRUE,

702
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,812
BUT THE EVIL
THAT IS WITHIN THEM

703
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,396
IS SPREADING FAST.

704
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,316
AND UNLESS WE CAN FIND
A WAY TO REMOVE IT...

705
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,443
WE'LL HAVE TO KILL THEM.

706
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,412
CAPTAIN KIRK--

707
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:34,497
WHAT IS IT, ENSIGN?

708
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,581
I HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED

709
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,335
TO PLACE YOU AND
MR. SPOCK UNDER ARREST.

710
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,169
BY WHOSE ORDER?

711
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,046
STARFLEET COMMAND, SIR.

712
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,797
WHERE DID YOU HEAR

713
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,258
THIS ORDER, ENSIGN?

714
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,432
NOW, LISTEN TO ME.

715
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,393
THIS ORDER IS FALSE.

716
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,897
I WANT YOU AND YOUR MEN
TO RETURN TO THEIR STATIONS.

717
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,358
I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN,
BUT I MUST INSIST
YOU AND MR. SPOCK

718
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,943
COME WITH ME TO THE
DETENTION SECTION.

719
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,653
ENSIGN,
LISTEN TO ME.

720
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,081
DO NOT FORCE ME
TO KILL YOU, SIR.

721
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,583
I WILL IF I HAVE TO.

722
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,928
WILL YOU COME
PEACEFULLY, CAPTAIN?

723
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:33,014
ENSIGN, LISTEN TO ME.
THIS IS A FALSE ORDER, ENSIGN.

724
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,933
I HAVE NEVER DISOBEYED
AN ORDER, CAPTAIN.

725
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,517
I KNOW THAT, ENSIGN.

726
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,519
YOU HAVE NEVER
DISOBEYED AN ORDER,

727
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,438
BUT AN ALIEN BEING
IS ABOARD THIS SHIP.

728
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,523
I WILL NOT DISOBEY!
I CANNOT DISOBEY!

729
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,900
ENSIGN, LISTEN TO ME!
YOU WILL DISOBEY THIS ORDER!

730
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,069
STARFLEET COMMAND
SUPERSEDES YOUR ORDER, SIR!

731
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,002
AHH...

732
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,466
ENOUGH.

733
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,514
TAKE THESE MEN
TO DETENTION

734
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:30,738
THEN JOIN ME
ON THE BRIDGE.

735
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,371
THE ENTERPRISE
WILL NEVER REACH
MARCOS 12.

736
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,373
WE WILL NOT
BE LANDED THERE.

737
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,375
THE CREW WILL TAKE US.
THE CREW BELIEVES.

738
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,378
THE CREW...
DOES NOT UNDERSTAND.

739
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,339
WHEN WE MAKE THEM
UNDERSTAND AS I UNDERSTAND,

740
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:48,798
THEY WON'T TAKE
YOU TO MARCOS!

741
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,300
THEY WILL!

742
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,259
WE ARE GOING
TO MARCOS!

743
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:52,385
YOU WON'T! YOU WON'T.

744
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,262
WE'RE GOING TO
FOLLOW OUR FRIEND!

745
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:57,015
THEY WILL!

746
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,100
YOUR FRIEND...
WHERE IS YOUR FRIEND?

747
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,144
WHERE IS
THAT STOWAWAY?

748
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,728
WHY DOES HE HIDE?

749
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,231
HE WILL COME,
IF WE CALL HIM.

750
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:05,940
BUT WE WON'T.
WE DON'T NEED HIM.

751
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,902
WE'RE NOT
AFRAID OF YOU!

752
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,864
GOOD. GOOD, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF ME.

753
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,867
BUT YOUR LEADER...

754
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,118
IS AFRAID.

755
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,619
WHAT'S HE AFRAID OF?

756
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,413
HE'S NOT AFRAID
OF ANYBODY.

757
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,289
HE'S NOT AFRAID
OF ANYTHING.

758
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,582
HE'S AFRAID TO BE SEEN.

759
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,085
AND WHEN THE CREW
SEES AND HEARS HIM,

760
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:29,005
THEY'LL UNDERSTAND THAT
HE IS NOT THEIR FRIEND,

761
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,673
AND THEY WON'T
FOLLOW HIM.

762
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,591
HE IS OUR FRIEND.

763
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,010
THEN LET HIM
SHOW HIMSELF.

764
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,262
BRING HIM OUT!

765
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:39,807
LET HIM PROVE TO ME
THAT HE IS MY FRIEND

766
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,685
AND I'LL FOLLOW HIM TO MARCOS 12
AND TO THE ENDS OF THE UNIVERSE!

767
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,562
NO!

768
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,484
MR. SPOCK,

769
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,362
PLAY BACK THE CHANT
THE CHILDREN SANG

770
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,781

TO SEE THE
WORLD AS IT IS.

790
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,876
COME ON.

791
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:55,674
WHO HAS SUMMONED ME?

792
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,010
I DID, GORGAN.

793
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,053
MY BEAST IS GONE.

794
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,264
IT LOST ITS POWER

795
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,682
IN THE LIGHT

796
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,684
I COMMAND AGAIN,

797
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,896
AND I ORDERED YOU HERE.

798
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,273
NO, CAPTAIN.

799
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,275
I COMMAND HERE.

800
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,278
MY FOLLOWERS ARE
STRONG AND FAITHFUL

801
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,238
AND OBEDIENT.

802
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,657
THAT'S WHY WE
TAKE WHAT IS OURS

803
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,909

00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,370

WHO DO NOT KNOW YOU.

805
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,456
AND WE KNOW YOU.

806
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,916
THEN YOU KNOW
I MUST WIN, CAPTAIN.

807
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:29,792
NOT IF WE JOIN
TOGETHER TO FIGHT YOU.

808
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,877
FOOLISH.

809
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,463
YOU WILL BE DESTROYED.

810
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,299
I WOULD ASK
YOU TO JOIN ME,

811
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,259
BUT YOU ARE GENTLE,

812
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,678
AND THAT IS
A GRAVE WEAKNESS.

813
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,263
WE ARE ALSO VERY STRONG.

814
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,307
AH, BUT YOUR
STRENGTH IS CANCELED

815
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,766

00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,435
YOU ARE

817
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,270

CANNOT BE CHANGED.

THE PARENTS.

819
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,984
YOU MUST BE ELIMINATED.

820

OF SOME OF YOU ON TRIACUS.

821
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,326
I'D LIKE TO
SHOW THEM TO YOU.

822
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,286
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE THEM?

823
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,164
MR. SPOCK, THE PICTURES.

824
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,291
I FORBID IT.

825
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,002
WHY SHOULD YOU FEAR IT?

826
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,587
I FEAR NOTHING.

827
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,922
SO WE WERE TOLD.
MR. SPOCK, THE PICTURES.

828
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,841

THEY WERE
AGAINST US.

832
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:38,588
THEY HAD TO BE
ELIMINATED.

834
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,349

HAVE DESTROYED YOU,

YOU TOO LATE.

836

ALSO TOO LATE.

NOT ALWAYS, GORGAN.
NOT THIS TIME.
