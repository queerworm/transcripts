1
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:07,792
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 5818.4--

2
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:09,625
A BOTANICAL PLAGUE
IS DEVASTATING A PLANET

3
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,000
IN THE QUADRANT
OF THE GALAXY

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,458
WHERE THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
<i>IS OPERATING AT PRESENT.</i>

5
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,250
IT THREATENS TO DESTROY
THE VEGETATION

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,291
ON THE ENTIRE PLANET,

7
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,750
LEAVING IT UNINHABITABLE.

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,125
UNDER FEDERATION ORDERS,

9
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,208
WE'RE PROCEEDING
AT TOP WARP SPEED
TO THE PLANET ARDANA,

10
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,834
WHERE THE ONLY
KNOWN SOURCE
OF ZIENITE EXISTS.

11
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:29,625
IT IS THE ONE SUBSTANCE
THAT CAN HALT
THE PLAGUE.

12
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,250
CAPTAIN, THE HIGH ADVISER
OF ARDANA

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,834
IS READY TO RECEIVE YOU
ON STRATOS, SIR.

14
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,250
ON STRATOS?

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,333
THAT'S THEIR CLOUD CITY,
ISN'T IT, MR. SPOCK?

16
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,875
IT IS, CAPTAIN.

17
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,250
THERE MUST BE
SOME MISTAKE.

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,583
DO YOU HAVE
THE COORDINATES

19
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,583
TO THE MINE
ENTRANCE AVAILABLE?

20
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,458
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN
PROVIDED TO THE TRANSPORT
OFFICER, CAPTAIN,

21
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,750
ALONG WITH THOSE
OF THE COUNCIL CHAMBER
OF THE HIGH ADVISER.

22
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,458
KIRK TO
TRANSPORTER ROOM.

23
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,667
Scotty: READY
TO TRANSPORT, CAPTAIN.

24
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,083
MR. SCOTT,
ARE YOU LOCKED IN
ON THE MINE ENTRANCE

25
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,959
OR ON THEIR
CLOUD CITY, STRATOS?

26
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,500
THE MINE ENTRANCE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU
ORDERED, CAPTAIN.

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,125
FINE.

28
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,125
UHURA, TELL
THE HIGH ADVISER

29
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,041
THAT, UH, WE REQUEST

30
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,667
TO DISPENSE
WITH THE WELCOMING
CEREMONIES,

31
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,166
DUE TO
THE EMERGENCY,

32
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,250
THAT WE'RE BEAMING
DIRECTLY DOWN
TO THE MINE ENTRANCE

33
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,083
IN ORDER TO
ENSURE THE FASTEST
POSSIBLE DELIVERY

34
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,917
OF THE ZIENITE.
THE NEED IS URGENT.

35
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:17,250
AYE, SIR.

36
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,208
MR. SPOCK,
COME WITH ME.

37
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,834
OH, AND TELL THEM
THAT WE APPRECIATE
THE HONOR

38
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:24,750
AND THAT WE LOOK
FORWARD TO SOME
VISIT IN THE FUTURE.

39
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,166
AYE, SIR.

40
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:50,250
STRATOS, CAPTAIN...

41
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,333
A CITY ACTUALLY FLOATING
IN THE SKY.

42
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,709
LOOKS AS TRANQUIL
AS ITS REPUTATION,
DOESN'T IT?

43
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:58,125
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST
INTERESTING METROPOLISES
IN THE GALAXY.

44
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,041
HAVE YOU EVER
VISITED HERE, CAPTAIN?

45
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,041
ONCE. I DIDN'T HAVE
TIME TO LOOK AROUND.

46
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,917
I'VE NEVER HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY.

47
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:06,583
HOWEVER, I HEAR
ITS ART FORMS
ARE INCOMPARABLE.

48
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,125
YES. ART IS
THE POPULATION'S
CHIEF OCCUPATION.

49
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,917
IT IS A TOTALLY
INTELLECTUAL SOCIETY.

50
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:14,792
ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE
HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

51
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:16,041
THERE'S
THE MINE ENTRANCE.

52
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,458
THE ZIENITE CONSIGNMENT
SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE.

53
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:32,417
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

54
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:35,917
THOSE TROGLYTE MINERS
WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
MADE DELIVERY

55
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:36,709
WHEN WE BEAMED DOWN.

56
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,500
PERHAPS THERE IS
ANOTHER ENTRANCE, CAPTAIN.

57
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,083
PERHAPS.

58
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:52,083
IT WOULD SEEM THE TROGLYTES
HAVE CHANGED THEIR MINDS
ABOUT DELIVERY.

59
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,333
Kirk: SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

60
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:21,083
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

61
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,792
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--

62
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,375
TO EXPLORE STRANGE NEW WORLDS,

63
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:29,291
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,

64
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:33,041
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

65
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,542
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF THIS ATTACK?

66
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,375
INTERFERENCE BREEDS
ATTACK, CAPTAIN.

67
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,792
COME ON!

68
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,792
WE'RE HERE BY PERMISSION
OF YOUR GOVERNMENT COUNCIL

69
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:23,917
ON AN EMERGENCY MISSION.

70
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,542
MOVE ON, CAPTAIN.

71
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,625
TROGLYTES, HALT!

72
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,583
SURRENDER
OR WE'LL FIRE!

73
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,667
ARE YOU HARMED,
GENTLEMEN?

74
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:41,959
NO. JUST A LITTLE
SHAKEN UP.

75
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,583
I'M PLASUS, HIGH ADVISER
OF THE PLANET COUNCIL.

76
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,792
CAPTAIN KIRK,
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>

77
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,417
MY FIRST OFFICER
MR. SPOCK.

78
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:48,959
GREETINGS,
MR. ADVISER.

79
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,583
MY REGRETS FOR
THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF
YOUR WELCOME TO ARDANA.

80
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,792
IT WAS RATHER WARM.

81
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:55,583
UNFORTUNATELY,
VIOLENCE IS HABITUAL

82
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,083
WITH THE TROGLYTES,

83
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,208
BUT I ASSURE YOU,

84
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,333
THIS INSULT WILL NOT
GO UNPUNISHED.

85
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,542
WELL, I'M MORE CONCERNED
WITH THE ZIENITE CONSIGNMENT.

86
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,709
WHY WASN'T IT IN
ITS SPECIFIED LOCATION?

87
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,458
APPARENTLY,
THE DISRUPTERS
HAVE CONFISCATED IT,

88
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,125
JUST AS I KNEW
THEY WOULD.

89
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,041
THE DISRUPTERS--
WHO ARE THEY?

90
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,417
A SMALL GROUP OF
TROGLYTE MALCONTENTS.

91
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:16,375
ALL THE OTHER TROGLYTES
ARE COMPLETELY
DOMINATED BY THEM.

92
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,417
IT'S THE DISRUPTERS
WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE

93
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,542
FOR THEIR REFUSAL
TO CONTINUE MINING
FOR ZIENITE.

94
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:21,875
THEY AGREED
TO THE DELIVERY.

95
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,458
YOUR COUNCIL
ASSURED US OF IT.

96
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,083
THEY AGREED,
OBVIOUSLY,

97
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,834
AS A RUSE TO GET
VALUABLE HOSTAGES.

98
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,291
HOSTAGES?

99
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,917
FOR WHAT PURPOSE?

100
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:31,959
TO FORCE THE COUNCIL
TO MEET THEIR DEMANDS.

101
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,458
ORGANIZE
A SEARCH PARTY
IMMEDIATELY

102
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,917
AND FIND THE ZIENITE
CONSIGNMENT.

103
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,667
MEANWHILE, CAPTAIN,
I WOULD SUGGEST

104
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,041
THAT YOU AND
FIRST OFFICER SPOCK

105
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,291
BE OUR GUESTS
ON STRATOS.

106
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,500
VERY WELL.

107
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,166
I...DO HOPE THE SEARCH
WILL BE BRIEF, MR. ADVISER.

108
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,208
WE'LL DO
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE
TO MAKE IT SO.

109
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,375
COME, GENTLEMEN.

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,959
REMARKABLE.

111
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,792
THE FINEST EXAMPLE
OF SUSTAINED
ANTIGRAVITY ELEVATION

112
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,709
I'VE EVER SEEN.

113
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,917
THE SENTINEL TOLD ME
OF OUR HONORED
GUESTS, MY FATHER.

114
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,208
I CAME TO EXTEND
GREETINGS.

115
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,166
A MOST GRACIOUS ACT.

116
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,417
GENTLEMEN,
ONE OF OUR PLANET'S

117
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,500
MOST INCOMPARABLE
WORKS OF ART--
MY DAUGHTER DROXINE.

118
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,041
CAPTAIN JAMES KIRK.

119
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,291
A PLEASURE, MADAM.

120
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,875
INDEED, YES,
CAPTAIN.

121
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,542
AND FIRST OFFICER
SPOCK.

122
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:53,959
I HAVE NEVER BEFORE
MET A VULCAN, SIR.

123
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:57,083
NOR I A WORK
OF ART, MADAM.

124
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:00,875
COME GENTLEMEN THERE IS MUCH TO
SEE IN OUR CITY.

125
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,500
THIS IS OUR
COUNCIL GALLERY.

126
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
IT IS OPEN TO ALL
CITY DWELLERS.

127
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
WE HAVE
SOME OF THE FINEST

128
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,500
OF OUR VARIOUS ART FORMS
ASSEMBLED HERE

129
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,750
FOR THE VIEWING
AND CONTEMPLATION OF EVERY--

130
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,291
DISRUPTERS AGAIN!

131
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,917
HOW DREADFUL.
THEY'RE DESPOILING
THE WHOLE CITY.

132
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,959
DESPOIL?
FOR WHAT PURPOSE?

133
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,458
BY KEEPING US
IN CONSTANT TURMOIL,

134
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,208
THEY HOPE TO FORCE
THE COUNCIL TO ACCEDE
TO THEIR DEMANDS.

135
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,375
WHAT ARE THEIR DEMANDS?

136
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,959
COMPLETELY
UNREASONABLE,
CAPTAIN,

137
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,208
BUT NOTHING YOU NEED
BE CONCERNED WITH.

138
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,166
I MUST CONCERN MYSELF WITH IT
IF IT SHOULD INTERFERE

139
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,917
WITH THE DELIVERY
OF ZIENITE TO MERAK II.

140
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:40,542
MR. ADVISER,
THE PLANT LIFE IS
<i>THE</i> SOURCE OF OXYGEN

141
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,166
ON THAT PLANET.

142
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,667
OBVIOUSLY, IF ALL
PLANT LIFE IS DESTROYED,

143
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,542
THE HUMANOID LIFE
WILL FOLLOW.

144
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:49,875
I ASSURE YOU GENTLEMEN
YOU WILL GET
WHAT YOU CAME FOR.

145
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,917
I HOPE SO.
ARDANA IS A MEMBER
OF THE FEDERATION,

146
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,041
AND IT IS YOUR COUNCIL'S
RESPONSIBILITY

147
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,417
THAT NOTHING INTERFERES
WITH ITS OBLIGATION

148
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,083
TO ANOTHER MEMBER
OF THE FEDERATION.

149
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,166
OF COURSE, AND WE ACCEPT
THE RESPONSIBILITY.

150
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,500
WHY DO THEY DESTROY
ART FORMS?

151
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,000
THAT IS A LOSS
TO EVERYONE.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,500
ART MEANS NOTHING
TO THE DISRUPTERS.

153
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,583
THIS IS THE ONLY FORM
THEY UNDERSTAND.

154
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,875
THE DISTURBANCES
ACCOMPANYING
YOUR ARRIVAL

155
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,458
HAVE BEEN MOST
WEARYING.

156
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,083
NO DOUBT
YOU WOULD LIKE
TO REST.

157
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,834
THAT WOULD BE
MOST WELCOME,
MR. ADVISER.

158
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,834
CHAMBERS HAVE
BEEN PREPARED
FOR YOU.

159
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:24,875
A SENTINEL
WILL GUIDE YOU
TO THEM.

160
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:37,375
I'M SORRY THEY WERE
SO POORLY TREATED

161
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,166
ON THEIR FIRST VISIT
TO OUR PLANET.

162
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,375
IT'S FORTUNATE THAT
THEY WERE NOT
SERIOUSLY HURT.

163
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,583
OH, YES, THAT
WOULD HAVE BEEN DREADFUL.

164
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,375
FURTHER VIOLENCE
COULD CREATE
GRAVE DIFFICULTIES

165
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,417
BETWEEN ARDANA
AND THE FEDERATION.

166
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:56,458
THE DISRUPTERS MUST BE MAD
TO ATTACK TWO SUCH
CHARMING STRANGERS.

167
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,709
THEY GROW MORE DARING
AND DETERMINED
EVERY DAY.

168
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:03,750
NOW THEY SEEK TO FIND
ALLIES IN THE GALAXY.

169
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,667
DO YOU THINK THAT
CAPTAIN KIRK AND HIS
VERY ATTRACTIVE OFFICER

170
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:11,500
WILL FEEL THAT
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THEIR INJURIES?

171
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,250
ALL THIS TIME,
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE WORRIED

172
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,333
ABOUT OUR DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS.

173
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,667
APOLOGIES,
MR. ADVISER,

174
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:23,166
BUT THIS TROGLYTE
WAS APPREHENDED
LEAVING THE CITY.

175
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,667
HE IS WITHOUT
A TRANSPORT CARD,

176
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,792
SO WE THOUGHT
YOU WOULD WANT TO
QUESTION HIM.

177
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,834
REMOVE HIS SHIELDS.

178
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,291
WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS
IN STRATOS, TROGLYTE?

179
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,375
SPEAK!
I COMMAND YOU.

180
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,625
MY BUSINESS
IS TO REPAIR.

181
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,792
REPAIR WHAT?

182
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,542
THEY ARE DAMAGE TENSIONS PATH.

183
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:50,291
INDEED?
THEN YOU MUST HAVE
A REPAIR PERMIT.

184
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,458
WHERE IS IT?

185
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,041
IT WAS FORGOTTEN.

186
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:58,208
DID YOU ALSO FORGET
YOUR TRANSPORT CARD?

187
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,333
IT WAS LOST
WHEN YOUR SENTINELS
ATTACKED ME.

188
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,667
AND WHERE WAS
YOUR CAVERN
IMPLEMENT LOST?

189
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,917
COULD THIS PERHAPS
BE IT?!

190
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,125
I CAME TO MAKE REPAIRS.

191
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,000
AND YOU SHALL
MAKE THEM,

192
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,125
BY GIVING US
THE NAMES
OF THE DISRUPTERS.

193
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,500
I KNOW NOTHING.

194
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I WOULD ADVISE YOU
TO INCREASE
YOUR KNOWLEDGE.

195
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,041
THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE
FOR A TROGLYTE.

196
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,375
THE STRATOS CITY DWELLERS
HAVE SAID IT.

197
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,750
SECURE HIM
TO THE ROSTRUM.

198
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:35,500
AAAH!

199
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,291
HOW UNFORTUNATE.

200
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,709
HOW UNFORTUNATE.

201
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,208
Spock, voice-over:
THIS TROUBLED PLANET

202
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,709
IS A PLACE
OF THE MOST VIOLENT CONTRASTS.

203
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,792
THOSE WHO RECEIVE THE REWARDS
ARE TOTALLY SEPARATED

204
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:00,166
FROM THOSE WHO SHOULDER
THE BURDENS.

205
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,333
IT IS NOT A WISE LEADERSHIP.

206
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,375
HERE ON STRATOS,

207
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,417
EVERYTHING IS INCOMPARABLY
BEAUTIFUL AND PLEASANT.

208
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:10,583
THE HIGH ADVISER'S
CHARMING DAUGHTER DROXINE...

209
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,542
PARTICULARLY SO.

210
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:16,583
THE NAME DROXINE SEEMS
APPROPRIATE FOR HER.

211
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,291
I WONDER--CAN SHE RETAIN

212
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,875
SUCH PURITY
AND SWEETNESS OF MIND

213
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,291
AND BE AWARE OF THE LIFE
OF THE PEOPLE

214
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,583
ON THE SURFACE
OF THE PLANET?

215
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,291
THERE, THE HARSH LIFE
IN THE MINES

216
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,500
IS INSTILLING THE PEOPLE
WITH A BITTER HATRED.

217
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,000
THE YOUNG GIRL WHO LED
THE ATTACK AGAINST US

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,709
WHEN WE BEAMED DOWN

219
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:41,792
WAS FILLED WITH THE VIOLENCE
OF DESPERATION.

220
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:46,875
IF THE LOVELY DROXINE KNEW
OF THE YOUNG MINER'S MISERY,

221
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,834
I WONDER HOW THE KNOWLEDGE
WOULD AFFECT HER.

222
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,583
MR. SPOCK.

223
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,375
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
ACCOMPANIED CAPTAIN KIRK

224
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,875
TO THE REST CHAMBER.

225
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,709
YOUR MOVEMENTS
AWAKENED ME.

226
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,583
OH, MY APOLOGIES.

227
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,625
I DID NOT REALIZE
THEY WOULD DISTURB YOU.

228
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,959
ONLY VULCAN EARS
WOULD FIND THE NOISE
DISCERNIBLE.

229
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:42,959
IT SEEMS THAT VULCANS
ARE FASCINATINGLY DIFFERENT...

230
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,834
IN MANY WAYS.

231
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:49,750
THE SAME MAY BE SAID
OF STRATOS INHABITANTS.

232
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,458
VULCAN EYES
ARE VERY DISCERNING, TOO.

233
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:04,750
I HEAR THAT
INTELLECTUALLY,

234
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,709
VULCANS ARE
AS HIGHLY EVOLVED

235
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,417
AS STRATOS CITY
DWELLERS.

236
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:17,417
WE DO...
PRIDE OURSELVES

237
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,208
ON OUR LOGIC.

238
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,625
YOU AGAIN.

239
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,542
YOU SLEEP LIGHTLY,
CAPTAIN.

240
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:19,041
YES. DUTY
IS A GOOD TEACHER.

241
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,959
I SEE YOU'VE CHANGED
YOUR DRESSMAKER.

242
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,750
RELEASE ME!

243
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,417
SO YOU CAN ATTACK ME AGAIN?
THAT WOULD BE FOOLISH.

244
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:31,166
CALL THE GUARDS
IF YOU'RE AFRAID,
CAPTAIN.

245
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,291
I'M NOT AFRAID.

246
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,375
IN FACT, I FIND THIS
RATHER ENJOYABLE.

247
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,834
I DO NOT!

248
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:43,583
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU.

249
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,375
YOU ANSWER
SOME QUESTIONS,

250
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,375
AND I'LL LET YOU UP.

251
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,083
WHAT QUESTIONS?

252
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,041
YOUR WORD FIRST.

253
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,834
I WILL ANSWER.

254
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:23,125
YOU ONLY TAKE A MATE
ONCE EVERY 7 YEARS?

255
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:27,542
THE 7-YEAR CYCLE
IS BIOLOGICALLY INHERENT

256
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,125
IN ALL VULCANS.

257
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,500
AT THAT TIME,
THE MATING DRIVE

258
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,792
OUTWEIGHS ALL
OTHER MOTIVATIONS.

259
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:53,542
AND IS THERE NOTHING
THAT CAN DISTURB
THAT CYCLE,

260
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,291
MR. SPOCK?

261
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:02,625
EXTREME FEMININE BEAUTY

262
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,000
IS ALWAYS...

263
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,375
DISTURBING...

264
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,709
MADAM.

265
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,583
Kirk: SPOCK?

266
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,333
I DID NOT COME HERE
TO KILL YOU, CAPTAIN.

267
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,709
THEN WHY THIS?

268
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,250
TO TAKE YOU HOSTAGE.

269
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,959
AM I...INTRUDING, CAPTAIN?

270
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,291
VANNA.

271
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,542
DROXINE.

272
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,125
WHY HAVE YOU
COME HERE?

273
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,166
TO WELCOME
OUR HONORED GUESTS,

274
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,041
AS I WAS TAUGHT
TO DO WHEN I SERVED

275
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,834
IN YOUR FATHER'S
HOUSEHOLD.

276
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,250
HAS SHE INJURED YOU,
CAPTAIN?

277
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,625
OH, NO, NOT AT ALL.

278
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,125
IN FACT, HER VISIT
WAS QUITE ENLIGHTENING.

279
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:39,583
OH?

280
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,959
YES. IT SEEMS
THE TROGLYTES

281
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,250
ARE UNDER
THE IMPRESSION

282
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,333
THAT THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
<i>IS HERE</i>
<i>TO INTIMIDATE THEM.</i>

283
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,083
SEND A SENTINEL
TO THE REST CHAMBER
IMMEDIATELY.

284
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,750
IT IS NOT IMPRESSION,
CAPTAIN.

285
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,417
IT IS THE TRUTH.

286
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:55,041
WE'RE HERE TO GET
THAT ZIENITE CONSIGNMENT,
AND THAT'S IT.

287
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,500
STARSHIPS DO NOT
TRANSPORT CARGO.

288
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,291
IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY,
THEY DO ANYTHING,

289
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,583
AND BELIEVE ME,

290
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,333
THIS BOTANICAL PLAGUE
IS AN EMERGENCY.

291
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,125
LIES WILL NOT KEEP
THE TROGLYTES
IN THE CAVERNS,

292
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,792
AND NEITHER WILL
YOUR STARSHIP.

293
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:11,041
YOU TALK LIKE
A DISRUPTER, VANNA.

294
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,750
I SPEAK
FOR MY PEOPLE.

295
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,125
THEY HAVE AS MUCH
RIGHT TO THE CLOUDS

296
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,667
AS THE STRATOS
DWELLERS.

297
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:21,041
THE STRATOS IS FOR
ADVISERS AND STUDIERS.

298
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,417
WHAT WOULD TROGLYTES
DO HERE?

299
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:24,375
LIVE...

300
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:28,083
IN THE SUNLIGHT
AND WARMTH,

301
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,458
AS EVERYONE SHOULD.

302
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,083
THE CAVERNS ARE WARM,
AND YOUR EYES

303
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,709
ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED
TO LIGHT,

304
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:38,792
JUST AS YOUR MINDS
ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED
TO LOGIC.

305
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,291
UNACCUSTOMED
TO LIGHT AND WARMTH?

306
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,542
THAT'S NECESSARY
TO ALL HUMANOIDS.

307
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:54,250
SURELY YOU DON'T DENY IT
TO THE TROGLYTES.

308
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,667
THE TROGLYTES
ARE WORKERS, CAPTAIN.

309
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,458
OH, SURELY YOU MUST BE
AWARE OF THAT.

310
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:03,208
THEY MINE ZIENITE
FOR SHIPMENT,
TILL THE SOIL.

311
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,458
THOSE THINGS
CANNOT BE DONE HERE.

312
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,542
IN OTHER WORDS,
THEY PERFORM
ALL THE PHYSICAL TOIL

313
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,333
NECESSARY TO
MAINTAIN STRATOS.

314
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,458
THAT IS THEIR FUNCTION
IN OUR SOCIETY.

315
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,250
BUT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO SHARE ITS ADVANTAGES.

316
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,291
HOW CAN THEY SHARE
WHAT THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND?

317
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,208
THEY CAN BE TAUGHT
TO UNDERSTAND,

318
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,875
ESPECIALLY IN A SOCIETY
THAT PRIDES ITSELF
IN ENLIGHTENMENT.

319
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,917
THE COMPLETE SEPARATION
OF TOIL AND LEISURE

320
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,500
HAS GIVEN ARDANA

321
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,083
THIS PERFECTLY BALANCED
SOCIAL SYSTEM, CAPTAIN.

322
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,500
WHY SHOULD WE CHANGE IT?

323
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,083
THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET
IS ALMOST UNENDURABLE.

324
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,000
TO RESTRICT A SEGMENT
OF THE POPULATION
TO SUCH HARDSHIP

325
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,667
IS UNTHINKABLE
IN AN EVOLVED CULTURE.

326
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:45,458
THE SURFACE IS MARRED
BY VIOLENCE,

327
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,417
LIKE THE TROGLYTES.

328
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:52,417
HERE ON STRATOS,

329
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:56,583
WE HAVE COMPLETELY
ELIMINATED VIOLENCE.

330
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,917
YOU STILL REFUSE
TO DISCLOSE THE NAMES
OF THE OTHER DISRUPTERS?

331
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:07,041
THERE ARE
NO DISRUPTERS.

332
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,250
VERY WELL,
IF YOU PREFER THE RAYS.

333
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,959
TROGLYTE
IS AN ABBREVIATION

334
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:22,959
OF AN ANCIENT
EARTH TERM, CAPTAIN.

335
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,375
ITS TECHNICAL
TRANSLATION IS

336
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,959
"CAVE DWELLER."

337
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,375
YES. I SHOULD HAVE
REALIZED.

338
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,375
AAH!

339
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,625
MR. ADVISER.

340
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,834
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GOING TO QUESTION VANNA,
NOT TORTURE HER.

341
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,166
SHE'S STUBBORN.

342
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,166
AND AS YOU YOURSELF
POINTED OUT, CAPTAIN,

343
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,625
THE SEARCH FOR
YOUR ZIENITE CONSIGNMENT
MUST BE SHORT.

344
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:03,875
SURELY THERE ARE
BETTER METHODS THAN THIS.

345
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,750
PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT
IS EXTREMELY
PERSUASIVE, CAPTAIN.

346
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,250
YES. BUT I WON'T STAND BY
WHILE SOMEONE IS TORTURED.

347
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,417
IS IT PREFERABLE
TO SPARE VANNA

348
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:15,250
AND ALLOW
AN ENTIRE PLANET
TO BE DESTROYED?

349
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,875
VIOLENCE IN REALITY
IS QUITE DIFFERENT
FROM THEORY,

350
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,208
IS IT NOT, MADAM?

351
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,166
BUT WHAT ELSE
CAN THEY UNDERSTAND,
MR. SPOCK?

352
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,417
ALL THE LITTLE THINGS
YOU AND I UNDERSTAND

353
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,000
AND EXPECT FROM LIFE,

354
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,667
SUCH AS EQUALITY,
KINDNESS, JUSTICE.

355
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,875
TROGLYTES ARE NOT
LIKE STRATOS DWELLERS,
MR. SPOCK.

356
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,458
THEY'RE A CONGLOMERATE
OF INFERIOR SPECIES.

357
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,375
THE ABSTRACT CONCEPTS
OF AN INTELLECTUAL
SOCIETY

358
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,583
ARE BEYOND
THEIR COMPREHENSION.

359
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,291
THE ABSTRACT CONCEPTS
OF LOYALTY AND LEADERSHIP

360
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,333
SEEM PERFECTLY CLEAR
TO VANNA.

361
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,542
A FEW TROGLYTES
ARE BROUGHT HERE
AS RETAINERS.

362
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,917
VANNA WAS ONE OF THEM,
AS ARE THE SENTINELS.

363
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,875
THEY'VE RECEIVED
MORE TRAINING
THAN THE OTHERS.

364
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,792
BUT OBVIOUSLY
NO MORE CONSIDERATION.

365
00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:00,000
I FAIL TO SEE
THE PURPOSE

366
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,041
OF THIS CONTINUED
CRITICISM.

367
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,417
THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL USE
THAT DEVICE AGAIN

368
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,291
IS ON ONE OF US.

369
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:11,583
AN IMPOSING DISPLAY
OF PRIMITIVE GALLANTRY,
GENTLEMEN.

370
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,375
YOU REALIZE, OF COURSE,
THAT THE SENTINELS
COULD REMOVE YOU.

371
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,291
OF COURSE.

372
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,542
BUT STARFLEET COMMAND
WON'T TAKE KINDLY

373
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:21,125
TO HAVING EITHER RAYS
OR PHYSICAL FORCE USED

374
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,333
AGAINST ONE OF ITS
COMMAND PERSONNEL,
MR. ADVISER.

375
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:27,333
WHY ARE YOU SO CONCERNED
WITH THIS DISRUPTER'S
WELL-BEING?

376
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,166
BEYOND PLAIN
HUMANITARIANISM,

377
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,375
MY ORDERS ARE TO GET
THAT ZIENITE.

378
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,875
THEN STOP INTERFERING,
AND I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.

379
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,792
YOU WON'T GET IT
THROUGH TORTURE!

380
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:42,458
WE WILL GET IT FOR YOU
AND IN OUR OWN WAY.

381
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,041
REMOVE THE PRISONER
TO CONFINEMENT QUARTERS.

382
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:51,834
YOU WILL RETURN
TO YOUR SHIP AT ONCE...

383
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:54,959
OR I SHALL CONTACT YOUR
STARFLEET COMMAND MYSELF.

384
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,458
AND REPORT
YOUR INTERFERENCE

385
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,917
WITH THIS PLANET'S
GOVERNMENT.

386
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:06,291
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

387
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,583
Scotty:<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>
<i>CAPTAIN.</i>

388
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,208
MR. SCOTT, WE'RE
READY TO BEAM UP.

389
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,792
AYE, SIR.

390
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:28,750
IF CAPTAIN KIRK
APPEARS AGAIN...

391
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,375
KILL HIM.

392
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,959
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 5819.0.

393
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,375
MORE THAN 8 HOURS
HAVE PASSED

394
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,166
SINCE THE CONSIGNMENT
OF ZIENITE DISAPPEARED,

395
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,250
AND WE HAVE STILL FOUND
NO TRACE OF IT.

396
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,125
WE'VE RECEIVED WORD
FROM MERAK II

397
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,250
THAT THE BOTANICAL PLAGUE
IS SPREADING RAPIDLY.

398
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,250
DELIVERY OF THE ZIENITE
IS IMPERATIVE WITHIN 12 HOURS,

399
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,458
OR ALL LIFE ON THE PLANET
WILL BE ANNIHILATED.

400
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,291
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
ADVISE STARFLEET COMMAND

401
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,500
THAT THE ZIENITE
HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED.

402
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,834
IN MY OPINION, PLASUS' METHOD
OF ACCOMPLISHING DELIVERY

403
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,625
WILL NOT SUCCEED.

404
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,041
IF THE ZIENITE IS NOT
DELIVERED SHORTLY,

405
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,792
I SHALL HAVE TO
VIOLATE PLASUS' ORDER
OF NON-INTERFERENCE

406
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:13,709
AND WIN THE CONFIDENCE
OF THE TROGLYTE LEADER
WITH THE USE OF REASON.

407
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:15,709
THAT MAY NOT
BE EASY, JIM.

408
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,333
MEDICAL ANALYSIS
INDICATES

409
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,792
THAT TROGLYTES ARE
MENTALLY INFERIOR.

410
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,667
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, BONES.

411
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,667
THE TROGLYTES HAVE ACCEPTED
PERSONAL SACRIFICE,

412
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:24,083
A COMMON CAUSE.

413
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,792
MENTALLY INFERIOR BEINGS
ARE INCAPABLE OF THAT.

414
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:29,166
LOOK. I'VE CHECKED
MY FINDINGS THOROUGHLY.

415
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:32,000
THEIR INTELLECT RATINGS
ARE ALMOST 20% BELOW
AVERAGE.

416
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,208
THEY'RE ALL
THE SAME SPECIES.

417
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,709
THOSE WHO LIVE ON STRATOS
AND THOSE WHO LIVE BELOW

418
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,542
ALL ORIGINATED
ON THE PLANET.

419
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:41,834
THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL
EVOLUTION MUST BE SIMILAR.

420
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,000
THAT IS BASIC BIOLOGICAL LAW.

421
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,417
THAT'S TRUE, SPOCK,
BUT OBVIOUSLY,

422
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,917
THE ANCESTORS
OF THOSE WHO LIVE
ON STRATOS

423
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:50,417
REMOVED THEMSELVES
FROM THE ENVIRONMENT
OF THE MINES.

424
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:52,417
THEREFORE, THEY
AVOIDED THE EFFECTS

425
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,333
OF CERTAIN NATURAL
GROWTHS.

426
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,625
NATURAL GROWTHS?
WHAT KIND?

427
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,917
I HAD THIS ZIENITE
SAMPLE SENT UP
FROM THE SURFACE.

428
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:01,542
NOW, UNSEALED,
IT WOULD HAVE HAD
DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS

429
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,000
ON EVERYBODY HERE.

430
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,333
INCREDIBLE.
ZIENITE IS SHIPPED
ALL OVER THE GALAXY--

431
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,375
WHEREVER THERE IS DANGER
OF PLANT BACTERIA.

432
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,875
NO SIDE EFFECTS
HAVE EVER BEEN REPORTED.

433
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:13,166
THERE ARE NONE
AFTER IT'S REFINED.

434
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,959
BUT IN ITS RAW STATE,

435
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:17,333
IT EMITS AN ODORLESS,
INVISIBLE GAS

436
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,750
THAT RETARDS
THE INTELLECTUAL
FUNCTIONING

437
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,041
OF THE MIND

438
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,834
AND HEIGHTENS
THE EMOTION.

439
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:26,417
THEREFORE, IT RELEASES
A VIOLENT REACTION.

440
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,917
AND THE MINES
ARE FULL OF THAT GAS.

441
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:30,709
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND THE TROGLYTES

442
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,333
ARE CONSTANTLY
EXPOSED TO IT.

443
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,333
BONES. THE DISRUPTERS,
VANNA--

444
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,834
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.

445
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,917
THEY'VE OUTWITTED
A HIGHLY ORGANIZED,

446
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,417
SCIENTIFIC CULTURE
FOR MONTHS.

447
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:42,208
AS PART OF THE STAFF
OF STRATOS,

448
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,166
VANNA WAS REMOVED
FROM EXPOSURE
FOR A LONG PERIOD.

449
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,166
IT IS LIKELY THAT
WITHOUT SUCH EXPOSURE,

450
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,750
THE EFFECT SLOWLY
WEARS OFF.

451
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,959
THAT'S RIGHT, SPOCK,
AND THE OTHER
DISRUPTERS

452
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,959
WERE PROBABLY
REMOVED FROM
THE EXPOSURE, TOO.

453
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,750
DOES THE BRAIN
RETURN TO NORMAL?

454
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,375
ACCORDING TO
FINDINGS, IT SHOULD.

455
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:59,166
CAN YOU NEUTRALIZE
THE GAS?

456
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,500
NO, BUT A FILTER
MASK SHOULD REMOVE
THE EXPOSURE.

457
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,291
FIND ONE. MEET US
IN THE TRANSPORTER ROOM.

458
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:07,583
THIS MASK
AUTOMATICALLY ELIMINATES
ALL SUBSTANCES

459
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:10,792
INJURIOUS TO HUMANOID
LIFE, CHEMICAL AS WELL
AS BACTERIAL.

460
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:12,959
WE HAVE USED
THESE FILTER MASKS
FREQUENTLY ON--

461
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:15,208
AND DO YOU REALLY
EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE

462
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,792
THAT THAT MASK CAN ACHIEVE
INTELLECTUAL EQUALITY

463
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,208
FOR THE TROGLYTES?

464
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,875
THERE'S EVERY
INDICATION

465
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,375
THAT THE EFFECT
OF THE GAS
IS TEMPORARY,

466
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:24,250
EVEN AFTER
REPEATED EXPOSURE.

467
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,375
HOW CAN A MERE FILTER
ACCOMPLISH

468
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:29,083
WHAT CENTURIES OF EVOLUTION
HAVE FAILED TO DO?

469
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,542
DR. McCOY HAS ANALYZED
THE ZIENITE THOROUGHLY.

470
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:33,875
WE'VE CHECKED HIS FINDINGS
THROUGH THE COMPUTER,

471
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,417
AND THEY'RE
ABSOLUTELY VALID.

472
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:38,417
AND DO YOUR COMPUTERS
EXPLAIN HOW MY ANCESTORS,

473
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:40,625
WHO ALSO DWELT
IN CAVERNS,

474
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,500
EVOLVED SUFFICIENTLY
TO ERECT STRATOS...

475
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,083
WHILE TROGLYTES
DID NOT?

476
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,417
UNEQUAL EVOLUTION
DID NOT BEGIN

477
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:50,291
UNTIL AFTER YOUR ANCESTORS
REMOVED THEMSELVES

478
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:53,542
FROM CONSTANT EXPOSURE
TO THE GAS, MR. ADVISER.

479
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:55,583
OH! PREPOSTEROUS.

480
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:57,333
THERE'S NO TIME
TO ARGUE ABOUT
THE FINDINGS NOW.

481
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,417
I SIMPLY PROPOSE
TO TELL VANNA
ALL ABOUT THEM.

482
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,375
I DOUBT WHETHER EVEN VANNA
WILL BELIEVE SUCH NONSENSE.

483
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:05,667
THIS NONSENSE MIGHT
MEAN A GREAT DEAL
TO THE TROGLYTES.

484
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,041
I WOULD LIKE
TO OFFER THEM

485
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,625
A SUPPLY OF
THESE FILTER MASKS

486
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,750
IN EXCHANGE
FOR THE ZIENITE
CONSIGNMENT.

487
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,667
I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN.

488
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:16,792
SUCH AN OFFER COULD ONLY
CAUSE MORE UNREST AMONG THEM.

489
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:20,000
I CANNOT ALLOW IT
UNTIL OUR SCIENTISTS HAVE
CHECKED THE FINDINGS.

490
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,458
BUT THAT
COULD TAKE DAYS!

491
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,250
ARE YOU AFRAID
THE FILTER MASKS
WILL WORK?

492
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,750
IS THAT WHY YOU DON'T
WANT THE TROGLYTES
TO TRY THEM?

493
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,375
YOU ARE HERE TO COMPLETE
AN EMERGENCY MISSION,

494
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,000
NOT CONDUCT TESTS, CAPTAIN.

495
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,625
I'M HERE TO GET
THAT ZIENITE.

496
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,667
IF THESE WILL
HELP ME GET THEM,
THEN I'LL USE THEM.

497
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,250
AND I FORBID IT!

498
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,375
YOUR FEDERATION ORDERS
DO NOT ENTITLE YOU

499
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,333
TO DEFY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

500
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,792
THIS COMMUNICATION
HAS ENDED.

501
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:48,834
MY DIPLOMACY
IS SOMEWHAT INADEQUATE.

502
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,083
WELL, IT'S PRETTY HARD
TO OVERCOME PREJUDICE.

503
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,542
DOESN'T GIVE US MUCH
CHOICE, DOES IT?

504
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:53,750
NOR MUCH TIME.

505
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,709
WE HAVE 10 HOURS
AND 40 MINUTES

506
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:57,458
TO DELIVER
THAT CONSIGNMENT
TO MERAK II.

507
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:00,166
BEAM ME DOWN TO
VANNA'S CONFINEMENT
QUARTERS.

508
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:03,083
YOU MEAN YOU'RE
GOING BACK TO STRATOS
AGAINST GOVERNMENT ORDERS?

509
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,834
IF VANNA DOESN'T HAVE
SOMETHING DEFINITE
TO GAIN FOR HER PEOPLE,

510
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:08,041
SHE'LL DIE RATHER THAN
TURN OVER THAT ZIENITE
CONSIGNMENT.

511
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,834
THIS IS THE ONLY THING
THAT MIGHT CONVINCE HER.

512
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,208
CAPTAIN, IF YOU
ARE APPREHENDED

513
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,834
DELIBERATELY VIOLATING
THE HIGH ADVISERS'
ORDERS,

514
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:16,625
HE WILL BE
WITHIN HIS RIGHTS
TO HAVE YOU EXECUTED

515
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,291
IF HE CHOOSES.

516
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:21,000
IF YOU'RE ABOUT
TO SUGGEST THAT
YOU CONTACT VANNA,

517
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,917
THE ANSWER IS
NEGATIVE, SPOCK.

518
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,125
THAT GOES FOR YOU,
TOO, BONES.

519
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,625
ALLOW ME TO POINT OUT
THAT A FIRST OFFICER

520
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,000
IS MORE EXPENDABLE

521
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,166
THAN EITHER A DOCTOR
OR A CAPTAIN.

522
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,542
OFFICIALLY, YES,

523
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,792
BUT THIS MISSION IS
STRICTLY UNOFFICIAL.

524
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,000
NOBODY IS TO HAVE
ANY PART IN IT,

525
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,875
ANY RESPONSIBILITY
FOR IT, BUT MYSELF.

526
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,417
THAT'S AN ORDER,
SPOCK.

527
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:41,542
YOU HAVE THE CON.

528
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,041
STAND BY
TILL I CONTACT YOU.

529
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,792
VANNA...

530
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:02,208
I'VE BROUGHT YOU
A GIFT.

531
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,917
THERE'S A DANGEROUS
GAS IN THE MINES

532
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,917
THAT AFFECTS
THE DEVELOPMENT

533
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,709
OF THE TROGLYTES
EXPOSED TO IT

534
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:12,125
FOR A PERIOD
OF TIME.

535
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,166
THIS MASK WILL PREVENT
ANY FURTHER DAMAGE.

536
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,375
GAS FROM ZIENITE?

537
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,291
YES.

538
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,208
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
SOMETHING WHICH IS NEITHER
SEEN NOR FELT

539
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,917
CAN DO SO MUCH HARM.

540
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:26,500
THAT'S TRUE.
BUT AN IDEA CAN'T
BE SEEN OR FELT,

541
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,792
AND THAT'S WHAT'S
KEPT THE TROGLYTES
IN THE MINES

542
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:30,417
ALL THESE CENTURIES--

543
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,834
A MISTAKEN IDEA.

544
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:34,208
WOULD...

545
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,667
ALL THE TROGLYTES
WEAR THESE MASKS?

546
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,166
YES. I'LL SEE TO IT

547
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:41,375
THAT THE FEDERATION
ENGINEERS
CONSTRUCT THEM.

548
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:44,375
SUPPOSE PLASUS
DOES NOT AGREE?

549
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:46,250
PLASUS IS NOT
THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT.

550
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,000
THAT IS TRUE.

551
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,709
BUT THE CITY COUNCIL...

552
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:53,041
WILL NOT LISTEN
TO TROGLYTES.

553
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,375
AS SOON AS THE
ZIENITE IS DELIVERED
TO MERAK II,

554
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,875
I'LL COME BACK.

555
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,500
I'LL REQUEST
PERMISSION

556
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,375
TO MEDIATE
FOR THE TROGLYTES.

557
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:02,125
VANNA...

558
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,333
YOU MUST TRUST ME.

559
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:10,834
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

560
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:13,667
CENTURIES AGO, STRATOS
WAS BUILT BY LEADERS

561
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,667
THAT GAVE THEIR WORD

562
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:17,417
THAT ALL INHABITANTS
WOULD LIVE THERE.

563
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,083
THE TROGLYTES
ARE STILL WAITING.

564
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,542
THE ZIENITE
CAN BE DELIVERED
IN A FEW HOURS.

565
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:23,291
YOU WON'T HAVE LONG
TO WAIT NOW.

566
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:25,375
HOURS CAN BE CENTURIES,

567
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:28,375
JUST AS WORDS
CAN BE LIES.

568
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:33,125
VANNA...

569
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:36,208
YOU MUST TRUST ME.

570
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,250
IF YOU DON'T,
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WILL DIE--

571
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,458
A WHOLE PLANET.

572
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,625
THIS ZIENITE IS ALL
THAT CAN SAVE THEM.

573
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:45,166
THIS FILTER MASK
IS ALL THAT CAN SAVE
THE TROGLYTES.

574
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:50,333
TRUST ME.

575
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,083
PLEASE.

576
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:00,417
VERY WELL, CAPTAIN.

577
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:02,625
I WILL TRUST YOU.

578
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,125
THE CONSIGNMENT LIES
DEEP IN THE MINES

579
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,917
IN A PLACE KNOWN
ONLY TO TROGLYTES.

580
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:10,542
I CANNOT DIRECT YOU.
I MUST TAKE YOU THERE.

581
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,458
YOU ASKED FOR
<i>MY</i> TRUST, CAPTAIN.

582
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:18,083
ARE YOU UNWILLING
TO GIVE YOURS?

583
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:23,250
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

584
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,542
IT'S THE SENTINEL
WITH MY REFRESHMENT.

585
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:53,667
WAIT. WE'LL NEED
A TRANSPORT PASS
TO LEAVE THE CITY.

586
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,250
MIDRO.
VANNA.

587
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:34,834
ANKA.

588
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,166
YOU HAVE RETURNED.

589
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:39,250
AND I'VE BROUGHT WITH ME
A HOSTAGE. SEIZE HIM!

590
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,166
WE HAD A BARGAIN.
WHY DID YOU BREAK IT?

591
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:46,250
DID YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULD TRUST YOU,
CAPTAIN?

592
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,917
I'M NOT SUCH A FOOL.

593
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,500
I TRUSTED YOU.

594
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,333
YOU THOUGHT
YOU WOULD TRICK ME

595
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:54,375
WITH YOUR TALK OF YOUR FILTER
AND YOUR UNSEEN GAS.

596
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:58,125
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU
ANY MORE THAN PLASUS DOES.

597
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:59,208
THEN YOU ARE A FOOL.

598
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,208
THESE MASKS
WILL FREE YOU,
JUST AS I SAID.

599
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,458
OUR WEAPONS
ARE OUR FREEDOM,

600
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:07,875
AND YOU'VE JUST FURNISHED ME
WITH TWO VERY VALUABLE ONES--

601
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:10,500
YOURSELF AND THIS.

602
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,834
HOLDING ME
WON'T HELP YOU.

603
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:13,792
MY MEN WILL STILL COME
FOR THAT ZIENITE
CONSIGNMENT.

604
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:16,291
WITHOUT YOUR
COMMUNICATOR,

605
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:18,291
YOU WILL BE HARD
TO LOCATE.

606
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:19,125
THEY'LL STILL COME.

607
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,208
PERHAPS.

608
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:25,583
IN THE MEANTIME, TASTE
OF OUR EXISTENCE, CAPTAIN.

609
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:29,291
DIG AS THE TROGLYTES DO.
AS THE TROGLYTES DO--

610
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,041
WITHOUT THAT MASK
I HAVEN'T--

611
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:40,500
WITH YOUR BARE
HANDS, CAPTAIN.

612
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:57,583

REPORTING.

614
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,834
CAPTAIN KIRK BEAMED
DOWN TO STRATOS

615
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:05,041
TO ATTEMPT TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE
OF THE REBEL TROGLYTES.

616
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:08,542
UNLESS HE HAS MADE HIS ESCAPE
FROM STRATOS TO THE MINES,

617
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:11,333
HIS LIFE IS IN DANGER
FROM THE HIGH ADVISER.

618
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:14,333
THE CAPTAIN HAS NOT INFORMED US
OF HIS PROGRESS.

619
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:18,333
FOR OUR PART,
WE MUST MAINTAIN SILENCE.

620
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:21,959
WE CAN BE OF NO HELP TO HIM
WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING HIS LIFE.

621
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:25,291
YOU DIG WELL,
CAPTAIN.

622
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:28,333
THE UNSEEN GAS
DOESN'T SEEM TO
BE HARMING YOU.

623
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,250
IT TAKES A WHILE
FOR ITS EFFECTS
TO BE NOTICED.

624
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,625
NEVERTHELESS,
YOU WON'T BE
NEEDING THIS.

625
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,959
ANKA, DEPOSIT THIS
ON THE TRANSPORT
PLATFORM

626
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:38,792
SO PLASUS WILL KNOW
WE HAVE SOMETHING
MORE VALUABLE

627
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:42,792
TO BARGAIN WITH
THAN OUR MORTAYS
AND THONGS.

628
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,667
Anka: YOU ARE CLEVER,
VANNA--VERY CLEVER.

629
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:50,333
THE SEARCHERS
WILL BE COMING
SOON, MIDRO.

630
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,166
GO TO
THE OTHER MINES

631
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:52,583
AND TELL THE TROGLYTES
TO POST WATCHES.

632
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,667
WHAT OF HIM?

633
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:57,125
I WILL SEE THAT
HE DOESN'T ESCAPE.

634
00:34:57,125 --> 00:35:00,291
IF WE KILL HIM,
THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO SEE.

635
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:03,834
A DEAD HOSTAGE
IS OF NO VALUE, MIDRO.

636
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:05,583
ONLY THE TROGLYTES
WILL KNOW.

637
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:09,500
I BROUGHT HIM HERE,
AND I WILL SAY
WHAT IS TO BE DONE.

638
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,583
YOU ARE NOT
THE ONLY DISRUPTER.

639
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:13,583
I, TOO, CAN SAY.

640
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,375
AND YOU DO NOTHING
BUT ARGUE?

641
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,542
THE SEARCHERS
WILL BE HERE SOON.

642
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:22,500
WHEN ANKA RETURNS,
WE WILL ALL SAY.

643
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,834
IS THAT WHAT
YOU DISRUPTERS
ARE BARGAINING FOR--

644
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,542
THE RIGHT TO KILL
EVERYONE?

645
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:34,500
MIDRO IS A CHILD.

646
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,583
THE MASKS
CAN CHANGE THAT.

647
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,000
RETURN TO
THE DIGGING, CAPTAIN.

648
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,625
HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN ON
KEEPING ME HERE?

649
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:49,458
PROVIDING MIDRO DOESN'T
KILL ME, OF COURSE.

650
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:52,000

IN THE MINES

651
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,750

ARE IN THE CLOUDS.

WILL GO. WE'LL DIE!

00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:29,291
INSTRUCTIONS CLEAR.
I SHALL CARRY THEM OUT
IMMEDIATELY.

679
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,000
SPOCK OUT.

680
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,083
YOU WOULD SEAL PLASUS
HERE, ALSO?

681
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:38,291
FOR WHAT PURPOSE?

682
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,875
I'M PREPARING
A DEMONSTRATION...

683
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,792
ON THE EFFECTS
OF UNBELIEVED GAS.

684
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,750
BEAM THE HIGH ADVISER
DOWN WITHOUT WARNING,
DID HE SAY?

685
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,875
THAT'S NOT AN EXACT QUOTE,
MR. SCOTT.

686
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,500
HOWEVER, IT DOES
EXPRESS THE THOUGHT.

687
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,041
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THE ADVISER'S FACE.

688
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,000
YOU WILL HAVE
THAT OPPORTUNITY.

689
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,667
THE CAPTAIN DID SAY
IMMEDIATELY, DID HE NOT?

690
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:09,083
NOW, THAT
IS AN EXACT QUOTE,
MR. SCOTT,

691
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:11,083
AND I SUGGEST YOU HANDLE
THE TRANSPORTER YOURSELF.

692
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,750
THIS COULD BE
VERY DELICATE

693
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,875
AS A PROBLEM
IN TRANSPORTING FOR US

694
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,333
AND IN DIPLOMACY
FOR THE CAPTAIN.
AYE.

695
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,375
SOMETHING'S UPSETTING
YOU, DROXINE.

696
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,625
NO, FATHER.

697
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:30,750
WHAT IS IT?
TELL ME.

698
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,250
NO, REALLY,
I'M NOT UPSET.

699
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,250
I WAS JUST STANDING HERE
LOOKING INTO SPACE

700
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,250
AND WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT
HE WOULD RETURN.

701
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,667
HE WILL NEVER RETURN.
I'VE SEEN TO THAT.

702
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:43,500
BUT THE ZIENITE
IS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM.

703
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,709
HE MUST HAVE IT.

704
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:45,834
IT WILL BE DELIVERED

705
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,458
IF WE HAVE TO KILL
EVERY TROGLYTE BELOW,

706
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,417
IT WILL BE DELIVERED.

707
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:51,000
BY THAT TIME,
IT MAY BE TOO LATE.

708
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,542
PERHAPS HE DOES
HAVE A METHOD--

709
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:54,250
HE KNOWS NOTHING

710
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,875
EXCEPT HOW TO
DESTROY OUR POWER
AND OUR SOCIETY.

711
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:00,834
I FORBID YOU EVER TO
SPEAK OF CAPTAIN KIRK,

712
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:01,959
EVEN TO THINK OF HIM.

713
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:04,667
Scotty:
TRANSPORTER ROOM
TO MR. SPOCK.

714
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,125
SPOCK HERE.

715
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,417
I'VE LOCKED INTO
THE COORDINATES

716
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:09,125
OF THE CLOUD CITY
COUNCIL GALLERY.

717
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:10,959
READY TO TRANSPORT
THE HIGH ADVISER.

718
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,375
WE HAVE TO DELAY.

719
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:14,083
WHAT'S WRONG.

720
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:16,166
I'M PICKING UP
TWO LIFE FORMS
IN THE GALLERY.

721
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:19,542
THEY ARE
INSEPARABLY CLOSE
TO ONE ANOTHER.

722
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:22,875
WE CANNOT TRANSPORT
ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER.

723
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,333
DID YOU SAY THE WORD
"IMMEDIATELY"

724
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:27,041
WAS AN EXACT QUOTE
OF THE CAPTAIN'S ORDER?

725
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:28,542
PRECISELY, MR. SCOTT.

726
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:29,959
WELL?

727
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:32,417
ARE WE GOING TO DO IT
AS IN THE ORDER?

728
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,375
UNTIL THE HIGH ADVISER
IS ALONE

729
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,875
OR CAN BE ISOLATED,

730
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,959
THE CAPTAIN
WILL HAVE TO WAIT,

731
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,041
UNLESS YOU HAVE
AN ALTERNATIVE.

732
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,166
I'LL GIVE IT
FURTHER THOUGHT.

733
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:48,709
I WASN'T THINKING
OF CAPTAIN KIRK.

734
00:39:48,709 --> 00:39:53,333
IT'S THE ONE WITH THOSE
EXQUISITELY-SHAPED EARS.

735
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,417
HIS NAME IS SPOCK.

736
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:58,792
HE'S THE ONE
I WAS THINKING ABOUT.

737
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:02,458
DID YOU KNOW THAT
HE HAS THE MOST
INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE HEARING?

738
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:06,792
WHY, I ALMOST BELIEVE
IF I STOOD HERE

739
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:08,667
AND CALLED OUT TO HIM,

740
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,458
HE WOULD HEAR MY INVITATION

741
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:13,291
TO COME AND VISIT WITH US
FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

742
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:16,333
OH, HE'S NO BETTER
THAN HIS FRIEND.

743
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:17,834
SHALL WE TRY?

744
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:19,500
WHAT IS IT?

745
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
THE DISRUPTER VANNA
HAS DISAPPEARED.

746
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
HER GUARD WAS FOUND
HALF-UNCONSCIOUS.

747
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,417
HE'D BEEN ATTACKED
BY CAPTAIN KIRK.

748
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:26,834
WHERE IS
CAPTAIN KIRK?

749
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:28,375
HE DID NOT KNOW, SIR.

750
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,667
HE DID NOT
REGAIN HIS SENSES
UNTIL I CAME TO HIS AID.

751
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:33,458
THIS IS THE KIND
OF REASON THEY USE
TO PERSUADE US.

752
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,041
THEY ARE DESPERATE.

753
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:37,792
I WILL HEAR NO MORE
DEFENSE OF THEM.

754
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:43,041
I'M SURE MR. SPOCK
WOULD NOT BEHAVE SO.

755
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,125
LEAVE HERE AT ONCE.
GO TO YOUR MUSIC.

756
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:54,041
FATHER, ARE WE SO SURE
OF OUR METHODS

757
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:56,959
THAT WE NEVER QUESTION
WHAT WE DO?

758
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,917
SPOCK TO
TRANSPORTER ROOM.

759
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,125
SCOTT HERE.

760
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,542
LOCK IN ON COUNCIL
GALLERY COORDINATES.

761
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:06,917
LOCKED IN, SIR.

762
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:07,917
ENERGIZE.

763
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,125
AYE, SIR.

764
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,792
ENERGIZING.

765
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,750
HOW ARE YOU DOING,
MR. SCOTT?

766
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,583
FINE, MR. SPOCK.
THE HIGH ADVISER

767
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:22,291
IS MATERIALIZING
ON THE PLATFORM.

768
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,542
BEAM HIM DOWN
TO CAPTAIN KIRK
IMMEDIATELY.

769
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:26,041
ENERGIZING, SIR.

770
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:29,166
HE'S ON HIS WAY
TO THE CAPTAIN.

771
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:30,750
GOOD WORK, MR. SCOTT.

772
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,625
THE ADVISER LOOKED
MIGHTY ANGRY.

773
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:35,375
I HOPE HE DOESN'T
GIVE THE CAPTAIN
TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

774
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:39,583
THE CAPTAIN WILL EMPLOY
HIS USUAL DIPLOMATIC BALM.

775
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:42,750
ABDUCTION
OF A PLANET OFFICIAL
IS A SERIOUS CRIME.

776
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,875
YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS,
I PROMISE YOU.

777
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,959
NOT UNTIL YOU'RE CONVINCED
OF THE EFFECTS

778
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:48,208
OF THE ZIENITE GAS,
MR. ADVISER.

779
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,709
WHAT EFFECTS?
I'VE BEEN HERE
NEARLY AN HOUR

780
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,125
OF YOUR EARTH TIME--
YOU AND VANNA
EVEN LONGER.

781
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,917
I SEE NO CHANGES
IN ANY OF US.

782
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,625
PERHAPS YOU NEED
CLOSER EXPOSURE.

783
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:02,083
FILL THAT CONTAINER.

784
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,291
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THAT I DIG ZIENITE?

785
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,792
I INSIST.

786
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,625
YOU WILL INDEED
PAY FOR THIS.

787
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,834
YOU, TOO, VANNA.

788
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,291
YOU, TOO. DIG!

789
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,875
[COMMUNICATOR BEEPS]

790
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:35,792
KIRK HERE. WHAT IS IT?

791
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:36,750
CONTACT CHECK, CAPTAIN.

792
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,166
IT HAS BEEN
OVER AN HOUR

793
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:39,375
SINCE YOUR LAST
COMMUNICATION.

794
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:43,041
YOUR ORDERS
ARE TO STAND BY.

795
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,166
NOW CARRY THEM OUT!
KIRK OUT.

796
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,458
STANDING BY,
CAPTAIN.

797
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:49,125
HOWEVER, LET ME
REMIND YOU WE HAVE
ONLY 5 HOURS LEFT--

798
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:55,500
THAT WAS VERY
UNLIKE THE CAPTAIN.

799
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,959
CAN THE ZIENITE
BE AFFECTING HIM?

800
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,041
Vanna: I GROW FAINT.

801
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:08,875
THE OXYGEN IS GOING.

802
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:13,625
SHE'S RIGHT.
KIRK, TRANSPORT US
OUT OF HERE.

803
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:17,166
WE'LL LEAVE
WHEN THE GAS HAS EFFECT.

804
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:19,166
IT WILL NEVER
TAKE EFFECT!

805
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,250
TRANSPORT US
OUT OF HERE!

806
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,333
DIG!

807
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,250
IMBECILE.
WE'LL DIE!

808
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,792
I SAID DIG!

809
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:35,291
I AM HIGH ADVISER
OF ALL THE PLANET.

810
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:37,417
I WILL TAKE
NO MORE ORDERS!

811
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:39,542
ONE MORE STEP
AND I'LL KILL YOU.

812
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:41,333
THE GAS. CAPTAIN,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

813
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:42,750
IT'S TAKING EFFECT!

814
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,041
CAPTAIN, YOU WERE RIGHT.

815
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,375
ARE YOU AS BRAVE
WITH MORTAY

816
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,709
AS YOU ARE
WITH A PHASER?

817
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:52,583
BOTH WILL KILL.

818
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,208
[COMMUNICATOR BEEPS]

819
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,667
Vanna:<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

820
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:42,959
<i>ENTERPRISE,</i> HELP!

821
00:44:42,959 --> 00:44:44,792
<i>ENTERPRISE!</i>

822
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:46,667
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>
<i>SPOCK HERE.</i>

823
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:48,875
Vanna: THEY'LL KILL
EACH OTHER! HELP US!

824
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,083
HELP US!

825
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:56,500
Vanna:<i> ENTERPRISE!</i>
<i>ENTERPRISE!</i>

826
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:19,542
CAPTAIN!
THE ZIENITE GAS
HAS AFFECTED YOU.

827
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:20,792
CAPTAIN!

828
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:24,709
THE ZIENITE GAS!

829
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:28,709
THE ZIENITE GAS.

830
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:30,208
LOOK OUT, JIM!

831
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,625
WELL.

832
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,542
IT SEEMS MY LITTLE
DEMONSTRATION WAS...

833
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:53,542
QUITE A SUCCESS.

834
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:04,000
I DON'T LIKE FILTERS

835
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,208
OR EVEN MASKS.

836
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:10,083
I LIKE THE WORD
"PROTECTOR"
MUCH BETTER.

837
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,542
DON'T YOU?

838
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:14,875
IT IS LESS TECHNICAL,

839
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,417
THEREFORE LESS ACCURATE,

840
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:20,583
BUT PERHAPS MORE
GENERALLY DESCRIPTIVE
OF THE FUNCTION.

841
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:23,083
IT APPEARS YOU HAVE
WHAT YOU CAME FOR
AFTER ALL.

842
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:26,542
Vanna: THE CAPTAIN
WILL HAVE HIS ZIENITE,
JUST AS I AGREED.

843
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:28,625
AGREED? THERE'S
NO SUCH WORD

844
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,417
IN THE TROGLYTE
VOCABULARY.

845
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:32,875
THE CAPTAIN WILL HAVE
HIS ZIENITE.

846
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,667
NO THANKS
TO ANY AGREEMENT
BY YOU.

847
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,291
IT HAD TO BE
OBTAINED BY FORCE.

848
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:37,667
BECAUSE IT IS
THE ONLY WAY

849
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:39,208
WE CAN OBTAIN
WHAT IS DUE US.

850
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:41,583
HOW ABOUT
YOUR EDUCATION?
WAS THAT BY FORCE?

851
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:44,667
IT SERVED<i> YOUR</i> PURPOSE
AT THE TIME.

852
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:46,000
YOU COULD HAVE HAD
THOSE FILTERS,

853
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,583
FOR ALL THE GOOD
IT WILL DO YOU.

854
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,417
THEY WILL BE
VERY EFFECTIVE, SIR.

855
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:50,542
THEY'VE BEEN
SEVERELY TESTED,

856
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:53,583
AND THE TROGLYTES
WILL NO LONGER SUFFER
FROM RETARDATION

857
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:55,166
AND EMOTIONAL
DIFFICULTIES.

858
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:56,959
THEY WILL ALL BE
LIKE HER--

859
00:46:56,959 --> 00:46:58,959
UNGRATEFUL,
VINDICTIVE.

860
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:02,917
YES. OUR DEMANDS
HAVE JUST BEGUN.

861
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,959
HERE IS THE ZIENITE,
CAPTAIN...

862
00:47:09,542 --> 00:47:12,125
JUST AS I PROMISED.

863
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:13,417
THANK YOU, VANNA.

864
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:17,709
STRATOS IS SO PLEASANT
AND SO BEAUTIFUL.

865
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,917
I THINK I'M AFRAID
TO LEAVE IT.

866
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:23,625
THERE IS GREAT BEAUTY
IN THE KNOWLEDGE

867
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:26,709
THAT LIES BELOW...

868
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:29,959
AND ONLY ONE WAY
TO REALLY EXPERIENCE IT.

869
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:32,542
I SHALL GO
TO THE MINES.

870
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:38,041
I NO LONGER WISH
TO BE LIMITED
TO THE CLOUDS.

871
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:41,208
IS...

872
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:43,542
YOUR PLANET
LIKE THIS ONE?

873
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:45,000
NO.

874
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:49,834
NO, VULCAN
IS QUITE DIFFERENT.

875
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:54,417
SOMEDAY I SHOULD
LIKE TO VISIT IT.

876
00:47:56,709 --> 00:47:59,542
PERHAPS SOME FORM
OF MEDIATION CAN BE HELPFUL

877
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:00,792
IN YOUR DIFFICULTIES.

878
00:48:00,792 --> 00:48:03,041
THE FEDERATION BUREAU
OF INDUSTRIALIZATION

879
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,041
MAY BE OF AID TO YOU.

880
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:07,625
I WILL TOLERATE
ABSOLUTELY NO INTERFERENCE.

881
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:10,333
YOU WILL NOT SET FOOT HERE
AS LONG AS I RULE!

882
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:13,041
BELIEVE ME, SIR,
I HAVE NEITHER THE TIME
NOR THE DESIRE

883
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:14,583
TO RETURN HERE.

884
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:17,625
ONLY ANSWERING
YOUR CHARGES AGAINST ME
WILL FORCE ME BACK.

885
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:19,041
AND I SHALL PRESS THEM!

886
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:20,959
YOU ARE GUILTY
OF ABDUCTION, CAPTAIN.

887
00:48:20,959 --> 00:48:22,625
AND YOU'RE GUILTY
OF ATTACKING
A STARSHIP COMMANDER

888
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:24,208
AND PLOTTING
AGAINST HIS LIFE!

889
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:27,792
CAPTAIN, PERHAPS
BOTH INCIDENTS
ARE BEST FORGOTTEN.

890
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:34,834
YES, VANNA.

891
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:39,959
THEY NEVER HAPPENED.
MR. ADVISER?

892
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,250
MR. SPOCK, LET'S GET
THAT ZIENITE DELIVERED.

893
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,625
I BELIEVE WE ONLY HAVE
3 HOURS LEFT.

894
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:53,417
2 HOURS, 59 MINUTES,
TO BE EXACT, CAPTAIN.

895
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:10,667
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>
<i>KIRK TO ENTERPRISE.</i>

896
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:13,542
MR. SCOTT, BEAM US UP.
