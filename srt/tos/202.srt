1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,970
HERE'S THE REPORT
ON POLEX 5, CAPTAIN.

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,138
THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM HAS
BEEN ALMOST THE SAME.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,224
THERE'S A STRANGE LACK
OF INTELLIGENT LIFE
ON THE PLANET.

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,519
IT BUGS
THE PERCENTAGES.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,270
BUGS THE--

6
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,522
WELL, CARRY OUT
THE STANDARD PROCEDURES

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,857
ON POLEX 4.

8
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:23,983
AYE, SIR.

9
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,526
LIEUTENANT,

10
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,736
YOU LOOK A BIT TIRED
THIS MORNING.

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,864
WELL, I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
WORKING ON THIS REPORT, SIR.

12
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,199
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
A WEE BIT OF COFFEE

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,450
TO GET YOU
BACK IN SHAPE.

14
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,035
JOIN ME, CAROLYN?

15
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,244
ALL RIGHT, SCOTTY.

16
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,874
JUST LET ME GIVE THIS
TO MR. SPOCK.

17
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,250
BONES...

18
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,044
COULD YOU GET THAT EXCITED
OVER A CUP OF COFFEE?

19
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,716
WELL, EVEN FROM HERE I CAN
TELL HIS PULSE RATE'S UP.

20
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,843
GENTLEMEN.

21
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:51,969
COME ALONG, MY DEAR.

22
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,266
I'M NOT SURE
I LIKE THAT, JIM.

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,939
WHY, BONES?
SCOTTY'S A GOOD MAN.

24
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,066
AND HE THINKS HE'S
THE RIGHT MAN FOR HER,

25
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,150
BUT I'M NOT SURE

26
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,778
SHE THINKS
HE'S THE RIGHT MAN.

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,322
ON THE OTHER HAND,
SHE'S A WOMAN--

28
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,365
ALL WOMAN.

29
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,825
MM-HMM.

30
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,493
ONE DAY SHE'LL
FIND THE RIGHT MAN.

31
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,537
OFF SHE'LL GO,
OUT OF THE SERVICE.

32
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,496
MM-HMM.

33
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,873
I LIKE TO
THINK OF IT

34
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,250
NOT SO MUCH AS
LOSING AN OFFICER
AS GAINING--

35
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,334
COME ALONG.

36
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,839
ACTUALLY, I'M
LOSING AN OFFICER.

37
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,967
ENTERING STANDARD ORBIT
AROUND POLEX 4, SIR.

38
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,677
CARTOGRAPHIC DETAIL,
STAND BY.

39
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,803
STANDING BY, SIR.

40
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,474
PRELIMINARY REPORTS,
MR. SPOCK.

41
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,518
POLEX 4--
CLASS "M" TYPE PLANET,

42
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,228
OXYGEN AND NITROGEN
ATMOSPHERE.

43
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,981
SENSORS INDICATE
NO LIFE FORMS.

44
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,025
APPROXIMATE AGE--
4 BILLION YEARS.

45
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,402
JUDGE NO REASON
FOR CONTACT.

46
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,488
IN ALL RESPECTS,
QUITE ORDINARY, CAPTAIN.

47
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,784
CARTOGRAPHIC SECTIONS,
IMPLEMENT STANDARD ORDERS.

48
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,078
Uhura: ALL CARTOGRAPHIC
STANDARDS--FULL AUTOMATIC.

49
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,039
CAPTAIN?

50
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,584
WHAT IN THE NAME OF...

51
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,340
ANALYSIS, MR. SPOCK.

52
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,425
MOMENTARILY.

53
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,513
AM I...

54
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,640
SEEING THINGS?

55
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,642
NOT UNLESS I AM,
TOO.

56
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,062
CAPTAIN,
THAT THING'S
A GIANT HAND.

57
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,659
WHAT IS IT, MR. SPOCK?

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,743
IS IT A...

59
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,704
A HAND?

60
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,707
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.
NOT LIVING TISSUE.

61
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,167
A TRICK, THEN?
A PROJECTION?

62
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,710
NOT A PROJECTION,
SIR.

63
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:49,962
A FIELD OF ENERGY.

64
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:54,925
HARD ABOUT.

65
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,010
HARD ABOUT.

66
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,100
WE CAN'T SEEM
TO GET AWAY FROM IT.

67
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:06,061
IT'S ALMOST
AS IF IT MEANS
TO GRAB US.

68
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,062
REVERSE ALL ENGINES.

69
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,229
ALL ENGINES
REVERSED.

70
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,952
WE'RE DEAD STILL,
CAPTAIN.

71
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,454
HELM DOESN'T ANSWER.

72
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,580
WE CAN'T MOVE.

73
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,977
SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

74
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:57,779
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES OF
THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE,"

75
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,364
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--

76
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,034
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

77
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,871
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

78
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,707
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN
HAS GONE BEFORE.

79
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,963
CAPTAIN'S LOG--
STARDATE 3468.1.

80
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,631
WHILE APPROACHING
POLEX 4,

81
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,383
A PLANET IN THE BETA
GEMINORUM SYSTEM,

82
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,262
THE "ENTERPRISE"
HAS BEEN STOPPED IN SPACE

83
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,223
BY AN UNKNOWN FORCE
OF SOME KIND.

84
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,348
LIEUTENANT,

85
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,017
RELAY OUR POSITION
AND CIRCUMSTANCES

86
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,602
TO STARBASE 12
IMMEDIATELY.

87
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,603
AYE, AYE, SIR.

88
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,687
MR. SULU...

89
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,899
TRY ROCKING THE SHIP.

90
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,277
FULL IMPULSE POWER
FORWARD AND BACK.

91
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,569
AYE, AYE, SIR.

92
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,988
DAMAGE REPORT
COMING IN, CAPTAIN.

93
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,781
SITUATION
UNDER CONTROL.

94
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,160
MINOR DAMAGE--
STATIONS 3, 7, AND 19.

95
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,037
SICK BAY REPORTS
5 MINOR INJURIES
ALL BEING TREATED.

96
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,705
THANK YOU.

97
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,748
MR. SULU?

98
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,000
APPLYING THRUST,
SIR.

99
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,011
NO RESULTS, CAPTAIN.
WE'RE STUCK TIGHT.

100
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,056
MR. SPOCK...

101
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,557
STATUS.

102
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,102
THE SHIP IS ALMOST
COMPLETELY ENCIRCLED
BY THE FIELD.

103
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,229
IT RESEMBLES
A CONVENTIONAL
FORCE FIELD

104
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,648
BUT ON UNUSUAL
WAVELENGTHS.

105
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,732
DESPITE ITS APPEARANCE--

106
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,067
THAT OF A HUMAN
APPENDAGE--

107
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,195
IT IS DEFINITELY NOT
LIVING TISSUE.

108
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,403
IT IS ENERGY.

109
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,488
THANK YOU.

110
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,740
MR. SULU...

111
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,079
OUR FORWARD TRACTOR BEAMS--
ADJUST TO REPEL.

112
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,080
AYE, AYE, SIR.

113
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,707
[BEEP]

114
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,708
STANDING BY.

115
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,792
ACTIVATE.

116
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,052
INEFFECTIVE,
CAPTAIN.

117
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,427
THERE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE ANYTHING

118
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,222
TO PUSH AGAINST.

119
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:32,059
CAPTAIN, A MOST
CURIOUS DEVELOPMENT
ON SCANNER 57.

120
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,601
LET'S ALL TAKE A LOOK
AT IT, MR. SPOCK.

121
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,355
SCREEN ON,
CAPTAIN.

122
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,749
ACTIVITY ON
HAILING CHANNEL 3, SIR.

123
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,958
PUT IT ON AUDIO,
LIEUTENANT.

124
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,504
THE EONS HAVE PASSED,

125
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:06,676
AND WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN
HAS COME ABOUT.

126
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,470
YOU ARE MOST WELCOME,
MY BELOVED CHILDREN.

127
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,973
YOUR PLACES AWAIT YOU.

128
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,059
RESPONSE FREQUENCY,
LIEUTENANT.

129
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,603
CALCULATED.
CHANNEL OPEN, SIR.

130
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,730
YOU HAVE LEFT
YOUR PLAINS AND VALLEYS

131
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,482
AND MADE THIS BOLD VENTURE.

132
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,527
SO IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING.

133
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,655
YOU HAVE MADE ME PROUD.

134
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,074
NOW YOU CAN REST.

135
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,658
THIS IS CAPTAIN
JAMES T. KIRK,

136
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,535
COMMANDING THE U.S.S.
"ENTERPRISE."

137
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,870
PLEASE
IDENTIFY YOURSELF.

138
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,415
WE SHALL REMEMBER TOGETHER.

139
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,542
WE SHALL DRINK
THE SACRAMENTAL WINE.

140
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,338
THERE SHALL BE
THE MUSIC OF THE PIPES.

141
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,132
THE LONG WAIT
HAS ENDED.

142
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,384
ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE
FOR STOPPING THE SHIP?

143
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:48,969
YES.

144
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,137
I CAUSED THE WIND

145
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,013
TO WITHDRAW
FROM YOUR SAILS.

146
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,723
GIVE IT BACK,
THEN WE'LL TALK.

147
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,643
IT HAS BEEN 5,000 YEARS.

148
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,314
HAVE YOU LEARNED NO
PATIENCE IN THAT TIME?

149
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,524
I DON'T KNOW
WHO OR WHAT YOU ARE,

150
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,194
BUT I MUST WARN YOU,
WE HAVE THE POWER TO
DEFEND OURSELVES.

151
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,448
IF YOU VALUE YOUR SAFETY,
RELEASE THIS SHIP.

152
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,907
YOU HAVE THE SAME FIRE.

153
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,243
HOW LIKE YOUR FATHERS
YOU ARE--

154
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:16,537
AGAMEMNON, HECTOR,
ODYSSEUS.

155
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,958
NEVER MIND
THE HISTORY LESSON.
RELEASE THE SHIP!

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,585
YOU WILL OBEY ME,

157
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,340
LEST I CLOSE
MY HAND...THUS.

158
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,429
EXTERNAL PRESSURE
BUILDING UP, CAPTAIN.

159
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,516
800 GSC
AND CLIMBING.

160
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,600
COMPENSATE.

161
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,563
1,000 GSC
AND CLIMBING.

162
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,158
AAH!

163
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,617
IT'S BECOMING
CRITICAL, CAPTAIN.

164
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,245
WE CAN'T HANDLE IT.

165
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,040
ALL RIGHT! WHATEVER
YOU'RE DOING, TURN IT OFF!

166
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,124
YOU WIN!

167
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,421
PRESSURE IS GONE,
CAPTAIN.

168
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,714
SPACE
NORMAL ON HULL.

169
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,471
THAT WAS YOUR FIRST LESSON.

170
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:15,889
REMEMBER IT.

171
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,558
CAPTAIN KIRK, I INVITE
YOU AND YOUR OFFICERS

172
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,601
TO JOIN ME,

173
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,813
BUT DO NOT
BRING THAT ONE,

174
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,565
THE ONE WITH
THE POINTED EARS.

175
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,071
HE IS MUCH LIKE PAN,

176
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,990
AND PAN ALWAYS BORED ME.

177
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,201
NO SAD FACES.

178
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:40,497
THIS IS A TIME TO
REJOICE, NOT TO FEAR.

179
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,166
YOU ARE RETURNING HOME.

180
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,960
LET YOUR HEARTS
PREPARE TO SING.

181
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,926
LET'S GO, BONES.

182
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,010
YOU IN GOOD VOICE?

183
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,721
SURE IT'S WISE,
JIM?

184
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,847
IF WE DON'T
ACCEPT HIS INVITATION,

185
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,890
WE'LL HAVE
A CRUSHED EGGSHELL

186
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,141
WHERE THIS SHIP
USED TO BE.

187
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,939
VERBOSE, ISN'T HE?

188
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,732
INSULTED, SPOCK?

189
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,816
INSULTS ARE EFFECTIVE

190
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,237
ONLY WHERE EMOTION
IS PRESENT.

191
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,988
GOOD.

192
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,199
WE'LL TACKLE HIM
TOGETHER.

193
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,910
WE ALREADY
KNOW THE QUESTIONS.

194
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,288
YOU'RE THE BEST MAN
TO FIND THE ANSWERS.

195
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,512
TRICORDERS.

196
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,680
WHAT AM I DOING
DOWN HERE, DOCTOR?

197
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,766
WELL, YOU'RE
THE A &amp; A OFFICER,
AREN'T YOU?

198
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,184
ARCHAEOLOGY,
ANTHROPOLOGY,

199
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,603
ANCIENT
CIVILIZATIONS.

200
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,645
CORRECT.

201
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,687
WELL, WE'RE GOING
TO NEED HELP

202
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,815
IN ALL
THOSE AREAS.

203
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,899
COME ON.

204
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,502
MY CHILDREN,

205
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,338
LONG HAVE I WAITED
FOR THIS MOMENT.

206
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,380
THE MEMORIES YOU BRING

207
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,091
OF YOUR LUSH
AND BEAUTIFUL EARTH,

208
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,802
THE GREEN FIELDS
AND BLUE SKIES,

209
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,888
THE SIMPLE SHEPHERDS
AND THEIR FLOCKS.

210
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,849
YOU KNOW OF EARTH?

211
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,892
YOU'VE BEEN THERE?

212
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,228
ONCE, I STRETCHED
OUT MY HAND,

213
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,896
AND EARTH TREMBLED.

214
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,940
AND I BREATHED
UPON IT,

215
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,900
AND SPRING RETURNED.

216
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:37,656
YOU MENTIONED
AGAMEMNON, HECTOR,
ODYSSEUS.

217
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,533
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THEM?

218
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,202
SEARCH YOUR MOST
DISTANT MEMORIES,

219
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,288
THOSE OF THE THOUSANDS
OF YEARS PAST,

220
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,248
AND I AM THERE.

221
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,209
YOUR FATHERS KNEW ME

222
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,793
AND YOUR FATHER'S FATHERS.

223
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,384
I AM APOLLO.

224
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,222
AND I AM THE TSAR
OF ALL THE RUSSIAS.

225
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,223
MR. CHEKOV.

226
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,641
I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN.

227
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,892
I NEVER MET
A GOD BEFORE.

228
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,269
AND YOU HAVEN'T YET.
READINGS, DOCTOR.

229
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,313
SIMPLE HUMANOID,
CAPTAIN.

230
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,233
EVIDENTLY
NOT SO SIMPLE.

231
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,317
EARTH...

232
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:20,781
MOTHER OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
OF WOMEN IN THE UNIVERSE.

233
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,951
THAT, AT LEAST,
HAS NOT CHANGED.

234
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,036
I AM PLEASED.

235
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,249
YES, MY CHILDREN.

236
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,211
ZEUS, ATHENA,
APHRODITE, ARTEMIS--

237
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,505
A GALLANT BAND
OF TRAVELERS.

238
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:39,384
WE KNEW YOUR EARTH WELL
5,000 OF YOUR YEARS AGO.

239
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,801
ALL RIGHT.

240
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,347
WE'RE HERE
AT YOUR INVITATION.

241
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,057
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING US
WHAT YOU WANT

242
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,226
WITHOUT ALL
THE OLYMPIAN GENERALITIES?

243
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,062
YOU WILL NOT
LEAVE THIS PLACE.

244
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,774
TRANSPORTER ROOM.

245
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,152
YOUR TRANSPORTATION DEVICE
NO LONGER FUNCTIONS.

246
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:02,073
[STATIC]

247
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,700
"ENTERPRISE,"
COME IN.

248
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:04,992
I WILL NOT
PERMIT THAT DEVICE

249
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,286
TO WORK,
EITHER, CAPTAIN.

250
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,832
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

251
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,710
YOU WILL WORSHIP ME,

252
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,462
AS YOUR FATHERS DID
BEFORE YOU.

253
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,925
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY GOD
AND CALL YOURSELF APOLLO,

254
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,176
THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS,

255
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,678
BUT YOU'RE NO GOD
TO US, MISTER!

256
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,055
I SAID YOU WILL
WORSHIP ME.

257
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,641
AND YOU'VE GOT
A LOT TO LEARN!

258
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,518
AND SO HAVE YOU!

259
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,646
LET THE LESSON
BEGIN!

260
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:43,782
WELCOME TO OLYMPUS,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

261
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,881
MR. SPOCK, I CAN'T CONTACT
THE LANDING PARTY.

262
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,049
ALL FREQUENCIES
ARE JAMMED.

263
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,635
TRY TO BREAK THROUGH
IT, LIEUTENANT.

264
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,052
TRANSPORTER
AND COMMUNICATIONS?

265
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,346
INEFFICIENT.

266
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,014
MR. SULU, RIG ALL
TRANSMISSION CIRCUITS

267
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,557
FOR MAXIMUM
POWER GENERATION.

268
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,058
COMPUTE FOR REVERSAL
OF POLARITY OF

269
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,602
THE FIELD
AROUND THE SHIP.

270
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,270
WORKING, SIR.

271
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,730
LIEUTENANT KYLE, I WANT A
COMPLETE SENSOR SCAN
OF THE PLANET.

272
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,106
- AYE, SIR.
- LOCATE ALL LIFE FORMS.

273
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,818
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON DOWN THERE.

274
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,376
TO COIN A PHRASE...
FASCINATING.

275
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,427
ANALYSIS.

276
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,305
LIEUTENANT PALAMIS, WHAT
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT APOLLO?

277
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,974
APOLLO--TWIN BROTHER
OF ARTEMIS,

278
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,728
SON OF THE GOD ZEUS
AND LETO, A MORTAL.

279
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,438
HE WAS THE GOD
OF LIGHT AND PURITY.

280
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,441
HE WAS SKILLED
IN THE BOW AND
THE LYRE.

281
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,736
AND...THIS THING?

282
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,904
OBVIOUSLY, HE HAS SOME
KNOWLEDGE OF EARTH--

283
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,447
HIS CLASSICAL REFERENCES

284
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,616
AND THE APPEARANCE
OF ALL THIS.

285
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,326
I THINK THE
APPEARANCE OF ALL THIS

286
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,245
IS FOR OUR BENEFIT.
BONES?

287
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,371
WELL, I CAN'T
SAY MUCH

288
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,831
TILL I CHECK OUT
THESE READINGS.

289
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:15,790
HE LOOKS HUMAN,
BUT, OF COURSE, THAT

290
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,625
DOESN'T MEAN
A THING.

291
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,920
WHATEVER HE IS, SIR,
HE SEEMS TO CONTROL A
REMARKABLE TECHNOLOGY.

292
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,338
POWER IS
WHAT HE CONTROLS.

293
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,215
YOU CAN'T DO TRICKS
LIKE THAT WITHOUT ENERGY.

294
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,550
FINE, BUT
WHAT POWER
AND WHERE IS IT?

295
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,801
SCOUT AROUND WITH
YOUR TRICORDERS.

296
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,928
FIND THE SOURCE
OF THAT POWER.
BONES.

297
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,389
YES?

298
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,184
BONES, I WONDER
IF 5,000 YEARS AGO...

299
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,771
YOU HAVE A THEORY?

300
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,980
I HAVE AN IDEA.

301
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:45,445
WHAT IF HE...IS...
REALLY APOLLO?

302
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,529
WHAT?

303
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,614
CAPTAIN.

304
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,458
I WANT FROM YOU THAT
WHICH IS RIGHTFULLY MINE--

305
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,420
YOUR LOYALTY, YOUR TRIBUTE,
AND YOUR WORSHIP.

306
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,088
MAY I
ASK WHAT YOU OFFER

307
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,383
IN EXCHANGE
FOR THIS WORSHIP?

308
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,302
LIFE IN PARADISE.

309
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,429
AS SIMPLE
AND AS PLEASUREFUL

310
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,556
AS IT WAS THOSE
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO

311
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,100
ON THAT BEAUTIFUL PLANET
SO FAR AWAY.

312
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:18,895
APOLLO...

313
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,944
WE'RE WILLING TO TALK,

314
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,113
BUT YOU'LL FIND
WE DON'T BOW

315
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,867
TO EVERY CREATURE
WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE
A BAG OF TRICKS.

316
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,620
AGAMEMNON WAS ONE
SUCH AS YOU,

317
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,746
AND HERCULES.

318
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,458
PRIDE AND ARROGANCE.

319
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,128
THEY DEFIED ME
UNTIL THEY FELT MY WRATH.

320
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,588
I WOULD LIKE
TO POINT OUT

321
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,883
THAT WE ARE QUITE CAPABLE
OF SOME WRATH OURSELVES.

322
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,427
I HAVE 430 PEOPLE
ON THAT SHIP
UP THERE.

323
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,889
NO, YOU DO NOT, CAPTAIN.
THEY ARE MINE--

324
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,432
TO SAVE, TO CHERISH,

325
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,602
OR TO DESTROY AT MY WILL.

326
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,937
BUT WHY?

327
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:01,980
WHAT YOU'VE
SAID SO FAR

328
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,439
MAKES NO
SENSE AT ALL.

329
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,909
HOW LIKE APHRODITE
AND ATHENA--

330
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,913
THE BEAUTY, GRACE--

331
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,081
AND YOU SEEM WISE
FOR A WOMAN.

332
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,794
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

333
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,880
LIEUTENANT PALAMIS.

334
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,172
I MEAN YOUR NAME.

335
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,010
CAROLYN.

336
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,595
CAROLYN.

337
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,347
YES.

338
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,017
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

339
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,602
YOU WOULD DO
APHRODITE CREDIT.

340
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,980
I WILL TELL YOU
A THOUSAND TALES,

341
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,607
STORIES OF
COURAGE AND LOVE.

342
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,027
YOU WILL KNOW WHAT IT
IS TO BE A GODDESS.

343
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,110
LEAVE HER ALONE.

344
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,613
YOU PROTEST?

345
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,533
YOU RISK MUCH.

346
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,159
AND SO DO YOU.

347
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,040
SCOTTY...

348
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,552
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

349
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,929
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

350
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,723
I'VE GROWN WEARY
OF DISCUSSION AND ARGUMENT.

351
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,017
CAPTAIN,
THE PHASERS.

352
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,607
ALL THE WORKING
PARTS ARE FUSED.

353
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,609
NONE OF YOUR TOYS
WILL FUNCTION.

354
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,238
YES.

355
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,699
YOU ARE A BEAUTY,

356
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,993
BUT LIKE ARTEMIS,

357
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,787
THE BOW ARM
SHOULD BE BARE.

358
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,795
OH.

359
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,009
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

360
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,094
YES.

361
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,556
COME.

362
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,642
SHE'S NOT GOING
WITH YOU.

363
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,727
[THUNDER]

364
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,818
HE SHALL LEARN
THE DISCIPLINE
OF THE TEMPLE.

365
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,027
SO SHALL YOU ALL.

366
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,448
COME.

367
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,617
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
CAPTAIN.

368
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,535
I'LL GO.

369
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,620
WITHOUT FEAR.

370
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,790
SHE IS FIT, INDEED.

371
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,053
BONES, HOW IS HE?

372
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,680
STUNNED
BUT COMING AROUND.

373
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,974
I'M NOT SURE IT'S
WISE TO LET HER
GO OFF LIKE THAT.

374
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,559
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
RATHER DIFFICULT
TO STOP.

375
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,769
YOU SAW HOW
CAPRICIOUS HE IS--

376
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,604
BENEVOLENT ONE MINUTE,
ANGRY THE NEXT.

377
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,230
ONE WRONG MOVE FROM
HER AND HE COULD
KILL HER.

378
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,524
MR. CHEKOV, I THINK

379
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,693
YOU BETTER CONTINUE
YOUR INVESTIGATION.

380
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,777
AYE, AYE, SIR.

381
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,197
HOW DO YOU FEEL,
SCOTTY?

382
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,366
OH, I'M TINGLING
ALL OVER.

383
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,786
DID HE TAKE HER WITH HIM?

384
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,121
IT SEEMS SO.

385
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,789
CAPTAIN, WE'VE GOT
TO STOP HIM.

386
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,207
HE WANTS HER.
THE WAY HE LOOKS AT HER--

387
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,960
MR. SCOTT,
I UNDERSTAND YOUR
CONCERN OVER HER,

388
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,211
BUT SHE VOLUNTEERED
TO GO WITH HIM,

389
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,253
HOPEFULLY
TO FIND OUT
MORE ABOUT HIM.

390
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,755
SHE'S DOING HER JOB.

391
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,050
I THINK IT'S ABOUT
TIME YOU STARTED
DOING YOURS.

392
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,259
WE'VE GOT TO
FIND OUT THE SOURCE
OF HIS POWER.

393
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,302
YOU'VE
GOT A TRICORDER.

394
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,181
USE IT IF
YOU'RE ABLE TO.

395
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,264
I'M ABLE, SIR.

396
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,725
AND ONE MORE THING--

397
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,019
I WANT NO MORE
UNAUTHORIZED ACTION

398
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,770
AGAINST APOLLO
OR WHATEVER HE IS.

399
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,105
THAT'S AN ORDER!

400
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,190
AYE, AYE, SIR.

401
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,944
BESIDES, YOU STIFF-NECKED
THISTLE HEAD,

402
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,822
YOU COULD HAVE
GOTTEN YOURSELF KILLED.

403
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:40,907
AYE.

404
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,245
SCOTTY DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN GODS.

405
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,413
APOLLO'S NO GOD...

406
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:56,172
BUT...

407
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:59,550
HE COULD HAVE BEEN
TAKEN FOR ONE, THOUGH,

408
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,634
ONCE.

409
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,223
SAY, 5,000 YEARS AGO,

410
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,516
A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED
GROUP OF SPACE TRAVELERS

411
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,562
LANDED ON EARTH AROUND
THE MEDITERRANEAN.

412
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,023
YES.

413
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,442
TO THE SIMPLE SHEPHERDS
AND TRIBESMEN

414
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,360
OF EARLY GREECE,

415
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,279
CREATURES LIKE THAT
WOULD HAVE BEEN GODS.

416
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,449
ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAD
THE POWER TO ALTER
THEIR FORM AT WILL

417
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,034
AND COMMAND
GREAT ENERGY.

418
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,204
IN FACT,

419
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,664
THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
TAKEN FOR ANYTHING ELSE.

420
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,920
READY TO REVERSE
POLARITY, MR. SULU?

421
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,797
COMPUTED AND STANDING
BY TO GENERATE, SIR.

422
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,173
ACTIVATE ALL UNITS.

423
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,970
[CRASH]

424
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,058
NO GOOD, MR. SPOCK.

425
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,810
WE DIDN'T
EVEN FAZE IT.

426
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,394
WE'RE STILL
LOCKED TIGHT.

427
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,604
CUT POWER, MR. SULU.

428
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,402
LIEUTENANT, WE MUST
RESTORE COMMUNICATIONS

429
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,113
WITH THE LANDING PARTY.

430
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,698
WELL, I'M WORKING,
SIR, BUT I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING WITH THIS.

431
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,699
OH?

432
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,784
WELL, I MIGHT BE
ABLE TO RIG UP

433
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,202
A SUBSPACE
BYPASS CIRCUIT.

434
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,703
GOOD. DO SO.

435
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,205
SENSOR REPORT, MR. KYLE.

436
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,999
WELL, I'VE LOCATED THE
LANDING PARTY, SIR, BUT

437
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,501
ONE OF THEM SEEMS SEPARATED
FROM THE OTHER FOUR.

438
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,003
AND APOLLO?

439
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,463
I'VE JUST PICKED UP READINGS
FOR OUR OWN PEOPLE, SIR.

440
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,508
MR. SPOCK, HERE'S SOMETHING.

441
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,844
THERE SEEMS TO BE
A RADIATED ENERGY PULSATION

442
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:25,928
COMING FROM THE PLANET.

443
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,013
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS, SIR.

444
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,389
ORIGIN?

445
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,309
I CAN'T SEEM TO
PINPOINT IT, SIR.

446
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,935
I WOULD SUGGEST,
MR. SULU, THAT

447
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,813
IF YOU CANNOT FIND OUT
WHERE THE POWER SOURCE IS,

448
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,898
YOU SHOULD FIND OUT
WHERE IT IS NOT.

449
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,860
A SIMPLE PROCESS
OF ELIMINATION.

450
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,069
THE WHOLE PLANET, SIR?

451
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,823
YES, SIR.
THE WHOLE PLANET.

452
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,416
OH, IT'S LOVELY.

453
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,254
I'VE KNOWN OTHER WOMEN--

454
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,256
DAPHNE, CASSANDRA...

455
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,592
BUT NONE MORE
BEAUTIFUL THAN YOU.

456
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,348
ARE YOU FRIGHTENED
OF ME?

457
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,099
FRIGHTENED?

458
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,977
NO, I DON'T
THINK SO.

459
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,187
OF COURSE, A
GIRL DOESN'T GO

460
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,980
WALKING WITH A--

461
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,065
A GOD?

462
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,651
ALL RIGHT. A GOD.

463
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,529
EVERY DAY.

464
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,405
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE OTHERS?

465
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,742
ARTEMIS, HERA?

466
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,328
THEY RETURNED
TO THE COSMOS...

467
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,331
ON THE WINGS
OF THE WIND.

468
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,665
YOU MEAN THEY DIED?

469
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,042
NO,

470
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,294
NOT AS YOU
UNDERSTAND IT.

471
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,380
WE'RE IMMORTAL,
WE GODS...

472
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,593
BUT THE EARTH CHANGED.

473
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,263
YOUR FATHERS CHANGED.

474
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:54,267
THEY TURNED AWAY UNTIL
WE WERE ONLY MEMORIES.

475
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,395
A GOD CANNOT SURVIVE
AS A MEMORY.

476
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:02,275
WE NEED LOVE,
ADMIRATION, WORSHIP,

477
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,860
AS YOU NEED FOOD.

478
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,363
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE A GOD?

479
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:10,448
IN A REAL SENSE,
WE WERE GODS.

480
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,451
WE HAD THE POWER
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

481
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,828
WE COULD HAVE STRUCK
OUT FROM OLYMPUS

482
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,415
AND DESTROYED.

483
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,960
WE HAVE NO WISH
TO DESTROY,

484
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,754
SO WE CAME HOME AGAIN.

485
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,799
IT WAS AN EMPTY PLACE
WITHOUT WORSHIPERS,

486
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,010
BUT WE HAD NO
STRENGTH TO LEAVE,

487
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,639
AND WE WAITED,
ALL OF US,

488
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,642
THROUGH THE LONG YEARS.

489
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:40,896
BUT YOU SAID
THE OTHERS DIDN'T DIE.

490
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,982
EVEN FOR A GOD,

491
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,318
THERE'S A POINT
OF NO RETURN.

492
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,903
HERA WAS FIRST.

493
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,405
SHE STOOD IN FRONT
OF THE TEMPLE

494
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,992
AND SPREAD HERSELF
UPON THE WIND--

495
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,786
THINNER AND THINNER...

496
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,456
UNTIL ONLY THE
WIND REMAINED...

497
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:04,003
BUT I KNEW
YOU WOULD COME--

498
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,588
YOU STRIVING, BICKERING,

499
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,091
FOOLISHLY BRAVE HUMANS.

500
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,718
I KNEW YOU WOULD COME
TO THE STARS ONE DAY.

501
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,680
OF ALL THE GODS,
I KNEW, AND I WAITED--

502
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,767
WAITED FOR YOU TO COME
SIT BY MY SIDE.

503
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,520
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

504
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,024
EVEN 5,000 YEARS AGO,

505
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,359
THE GODS TOOK
MORTALS TO THEM

506
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,777
TO LOVE, TO CARE FOR,

507
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,448
LIKE ZEUS TOOK
LETO, MY MOTHER.

508
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,993
WE WERE GODS
OF PASSION...

509
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,661
OF LOVE.

510
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,791
THERE IS
A REPEATED OCCURRENCE
OF REGISTRATIONS,

511
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,086
A REGULAR
PULSATING PATTERN
OF RADIATED ENERGY.

512
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,256
UNQUESTIONABLY, AN
IMMENSELY POWERFUL
FIELD OF ENERGY

513
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,342
IS BEING GENERATED
AROUND HERE
SOMEWHERE.

514
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,135
BUT WE'RE JUST
HAVING DIFFICULTY
FOCUSING ON IT.

515
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,179
APOLLO HAS NO
DIFFICULTY FOCUSING.

516
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,515
HE TAPS THAT
ENERGY, MR. SCOTT.

517
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,642
SIR, SOME CREATURES
CAN GENERATE AND
CONTROL ENERGY

518
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,311
WITH NO HARM
TO THEMSELVES--

519
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:03,770
THE ELECTRIC EEL
ON EARTH,

520
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,857
THE GIANT DRY
WORM OF ANTOS 4,
THE FLUFFY--

521
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,194
NOT THE WHOLE
ENCYCLOPEDIA, CHEKOV.

522
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,446
THE CAPTAIN REQUIRES
COMPLETE INFORMATION.

523
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:15,324
SPOCK'S CONTAMINATING
THIS BOY, JIM.

524
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:21,205
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THAT HE--APOLLO--

525
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,415
TAPS A FLOW
OF ENERGY

526
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,500
AND CHANNELS IT
THROUGH HIS BODY?

527
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:27,127
THAT WOULD SEEM
MOST LIKELY, SIR.

528
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,630
MR. CHEKOV, I THINK
YOU'VE EARNED YOUR PAY
FOR THE WEEK,

529
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,008
BUT WHERE IS THE
SOURCE OF THAT POWER?

530
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,220
NUMBER ONE ON OUR LIST
OF THINGS TO DO.

531
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,013
IS THAT ALL
YOU HAVE TO OFFER?

532
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:41,183
YES, EXCEPT MY ESTIMATION
FOR HIS PHYSICAL CONDITION.

533
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,102
IN SPITE OF APOLLO'S
BAG OF TRICKS,

534
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,770
HE COMES UP
ESSENTIALLY NORMAL

535
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,022
WITH JUST A FEW
VARIATIONS.

536
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,567
HOWEVER,
THERE'S AN EXTRA
ORGAN IN HIS CHEST

537
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,361
THAT I CAN'T EVEN
MAKE A GUESS ABOUT.

538
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:53,529
BONES,
IS IT POSSIBLE--

539
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:54,612
JIM.

540
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,542
WHERE IS LIEUTENANT
PALAMIS?

541
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:09,253
SHE IS NO LONGER
OF ANY CONCERN TO YOU.

542
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,671
YOU BLOODTHIRSTY SARACEN,
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HER?

543
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,798
SCOTTY!
SCOTTY!

544
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,975
NOT GOOD.
SEVERE SHOCK.

545
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,275
ALL RIGHT, MISTER...

546
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:34,903
YOU WANTED WORSHIPERS?
YOU'VE GOT ENEMIES.

547
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,071
YOU WANT US
TO BOW DOWN--

548
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,157
[THUNDER]

549
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,661
[GAGGING]

550
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,483
YOU WILL LEARN
DISCIPLINE.

551
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:13,567
YOU WILL LEARN...

552
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,328
CHEKOV,
GIVE ME A HAND.

553
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,376
TAKE CARE OF SCOTTY.

554
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,460
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
CAPTAIN?

555
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:32,503
WHERE'S APOLLO?

556
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,629
HE DISAPPEARED AGAIN

557
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,172
LIKE THE CAT IN
THAT RUSSIAN STORY.

558
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,799
DON'T YOU MEAN
THE ENGLISH STORY,
THE CHESHIRE CAT?

559
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,843
CHESHIRE? NO, SIR.
MINSK PERHAPS, BUT--

560
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,679
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

561
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,014
SIR, THERE IS
SOMETHING I NOTICED.

562
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,058
APOLLO
LOOKED VERY STRANGE
WHEN HE DISAPPEARED,

563
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,601
TIRED OR IN PAIN.

564
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:48,810
I DON'T KNOW IF
IT MEANS ANYTHING.

565
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,062
WHERE HE GOES,
MR. CHEKOV--

566
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,065
THAT MIGHT VERY WELL
MEAN SOMETHING.

567
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,316
[MOANING]

568
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,989
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

569
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,824
I CAN'T GET MY ARM
TO MOVE.

570
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,703
SOME NEURAL
DAMAGE.

571
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,787
WE'VE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

572
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:08,872
HOW?

573
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:15,003
WELL, LET'S ASSUME...

574
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:20,842
5,000 YEARS AGO,
CREATURES LIKE
OUR FRIEND APOLLO

575
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,012
DID INDEED VISIT EARTH

576
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:28,475
AND FORM THE BASIS OF
THE GREEK CLASSIC MYTHS.

577
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,018
MAKES SENSE.

578
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,895
MOST MYTHOLOGY HAS
ITS BASIS IN FACT.

579
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,897
NOW, IF I REMEMBER
MY ANCIENT LEGENDS,

580
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,150
THE GODS, AFTER
EXPENDING ENERGY,
REQUIRED REST,

581
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,277
EVEN AS WE HUMANS.

582
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,903
AND APOLLO'S GONE--

583
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,698
AFTER ATTACKING
YOU AND MR. SCOTT.

584
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,909
YOU THINK MAYBE HE'S OFF
SOMEWHERE RECHARGING
HIS ENERGY CELLS?

585
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,578
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

586
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,829
REMEMBER, HE'S
KEEPING A FORCE
FIELD ON THE SHIP,

587
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,873
AND HE'S EXPENDING
ENERGY DOWN HERE.

588
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,544
YOU SAID HE LOOKED
PAINED AND TIRED
WHEN HE DISAPPEARED.

589
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,212
IF WE CAN WEAR HIM
OUT, OVERWORK HIM,

590
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,880
THAT MIGHT DO IT.

591
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,842
THE TROUBLE WITH
OVERWORKING HIM IS
THAT IT CAN GET US KILLED.

592
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,637
IF WE CAN PROVOKE HIM

593
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,598
SO THAT HE STRIKES
ONE OF US AGAIN,

594
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,600
THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT HE'LL BE
DRAINED ENOUGH

595
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,184
SO THE REST OF
US CAN JUMP HIM.

596
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,936
I STILL SAY IT
CAN GET US KILLED.

597
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,689
NOT ALL OF
US, BONES.

598
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,358
WHEN HE COMES BACK,

599
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,777
IT'S A CHANCE
WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE.

600
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:31,079
PROGRESS REPORT.

601
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,249
I'M CONNECTING THE
BYPASS CIRCUIT NOW, SIR.

602
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,835
IT SHOULD TAKE
ANOTHER HALF-HOUR.

603
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,129
SPEED IS ESSENTIAL,
LIEUTENANT.

604
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,257
MR. SPOCK, I
HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS IN YEARS.

605
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,676
IF IT ISN'T DONE
JUST RIGHT,

606
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,345
I COULD BLOW THE ENTIRE
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM.

607
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,430
IT'S VERY DELICATE
WORK, SIR.

608
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,931
I CAN THINK OF
NO ONE

609
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,016
BETTER EQUIPPED
TO HANDLE IT,

610
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,309
MISS UHURA.

611
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,186
PLEASE PROCEED.

612
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,688
YES, SIR...

613
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:56,772
RIGHT AWAY.

614
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,859
PROGRESS, MR. SULU?

615
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,654
SECTORS 1 THROUGH 25
CHARTED AND EXAMINED.

616
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:06,448
NO CHANCE AT ALL
OF POWER ORIGINATING
IN THOSE AREAS.

617
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,449
CONTINUE THE SEARCH.

618
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,408
AYE, SIR.

619
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,785
14-B BY
26 INDEXED.

620
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,578
- MR. KYLE.
- YES, SIR.

621
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,039
WE'RE UNABLE
TO BREAK COMPLETELY LOOSE
FROM THIS FORCE FIELD,

622
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,166
BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO PUNCH SOME HOLES
THROUGH IT.

623
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,167
WHAT FOR, SIR?

624
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,002
TO SHOOT THROUGH.

625
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,964
IT MIGHT ALSO RELIEVE
LIEUTENANT UHURA'S
COMMUNICATIONS PROBLEM.

626
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,801
TAKE THESE EQUATIONS
TO THE NUCLEAR
ELECTRONICS LAB.

627
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,511
I WANT THEM
TO WORK ON THE PROBLEM

628
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:30,222
OF NEGATING THE FORCE FIELD
IN SELECTED AREAS.

629
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,851
NOW, IT MIGHT BE DONE
BY GENERATING A STRONG
PINPOINT CHARGE OF M-RAYS

630
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,769
ON SOME OF THESE
SELECTED WAVELENGTHS

631
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,938
AND TYING THEM IN
WITH THE COMBINED OUTPUT
OF ALL OUR ENGINES.

632
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,023
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

633
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,871
COME HERE!

634
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,332
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO ESCAPE ME.
IT'S USELESS.

635
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,459
I KNOW EVERYTHING
YOU DO.

636
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,503
I TRIED TO BE
COMPASSIONATE
TOWARD YOUR KIND.

637
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,713
YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT OUR KIND.

638
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,089
YOU KNOW ONLY
OUR REMOTE ANCESTORS

639
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,258
WHO TREMBLED
BEFORE YOUR TRICKS.

640
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,385
YOUR TRICKS
DON'T FRIGHTEN US.
NEITHER DO YOU.

641
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,470
WE'VE COME A LONG
WAY IN 5,000 YEARS.

642
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,098
AND YOU'RE STILL OF
THE SAME NATURE.

643
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,892
I COULD SWEEP YOU
OUT OF EXISTENCE

644
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,686
WITH A WAVE OF MY HAND
AND BRING YOU BACK AGAIN.

645
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,688
I CAN GIVE LIFE
OR DEATH.

646
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,691
WHAT ELSE DOES MANKIND
DEMAND OF ITS GODS?

647
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,026
MANKIND HAS NO
NEED FOR GODS.

648
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,487
WE FIND THE ONE
QUITE ADEQUATE.

649
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,324
WE SHALL NOT
DEBATE, MORTAL.

650
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,410
I OFFER YOU ETERNAL
REST AND HAPPINESS

651
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,413
ACCORDING TO
THE ANCIENT WAYS.

652
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,124
I ASK LITTLE IN RETURN,

653
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,919
BUT WHAT I ASK
FOR, I INSIST UPON.

654
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,046
APPROACH ME.

655
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,301
I SAID APPROACH ME!

656
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,803
WE'RE BUSY.

657
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,846
Look out
for the girl.

658
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,640
YOU WILL GATHER
LAUREL LEAVES,

659
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,308
LIGHT THE ANCIENT FIRES,

660
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,476
KILL A DEER,

661
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,603
MAKE YOUR
SACRIFICES TO ME!

662
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,729
APOLLO HAS SPOKEN!

663
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:01,980
GO!

664
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,357
GATHER LAUREL LEAVES?
YOU MUST BE JOKING!

665
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,067
HA HA HA HA!

666
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,820
"KILL A DEER."

667
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:08,987
THAT'S THE
FUNNIEST THING THAT
I EVER HEARD!

668
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,864
"KILL A DEER."

669
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,617
THAT'S THE
FUNNIEST THING THAT
I EVER HEARD!

670
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,243
GO AHEAD!

671
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,745
HA HA HA!

672
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,204
LIEUTENANT, GET BACK.

673
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,749
YOU SHALL REAP THE
REWARDS OF YOUR INSOLENCE!

674
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,709
WE'RE TIRED OF
YOUR PHONY FIREWORKS!

675
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,586
MORTAL, YOU
HAVE EARNED THIS!

676
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,629
NO, DON'T!

677
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:26,880
LIEUTENANT!

678
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,508
A FATHER DOESN'T
DESTROY HIS CHILDREN.

679
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,677
YOU SAID YOU WERE GENTLE
AND UNDERSTANDING.

680
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,928
LIEUTENANT!

681
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,180
HOW CAN THEY WORSHIP
YOU IF YOU HURT THEM?

682
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,431
LIEUTENANT.

683
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:41,060
APOLLO, PLEASE.
YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF LOVE.

684
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,232
PLEASE DON'T HURT THEM.

685
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,445
PLEASE?

686
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,540
I SHALL BE LENIENT
WITH YOU...

687
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,000
FOR HER SAKE.

688
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:16,054
YOU WILL MAKE PLANS
TO BRING THE REST
OF YOUR PEOPLE DOWN.

689
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,849
BE SURE YOUR
ARTISANS BRING TOOLS.

690
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,726
YOU WILL NEED HOMES.

691
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:24,604
AND YOU'LL SUPPLY
THE HERDS OF SHEEP,
AND THE PIPES WE WILL PLAY,

692
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,273
AND THE SIMPLE SKINS
WE'LL WEAR FOR CLOTHES?

693
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,483
YOU WILL DISMANTLE
YOUR SHIP

694
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,319
FOR THE SUPPLIES
YOU NEED,

695
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,405
AND I'LL CRUSH
ITS EMPTY HULL.

696
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,909
I HAVE BEEN TOO PATIENT.

697
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,662
I SHALL BE
PATIENT NO LONGER.

698
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,254
CAPTAIN,
WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING!

699
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,589
WE WERE
DOING SOMETHING

700
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,091
UNTIL OUR BRAVE LADY
STEPPED IN AND SAVED US.

701
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,509
GOT ANY MORE
GOOD IDEAS, JIM?

702
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,762
YES, I HAVE, ONE MORE.

703
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,847
AND IT DEPENDS ON
THE LIEUTENANT'S LOYALTY.

704
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,140
IF SHE FAILS US,

705
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,436
WE BETTER GET USED
TO HERDING GOATS.

706
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,648
FOOLS.

707
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,984
I OFFER THEM
MORE THAN THEY COULD KNOW,

708
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,904
NOT JUST A WORLD,
BUT ALL THAT MAKES IT UP.

709
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,239
MAN THINKS HE'S PROGRESSED.

710
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,699
THEY'RE WRONG.

711
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,242
HE'S MERELY
FORGOTTEN THOSE THINGS

712
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,454
WHICH GAVE LIFE
MEANING.

713
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,539
YOU'LL ALL BE
PROVIDED FOR,

714
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:28,167
CARED FOR, HAPPY.

715
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,088
THERE IS AN ORDER OF THINGS
IN THIS UNIVERSE.

716
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,423
YOUR SPECIES HAS DENIED IT.

717
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,716
I COME TO RESTORE IT...

718
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,386
AND FOR YOU...

719
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,893
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THE SENSITIVITY
TO UNDERSTAND,

720
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:48,521
I OFFER YOU MORE
THAN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS
HAVE EVER IMAGINED.

721
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,399
YOU'LL BECOME THE MOTHER
OF A NEW RACE OF GODS.

722
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,652
YOU'LL INSPIRE
THE UNIVERSE.

723
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,237
ALL MEN WILL
REVERE YOU...

724
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,407
ALMOST AS A GOD
YOURSELF,

725
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:03,829
AND I SHALL LOVE YOU
FOR TIME WITHOUT END,

726
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,456
WORLDS WITHOUT END.

727
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:10,376

ME AND I YOU.

TO HER?

733
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,696

736
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:42,784
22, SIR.

737
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:43,952
THEN I'D BETTER
HANDLE IT.

738
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,250
YOU ALL RIGHT?

739
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,878
OH, YES,
I'M ALL RIGHT.

740
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,171
I HAVE A MESSAGE
FOR YOU.

741
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,091

742
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,396
WELL?

743
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,066
HE WANTS US
TO LIVE IN PEACE.

744
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,568
HE WANTS
TO PROVIDE FOR US.

745
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,779
HE'LL GIVE US
EVERYTHING WE EVER WANTED,

746
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,865
AND HE CAN
DO IT, TOO.

747
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,201
ALL RIGHT, LIEUTENANT,
YOU CAN COME DOWN
FROM MOUNT OLYMPUS NOW.

748
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,285
YOU'VE GOT
WORK TO DO.

749
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,537
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

750
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,832
HE THRIVES ON LOVE,
WORSHIP, ATTENTION.

751
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,291
YES?

752
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,753
WE CAN'T GIVE HIM
THAT WORSHIP.
NONE OF US CAN,

753
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,922
ESPECIALLY YOU.

754
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,381
WHAT?

755
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,465
SPURN HIM.

756
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,177
REJECT HIM.

757
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,511
YOU MUST.

758
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,680
YOU'RE SPECIAL
TO HIM.

759
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,682
YES...

760
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:48,767
I LOVE HIM.

761
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,770
LIEUTENANT...

762
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:58,610
ALL OUR LIVES,
HERE AND ON THE SHIP,

763
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,695
DEPEND ON YOU.

764
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,072
NO, NOT ON ME.

765
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,991
ON YOU, LIEUTENANT!

766
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,743
REJECT HIM,
AND WE HAVE A CHANCE
TO SAVE OURSELVES.

767
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,996
ACCEPT HIM,
AND YOU CONDEMN
ALL OF US TO SLAVERY,

768
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,164
NOTHING LESS
THAN SLAVERY.

769
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,958
WE MIGHT NEVER GET
HELP THIS FAR OUT,

770
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:17,462
OR PERHAPS THE THOUGHT
OF SPENDING AN ETERNITY

771
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,299
BENDING KNEE
AND TENDING SHEEP
APPEALS TO YOU.

772
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,676
OH, BUT YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

773
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:28,431
HE'S KIND, AND HE WANTS
THE BEST FOR US...

774
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:31,143
AND HE'S SO LONELY.

775
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:34,729
WHAT YOU ASK
WOULD BREAK HIS HEART.

776
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:35,897
HOW CAN I?

777
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,697
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

778
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,865
YOUR HAND.

779
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,744
NOW FEEL THAT.

780
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,373
HUMAN FLESH AGAINST
HUMAN FLESH.

781
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,797
WE'RE THE SAME.

782
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,176
WE SHARE
THE SAME HISTORY,
THE SAME HERITAGE,

783
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,927
THE SAME LIVES.

784
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,306
WE'RE TIED TOGETHER
BEYOND ANY UNTYING.

785
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,849
MAN OR WOMAN,
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.

786
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,059
WE'RE HUMAN.

787
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,145
WE COULDN'T
ESCAPE FROM EACH OTHER,
EVEN IF WE WANTED TO.

788
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,855
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT,
LIEUTENANT,

789
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,440
BY REMEMBERING WHO
AND WHAT YOU ARE--

790
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,442

791
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,904
AFLOAT IN A UNIVERSE
WITHOUT END,

792
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:28,407
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT'S TRULY YOURS

793
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,744
IS THE REST
OF HUMANITY.

794
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,914
THAT'S WHERE
OUR DUTY LIES.

795
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,041
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

796
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:38,877
YES.

797
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,714
YES, I UNDERSTAND.

798
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,969
HE'S CALLING ME.

799
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,014
LIEUTENANT...

800
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,809
YOU HAVE
YOUR ORDERS...

801
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:55,894
AND YOUR DUTY.

802
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,273
YES, SIR,

AND MY DUTY.

804
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,463

TRY IT NOW, SIR.

805
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,470

00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,182

809
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,772
WE'VE PINPOINTED
A POWER SOURCE
ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE

810
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,691
WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE FORCE FIELD.

811
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:46,319
IS THERE A STRUCTURE
OF SOME SORT NEAR YOU?

812
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,071
THERE IS INDEED,
MR. SPOCK.

813
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,948
THE POWER EMANATES
FROM THERE.

814
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,991
VERY GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU DOING
ON THE FORCE FIELD?

815
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,701
WE CAN NEGATE
SECTIONS OF IT,

816
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,955
CREATING OPENINGS
THROUGH WHICH WE CAN
FIRE OUR PHASER BANKS.

817
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,581
WELL, THAT
OUGHT TO DO IT.

818
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,667
HAVE MR. SULU
LOCK ALL PHASER BANKS
ONTO THE STRUCTURE.

819
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,753
FIRE ON MY ORDER ONLY
AND CUT IT FINE.

820
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,171
WE'LL BE STANDING
NEARBY.

821
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:08,967
CAPTAIN, I WOULD RECOMMEND
A DISCREET DISTANCE.

822
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,509
I'D LOVE TO OBLIGE
YOU, MR. SPOCK,

823
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,304
BUT WE'RE NOT
ALL TOGETHER.

824
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,139
BESIDES,
WE HAVE APOLLO
TO DEAL WITH.

825
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,474
IF THAT STRUCTURE
IS THE SOURCE
OF HIS POWER,

826
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,393
I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE HE IS
WHEN WE ATTACK IT.

827
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,145
KIRK OUT.

828
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,398
BONES, DO YOU THINK
THAT MYSTERIOUS ORGAN
IN APOLLO'S CHEST

829
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,317
COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE TRANSMISSION
OF ENERGY?

830
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,277
IT DOESN'T SERVE
ANY OTHER PURPOSE
I KNOW OF.

831
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,238
CAPTAIN, WE'VE
GOT TO WAIT UNTIL
CAROLYN COMES BACK

832
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,990
BEFORE WE FIRE
ON THE TEMPLE.

833
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,283
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN TO HER

834
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,533
IF HE WERE SUDDENLY
ATTACKED.

835
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,827
SHE MIGHT
GET KILLED.

I MUST SAY, APOLLO...

838
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:50,591
THE WAY YOU APE

IS REMARKABLE,

839
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,845

SOME OTHER THINGS
I MUST KNOW--

PREPARE TO FIRE ON
MY SIGNAL. KIRK OUT.

876
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,281
[THUNDER]

877
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,454

878
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,130
[THUNDER]

879
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,965
CAPTAIN,
WE'VE GOT TO GO
AND FIND HER!

880
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,425
AND WE'VE GOT
TO BE HERE WHEN
HE COMES BACK!

881
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:56,842
BUT WHAT IF HE DOESN'T?
WHAT IF--

882
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,595
SCOTTY, JUST HOLD ON!

883
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,305
[THUNDER]

884
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:12,567
AAH!

885
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,111
AAH!

886
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,072
AAH!

887
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,031
NO!

888
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,242
- CAPTAIN!
- ALL RIGHT.

889
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,743
NO! AAH!

890
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,745
THE TEMPLE
IS HIS POWER SOURCE.

891
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,830
LET'S BRING HIM
BACK TO IT.

892
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,999
GET TO COVER.

893
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,502
MR. SPOCK,
FIRE THOSE PHASERS.

894
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,044
CAPTAIN,
YOU'RE TOO CLOSE.

895
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,088
FIRE THOSE PHASERS!
THAT'S AN ORDER,
MR. SPOCK!

896
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,554
ALL PHASER BANKS,
FIRE!

897
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,692
NO!

898
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,069
STOP!

899
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,072
STOP, I SAY!

900
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,824
ALL PHASER BANKS,
MAINTAIN FIRING RATE!

901
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,242
MORE POWER
TO THE SHIELDS.

902
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,122
STOP!

903
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,793
[THUNDER]

904
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,129
SCOTTY!

[THUNDER]

906
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,474

908
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,353
I COMMAND IT!

909
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,355
ALL BANKS MAINTAIN
FIRING RATE.

910
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:33,772
MAINTAINING, SIR.

911
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,110
STOP!

912
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,821
STOP!

913
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,534
STOP!

914
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,364
I WOULD HAVE CHERISHED YOU,

915
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,158
CARED FOR YOU.

916
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:12,997
I WOULD HAVE LOVED YOU
AS A FATHER LOVES HIS CHILDREN.

917
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,502
DID I ASK SO MUCH?

918
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,422
WE'VE OUTGROWN YOU.

919
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,215
YOU ASKED
FOR SOMETHING

920
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,009
WE CAN NO
LONGER GIVE.

921
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,097
CAROLYN...

922
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,101
I LOVED YOU.

923
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,732
I WOULD HAVE MADE
A GODDESS OF YOU.

924
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,609
I'VE SHOWN YOU
MY OPEN HEART.

925
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,031
SEE WHAT YOU'VE
DONE TO ME.

926
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,502
ZEUS...

927
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,713
HERMES...

928
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,089
HERA...

929
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,384
APHRODITE...

930
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,552
YOU WERE RIGHT.

931
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,599
ATHENA...

932
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,685
YOU WERE RIGHT.

933
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,563
THE TIME HAS PASSED.

934
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,439
THERE IS NO ROOM
FOR GODS.

935
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,194
FORGIVE ME,

936
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:28,614
MY OLD FRIENDS.

937
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:29,699
TAKE ME.

938
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,245
TAKE ME.

939
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:38,332
TAKE ME.

[CRYING]

941
00:48:56,933 --> 00:49:00,396
I WISH WE HADN'T
HAD TO DO THIS.

942
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,732
SO DO I.

943
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:05,526
THEY GAVE US
SO MUCH.

944
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:06,652
THE GREEK
CIVILIZATION,

945
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,654
MUCH OF OUR CULTURE
AND PHILOSOPHY

946
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:11,282
CAME FROM A WORSHIP
OF THOSE BEINGS.

947
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:15,077
IN A WAY, THEY BEGAN
THE GOLDEN AGE.

948
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,248
WOULD IT HAVE
HURT US, I WONDER...

949
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,293
JUST TO HAVE GATHERED
A FEW LAUREL LEAVES?
