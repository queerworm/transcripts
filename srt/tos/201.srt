1
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,011
OH, CAPTAIN.

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,973
GOT A MINUTE?

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,182
A MINUTE.

4
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,308
IT'S SPOCK.

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,352
HAVE YOU NOTICED
ANYTHING STRANGE
ABOUT HIM?

6
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,937
NO, NOTHING
IN PARTICULAR. WHY?

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:23,524
WELL, IT'S NOTHING
I CAN PINPOINT
WITHOUT AN EXAMINATION,

8
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,443
BUT HE'S BECOME
INCREASINGLY RESTIVE.

9
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,655
IF HE WERE NOT A VULCAN,
I'D ALMOST SAY NERVOUS.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,615
AND FOR ANOTHER THING,
HE'S AVOIDING FOOD.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,535
I CHECKED, AND HE HASN'T
EATEN AT ALL IN THREE DAYS.

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,495
THAT JUST SOUNDS
LIKE MR. SPOCK

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,873
IN ONE OF HIS
CONTEMPLATIVE
PHASES.

14
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,583
MISS CHAPEL.

15
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:44,753
DR. McCOY.

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:45,754
CAPTAIN.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,922
CAPTAIN.

18
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,883
WHAT'S THIS?

19
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,217
OH, UH...

20
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,804
OH! VULCAN
PLOMIK SOUP.

21
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,263
AND I'LL BET
YOU MADE IT, TOO.

22
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,807
YOU NEVER GIVE UP
HOPING, DO YOU?

23
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,352
WELL, UH, MR. SPOCK HASN'T
BEEN EATING, DOCTOR,

24
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,688
AND I--I JUST HAPPENED
TO NOTICE.

25
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,105
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

26
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,066
CARRY ON,
MISS CHAPEL.

27
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,699
BONES,
I'M A BUSY MAN.

28
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,492
JIM, WHEN I
SUGGESTED TO SPOCK

29
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,494
THAT IT WAS TIME
FOR HIS ROUTINE
CHECK-UP,

30
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,538
YOUR LOGICAL,
UNEMOTIONAL
FIRST OFFICER

31
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,498
TURNED TO ME
AND SAID,

32
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,585
"YOU WILL CEASE TO
PRY INTO MY PERSONAL
MATTERS, DOCTOR,

33
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,755
OR I SHALL CERTAINLY
BREAK YOUR NECK."

34
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,881
SPOCK SAID THAT?

35
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,215
Spock:
WHAT IS THIS?

36
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,132
Chapel: AAH!

37
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,468
DON'T KEEP PRYING!

38
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,346
IF I WANT ANYTHING
FROM YOU,
I'LL ASK FOR IT!

39
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,560
CAPTAIN, I SHOULD
LIKE TO REQUEST

40
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,562
A LEAVE OF ABSENCE
ON MY HOME PLANET.

41
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:44,271
ON OUR
PRESENT COURSE,

42
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,231
YOU CAN DIVERT
TO VULCAN

43
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,316
WITH A LOSS OF BUT
2.8 LIGHT DAYS.

44
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,277
SPOCK, WHAT THE DEVIL
IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

45
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,987
I HAVE MADE
MY REQUEST,
CAPTAIN.

46
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,949
ALL I REQUIRE
FROM YOU IS THAT
YOU ANSWER IT--

47
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,784
YES OR NO?

48
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:16,136
Captain Kirk:<i> SPACE--</i>
<i>THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

49
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,771
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE.

50
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,439
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

51
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,650
<i>TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>STRANGE NEW WORLDS...</i>

52
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:34,071
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...</i>

53
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,658
<i>TO BOLDLY GO WHERE</i>
<i>NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.</i>

54
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,243
ALL RIGHT, SPOCK,
LET'S HAVE IT.

55
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,830
IT IS UNDIGNIFIED
FOR A WOMAN

56
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,749
TO PLAY SERVANT
TO A MAN
WHO IS NOT HERS.

57
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,293
I'M MORE INTERESTED
IN YOUR REQUEST
FOR SHORE LEAVE.

58
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,252
IN ALL THE YEARS--

59
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,295
YOU HAVE MY REQUEST,
CAPTAIN.

60
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,090
WILL YOU GRANT IT
OR NOT?

61
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,052
IN ALL THE YEARS
THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU,

62
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,679
YOU'VE NEVER ASKED
FOR A LEAVE OF ANY SORT.

63
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,181
IN FACT,
YOU'VE REFUSED THEM.

64
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,473
WHY NOW?

65
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,643
CAPTAIN, SURELY
I HAVE ENOUGH LEAVE
TIME ACCUMULATED.

66
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,980
AGREED, BUT THAT ISN'T
THE QUESTION, IS IT?

67
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,153
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM
OF SOME SORT--

68
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:56,778
ILLNESS IN THE FAMILY--

69
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,279
NO.

70
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,490
NOTHING OF THAT NATURE,
CAPTAIN.

71
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,785
THEN, SINCE WE'RE
HEADED FOR ALTAIR 6,

72
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,871
AND SINCE
THE SHORE FACILITIES
THERE ARE EXCELLENT--

73
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,998
NO! I MUST--

74
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,338
I WISH TO TAKE
MY LEAVE ON VULCAN.

75
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:30,311
SPOCK, I'M ASKING YOU...

76
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,688
WHAT'S WRONG?

77
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,025
I NEED...REST.

78
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:40,948
I'M ASKING YOU TO
ACCEPT THAT ANSWER.

79
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,330
BRIDGE...HELM.

80
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,791
Sulu:<i> YES, CAPTAIN?</i>

81
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,710
ALTER COURSE TO VULCAN,

82
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,962
INCREASE SPEED
TO WARP 4.

83
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,880
<i>AYE, SIR.</i>

84
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,429
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

85
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,143
I SUPPOSE MOST OF US
OVERLOOK THE FACT
THAT EVEN VULCANS

86
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,519
AREN'T INDESTRUCTIBLE.

87
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,151
NO.

88
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,575
WE'RE NOT.

89
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,705

109
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,380
NECESSARY
FOR COMPLIANCE.

110
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,885
WE'LL HAVE TO HEAD
DIRECTLY THERE AT, UH...

111
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,970
WARP 6, SIR.

112
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,139
INSUFFICIENT TIME
TO STOP OFF AT VULCAN.

113
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,810
HEAD DIRECTLY
FOR ALTAIR 6.

114
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,436
SAILOR'S LUCK,
MR. SPOCK.

115
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,939
OR, AS ONE OF
FINAGLE'S LAWS
PUTS IT--

116
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,816
"ANY HOME PORT
THE SHIP MAKES

117
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,735

NOT MINE."

118

THE NEW PRESIDENT
OF ALTAIR 6

119
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,487
WANTS TO GET
HIMSELF LAUNCHED
A WEEK EARLY,

120
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,948
SO WE HAVE
TO BE THERE
A WEEK EARLY.

121
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,325
DON'T WORRY.

122
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,285
I'LL SEE
THAT YOU GET
YOUR LEAVE

123
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,330
AS SOON AS
WE'RE FINISHED.

124
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,624

CHEKOV HERE.

127
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,523
MR. CHEKOV, HOW LATE
WILL WE ARRIVE
FOR THE CEREMONIES

128
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,483
IF WE INCREASE
SPEED TO MAXIMUM

129
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,320
AND DIVERT TO VULCAN
JUST LONG ENOUGH
TO DROP OFF MR. SPOCK?

130
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,655
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
CAPTAIN.

131
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,117
HOW FAR BEHIND SCHEDULE WILL
DIVERTING TO VULCAN PUT US?

132
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,619
WE'RE ON COURSE
FOR VULCAN, CAPTAIN,

133
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,871
AS MR. SPOCK ORDERED.

134
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,165
THANK YOU, MR. CHEKOV.

135
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,375
KIRK OUT.

136
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,798
MR. SPOCK.

137
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,012
COME WITH ME,
PLEASE.

138
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,152
DECK FIVE.

139
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,948
YOU CHANGED COURSE
FOR VULCAN, MR. SPOCK.

140
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,116
WHY?

141
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,617
CHANGED
THE COURSE?

142
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,121
DO YOU DENY IT?

143
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,291
NO. NO, BY NO MEANS,
CAPTAIN.

144
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,169
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE.

145
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,629
THEN WHY DID YOU DO IT?

146
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,633
CAPTAIN, I ACCEPT,
ON YOUR WORD, THAT I DID IT,

147
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,595
BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHY,
NOR DO I REMEMBER DOING IT.

148
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,350
CAPTAIN,
LOCK ME AWAY.

149
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,893
I DO NOT WISH
TO BE SEEN.

150
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,437
I C-CANNOT.

151
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,648
NO VULCAN COULD
EXPLAIN FURTHER.

152
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,318
I'M TRYING
TO HELP YOU, SPOCK.

153
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,278
ASK ME NO
FURTHER QUESTIONS.

154
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,737
I WILL NOT ANSWER.

155
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,909
I ORDER YOU TO REPORT
TO THE SICK BAY.

156
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,162
SICK BAY?

157
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,998
COMPLETE EXAMINATION.
McCOY'S WAITING.

158
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,656
OH, COME IN, SPOCK.

159
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,616
I'M ALL READY FOR YOU.

160
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:42,374
MY ORDERS WERE TO
REPORT TO SICK BAY,
DOCTOR.

161
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,459
I HAVE DONE SO.

162
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,128
AND NOW I'LL GO
TO MY QUARTERS.

163
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,214
MY ORDERS WERE TO GIVE YOU
A THOROUGH PHYSICAL.

164
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,341
IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED,

165
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:55,387
I HAVE TO ANSWER TO
THE SAME COMMANDING
OFFICER THAT YOU DO.

166
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,475
COME ON, SPOCK.

167
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,020
YIELD TO THE LOGIC
OF THE SITUATION.

168
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,357
VERY WELL, DOCTOR.

169
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,984
EXAMINE ME...

170
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,363
FOR ALL THE GOOD
IT'LL DO EITHER OF US.

171
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,666
HOW DO YOU
FIGURE IT, CHEKOV?

172
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,043
FIRST WE'RE GOING
TO VULCAN,

173
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,669
THEN WE'RE
GOING TO ALTAIR,

174
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,630
THEN WE'RE HEADED
TO VULCAN AGAIN,

175
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,049
AND NOW WE'RE HEADED
BACK TO ALTAIR.

176
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,177
I THINK I'M GOING
TO GET SPACESICK.

177
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,723
JIM, YOU'VE GOT TO
GET SPOCK TO VULCAN.

178
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,143
BONES, I WILL, I WILL.
AS SOON AS THIS
MISSION IS--

179
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,019
NO. NOW, RIGHT AWAY.

180
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,439
IF YOU DON'T
GET HIM TO VULCAN
WITHIN A WEEK,

181
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,566
8 DAYS AT THE
OUTSIDE, HE'LL DIE.

182
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,111
HE'LL DIE, JIM.

183
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,664
WHY...

184
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,291
MUST HE DIE?

185
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,459
WHY WITHIN EIGHT DAYS?

186
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,002
EXPLAIN.

187
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,045
I DON'T KNOW.

188
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,257
YOU...KEEP SAYING THAT.

189
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,217
ARE YOU A DOCTOR,
OR AREN'T YOU?

190
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,639
THERE'S A GROWING
IMBALANCE OF
BODY FUNCTIONS...

191
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,642
AS IF IN OUR BODIES
HUGE AMOUNTS
OF ADRENALIN

192
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,811
WERE CONSTANTLY
BEING PUMPED INTO
OUR BLOODSTREAMS.

193
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,564
NOW I CAN'T TRACE IT
DOWN IN MY BIOCOMPS,

194
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,774
SPOCK WON'T TELL ME
WHAT IT IS,

195
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,943
BUT IF IT ISN'T
STOPPED SOMEHOW,

196
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:38,532
THE PHYSICAL AND
EMOTIONAL PRESSURES
WILL SIMPLY KILL HIM.

197
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,913
YOU SAY YOU'RE CONVINCED
HE KNOWS WHAT IT IS?

198
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,415
HE DOES...

199
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,834
AS HE'S AS
TIGHT-LIPPED
ABOUT IT

200
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,086
AS AN ALDEBERON
SHELLMOUTH.

201
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,173
NO USE TO
ASK HIM, JIM.

202
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,924
HE WON'T TALK.

203
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,519
[DOORBELL RINGS]

204
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,647

205
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,149
STAY.

206
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,531
McCOY HAS GIVEN ME
HIS MEDICAL EVALUATION
OF YOUR CONDITION.

207
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,825
HE SAYS YOU'RE
GOING TO DIE UNLESS
SOMETHING IS DONE.

208
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,286
WHAT?

209
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,125
IS IT SOMETHING
ONLY YOUR PLANET
CAN DO FOR YOU?

210
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,878
SPOCK!

211
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,512
YOU'VE BEEN CALLED
THE BEST FIRST OFFICER
IN THE FLEET.

212
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,849
THAT'S AN ENORMOUS
ASSET TO ME.

213
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,604
IF I HAVE TO LOSE
THAT FIRST OFFICER,
I WANT TO KNOW WHY.

214
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,699
IT IS A THING NO
OUTWORLDER MAY KNOW...

215
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:07,954
EXCEPT THOSE VERY FEW
WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED.

216
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,706
A VULCAN UNDERSTANDS,

217
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,335
BUT EVEN WE
DO NOT SPEAK OF IT
AMONG OURSELVES.

218
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:19,048
IT IS A DEEPLY
PERSONAL THING.

219
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,841
CAN YOU SEE THAT,
CAPTAIN,

220
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,677
AND UNDERSTAND?

221
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,053
NO, I DO NOT
UNDERSTAND.

222
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,263
EXPLAIN.

223
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,056

AN ORDER.

224
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,144
CAPTAIN, THERE ARE SOME
THINGS WHICH TRANSCEND

225
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,396
EVEN THE DISCIPLINE
OF THE SERVICE.

226
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,531
WOULD IT HELP
IF I TOLD YOU

227
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:48,495
THAT I'LL TREAT
THIS AS TOTALLY
CONFIDENTIAL?

228
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,880
IT HAS TO DO WITH...

229
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,716
BIOLOGY.

230
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,094
WHAT?

231
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,929
BIOLOGY.

232
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,687
WHAT KIND
OF BIOLOGY?

233
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,438
VULCAN BIOLOGY.

234
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:20,276
YOU MEAN
THE BIOLOGY
OF VULCANS?

235
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,944
BIOLOGY AS IN...

236
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,071

237
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,702
WELL, UH...

238
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,622
THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE EMBARRASSED
ABOUT IT, MR. SPOCK.

239
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,666
IT HAPPENS
TO THE BIRDS
AND THE BEES.

240
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,878
THE BIRDS AND THE BEES
ARE NOT VULCANS, CAPTAIN.

241
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,465
IF THEY WERE...

242
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,051
IF ANY CREATURE
AS PROUDLY LOGICAL AS US

243
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,680
WERE TO HAVE THEIR LOGIC
RIPPED FROM THEM

244
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,599
AS THIS TIME DOES TO US...

245
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,149
HOW DO VULCANS
CHOOSE THEIR MATES?

246
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,193
HAVEN'T YOU WONDERED?

247
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:09,659
I GUESS THE REST
OF US ASSUME
THAT IT'S DONE...

248
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,119
QUITE LOGICALLY.

249
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,330
NO.

250
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,505
NO.

251
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,799
IT IS NOT.

252
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,387
WE SHIELD IT
WITH A RITUAL...

253
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,724
AND CUSTOMS SHROUDED
IN ANTIQUITY.

254
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,936
YOU HUMANS
HAVE NO CONCEPTION.

255
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,233
IT STRIPS OUR MINDS
FROM US.

256
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,653
IT BRINGS A MADNESS
WHICH RIPS AWAY

257
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,366
OUR VENEER
OF CIVILIZATION.

258
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,120
IT IS THE
<i>POHN FAHRR...</i>

259

THE TIME OF MATING.

260
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,468
THERE ARE PRECEDENTS

OF REGULUS 5.

262
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,722
ONCE EACH 11 YEARS

263
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:17,059
THEY MUST RETURN
TO THE CAVERNS
WHERE THEY HATCHED.

264
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,480
ON YOUR EARTH,
THE SALMON...

265
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,817
THEY MUST RETURN
TO THAT ONE STREAM

266
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,902
WHERE THEY WERE BORN

267
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,863
TO SPAWN...

268
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,616
OR DIE IN TRYING.

269
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,412
BUT YOU'RE NOT
A FISH, MR. SPOCK.
YOU'RE--

270
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,916
NO. NOR AM I MAN.

271
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,084
I'M A VULCAN.

272
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,255
I'D HOPED I WOULD
BE SPARED THIS,

273
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,049
BUT THE ANCIENT DRIVES
ARE TOO STRONG.

274
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,261
EVENTUALLY,
THEY CATCH UP WITH US,

275
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,683
AND WE ARE DRIVEN BY
FORCES WE CANNOT CONTROL

276
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:02,647
TO RETURN HOME
AND TAKE A WIFE...

277
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,732
OR DIE.

278
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,666
I HAVEN'T HEARD

279
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,042

00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,297

00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,274
MAYBE YOU OUGHT
TO PLOT A COURSE

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,609

A MOST UNUSUAL REQUEST.

294
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,503
I'M AWARE
OF THAT, SIR,

295
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,380
BUT IT'S OF
THE UTMOST
IMPORTANCE.

296
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,757
YOU MUST GIVE ME
PERMISSION TO DIVERT
TO VULCAN.

297
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,843

WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT.

I CAN'T, SIR,

00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,056
BUT BELIEVE ME,
I WOULDN'T MAKE
SUCH A REQUEST--

300
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,600
ALTAIR 6

INTERPLANETARY CONFLICT.

303
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:29,191
THIS INAUGURATION WILL STABILIZE
THE ENTIRE ALTAIR SYSTEM.

304
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,486

VERY DIPLOMATIC--

BUT I COULDN'T
HEAR YOU.

345
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,591
VULCAN.

346
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,511
MISS CHAPEL.

347
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,638
MY NAME IS CHRISTINE.

348
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,266
YES, I KNOW,
CHRISTINE.

349
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,064
WOULD YOU MAKE
ME SOME OF THAT
PLOMIK SOUP?

350
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,779
OH, I'D BE VERY GLAD
TO DO THAT, MR. SPOCK.

351
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,926
BRIDGE.

352
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,054
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT
YOU HAVE SURMISED
MY PROBLEM, DOCTOR.

353
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,848
MY COMPLIMENTS
ON YOUR INSIGHT.

354
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:53,062
CAPTAIN, THERE IS
A THING THAT HAPPENS
TO VULCANS AT THIS TIME.

355
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,773
ALMOST AN INSANITY,
WHICH YOU WOULD NO DOUBT
FIND DISTASTEFUL.

356
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,524
WILL I?

357
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,569
YOU'VE BEEN MOST
PATIENT WITH MY
KINDS OF MADNESS.

358
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:05,825
THEN WOULD YOU BEAM DOWN
TO THE PLANET'S SURFACE
AND STAND WITH ME?

359
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,618
THERE IS
A BRIEF CEREMONY.

360
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,953
IS IT PERMITTED?

361
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,997
IT IS MY RIGHT.

362
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:14,708
BY TRADITION,
THE MALE IS ACCOMPANIED
BY HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS.

363
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,586
THANK YOU, MR. SPOCK.

364
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:23,843
I ALSO REQUEST McCOY
TO ACCOMPANY ME.

365
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,095
I SHALL BE
HONORED, SIR.

366
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,182
CAPTAIN.

367
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,851
WE'RE STANDING BY
ON VULCAN HAILING
FREQUENCIES, SIR.

368
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,602
OPEN THE CHANNEL,
LIEUTENANT.

369
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,231
VULCAN SPACE CENTRAL,
THIS IS THE<i> U.S.S. ENTERPRISE,</i>

370
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,900
REQUESTING PERMISSION
TO ASSUME STANDARD ORBIT.

371
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,820

375
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:49,952
THIS IS SPOCK.

376

<i>STAND BY TO ACTIVATE</i>
<i>YOUR CENTRAL VIEWER,</i>
<i>PLEASE.</i>

377
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,086
DOCTOR,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

378
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,801
SPOCK...

379
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,512
IT IS I.

380
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,681
T'PRING...

381
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,060
PARTED FROM ME
AND NEVER PARTED.

382
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:19,023
NEVER AND ALWAYS
TOUCHING AND TOUCHED.

383
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,984
WE MEET AT
THE APPOINTED PLACE.

384
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,028
SPOCK...

385
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:28,448
PARTED FROM ME
AND NEVER PARTED,

386
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,953
NEVER AND ALWAYS
TOUCHING AND TOUCHED.

387
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,413
I AWAIT YOU.

388
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,917
SHE'S LOVELY, MR. SPOCK.

389
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,210
WHO IS SHE?

390
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,879
SHE IS T'PRING...

391
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,797
MY WIFE.

392
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,015
THIS IS THE LAND
OF MY FAMILY.

393
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:40,813
IT HAS BEEN HELD BY US
FOR MORE THAN 2,000 EARTH YEARS.

394
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:44,191
THIS IS OUR PLACE
OF<i> KOONUT KALIFFEE.</i>

395
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,158
HE CALLED IT
<i>KOONUT</i> WHAT?

396
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,576
HE DESCRIBED IT
TO ME AS MEANING

397
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,911
"MARRIAGE
OR CHALLENGE."

398
00:24:56,036 --> 00:25:00,498
IN THE DISTANT PAST,
VULCANS KILLED
TO WIN THEIR MATES.

399
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,585
THEY STILL GO MAD
AT THIS TIME.

400
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,799
PERHAPS IT'S
THE PRICE THEY PAY

401
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,135
FOR HAVING NO EMOTIONS
THE REST OF THE TIME.

402
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,971
LOVELY. I WISH
THE BREEZE
WERE COOLER.

403
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,389
YEAH.
"HOT AS VULCAN."

404
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,266
NOW I UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT PHRASE MEANS.

405
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,059
THE ATMOSPHERE'S
THINNER THAN EARTH.

406
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,438
[GONG]

407
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:26,524
I WONDER WHEN HIS
T'PRING ARRIVES.

408
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,782
THE MARRIAGE PARTY
APPROACHES.

409
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,868
I HEAR THEM.

410
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:36,369
MARRIAGE PARTY?

411
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:39,413
YOU SAID T'PRING
WAS YOUR WIFE.

412
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,166
BY OUR PARENTS'
ARRANGEMENT...

413
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,168
A CEREMONY...

414
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,963
WHILE WE WERE BUT
7 YEARS OF AGE...

415
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,341
LESS
THAN A MARRIAGE...

416
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,550
BUT MORE
THAN A BETROTHAL.

417
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,514
ONE TOUCHES
THE OTHER

418
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,642
IN ORDER TO FEEL
EACH OTHER'S
THOUGHTS.

419
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:05,814
IN THIS WAY,
OUR MINDS WERE
LOCKED TOGETHER...

420
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,442
SO THAT,
AT THE PROPER TIME,

421
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,444
WE WOULD
BOTH BE DRAWN

422
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:14,781
TO...
KOONUT KALIFFEE.

423
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,658
[BELLS RINGING]

424
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,617
BONES...YOU KNOW
WHO THAT IS?

425
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,045
T'PAU...

426
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,466
THE ONLY PERSON
TO EVER TURN
DOWN A SEAT

427
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,467
ON THE FEDERATION
COUNCIL.

428
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:19,054
T'PAU? OFFICIATING
AT SPOCK'S WEDDING?

429
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:23,142
HE NEVER MENTIONED
THAT HIS FAMILY
WAS THIS IMPORTANT.

430
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,273
SPOCK...

431
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,734
ARE OUR CEREMONIES
FOR OUTWORLDERS?

432
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,112
THEY ARE
NOT OUTWORLDERS.

433
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,406
THEY ARE MY FRIENDS.

434
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:23,327
I AM PERMITTED THIS.

435
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,921
THIS IS KIRK.

436
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,798
MA'AM.

437
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,971
AND THEE ARE CALLED?

438
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,640
LEONARD McCOY, MA'AM.

439
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:51,355
THEE NAMES
THESE OUTWORLDERS
FRIENDS.

440
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,191
HOW DOES THEE PLEDGE
THEIR BEHAVIOR?

441
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,276
WITH MY LIFE, T'PAU.

442
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,158
WHAT THEY ARE
ABOUT TO SEE...

443
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,078
COMES DOWN
FROM THE TIME
OF THE BEGINNING...

444
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,415
WITHOUT CHANGE.

445
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,417
THIS IS
THE VULCAN HEART.

446
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,377
THIS IS
THE VULCAN SOUL.

447
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,629
THIS IS OUR WAY.

448
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,759
<i>KALIFFARR.</i>

449
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,569
<i>KALIFFEE!</i>

450
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,355
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

451
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,357
SHE CHOOSES
THE CHALLENGE.

452
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,525
WITH HIM?

453
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:23,447
HE ACTS ONLY
IF COWARDICE
IS SEEN.

454
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,909
SHE WILL CHOOSE
HER CHAMPION.

455
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,456
SPOCK...

456
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,668
DO NOT ATTEMPT
TO SPEAK AT HIM,
KIRK.

457
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:39,755
HE IS DEEP
IN THE<i> PLAKTAU...</i>

458
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,757
THE BLOOD FEVER.

459
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,260
HE WILL NOT SPEAK
WITH THEE AGAIN...

460
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,054
UNTIL HE HAS
PASSED THROUGH

461
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,973
WHAT IS TO COME.

462
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,810
IF THEE WISHES
TO DEPART...

463
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,561
THEE MAY LEAVE NOW.

464
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,360
WE'LL STAY.

465
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:05,781
SPOCK CHOSE
HIS FRIENDS WELL.

466
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,783
MA'AM, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND. ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY

467
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,284
THAT SHE
REJECTED HIM,

468
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,994
THAT SHE DOESN'T
WANT HIM?

469
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,038
HE WILL HAVE TO
FIGHT FOR HER.

470
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,623
IT IS HER RIGHT.

471
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,630
T'PRING, THEE HAS CHOSEN
THE<i> KALIFFEE,</i>

472
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,507
THE CHALLENGE.

473
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,091
THEE ARE PREPARED

474
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,636
TO BECOME THE PROPERTY
OF THE VICTOR?

475
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,555
I AM PREPARED.

476
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,230
SPOCK, DOES THEE
ACCEPT CHALLENGE,

477
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:41,316
ACCORDING TO OUR LAWS
AND CUSTOMS?

478
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,624
DO YOU THINK SPOCK
CAN TAKE HIM?

479
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,545
I DOUBT IT...

480
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,547
NOT IN HIS PRESENT
CONDITION.

481
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:08,427
T'PRING, THEE WILL
CHOOSE THY CHAMPION.

482
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,061
AS IT WAS IN THE DAWN
OF OUR DAYS,

483
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,938
AS IT IS TODAY,

484
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,982
AS IT WILL BE
FOR ALL TOMORROWS,

485
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,860
I MAKE MY CHOICE.

486
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,324
THIS ONE.

487
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,540
NO! I AM
TO BE THE ONE.

488
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,166
IT WAS AGREED.

489
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:40,834
BE SILENT!

490
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,294

491
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,379
I HAVE MADE
THE ANCIENT CLAIM.

492
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,048
I CLAIM THE RIGHT.
THE WOMAN IS--

493
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,300
<i>KROYKAH!</i>

KIRK...

496
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,190
T'PRING IS WITHIN
HER RIGHTS,

497
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:08,361
BUT OUR LAWS AND CUSTOMS
ARE NOT BINDING ON THEE.

498
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,281
THEE ARE FREE
TO DECLINE...

499
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,242
WITH NO HARM
ON THYSELF.

500

501
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,181
THEE SPEAKS?

THE CHOICE
HAS BEEN MADE, SPOCK.

505
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,565
IT IS UP TO HIM NOW.

506
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,067
HE DOES NOT...KNOW.

507
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,529
I WILL DO...

508
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,071
WHAT I MUST...

510
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,118
BUT NOT WITH HIM!

511
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,162
HIS BLOOD...

512
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,707
DOES NOT BURN.

513
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,750
HE IS MY FRIEND!

514
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,627
IT IS SAID...

515
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,755
THY VULCAN BLOOD IS THIN.

ARE THEE VULCAN...

517
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,259
OR ARE THEE HUMAN?

518
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:18,431
I BURN...T'PAU.

519
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,852

00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:31,194
THEE HAS THE POWER,
T'PAU.

522
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,698
IN THE NAME...
OF MY FATHERS,

523
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:39,118
FORBID.<i> FORBID!</i>

524
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,331
T'PAU...

525
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:47,168
I PLEAD...WITH THEE!

526
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,754
I BEG!

527
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:55,093
THEE HAS PRIDED THYSELF
ON THY VULCAN HERITAGE.

528
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,972
IT IS DECIDED.

529
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,956
WHAT HAPPENS TO SPOCK
IF I DECLINE?

530
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,666
ANOTHER CHAMPION
WILL BE SELECTED.

531
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,711
DO NOT INTERFERE, KIRK.

532
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,631
KEEP THY PLACE.

533
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,722
YOU CAN'T DO IT,
JIM.

534
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,974
I CAN'T?

535
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,183
NO. SHE SAID THEIR
LAWS AND CUSTOMS

536
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,227
WERE NOT BINDING
ON YOU.

537
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,813
AND YOU SAID SPOCK

538
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,856
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO HANDLE HIM.

539
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,400
IF I CAN
KNOCK SPOCK OUT WITHOUT
REALLY HURTING HIM...

540
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,860
IN THIS CLIMATE?

541
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:56,655
IF THE HEAT
DOESN'T GET YOU,
THE THIN AIR WILL.

542
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,093
YOU CAN'T DO IT!

543
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,846
IF I GET
INTO ANY TROUBLE,
I'LL QUIT,

544
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,598
AND SPOCK WINS,
AND HONOR IS SATISFIED.

545
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,266
JIM, LISTEN,
IF YOU--

546
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,101
BONES...

547
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,811
HE'S MY FIRST OFFICER,
MY FRIEND.

548
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,897
I DISREGARDED
STARFLEET ORDERS
TO BRING HIM HERE.

549
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,068
ANOTHER THING,
THAT'S...T'PAU...

550
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,362
A VULCAN...

551
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,364
ALL OF VULCAN
IN ONE PACKAGE.

552
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:43,035
HOW CAN I BACK OUT
IN FRONT OF HER?

553
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,500
IT IS DONE.

554
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,670
KIRK...DECIDE.

555
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,928
I ACCEPT...

556
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,638
THE CHALLENGE.

557
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,517
HERE BEGINS
THE ACT OF COMBAT

558
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:11,229
FOR POSSESSION
OF THE WOMAN T'PRING.

559
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,692
AS IT WAS AT THE TIME
OF THE BEGINNING,

560
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,319
SO IT IS NOW.

561
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,655
BRING FORTH THE<i> LIRPA.</i>

562
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,515
IF BOTH SURVIVE
THE<i> LIRPA...</i>

563
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,560
COMBAT WILL CONTINUE
WITH THE<i> AHN WOON.</i>

564
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:55,690
WHAT DO YOU MEAN...
"IF BOTH SURVIVE"?

565
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,610
THIS COMBAT IS
TO THE DEATH.

566
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,339
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE...
MA'AM.

567
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,634
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A FIGHT
TO THE DEATH?

568
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,428
THESE MEN ARE FRIENDS.
TO FORCE THEM TO FIGHT
TILL ONE OF THEM IS KILLED--

569
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,598
I CAN FORGIVE
SUCH A DISPLAY ONLY ONCE.

570
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,938
CHALLENGE WAS GIVEN...

571
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,440
AND LAWFULLY ACCEPTED.

572
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,485
IT HAS BEGUN.

573
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,114
LET NO ONE INTERFERE.

574
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,565
SPOCK! NO!

575
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,113
<i>KROYKAH!</i>

576
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,538
IS THIS VULCAN CHIVALRY?

577
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,874
THE AIR'S TOO HOT
AND THIN FOR KIRK.

578
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,084
HE'S NOT USED TO IT.

579
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,835
THE AIR IS THE AIR.

580
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,545
WHAT CAN BE DONE?

581
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,551
I CAN COMPENSATE

582
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,512
FOR THE ATMOSPHERE
AND THE TEMPERATURE
WITH THIS.

583
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,307
AT LEAST
IT WILL GIVE KIRK
A FIGHTING CHANCE.

584
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,559
THEE MAY PROCEED.

585
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:50,615
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO KILL HIM, JIM.

586
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,784
KILL SPOCK?

587
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:56,537
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE CAME
TO VULCAN FOR, IS IT?

588
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,205
WHAT'S THAT?

589
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,124
IT'S A TRIOX COMPOUND.

590
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:02,127
IT'LL HELP YOU BREATHE.

591
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,169
NOW BE CAREFUL!

592
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,797
SOUND MEDICAL ADVICE.

593
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,305
THE<i> AHN WOON.</i>

594
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,630
<i>KROYKAH!</i>

595
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,065
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF OF HIM, SPOCK!

596
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,196
IT'S FINISHED.

597
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,659
HE'S DEAD.

598
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,048
I GRIEVE WITH THEE.

599
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,304
McCOY TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

600
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,764
ENTERPRISE,
<i>LIEUTENANT UHURA HERE.</i>

601
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,391
HAVE
THE TRANSPORTER ROOM

602
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,602
STAND BY TO BEAM UP
THE LANDING PARTY.

603
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:38,699
AS STRANGE AS IT
MAY SEEM, MR. SPOCK,

604
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,660
YOU'RE IN COMMAND NOW.

605
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,288
ANY ORDERS?

606
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,584
YES.

607
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,669
I'LL FOLLOW YOU UP
IN A FEW MINUTES.

608
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,257
YOU WILL INSTRUCT
MR. CHEKOV

609
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,134
TO PLOT A COURSE...

610
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,803
FOR THE NEAREST
STARBASE...

611
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:02,974
WHERE I MUST
SURRENDER MYSELF
TO THE AUTHORITIES.

612
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:18,197
T'PRING...

613
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:19,198
EXPLAIN.

614
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,576
SPECIFY.

615
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,785
WHY THE CHALLENGE?

616
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,831
AND WHY YOU
CHOSE MY CAPTAIN
AS YOUR CHAMPION?

617
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,667
STONN WANTED ME.
I WANTED HIM.

618
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:38,759
I SEE NO LOGIC
IN PREFERRING STONN
OVER ME.

619
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,761
YOU HAVE BECOME
MUCH KNOWN

620
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,430
AMONG OUR PEOPLE,
SPOCK,

621
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,807
ALMOST A LEGEND.

622
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,476
AND AS THE YEARS
WENT BY,

623
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,436
I CAME TO KNOW
THAT I DID NOT WANT

624
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,397
TO BE THE CONSORT
OF A LEGEND...

625
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:52,773
BUT BY THE LAWS
OF OUR PEOPLE,

626
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,359
I COULD
ONLY DIVORCE YOU

627
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:55,527
BY THE<i> KAHLIFFEE.</i>

628
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:57,820
THERE WAS ALSO STONN
WHO WANTED VERY MUCH

629
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,364
TO BE MY CONSORT,

630
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:01,782
AND I WANTED HIM.

631
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,035
IF YOUR CAPTAIN
WERE VICTOR,

632
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,412
HE WOULD NOT WANT ME,
SO I WOULD HAVE STONN.

633
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,498
IF YOU WERE VICTOR,
YOU WOULD FREE ME

634
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,416
BECAUSE I HAD DARED
TO CHALLENGE

635
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:12,793
AND AGAIN
I WOULD HAVE STONN.

636
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,837
BUT IF YOU
DID NOT FREE ME,

637
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,839
IT WOULD BE THE SAME.

638
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,383
FOR YOU WOULD BE GONE,

639
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:19,842
AND I WOULD
HAVE YOUR NAME

640
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,469
AND YOUR PROPERTY,

641
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:25,848
AND STONN WOULD
STILL BE THERE.

642
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,850
LOGICAL...

643
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,061
FLAWLESSLY LOGICAL.

644
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,481
I AM HONORED.

645
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,149
STONN...

646
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,570
SHE IS YOURS.

647
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,114
AFTER A TIME...

648
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,783
YOU MAY FIND
THAT HAVING...

649
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,579
IS NOT SO PLEASING
A THING AFTER ALL

650
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:50,289
AS WANTING.

651
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:53,084
IT IS NOT LOGICAL,

652
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,294
BUT IT IS OFTEN TRUE.

653
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,048
SPOCK HERE.

654
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,842
STAND BY TO BEAM UP.

655
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,605
LIVE LONG, T'PAU,

656
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,732
AND PROSPER.

657
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:19,068
LIVE LONG
AND PROSPER, SPOCK.

658
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,531
I SHALL DO NEITHER.

659
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,782
I HAVE KILLED
MY CAPTAIN...

660
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,619
AND MY FRIEND.

661
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,298
ENERGIZE.

662
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:03,529
DOCTOR, I SHALL BE
RESIGNING MY COMMISSION
IMMEDIATELY, OF COURSE.

663
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:04,196
UH, SPOCK--

664
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,115
SO I WOULD APPRECIATE

665
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,743
YOUR MAKING
THE FINAL ARRANGEMENTS.

666
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,410
SPOCK, I--

667
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,621
DOCTOR, PLEASE,
LET ME FINISH.

668
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:14,415
THERE CAN BE NO EXCUSE
FOR THE CRIME
OF WHICH I'M GUILTY.

669
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,626
I INTEND TO OFFER
NO DEFENSE.

670
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,920
FURTHERMORE, I SHALL ORDER
MR. SCOTT TO TAKE IMMEDIATE
COMMAND OF THIS VESSEL.

671
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,838
DON'T YOU THINK YOU
BETTER CHECK
WITH ME FIRST?

672
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,048
CAPTAIN!

673
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,760
JIM!

674
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,977
I'M...PLEASED...

675
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,562
TO SEE YOU, CAPTAIN.

676
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:39,774
YOU SEEM...
UNINJURED.

677
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,359
I AM AT SOMETHING
OF A LOSS

678
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,735
TO UNDERSTAND IT,
HOWEVER.

679
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:43,986
BLAME McCOY.

680
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,405
THAT WAS NO TRIOX COMPOUND
HE SHOT ME WITH.

681
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:48,449
HE SLIPPED IN
A NEUROPARALYZER.

682
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,867
KNOCKED ME OUT,
SIMULATED DEATH.

683
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,787
INDEED.

684
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,039
NURSE, WOULD YOU MIND,
PLEASE?

685
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:05,341
SPOCK, WHAT HAPPENED
DOWN THERE? THE GIRL?
THE WEDDING?

686
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,676
AH, YES, THE GIRL.

687
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,302
HMM,
MOST INTERESTING.

688
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,137
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE COMBAT.

689
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,888
WHEN I THOUGHT I HAD
KILLED THE CAPTAIN,

690
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,141
I FOUND I'D LOST ALL
INTEREST IN T'PRING.

691
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,976
THE MADNESS WAS GONE.

692
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,855
[BOSUN'S WHISTLE]

693
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:19,605
KIRK HERE.

694
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,816
CAPTAIN KIRK, MESSAGE
FROM STARFLEET COMMAND,

695
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,693
TOP PRIORITY.

696
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,696
RELAY IT, LIEUTENANT.

697
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,322
RESPONSE

YOU CAN'T TELL ME

THAT YOU WEREN'T
ON THE VERGE OF GIVING US

THAT WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT THE HOUSE DOWN.

00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,522
MERELY MY QUITE LOGICAL
RELIEF THAT STARFLEET

714
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,775
HAD NOT LOST A HIGHLY
PROFICIENT CAPTAIN.

00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,818
YES, MR. SPOCK.
I UNDERSTAND.

716
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,445
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,446

00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,448

QUITE LOGICAL.

THE STORE.
