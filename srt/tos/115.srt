1
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,350
ANYTHING
FROM THE LANDING PARTY?

2
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,644
THEY SHOULD BE SENDING UP
A REPORT MOMENTARILY,
CAPTAIN.

3
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,646
OHH.

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:21,814
SOMETHING WRONG?

5
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,440
A KINK IN MY BACK.

6
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,192
THAT'S IT.

7
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,485
A LITTLE HIGHER,
PLEASE.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,362
PUSH. PUSH HARD.

9
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,572
DIG IT IN THERE,
MR. SP--

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,201
THANK YOU, YEOMAN.
THAT'S SUFFICIENT.

11
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,286
YOU NEED SLEEP,
CAPTAIN.

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,746
IF IT'S NOT
OUT OF LINE--

13
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,791
I HAVE ENOUGH OF THAT
FROM DR. McCOY, YEOMAN.
THANK YOU.

14
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,751
DR. McCOY IS CORRECT,
CAPTAIN.

15
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,753
AFTER WHAT THIS SHIP
HAS BEEN THROUGH
IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS,

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,297
THERE'S NOT A CREWMAN ABOARD
WHO'S NOT IN NEED OF A REST.

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,550
MYSELF EXCEPTED,
OF COURSE.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,559
HAVE DR. McCOY'S
REPORT

19
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,101
CHANNELED TO
MY QUARTERS,
LIEUTENANT.

20
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,270
AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.

21
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:20,831
BEAUTIFUL,

22
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:21,874
BEAUTIFUL.

23
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,667
NO ANIMALS.

24
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,877
NO PEOPLE.

25
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,169
NO WORRIES.

26
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,005
JUST WHAT
THE DOCTOR
ORDERED,

27
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,382
RIGHT, DOCTOR?

28
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,468
I COULDN'T HAVE
PRESCRIBED BETTER.

29
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,929
WE ARE
ONE WEARY SHIP.

30
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:38,057
YOU THINK THE CAPTAIN
WILL AUTHORIZE
A SHORE LEAVE HERE?

31
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,683
WELL,
DEPENDING UPON MY REPORT

32
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,977
AND THAT OF THE OTHER
SCOUTING PARTIES.

33
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:45,480
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
TO SEE THIS PLACE
TO BELIEVE IT.

34
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,150
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF
<i>ALICE IN WONDERLAND.</i>

35
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,986
THE CAPTAIN
HAS TO COME DOWN.

36
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,446
HE'D LIKE IT.

37
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,864
HE NEEDS IT.

38
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,033
YOU'VE GOT YOUR PROBLEMS.
I'VE GOT MINE.

39
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,453
BUT HE'S GOT OURS, PLUS HIS,
PLUS 430 OTHER PEOPLE.

40
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,165
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

41
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,459
TO GET SOME
CELL-STRUCTURE
RECORDS.

42
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:09,212
A BLADE OF GRASS,
A BUSH, A TREE,

43
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,798
A FLOWER PETAL.

44
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:15,469
WITH THESE, WE CAN
TELL THE WHOLE
PLANET BIOLOGY.

45
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:26,396
OH, MY PAWS
AND WHISKERS!

46
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,857
I'LL BE LATE.

47
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,658
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

48
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,577
HAVE YOU SEEN
A RATHER LARGE
WHITE RABBIT

49
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,247
WITH A YELLOW WAISTCOAT
AND WHITE GLOVES
HEREABOUT?

50
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,168
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

51
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,884
SULU!

52
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,392
WHAT IS IT?

53
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,020
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

54
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,063
DID YOU SEE THEM?

55
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,066
SEE WHAT?

56
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,987
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

57
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,907
WHAT IS IT, DOC?

58
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,880
SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

59
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,675
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,760
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--

61
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,680
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

62
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:45,392
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

63
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,563
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

64
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,599
Kirk:
CAPTAIN'S LOG.

65
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:29,978
STARDATE 3025...
UH, .3.

66
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,189
WE ARE ORBITING
AN UNINHABITED PLANET

67
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,191
IN THE OMICRON-DELTA
REGION,

68
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,193
A PLANET
REMARKABLY LIKE EARTH

69
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,278
OR HOW WE REMEMBER
EARTH TO BE--

70
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,240
PARKLIKE,
BEAUTIFUL, GREEN,

71
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,243
FLOWERS, TREES,
GREEN LAWN,

72
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,452
QUIET AND RESTFUL,

73
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,328
ALMOST TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE.

74
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,415
SIR, I DON'T SEE
YOUR NAME

75
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,375
IN ANY OF
THE SHORE PARTIES.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,294
WELL, I MAY BE TIRED,
YEOMAN,

77
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,755
BUT I'M NOT
FALLING APART.

78
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,173
DISMISSED.

79
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,758
AYE, AYE, SIR.

80
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,844
Man: SHORE-LEAVE PARTY ONE,
STAND BY YOUR SECTION.

81
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,888
YOU WILL BE CALLED
IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER.

82
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,225
MR. SPOCK, WE'RE BEAMING DOWN
THE STARBOARD SECTION FIRST.

83
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,228
WHICH SECTION WOULD YOU
LIKE TO GO WITH?

84
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,647
NOT NECESSARY
IN MY CASE, CAPTAIN.

85
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,190
ON MY PLANET,

86
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,192
"TO REST"
IS TO REST,

87
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,277
TO CEASE
USING ENERGY.

88
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,155
TO ME, IT IS
QUITE ILLOGICAL

89
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,199
TO RUN UP AND DOWN
ON GREEN GRASS
USING ENERGY

90
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,575
INSTEAD
OF SAVING IT.

91
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,244
[INTERCOM
WHISTLES]

92
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,620
KIRK HERE.

93
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,998
Uhura: DR. McCOY CALLING
FROM THE PLANET, CAPTAIN.

94
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,415
YES.
OPEN A CHANNEL, UHURA.

95
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,542
AYE, AYE, SIR.

96
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,335
CAPTAIN,
ARE YOU BEAMING DOWN?

97
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,255
I HADN'T PLANNED TO,
BONES. WHY?

98
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:43,260
WELL, EITHER
OUR SCOUTING PROBES
AND DETECTORS

99
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,845
ARE MALFUNCTIONING

100
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,224
AND ALL US SCOUTS CARELESS
AND BEAUTY-INTOXICATED,

101
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:53,020
OR I MUST REPORT MYSELF
UNFIT FOR DUTY.

102
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,605
EXPLAIN.

103
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,194
ON THIS SUPPOSEDLY
UNINHABITED PLANET,

104
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,530
I JUST SAW
A LARGE RABBIT

105
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,282
PULL A GOLD WATCH
FROM HIS VEST

106
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,159
AND CLAIM
THAT HE WAS LATE.

107
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,244
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD BONES.
ALL RIGHT,
I GOT ONE FOR YOU.

108
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,747
THE RABBIT WAS FOLLOWED
BY A LITTLE BLOND GIRL,
RIGHT?

109
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,833
AS A MATTER
OF FACT, YES,

110
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,837
AND THEY DISAPPEARED
THROUGH A HOLE
IN A HEDGE.

111
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,379
ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR,

112
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:24,259
I'LL TAKE YOUR REPORT
UNDER CONSIDERATION.

113
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,426
CAPTAIN OUT.

114
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,221
THAT'S A McCOY PILL

115
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,848
WITH A LITTLE MYSTERY
SUGARCOATING.

116
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,059
HE WANTS TO GET ME
DOWN THERE.

117
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,269
AFRAID I WON'T
SWALLOW IT.

118
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,854
VERY WELL, CAPTAIN.

119
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,190
SOMETHING I DID
COME TO DISCUSS.

120
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,567
YES, MR. SPOCK,
WHAT IS IT?

121
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,278
I PICKED THIS UP
FROM DR. McCOY'S LOG.

122
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,613
WE HAVE
A CREW MEMBER ABOARD

123
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,200
WHO'S SHOWING SIGNS
OF STRESS AND FATIGUE--

124
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,202
REACTION TIME
DOWN 9-12%,

125
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,329
ASSOCIATIONAL READING
NORM MINUS 3.

126
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,872
THAT'S MUCH TOO LOW
A RATING.

127
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,957
HE'S BECOMING IRRITABLE
AND QUARRELSOME,

128
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,668
YET HE REFUSES TO TAKE
REST AND REHABILITATION.

129
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,795
HE HAS THAT RIGHT,
BUT WE'VE FOUND--

130
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,590
A CREWMAN'S RIGHT ENDS
WHERE THE SAFETY
OF THE SHIP BEGINS.

131
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,301
NOW, THAT MAN WILL GO
ASHORE ON MY ORDERS.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

132
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,762
"JAMES KIRK."

133
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,224
ENJOY YOURSELF, CAPTAIN.

134
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,808
IT'S AN INTERESTING PLANET.

135
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,269
I BELIEVE YOU'LL FIND IT
QUITE PLEASANT,

136
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,645
VERY MUCH LIKE
YOUR EARTH.

137
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,274
SCOUTS HAVE DETECTED
NO ANIMALS, ARTIFACTS,

138
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,193
OR FORCE FIELDS
OF ANY KIND,

139
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,155
ONLY PEACE, SUNSHINE,
AND GOOD AIR.

140
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,657
YOU'LL HAVE NO PROBLEMS.

141
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,255
ALWAYS HAVE TO
BE WORK WITH YOU?

142
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,132
SO MUCH LOVELINESS.

143
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,301
YOU WON'T FIND
ALL THIS SO LOVELY

144
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,137
IF OUR REPORT
FOR THE CAPTAIN

145
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,638
ISN'T READY
WHEN HE ASKS FOR IT.

146
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,181
OHH.

147
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,100
WHICH SHOULDN'T
BE LONG.

148
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,702
RODRIGUEZ, TELLER,
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

149
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,414
YES, SIR.
WE'VE COMPLETED
THE SPECIMEN SURVEY.

150
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,623
GOOD. THAT SHOULD BE
SUFFICIENT.

151
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,625
BEAM IT UP TO MR. SPOCK
WHEN YOU'RE READY,

152
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,793
AND START
ENJOYING YOURSELVES.

153
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,920
THANK YOU, SIR.
AND SIR,

154
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,048
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
DR. McCOY AND
MR. SULU THAT WAY.

155
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,050
THANK YOU.

156
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,637
RESTFUL.

157
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,097
AFTER WHAT
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

158
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,390
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

159
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,558
A PLACE
THIS BEAUTIFUL EXISTS.

160
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,185
IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

161
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,605
SO LOVELY,
AND RESTFUL.

162
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,192
I MEAN, AFFIRMATIVE,
CAPTAIN.

163
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,363
McCOY!

164
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,571
[ECHOS]
McCOY!

165
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,739
OVER HERE.

166
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,533
[ECHOS]
OVER HERE.

167
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,464
BONES, KNOW ANY GOOD
RABBIT JOKES LATELY?

168
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,424
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DO,

169
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,926
BUT THIS IS NOT
ONE OF THEM.
LOOK AT THIS.

170
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,971
I SAW WHAT I SAW,

171
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,182
OR MAYBE
I HALLUCINATED IT.

172
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,599
BUT I WANT YOU
TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT

173
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,809
AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

174
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,853
FOOTPRINTS.

175
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,903
COULD BE A RABBIT.

176
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:34,533
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
AN UNUSUAL CREATURE

177
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,576
TO MAKE
THIS SIZE TRACKS.

178
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,583
WHAT ABOUT MR. SULU?
WILL HE CONFIRM
WHAT YOU SAW?

183
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,008
COLLECTING SPECIMENS.

184
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,134
Uhura:

185
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,802
HAS THE FIRST SHORE PARTY
BEAMED DOWN YET?

186
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,763
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.
THEY'RE JUST
ABOUT TO START.

187
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,515

188
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,393
STAND BY. NO ONE
IS TO LEAVE THE SHIP.

00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,311
AYE, AYE, SIR.

190
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,812
YOU MEAN
YOU'RE CANCELING
THE SHORE LEAVE

191

192
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,316
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR,

EXPLAIN THIS?

193
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,776
WELL, NO, BUT...

194
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,319
NEITHER CAN I.

195
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,113
I ADMIT
IT LOOKS HARMLESS.

196
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,739
PROBABLY
IS HARMLESS,

197
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,409
BUT BEFORE I BRING
MY PEOPLE DOWN HERE,

198
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,868
I WANT PROOF
IT'S HARMLESS.

YOU'RE DOING?

TARGET SHOOTING, CAPTAIN.
ISN'T IT A BEAUTY?

204
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,318
I HAVEN'T GOT
ANYTHING LIKE THIS
IN MY COLLECTION.

205
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,403
WHERE DID YOU GET IT,
MR. SULU?

206
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,946
I FOUND IT.

207
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,531
I KNOW IT'S
A CRAZY COINCIDENCE,

208
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,366
BUT I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED ONE
LIKE THIS.

209
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,452
FOUND IT LYING
RIGHT OVER THERE--

210
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,079
AN OLD-TIME
POLICE SPECIAL,

211
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,415
AND IN BEAUTIFUL
CONDITION.

212
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,874
HASN'T BEEN ONE
LIKE THIS MADE

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,837
IN, OH,
A COUPLE CENTURIES.

00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,590
MR. SULU.

215
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,675
IT FIRES
LEAD PELLETS

216
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,052
PROPELLED BY
EXPANDING GASES

217
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,097
FROM A CHEMICAL
EXPLOSION.

218
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,351
I'LL HANG ON TO IT.

219
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,186
THE FRESH AIR SEEMS
TO HAVE MADE YOU
TRIGGER HAPPY.

220
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,396
DR. McCOY'S RABBIT, SIR,

221
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,607
HE MUST HAVE GONE
THROUGH HERE.

222
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,028
ARE YOU SURE
OUR INSTRUMENTS

223
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,947
DIDN'T SHOW
ANY ANIMAL LIFE
ON THIS PLANET?

224
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,324
ABSOLUTELY.

225
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,576
NO BIRDS, NO MAMMALS,
NO INSECTS--NOTHING.

226
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,786
I'M CERTAIN OUR READINGS
WEREN'T OFF.

227
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,748
I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE THIS
IS AN ELABORATE GAG, BUT...

228
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,335
YEOMAN BARROWS,
YOU ACCOMPANY MR. SULU.

229
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,753

THOSE TRACKS CAME FROM.

230
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,881
DOCTOR,
YOU COME WITH ME
BACK TO THE GLADE.

231
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,259
I'D LIKE TO TAKE
ANOTHER LOOK
AT THAT AREA.

232
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,662
THIS IS TURNING OUT TO BE
ONE VERY UNUSUAL
SHORE LEAVE.

233
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,871
WELL, IT COULD HAVE
BEEN WORSE.

234
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,248
HOW?

235
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,709
YOU COULD HAVE
SEEN THE RABBIT.

236
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,544
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BONES? YOU GETTING
A PERSECUTION COMPLEX?

237
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,128
WELL, YEAH,
I'M BEGINNING
TO FEEL

238
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,838
A LITTLE BIT
PICKED ON, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU MEAN.

239
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,048
WELL,
I KNOW THE FEELING
VERY WELL.

240
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,092
I HAD IT
AT THE ACADEMY.

241
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,345
AN UPPERCLASSMAN THERE--

242
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,681
ONE PRACTICAL JOKE
AFTER ANOTHER

243
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,849
AND ALWAYS ON ME--
MY OWN PERSONAL DEVIL,

244
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,518
A GUY BY THE NAME
OF FINNEGAN.

245
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,562
AND YOU BEING
THE VERY SERIOUS YOUNG--

246
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,106
SERIOUS?
I'LL MAKE A CONFESSION,
BONES.

247
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,483
I WAS ABSOLUTELY GRIM,
WHICH DELIGHTED
FINNEGAN NO END.

248
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,069
HE'S THE KIND OF GUY
TO PUT A BOWL OF COLD SOUP
IN YOUR BED

249
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,030
OR A BUCKET OF WATER
PROPPED ON A HALF-OPEN DOOR.

250
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,950
YOU NEVER KNEW
WHERE HE'D STRIKE NEXT.

251
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,703
MORE TRACKS.

252
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,957
LOOKS LIKE YOUR RABBIT
CAME FROM OVER THERE.

253
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,460
A GIRL'S FOOTPRINTS.

254
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,253
THE YOUNG BLOND GIRL
I SAW CHASING HIM.

255
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,297
YES.

256
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,507
YOU FOLLOW THE RABBIT.

257
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,344
I'LL BACKTRACK THE GIRL.

258
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,764

THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE HILL.

AGAINST THAT RABBIT, JIM.

I'M GOING TO STRIKE,

I LIKE THEM FINE,

BUT ALL OUR SURVEYS
SHOWED--

358
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:57,071

I'D SAY OUR INSTRUMENTS
ARE DEFECTIVE.

ON THIS PLANET.

00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,267
THESE EXPERIENCES WERE
INTENDED TO AMUSE YOU.

705
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,436
AMUSE?

706
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,896
THAT'S YOUR WORD
FOR WHAT WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH?

707
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,232
BUT NONE OF THIS
IS PERMANENT.

708
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:56,027
HERE, YOU HAVE TO ONLY
IMAGINE YOUR FONDEST WISHES,

709
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,029
EITHER OLD ONES
WHICH YOU WISH TO RELIVE,

710
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,322
OR NEW ONES,
ANYTHING AT ALL--

711
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,783
BATTLE, FEAR,
LOVE, TRIUMPH...

712
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:06,245
ANYTHING THAT PLEASES YOU
CAN BE MADE TO HAPPEN.

713
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,164
THE TERM IS
AMUSEMENT PARK.

714
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,499
OF COURSE.

715
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,750
AN OLD EARTH NAME
FOR A PLACE WHERE
PEOPLE COULD GO

716
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:15,880
TO SEE AND DO
ALL SORTS OF
FASCINATING THINGS.

717
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:19,217
THIS ENTIRE PLANET
WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR
OUR RACE OF PEOPLE

718
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,553
TO COME...
AND PLAY.

719
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:22,928
PLAY?

720
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:26,224
AS ADVANCED
AS YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE,

721
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,184
AND YOU STILL PLAY?

722
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,227
YES, PLAY, MR. SULU.

723
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,728
THE MORE COMPLEX
THE MIND,

724
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,524
THE GREATER THE NEED
FOR THE SIMPLICITY
OF PLAY.

725
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,984
EXACTLY, CAPTAIN.
HOW PERCEPTIVE OF YOU.

726
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:41,155
THAT STILL DOESN'T
EXPLAIN THE DEATH
OF MY SHIP'S SURGEON.

727
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,033
POSSIBLY
BECAUSE NO ONE
HAS DIED, JIM.

728
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,330
I WAS TAKEN
BELOW THE SURFACE

729
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,207
FOR SOME RATHER
REMARKABLE REPAIRS.

730
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,749
IT'S AMAZING.

731
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,085
THEY'VE GOT
A FACTORY COMPLEX
DOWN THERE

732
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,545
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

733
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,589
THEY CAN BUILD
OR DO ANYTHING
IMMEDIATELY.

734
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,224
AND, UH, HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN THEM?

735
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,643
OH. THEM. WELL...

736
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:11,852
I, UH...

737
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:16,815
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT A LITTLE CABARET
I KNOW ON RIGEL 2,

738
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:20,570
AND, UH, THERE WERE
THESE 2 GIRLS
IN A CHORUS LINE...

739
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,907
AND, WELL,
HERE THEY ARE.

740
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:30,246
WELL, AFTER ALL,
I AM ON SHORE LEAVE.

741
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,539
AND SO AM I.

742
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,416
YES. SO YOU ARE.

743
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,002
WELL, GIRLS, I SUPPOSE
YOU CAN TURN SOMETHING UP.

744
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,636
WE REGRET THAT
SOME OF YOU'VE BEEN
MADE UNCOMFORTABLE.

745
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:47,513
YOU SAY YOUR PEOPLE
BUILT ALL THIS.

746
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:50,391
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT PLANET
ARE YOU FROM?

747
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,936
MY IMPRESSION IS
THAT YOUR RACE

748
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,523
IS NOT YET READY
TO UNDERSTAND US,
CAPTAIN.

749
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:59,525
I TEND TO AGREE.

750
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:01,444
[COMMUNICATOR BEEPS]

751
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,155
KIRK HERE.

752
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,531
Uhura:
THIS IS THE BRIDGE,
CAPTAIN.

753
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,784
OUR POWER SYSTEMS
HAVE JUST COME BACK IN.

754
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,577
DO YOU REQUIRE
ASSISTANCE?

755
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,036
NO, EVERYTHING
IS IN ORDER,
LIEUTENANT.

756
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:11,996
STAND BY.

757
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,414
HOWEVER...
AYE AYE, SIR.

758
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,792
IF YOU WOULD USE
THE PROPER CAUTION,

759
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,835
THIS AMUSEMENT
PLANET OF OURS COULD
BE AN IDEAL PLACE

760
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,838
FOR YOUR PEOPLE TO
ENJOY THEMSELVES...

761
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,341
IF YOU WISH.

762
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:25,635
IT'S WHAT
THE DOCTOR ORDERED, JIM.

763
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,430
LIEUTENANT...

764
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,847
SIR?

765
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:34,059
COMMENCE TRANSPORTING
SHORE LEAVE PARTIES.

766
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,520
TELL THEM TO PREPARE

767
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:38,648
FOR THE BEST SHORE LEAVE
THEY'VE EVER HAD.
KIRK OUT.

768
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:42,193
CAPTAIN, I'LL GO
BACK ABOARD SHIP
AND TAKE OVER.

769
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,779
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
TO THE YOUNG LADY,

770
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:50,075
I'VE ALREADY HAD
AS MUCH SHORE LEAVE
AS I CARE FOR.

771
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:53,788
NO, MR. SPOCK.
I'LL GO. YOU--

772
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,345
ON THE OTHER HAND...

773
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:13,890
I'LL STAY
FOR A DAY OR TWO.

774
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:44,380
DID YOU ENJOY YOUR REST,
GENTLEMEN?

775
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:47,717
YES, WE...DID, MR. SPOCK.

776
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,301
I THINK WE DID.

777
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,637
INDEED WE DID,
MR. SPOCK.

778
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,768
MOST ILLOGICAL.

779
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,530
AHEAD WARP FACTOR ONE,
MR. SULU.
