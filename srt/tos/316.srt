1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,548
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 5423.4.

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,050
WE ARE ORBITING
THE PLANET GIDEON,

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,929
WHICH IS STILL NOT A MEMBER
OF THE UNITED FEDERATION
OF PLANETS.

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,931
THE TREATY NEGOTIATIONS
HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,892
BECAUSE GIDEON HAS CONSISTENTLY
REFUSED THE PRESENCE

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,854
OF A DELEGATION
FROM THE FEDERATION
ON ITS SOIL

7
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,690
OR ANY SURVEILLANCE
BY THE SHIP'S SENSORS.

8
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,817
THEY HAVE FINALLY AGREED
TO A DELEGATION OF ONE.

9
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,904
THEY INSISTED IT BE THE CAPTAIN
OF THE "ENTERPRISE."

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,282
I AM THEREFORE
BEAMING DOWN AT ONCE.

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,575
IT'S TOO BAD
GIDEON ISN'T CLEARED

12
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:34,994
FOR GENERAL
VISITATION,
MR. SPOCK.

13
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,329
ACCORDING TO
THE PHYSIO-CULTURAL
REPORTS SUBMITTED

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,247
TO THE FEDERATION,
IT'S A VIRTUAL PARADISE.

15
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,667
I SHALL BE INTERESTED
IN HEARING YOUR
DESCRIPTION, CAPTAIN.

16
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,419
YOU WON'T HAVE
LONG TO WAIT.

17
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,420
LIEUTENANT UHURA.

18
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,714
YES, MR. SPOCK.

19
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,089
DO WE HAVE
FINAL CLEARANCE
FROM GIDEON?

20
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,091
YES, MR. SPOCK.

21
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,927
THEY HAVE PROVIDED US
WITH THE COORDINATES
FOR BEAM-DOWN.

22
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,846
MAY I HAVE THEM,
PLEASE?

23
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,222
875.

24
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,557
875.

25
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,433
020.

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,561
020.

27
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,729
079.

28
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,190
079.

29
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,692
LET'S GO,
MR. SPOCK.

30
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,236
ENERGIZING.

31
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,759
MR. SPOCK?

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,057
MR. SPOCK, I HAVE NOT
YET TRANSPORTED DOWN.

33
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,768
WHY DID YOU LEAVE YOUR POST
BEFORE CONFIRMING TRANSPORT?

34
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,562
MR. SPOCK?

35
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,607
SPOCK?

36
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,843
ENGINEERING.

37
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,971
MR. SCOTT?

38
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,430
SCOTTY?

39
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,812
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
REPORT IMMEDIATELY.

40
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,440
ALL BRIDGE PERSONNEL,
REPORT IMMEDIATELY.

41
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,944
KIRK TO CREW.

42
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,737
IS ANYONE ABOARD?

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,534
SICK BAY. DR. McCOY.

44
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,495
BONES?

45
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,497
BONES, ANSWER ME.

46
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,875
BONES.

47
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,522
STILL ORBITING GIDEON.

48
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,504
Kirk: SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

49
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,681
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES OF
THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

50
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,560
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--
TO EXPLORE STRANGE NEW WORLDS,

51
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:50,605
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,

52
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,359
TO BOLDLY GO
WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

53
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,666
Kirk, voice-over: I AM ALONE
ON THE "ENTERPRISE."

54
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,585
I HAVE SEARCHED
EVERY AREA OF THE SHIP

55
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,713
AND STILL CANNOT FIND
A TRACE OF THE CREW

56
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,716
OR AN INDICATION OF HOW
ITS DISAPPEARANCE WAS MANAGED.

57
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,510
THE ONE THING
THAT IS OBVIOUS

58
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,511
IS THAT I SUFFERED
A MEMORY LAPSE

59
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,723
DURING WHICH TIME
I BRUISED MY ARM.

60
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,517
IT IS CAUSING ME
SOME IRRITATION.

61
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,771
GIDEON IS CONTACTING
US, MR. SPOCK.

62
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,856
PUT IT ON THE SCREEN.

63
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,399
AYE, SIR.

64
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:21,488
CAPTAIN KIRK?
THIS IS AMBASSADOR HODIN.

65
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,658
THE COUNCIL IS STILL
AWAITING YOUR ARRIVAL.

66
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,535
THIS IS MR. SPOCK,
AMBASSADOR HODIN.

67
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,455
CAPTAIN KIRK WAS
TRANSPORTED DOWN
MINUTES AGO.

68
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,332
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

69
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,084
I TRANSPORTED
HIM MYSELF.

70
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,461
HE NEVER ARRIVED.

71
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,507
HE WAS BEAMED DIRECTLY
TO YOUR COUNCIL CHAMBERS.

72
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,717
PLEASE VERIFY
YOUR COORDINATES.

73
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,681
875...

74
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,891
020...

75
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,893
079.

76
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,895
COORDINATES
CONFIRMED.

77
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,231
WE GAVE YOU
THE EXACT COORDINATES

78
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,860
WHICH SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT
CAPTAIN KIRK DIRECTLY
INTO THIS VERY ROOM.

79
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,196
I AM NOT QUESTIONING
THAT, SIR.

80
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,864
IF HE'S NOT HERE,

81
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,326
THAT IS YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY,
MR. SPOCK

82
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,910
AND THAT OF YOUR STAFF.

83
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,745
I DO NOT DENY
THAT, SIR.

84
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,207
I AM NOT ATTEMPTING
TO BLAME YOUR PERSONNEL.

85
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,500
WE ARE GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.

86
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,503
WE SHALL HAVE TO ENTER IT
INTO THE RECORDS

87
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,463
OF THIS MOST
UNFORTUNATE EVENT.

88
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,884
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
EVEN WITH INTRICATE
MACHINERY

89
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,053
AS DELICATELY
BALANCED AS OURS,

90
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,637
THERE IS STILL
A MARGIN FOR ERROR

91
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,680
WHICH MUST
BE DEALT WITH.

92
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,599
IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT CAPTAIN KIRK
MATERIALIZED

93
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,727
ON SOME OTHER PART
OF GIDEON.

94
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,063
LET US HOPE IT WAS
ON DRY LAND.

95
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,981
YOUR EXCELLENCY--

96
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,152
MAY I CUT RIGHT
TO THE HEART
OF THE MATTER?

97
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,862
I REQUEST PERMISSION
TO BEAM DOWN

98
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,739
TO CONDUCT
THE SEARCH
FOR OUR CAPTAIN.

99
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,199
PERMISSION DENIED.

100
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,577
YOUR FEDERATION
MUST BE AWARE

101
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:55,165
OF OUR JEALOUS TRADITION
OF ISOLATION FROM ALL
CONTAMINATING CONTACTS

102
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,875
WITH THE VIOLENT NATURE

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,418
OF PLANETS
OF OTHER STAR SYSTEMS.

104
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,546
YOUR EXCELLENCY,

105
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,882
THE WARS
BETWEEN OPPOSING
STAR SYSTEMS

106
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,134
NO LONGER PREVAIL
IN OUR GALAXY.

107
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,802
IF YOU WILL GRANT
PERMISSION--

108
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,264
OF COURSE, WE SHALL INSTITUTE
A THOROUGH SEARCH.

109
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,266
IN THE MEANTIME,
MR. SPOCK,

110
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,935
I SUGGEST THAT YOU LOOK
TO YOUR MACHINERY.

111
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,440
WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE
ONCE AND FOR ALL

112
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:25,028
THAT THE PURPOSE
OF DIPLOMACY IS
TO PROLONG A CRISIS.

113
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,448
McCoy: WHAT ARE WE WAITING
FOR, MR. SPOCK?
WE'RE NOT DIPLOMATS!

114
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,368
WE ARE REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE FEDERATION,
DOCTOR.

115
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,870
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WE HAVE TO BEHAVE
LIKE CHILDREN

116
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,748
AND LISTEN
TO SOME FOOL LECTURE
BY A DIPLOMAT.

117
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,875
UNFORTUNATELY, DIPLOMACY
IS THE ONLY CHANNEL

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,752
AVAILABLE TO US
AT THE MOMENT.

119
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,503
THE PLANET IS SHIELDED
FROM OUR SENSORS.

120
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,505
THEREFORE,
WE CANNOT SCAN IT.

121
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,383
THEREFORE WE ARE UNABLE
TO SELECT COORDINATES.

122
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,843
THEY MUST BE PROVIDED
BY GIDEON.

123
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,679
WE SHOULD NEVER
HAVE AGREED TO
SUCH RESTRICTIONS.

124
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,307
Spock: WE DID NOT,
MR. CHEKOV.

125
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,682
THE FEDERATION DID.

126
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,101
LIEUTENANT UHURA.

127
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,518
YES, MR. SPOCK.

128
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,937
CONTACT STARFLEET
IMMEDIATELY.

129
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,521
EXPLAIN OUR PROBLEM.

130
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,523
REQUEST PERMISSION TO USE
EVERY MEANS AT OUR DISPOSAL

131
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,901
TO PRESS THE SEARCH
FOR CAPTAIN KIRK.

132
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,445
AT ONCE, SIR.

133
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,822
Chekov:
ARE THERE ANY OTHER
POSSIBILITIES?

134
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,908
THERE ARE ENDLESS,
MR. CHEKOV.

135
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,534
McCoy: WHERE DO WE
START, MR. SPOCK?

136
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,497
INSTITUTE
A SENSOR SCAN
360 DEGREES,

137
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,624
ONE DEGREE
AT A TIME.

138
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,295
YOU MEAN YOU'RE GOING
TO SCAN SPACE FOR HIM?

139
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,545
BUT, SIR, THAT COULD
TAKE YEARS.

140
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,882
THEN THE SOONER
YOU BEGIN,
THE BETTER.

141
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,509
AYE, SIR.

142
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,310
[DOOR OPENS]

143
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,832
WHO ARE YOU?

144
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,212
ODONA.

145
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,173
YES. MY NAME
IS ODONA.

146
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,385
WHY DID YOU
BRING ME HERE?

147
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,388
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ON MY SHIP?

148
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,226
IS THIS ENTIRE SHIP
YOURS?

149
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,144
NOT MY PERSONAL
PROPERTY,

150
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,812
BUT I'M THE CAPTAIN.

151
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,190
OH! AND YOU HAVE IT
ALL TO YOURSELF?

152
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,400
IT SEEMS,
AT THE MOMENT,

153
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,443
WE HAVE IT ALL
TO OURSELVES.

154
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,610
OH!

155
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,073
YOU'RE HURTING ME,
CAPTAIN--

156
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,615
KIRK. I'M SORRY.

157
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,783
JAMES KIRK.

158
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,744
AND I DIDN'T
BRING YOU HERE.

159
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:38,578
IF YOU DIDN'T
BRING ME HERE--

160
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,498
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHO HAS BROUGHT
YOU HERE?

161
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,418
I DON'T KNOW.

162
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,336
YOU...

163
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,592
WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE
YOU CAME HERE?

164
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,929
TRY TO REMEMBER.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

165
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:03,019
IT SEEMS I WAS
STANDING IN A--

166
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,813
YES, I WAS STANDING
IN A LARGE AUDITORIUM

167
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,357
CROWDED WITH PEOPLE--

168
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,026
THOUSANDS PRESSED
IN AGAINST ME.

169
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,278
I COULD HARDLY
BREATHE.

170
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,738
I WAS FIGHTING
FOR OXYGEN,

171
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,366
SCREAMING
TO GET OUT.

172
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,952
DON'T BE AFRAID.

173
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,414
I'M NOT.

174
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,623
BUT YOU ARE TROUBLED.

175
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,419
I SEEM TO BE
THE ONLY ONE
OF MY CREW

176
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,753
LEFT ON BOARD
THE "ENTERPRISE."

177
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,465
430,

178
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:36,052
AND I APPARENTLY AM
THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

179
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,556
I'M SORRY.
I WISH I COULD HELP.

180
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,349
MAYBE YOU CAN.

181
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,392
TELL ME THE REST.

182
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,395
YOU WERE FIGHTING
FOR OXYGEN,

183
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,439
SCREAMING TO GET
OUT OF THERE.

184
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,775
AND THEN SUDDENLY
I WAS HERE ON THIS--

185
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,319
ON YOUR SHIP,

186
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,155
AND THERE WAS
ALL THIS SPACE
AND FREEDOM.

187
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,616
I JUST WANTED
TO FLOAT.

188
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,996
AND THEN,
THERE YOU WERE.

189
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,872
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
ABOARD THE "ENTERPRISE"?

190
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,874
I DON'T KNOW.

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,543
NOT LONG.

192
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,421
IS IT IMPORTANT?

193
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,798
IT MIGHT BE.
COME WITH ME.

194
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,051
LIEUTENANT UHURA,

195
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,720
HAS STARFLEET
HONORED OUR REQUEST
WITH A REPLY?

196
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,223
THERE'S BEEN
NO RESPONSE
AS YET, SIR.

197
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,101
DID YOU ADVISE THEM
THAT THE CAPTAIN'S
LIFE IS AT STAKE?

198
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,812
YES, SIR. THEY INSIST
THE MATTER MUST BE REFERRED

199
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,439
TO THE FEDERATION.

200
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,773
WHAT DEPARTMENT?

201
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,275
THE BUREAU
OF PLANETARY TREATIES.

202
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,109
CONTACT THEM DIRECTLY.

203
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,028
I DID, MR. SPOCK.

204
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,572
THEY INSIST THAT
WE MUST GO THROUGH
STARFLEET CHANNELS.

205
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,912
WITH THE CAPTAIN
LOST SOMEWHERE,

206
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,290
THAT'S THE BEST
THEY COULD COME UP WITH?

207
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,667
DIPLOMATS
AND BUREAUCRATS

208
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,877
MAY FUNCTION
DIFFERENTLY,

209
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,297
BUT THEY ACHIEVE EXACTLY
THE SAME RESULTS.

210
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:05,350
NINE MINUTES OF MY LIFE
HAS BEEN LOST.

211
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,018
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

212
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,145
BETWEEN THE TIME I TRIED
TO BEAM DOWN TO GIDEON

213
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,231
AND I FOUND
MYSELF HERE ALONE,

214
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,024
9 MINUTES HAVE DISAPPEARED,
JUST LIKE THAT.

215
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,403
NOW, WHAT HAPPENED
DURING THOSE 9 MINUTES?

216
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,612
WHAT IS GIDEON?

217
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,449
THAT'S YOUR HOME.

218
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,784
THE PLANET
THAT YOU COME FROM.

219
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,827
IS IT?

220
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,538
WELL, IT MUST BE.

221
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,792
GIDEON? I DON'T KNOW
ANY GIDEON.

222
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,836
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

223
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,381
WE WERE IN
SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT

224
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,549
OVER THE CAPITAL CITY
OF GIDEON.

225
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,509
I TRIED TO BEAM DOWN.
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

226
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,761
AND YOU WERE BEAMED
ABOARD FROM GIDEON.

227
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,641
OH, I DO NOT
THINK SO.

228
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,612
WE'RE NO LONGER
OVER GIDEON.

229
00:12:58,737 --> 00:12:59,738
WHERE ARE WE?

230
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,575
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT FAMILIAR
WITH THAT QUADRANT.

231
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:12,375
ODONA, YOU MUST REALIZE
THAT WE'RE NOT
HERE BY ACCIDENT.

232
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,172
SOME FORCE,
SOME INTELLIGENCE
HAS ARRANGED THIS--

233
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,840
FOR A PURPOSE.

234
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,051
CAPTAIN.

235
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,221
BEFORE, I SAID
I WASN'T AFRAID.

236
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,098
NOW I AM.

237
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,614
THE AMBASSADOR
WILL SPEAK, SIR.

238
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,408
THEY'RE REQUESTING
VISUAL COMMUNICATION.

239
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,702
GOOD NEWS. VERY GOOD NEWS
INDEED, MR. SPOCK.

240
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,746
YOUR CAPTAIN IS
DEFINITELY NOT ON GIDEON.

241
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,873
AS YOU REQUESTED, WE MADE
A MOST THOROUGH SEARCH,

242
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,084
AND YOU WILL BE
RELIEVED TO KNOW

243
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,128
THAT YOU MAY NOW INVESTIGATE
ALL THE OTHER POSSIBILITIES

244
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,046
AND FORGET ABOUT GIDEON.

245
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,258
BUT THAT IS NOT
WHAT WE REQUESTED.

246
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,135
YOU REQUESTED
A MOST THOROUGH SEARCH.

247
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,720
IT IS IN THE RECORD,

248
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,847
AND WE HAVE USED
EVERY MEANS AT OUR DISPOSAL

249
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,684
TO ACCOMMODATE YOU.

250
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,393
YOUR RECORD
ON THE SUBJECT

251
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,564
IS NOT PRECISE,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.

252
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,614
SURELY, MR. SPOCK,
YOU DO NOT INTEND,
I HOPE, TO CREATE

253
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,949
A DISPUTE BETWEEN
THE FEDERATION
AND GIDEON.

254
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,868
YOUR EXCELLENCY,

255
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,496
A DISPUTE IS
THE FARTHEST THING
FROM OUR MINDS,

256
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,290
AND THERE'S NO NEED
TO CHECK YOUR RECORDS.

257
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:38,002
I MERELY SUGGEST
THAT THE LANGUAGE
OF OUR STATEMENT

258
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,922
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
UNDERSTOOD

259
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,717
EXACTLY AS INTENDED.

260
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,636
MR. SPOCK, YOU ARE
AN OFFICER OF A SPACESHIP.

261
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,222
IN YOUR PROFESSION,
YOU USE MANY INSTRUMENTS,
TOOLS, AND WEAPONS

262
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,140
TO ACHIEVE
YOUR OBJECTIVES.

263
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,767
TRUE,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.

264
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:57,522
HOWEVER, THE ONLY TOOL
DIPLOMACY HAS IS LANGUAGE.

265
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,649
IT IS
OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE

266
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,984
THAT THE MEANING BE
CRYSTAL CLEAR.

267
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,030
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
I AM BASICALLY
A SCIENTIST.

268
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,074
CLARITY OF FORMULATION
IS ESSENTIAL

269
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,076
IN MY PROFESSION ALSO.

270
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,119
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

271
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,748
PERHAPS YOU COULD THEN
MAKE GREATER EFFORT

272
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,585
TO CHOOSE YOUR WORDS
MORE PRECISELY.

273
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,336
ARE YOU GOING
TO LET HIM GET
AWAY WITH THAT?

274
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,963
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,
MR. SPOCK, HE'LL TWIST
YOUR MEANING.

275
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,591
YES. HE'S
INFURIATING, SIR.

276
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,633
HOW CAN YOU
STAND IT?

277
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,551
WE CANNOT LEAVE

278
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,469
WITHOUT BEING
ABSOLUTELY SURE
OURSELVES

279
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,054
THAT EVERYTHING
HAS BEEN DONE.

280
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,099
NOW, CERTAINLY
YOU UNDERSTAND OUR
FEELINGS ABOUT THAT.

281
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,183
MR. SPOCK? MR. SPOCK?

282
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,143
YES, YOUR EXCELLENCY.

283
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,186
ARE YOU STILL THERE?

284
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,564
YES, YOUR EXCELLENCY.

285
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,609
THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE
INTERFERENCE WITH
YOUR TRANSMISSION.

286
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,111
A LOT OF NOISE
DROWNED OUT WHAT WAS SAID.

287
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,613
WOULD YOU REPEAT, PLEASE?

288
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:50,116
I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE NOISE,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.

289
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,953
TO SUMMARIZE, I REQUEST
PERMISSION TO TRANSPORT
DOWN TO GIDEON.

290
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,538
FORGIVE ME, MR. SPOCK.

291
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,583
NO CRITICISM OF YOUR
EQUIPMENT WAS INTENDED,

292
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,294
BUT IT HAS SENT YOUR CAPTAIN
ON SOME STRANGE JOURNEY--

293
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,463
A SAFE ONE,
WE ALL STILL HOPE,

294
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:07,216
BUT IT COULD CREATE
FOR US SERIOUS INCIDENTS
WITH YOUR FEDERATION,

295
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:11,137
AND NOW YOU PROPOSE
TO REPEAT THIS DISASTER
WITH ANOTHER OFFICER?

296
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,722
THIS WOULD BE MADNESS.

297
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,558
I'LL NOT TAKE THAT,
MR. SPOCK!

298
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,184
THAT TRANSPORTER
WAS IN PERFECT
CONDITION.

299
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,061
I GUARANTEE THAT
MYSELF.

300
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,605
TRANSPORT ME DOWN
RIGHT THIS MINUTE,

301
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,398
AND I'LL PROVE
TO THOSE--

302
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,526
GENTLEMEN--

303
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,488
MR. SCOTT, YOU'LL GO
TO THE TRANSPORTER ROOM
AND AWAIT MY ORDERS.

304
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:29,906
AYE, MR. SPOCK.

305
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,699
[MUTTERING]

306
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,579
I COULD NOT QUITE
MAKE THAT OUT, MR. SPOCK.

307
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,457
WOULD YOU BE SO GOOD
AS TO REPEAT WHAT YOU SAID?

308
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,458
YES, YOUR
EXCELLENCY.

309
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,043
THE SHIP'S ENGINEER
WAS EXPLAINING

310
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:47,256
THAT THE MALFUNCTION
WHICH DID EXIST
HAS NOW BEEN REPAIRED.

311
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,677
WE WOULD APPRECIATE
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEST
THE EQUIPMENT.

312
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,261
I THEREFORE
REQUEST PERMISSION

313
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,722
TO BEAM DOWN
TO YOUR COUNCIL CHAMBER.

314
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,641
BUT, MR. SPOCK, YOU--

315
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,101
YOUR EXCELLENCY.

316
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,854
GRANT THIS ONE REQUEST.

317
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:04,524
YOU ARE A VERY PERSISTENT
FELLOW, MR. SPOCK.

318
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,153
VERY WELL, THEN.

319
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,031
YOU SHALL TEST THE SKILL

320
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,117
OF YOUR VERY EXCITABLE
REPAIRMAN.

321
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,661
THERE IS ONE PROVISO.

322
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,621
WE CANNOT RISK
FURTHER INCIDENTS.

323
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:23,042
YOU WILL THEREFORE
TRANSPORT A MEMBER
OF MY STAFF TO YOUR SHIP.

324
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,670
LET US FIRST SEE
IF THAT WORKS.

325
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,672
THANK YOU,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.

326
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,008
YOUR PROPOSAL
IS ACCEPTED.

327
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:32,927
MR. SCOTT.

328
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,512
SCOTT HERE.

329
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,930
PREPARE TO BEAM ABOARD

330
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,015
A REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE GIDEON COUNCIL.

331
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,808
AYE, AYE, SIR.

332
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,227
MY ASSISTANT WILL PROVIDE
YOU WITH THE PROPER--

333
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,562
WHAT IS THE WORD?

334
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,689
Spock: COORDINATES.

335
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,983
THANK YOU.
PROCEED, KRODAK.

336
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:51,988
875...

337
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,907
Scott: 875...

338
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,867
020...

339
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,577
020...

340
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,537
Krodak: 709.

341
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,081
709.

342
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,208
ENERGIZING.

343
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:22,101
MR. SPOCK, THE GENTLEMAN
FROM GIDEON IS HERE.

344
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,729
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
YOUR ASSISTANT
HAS ARRIVED SAFELY,

345
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,399
AND I AM NOW READY TO
TRANSPORT DOWN TO GIDEON.

346
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,194
NOW, NOW, NOT SO FAST,
MR. SPOCK.

347
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,655
THAT IS QUITE
A DIFFERENT MATTER.

348
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,825
WE AGREED TO ALLOW ONE
REPRESENTATIVE ON OUR SOIL--

349
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,035
YOUR CAPTAIN.

350
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,246
SIR, OUR CAPTAIN
IS STILL MISSING,

351
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:46,459
AND I NOW DEMAND
THAT I BE ALLOWED
TO TRANSPORT TO GIDEON

352
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,794
AS WE AGREED.

353
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,131
FORGIVE ME, MR. SPOCK,
BUT I OVERSTEPPED MY AUTHORITY

354
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,216
WHEN I MADE
THAT AGREEMENT.

355
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,136
HOWEVER, YOUR REQUEST
WILL BE TAKEN UP

356
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,431
AT THE NEXT FULL SESSION
OF GIDEON'S COUNCIL.

357
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,651
MR. SCOTT, BEAM
DOWN THE GENTLEMAN
FROM GIDEON.

358
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,444
YES, MR. SPOCK.

359
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,529
I'M SENDING HIM
STRAIGHT TO THE
SAME COORDINATES.

360
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,075
AND JUST WHEN I WAS
BEGINNING TO THINK

361
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,869
YOU MIGHT FIND
A WHOLE NEW CAREER AS
A DIPLOMAT, MR. SPOCK.

362
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,871
DO NOT GIVE UP
HOPE, DOCTOR.

363
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,206
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
CONTACT STARFLEET
COMMAND.

364
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,917
DEMAND
AN IMMEDIATE REPLY

365
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,920
TO OUR REQUEST
FOR PERMISSION TO
BEAM DOWN TO GIDEON.

366
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,880
YES, MR. SPOCK.

367
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,382
"ENTERPRISE"
TO STARFLEET COMMAND.

368
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,301
"ENTERPRISE"
TO STARFLEET COMMAND.

369
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,428
Kirk: "ENTERPRISE"
TO STARFLEET COMMAND.

370
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,682
"ENTERPRISE"
TO STARFLEET COMMAND.

371
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:47,020
CAPTAIN KIRK HERE.
RED PRIORITY.
RED PRIORITY.

372
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,105
ISN'T IT
IN WORKING ORDER?

373
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,731
IT SEEMS TO BE.

374
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,733
THEN SOMEONE SHOULD
HAVE HEARD YOU.

375
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,070
CAPTAIN KIRK HERE.
PLEASE ANSWER
RED PRIORITY.

376
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,865
PLEASE ANSWER
RED PRIORITY.

377
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,203
WELL, IF SOMEONE
IS LISTENING,
THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING.

378
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,956
WHY SHOULD THEY
DO THAT?

379
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,961
THEY WOULDN'T.

380
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,888
WHAT DID YOU DO?

381
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:22,972
TOOK THE SHIP
OUT OF WARP SPEED.

382
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,515
OUT OF WHAT?

383
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,100
SPACE TERMINOLOGY.

384
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,019
WE'RE NO LONGER
MOVING FASTER THAN
THE SPEED OF LIGHT.

385
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,729
I'VE TRIMMED DOWN
TO SUB LIGHT SPEED

386
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,022
UNTIL WE FIND OUT
WHERE WE ARE.

387
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,940
IT FEELS THE SAME.

388
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,567
OF COURSE IT DOES--

389
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,906
MAYBE IT IS
THE SAME.

390
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,332
WELL? HAS THE SHIP
SLOWED DOWN?

391
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,589
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE
THAT, WE HAVE.

392
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:00,968
OH, PLEASE! DON'T
TELL ME THE SKY IS
OUT OF ORDER NOW.

393
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,519
SO QUIET,

394
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,938
SO PEACEFUL.

395
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,274
IT ISN'T REALLY,
YOU KNOW.

396
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,659
AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

397
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,001
YES. YES, IT IS.

398
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,045
VERY,
VERY BEAUTIFUL.

399
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,089
AND WE'RE ALONE.

400
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,092
CAN YOU MAKE IT LAST
A LONG, LONG TIME?

401
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,761
HOW LONG WOULD YOU
LIKE IT TO LAST?

402
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,056
FOREVER.

403
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,641
WELL, LET'S SEE.

404
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,186
POWER--
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.
IT REGENERATES.

405
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,730
AND FOOD--
WE HAVE ENOUGH

406
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,191
TO FEED A CREW
OF 430 FOR 5 YEARS.

407
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,110
SO THAT SHOULD
LAST US--

408
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,611
FOREVER.

409
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,448
ALL MY LIFE,
I'VE DREAMED
OF BEING ALONE.

410
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,867
MOST PEOPLE ARE AFRAID
OF BEING ALONE.

411
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,369
WHERE I COME FROM,
PEOPLE DREAM OF IT.

412
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,624
WHY? WHY ARE THE PEOPLE
OF GIDEON LIKE THAT?

413
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,335
GIDEON?

414
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,631
I TOLD YOU I DON'T
KNOW WHERE I COME FROM,

415
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,633
WHAT MY PLANET IS.

416
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,179
IT MIGHT BE GIDEON.

417
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,346
DOES IT MATTER
SO MUCH?

418
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,350
YES. IT MIGHT HELP ME
PINPOINT OUR LOCATION.

419
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,230
AND THEN YOU MIGHT
FIND YOUR CREW.

420
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,191
BEING HERE WITH YOU,

421
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,400
I FORGOT
THERE MUST BE OTHERS.

422
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,613
I ENVY YOU
YOUR SENSE OF LOYALTY.

423
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,908
I WANT TO EASE
YOUR FEELING OF DREAD,

424
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:51,578
YOUR FEAR THAT
ALL YOUR CREW
NO LONGER EXISTS.

425
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:04,050
I'VE GOT TO
CONTACT WHOEVER IS
MANIPULATING US.

426
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,177
THERE MUST BE A WAY.

427
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,597
ODONA--

428
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,765
ODONA, CAN YOU...

429
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,644
REMEMBER WHY
YOUR PEOPLE DREAM
OF BEING ALONE?

430
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,648
BECAUSE THEY
NEVER CAN BE.

431
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,235
WHY?

432
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,658
WHAT MAKES IT
SO IMPOSSIBLE TO BE ALONE?

433
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,829
BECAUSE THERE ARE
SO MANY OF US.

434
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,331
SO MANY.

435
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:40,044
THERE IS NO PLACE,
NO STREET,

436
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:45,049
NO HOUSE, NO GARDEN,
NO BEACH,

437
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,761
NO MOUNTAIN
THAT IS NOT FILLED
WITH PEOPLE.

438
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,429
EACH ONE OF US
WOULD KILL

439
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,351
IN ORDER TO FIND A PLACE
ALONE TO HIMSELF.

440
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,811
THEY WOULD WILLINGLY
DIE FOR IT...

441
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,565
IF THEY COULD.

442
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,531
WHO SENT YOU HERE?

443
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,535
NO ONE COMMANDS
ODONA.

444
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,621
I WAS NOT SENT HERE.

445
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,542
HAVE YOU COME TO KILL?

446
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:30,344
ODONA, HAVE YOU
COME TO DIE?

447
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,432
I DON'T KNOW.

448
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,267
I DON'T CARE.

449
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,312
I ONLY KNOW
I'M HERE.

450
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,564
I ONLY KNOW
I'M HAPPY.

451
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,023
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS FIND A MEDICAL KIT,

452
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,859
AND I CAN COMPLETELY
CURE THIS.

453
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,278
CURE?

454
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,280
YES. THE IRRITATION
WILL BE GONE.

455
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,866
WHAT WILL HAPPEN
IF YOU DO NOT FIND ONE?

456
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,076
WILL YOU BECOME
SICK AND DIE?

457
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,495
HA HA! NO.

458
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,163
OVER SOMETHING
AS SIMPLE AS THIS?

459
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,874
NO. IT'LL CURE
ITSELF EVENTUALLY, BUT..

460
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,005
DO YOU KNOW, I--

461
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,716
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
HOW THIS HAPPENED?

462
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:51,717
[CHUCKLES]

463
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,928
[LOW-PITCHED THUMPING]

464
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,763
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

465
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,433
YES.

466
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,227
IT SOUNDS LIKE
AN ENGINE.

467
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:06,065
NO. THE SHIP'S ENGINES
DON'T MAKE THAT KIND
OF SOUND.

468
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,025
BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE EQUIPMENT.

469
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,609
COULD THAT BE IT?

470
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,113
I KNOW EVERY SOUND
THAT THIS SHIP MIGHT MAKE.

471
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,909
THAT'S COMING
FROM OUTSIDE.

472
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,994
A STORM MIGHT--

473
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,372
A STORM MIGHT,

474
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,623
BUT YOU WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO HEAR IT.

475
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,128
COME ON.

476
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,802
THIS IS
A VIEWING PORT.

477
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,304
WE'LL BE ABLE
TO SEE OUTSIDE.

478
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,140
IF THERE'S A STORM,
WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IT.

479
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,478
IF IT WORKS.

480
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,452
PEOPLE.

481
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,579
THE FACES OF PEOPLE!

482
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:05,416
AND THEN STARS.

483
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,839
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

484
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,841
WHAT'S OUT THERE?

485
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,602
THE SOUND IS GONE.

486
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,064
IT WAS LIKE
THE HEARTBEAT
OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE,

487
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,858
AND THOUSANDS
UPON THOUSANDS MORE,

488
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,651
PRESSING AGAINST
THE SHIP.

489
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,824
BUT YOU SAID WE WERE
MOVING THROUGH SPACE.

490
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,410
YES, I SAID THAT.

491
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,870
THEN THE PEOPLE
CAN'T BE OUT THERE.

492
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,747
YES, THEY CAN.

493
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,666
PLEASE DON'T
FRIGHTEN ME.

494
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,713
IT COULD
BE A MIRAGE.

495
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,383
THEY COULD EXIST
IN OUR MINDS.

496
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,178
YOU MEAN THAT
WE'RE GOING MAD.

497
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,559
OR SOME POWER IS
CREATING THE ILLUSION
IN OUR MINDS

498
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:09,271
THAT WE ARE SOMEWHERE
NEAR YOUR PLANET.

499
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,027
BUT WHY?

500
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,531
I DON'T KNOW.

501
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,575
I DON'T KNOW!

502
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,460
I THINK I HAVE
AN IDEA.

503
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,422
SO THAT WE WON'T KEEP
TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHERE WE ARE,

504
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,924
THAT WE'LL BE CONTENT
TO STAY HERE.

505
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,136
BE CONTENT!

506
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,932
BE CONTENT?

507
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,727
BE CONTENT?

508
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,104
NOT UNTIL I FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CREW.

509
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,272
ARE THEY DEAD?

510
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,773
I DON'T KNOW!

511
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,109
DID YOU KILL THEM
SO YOU COULD HAVE
THE SHIP TO YOURSELF?

512
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,572
CAPTAIN--

513
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:06,495
CAPTAIN, SOMETHING'S
HAPPENING TO ME.

514
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,540
I NEVER FELT
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

515
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:13,210
I'VE NEVER FELT
LIKE THIS BEFORE EITHER.

516
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,462
IS THIS THE WAY
ONE LOOKS

517
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:20,759
WHEN ONE
IS DEVELOPING
A SICKNESS?

518
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:26,139
THERE'S NO SICKNESS
ON YOUR PLANET, REMEMBER?

519
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,522
NOW THERE WILL BE.

520
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,232
THERE WILL
BE SICKNESS.

521
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,612
THERE WILL BE DEATH.

522
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,735
HODIN!

523
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,695
YES, CAPTAIN KIRK.

524
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,114
OUR EXPERIMENT HAS PASSED
THE FIRST STAGE.

525
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,283
LET ME IN THERE.
I CAN HELP HER.

526
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,787
WE HAVE NO NEED
OF ANY OF YOUR MEDICINES.

527
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,204
BUT SHE'S ILL!

528
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,500
AND WE ARE GRATEFUL
TO YOU FOR HER ILLNESS.

529
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,918
YOU HAVE DONE WELL,
MY DAUGHTER.

530
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,596
GUARD THE CAPTAIN WELL.

531
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,223
WE SHALL NEED HIM
FOR A LONG TIME.

532
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,990
Man: I SYMPATHIZE
DEEPLY,

533
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,034
BUT STARFLEET
CANNOT OVERRIDE
FEDERATION DIRECTIVES

534
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,452
IN THIS MATTER.

535
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,372
ADMIRAL, THE CREW
WILL NOT UNDERSTAND IT.

536
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,708
HAS YOUR CREW
SUDDENLY BECOME
INTERESTED

537
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,167
IN PROVOKING A WAR?

538
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,127
THAT IS NOT
STARFLEET'S MISSION.

539
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,589
WE WISH ONLY TO SAVE
THE LIFE OF THE CAPTAIN.

540
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,383
YOU HAVE NOT
PROVED YOUR CASE
TO THE FEDERATION--

541
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,385
OR TO STARFLEET,
FOR THAT MATTER.

542
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,637
I AM POSITIVE
THAT I CAN DO SO

543
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,139
TO YOUR SATISFACTION,
ADMIRAL.

544
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,267
I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED
SINCE MY FIRST EXCHANGE
WITH THE AMBASSADOR

545
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,228
THAT THE CAPTAIN HAS
BEEN TAKEN PRISONER.

546
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,689
GRANTED AS FACT,
MR. SPOCK.

547
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,233
I NOW KNOW
WHERE THE CAPTAIN
IS BEING HELD,

548
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,318
IF HE IS BEING HELD
AT THE SAME PLACE

549
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,028
TO WHICH WE
TRANSPORTED HIM.

550
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,156
THEY WOULD NOT DARE
HARM HIM IN THE GIDEON
COUNCIL CHAMBER.

551
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:53,579
SIR, THE CAPTAIN
IS NOT BEING HELD IN
THE GIDEON COUNCIL CHAMBER.

552
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:54,954
HE IS BEING HELD
NEARBY.

553
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,457
YOU HAVE NOW
ANSWERED WHAT
AND WHERE.

554
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,793
I'M WAITING FOR
YOUR EXPLANATION
OF WHY.

555
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,671
SINCE THE PLANET
IS SHIELDED
FROM OUR SENSORS,

556
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,256
WE CANNOT ESTABLISH THAT

557
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,425
WITHOUT ON-THE-SPOT
INVESTIGATION.

558
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,052
DO YOU HAVE EVIDENCE
THE CAPTAIN'S LIFE
IS THREATENED?

559
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,306
PERMISSION DENIED.

560
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,309
ADMIRAL, I WISH
TO STATE FOR THE RECORD

561
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,353
THAT YOUR DECISION
IS COMPLETELY ARBITRARY.

562

SO NOTED.

563
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,237
WILL IT LAST LONG?

564
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:33,243
THAT DEPENDS
ON THE STRENGTH
OF THE ONE INFECTED.

00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,621
YOU HAVE
GREAT STRENGTH.

566

WHEN I AM TO DIE?

WILL BE VERY GREAT.

568
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:48,258
YOU WILL SEE US,
BUT YOU WILL NOT
KNOW WHO WE ARE.

569
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,677
I MUST SEE HIM
BEFORE THEN, FATHER.

IS HEAVY

YOU CAN DO NOTHING.

GIVES ME GREAT PRIDE.

584
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,778
LET ME SEE HER.

YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE MAY HAVE.

587
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:58,036
BUT WE DO. SHE HAS
VEGAN CHORIOMENINGITIS.

588

THAT'S VERY RARE
AND ALWAYS FATAL

IF NOT TREATED

KILLED ME.

LEARNED ABOUT YOU DURING

BROUGHT YOU HERE.

GOT HURT.

NO. WE ARE DESPERATE.

601
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,793

HOW STARFLEET CAN
DENY US PERMISSION

602
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,212
TO BEAM DOWN TO SEARCH
FOR THE CAPTAIN.

603
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,673
THEY DID NOT
ASK FOR OUR
UNDERSTANDING, DOCTOR.

604
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,466
I DON'T SEE HOW
THEY EXPECT US
TO SIT HERE

605
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,969
AND WAIT
FOR THE CAPTAIN
TO REAPPEAR.

606
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,889
UNFORTUNATELY, I MUST
VIOLATE A DIRECT ORDER
FROM STARFLEET.

POSSIBLE DECISION YOU
COULD MAKE, SPOCK.

LIGHTLY, DOCTOR.

ASKING YOU TO MAKE
THE DECISION FOR ME.

TO DO SO, DOCTOR.

IN THAT CASE, IT'S
THE WORST POSSIBLE DECISION
YOU CAN MAKE, SPOCK.

TAKE LONG.

YOUR REPORT TO

A TISSUE OF LIES!

637
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,347
YOU DESCRIBED

AND SO IT WAS.

WHAT WE DESCRIBED WAS TRUE.

00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:18,862
THE ATMOSPHERE ON GIDEON
HAS ALWAYS BEEN GERMFREE,

643
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,613
AND THE PEOPLE FLOURISHED

00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,039
YOU WILL STAY.

AVAILABLE TO YOU.

I HAVE MENTIONED
ONLY A FEW.

696
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,926
I DO NOT OFFER MY LIFE
FOR THIS PURPOSE.

OTHER THAN DEATH
FOR ODONA.

WITH YOU TO STAY.

HAPPENED BETWEEN US
WAS FOR US ALONE.

YOU WOULD LOVE HER
AND WISH TO STAY.

THAT I WOULD FALL
SO UNDER HER SPELL

THAT I
WOULD GIVE UP
MY FREEDOM

AND BECOME
A WILLING SACRIFICE.

LEAVE US NOW.

AND THEY WERE CORRECT.

723
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,536
I AM ON BOARD
AN EXACT DUPLICATE
OF THE "ENTERPRISE."

724

725
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:05,375
IS IT IN ORBIT,

IN ORBIT, DOCTOR?

727
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,129
IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING.

728
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,299
GIDEON IS IN ORBIT,
AND THE SHIP IS ON GIDEON.

A BEGINNING,

00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,387
BUT WHAT ABOUT

00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,432

HE'S ON BOARD SOMEWHERE.

BE NO INTERFERENCE
