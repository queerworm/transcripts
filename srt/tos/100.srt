3
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,853
Check the circuit.

4
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,062
All operating, sir.

5
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,522
It can't be
the screen then.

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,067
Definitely something
out there, captain.

7
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,402
Headed this way.

8
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,656
TYLER:
Could be these meteroids.

9
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,324
ONE:
No. It's something else.

10
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,951
There's still
something out there.

11
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,705
( alarm beeping )

12
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,629
It's coming
at the speed of light.

13
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,006
Collision course.

14
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,439
The meteorite beam has not
deflected it, captain.

15
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,191
Evasive maneuvers, sir?
Steady as we go.

16
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,911
( alarm stops )

17
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,163
It's a radio wave, sir.

18
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,625
We're passing through
an old-style distress signal.

19
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,087
They were keyed
to cause interference

20
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,547
and attract attention
this way.

21
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,758
A ship in trouble making
a forced landing, sir.

22
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,551
GARISON:
That's it.
No other message.

23
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,639
I have a fix. It comes from
the Talos star group.

24
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,557
We've no ships or
Earth colonies that far out.

25
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,060
Their call letters check
with a survey expedition--

26
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,645
S.S. Columbia.

27
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,648
Disappeared in that region
approximately 18 years ago.

28
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,691
It would take that long
for a radio beam

29
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,026
to travel from there to here.

30
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,947
Records show the Talos group
has never been explored.

31
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:38,575
Solar system similar to Earth.
Eleven planets.

32
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,537
Number four seems
to be Class M--

33
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,331
oxygen atmosphere.

34
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,585
And they could still be alive,
even after 18 years.

35
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,337
If they survived the crash.

36
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,132
We aren't going to go
to be certain?

37
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:56,093
Not without any indication
of survivors, no.

38
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,345
We'll continue on
to the Vega Colony

39
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,348
and take care of our own sick
and injured first.

40
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,642
You have the helm.
Maintain present course.

41
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,102
ONE:
Yes, sir.

42
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,582

PIKE:
Drop by my cabin, doctor.

45
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,261
( knock on door )

46
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,688
What's that?

47
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,232
I didn't say there was
anything wrong with me.

48
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,154
I understand we picked up
a distress signal.

49
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,949
That's right.
Unless we get anything

50
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,910
more positive on it,
it seems to me the condition

51
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,037
of our own crew
takes precedent.

52
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,873
I'd like to log the ship's
doctor's opinion, too.

53
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,667
Oh, I concur with yours,
definitely.

54
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,754
Good. I'm glad you do.

55
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,256
'Cause we're going to stop
first at the Vega Colony

56
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,633
and replace anybody
who needs hospitalization

57
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,343
and also--
( ice clinks )

58
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,346
What the devil are you
putting in there? Ice?

59
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,307
Who wants
a warm martini?

60
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,520
What makes you think
I need one?

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,191
Sometimes a man will
tell his bartender

62
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,236
things he'll never
tell his doctor.

63
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,865
What's been
on your mind, Chris?

64
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,700
The fight
on Rigel VII?

65
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,703
Shouldn't it be?

66
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,039
My only yeoman and
two others dead, seven injured.

67
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,498
Was there anything
you personally

68
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,917
could've done
to prevent it?

69
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,585
Oh, I should have
smelled trouble when I saw

70
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,212
the swords and the armor.
Instead of that,

71
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,214
I let myself get trapped
in that deserted fortress

72
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,715
and attacked by one
of their warriors.

73
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,341
Oh, Chris you set
standards for yourself

74
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,427
no one could meet.
you treat everyone on board

75
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,304
like a human being
except yourself.

76
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,640
And now, you're tired,
and you--

77
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,850
You bet I'm tired.

78
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,769
You bet.

79
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,605
I'm tired of being
responsible for 203 lives.

80
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,441
I'm tired of deciding
which mission is too risky

81
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,901
and which isn't,
and who's going

82
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,987
on the landing party
and who doesn't,

83
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,948
and who lives...

84
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,033
and who dies.

85
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,954
Boy, I've had it, Phil.

86
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,456
To the point of finally
taking my advice,

87
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,833
a rest leave?

88
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,044
To the point
of considering resigning.

89
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,839
And do what?

90
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,133
Well, for one thing,
go home.

91
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,886
Nice little town

92
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,639
with 50 miles
of parkland around it.

93
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,393
Remember I told you
I had two horses?

94
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,604
Used to take some food
and ride out all day.

95
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,439
Ah, that sounds exciting.

96
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,775
Ride out with
a picnic lunch every day.

97
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,444
I said that's one place
I might go.

98
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,990
Or I'd go into
business on Regulus

99
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,325
or on the Orion colony.

100
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,742
You, an Orion trader,

101
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,911
dealing in green animal
women, slaves?

102
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,247
The point is that this
isn't the only life available.

103
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,582
There's a whole galaxy
of things to choose from.

104
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,959
Not for you.

105
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,965
A man either lives life
as it happens to him,

106
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,093
meets it head-on
and licks it, or he...

107
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,928
turns his back on it

108
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,763
and starts
to wither away.

109
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,267
Now you're beginning to talk
like a doctor, bartender.

110
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,311
Take your choice.

111
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,855
We both get the same
two kinds of customers--

112
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,358
the living
and the dying.

113
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,403

Yes, sir.

I thought I told you that
when I'm on the bridge--

00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,346
But you wanted
the reports by 0500.

It's 0500 now, sir.

She does a good job,
all right.

141
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,870
It's just that
I can't get used

to having

Is Earth all right?

189

The same old Earth,
and you'll see it very soon.

190
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,793
And you won't believe
how fast you can get back.

You appear to be healthy

208

and intelligent, captain.

209
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,090
A prime specimen.

You must forgive
her choice of words, captain.

She's lived her whole life

215
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,566

of aging scientists.

216

If they can spare you
a moment,

217
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,070
I'd like to make
my medical report.

218
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,448
I think it's time
to show the captain our secret.

220
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,661
almost too good.

221
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,788
There's a reason
for our condition,

222
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,832
but we've had some doubt
if Earth is ready

223
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,876

224
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,586

I don't understand.

232
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,508
You will.

The inhabitants
of this planet

290
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,184

291
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,187
Probably manufacture food
and other needs down there.

292
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,398
Now, our tests indicate
the planet's surface,

293
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,026
without considerably
more vegetation or some animals,

294
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,819
is simply too barren
to support life.

295
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,029
So we just thought

296
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,031
we saw survivors
there, Mr. Spock.

297
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,490
Exactly. An illusion,

298
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,035
placed in our minds by
this planet's inhabitants.

299
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,995
It was a perfect illusion.

300
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,290
They had us seeing
just what we wanted to see,

301
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,376
human beings who'd survived
with dignity and bravery,

302
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,212

entirely logical

everything.

306
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:44,344
Now, let's be sure we understand
the danger of this.

307
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,098
The inhabitants of this planet
can read our minds.

308
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,475
They can create illusions
out of a person's

309

own thoughts, memories,
and experiences,

310
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,814
even out of
a person's own desires.

311
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,441
Illusions just as real
and solid as this table top,

312
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,193
and just as impossible
to ignore.

313
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,155
Any estimate what they might
want one of us for?

314
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,907
They may simply be
studying the captain

315
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,951

are put together.

316
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,495

something more.

doing anything?

up against hand lasers,

319
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,876
but we can transfer
the ship's power against it--

320
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,336
enough to blast
half a continent.

If we start buzzing about
down there,

324
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,345
we're liable to find
their mental power is so great,

325
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,015
they could reach out
and swat this ship

It's Captain Pike
they've got.

328

He needs help,
and he probably needs it fast.

called Vina.

Or rather,
the image of Vina.

364
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,041
But why you again?

365
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,002
Why didn't they create
a different girl?

368
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,810

I won't go along with it.

I'm not an animal

It doesn't matter
what you call this.

374
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,703
You'll feel it--
that's what matters--

00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,206
you'll feel every moment
of whatever happens to you.

To please you.

No, that's not any answer.

402
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,838

00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,097
Well I have
to wear something.

Don't I?

407
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,977
Or I can wear
whatever you wish,

408
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,770
or be anything you wish.

409
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,441
So they can see how their
specimen performs?

410
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,569
They want to see how I react.
Is that it?

411
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:00,072
Don't you have a dream,

something you've always
wanted very badly?

413
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,910
Or do they do more
than just watch me?

414
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,247
Do they...
feel with me, too?

415
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:12,125
You can have
whatever dream you want.

Is there any way

Maybe it was.

It's what I tried to explain
in the briefing room.

455
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,772
Their power
of illusion is so great,

456
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,233
we can't be sure
of anything we do...

457
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,360
or anything we see.

458
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,370
Perhaps if you asked me

459
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,331
some questions
I could answer.

460
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,336
How far can they
control my mind?

461
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,005
If I tell you,

462
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,091
then will you pick
some dream you've had

463
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,051
and let me
live it with you?

464
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,763
Perhaps.

465
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:12,931
They can't actually
make you do

00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,349
anything you don't want to--

467
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,184
But they try to trick me with
their illusions.

468
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,020
And they can punish you
when you're not cooperative.

469
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,106
You'll find out about that.

470
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:25,026
Did they ever live
on the surface of this planet?

471
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,070
Why did they go underground?

472
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,782
War,
thousands of centuries ago.

473
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,700
That's why
it's so barren up there?

474
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,745
The planet's only now becoming
able to support life again.

475
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,497
So the Talosians
who came underground

476
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,957
found life limited here

477
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,542
and they concentrated
on developing

478
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,835
their mental power.

479
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,630
But they found
it's a trap,

480
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,089
like a narcotic.

481
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,425
Because when dreams

482
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,677
become more important
than reality,

483
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,555
you give up travel,
building, creating.

484
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,475
You even forget how
to repair the machines

485
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,560
left behind by your ancestors.

486
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,815
You just sit, living
and reliving other lives

487
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,942
left behind
in the thought record.

488
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,903
Or sit probing the minds
of zoo specimens like me.

489
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,863
You're better
than the theater to them.

490
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,281
They create an illusion
for you.

491
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,660
They watch you react,
feel your emotions.

492
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,329
They have a whole collection
of specimens,

493
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,957
descendants of life
brought back long ago

494
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:22,250
from all over
this part of the galaxy.

495
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,921
Which means they had to have

496
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,757
more than one
of each animal.

497
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,300
Please.

498
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,969

of humans too.

is not appealing,

it can appear as any food you
wish to visualize.

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,775
You were startled.

538
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,360
Weren't you
reading my mind then?

539
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,820
As you've conjectured,

540
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,238
an Earth vessel
did crash on our planet,

541
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,324
but with only
a single survivor.

542
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,326
No, let's stay
on the first subject.

543
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,078
All I wanted
for that moment was

544
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,955
to get my hands
around your neck.

545
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,207
We repaired
the survivor's injuries

546
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,918
and found the species
interesting.

547
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,253
Do primitive thoughts put up a
block you can't read through?

548
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,756
It became necessary
to attract a mate.

549
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,301
All right, all right,
let's talk about the girl.

550
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,596
You seem to be going out of
your way to make her attractive,

551
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,348
to make me feel protective.

552
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,558
This is necessary

553
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,476
in order to perpetuate
the species.

554
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,937
It seems
more important to you now

555
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,149
that I begin to accept her
and like her.

556
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,776
We wish our specimens
to be happy

557
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,028
in their new life.

558
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,363
Assuming that's a lie,

559
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,657
why would you want me
attracted to her?

560
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,995
So I'll feel love in a
husband-wife relationship?

561
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,122
That would be necessary
only if you intend

562
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,331
to build a family group

563
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,084
or perhaps a whole
human community.

564
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:35,587
With the female now
properly conditioned.

565
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,047
You mean properly punished!

566
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,008
I'm the one who's not
cooperating.

567
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,843
Why don't you punish me?

568
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:45,304
First, an emotion
of protectiveness,

569
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,516
now one of sympathy.

570
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,936
Excellent.

571
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,154
VINA:
You want some coffee, dear?

572
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,950
( birds chirping )

573
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,661
(<i> peaceful theme playing</i> )

574
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,083
I left the thermos
hooked to my saddle.

575
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,427
( whinnies )

576
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,559
Tango!

577
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,104
You old devil, you.

578
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,522
Sorry I don't have
any su--

579
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:42,237
Well, they think of everything,
don't they?

580
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,742
VINA:
Hey! The coffee.

581
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,793
Is it good to be home?

582
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,545
They read our minds very well.

583
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,340
Home, anything else I want

584
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,009
if I cooperate.
Is that it?

585
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:07,137
Have you forgotten
my headaches, darling?

586
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,555
I get them when you talk
strangely like this.

587
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,057
Look, I'm sorry
they punish you

588
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,350
but we can't let them--

589
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,601
My, it turned out

590
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,228
to be a lovely day,
didn't it?

591
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,441
It's funny.

592
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,235
Just about 24 hours ago,

593
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,778
I was telling
the ship's doctor

594
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,238
how much I wanted something

595
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,991
not very different
from what we have here.

596
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,118
An escape from reality,

597
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:34,580
a life with no frustrations,
no responsibilities.

598
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,291
Now that I have it,

599
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,750
I understand
the doctor's answer.

600
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,919
I hope you're hungry.

601
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,629
These little white sandwiches

602
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,923
are your mother's recipe
for chicken tuna.

603
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,551
'Cause you either
live life,

604
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,720
bruises,
skinned knees, and all,

605
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,973
or you turn your back on it
and start dying.

606
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,814
The doctor's going to be
happy about one part, at least--

607
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,358
He said
I needed a rest.

608
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,362
Well, this is
a lovely place to rest.

609
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:08,447
Yeah, I used to ride through
here when I was a kid.

610
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,950
It's not as pretty as
some of the parkland

611
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,245
around the big cities, but...

612
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,705
That's Mojave.
That's where I was born.

613
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,958
That's supposed to be
news to your wife?

614
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,426
You're home.
You can even stay if you want.

615
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,095
Wouldn't it be nice

616
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,471
showing your children
where you once played?

617
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:36,351
These headaches, they'll be
hereditary you know.

618
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,937
Would you wish them on a child
or a whole group of children?

619
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,230
It's foolish.

620
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,522
Is it?

621
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,400
Look...

622
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,402
first, they made me
protect you

623
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,320
and then feel
sympathy for you.

624
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,031
And now, we have these
familiar surroundings

625
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:53,368
and a comfortable
husband-wife relationship.

626
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,121
Well, they don't need
all this for just passion.

627
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:59,457
What they're after is respect
and mutual dependence.

628
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,542
They say in the olden days,

629
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:05,088
all this was a desert,
just blowing sand and cactus.

630
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,673
But we're not here,
neither of us!

631
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,550
We're in a menagerie, a cage.

632
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,802
No!

633
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,220
I can't help
either one of us

634
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,554
if you won't
give me a chance.

635
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,847
You told me once

636
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,142
they used illusions
as a narcotic.

637
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,311
They couldn't even
repair the machines

638
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,062
left by their ancestors.

639
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,855
Is that why they want us,

640
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,523
to build a colony of slaves?

641
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,025
Stop it!

642
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,611
Don't you care
what they'll do to us?

643
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,155
Back in my cage,

644
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,614
it seemed for a couple of
minutes

645
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,366
that our keeper
couldn't read my thoughts.

646
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,701
Do emotions like hate--

647
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,745
keeping hate
in your mind--

648
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,039
does that block off
our mind from them?

649
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,709
Yes.

650
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,879
They can't read through

651
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,631
primitive emotions.

652
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,592
But you can't
keep it up for long enough.

653
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,011
I've tried.

654
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:57,056
They keep at you and at you,
year after year,

655
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,641
tricking and punishing.

656
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,977
And they won.

657
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,021
They own me.

658
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:06,274
(<i> melancholy theme playing</i> )

659
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,443
I know you must
hate me for that.

660
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,446
Oh, no,
I don't hate you.

661
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:14,407
I can guess
what it was like.

662
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,161
But that's not enough.

663
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,912
Don't you see?

664
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:23,375
They read my thoughts,
my feelings,

665
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:27,920
my dreams of what would be
a perfect man.

666
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,049
And that's why
they picked you.

667
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,969
I can't help
but love you,

668
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,931
and they expect you
to feel the same way.

669
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,933
If they can read
my mind,

670
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,977
then they know
I'm attracted to you.

down inside

are an illusion also,

00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,850
Captain!

714
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,687
Captain?

715
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:57,273
No! Let me finish!

716
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,277
But we were a party of six.

717
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,237
We were the only ones
transported.

718
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,906
It's not fair.
You don't need them.

719
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,457
They don't work.

720
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,709
They were fully charged
when we left.

721
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,505
It's dead.
I can't make a signal.

722
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,799
What is it?

723
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:25,176
Don't-- don't say anything.

724
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:28,387
I'm filling my mind
with a picture

725
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,433
of beating their huge,
misshapen heads to pulp!

726
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,935
Thoughts so primitive,
they black out everything else.

727
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,937
I'm filling my mind
with hate!

728
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,357
How long can you
block your thoughts--

729
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,108
A few minutes, an hour?

730
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,485
How can that help?

731
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,362
Leave him alone.

732
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:45,988
He doesn't need you.

733
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,948
He's already picked me.

734
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,575
Picked her?
For what?

735
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,369
I don't understand.

736
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:55,247
Now, there's a fine choice
for intelligent offspring.

737
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,709
Offspring?
As in children?

738
00:47:57,709 --> 00:48:00,503
Offspring as in he's Adam.

739
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,796
Is that it?

740
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,922
You're no better choice.

741
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,843
They'd have more luck
crossing him with a computer.

742
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,055
Well, shall we do
a little time computation?

743
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,140
There was a Vina
listed on that expedition

744
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,851
as an adult crewman.

745
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:17,645
Now, adding 18 years
to your age then--

746
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,522
( chimes )
( no audio )

747
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,111
It's not fair!

748
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,905
I did what you asked!

749
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:31,200
MAGISTRATE:
Since you resist
the present specimen,

750
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,035
you now have a selection.

751
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,911
I'll break out
of this zoo somehow

752
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,831
and get to you.

753
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,500
Is your blood red like ours?

754
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,793
I'm going to find out.

755
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,837
Each of the two new specimens

756
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,963
has qualities in her favor.

757
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,091
The female you call
Number One

758
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,509
has the superior mind

759
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,927
and would produce highly
intelligent children.

760
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,556
Although she seems
to lack emotion,

761
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,307
this is largely a pretense.

762
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,852
She often has fantasies
involving you.

763
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,688
All I want to do
is get my hands on you.

764
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,107
Can you read
these thoughts--

765
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,443
images of hate, killing?

766
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,152
The other new arrival

767
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,321
has considered you
unreachable,

768
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,657
but now is realizing
this has changed.

769
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:15,119
The factors in her favor
are youth and strength

770
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,790
plus unusually strong
female drives.

771
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,459
You'll find my thoughts
more interesting,

772
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,169
thoughts so primitive,
you can't understand,

773
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,255
emotions so ugly--
Ugh!

774
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,591
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

775
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,513
MAGISTRATE:
Wrong thinking
is punishable.

776
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,892
Right thinking
will be as quickly rewarded.

777
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:42,062
You will find it
an effective combination.

778
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,237
( gasping )

779
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,406
Captain.
No.

780
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,575
No. Don't help me.

781
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,993
I have to concentrate.

782
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:59,413
They can't read
through hate.

783
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,300
Address intercraft.

784
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,969
Open, sir.

785
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:15,262
This is the acting captain
speaking.

786
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,055
We have no choice now

787
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,891
but to consider
the safety of this vessel

788
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,309
and the remainder of the crew.

789
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,312
We're leaving.

790
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,523
SPOCK:
All decks prepare
for hyperdrive.

791

Time warp factor--

792
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,443
Mr. Spock, the ship's controls
have gone dead!

793
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:32,237
Engine room!

794
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,948
GARISON:
Open.

795
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,158
Mr. Spock here. Switch to
rockets we're blasting out.

<i>We've got nothing.</i>
There's nothing.

798
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,497
Every system aboard
is fading out!

Now, you hold still,
or I'll break your--

803
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,704
Don't hurt him!
They don't mean to be evil.

804
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:23,414
I've had some samples
of how good they are.

805
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,628
( roars )

806
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,845
You stop this illusion,

807
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,179
or I'll twist
your head off!

808
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:48,647
All right.

809
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,692
You try one more illusion,
you try anything at all,

810
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,652
and I'll break your neck.

811
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,780
Your ship.

812
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,657
Release me,

813
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:02,118
or we'll destroy it.

814
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,794

SPOCK:
Nothing.

If not for the batteries,

817
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,382
we'd lose gravitation, oxygen.

818
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,508
( alarm sounds )

819
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,343
TYLER:
The computers!

820
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:24,976
I can't shut it off!

821
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,602
It's running
through our library--

822
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,520
Tapes, microrecords,
everything.

823
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,022
It doesn't make sense!

824
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:32,691
Could be
we've waited too long.

825
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:37,863
It's collecting all the
information stored in this fly.

826
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,907
They've decided to swat us.

827
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:44,286
He's not bluffing,
captain.

828
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,372
With illusion they can make your
crew work the wrong controls

829
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,166
or push any button
it takes to destroy your ship.

830
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,671
I'm going to gamble
you're too intelligent

831
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,673
to kill for no reason
at all.

832
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,690
On the other hand,
I've got a reason.

833
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,984
I'm willing to bet
you've created an illusion

834
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:16,485
this laser is empty.

835
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,737
I think it just
blasted a hole in that window,

836
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,489
and you're keeping
us from seeing it.

837
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:23,283
You want me to test my theory
out on your head?

838
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,245
Captain!

839
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,462
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

840
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,205
Make contact, Number One.

841
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,498
They kept us
from seeing this too.

842
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,584
We cut through
and never knew it.

843
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,795
Captain!

844
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,551
As you see,

845
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:25,429
your attempt to escape
accomplished nothing.

846
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,181
I want to contact
our ship.

847
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:31,267
You are now on the surface,
where we wished you to be.

848
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:34,605
With the female
of your choice,

849
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:38,067
you will now begin
carefully guided lives.

850
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:40,194
And start
by burying you?

851
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,654
That is your choice.

852
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:46,075
To help you reclaim
the planet's surface,

853
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:47,826
our zoological gardens

854
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,286
will furnish
a variety of plant life.

855
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:52,248
Look,
I'll make a deal with you--

856
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:56,001
you and your life for the lives
of these two Earth women.

857
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,088
Since our lifespan
is many times yours,

858
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:01,966
we have time
to evolve you

859
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,135
into a society
trained to serve

860
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,137
as artisans,
technicians--

861
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:07,846
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

862
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,681
You give me proof that
our ship is all right,

863
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:13,269
send these two back,
and I'll stay with Vina.

864
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,444
It's wrong to create
a whole race of humans

865
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,904
to live as slaves.

866
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,615
Is this a deception?

867
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:28,659
Do you intend
to destroy yourselves?

868
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,952
What is that?

869
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,578
The weapon is building up
an overload--

870
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,122
A forced chamber
explosion.

871
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,708
You still have time
to get underground.

872
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,045
Well, go on!

873
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,966
( weapon humming )

874
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,509
And just to show you

875
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,803
how primitive humans
are, Talosian,

876
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:50,055
you go with her.

877
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,143
If--if you all think
it's this important,

878
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,812
then I can't go, either.

879
00:55:56,812 --> 00:56:00,024
I suppose if they have
one human being,

880
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,817
they might try again.

881
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:07,239
Wait!

882
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,409

TALOSIAN:
<i>Their method</i>
<i>of storing records</i>

884
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,290

<i>and consumed much time.</i>

00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,500
<i>Are you prepared</i>
<i>to assimilate it?</i>

886
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:37,228
We had not believed
this possible.

887
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:40,438
The customs and history
of your race

888
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:43,901
show a unique hatred
of captivity.

889
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,821
Even when it's pleasant
and benevolent,

890
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,531
you prefer death.

891
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:53,285
This makes you too violent
and dangerous a species

892
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,037
for our needs.

893
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,707
He means that
they can't use you.

894
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,876
You're free to go
back to the ship.

895
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,090
And that's it?

896
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,760
No apologies?

897
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,470
You captured one of us,
threatened all of us.

898
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:16,474
Your unsuitability
has condemned the Talosian race

899
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,269
to eventual death.

900
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:20,271
Is this not sufficient?

901
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:24,024
No other specimen
has shown your adaptability.

902
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:26,193
You were our last hope.

903
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,988
But wouldn't some
form of trade,

904
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,740
mutual co-operation...

905
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:35,035
Your race would learn
our power of illusion

906
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:38,205
and destroy itself too.
( communicator whistles )

907
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,707
Captain, we have
transporter control now.

908
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,050
Let's get back to the ship.

909
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:56,890
I can't.

910
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,725
I can't go with you.

911
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,228
PITCAIRN:
Sir, it just came on.
We can't shut the power off.

912
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:03,063
( communicator whistles )
Mr. Spock here.

913
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,232
TYLER ( over comms ):
<i>All power has come on,</i>
<i>Mr. Spock.</i>

914
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:07,567
<i>The helm is answering to</i>
<i>control.</i>

915
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,491
( transporter humming )

916
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,095
The captain?

917
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,222
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

918
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,385
You see why
I can't go with you?

919
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:18,430
This is the female's
true appearance.

920
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:22,767
They found me
in the wreckage

921
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:26,230
dying,
a lump of flesh.

922
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:29,107
They rebuilt me.

923
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,026
Everything works,

924
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:34,738
but they had
never seen a human.

925
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:37,408
They had no guide

926
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:39,910
for putting me back together.

927
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,345
It was necessary
to convince you

928
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:00,680
her desire to stay
is an honest one.

929
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,058
You'll give her back
her illusion of beauty?

930
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:06,019
And more.

931
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:11,900
(<i> melancholy theme playing</i> )

932
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,337
She has an illusion,

933
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,214
and you have reality.

934
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:37,551
May you find your way
as pleasant.

935
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,978
PITCAIRN:
Mr. Spock, the system is
coming on again.

936
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,195
( transporter humming )

937
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,873
What's happened to Vina?

938
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:10,167
Isn't she coming with us?

939
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,793
No.

940
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:15,297
No, and I agreed
with her reasons.

941
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,100
Hold on a minute.

942
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,977
Oh, I feel fine.
Just fine.

943
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,646
Yeah. You look
100 percent better.

944
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:32,772
You recommended a rest
and change of pace, didn't you?

945
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,275
Mm-hmm.
I've even been home.

946
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,319
Does that make you happy?

947
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,615
Yeoman.
Yes, sir.

948
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:43,659
I told you that when
I'm on the bridge, I--

949
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,827
Oh.

950
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,372
Oh, yes, the--
the reports.

951
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,165
Thank you.

952
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:51,916
Sir,

953
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,627
I was wondering,

954
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,253
just curious.

955
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,713
Who would have been Eve?

956
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,048
Yeoman!

957
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,799
You've delivered your report.

958
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,594
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, sir.

959
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:08,058
Eve, sir?

960
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:10,686
Yes, sir.

961
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,692
Eve as in Adam?

962
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,112
As in all ship's doctors

963
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,906
are dirty old men.

964
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:26,535
What are we running here,
a cadet ship, Number One?

965
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:27,827
Are we ready or not?

966
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,371
All decks show ready, sir.

967
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,207
Engage.

968
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:35,210
