00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,380
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 4307.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:10,511
<i>APPROACHING STARBASE 6</i>
<i>FOR A MUCH NEEDED PERIOD</i>
<i>OF REST AND RECREATION.</i>

3
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,221
THIS CREW HAS PERFORMED
EXCELLENTLY,

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,306
BUT IS EXHAUSTED.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,184
AND I, TOO,
AM LOOKING FORWARD

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,189
TO A NICE PERIOD OF REST
ON SOME LOVELY PLANET.

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,148
CAPTAIN.

8
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,651
THERE WAS A MESSAGE
FROM STARBASE 6.

9
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,069
HEAVY INTERFERENCE.
ALL I GET IS<i> INTREPID</i>

10
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,072
AND WHAT SOUNDED LIKE
A SECTOR COORDINATE.

11
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:31,866
INTERESTING.

12
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:34,535
NO INDICATIONS OF MAGNETIC
STORMS IN THIS SECTOR.

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,953
TRY ANOTHER CHANNEL,
LIEUTENANT.

14
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,663
AYE, SIR.

15
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,540
<i>INTREPID</i> IS MANNED
BY VULCANS,
ISN'T IT?

16
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,332
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

17
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,168
<i>ENTERPRISE</i>
CALLING STARBASE 6.

18
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,212
<i>ENTERPRISE</i>
CALLING STARBASE 6.

19
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,588
COME IN. COME IN.

20
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:47,882
SPOCK?

21
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,218
WHAT IS IT, SPOCK?
ARE YOU IN PAIN?

22
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,135
CAPTAIN...

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,763
THE<i> INTREPID...</i>

24
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:58,058
IT JUST...DIED.

25
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,188
AND THE 400 VULCANS
ABOARD...

26
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,524
ALL DEAD.

27
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:09,028
COME ON, SPOCK.
LET'S GO DOWN TO SICK BAY.

28
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,531
DOCTOR, I KNOW WHAT I KNOW.

29
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,991
GET TO THE
SICK BAY.

30
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,284
CAPTAIN...

31
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,662
NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S AN ORDER.

32
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,206
YES, SIR.

33
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,095
CAPTAIN, I HAVE
STARBASE 6 READABLE NOW.

34
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,432
SWITCHING TO AUDIO, SIR.

35
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,268
KIRK HERE. GO AHEAD.

36
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,563
<i>WILL DIVERT</i>
<i>IMMEDIATELY</i>
<i>TO SECTOR 39J.</i>

37
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:49,693
SIR, THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
JUST COMPLETED
AN EXHAUSTING MISSION.

38
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,361
WE'RE ON OUR WAY IN
FOR R AND R.

39
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,948
THERE MUST BE
ANOTHER STARSHIP
IN THAT SECTOR.

40
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:58,201
<i>NEGATIVE. THIS IS</i>
<i>A RESCUE PRIORITY.</i>

41
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,621
<i>WE'VE LOST ALL CONTACT</i>
<i>WITH SOLAR SYSTEM GAMMA 7A,</i>

42
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,206
<i>WHICH THE</i> INTREPID
<i>WAS INVESTIGATING,</i>

43
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,167
<i>AND WE'VE JUST LOST CONTACT</i>
<i>WITH THE</i> INTREPID.

44
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,294
<i>REPORT PROGRESS.</i>

45
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,631
ORDER ACKNOWLEDGED.
KIRK OUT.

46
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,177
MR. KYLE,
YOU HEARD THE ORDER.

47
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,221
SET A COURSE FOR GAMMA 7A,
WARP 5.

48
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,347
AYE, SIR.

49
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,142
CAPTAIN...
I HAVE JUST COMPLETED

50
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,729
A FULL LONG-RANGE SCAN
OF GAMMA 7A SYSTEM.

51
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,897
IT IS DEAD.

52
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,607
DEAD?

53
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,154
THAT WAS
A FOURTH MAGNITUDE SUN.

54
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,532
THERE ARE BILLIONS
OF INHABITANTS THERE.

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,535
IT IS DEAD.

56
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,593
Captain Kirk:<i> SPACE--</i>
<i>THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

57
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:06,227
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE.

58
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,105
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

59
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,691
<i>TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>STRANGE NEW WORLDS...</i>

60
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:14,653
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...</i>

61
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:57,445
<i>TO BOLDLY GO WHERE</i>
<i>NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.</i>

62
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,534
I ASSURE YOU, DOCTOR,
I'M QUITE ALL RIGHT.

63
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,537
THE PAIN WAS MOMENTARY.
IT PASSED QUICKLY.

64
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,623
ALL OF MY INSTRUMENTS
SEEM TO AGREE WITH YOU,

65
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,169
IF I CAN TRUST THESE
CRAZY VULCAN READINGS.

66
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:18,759
SPOCK, HOW CAN YOU
BE SO SURE THE<i> INTREPID</i>
WAS DESTROYED?

67
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,011
I SENSED IT DIE.

68
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,429
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
HAD TO BE IN
PHYSICAL CONTACT

69
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,346
WITH A SUBJECT
BEFORE--

70
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,058
DOCTOR, EVEN I,
A HALF VULCAN,

71
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,061
COULD HEAR THE DEATH SCREAM
OF 400 VULCAN MINDS

72
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,106
CRYING OUT OVER
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US.

73
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,942
NOT EVEN A VULCAN
COULD FEEL
A STARSHIP DIE.

74
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,568
CALL IT
A DEEP UNDERSTANDING

75
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,278
OF THE WAY THINGS
HAPPEN TO VULCANS,

76
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,989
BUT I KNOW
THAT NOT A PERSON,

77
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,408
NOT EVEN THE COMPUTERS
ON BOARD THE<i> INTREPID,</i>

78
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,035
KNEW WHAT
WAS KILLING THEM

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,828
OR WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT
HAD THEY KNOWN.

80
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,289
BUT 400 VULCANS.

81
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,416
I'VE NOTICED THAT
ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE,
DOCTOR.

82
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,170
YOU FIND IT EASIER
TO UNDERSTAND
THE DEATH OF ONE

83
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,756
THAN THE DEATH
OF A MILLION.

84
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,675
YOU SPEAK ABOUT
THE OBJECTIVE HARDNESS
OF THE VULCAN HEART,

85
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:06,056
YET HOW LITTLE ROOM
THERE SEEMS TO BE IN YOURS.

86
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,895
SUFFER THE DEATH
OF THY NEIGHBOR, EH, SPOCK?

87
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,648
YOU WOULDN'T WISH THAT
ON US, WOULD YOU?

88
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:19,319
IT MIGHT HAVE RENDERED
YOUR HISTORY
A BIT LESS BLOODY.

89
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,873
SPOCK, YOU MAY
HAVE BEEN RIGHT.

90
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,959
WE'VE JUST LOST CONTACT
WITH THE<i> INTREPID</i>

91
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,086
AND ARE OUT OF COMMUNICATION
WITH AN ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM.

92
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,754
ANY UPDATE FROM STARFLEET?

93
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,007
I CANNOT FILTER OUT
THE DISTORTION, SIR.

94
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,675
IT'S GETTING WORSE.

95
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,011
CAPTAIN, DEFLECTOR SHIELDS
JUST SNAPPED ON.

96
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,096
SLOW TO WARP 3.

97
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,931
WARP 3, SIR.

98
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,102
INDICATIONS OF ENERGY
TURBULENCE AHEAD.

99
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,604
UNABLE TO ANALYZE.

100
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,607
I'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED
READINGS LIKE THIS BEFORE.

101
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,988
SCANNERS ON.

102
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,368
MAGNIFICATION 3
ON THE SCREEN.

103
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,621
MAGNIFICATION
FACTOR 3, SIR.

104
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,085
EXACTLY WHAT ARE WE
LOOKING FOR, MR. SPOCK?

105
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,254
I WOULD ASSUME...

106
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,881
THAT.

107
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,231
WHAT IS THAT?

108
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:41,151
PERHAPS AN INTERSTELLAR
DUST CLOUD.

109
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,028
NOT VERY LIKELY, ENSIGN.

110
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:47,615
NO. YOU WOULD
BE ABLE TO SEE STARS
THROUGH A DUST CLOUD.

111
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,535
LOOKS LIKE
A HOLE IN SPACE.

112
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,037
READINGS, MR. SPOCK.

113
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,705
STILL NOT ABLE TO ANALYZE,
CAPTAIN.

114
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,084
SENSORS ARE FEEDING DATA
TO THE COMPUTERS NOW.

115
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,793
WHATEVER THIS DARK ZONE IS,

116
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,505
IT LIES DIRECTLY IN LINE
WITH THE COURSE I CALCULATE

117
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,633
FOR THE<i> INTREPID</i>
AND THE GAMMA 7A SYSTEM.

118
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,474
HOLD PRESENT COURSE.

119
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,935
SLOW TO WARP 1.

120
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,104
WARP FACTOR 1, SIR.

121
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,356
MR. CHEKOV, PREPARE
TO LAUNCH TELEMETRY PROBE
INTO THAT ZONE.

122
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,649
DIRECT COMPUTER FEED
TO MR. SPOCK.

123
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,651
AYE, SIR. PROBE READY.

124
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,154
SWITCHING DATA FEED
TO LIBRARY COMPUTER.

125
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,155
LAUNCH PROBE.

126
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,324
PROBE LAUNCHED, SIR.

127
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:39,667
[HIGH-PITCHED TONE]

128
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,253
WHAT WAS THAT?

129
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,588
THE TELEMETRY PROBE,
SIR.

130
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,133
THERE'S NO SIGNAL
FROM IT NOW.

131
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,051
SPECULATION, SPOCK.

132
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,470
I HAVE NONE, CAPTAIN.
INSUFFICIENT DATA.

133
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,930
[GROAN]

134
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:54,891
OHH!

135
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:55,809
LIEUTENANT.

136
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,060
I'M JUST DIZZY.

137
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,020
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

138
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,563
I'M FINE, SIR.

139
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,150
SICK BAY
TO CAPTAIN KIRK.
McCOY HERE.

140
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,943
KIRK HERE.
WHAT IS IT?

141
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,653
I'M GETTING REPORTS
FROM EVERY DECK.

142
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,572
HALF THE PEOPLE
ON THIS SHIP
JUST FAINTED.

143
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,075
UHURA ALMOST DID.
SHE SAYS SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

144
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,576
YOU WANT TO SEE HER?

145
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,869
NOT UNLESS
SHE'S FEELING ILL.

146
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:15,954
I'VE GOT AN
EMERGENCY DOWN HERE.

147
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,414
WHAT'S WRONG?

148
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,082
WELL, THERE'S
NOTHING ORGANIC.

149
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,085
THEY ALL SEEM
TO BE NERVOUS, WEAK,
AND IRRITABLE.

150
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,544
THEY SAY IT HAPPENED
SUDDENLY, LIKE A
BALLOON POPPING.

151
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,796
CAN YOU HANDLE IT, BONES?

152
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,506
I'M GIVING THEM
STIMULANTS

153
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,508
TO KEEP THEM
ON THEIR FEET.

154
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,926
YEAH, WE CAN HANDLE
IT, JIM.

155
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,761
GOOD. KIRK OUT.

156
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,152
HOLD OUR POSITION,
MR. KYLE.

157
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,528
AYE, AYE, SIR.

158
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,699
SPOCK, GIVE ME AN UPDATE
ON THE DARK AREA AHEAD.

159
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,869
NO ANALYSIS DUE TO
INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION.

160
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,288
NO SPECULATION,
NO INFORMATION,
NOTHING.

161
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,499
I'VE ASKED YOU 3 TIMES
FOR INFORMATION
ON THAT THING,

162
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,334
AND YOU'VE BEEN UNABLE
TO SUPPLY IT.

163
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,461
"INSUFFICIENT DATA"
IS NOT SUFFICIENT,
MR. SPOCK.

164
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,920
YOU'RE
THE SCIENCE OFFICER.

165
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,339
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE SUFFICIENT DATA
ALL THE TIME.

166
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,424
I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT,
CAPTAIN,

167
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,843
BUT THE COMPUTERS CONTAIN
NOTHING ON THIS PHENOMENON.

168
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,054
IT IS BEYOND OUR EXPERIENCE,

169
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,473
AND THE NEW INFORMATION
IS NOT YET SIGNIFICANT.

170
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,559
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M TIRED.

171
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,023
IF YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT IT IS,

172
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,775
LET'S USE REVERSE LOGIC.

173
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,819
PERHAPS IT'LL HELP
IF YOU TELL ME
WHAT IT ISN'T.

174
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,532
IT IS NOT LIQUID,
GASEOUS, OR SOLID,

175
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,450
DESPITE THE FACT
WE CANNOT SEE THROUGH IT.

176
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,536
SO FAR THAT'S NOT
MUCH HELP.

177
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,248
IT IS NOT A GALACTIC NEBULA
SUCH AS THE COAL SACK,

178
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,875
AND SINCE OUR DEFLECTORS
WERE ACTIVATED BY IT,

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,253
IT WOULD SEEM TO BE
SOME FORM OF ENERGY,

180
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,838
BUT NOTHING OUR SENSORS
CAN IDENTIFY.

181
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,925
IS IT POSSIBLE...

182
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,346
THAT THIS IS WHAT
KILLED THAT SOLAR SYSTEM

183
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,098
AND THE<i> INTREPID?</i>

184
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,058
VERY POSSIBLE.

185
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,359
LIEUTENANT.

186
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,693
YES, SIR.

187
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,821
NOTIFY THE STARFLEET...

188
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,700
THAT WE'RE GOING
TO ATTEMPT TO PROBE

189
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,036
THE AREA OF DARKNESS
TO GAIN FURTHER INFORMATION.

190
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,205
AYE, AYE, SIR.

191
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,126
CAPTAIN?

192
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,215
DISTANCE FROM ZONE
OF DARKNESS, MR. KYLE?

193
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,717
100,000 KILOMETERS, SIR.

194
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,010
AHEAD SLOW.

195
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,011
IMPULSE POWER OFF.

196
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,930
AYE, AYE, SIR.

197
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,686
TRANSMISSION TO STARFLEET
COMPLETE, SIR.

198
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,605
VERY GOOD.

199
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,153
TIME, MR. CHEKOV.

200
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,740
PENETRATION OF THE ZONE
IN ONE MINUTE,
SEVEN SECONDS, SIR.

201
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,621
RED ALERT.

202
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,081
DEFLECTORS FULL POWER.

203
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,000
PHASER BANKS READY.

204
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,961
PHASERS STANDING BY.

205
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,005
DEFLECTORS
AT FULL POWER, SIR.

206
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,511
[HIGH-PITCHED TONE]

207
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,013
IT'S NOT COMING
FROM COMMUNICATIONS, SIR.

208
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,598
SPOCK!

209
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,558
ANALYZING NOW, CAPTAIN.

210
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,692
CAPTAIN...

211
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,694
THE STARS...

212
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,071
ARE GONE!

213
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,080
MALFUNCTION, MR. SPOCK?

214
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,957
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.

215
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,709
ALL SYSTEMS
FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.

216
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,463
THEN KINDLY TELL
ME WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE STARS.

217
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,217
UNKNOWN, CAPTAIN.

218
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,386
KIRK TO McCOY.

219
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,470
McCOY HERE.

220
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,596
THINGS ANY BETTER
DOWN THERE?

221
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,599
WORSE. THEY'RE BACKED
UP INTO THE CORRIDOR.

222
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,143
HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING
THAT WILL HELP UP HERE?

223
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:11,772
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
FOLDING ON THE BRIDGE
AT A CRITICAL MOMENT.

224
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,983
ON MY WAY.
McCOY OUT.

225
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,569
KIRK TO ENGINEERING.

226
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,987
SCOTTY, THERE
WAS A POWER LOSS.

227
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,447
HOW COME?

228
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,449
WE LOST 5% OF OUR
ENERGY RESERVE, SIR.

229
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,577
OUR DEFLECTOR SHIELDS
ARE WEAKENED.

230
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,495
CAN YOU COMPENSATE
FOR THE LOSS?

231
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,497
AYE, IF WE
DON'T LOSE ANY MORE.

232
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,457
DON'T ASK ME
HOW IT HAPPENED.

233
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,585
I AM ASKING HOW, MISTER.

234
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,211
I WANT ANSWERS.
KIRK OUT.

235
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,800
WHAT'S THAT?

236
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,219
A STIMULANT.

237
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,973
BONES, HOW BAD IS IT?

238
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,310
2/3 OF THE PERSONNEL
ARE AFFECTED.

239
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,942
WHY? HOW?

240
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,111
DO YOU HAVE
ANY ANSWERS?

241
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,114
YOU KNOW YOU'LL GET
EVERYTHING I CAN TELL YOU.

242
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,825
BUT WHEN THERE IS NOTHING,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

243
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,959
NURSE.

244
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,922
THIS SHIP
IS IN TROUBLE.

245
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,216
WE'D BETTER START
SOLVING PROBLEMS
FASTER

246
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,469
THAN WE PICK UP
NEW ONES.

247
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:26,723
WE SEEM TO BE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A
CREEPING PARALYSIS.

248
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,605
MR. SPOCK, ANALYSIS
OF THAT LAST BURST
OF NOISE

249
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,315
BEFORE WE STARTED
LOSING POWER.

250
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,150
THAT SOUND
WAS THE TURBULENCE

251
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,402
CAUSED BY THE PENETRATION
OF A BOUNDARY LAYER,
CAPTAIN.

252
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,570
WHAT BOUNDARY LAYER?

253
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,280
UNKNOWN.

254
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,699
BOUNDARY LAYER
BETWEEN WHAT AND WHAT?

255
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,452
BETWEEN WHERE WE WERE
AND WHERE WE ARE.

256
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,079
ARE YOU TRYING TO
BE FUNNY, MR. SPOCK?

257
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,666
IT WOULD NEVER OCCUR
TO ME, CAPTAIN.

258
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,087
DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEAS, SPOCK?

259
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,175
WE STILL HAVE NO SPECIFICS,
BUT WE SEEM TO HAVE ENTERED
A ZONE OF ENERGY

260
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,470
WHICH IS INCOMPATIBLE
WITH OUR LIVING
AND MECHANICAL PROCESSES.

261
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,764
AS WE DRAW CLOSER
TO THE SOURCE,

262
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,350
IT GROWS STRONGER
AND WE GROW WEAKER.

263
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,143
RECOMMENDATIONS.

264
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,852
I HAVE ONE.

265
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,940
I RECOMMEND SURVIVAL.

266
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,696
LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE.

267
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,798
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

268
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,466
WE'RE ON
A DIFFICULT MISSION,

269
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,177
BUT IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.

270
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,430
OUR ORDERS DO NOT SAY
"STAY ALIVE" OR "RETREAT."

271
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,265
OUR MISSION
IS TO INVESTIGATE.

272
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,395
WE'RE SICK,
AND WE'RE GETTING SICKER.

273
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,523
WE HAVE NO GUARANTEES,
BUT WE HAVE A GOOD SHIP

274
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,359
AND THE BEST CREW
IN THE STARFLEET,

275
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,778
SO DO YOUR JOBS.
CARRY ON.

276
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,654
KIRK OUT.

277
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,953
SICK BAY
TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

278
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,539
KIRK HERE.
GO AHEAD, BONES.

279
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:18,167
JIM, ACCORDING
TO THE LIFE INDICATORS,
THE ENERGY LEVELS...

280
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,960
YES, SAY IT, BONES.

281
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,339
ACCORDING TO
THE LIFE MONITORS,
WE'RE DYING.

282
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,008
WE'RE ALL DYING.

285
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,190
<i>SINCE WE ENTERED</i>

286
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,734

287
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,736

[CRASH]

290
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,617
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

291
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,034
WHAT WAS THAT?

292
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,286
I'M SORRY, SIR.
I'M NOT SURE.

293
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,204
I WAS TRYING
TO RECALIBRATE,

294
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,831
AND WE WENT
INTO REVERSE.

295
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,541
REVERSE?
THAT WAS A FORWARD LURCH.

296
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,461
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN
IN REVERSE THRUST?

297
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,962
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

298
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,964
ALL I KNOW IS THAT...

299
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,925
THE POWER LEVELS

300
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,469
ARE DOWN 12%
AND STEADILY DECREASING.

301
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,930
I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

WE ARE ACCELERATING.

305
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,230
WE ARE BEING PULLED
TOWARD THE CENTER OF
THE ZONE OF DARKNESS.

306
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,816
BY WHAT, SPOCK?

307
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,233
UNKNOWN, CAPTAIN.
I SUGGEST YOU ORDER
MR. SCOTT

308
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,320
TO GIVE US
REVERSE POWER.

309
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,280
HE JUST GAVE US
REVERSE POWER.

310
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,197
WE LURCHED FORWARD.

311
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,116
IN THAT CASE, CAPTAIN,

312
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,036
I WOULD SUGGEST
WE APPLY FORWARD THRUST.

313
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,540
DOCTOR.

314
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,460
LIFE FUNCTION
INDICATORS.

315
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,044
THEY'VE STARTED
TO DROP AGAIN.

316
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,174
STIMULANTS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
WE CAN KEEP THIS UP.

317
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,639
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
SCOTTY?
FORWARD THRUST?

318
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,307
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

319
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,225
IT GOES AGAINST
THE RULES OF LOGIC.

320
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,186
YES, IT DOES,
DOESN'T IT?

321
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,648
IF IT DOESN'T WORK,
I'LL NEVER LET SPOCK
LIVE IT DOWN.

322
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,858
NUDGE IT FORWARD.

323
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:05,942
BUT...

324
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,151
GO AHEAD.

325
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,746
THAT'S DOING IT, SIR.
WE'RE SLOWING DOWN.

326
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,331
BUT WE'RE NOT STOPPING.

327
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,333
WE'RE STILL BEING
DRAGGED FORWARD.

328
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,584
HAVE ONE OF YOUR
ENGINEERS MONITOR
THE INSTRUMENTS.

329
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,170
KEEP APPLYING THRUST
AGAINST THE PULL.

330
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,924
DOCTOR, THEY SEEM
TO BE STABILIZING.

331
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,802
BUT AT A DANGEROUSLY
LOW LEVEL.

332
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,471
WELL,
WE'RE STILL ALIVE.

333
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,182
I SUPPOSE
THAT'S SOMETHING.

334
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,692
ALL I CAN ATTRIBUTE IS,
THE FURTHER WE TRAVEL
INTO THIS ZONE OF DARKNESS,

335
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,193
THE WEAKER OUR
LIFE FUNCTIONS BECOME,

336
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,321
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

337
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,702
I'M ALL RIGHT.
IT'S THOSE STIMULANTS.

338
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,412
THEY CATCH UP WITH YOU.

339
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,330
ENGINEERING.

340
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,291
AS FAR AS THE POWER LEVELS
ARE CONCERNED, EVERYTHING
IS ACTING BACKWARDS,

341
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,836
BUT THE DRAIN IS CONTINUING.

342
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,756
ON THE STATIC TESTS,
I COULD ONLY GET 60% POWER.

343
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,298
WE'RE STILL BEING
DRAGGED FORWARD.

344
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,967

345
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,220
IT'S LOGICAL TO ASSUME
THAT SOMETHING
WITHIN THIS ZONE

346
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,847
ABSORBS ALL FORMS
OF ENERGY

347
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,599
WHETHER MECHANICALLY OR
BIOLOGICALLY PRODUCED.

348
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,227
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT WOULD SEEM TO BE
THE SAME THING

349
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,064
WHICH DREW ALL
THE ENERGY OUT OF
AN ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM

350
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,899
AND THE<i> INTREPID.</i>

351
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,609
THE SAME THING,
NOT THE ZONE ITSELF?

352
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,193
I WOULD SAY NOT,
CAPTAIN.

353
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:35,615
THE ANALYSIS OF THE ZONE
INDICATES IT IS
A NEGATIVE ENERGY FIELD,

354
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,657
HOWEVER ILLOGICAL
THAT MAY SOUND,

355
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,619
BUT IT IS NOT THE SOURCE
OF THE POWER DRAIN.

356
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,080
MAYBE IT'S A SHIELD
OF SOME KIND,

357
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,248
SOME FORM OF PROTECTION
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

358
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,750
BUT WHAT?

359
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,585
WE'LL FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS,

360
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,088
BUT WE BETTER GET OUT
OF HERE OURSELVES.

361
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:54,508
SCOTTY, CHANNEL
ALL THE IMPULSE
AND WARP POWER

362
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,551
INTO ONE MASSIVE
THRUST FORWARD.

363
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,429
THAT MIGHT SNAP US
OUT OF THE ZONE.

364
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,681
AYE, CAPTAIN, BUT I'LL RESERVE
SOME FOR THE SHIELDS,

365
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,558
JUST IN CASE
WE DON'T GET OUT.

366
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,603
I SUBMIT, MR. SCOTT,
THAT IF WE DO NOT
GET OUT,

367
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,604
THE SHIELDS
WOULD BE EXTRANEOUS.

368
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,565
IT WOULD ONLY PROLONG
OUR WAIT FOR DEATH

369
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,025
BY A SHORT PERIOD
OF TIME.

370
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,114
USE WHATEVER POWER
IS NECESSARY TO GET US
OUT OF HERE, SCOTTY.

371
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,909
REPORT TO YOUR STATIONS,
CONTINUE YOUR RESEARCH.

372
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,702
DISMISSED.

373
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:34,048
CAPTAIN, THE<i> INTREPID</i>
WOULD'VE DONE ALL
THESE THINGS, TOO,

374
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,925
AND YET,
THEY WERE DESTROYED.

375
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,886
WELL, THEY MAY NOT
HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS.

376
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:43,390
YOU'VE JUST POINTED OUT
HOW ILLOGICAL
THIS SITUATION IS.

377
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,892
TRUE.

378
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,855
IT IS ALSO TRUE
THEY NEVER KNEW
WHAT WAS KILLING THEM.

379
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,190
THEIR LOGIC WOULD NOT
HAVE PERMITTED THEM

380
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,526
TO BELIEVE
THEY WERE BEING KILLED.

381
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,234
EXPLAIN.

382
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,236
VULCAN HAS NOT
BEEN CONQUERED

383
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,114
WITHIN ITS
COLLECTIVE MEMORY.

384
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,740
THE MEMORY GOES BACK
SO FAR

385
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,743
THAT NO VULCAN
CAN CONCEIVE
OF A CONQUEROR.

386
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,997
I KNEW THE SHIP WAS LOST
BECAUSE I SENSED IT.

387
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,414
WHAT WAS IT YOU SENSED?

388
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,375
A TOUCH OF DEATH.

389
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,671
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY FELT?

390
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,050
ASTONISHMENT.

391
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,447
AYE, THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

392
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,577
ENGINEERING
TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

393
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,871
KIRK HERE.
WHAT IS IT, SCOTTY?

394
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,539
READY TO TRY IT WHEN
YOU ARE, SIR.

395
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,959
DO WE HAVE THE POWER
TO PULL IT OFF, SCOTTY?

396
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,335
I HOPE SO, CAPTAIN.

397
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,795
STAND BY.

398
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,883
ALL HANDS,
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

399
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,343
WE ARE SLOWLY
BEING PULLED DEEPER

400
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,055
INTO THE ZONE OF DARKNESS
BY AN UNKNOWN FORCE.

401
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,684
WE'RE GOING TO APPLY
ALL AVAILABLE POWER

402
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,770
INTO ONE GIANT
FORWARD THRUST

403
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:15,149
IN THE HOPE THAT IT WILL
YANK US OUT OF THE ZONE.

404
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,568
PREPARE YOURSELVES.

405
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,616
ALL RIGHT, SCOTTY.
LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

406
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:50,810
SCOTTY!

407
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,478
IT'S NO GOOD, SIR.

408
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,354
THE BEST WE CAN DO
IS TO MAINTAIN THRUST
AGAINST THE PULL

409
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,731
AND HOLD OUR POSITION.

410
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,275
ARE WE STILL
LOSING POWER?

411
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,234
AYE, SIR.

412
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,736
HOW LONG WILL
THE POWER HOLD OUT?

413
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,905
AT THIS RATE,
PLUS THE DRAIN
ON ALL SYSTEMS,

414
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,323
TWO HOURS, SIR.

415
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,616
MAINTAIN THRUST, SCOTTY.

416
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,455
WHILE WE'RE MAINTAINING
OUR DISTANCE, MR. SPOCK,

417
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,374
HAVE YOU ASCERTAINED YET
WHAT WE'RE MAINTAINING
OUR DISTANCE FROM?

418
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,418
I CANNOT SAY WHAT IT IS,
CAPTAIN,

419
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:21,007
BUT I WOULD SAY
IT HAS FOUND US.

420
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,862
PREPARE TO LAUNCH
A PROBE, MR. CHEKOV.

421
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,238
AYE, SIR.

422
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,532
PROBE READY FOR LAUNCH,
SIR.

423
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,909
GETTING VERY CONFUSED
READINGS, CAPTAIN,

424
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,205
BUT THIS IS
DEFINITELY THE SOURCE
OF THE ENERGY DRAIN.

425
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,371
LAUNCH PROBE.

426
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,414
PROBE LAUNCHED, SIR.

427
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,795
PROBE WILL IMPACT
IN 7.3 SECONDS.

428
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,713
6...

429
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,923
5...

430
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,591
4...3...

431
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,719
2...1...

432
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,637
[EXPLOSION]

433
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,725
ARE WE STILL IN CONTACT
WITH THE PROBE?

434
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,310
YES, SIR.
DATA BEING RELAYED
TO MR. SPOCK.

435
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,312
READINGS COMING IN NOW,
CAPTAIN.

436
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,857
LENGTH--
APPROXIMATELY 11,000 MILES.

437
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:24,862
WIDTH--VARYING
FROM 2,000 TO 3,000 MILES.

438
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:29,992
OUTER LAYER STUDDED
WITH SPACE DEBRIS

439
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,327
AND WASTE.

440
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:36,290
INTERIOR CONSISTS OF...
PROTOPLASM,

441
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,710
VARYING FROM A FIRMER
GELATINOUS LAYER

442
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,256
TO A SEMIFLUID
CENTRAL MASS.

443
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,842
CONDITION...

444
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,011
LIVING.

445
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,061
MAGNIFICATION 4.

446
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,813
MAGNIFICATION 4, SIR.

447
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,821
THAT IS WHAT IS DRAWING US
TOWARD IT, CAPTAIN,

448
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,575
THE SAME WAY IT DREW THE
<i>INTREPID</i> TO HER DEATH.

449
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,591
THAT IS
AN AMOEBA.

450
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,510
YES, I REMEMBER
MY BASIC BIOLOGY, DOCTOR.

451
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,554
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
THAT THAT THING OUT THERE

452
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,432
IS A GIANT
SINGLE-CELLED ANIMAL?

453
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,434
YES, FOR LACK
OF A BETTER TERM.

454
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,436
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE
FORM OF LIFE.

455
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,477
IN FACT,
IT'S A MUCH SIMPLER
FORM OF LIFE

456
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,148
THAN WHAT YOU'RE
LOOKING AT NOW.

457
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,524
THAT THING OUT THERE
APPARENTLY CAN PERFORM
ALL THE FUNCTIONS

458
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,652
THAT QUALIFY IT AS
A LIVING ORGANISM.

459
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:50,488
IT CAN REPRODUCE,
IT CAN BREATHE,
IT CAN EAT,

460
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,950
ALTHOUGH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

461
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,202
ENERGY ITSELF, PERHAPS,
DRAINED FROM US.

462
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,746
I WOULD SPECULATE THAT
THIS UNKNOWN LIFE FORM

463
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,666
IS INVADING OUR GALAXY
LIKE A VIRUS.

464
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:06,255
THE<i> INTREPID</i> DIED
OF THAT PARTICULAR VIRUS.

465
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,506
HOW IS IT WE SURVIVE?

466
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,717
THE<i> INTREPID</i> MUST HAVE
COME ACROSS THE ORGANISM

467
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,054
WHILE IT WAS
STILL LOW IN ENERGY,
STILL HUNGRY.

468
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,764
WE ARE NOT SAFE,
CAPTAIN.

469
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,351
WE MERELY HAVE
A LITTLE MORE TIME
THAN THE<i> INTREPID</i> DID.

470
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:21,354
WHAT ABOUT THIS
ZONE OF DARKNESS?

471
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,897
DOES THE ORGANISM
GENERATE IT ITSELF

472
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,899
AS A FORM
OF PROTECTION?

473
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,194
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT.

474
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,778
GOT TO TAKE A CLOSER
LOOK AT IT.

475
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,614
THE CLOSER WE GET,
THE FASTER OUR
ENERGY DRAINS OUT.

476
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,242
WE'RE BARELY SURVIVING
AT THIS DISTANCE.

477
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,995
PERHAPS WE COULD
RISK THE SHUTTLECRAFT.

478
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,081
PERHAPS WITH
A PROTECTIVE SHIELD--

479
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,875
I'M NOT SENDING
ANYONE ANYWHERE.

480
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,794
UNMANNED PROBES CAN GIVE US
THE INFORMATION WE NEED

481
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,172
TO DESTROY THIS THING,
IF IT CAN BE DESTROYED.

482
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,547
I MUST DIFFER WITH YOU,
CAPTAIN.

483
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,426
WE HAVE SENT UNMANNED
PROBES INTO IT.

484
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,635
THEY'VE GIVEN US
SOME INFORMATION

485
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,722
BUT THEY'VE NOT TOLD US
WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW.

486
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,015
WE CANNOT AFFORD THE POWER
TO TAKE BLIND SHOTS AT IT,

487
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,892
HOPING TO KILL IT.

488
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:03,645
WE COULD SEND
ONE MAN IN, PINPOINT
ITS VULNERABLE SPOTS.

489
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,439
YOU KNOW WHAT THE ODDS
ARE IN COMING BACK?

490
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,606
I CAN'T ORDER
A MAN TO DO THAT.

491
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,526
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT AN ORDER, JIM?

492
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,567
YOU'VE
GOT A VOLUNTEER.

493
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,569
I'VE ALREADY
DONE THE
PRELIMINARY WORK.

494
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,988
IT'S A SUICIDE MISSION.

495
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,407
THE THING EVIDENTLY
HAS REFLEXES.

496
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,909
THE UNMANNED PROBE
WE SENT INTO IT

497
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,494
MUST HAVE STUNG
IT WHEN IT ENTERED.

498
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,163
THE LURCH WE FELT
WAS THE TURBULENCE
OF ITS REACTION.

499
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,874
ALL RIGHT,
SO I'D KNOW
ENOUGH TO GO SLOW

500
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,085
WHEN WE
PENETRATED ITS
VULNERABLE SPOTS.

501
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,087
YOU HAVE A MARTYR
COMPLEX, DOCTOR.

502
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,256
I SUBMIT THAT IT
DISQUALIFIES YOU.

503
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,760
DO YOU THINK

504
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,930
THAT I INTEND TO PASS UP
THE GREATEST LIVING
LABORATORY SINCE--

505
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:41,350
THE VULCANS
SAW IT FIRST AND DIED.

506
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,352
JUST BECAUSE
THE VULCANS FAILED--

507
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,354
I AM MORE CAPABLE.

508
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,857
GENTLEMEN, I AM NOT
TAKING VOLUNTEERS.

509
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,568
YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

510
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,652
I'M BETTER QUALIFIED
AS A COMMAND PILOT
THAN YOU ARE.

511
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,654
WHICH MAKES YOU
INDISPENSABLE, CAPTAIN.

512
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,201
FURTHER, YOU ARE NOT
A SCIENCE SPECIALIST.

513
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,828
JIM, THAT ORGANISM
CONTAINS CHEMICAL
PROCESSES

514
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,415
WE'VE NEVER
SEEN BEFORE AND
MAY NEVER SEE AGAIN.

515
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,833
WE COULD LEARN MORE
IN ONE DAY--

516
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,502
WE DON'T HAVE
ONE DAY, DOCTOR.

517
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:12,756
WE HAVE PRECISELY
1 HOUR AND 35 MINUTES
OF POWER LEFT.

518
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,757
JIM--

519
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:14,632
CAPTAIN, I--

520
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,803
GENTLEMEN,
I'LL DECIDE.

521
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,893
CAPTAIN'S PERSONAL LOG--

522
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,854
STARDATE 4309.2.

523
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,855
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED

524
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,485
THAT THE THING
WHICH DESTROYED
THE<i> U.S.S. INTREPID</i>

525
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,445
AND THE GAMMA 7A SYSTEM

526
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,031
IS AN INCREDIBLY HUGE
BUT SIMPLE CELLULAR BEING

527
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,826
WHOSE ENERGIES ARE
TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE
TO ALL KNOWN LIFE.

528
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:44,037
BOTH MR. SPOCK
AND DR. McCOY

529
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,665
HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO GO
IN A SPECIALLY EQUIPPED
SHUTTLECRAFT

530
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,085
TO PENETRATE THE CELL,
FIND A WAY TO DESTROY IT,

531
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,296
AND FREE THE SHIP.

532
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,802
DR. McCOY HAS THE
MEDICAL-BIOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE.

533
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,055
MR. SPOCK...

534
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:06,560
IS BETTER SUITED
PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY
TO STAND THE STRESS.

535
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,064
BOTH ARE RIGHT,

536
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,275
BOTH ARE CAPABLE...

537
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,071
AND WHICH OF MY FRIENDS

538
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,698
DO I CONDEMN TO DEATH?

539
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,460
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

540
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:36,465
MR. SPOCK, DR. McCOY,
REPORT TO MY QUARTERS
IMMEDIATELY.

541
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,425
KIRK OUT.

542
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:39,843

TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

543
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,428
KIRK HERE.

544
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:45,098
YOU ASKED ME
TO KEEP YOU INFORMED
ON THE POWER DRAIN, SIR.

545
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,352
ALL LEVELS
ARE DOWN 50% NOW

546
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,145
AND STILL DRAINING.

547
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,940
WE CAN MAINTAIN
THRUST FOR ANOTHER
HOUR AND 15 MINUTES.

548
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,401
VERY WELL.

549
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,236
PREPARE THE SHUTTLECRAFT
FOR LAUNCHING.

550
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,571
SIR?

551
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,950
DR. McCOY WILL
TELL YOU WHAT SPECIAL
EQUIPMENT TO PUT IN IT.

552
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,369
KIRK OUT.

553
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,789
I'M SORRY,
MR. SPOCK.

554
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,086
RIGHT. I'LL
GET A FEW THINGS
I NEED, JIM.

555
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,546
NOT YOU, BONES.

556
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,548
I'M SORRY,
MR. SPOCK.

557
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,551
YOU'RE BEST
QUALIFIED TO GO.

558
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,104
DO NOT SUFFER SO,
DOCTOR.

559
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,398
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST
TIME SUPERIOR CAPABILITY

560
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:38,235
HAS PROVEN MORE VALUABLE
THAN PROFESSIONAL
CREDENTIALS.

561
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,279
NOTHING HAS BEEN
PROVEN YET, SPOCK.

562
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,821
THE DNA CODE ANALYZER

563
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,324
WILL GIVE YOU THE
FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURE
OF THE THING.

564
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,826
YOU'LL NEED READINGS ON
THREE LIGHT WAVELENGTHS

565
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,245
FROM THE ENZYME RECORDER.

566
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,830
I AM FAMILIAR WITH
THE EQUIPMENT, DOCTOR.

567
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,126
WE'RE WASTING TIME.
THE SHUTTLECRAFT
IS READY.

568
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,713
YOU'RE DETERMINED NOT
TO LET ME SHARE IN THIS,
AREN'T YOU?

569
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,298
THIS IS NOT
A COMPETITION, DOCTOR.

570
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,300
WHETHER YOU
UNDERSTAND IT OR NOT,

571
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,885
GRANT ME MY
OWN KIND OF DIGNITY.

572
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,971
VULCAN DIGNITY?

573
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,557
HOW CAN I GRANT YOU
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND?

574
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,644
THEN EMPLOY ONE OF
YOUR OWN SUPERSTITIONS.

575
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,937
WISH ME LUCK.

576
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,552
GOOD LUCK, SPOCK.

577
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,726
ALL SYSTEMS CLEAR FOR
SHUTTLECRAFT LAUNCH,
SIR.

578
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,687

CHEKOV.

00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,890

HE WON'T HAVE
ENOUGH POWER
TO GET BACK OUT

591
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,193
IF HE DIVERTS IT
TO HIS SHIELDS.

592
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,194
SPOCK--

593
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,863
I HEARD, CAPTAIN.

594
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,240
WE DISCUSSED THAT
POSSIBILITY EARLIER.

595
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,242
BUT YOU WILL NEED
THIS INFORMATION.

596
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,951
WHEN DO YOU
ESTIMATE PENETRATION?

597
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,079

BRACE YOURSELVES.

600
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,880
THE AREA

NO DOUBT BE SENSITIVE.

MR. SCOTT

00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:35,245
I HAD
3% POWER RESERVE

STABILIZED.

609
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,416
THERE WAS
NOTHING TO SPARE.

610
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,334
I SHALL
CONTINUE MY TESTS.

611
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,047
OH, AND,
DR. McCOY...

612
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,176
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE
SURVIVED IT.

613
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,804
YOU WANT TO BET?

614
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,724
I AM MOVING SLOWLY NOW,

615
00:32:55,849 --> 00:33:00,771
ESTABLISHING COURSE
TOWARD WHAT APPEARS TO
BE THE NUCLEUS.

616
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:15,994
SIR, MR. SPOCK HAS REDUCED
LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEMS

617
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,371
TO BARE MINIMUM.

618
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,582

SAVE YOUR POWER

00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:28,715
CALCULATIONS INDICATE
THE SHIELDS WILL LAST
ONLY 47 MINUTES.

621
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:36,515
HOWEVER, I AM ABLE TO
IDENTIFY THE CHROMOSOME

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,891

THE ORGANISM

623
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,518

640
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:34,698
HE'S KICKED IT IN
THE SIDE TO LET US KNOW.

641
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:39,327
CAPTAIN, I'M
GETTING TELEMETRY.

642
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,205
MR. CHEKOV, TELEMETRY
ANALYSIS AS IT COMES IN.

643
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,047
ACCORDING TO SPOCK'S
TELEMETRY INFORMATION,

644
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,424
THERE ARE
OVER 40 CHROMOSOMES
IN THE NUCLEUS

645
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,967
THAT ARE READY
TO COME TOGETHER,
READY TO REPRODUCE.

646
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,387
IF THE ENERGY OF THAT
ORGANISM ONLY DOUBLES,
WE'RE DEAD,

647
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,390
AND EVERYTHING WITHIN
A LIGHT YEAR WILL BE
DEFENSELESS.

648
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,392
WELL,
ALL I KNOW IS,

649
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:06,104
THAT SOON THERE'LL BE
TWO, FOUR, EIGHT, AND MORE.

650
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,608
THE ENTIRE ANTILIFE MATTER
THAT THAT THING PUTS OUT

651
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,652

654
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,408
WE MUST DESTROY
THAT ORGANISM.

655
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,078
CAPTAIN, THE PULL
FROM THAT ORGANISM
IS INCREASING,

656
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,289

IS GETTING CRITICAL.

657
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,083
HOW MUCH TIME

00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,500
NO MORE THAN

WISHED ME LUCK.

686
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:51,960
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG--</i>
<i>STARDATE 4309.4.</i>

687
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,963
<i>WE HAVE DETERMINED WE</i>
<i>CAN DESTROY THE CREATURE,</i>

688
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,883
<i>PROVIDED WE CAN DO IT</i>
<i>FROM INSIDE THE ORGANISM.</i>

689
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,886
<i>SPOCK CLEARLY KNEW</i>
<i>HOW TO DESTROY IT</i>

690
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:04,056
<i>BUT WAS UNABLE TO</i>
<i>TRANSMIT THAT INFORMATION.</i>

691
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,432
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

692
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,934
OH...

693
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,435
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

694
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,063
SPOCK.

695
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,064
IS IT ME, JIM?

696
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,440
AM I SO SENTIMENTAL

697
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,317
THAT I JUST HAVE
TO KEEP BELIEVING

698
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,404
THAT HE'S STILL ALIVE IN
THAT MASS OF PROTOPLASM?

699
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,530
HE KNEW THE ODDS
WHEN HE WENT OUT THERE,

700
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:24,034
JUST AS YOU DID WHEN
YOU VOLUNTEERED TO GO.

701
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,374
WHAT IS THAT THING
OUT THERE, BONES?

702
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,876
IT'S NOT INTELLIGENT,

703
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,836
NOT YET.

704
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,880
IT'S A...

705
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,049
DISEASE,

706
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:43,053
LIKE A VIRUS INVADING
THE BODY OF OUR GALAXY.

707
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,434
YES, IT IS, ISN'T IT?

708
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,894
HOW MANY CELLS DOES
A HUMAN BODY HAVE?

709
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,478
MILLIONS.

710
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,857
THIS THING, THIS CELL,
THIS VIRUS--

711
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,817
IT'S 11,000 MILES LONG,

712
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,319
AND IT'S ONE CELL.

713
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,907
WHEN IT
GROWS INTO MILLIONS...

714
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,285
WE'LL BE THE VIRUS
INVADING ITS BODY.

715
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,622
NOW, ISN'T
THAT A THOUGHT?

716
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,793
HERE WE ARE, ANTIBODIES
OF OUR OWN GALAXY,

717
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,503
ATTACKING
AN INVADING GERM.

718
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:22,008
BE IRONIC INDEED IF THAT
WERE OUR SOLE DESTINY,
WOULDN'T IT?

719
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:25,053
ANTIBODIES.

720
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:29,057
ANTIBODIES.

721
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,058
BRIDGE!

722
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,018
SCOTT HERE, SIR.

723
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,979
SCOTTY, HOW MUCH POWER
DO WE HAVE LEFT?

724
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,981
WE'RE DOWN TO 43%, SIR.

725
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:38,858
WE'RE SLIPPING A BIT
AGAINST THE PULL THAT
BEASTIE'S PUTTING ON US.

726
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,987
WE CAN'T LAST MORE
THAN 45 MINUTES AT THIS
RATE OF DECLINE,

727
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,823
LESS IF I HAVE
TO APPLY MORE THRUST.

728
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,365
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

729
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,410
IF YOU DIVERTED
ALL REMAINING POWER
TO THE SHIELDS,

730
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,788
EXCEPT FOR IMPULSE POWER--
KEEP THAT IN RESERVE?

731
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,290
CUT THE ENGINE THRUST?

732
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,000
WE'D BE SUCKED INTO
THAT THING

733
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,709
LIKE BEING CAUGHT
IN A WIND TUNNEL, SIR.

734
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:01,714
EXACTLY. PREPARE
TO DIVERT POWER
ON MY SIGNAL.

735
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,260
KIRK OUT.

736
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,308
YOU GOT
SOMETHING TO SAY?

737
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:11,975
TECHNICALLY, NO.

738
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,559
MEDICALLY, YES.

739
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,395
BETWEEN THE STIMULANTS
AND THE PRESSURE,

740
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,524
I'D SUGGEST YOU TRY
TO STAY OFF YOUR FEET
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

741
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,944
I DON'T HAVE
A FEW MINUTES, BONES.

742
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,779
MAYBE NONE OF US DO.

743
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,740
LET'S GO.

744
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,999
ALL HANDS,
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

745
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:39,502
WE'RE GOING TO ENTER
THE BODY OF THE ORGANISM,

746
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,504
RATHER ABRUPTLY,
I WOULD THINK.

747
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,464
DAMAGE CONTROL
PARTIES STANDBY.

748
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,924
ALL DECKS
SECURE FOR COLLISION.

749
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,052
KIRK OUT.

750
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,268
READY, SCOTTY.

751
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,478
SWITCHING POWER
TO SHIELDS,

752
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,480
IMPULSE
IN RESERVE,

753
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,400
CUTTING THRUST
TO ZERO...

754
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,651
NOW!

755
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,330
IMPACT--
FIVE SECONDS!

756
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,859
WE'RE THROUGH,
SIR.

757
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,570
I BELIEVE EVERYBODY IS
AWARE OF THAT, MR. CHEKOV.

758
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:53,785
DAMAGE CONTROL PARTIES
REPORT MINIMAL DAMAGE, SIR.

759
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,494
REPAIRS ARE
BEING INITIATED.

760
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,871
VERY GOOD, LIEUTENANT.

761
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,458
CAPTAIN, WE'VE ONLY
26% POWER RESERVES
AFTER ENTRY.

762
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,336
DO WE HAVE
IMPULSE POWER, SCOTTY?

763
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,422
I SAVED ALL
I COULD SIR,
BUT I DON'T KNOW

764
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,048
WHETHER WE HAVE
ENOUGH TO GET
BACK OUT AGAIN

765
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,883
OR TIME, EITHER.

766
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,676
WE ARE COMMITTED.

767
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,930
AYE, WE ARE,
BUT WE'RE
COMMITTED TO WHAT?

768
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,932
WE HAVE NO POWER
FOR THE PHASERS.

769
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,017
WE COULDN'T USE IT
IF WE HAD IT.

770
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,519
WE'D COOK OURSELVES
ALONG WITH THAT MESS OF
PROTOPLASM OUT THERE.

771
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,106
THAT THING WOULD
PROBABLY LIKE PHASERS.
IT EATS POWER.

772
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,941
WELL, THEN, WHAT THE
DEVIL--BEGGING YOUR
PARDON, SIR--

773
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,068
ARE WE DOING?

774
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,447
MR. SPOCK WAS TRYING
TO TELL US WHAT TO DO
WHEN WE LOST VOICE CONTACT.

775
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,199
WE CAN'T USE THE POWER
TO DESTROY IT.

776
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:33,741
ANTIPOWER.

777
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,952
WHAT?

778
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,330
THIS THING HAS
A NEGATIVE ENERGY CHARGE.

779
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,290
EVERYTHING SEEMS
TO WORK IN REVERSE.

780
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,667
WE'LL USE ANTIMATTER.

781
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:46,129
AYE, IT COULDN'T
SWALLOW THAT.

782
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,464
MR. CHEKOV,
PREPARE A PROBE.

783
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,424
SCOTTY, WE'LL NEED
A MAGNETIC BOTTLE
FOR THE CHARGE.

784
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,967
HOW SOON?

785
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,510
IT'S ON ITS WAY, SIR.

786
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,595
MR. CHEKOV, WE'LL USE
A TIMING DETONATOR
FOR THE PROBE.

787
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,721
WE'LL WORK OUT A SETTING.

788
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,182
AYE, SIR.

789
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:58,933
HELMSMAN, WHEN DO YOU ESTIMATE
ARRIVE ON THE NUCLEUS?

790
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,268
SEVEN MINUTES,
SIR.

791
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,395
HOW CLOSE ARE YOU
GOING TO IT?

792
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,105
POINT-BLANK RANGE.

793
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,399
WE'LL IMPLANT IT
AND BACK AWAY.

794
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,027
WHY? THE PROBE HAS A
RANGE OF--

795
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,863
WITH THE EDDIES AND
CURRENTS IN THAT PROTOPLASM,

796
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,657
THE PROBE COULD DRIFT
THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS.

797
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,285
WE MUST BE...

798
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,121
EXACTLY ON TARGET,

799
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,500
BECAUSE WE WON'T
HAVE A SECOND CHANCE.

800
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,543
BONES...

801
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:34,386
TIME FOR ANOTHER
STIMULANT.

802
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:36,721
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU
CAN KEEP TAKING THAT STUFF?

803
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,556
IT'LL BLOW YOU APART.

804
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,517
KEEP ME TOGETHER FOR
ANOTHER SEVEN MINUTES.

805
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,559
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

806
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,398
PERSONAL LOG--

807
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,066

<i>U.S.S. ENTERPRISE.</i>

809
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:57,575
I HAVE NOTED THE PASSAGE
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE...</i>

810
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:02,414
ON ITS WAY TO
WHATEVER AWAITS IT.

811
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:07,585
IF THIS RECORD
SHOULD SURVIVE ME...

812
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,838
I WISH IT KNOWN

813
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:15,676
THAT I BEQUEATH MY HIGHEST
COMMENDATION AND TESTIMONIAL

814
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,304

THE FINEST STARSHIP
IN THE FLEET.

818
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,321
WE HAVE ARRIVED
AT THE CHROMOSOME BODY

819
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:39,867
IN THE NUCLEUS
OF THE ORGANISM.

820
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,371
IF WE SHOULD
FAIL IN OUR ATTEMPT
TO DESTROY IT

821
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:47,708
OR BE UNABLE
TO FREE OURSELVES...

822
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:52,255
I WISH TO RECORD

00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,258

PROGRAMMED, SIR.

READY FOR LAUNCH.

833
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,668
MR. SCOTT, HOW MUCH
TIME DO WE HAVE LEFT

834
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,337
AT 100% IMPULSE POWER?

835
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:35,256
SIX, MAYBE
SEVEN MINUTES, SIR.

836
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:41,638
MR. KYLE, PROGRAM FUSE
FOR SEVEN-MINUTE DELAY.

839
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:52,231
CONSERVE
EVERY BIT OF POWER.

840
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:55,443
WE MUST MAKE IT
THROUGH THE MEMBRANE

841
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,986
BEFORE
THAT THING EXPLODES.

842
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,197
MAKE IT WORK, SCOTTY.

843
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,448
AYE, SIR.

844

PROBE CONFIRMED.

852
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,308
IT IS LODGED
IN THE NUCLEUS

853
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,726
NEAR THE CHROMOSOME
BODIES.

854
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:33,105
MR. KYLE, BACK US OUT
THE WAY WE CAME IN.

855

A NICE STRAIGHT LINE.

856
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:38,444
DON'T WASTE ANY TIME.

857
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,154
BACKING OUT,
SIR.

858
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,285
ESTIMATE
WE'LL BE OUT IN...

859
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:49,288
6.37 MINUTES.

860
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,666
VERY GOOD.

861
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,334
CAPTAIN,

862
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,920
METALLIC SUBSTANCE
OUTSIDE THE SHIP.

863
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,422
SPOCK!

864
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,924
LIEUTENANT, GET ME
SPOCK'S VOICE CHANNEL.

865
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,593
HIGHEST POSSIBLE GAIN.

866
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:04,803
GO AHEAD, SIR.

867
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,015
SPOCK, DO YOU READ ME?

868
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,016
DO YOU READ ME, SPOCK?
DO YOU READ ME?

869
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,893
COME IN, SPOCK.

870
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,853
SPOCK!

871
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,231
SCOTTY,
GET A TRACTOR BEAM.

872
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,982
CAPTAIN, WE DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH TIME
TO DO IT.

873
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,318
WE ONLY HAVE
A 53-SECOND
ESCAPE MARGIN.

874
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:20,653
I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT,
MR. SCOTT.

875
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,405
GET TWO TRACTOR BEAMS
ON THAT SHUTTLECRAFT.

876
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,157
AYE, SIR.
TRACTOR BEAMS ON.

877
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:29,245
[SPOCK]
CAPTAIN, I RECOMMEND
YOU ABANDON THE ATTEMPT.

878
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:33,291
DO NOT RISK THE SHIP
FURTHER ON MY BEHALF.

879
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,377
SHUT UP, SPOCK!
WE'RE RESCUING YOU.

880
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,631
WHY, THANK YOU,

881
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:42,592
<i>CAPTAIN</i> McCOY.

882
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,683
ALMOST OUT.

883
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,018
WE'RE APPROACHING
THE MEMBRANE, SIR.

884
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,562
TIME UNTIL EXPLOSION?

885
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:55,854
57 SECONDS, SIR.

886
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,983
MAINTAINING TRACTOR BEAMS
ON SHUTTLECRAFT, MR. SCOTT?

887
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,067
AYE, SIR.

888
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,154
BUT I CAN'T GUARANTEE
IT'LL HOLD WHEN
THE WARHEAD EXPLODES.

889
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,490
THE POWER LEVELS ARE--

890
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:09,034
THE POWER LEVELS
ARE DEAD, SIR.

891
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:22,047
YOU MAY HAVE JUST WRITTEN
OUR EPITAPH, MR. SCOTT.

892
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,259
[LARGE CRASH]

893
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,235

MR. CHEKOV, REPORT.

895
00:47:56,541 --> 00:48:00,586
THE ORGANISM
IS DESTROYED, SIR.

896
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:03,047
THE EXPLOSION
MUST HAVE RUPTURED
THE MEMBRANE

897
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,758
AND THROWN US CLEAR.

898
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,260
THE POWER'S
COMING BACK, SIR.

899
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,637
SHUTTLECRAFT?

900
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:13,098
I DON'T KNOW HOW,
SIR, BUT IT'S
STILL WITH US.

00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,823
OBVIOUSLY, CAPTAIN.

906
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,784
AND I HAVE SOME
FASCINATING DATA
ON THE ORGANISM.

907
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,452
DON'T BE
SO SMART, SPOCK.

908
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,747
YOU BOTCHED
THE ACETYLCHOLINE TEST.

909
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:36,873
LATER, LATER, LATER.

910
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,958
HA HA HA HA.

911
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,754
BRING THE SHUTTLECRAFT
ABOARD, UH, MR. SCOTT.

912
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:44,881

919

I'M STILL LOOKING FORWARD
