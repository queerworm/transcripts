<i>STARDATE, 5693.2.</i>

2
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,959
<i>THE</i> ENTERPRISE
<i>IS APPROACHING</i>

3
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:31,542
<i>THE LAST REPORTED POSITION</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> DEFIANT,

4
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:34,083
<i>WHICH VANISHED WITHOUT TRACE</i>
<i>THREE WEEKS AGO.</i>

5
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:38,667
<i>WE ARE IN UNSURVEYED</i>
<i>TERRITORY.</i>

6
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,291
CAPTAIN,WE ARE REGISTERING VERY
CURIOUS READINGS

7
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,333
FROM ALL SENSORS.

8
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,959
SPECIFY.
I CANNOT.

9
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:45,583
ACCORDING TO OUR
INSTRUMENTS,

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,041
SPACE ITSELF IS
LITERALLY BREAKING UP.

11
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,875
THERE IS NO
KNOWN PHENOMENON

12
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,000
WHICH WOULD ACCOUNT
FOR THESE READINGS.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
WHAT ABOUT
SENSOR FAILURE?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,208
NEGATIVE. I HAVE RUN
A COMPLETE CHECK
ON ALL SYSTEMS.

15
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,417
CAPTAIN,
WE'RE LOSING POWER
IN THE WARP ENGINES.

16
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:00,625
HOW BAD IS IT?

17
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:01,959
WE CAN BARELY
READ IT,

18
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,667
BUT I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS OF IT.

19
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,709
AND I CANNOT
FIND OUT THE CAUSE.

20
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:07,333
Chekov:

22
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,000
HOW ABOUT IT, SPOCK?

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,166
FASCINATING.

24
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,500
EXPLAIN.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,875
THERE IS VIRTUALLY
NO SENSOR CONTACT.

26
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:31,125
NO MASS ANALYSIS.
NO TRACE OF RADIATION.

27
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,834
WE SEE IT,
BUT OUR SENSORS INDICATE
IT IS NOT THERE.

28
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:46,834
THE<i> DEFIANT.</i>

29
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,083
MR. SULU,

30
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,625
AND CLOSE TO

31
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,208
AYE, AYE, SIR.

32
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,291
LIEUTENANT, OPEN UP
A HAILING FREQUENCY.

33
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,208
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO RAISE THEM, SIR.
THERE IS NO RESPONSE.

34
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,375
JUST WITHIN
TRANSPORTER RANGE, SIR.

35
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,250
GOOD.
MAINTAIN POSITION.

36
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,250
MR. SPOCK, MR. CHEKOV,
COME WITH ME.

37
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,959
DR. McCOY, REPORT
TO THE TRANSPORTER
ROOM IMMEDIATELY.

38
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,500
SCOTTY, YOU HAVE
THE CON.

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,667
AYE, SIR.

40
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,166
LOCKED IN ON
THE<i> DEFIANT</i> BRIDGE, SIR.

41
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,417
ENERGIZE.

42
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,417
<i>SPACE--</i>
<i>THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

43
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:38,375
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE.

44
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,875
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

45
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,583
<i>TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>STRANGE NEW WORLDS...</i>

46
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:46,417
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...</i>

47
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:50,542
<i>TO BOLDLY GO WHERE</i>
<i>NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.</i>

[WOMAN VOCALIZING]

49
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:49,917
HAS THERE
EVER BEEN A MUTINY
ON A STARSHIP BEFORE?

50
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,709
ABSOLUTELY NO RECORD
OF SUCH AN OCCURRENCE,

51
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,333
JIM.

52
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,333
THE CAPTAIN'S NECK
IS BROKEN.

53
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:26,125
THE SHIP IS STILL
FUNCTIONING, CAPTAIN.

54
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,792
IT IS LOGICAL
TO ASSUME THE MUTINEERS
ARE SOMEWHERE ABOARD.

55
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,500
USE THE SHIP'S SENSORS
TO LOCATE THEM.

56

ON MY ORDERS.

59
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,125
AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.

60
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,959
CAPTAIN, THERE'S
NO SIGN OF LIFE
ABOARD THIS VESSEL.

61
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,625
ODD, MR. SPOCK.
VERY ODD.

62
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,291
SPOCK, YOU STAY HERE
WITH ME.

63
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:55,125

TO ENGINEERING
AND LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS.

64
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,542
DR. McCOY, CHECK OUT
THE SICKBAY.

65
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,375
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

66
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,125
CANCEL THE SECURITY SQUAD

67
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,792
AND STAND BY
FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.

68
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,208
AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.

69
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,709
STANDING BY.

70
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,542
I CAN'T GET
AN ACCURATE FIX

71
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,291
ON THE<i> DEFIANT,</i>
<i>MR. SCOTT,</i>

72
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,125
BUT I KNOW
IT'S DRIFTING
AWAY FROM US.

73
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,125
SHALL I CORRECT
FOR RANGE, SIR?

74
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,125
AYE, I THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT.

75
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,166
KEEP US
WITHIN BEAMING RANGE,
BUT NOT TOO CLOSE.

77
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,000

78
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,667
REPORT, MR. CHEKOV.

79
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:30,166
JUST LIKE WHAT I FOUND
IN LIFE SUPPORT.

80
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,583
ALL DEAD.

81
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,208

83
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,834
McCOY HERE.

84
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:12,166
BONES, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT THEY ALL DIED OF?

85
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,208
I'D SAY THESE PEOPLE
KILLED EACH OTHER.

86
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,625
THEY WHAT?

87
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,000
YOU HEARD CORRECTLY, JIM.

88
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,834
THESE PEOPLE
KILLED EACH OTHER.

89
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:25,000
COULD MENTAL DISEASE
HAVE INFECTED ALL
OF THE CREW?

90
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,667
ACCORDING TO
THE SHIP'S LOG,

91
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:28,125
THE MEDICAL SURGEON
DOWN HERE

92
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,458
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
WAS GOING ON.

93
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,583
THE BEST I CAN DO IS
GET ALL THE READINGS
I CAN GET

94
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,750
AND ANALYZE THEM LATER.

95
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,375
WHAT THE DEVIL?

96
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,583
Kirk: BONES, WHAT IS IT?

97
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,625
BONES, WHAT IS IT?

98
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,208
ANSWER ME!

99
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:08,834
ANSWER ME!

100
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,625
JIM, THIS SHIP
IS DISSOLVING.

101
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,792
MY HAND JUST
PASSED THROUGH
A MAN AND A TABLE.

102
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,250

ON THE DOUBLE!

103

MR. SCOTT,
THE<i> DEFIANT...</i>

104
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,166

O'NEIL HERE.

107
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,542
YOU GOT THAT TRANSPORTER
WORKING YET, MISTER?

108
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,625
NO, SIR. NOT YET.

109
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,375
TAKE OVER, MR. SULU. I'LL BE
IN THE TRANSPORTER ROOM.

110
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,083

HIGH DEGREE OF CORRELATION

113

TO THOSE
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

114
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,000
YOU MEAN, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE<i> DEFIANT</i>

115
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,333
MIGHT BE HAPPENING
TO THE<i> ENTERPRISE?</i>

116
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,542
AFFIRMATIVE.

TO BEAM US BACK.

120
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:08,917
I CAN'T, SIR.
AT LEAST
NOT ALL AT ONCE.

121
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,875
WHY NOT?
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

122
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,959
EVERYTHING! THAT SHIP
YOU'RE IN IS FADING OUT,
AND IT'S--

123
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,875
WELL, IT'S
RIPPING THE INNARDS
OUT OF THIS ONE.

124
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,750
IT'S JAMMING
OUR TRANSPORTER
FREQUENCIES.

125
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,375
I'VE ONLY GOT
THREE OF THEM
WORKING,

126
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,208
AND I'M NOT SURE
OF THOSE.

127
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,834

131
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,583
I COULD BE
COMPLETING THE DATA.

132
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,750

133
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,333

IS A CHANCE---

134
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,625

THE CHANCES ARE.

135
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,125

DON'T ARGUE.

136
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,667

THE INFORMATION.

137
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,291
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

138

141
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,667

142
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,208
THE<i> DEFIANT</i> JUST VANISHED.

143
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:42,250
ANYTHING?

144
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,375
NEGATIVE.

145
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,583
THAT'S IT.
I'VE DONE ALL I CAN.

146
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,583
THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE TO
GRAB AHOLD OF AND BRING IN.

147
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:53,125
WHEN THAT SHIP WENT,
IT MUST HAVE TAKEN
THE CAPTAIN WITH IT.

148
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,417
<i>COMPUTER WORKING.</i>

149
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:11,750

<i>2 HOURS, 12 MINUTES.</i>

2 HOURS

152
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,583
WHY, THAT POWER LEAK
HAS UNBALANCED THE SHIP,

153
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,959
AND SHE'S STARTING
TO DRIFT.

154
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,667
I CAN'T HOLD HER
IN PLACE THAT LONG.

155
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:27,250
WE MUST TRY, MR. SCOTT.
THE FABRIC OF SPACE
IS VERY WEAK HERE.

156
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,000
IF WE DISTURB IT,
THERE WILL BE NO CHANCE

157
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,750
OF RETRIEVING
THE CAPTAIN ALIVE.

158
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,542
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL

159
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,542
ABOUT THIS REGION
OF SPACE.

160
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,125
WELL, PICTURE IT
THIS WAY, MR. CHEKOV.

161
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,917
WE EXIST
IN A UNIVERSE

162
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,875
WHICH COEXISTS
WITH A MULTITUDE
OF OTHERS

163
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,625
IN THE SAME
PHYSICAL SPACE.

164
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,834
AT CERTAIN
BRIEF PERIODS OF TIME,

165
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,875
AN AREA OF THEIR SPACE
OVERLAPS AN AREA OF OURS.

166
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,875
THAT IS A TIME
OF INTERPHASE,

167
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,333
DURING WHICH
WE CAN CONNECT

168
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,333

<i>UNIVERSE.</i>

169
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,834
MR. SPOCK?

170
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,583
WE WILL BE ABLE
TO RETRIEVE THE CAPTAIN

171
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,959
AT THAT TIME,
WON'T WE?

172
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,125
YES.

173
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,417
HOWEVER, THE DIMENSIONAL
STRUCTURE OF EACH UNIVERSE

174
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,208
IS TOTALLY DISSIMILAR.

175
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,500
ANY USE OF POWER
DISTURBS IT.

176
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,417
IF WE ARE NOT
EXTREMELY CAREFUL,

177
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:16,417
WE SHALL LOSE THE CAPTAIN
AND BECOME TRAPPED
OURSELVES.

178
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:17,792
I SEE.

179
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:20,208
AND DIE LIKE HIM?

180
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,542
AAH!

181
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,750
AAH!

182
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,917
AAH!

183
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:30,875
AAH!

184
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,041
[VOICE ECHOES]
CHEKOV!

185
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,041
AAH!

186
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,041
CHEKOV!

187
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,250
AAH!

188
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,375
CHEKOV!

189
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,208
SECURITY GUARDS
TO THE BRIDGE.

190
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,542
AYE, SIR.

191
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,333
WHAT HAPPENED,
MR. SPOCK?

192
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,166
I WAS ATTEMPTING
TO EXPLAIN TO MR. CHEKOV

193
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,208
THE NATURE OF OUR PROBLEMS
IN THIS SITUATION

194
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,625
WHEN HE ATTACKED.

195
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,417
DID ANYONE NOTICE
ANYTHING PECULIAR

196
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:01,834
IN HIS BEHAVIOR
BEFORE THIS?

197
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,542
I THINK HE HAD
SEVERAL SPASMS
OF PAIN.

198
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,667
DID HE SEEM TO BE
GETTING HYSTERICAL?

199
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:10,250
DOCTOR, HE SEEMED MORE
ANGRY THAN FRIGHTENED.

200
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,917
HE HAD NO CAUSE
TO BE ANGRY.

201
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,291
TAKE MR. CHEKOV
TO SICKBAY.

202
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,917
PUT HIM
UNDER RESTRAINT.

203
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,917
LIEUTENANT UHURA
IS CORRECT.

204
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,333
THERE WAS MURDEROUS FURY
IN CHEKOV--

205
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,834
THE SAME FURY
WHICH WAS EVIDENT
IN THE<i> DEFIANT.</i>

206
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:40,583
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS AFRAID OF.

207
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,375
WHATEVER IT WAS THAT DROVE
THE CREW OF THE<i> DEFIANT</i>
<i>TO MURDER EACH OTHER</i>

208
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,125
COULD BE COMMUNICABLE.

209
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,333
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU NEED
TO ISOLATE THE CAUSE?

210
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,750
TIME.

211
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,750
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
MR. SPOCK,

212
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,417
I THINK IT MIGHT BE
A WISE PRECAUTION

213
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:56,250
TO PUT SOME DISTANCE
BETWEEN US

214
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,792
AND THE<i> DEFIANT.</i>

215
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,417
IF WE ARE TO RECOVER
THE CAPTAIN,

216
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,291
WE MUST NOT MOVE.

217
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,041
HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE?

218
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:07,125
APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS
BEFORE THE ATTEMPT
CAN BE MADE.

219
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:11,458
SPOCK, ARE YOU SURE
THAT JIM IS STILL ALIVE?

220
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,458
IF THE CAPTAIN WAS CAUGHT
IN OUR TRANSPORTER BEAM

221
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,083
WHEN THE<i> DEFIANT</i>
<i>PHASED OUT,</i>

222
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,208
IT IS POSSIBLE
HE WAS SPARED
THE SHOCK OF TRANSITION

223
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,917
AND SURVIVED.

224
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,750
HOWEVER, IF WE ARE
TO RECOVER HIM,

225
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,125
WE MUST CATCH HIM
AT THE PRECISE MOMENT

226
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,083
DURING THE NEXT
INTERPHASE,
OR HE WILL DIE.

227
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,542
NOW, THERE CAN BE
NO MARGIN FOR ERROR.

228
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:36,208
HIS ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT
CAN PROVIDE
BREATHABLE AIR

229
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,667
FOR NO MORE THAN
3.62 HOURS.

230

A VISUAL SIGNAL.

246
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,542

247
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:31,375
<i>I AM COMMANDER LOSKENE.</i>

248
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,834
<i>YOU ARE TRESPASSING</i>

249

<i>IN A TERRITORIAL ANNEX</i>

250
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:39,208
<i>YOU MUST LEAVE THIS AREA</i>

252
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,917
COMMANDER, ACCORDING
TO THE FEDERATION,

253
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:47,083
THIS AREA
IS FREE SPACE.

254
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:47,750
<i>WE CLAIM THIS TERRITORY</i>

255
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,333
<i>AND ARE PREPARED</i>
<i>TO USE FORCE, IF NECESSARY,</i>

256
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,125
<i>TO PROTECT OUR PROPERTY.</i>

257
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,834
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR DISPLAY OF FORCE.

258
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:57,500
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
<i>IS RESPONDING TO</i>
<i>A DISTRESS SIGNAL</i>

259
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,375
FROM ONE OF OUR SHIPS
AND IS CURRENTLY ENGAGED
IN RESCUE OPERATIONS.

260
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,333
DO YOU WISH
TO ASSIST US?

261
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,625
<i>I FIND NO EVIDENCE</i>
<i>OF A DISABLED SHIP.</i>

262
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,333
<i>MY INSTRUMENTS INDICATE</i>

263
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,417
<i>THAT OURS ARE THE ONLY TWO</i>
<i>VESSELS IN THIS AREA.</i>

264
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,792
THE OTHER SHIP IS
INTERSPATIALLY TRAPPED.

265
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,458
IT SHOULD REAPPEAR
IN 1 HOUR AND 53 MINUTES.

266
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,417
WE REQUEST
YOU STAND BY UNTIL THEN.

267
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:21,917
<i>VERY WELL,</i> ENTERPRISE.

<i>WE DO NOT TOLERATE</i>
<i>DECEIT.</i>

272
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,875
IF WE COULD ONLY FIND
THE PROPER FILTERING
AGENT,

273
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:44,583
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

274
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,083
NEGATIVE.
IT'S THE THIRD FAILURE.

275
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:53,291
NURSE, TAKE THIS SAMPLE
AND RUN AN ANALYSIS
ON IT.

276
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,458
YES, DOCTOR.

277
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:01,083

[BOTH GRUNTING]

282
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,166
THANK YOU, NURSE.

283
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,625
CALL SECURITY.

284
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,166
I WANT TO HAVE
SOME CHECKS RUN
ON THIS MAN.

285
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,542
LOCK ON TO CAPTAIN KIRK'S
COORDINATES AND PREPARE

286
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,417
TO BRING HIM ABOARD,
MR. SCOTT.

287
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,125
BRING HIM ABOARD,
MR. SCOTT.

288
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,125
I'M TRYING.

289
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,125
CAPTAIN KIRK IS NOT
ON HIS DESIGNATED
COORDINATES, MR. SPOCK.

290
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,500
WELL, KEEP TRYING,
MR. SCOTT.

291
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,667
LIEUTENANT SULU,
EVALUATION.

292
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,667
SENSOR READINGS
ARE NOT CORRESPONDING

293
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:18,458
TO THOSE WE RECEIVED
THE LAST TIME WE SAW
THE<i> DEFIANT.</i>

294
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,458
IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT THOLIAN ENTRY
INTO THE AREA

295
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,500
HAS DISTURBED THE SPACE.

296
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,041
AND IF THAT
HAS OCCURRED...

297
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,333
McCOY TO BRIDGE.

298
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,709
SPOCK HERE.

299
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:33,125
HAS THE CAPTAIN
BEEN BEAMED ABOARD YET?

300
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,709
NEGATIVE, DOCTOR.

301
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:37,417
WELL, WHEN IS THAT
INTERPHASE GOING
TO HAPPEN?

302
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:40,333
THEORETICALLY,
IT ALREADY HAS
HAPPENED, DOCTOR,

303
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,291
HOWEVER, THE SHIP'S SENSORS
ARE NOT RESPONDING
AS PREDICTED.

304
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,500
WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU HAD THE THING
TIMED OUT.

305
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,083
I DID, DOCTOR.

306
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,625
THE SPACE WAS DISTURBED
BY THE THOLIANS.

307
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,417
YOU MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHETHER YOU'RE GONNA

308
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,083
BE ABLE TO RECOVER
THE CAPTAIN OR NOT?

309
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,333
NOT AT THIS INTERPHASE.
I SHALL HAVE
TO RECALCULATE

310
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,917
TO DETERMINE WHEN
THE NEXT INTERPHASE WILL OCCUR.

311
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,500
THEY DO NOT TAKE PLACE
AT REGULAR INTERVALS.

312
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,709
YOU CAN'T WAIT
FOR THE NEXT ONE.

313
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,458
WE'VE HAD
ANOTHER CASE
LIKE CHEKOV.

314
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,125
I'VE HAD TO CONFINE
MY ORDERLY TO
SICKBAY.

315
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,750
I HAVE CONFIDENCE
THAT YOU WILL SOON
ISOLATE THE CAUSE, DOCTOR,

316
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,667
AND PREVENT ANY FURTHER
SPREAD OF THE AFFLICTION.

317
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:15,667
THE DISEASE IS NOT
TRANSMITTED BY THE MEN,
MR. SPOCK.

318
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,417
THE CAUSE IS THE AREA
OF SPACE WE'RE IN.

319
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,625
IT'S AFFECTING
THE WHOLE CREW.

320
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,959
THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
OF THE BRAIN TISSUES

321
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:26,083
IN THE CENTRAL
NERVOUS SYSTEM
ARE DISTORTING.

322
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,709
AND THE MADNESS
THAT AFFECTED
THE<i> DEFIANT'S</i> CREW

323
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:30,625
WILL SOON HAPPEN
TO THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

324
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,291
NOW, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET THIS SHIP
OUT OF HERE!

325
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,667
MR. SPOCK,
WE'RE BEING
FIRED UPON.

326
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,208

THOLIAN PUNCTUALITY.

327
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,250

HOLD POWER STEADY

330
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,458
AND CUT OFF ALL
UNNECESSARY EXPENDITURES.

331
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,333
MR. SULU, DIVERT ALL BUT
EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE POWER

332
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,291
TO THE SHIELDS.

333
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,417
BUT SIR, THAT WILL
REDUCE OUR
PHASER POWER BY 50%.

334
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,417
MR. SPOCK!

335
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,709
SCOTT TO BRIDGE!

336
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,709
SPOCK HERE.

337
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,333
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE
TO USE THE PHASERS,

338
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,667
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT
THAT SHIP OUT THERE!

339
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,000
UNDERSTOOD.

340
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,583
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
OPEN A CHANNEL
TO THE THOLIAN SHIP.

341
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,792
AYE, SIR.

342
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,542
MR. SULU, LOCK IN
PHASER TRACKING CONTROLS.

343
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:28,500
PHASERS LOCKED IN,
SIR.

344
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,959
THERE'S NO RESPONSE
ON ANY FREQUENCY, SIR.

345
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,542
WHAT'S THE USE OF
THIS BATTLE, SPOCK?

346
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,667
YOU'VE LOST JIM.
TAKE THE SHIP
OUT OF HERE.

347
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,959
READY, MR. SULU?

348
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,458
READY, MR. SPOCK.

349
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,041
FIRE.

350
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,458
A HIT, MR. SPOCK!

351
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,959
ENGINEERING,
STATUS REPORT.

352
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,792
MR. SCOTT--

353
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,792
SPOCK, THAT HIT
WE TOOK FROM THE THOLIANS

354
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:05,709
HAS FUSED OUR POWER SUPPLY
CONVERTERS.

355
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:08,250
I CAN'T DO A THING
WITH THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> NOW.

356
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,542
SHE'S BOUND TO DRIFT,

357
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:12,834
MAYBE RIGHT THROUGH
THAT DOORWAY OUT THERE.

358
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:15,750
CAN YOU ESTIMATE
MINIMUM TIME REQUIRED
FOR REPAIR?

359
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,834
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF SHE CAN BE REPAIRED.

360
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,458
ARE YOU SATISFIED?

361
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,625
SPOCK,
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

362
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,834
THE DECISION TO FIGHT
WAS LOGICAL.

363
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:29,792
LACK OF TIME
PREVENTED ANY OTHER
COURSE OF ACTION.

364
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,625
THE THOLIAN SHIP
HAD TO BE DISABLED.

365
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,792
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN
WHAT COULD'VE HAPPENED

366
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:37,792
AND DONE EVERYTHING
IN YOUR POWER
TO SAFEGUARD YOUR CREW.

367
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:41,083
THAT IS THE MARK OF
A STARSHIP CAPTAIN,
LIKE JIM.

368
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,875
DOCTOR, I HARDLY BELIEVE
THIS IS THE TIME
FOR COMPARISONS.

369
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,959
PLEASE GO AT ONCE
TO YOUR LABORATORY

370
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,834
AND SEARCH FOR AN ANTIDOTE
TO THE EFFECTS
OF THIS SPACE.

371
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:51,792
THAT IS YOUR PRIMARY TASK,
SINCE WE MUST REMAIN HERE.

372
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:56,959
MR. SPOCK...

373
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,041
SOMETHING HAS
JUST ENTERED
SENSOR RANGE.

374
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,250
IT'S ANOTHER
THOLIAN, SIR.

375
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,500
LOSKENE MUST'VE
CONTACTED THEM

376
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,959
WHEN HE TRIED
TO INTERCEPT US.

377
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,375
FASCINATING.

378
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,542
SHALL I LOCK IN
REMAINING
PHASER POWER, SIR?

379
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:09,959
NEGATIVE.
LIEUTENANT UHURA,

380
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:11,583
CAN YOU OPEN A CHANNEL
TO THE APPROACHING VESSEL?

381
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,166
THEY'RE REFUSING RECEPTION,
SIR. I CAN'T--

382
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,834
DISTANCE, MR. SULU.

383
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,417
JUST BEYOND
PHASER RANGE, SIR.

384
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,834
WHAT IS THAT?

385
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,166
MR. SULU, I SHALL
RUN AN ANALYSIS
ON THOSE FILAMENTS.

386
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:46,625
TIE IN ALL SENSORS
TO THE SHIP'S LIBRARY
COMPUTER CONSOLE.

387
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:51,000
SWITCH SCANNERS.

388
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,625
YES, SIR.

389
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,333
THERE'S NO ANALOG
TO THIS STRUCTURE

390
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,333
IN FEDERATION TECHNOLOGY.

391
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,834
IT IS, HOWEVER,
AN ENERGY FIELD,

392
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,875
AND IF THE THOLIANS
ARE SUCCESSFUL

393
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,458
IN COMPLETING THIS STRUCTURE

394
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:12,500
BEFORE WE HAVE
COMPLETED OUR REPAIRS...

395
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,583
WE SHALL NOT
SEE HOME AGAIN.

396
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,792
DOCTOR,
YOUR LAST REPORT
ON AN ANTIDOTE

397
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:51,542
ON THE EFFECTS
OF THIS SPACE
WAS NEGATIVE.

398
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:53,417
IT'S STILL NEGATIVE,
MR. SPOCK.

399
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:56,750
THARAGEN SEEMS TO BE
THE MOST PROMISING SUBSTANCE
TESTED SO FAR.

400
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,417
WE'RE PROGRESSING.

401
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:01,917
THE URGENCY REQUIRES
YOUR PERSONAL ATTENTION
IN THE LABORATORY.

402
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:05,083
MY STAFF IS WORKING
AROUND THE CLOCK.

403
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:10,208
MY BEING THERE WILL NOT
AFFECT THE BIOCHEMISTRY
OF ANY OF THE TESTS.

404
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:14,834
THIS SERVICE REQUIRES
MY PERSONAL ATTENTION,
MR. SPOCK.

405
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:34,000
A FEW HOURS AGO,

406
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,166
THE CAPTAIN ELECTED TO
REMAIN ONBOARD THE<i> DEFIANT</i>

407
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,917
SO THAT THREE MEMBERS
OF HIS CREW
WOULD HAVE THE BEST CHANCE

408
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:44,166
OF RETURNING SAFELY
TO THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

409
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:48,208
HIS CONCERN
WAS NOT ONLY FOR THEM,

410
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:52,542
BUT FOR ALL THE MEMBERS
OF THE CREW OF THIS SHIP.

411
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:57,834
YOU ALL KNOW
THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS.

412
00:26:57,834 --> 00:27:00,542
YOU WERE FIRED UPON
BY THE THOLIAN SHIP.

413
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,625
AT THAT TIME,

414
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:06,250
CAPTAIN KIRK
MAY HAVE BEEN ALIVE.

415
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,709
I DEEMED IT NECESSARY
TO RETURN THE THOLIAN FIRE

416
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:12,917
FOR THE SAFETY
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

417
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:16,625
THE THOLIAN SHIP
HAS BEEN DISABLED.

418
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,125
BUT AS A RESULT
OF THE BATTLE,

419
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:21,083
WE MUST ACCEPT THE FACT

420
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:25,709
THAT CAPTAIN KIRK
IS NO LONGER ALIVE.

421
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:27,834
AAH!

422
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,625
TAKE HIM TO SICKBAY.

423
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,542
PUT HIM IN RESTRAINT.

424
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,667
I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT

425
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:58,625
TO VOICE THE QUALITY
OF RESPECT AND ADMIRATION

426
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,208
WHICH CAPTAIN KIRK
COMMANDED.

427
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:05,500
EACH OF YOU
MUST EVALUATE THE LOSS

428
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,500
IN THE PRIVACY
OF YOUR OWN THOUGHTS.

429
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,333
ATTENTION.

430
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,709
DISMISSED.

431
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:33,917
THERE IS A DUTY
TO BE PERFORMED

432
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,875
IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,

433
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:39,000
WHICH REQUIRES
OUR PRESENCE.

434
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,542
IT CAN WAIT, DOCTOR.

435
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:43,750
MY DUTIES REQUIRE
MY IMMEDIATE PRESENCE
ON THE BRIDGE.

436
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,917
THE CAPTAIN
LEFT A MESSAGE TAPE.

437
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:48,500
IT WAS HIS ORDER THAT IT BE
REVIEWED BY BOTH OF US,

438
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
SHOULD HE EVER BE
DECLARED DEAD.

439
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,166
YOU HAVE JUST
DECLARED JIM DEAD.

440
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,875
IT WILL WAIT FOR
A MORE SUITABLE MOMENT,
DOCTOR.

441
00:28:55,875 --> 00:29:00,583
WHY? ARE YOU AFRAID IT'LL
CHANGE YOUR PRESENT STATUS?

442
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,458
THE MENTAL
AND PHYSICAL STATE
OF THIS CREW

443
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,417
ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY,
DOCTOR.

444
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:07,166
AT THE MOMENT,
THEY ARE YOUR
TOP PRIORITY.

445
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:09,709
THE CAPTAIN'S LAST ORDER
IS TOP PRIORITY,

446
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:13,375
AND YOU WILL
HONOR THAT ORDER
BEFORE YOU TAKE OVER.

447
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,291
HE WAS A HERO IN EVERY
SENSE OF THE WORD,

448
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,750
YET HIS LIFE
WAS SACRIFICED
FOR NOTHING.

449
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,333
THE ONE THING THAT
WOULD HAVE GIVEN
HIS DEATH MEANING

450
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,166
IS THE SAFETY
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

451
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,041
NOW YOU'VE MADE THAT
IMPOSSIBLE, MR. SPOCK.

452
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,208
WE CAME HERE FOR
A SPECIFIC PURPOSE, DOCTOR.

453
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:42,208
MAYBE NOT THE SAME ONE.

454
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:45,792
I REALLY CAME HERE
TO FIND OUT WHY YOU
STAYED AND FOUGHT.

455
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:48,875
THE CAPTAIN WOULD HAVE REMAINED
TO RECOVER A MEMBER
OF THE CREW

456
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,458
AT THE RISK OF HIS OWN LIFE
OR EVEN THE SHIP.

457
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,166
YES, HE WOULD,
MR. SPOCK,

458
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,417
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THAT DECISION TO MAKE.

459
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:58,375
WHAT DID YOU HAVE
TO GAIN BY FIGHTING
THE THOLIANS?

460
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:01,750
YOU COULD HAVE
ASSURED YOURSELF
OF A CAPTAINCY

461
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,500
BY LEAVING THE AREA.

462
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,542
BUT YOU CHOSE TO STAY.
WHY?

463
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:08,625
I NEED NOT EXPLAIN
MY RATIONALE TO YOU

464
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,959
OR TO ANY OTHER MEMBER
OF THIS CREW.

465
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:14,542
THERE IS A MARGIN
OF VARIATION
IN ANY EXPERIMENT.

466
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:17,709
WHILE THERE WAS A CHANCE,
I WAS BOUND
LEGALLY AND MORALLY

467
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:20,250
TO ASCERTAIN
THE CAPTAIN'S STATUS.

468
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,291
YOU MEAN TO BE SURE
IF HE WAS DEAD.

469
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,750
WELL, YOU MADE CERTAIN
OF THAT.

470
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,000
THAT IS ENOUGH, DOCTOR.
WE BOTH HAVE
OTHER THINGS TO DO.

471
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,750
YES, I HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO.

472
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,583
IF THIS CREW
IS TO SURVIVE,

473
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,166
I HAVE TO FIND
AN ANTIDOTE

474
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,166
TO THIS SPACE
YOU'VE LOCKED US INTO.

475
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:42,083
YOU WILL RETURN
TO YOUR DUTY

476
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:44,375
AS SOON AS WE'VE DISCHARGED
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES HERE.

477
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,333
THERE'S NO HURRY,
MR. SPOCK.

478
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,417
THE ANTIDOTE PROBABLY
DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

479
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:50,250
VULCANS
ARE PROBABLY IMMUNE,

480
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,000
SO JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

481
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:00,333
I MUST ADMIT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND YOU, SPOCK,

482
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,792
BUT I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

483
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,208
THAT YOU WOULD
WANT JIM'S COMMAND.

484
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,625
BUT YOU MUST KNOW
THAT IF YOU GET US
OUT OF THIS SITUATION,

485
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,333
THEY'LL PIN A MEDAL
ON YOUR CHEST

486
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,041
AND GIVE YOU COMMAND
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

487
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:14,083
DOCTOR,
I<i> AM</i> IN COMMAND
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

488
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,959
I WOULD LIKE TO
REMEDY THAT SITUATION.

489
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:24,583
[BEEP]

490
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,375
IF YOU BELIEVE
I HAVE ACTED IRREGULARLY,

491
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,333
THEN RELIEVE ME OF DUTY.

492
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:33,500
THAT IS YOUR PREROGATIVE
AS MEDICAL OFFICER
OF THIS SHIP.

493
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,250
<i>BONES, SPOCK...</i>

494
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,250
<i>SINCE YOU ARE</i>
<i>PLAYING THIS TAPE,</i>

495
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,000
<i>WE WILL ASSUME</i>
<i>THAT I AM DEAD.</i>

496
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,792
<i>NOW, THE TACTICAL SITUATION</i>
<i>IS CRITICAL,</i>

497
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:45,500
<i>AND BOTH OF YOU ARE LOCKED</i>
<i>IN MORTAL COMBAT.</i>

498
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,291
<i>IT MEANS, SPOCK, THAT YOU</i>
<i>HAVE CONTROL OF THE SHIP</i>

499
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,750
<i>AND ARE PROBABLY MAKING</i>

500
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,792
<i>THE MOST</i>
<i>DIFFICULT DECISIONS</i>
<i>OF YOUR CAREER.</i>

501
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:55,333
<i>I CAN OFFER ONLY</i>
<i>ONE SMALL PIECE OF ADVICE,</i>

502
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,500
<i>FOR WHATEVER</i>
<i>IT'S WORTH--</i>

503
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,417
<i>USE EVERY SCRAP</i>
<i>OF KNOWLEDGE</i>
<i>AND LOGIC YOU HAVE</i>

504
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,333
<i>TO SAVE THE SHIP,</i>

505
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:07,000
<i>BUT TEMPER YOUR JUDGMENT</i>
<i>WITH INTUITIVE INSIGHT.</i>

506
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,542
<i>I BELIEVE YOU HAVE</i>
<i>THOSE QUALITIES,</i>

00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:29,917
OH, WELL,
ONE GOOD SLUG OF THIS,

681
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:31,917
AND YOU COULD HIT A MAN
WITH PHASER STUN,

682
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:34,709
AND HE'D NEVER FEEL IT
OR EVEN KNOW IT.

683
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,542
DOES IT MAKE
A GOOD MIX
WITH SCOTCH?

684
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:43,166
IT SHOULD.

685
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:45,375
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

686
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,333
WELL, DRINK IT DOWN,
SPOCK.

687
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:57,375
IT'S THE HUMAN THING
TO DO.

688
00:43:57,375 --> 00:44:00,166
THAT'S
A MEDICAL ORDER...

689
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:02,166
CAPTAIN.

690
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:15,625
[SIREN]

691
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:19,208
WELCOME BACK,
LIEUTENANT.

692
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:20,750
THANK YOU, SIR.

693
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,959
YOUR ABSENCE WAS
KEENLY FELT, MR. CHEKOV.

694
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,667
THANK YOU, MR. SPOCK.

695
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:26,458
ESTIMATED TIME
FOR COMPLETION
OF THE THOLIAN WEB.

696
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,917
2 MINUTES, SIR.

697
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:29,375
ARE THE SHIPS COMPUTERS
PROGRAMMED

698
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,375
FOR ENTRY
INTO INTERSPACE?

699
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:34,667
YES, SIR. THE SHIP CAN DRIVE
INTO INTERSPACE AT ANY TIME.

700
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:37,166
SPOCK TO ENGINEERING.

701
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:38,333
SCOTT HERE.

702
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:40,125
PREPARE FOR INTERPHASE
IN 15 SECONDS.

703
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:41,917
AYE, SIR.
STANDING BY.

704
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:43,875
MR. SPOCK,
THEY'RE GETTING READY
TO CLOSE THE WEB.

705
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:49,291
INTERPHASE
IN 10 SECONDS,

706
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:50,834
9,

707
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:52,041
8,

708
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,917
7,

709
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:55,250
6,

710
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,500
5...

711
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,166
STAND BY WITH FULL POWER.

712
00:44:58,166 --> 00:45:00,917
4...
SHE'S ONLY UP TO 76%.

713
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:02,125
IT WILL HAVE TO DO.

714
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:03,500
1.

715
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,417
READY TO TRANSPORT
ON MY ORDER.

716
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,667
I SEE HIM.
THERE HE IS!

717
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,542
IT'S THE CAPTAIN.

718
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:15,625
SIR,
THE TRACTOR FIELD
IS ACTIVATING.

719
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,500
WE'RE BEING
PULLED OUT OF HERE.

720
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,583
TRY TO MAINTAIN POSITION,
MR. SULU.

721
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,000
I CAN'T, SIR.

722
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,500
ENGINEERING,
BRING SHIP'S POWER
UP TO FULL CAPABILITY.

723
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:36,959
WHERE ARE WE NOW,
MR. SPOCK?

724
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,000
CAPTAIN, WE HAVE DESTROYED
THE THOLIANS' WEB.

725
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,458
NEGATIVE, ENSIGN.

726
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,875
UTILIZING THE SHIP'S POWER
HAS THROWN US CLEAR OF IT.

727
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,083
COMPUTE THE DISTANCE
FROM THE ORIGINAL LOCATION.

728
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,417
AT ONCE, SIR.

729
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:57,375
HAVE WE LOST
THE CAPTAIN?

730
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,458
WE SHALL SOON SEE,
LIEUTENANT.

731
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:02,750
THE SHIP HAS BEEN THROWN
EXACTLY 2.72 PARSECS

732
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,542
DISTANT FROM
OUR PREVIOUS POSITION.

733
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:08,417
GOOD. SINCE THE CAPTAIN
WAS LOCKED INTO
OUR TRANSPORTER BEAM

734
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:10,291
WHEN WE WERE THROWN CLEAR
OF THE INTERPHASE AREA,

735
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:12,417
HE SHOULD'VE BEEN
DRAWN HERE WITH US.

736
00:46:12,417 --> 00:46:14,083
SPOCK TO TRANSPORTER ROOM.

737
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:15,542
McCOY HERE.

738
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:18,291
THE CAPTAIN'S OXYGEN SUPPLY
IS RUNNING OUT NOW.

739
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:21,208
ARE YOU STANDING BY
WITH A HYPO OF
TRIOX-COMPOUND FOR HIM?

740
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:23,125
I'M READY,
MR. SPOCK.

741
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,083
PREPARE TO TRANSPORT ON
THE CAPTAIN'S COORDINATES
ON MY ORDER.

742
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,417
READY,
MR. SPOCK.

743
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,208
MR. SPOCK, IT'S HIM!

744
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:37,792
IT'S THE CAPTAIN!

745
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:40,417
I SEE HIM, ENSIGN.

746
00:46:41,959 --> 00:46:43,917
I SEE HIM.

747
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:48,542
NOW, DOCTOR.

748
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:21,250
BONES.

749
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,000
WELCOME HOME, JIM.

750
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:35,667
I HAD A WHOLE UNIVERSE
TO MYSELF

751
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,875
AFTER THE<i> DEFIANT</i>
<i>WAS THROWN OUT.</i>

752
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:40,792
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY
NO ONE ELSE IN IT.

753
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:45,625
I MUST SAY I PREFER
A CROWDED UNIVERSE
MUCH BETTER.

754
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:47,709
HOW DID YOU TWO
GET ALONG WITHOUT ME?

755
00:47:47,709 --> 00:47:49,500
OH, WE MANAGED.

756
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,375
MR. SPOCK GAVE THE ORDERS,
AND I FOUND THE ANSWERS.

757
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:54,792
N-NO PROBLEMS
BETWEEN YOU?

758
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:56,542
NONE WORTH REPORTING,
CAPTAIN.

759
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:58,625
TRY ME.

760
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,834
MMM, ONLY SUCH
MINOR DISTURBANCES,

761
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:05,333
AS ARE INEVITABLE
WHEN HUMANS
ARE INVOLVED.

762
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,583
WHICH HUMANS,
MR. SPOCK?

763
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:10,959
HE MEANS THAT WHEN
HUMANS BECOME INVOLVED
WITH VULCANS, JIM.

764
00:48:10,959 --> 00:48:12,792
AH, YES.

765
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:14,333
I UNDERSTAND.

766
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,709
WELL,
I HOPE MY LAST ORDERS

767
00:48:17,709 --> 00:48:19,500
WERE HELPFUL
IN SOLVING ANY PROBLEMS

768
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,166
THAT YOU DON'T FEEL
WORTH REPORTING.

769
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,208
ORDERS, CAPTAIN?

770
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:27,083
WHAT ORDERS ARE YOU
REFERRING TO, JIM?

771
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:29,291
MY LAST ORDERS.

772
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:32,166
TH-THE LAST ORDERS THAT
I LEFT FOR BOTH--
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

773
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,583
THE LAST TAPED ORDERS.

774
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:39,208
OH, THOSE ORDERS.
WELL, THERE WASN'T TIME.

775
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,208
WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE
TO LISTEN TO THEM.

776
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:44,166
NO. YOU SEE,
THE CRISIS WAS UPON US

777
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:47,333
AND THEN PASSED
SO QUICKLY, CAPTAIN,
THAT WE...

778
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:49,041
GOOD.

779
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:51,000
GOOD.

780
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,333
WELL, I HOPE WE WON'T HAVE
SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES

781
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:56,875
TO TEST THOSE ORDERS...

782
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,959
WHICH YOU NEVER HEARD.

783
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:06,166
AHEAD WARP FACTOR 2,
MR. SULU.

784
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:08,542
WARP FACTOR 2, SIR.
