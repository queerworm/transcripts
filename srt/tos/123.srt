1
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:06,214
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 3192.1.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,133
THE ENTERPRISE
IS EN ROUTE

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,928
TO STAR CLUSTER
NGC321.

4
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,221
OBJECTIVE--TO OPEN
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:17,309
WITH THE CIVILIZATIONS
KNOWN TO BE THERE.

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,269
WE HAVE SENT A MESSAGE
TO EMINIAR VII,

7
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,355
PRINCIPAL PLANET
OF THE STAR CLUSTER,

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,274
INFORMING THEM
OF OUR FRIENDLY INTENTIONS.

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,360
WE ARE AWAITING
AN ANSWER.

10
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,569
NOTHING YET,
LIEUTENANT?

11
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:28,320
NOTHING, CAPTAIN.

12
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,572
HAILING FREQUENCIES
ARE OPEN.

13
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,500
HAVE YOU RECEIVED
AN ANSWER TO YOUR
MESSAGE YET, CAPTAIN?

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,918
NOTHING YET,
AMBASSADOR.

15
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,378
WE'RE AWAITING A REPLY.

16
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,880
TODAY IS THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE HAD ANY EVIDENCE

17
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:47,339
THAT THEY'VE PICKED UP
OUR SIGNAL.

18
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,968
CAPTAIN, MESSAGE COMING IN
FROM EMINIAR VII.

19
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,054
SIR, IT'S CODE 710.

20
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,556
ARE YOU SURE?

21
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,641
POSITIVE.
IT REPEATS OVER
AND OVER AGAIN.

22
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,351
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN SOMETHING?

23
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,520
CODE 710 MEANS
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES

24
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,438
ARE WE TO APPROACH
THAT PLANET--

25
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,024
NO CIRCUMSTANCES
WHATSOEVER.

26
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,942
YOU WILL DISREGARD
THAT SIGNAL, CAPTAIN.

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,403
MR. FOX,
IT IS THEIR PLANET.

28
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,363
CAPTAIN,
IN THE PAST 20 YEARS,

29
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,408
THOUSANDS OF LIVES
HAVE BEEN LOST
IN THIS QUADRANT--

30
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,576
LIVES THAT
COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED

31
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,286
IF THE FEDERATION
HAD A TREATY FOR HERE.

32
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,040
WE NEED
TO HAVE THAT PORT,
AND I'M HERE TO GET IT.

33
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,750
BY DISREGARDING
CODE 710,

34
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,543
YOU MIGHT WELL INVOLVE US
IN AN INTERPLANETARY WAR.

35
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,171
I'M QUITE PREPARED
TO TAKE THAT RISK.

36
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,548
YOU ARE.

37
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,134
I'M THINKING ABOUT
THIS SHIP, MY CREW.

38
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,847
I HAVE MY ORDERS, CAPTAIN,
AND NOW YOU HAVE YOURS.

39
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,390
YOU WILL PROCEED
ON COURSE.

40
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,476
ACHIEVE ORBIT STATUS
AND JUST LEAVE
THE REST TO ME.

41
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,728
YOU ARE WELL AWARE

42
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,064
THAT MY MISSION GIVES ME
THE POWER OF COMMAND.

43
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,399
I NOW EXERCISE IT.

44
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,484
YOU WILL PROCEED
ON COURSE.

45
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,194
THAT'S A DIRECT ORDER.

46
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,372
IN VIEW OF CODE 710,
CAPTAIN, MAY I SUGGEST--

47
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,665
YES, MR. SPOCK.

48
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,709
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.
CONDITION--YELLOW ALERT.

49
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,629
PHASER CREWS STAND BY.
DEFLECTOR SHIELDS UP.

50
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,256
WE'RE GOING IN,
GENTLEMEN--
PEACEFULLY, I HOPE,

51
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,592
BUT PEACEFULLY
OR NOT...

52
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,677
WE'RE GOING IN.

53
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,522
SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

54
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,569
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

55
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,487
ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--

56
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:37,699
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

57
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,745
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

58
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,457
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

59
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,534
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 3192.5.

60
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,912
NOW IN STANDARD ORBIT
AROUND PLANET EMINIAR VII.

61
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,497
MY ORDERS ARE CLEAR--

62
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,708
WE MUST ESTABLISH
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS

63
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,208
AT ALL COST.

64
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,378
PREPARING TO BEAM DOWN
TO PLANET'S SURFACE.

65
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,296
WE KNOW VERY LITTLE
ABOUT THEM.

66
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,132
THEIR CIVILIZATION
IS ADVANCED.

67
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,426
THEY'VE HAD SPACEFLIGHT
FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES,

68
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,930
BUT THEY'VE
NEVER VENTURED BEYOND
THEIR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM.

69
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,265
WHEN FIRST CONTACTED
MORE THAN 50 YEARS AGO,

70
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:48,020
EMINIAR VII WAS AT WAR
WITH ITS NEAREST NEIGHBOR.

71
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,604
ANYTHING ELSE?

72
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,482
THE EARTH EXPEDITION
MAKING THE REPORT

73
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,318
FAILED TO RETURN
FROM ITS MISSION.

74
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:59,239
THE U.S.S. "VALIANT."

75
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,119
LISTED
AS MISSING IN SPACE.

76
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,245
KIRK, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT
YOU GOING DOWN ALONE?

77
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,580
NOT ALONE,
MR. AMBASSADOR.

78
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,623
I'M TAKING SOME
SECURITY PEOPLE
WITH ME.

79
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:09,416
IT IS MY PREROGATIVE.

80
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,501
I CAN'T RISK
BEAMING YOU DOWN THERE

81
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,254
UNTIL I KNOW WHAT
KIND OF A RECEPTION
YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE.

82
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,506
YOUR SAFETY IS MY
RESPONSIBILITY. THOSE
ARE MY ORDERS, SIR.

83
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,799
MR. SPOCK.

84
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,218
TRANSPORTER ROOM
STANDING BY, CAPTAIN.

85
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,343
WHAT COORDINATES?

86
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,762
WE'VE SELECTED A SITE
WHICH, FROM THE TRAFFIC,

87
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,139
WOULD SEEM TO BE NEAR
AN OFFICIAL ESTABLISHMENT.

88
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,348
Kirk: FINAL
SENSOR READINGS?

89
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,475
NO HOSTILITY
DIRECTED TOWARD US.

90
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,603
NO APPARENT NOTICE
TAKEN OF US AT ALL,

91
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,354
WHICH SEEMS STRANGE.

92
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,190
THEY DID SCAN US
WHEN WE ASSUMED ORBIT.

93
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,610
OBVIOUSLY,
THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE.

94
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,153
SHIP'S DEFENSES?

95
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,571
SCREENS DOWN,

96
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,782
BUT ALL DEFENSIVE DETAILS
ON GENERAL ALERT STATUS,
CAPTAIN.

97
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,325
GOOD.

98
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,869
THE LANDING PARTY

99
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,288
WILL PICK UP
PHASER NUMBER 1s
FROM THE ARSENAL.

100
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,497
KEEP THEM
INCONSPICUOUS.

101
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,040
MR. SCOTT.
YES, SIR?

102
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,458
THE SHIP IS YOURS.

103
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,128
TAKE CARE OF HER
UNTIL I COME BACK.

104
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,129
AYE, AYE, SIR.

105
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,214
AND HAVE
A BONNY TRIP.

106
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,007
WE'LL DO OUR BEST.

107
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,634
LET'S GO.

108
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,159
THEY WILL MATERIALIZE THERE.

109
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,910
REMEMBER YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.

110
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,289
THEY ARE TO BE TREATED
CORRECTLY, NOTHING MORE.

111
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,110
I'M CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK
OF THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE"

112
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,987
REPRESENTING THE UNITED
FEDERATION OF PLANETS.

113
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,655
I KNOW.

114
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,490
I'M MEA 3.

115
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,492
I CONGRATULATE YOU
ON YOUR INSTRUMENTATION.

116
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,287
YOU'VE COME DIRECTLY TO
THE DIVISION OF CONTROL.

117
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,371
IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME,
PLEASE?

118
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,797
CAPTAIN, I WISH--

119
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,465
YES?

120
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,218
YOU WERE WARNED
NOT TO COME HERE.

121
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:27,054
I HAD ORDERS
TO COME HERE.

122
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,306
WHY DID YOUR PEOPLE
TELL US TO STAY AWAY?

123
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,892
IT WAS FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY,
CAPTAIN.

124
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,101
I SEE NO DANGER HERE.

125
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,937
THE DANGER EXISTS.

126
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,106
NEVERTHELESS, YOU ARE HERE.

127
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,568
IT WOULD BE MORALLY INCORRECT
TO DO LESS THAN EXTEND
OUR HOSPITALITY.

128
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,529
ANAN 7 AND MEMBERS
OF THE HIGH COUNCIL
AWAIT YOU.

129
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,781
IF YOU WILL COME
THIS WAY, PLEASE...

130
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,101
I'M CAPTAIN KIRK.

131
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,853
THIS IS
MY FIRST OFFICER,
MR. SPOCK;

132
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,731
LIEUTENANTS GALWAY,
OSBORNE;

133
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,149
YEOMAN TAMURA.

134
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,568
WELCOME TO EMINIAR VII.

135
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,742
WELL, CAPTAIN,
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU?

136
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,287
MY MISSION IS TO ESTABLISH
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS

137
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,330
BETWEEN YOUR
PEOPLE AND MINE.

138
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,332
THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

139
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,584
WOULD YOU MIND
TELLING ME WHY?

140
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,044
BECAUSE OF THE WAR.

141
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,504
YOU'RE STILL AT WAR?

142
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:49,094
WE HAVE BEEN AT WAR
FOR 500 YEARS.

143
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,346
YOU CONCEAL IT
VERY WELL.

144
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,472
MR. SPOCK?

145
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,475
SIR, WE HAVE COMPLETELY
SCANNED YOUR PLANET.

146
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,144
WE FIND IT HIGHLY ADVANCED,

147
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,354
PROSPEROUS
IN A MATERIAL SENSE,

148
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,648
COMFORTABLE
FOR YOUR PEOPLE,

149
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,276
AND PEACEFUL
IN THE EXTREME,

150
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,236
YET YOU SAY
YOU ARE AT WAR.

151
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,780
THERE IS
NO EVIDENCE OF THIS.

152
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,616
CASUALTIES AMONG
OUR CIVILIAN POPULATION

153
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,245
TOTAL FROM
1 TO 3 MILLION DEAD
EACH YEAR

154
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,956
FROM DIRECT ENEMY ATTACK.

155
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,958
THAT IS ONE REASON,
CAPTAIN,

156
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,668
WHY WE TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY.

157
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:25,588
AS LONG AS YOUR SHIP
IS ORBITING OUR PLANET,

158
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,923
IT IS IN SEVERE DANGER.

159
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,343
WITH WHOM
ARE YOU AT WAR?

160
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,052
THE THIRD PLANET
IN OUR SYSTEM,

161
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,846
CALLED VENDIKAR,

162
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,848
ORIGINALLY SETTLED
BY OUR PEOPLE

163
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,433
AND NOW
A RUTHLESS ENEMY--

164
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,269
HIGHLY ADVANCED
TECHNOLOGICALLY.

165
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,396
[ALARM BUZZING]

166
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,650
PLEASE EXCUSE ME.

167
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,194
VENDIKAR IS ATTACKING.

168
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,947
MEA, PREPARE
FOR OUR GUESTS.

169
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:53,992
STRANGE.

170
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,576
TO SAY THE LEAST.

171
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,744
IT WILL NOT
LAST LONG.

172
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,997
DON'T YOU
TAKE SHELTER?

173
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,957
THERE IS
NO SHELTER, CAPTAIN.

174
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,501
ARE THESE ATTACKS
FREQUENT?

175
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,628
OH, YES, AND WE WILL
RETALIATE IMMEDIATELY.

176
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,549
OH!

177
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,136
Kirk:
WHAT IS IT?

178
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,680
A HIT RIGHT HERE
IN THE CITY.

179
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,896
DO YOU HEAR
ANY EXPLOSIONS,
MR. SPOCK?

180
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,689
NONE, CAPTAIN.
YEOMAN TAMURA?

181
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,648
SIR?

182
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,858
TRICORDER READINGS--

183
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,985
RADIATION DISTURBANCES
OF ANY KIND.

184
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,570
[BUZZING]

185
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,367
WORKING, SIR.
NO EVIDENCE.

186
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,828
MEA...

187
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,040
IF THIS IS AN ATTACK,

188
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,377
MAY I ASK WHAT WEAPONS
THE ENEMY IS USING?

189
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,753
FUSION BOMBS,

190
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,797
MATERIALIZED BY THE ENEMY
OVER THEIR TARGETS.

191
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,801
KIRK TO BRIDGE.
SCOTTY?

192
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,762
SCOTT HERE, CAPTAIN.

193
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,847
SCANNERS OPERATIVE
ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE?

194
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,225
OF COURSE, SIR.
AS PER ORDERS.

195
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,269
ANYTHING UNUSUAL?

196
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,644
NOTHING, SIR.

197
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,439
ALL QUIET.

198
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,943
THANK YOU.
KIRK OUT.

199
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,986
LOOK, ANAN.

200
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,322
YES, I SEE IT.

201
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,657
THEY WERE WARNED.

202
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,326
JUST AS IT HAPPENED
50 YEARS AGO.

203
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,162
ALERT A SECURITY
DETACHMENT.

204
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,623
THEY MAY BE NEEDED.

205
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,341
IT WAS
A VICIOUS ATTACK--

206
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,927
EXTREMELY DESTRUCTIVE.

207
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,221
FORTUNATELY,
OUR DEFENSES ARE FIRMING,

208
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,889
BUT OUR CASUALTIES
ARE HIGH--

209
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:40,557
VERY HIGH.

210
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,977
SIR, I HAVE BEEN
IN CONTACT WITH MY SHIP,

211
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:48,523
WHICH HAS HAD
THIS ENTIRE PLANET
UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

212
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,027
ALL DURING THIS...
SO-CALLED ATTACK,

213
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,279
WE HAVE BEEN
MONITORING.

214
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,156
THERE'S BEEN
NO ATTACK,

215
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,324
NO EXPLOSIONS,
NO RADIATIONS,

216
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,951
NO DISTURBANCES
WHATSOEVER.

217
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,995
IF THIS IS
SOME SORT OF GAME
YOU'RE PLAYING--

218
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,622
THIS IS NO GAME,
CAPTAIN.

219
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,083
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE
HAVE JUST BEEN KILLED.

220
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,376
ACTIVATE THE ATTACK
UNITS, SAR.

221
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,377
YES, COUNCILMAN.

222
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,422
LAUNCH IMMEDIATE
COUNTERATTACK.

223
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,591
COMPUTERS, CAPTAIN.

224
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,385
THEY FIGHT THEIR WAR
WITH COMPUTERS TOTALLY.

225
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,637
YES, OF COURSE.

226
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,643
COMPUTERS DON'T KILL
A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE.

227
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,644
DEATHS HAVE
BEEN REGISTERED.

228
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,438
OF COURSE, THEY HAVE
24 HOURS TO REPORT.

229
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,730
TO REPORT?

230
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,526
TO OUR DISINTEGRATION
MACHINES.

231
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,986
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND,
CAPTAIN,

232
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,032
WE HAVE BEEN AT WAR
FOR 500 YEARS.

233
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,451
UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS,

234
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,453
NO CIVILIZATION
COULD WITHSTAND THAT,

235
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,413
BUT WE HAVE REACHED
A SOLUTION.

236
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,124
THEN THE ATTACK
BY VENDIKAR
WAS THEORETICAL.

237
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,544
OH, NO. QUITE REAL.

238
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,171
AN ATTACK IS
MATHEMATICALLY LAUNCHED.

239
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,342
I LOST MY WIFE
IN THE LAST ATTACK.

240
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,345
OUR CIVILIZATION LIVES.

241
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,762
THE PEOPLE DIE,

242
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,057
BUT OUR CULTURE
GOES ON.

243
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,107
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME...

244
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,944
YOUR PEOPLE JUST WALK INTO
A DISINTEGRATION MACHINE

245
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,572
WHEN THEY'RE TOLD TO?

246
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,824
WE HAVE A HIGH
CONSCIOUSNESS OF
DUTY, CAPTAIN.

247
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,035
THERE IS A CERTAIN
SCIENTIFIC LOGIC
ABOUT IT.

248
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,412
I'M GLAD YOU APPROVE.

249
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:29,957
I DO NOT APPROVE.
I UNDERSTAND.

250
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,043
GOOD.

251
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,503
AND YOU WILL RECALL,

252
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,422
I WARNED YOU
NOT TO COME HERE.

253
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,756
YOU CHOSE
TO IGNORE MY WARNING.

254
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,301
I'M SORRY,
BUT IT'S HAPPENED.

255
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,095
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?

256
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,682
ONCE YOUR SHIP WAS IN ORBIT
ABOUT OUR PLANET,

257
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,517
IT BECAME
A LEGITIMATE TARGET.

258
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,310
IT HAS BEEN
CLASSIFIED DESTROYED

259
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,605
BY A TRICOBALT
SATELLITE EXPLOSION.

260
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,861
ALL PERSONS
ABOARD YOUR SHIP

261
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,574
HAVE 24 HOURS TO REPORT
TO OUR DISINTEGRATION
MACHINES.

262
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,535
IN ORDER TO ENSURE
THEIR COOPERATION,

263
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,037
I HAVE ORDERED YOU,
CAPTAIN, AND YOUR PARTY

264
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,331
HELD IN CUSTODY
UNTIL THEY SURRENDER.

265
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,797
IF POSSIBLE, WE SHALL
SPARE YOUR SHIP, CAPTAIN,

266
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,135
BUT ITS PASSENGERS AND CREW
ARE ALREADY DEAD.

267
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,604
CAPTAIN'S LOG, DELAYED.

268
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:36,316
THE "ENTERPRISE,"
IN ORBIT ABOUT EMINIAR VII,

269
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,526
HAS BEEN DECLARED
A CASUALTY

270
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:42,071
OF AN INCREDIBLE WAR
FOUGHT BY COMPUTERS.

271
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,657
I AND MY LANDING PARTY,

272
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:44,991
THOUGH APPARENTLY
NOT INCLUDED

273
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,993
AS CASUALTIES
ABOARD THE ENTERPRISE,

274
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,664
ARE CONFINED
ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE

275
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,332
AWAITING...

276
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,083
WHAT?

277
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,047
I HAVE BEEN SENT
TO ASK IF YOU
REQUIRE ANYTHING.

278
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,215
WE REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL.

279
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,093
I WISH TO SPEAK
TO ANAN 7.

280
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,596
HE IS BUSY COORDINATING
CASUALTY LISTS.

281
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:07,930
HE'LL HAVE MORE
CASUALTY LISTS

282
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,516
THAN HE KNOWS
WHAT TO DO WITH

283
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,434
IF HE DOESN'T GET IN HERE
AND TALK TO ME.

284
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,353
DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND?
OUR DUTY NOW--

285
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,730
YOUR DUTY
DOESN'T INCLUDE

286
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,399
STEPPING INTO
A DISINTEGRATOR
AND DISAPPEARING.

287
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,235
I'M AFRAID MINE DOES,
CAPTAIN.

288
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,321
I, TOO, HAVE BEEN
DECLARED A CASUALTY.

289
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,864
I MUST REPORT
TO A DISINTEGRATOR

290
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,157
BY NOON TOMORROW.

291
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,576
IS THAT ALL
IT MEANS TO YOU?

292
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,996
TO REPORT AND DIE?

293
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,957
MY LIFE IS AS DEAR TO ME
AS YOURS IS TO YOU, CAPTAIN.

294
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,501
THEN HOW
CAN YOU STAND--

295
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,379
DON'T YOU SEE?
IF I REFUSE TO REPORT,

296
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,464
AND OTHERS REFUSE,

297
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,341
THEN VENDIKAR
WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE

298
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,342
BUT TO LAUNCH
REAL WEAPONS.

299
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,553
WE WOULD HAVE TO
DO THE SAME

300
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,471
TO DEFEND OURSELVES.

301
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,140
MORE THAN PEOPLE
WOULD DIE THEN.

302
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,727
A WHOLE CIVILIZATION
WOULD BE DESTROYED.

303
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,813
SURELY YOU CAN SEE THAT
OURS IS THE BETTER WAY.

304
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:00,859
NO...I DON'T
SEE THAT AT ALL.

305
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,028
IT'S BEEN OUR WAY
FOR ALMOST 500 YEARS.

306
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,996
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN BRING YOU?

307
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,417
YES. ANON 7.

308
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,812
I TELL YOU, WE SHOULD HAVE
HEARD SOMETHING BY NOW.

309
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,314
AYE, DOCTOR,
THAT WE SHOULD,
BUT WE HAVEN'T,

310
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,192
AND WE CANNOT
RAISE THEM.

311
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,611
NOW, IF THERE'D
BEEN TROUBLE,

312
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:45,236
THEY SHOULD HAVE
AT LEAST MANAGED

313
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,946
TO GET WORD
BACK TO US.

314
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,531
WE CAN'T JUST SIT HERE.

315
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,366
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST?

316
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,868
ME? I'M A DOCTOR.

317
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,327
IF I WERE AN OFFICER
OF THE LINE, I'D--

318
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,079
WOULD YOU HAVE ME
OPEN FIRE?

319
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,330
OF COURSE NOT.

320
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,375
MR. SCOTT,
MESSAGE COMING IN
FROM THE CAPTAIN.

321
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,418
SCOTT HERE,
CAPTAIN.

322
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,462
Kirk's voice:
GOOD NEWS, MR. SCOTT.

323
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,255
THE EMINIANS HAVE AGREED
TO THE ESTABLISHMENT

324
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,173
OF FULL NORMAL
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.

325
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,093
MR. FOX WILL BE GLAD
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.

326
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,720
THEY'VE ALSO EXTENDED
AN INVITATION

327
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,096
TO ALL PERSONNEL
TO COME ASHORE
FOR SHORE LEAVE.

328
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,973
THEY'VE ASSURED ME

329
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,476
THAT OUR PEOPLE WILL
HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME.

330
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,519
UH, CAPTAIN?

331
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,146
YES, MR. SCOTT?

332
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,105
ALL PERSONNEL?

333
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,940
ALL PERSONNEL.

334
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,524
WE'LL TRANSPORT UP
TRAINED EMINIANS

335
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,568
TO ASSUME
SUPPORT POSITIONS.

336
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,072
THOSE ARE MY ORDERS,
MR. SCOTT.

337
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,074
AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.

338
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,953
WE'LL START FORMING
SHORE PARTIES
IMMEDIATELY.

339
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,287
SCOTT OUT.

340
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,291
WELL, NOW, WHAT DO
YOU THINK OF THAT?

341
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,503
I DON'T KNOW.

342
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,379
WELL, I DO.

343
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,134
COMPUTER,

344
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,513
LAST MESSAGE
RECEIVED AND RECORDED
FROM CAPTAIN KIRK.

345
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,515
[COMPUTER WHIRS]

346
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,182
IN PLACE.

347
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,434
RUN IT THROUGH ANALYZER.

348
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,856
QUESTION--
IS IT OR IS IT NOT
THE CAPTAIN'S VOICE?

349
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:04,941
NEGATIVE.

350
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,943
A CLOSE COPY.

351
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,027
A VOICE DUPLICATOR?

352
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,613
98% PROBABILITY.

353
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,409
WELL, THEY'VE GOT THEM,
DOCTOR,

354
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,287
AND NOW THEY'RE TRYING
TO GET US.

355
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,541
ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN DO IT,
MR. SPOCK?

356
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,917
LIMITED
TELEPATHIC ABILITIES

357
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,002
ARE INHERENT
IN VULCANIANS, CAPTAIN.

358
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,962
IT MAY WORK.

359
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,964
IT MAY NOT.

360
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,841
DO YOUR BEST.

361
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,156
THANK YOU, MR. SPOCK.

362
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,199
MY PLEASURE,
CAPTAIN.

363
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,701
WHAT DO WE DO NOW,
CAPTAIN?

364
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,827
WE GET OUR
COMMUNICATORS BACK

365
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:40,912
AND TRY AND CONTACT
THE SHIP.

366
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,164
MR. SPOCK,

367
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,125
WE'LL NEED MORE WEAPONS.

368
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,585
I UNDERSTAND.

369
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,503
WE'LL TRY TO TAKE IT EASY,

370
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,631
BUT IF WE'RE
FORCED TO KILL...

371
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,617
AN ENTRANCE, CAPTAIN,
BUT NO EXIT.

372
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,996
THEY GO IN,
BUT THEY DO NOT COME OUT.

373
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,080
A DISINTEGRATION
MACHINE.

374
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,415
SO I WOULD ASSUME.

375
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,384
MEA!

376
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,552
OH!

377
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,970
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

378
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,638
I'M--I'M GOING--

379
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,597
YOU'RE NOT GOING
IN THERE.

380
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:24,724
WELL, I MUST.
NO,
YOU'RE NOT.

381
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,310
PLEASE--DON'T
WORRY ABOUT ME.

382
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,104
MR. SPOCK, THAT GUARD.

383
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,400
I'LL COVER YOU.

384
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,370
SIR, THERE'S
A MULTILEGGED CREATURE

385
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,621
CRAWLING ON YOUR SHOULDER.

386
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,353
ALL RIGHT, YOU PEOPLE,
CLEAR OUT OF THE WAY.

387
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,151
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

388
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,113
THROWING A MONKEY WRENCH
INTO THE MACHINERY.

389
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:20,947
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

390
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,949
I'VE DONE IT.

391
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,623
COME ON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

392
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,042
Man: THE FEDERATION
PRISONERS HAVE ATTACKED
THEIR GUARD AND ESCAPED.

393
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,169
THEY ARE ARMED.

394
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,589
DISINTEGRATION STATION
NUMBER 12 DESTROYED,
COUNCILMAN,

395
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,217
APPARENTLY
BY DISRUPTOR FIRE.

396
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,972
ALL SECURITY PERSONNEL,

397
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,015
FEDERATION PRISONERS
HAVE ESCAPED.

398
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,017
THEY ARE TO BE FOUND.

399
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,602
THEY ARE ARMED.

400
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,230
IF THEY RESIST,
DO WHAT IS NECESSARY.

401
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,567
PLANETARY DISRUPTOR BANKS,

402
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,655
CALCULATE ORBIT OF
STARCRUISER NOW CIRCLING.

403
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,116
STAND BY TO FIRE
FULL POWER.

404
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,996
Computer: COUNCILMAN,
PLANETARY DISRUPTOR BANKS
LOCKED ONTO TARGET.

405
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,832
STANDING BY.

406
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,502
IN 10 SECONDS,
OPEN FIRE.

407
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,588
DESTROY THE STARCRUISER.

408
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,217
THOSE ARE THE ORDERS
OF THE COUNCIL.

409
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,139
Scotty: SHIP'S LOG.

410
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,057
STARDATE 3193.0--

411
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,059
CHIEF ENGINEER SCOTT
RECORDING.

412
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,686
THE CAPTAIN
AND FIRST OFFICER

413
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,940
ARE OVERDUE AND MISSING
ON THE SURFACE OF EMINIAR 7.

414
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,692
I HAVE TAKEN STANDARD
PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES

415
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,153
WHILE WE CONTINUE OUR
ATTEMPTS TO LOCATE THEM.

416
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,030
ALL STATIONS REPORTING.

417
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,115
DEFLECTOR SCREENS
RIGGED AT FULL POWER.

418
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,075
PHASER CREWS READY.

419
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,036
SENSORS READING 0.

420
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,079
CORRECTION.
MR. SCOTT.

421
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,664
YES, MR. DePAUL?

422
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,292
SENSOR READINGS JUST
SHOT OFF THE SCALE.

423
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:04,842
WELL, NOW...

424
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,053
THEY'RE TAKING
POTSHOTS AT US.

425
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,097
HOLDING, MR. DePAUL?

426
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,974
SCREENS FIRM, SIR.

427
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,310
EXTREMELY POWERFUL
SONIC VIBRATIONS.

428
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,104
DECIBELS--
18 TO THE 12th POWER.

429
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,106
IF THOSE SCREENS
WEREN'T UP,

430
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,608
WE'D BE TOTALLY
DISRUPTED BY NOW.

431
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,362
I GUESS THAT ANSWERS
OUR QUESTIONS,
MR. SCOTT.

432
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,906
THEY'RE NOT
VERY FRIENDLY,
ARE THEY?

433
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,448
AYE.

434
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,117
BUT WHAT ABOUT
OUR CAPTAIN

435
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,494
AND THE LANDING PARTY
DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE?

436
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,205
WE GET THEM OUT.

437
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,958
IF THEY'RE ALIVE
AND IF WE CAN FIND THEM.

438
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,835
THAT'S A BIG PLANET.

439
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,920
NOT TOO BIG FOR
THE "ENTERPRISE"
TO HANDLE

440
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,504
IF IT HAS TO.

441
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,007
WE CAN'T FIRE FULL PHASERS
WITH OUR SCREENS UP.

442
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,344
WE CAN'T LOWER OUR SCREENS
WITH THEIR DISRUPTORS
ON US.

443
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,427
OF COURSE,
I COULD TREAT THEM

444
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,139
TO A FEW DOZEN
PHOTON TORPEDOES.

445
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,307
YOU WILL DO
NO SUCH THING,
MR. SCOTT.

446
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,768
MR. FOX,
WE'RE UNDER ATTACK.

447
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:56,434
THEY'RE TRYING
TO KNOCK US DOWN.

448
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,396
YOU HAVE TAKEN
DEFENSIVE MEASURES.

449
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,730
OF COURSE, BUT--

450
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,315
THERE ARE NO BUTS.

451
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,983
OBVIOUSLY IT'S
A MISUNDERSTANDING,

452
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,319
AND ONE OF MY JOBS
IS TO CLEAR UP
MISUNDERSTANDINGS.

453
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,571
THEY'RE HOLDING
OUR CAPTAIN.

454
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,614
WE HAVE NO PROOF
OF THAT.

455
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,533
I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE SAFETY OF THIS SHIP.

456
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,911
AND I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE SUCCESS
OF THIS MISSION,

457
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,164
AND THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THIS SHIP.
IS THAT CLEAR?

458
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,457
WE CAME HERE TO ESTABLISH
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

459
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,752
BUT THEY'RE THE ONES
THAT ARE LOOKING FOR
A FIGHT, MR. FOX.

460
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,254
THIS IS
A DIPLOMATIC MATTER.

461
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,006
IF YOU'LL CHECK
YOUR REGULATIONS,

462
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,175
YOU'LL FIND THAT
MY ORDERS GET PRIORITY.

463
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,343
I'LL TRY
TO MAKE CONTACT

464
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,929
WITH THE PLANETARY
OFFICIALS.

465
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,597
LIEUTENANT,
OPEN UP A CHANNEL
AND KEEP IT OPEN.

466
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:38,144
TELL THEM TO EXPECT
A PRIORITY-1 MESSAGE FROM ME.

467
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,729
THERE WILL BE NO PUNITIVE
MEASURES, GENTLEMEN.

468
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,315
THOSE ARE MY ORDERS.

469
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:47,861
DIPLOMATS.

470
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,822
THE BEST DIPLOMAT I KNOW

471
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,616
IS A FULLY-ACTIVATED
PHASER BANK.

472
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,455
WHY DID WE COME BACK HERE,
CAPTAIN?

473
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,123
THE LAST PLACE
THEY'LL LOOK
FOR US

474
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,166
IS THE PLACE
WE ESCAPED FROM.

475
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,417
COVER THE DOOR.

476
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,084
CAPTAIN, YOU HAVE GOT
TO LET ME GO.

477
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,919
MY TIME IS ALMOST UP.

478
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,045
ARE YOU THAT ANXIOUS
TO DIE?

479
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,797
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

480
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,466
MR. SPOCK,
HOW DID THAT
LITTLE RAID WORK OUT?

481
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,884
WE CAPTURED 4 OF THEIR
DISRUPTOR-TYPE WEAPONS,

482
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,803
TWO COMPLETE OUTFITS
OF MALE CLOTHING,

483
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,888
AND, PERHAPS
MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL,

484
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,224
ONE OF THEIR
COMMUNICATION DEVICES.

485
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,725
WILL IT REACH THE SHIP?

486
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:19,685
NOT AT THIS TIME.

487
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,770
ITS RANGE IS RESTRICTED
IN COMPARISON WITH OURS.

488
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,397
I MAY BE ABLE TO ALTER
ITS COMPONENTS,

489
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,690
BUT IT WILL
TAKE TIME.

490
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,442
GET TO WORK ON IT.
WE'VE GOT TO CONTACT
THE SHIP.

491
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,153
MEA, I WANT YOU
TO GIVE ME
A COMPLETE LAYOUT

492
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,612
OF THIS BUILDING COMPLEX.

493
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,614
HOW DO I GET
TO THE WAR ROOM?
NO.

494
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,074
NOW, LISTEN TO ME.

495
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,035
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU,

496
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,411
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE

497
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,788
AND THE LIVES OF
MILLIONS LIKE YOU.

498
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,124
IF YOU HELP ME,
MAYBE I CAN DO IT.

499
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,251
IF YOU DON'T,
YOU'LL DIE,

500
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,337
WE'LL DIE, AND THE KILLING
WILL GO ON--

501
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,173
OR ARE YOU THAT FOND
OF THE WAR?

502
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,092
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

503
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:56,638
WE'RE GOING TO TRY
AND STOP THE KILLING.

504
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,058
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP.

505
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,767
BELIEVE ME.

506
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,316
I BELIEVE YOU, BUT--

507
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,819
TELL ME
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.

508
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,654
PLEASE.

509
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,284
TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

510
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,913
WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE
TO DESTROY THE EARTH SHIP,

511
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,706
ONE OF OUR
DISINTEGRATION CHAMBERS

512
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,291
HAS BEEN ELIMINATED,

513
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,337
AND WE HAVE ALREADY FALLEN
FAR BEHIND IN OUR QUOTA.

514
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,297
THIS IS A GRAVE CRISIS,

515
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,259
AND I AM AT A LOSS
TO KNOW HOW TO PROCEED.

516
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,177
THE CENTRAL CHANNEL,
ANAN.

517
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,678
THE EARTH
AMBASSADOR'S CALLING

518
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,556
WITH
AN URGENT MESSAGE.

519
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,726
WHAT IS
THE GREATER MORALITY,

520
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,311
OPEN HONESTY

521
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:48,524
OR A DECEPTION
WHICH MAY SAVE OUR LIVES?

522
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:53,695
PUT ME THROUGH
TO THE EARTH AMBASSADOR.

523
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,410
A CHANNEL IS OPEN,
MR. AMBASSADOR.

524
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,619
YOU WILL BE SPEAKING
TO ANAN 7,

525
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,790
HEAD OF THE HIGH COUNCIL
OF THE EMINIAN UNION.

526
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,542
[BEEP]

527
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,212
MR. ANAN,
THIS IS ROBERT FOX,

528
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,299
SPECIAL AMBASSADOR FOR THE
UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS.

529
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,301
A GREAT HONOR,
MR. AMBASSADOR.

530
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,928
WE HAVE
APPROACHED YOU OPENLY,

531
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,140
WITH THE INTENT
OF ESTABLISHING FORMAL
AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS

532
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,100
BETWEEN OUR PEOPLES,

533
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,019
BUT NOW, FOR SOME REASON,
YOU HAVE ATTACKED US,

534
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:30,316
AND APPARENTLY
YOU'RE HOLDING SEVERAL
SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVES

535
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,817
OF OUR FEDERATION.

536
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:32,943
A MISTAKE,
MR. AMBASSADOR.

537
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,195
WE ARE AT WAR.

538
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,905
AN ERROR IN OUR SENSORS

539
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,866
INDICATED THAT YOUR SHIP
WAS ABOUT TO ATTACK US.

540
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,161
I AM GIVING ORDERS THAT
OUR ATTACK BE STOPPED.

541
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,455
NOW, AS TO
YOUR REPRESENTATIVES,

542
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,291
YOU HAVE MY SACRED WORD
AS AN EMINIAN

543
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,126
THAT THEY ARE
ALIVE AND WELL.

544
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,294
THANK YOU.

545
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,340
I THOUGHT PERHAPS
IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE.

546
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:58,051
MR. SCOTT,
DISRUPTOR BEAMS ARE
NO LONGER HITTING US.

547
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,638
MAINTAIN STATUS,
MR. DePAUL.

548
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:05,559
WE ARE MOST ANXIOUS
TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS
WITH YOU, MR. FOX.

549
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:08,312
WE WILL MAKE
ARRANGEMENTS
TO RECEIVE YOU.

550
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,981
THE MINUTE THEIR SCREENS
ARE DOWN, OPEN FIRE.

551
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,732
YES, COUNCILMAN.

552
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,278
I APOLOGIZE DEEPLY FOR
THE MISUNDERSTANDING.

553
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:20,073
THESE ARE TRYING TIMES
FOR US, YOU UNDERSTAND.

554
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,241
I UNDERSTAND.

555
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,327
MR. ANAN, I PRESUME

556
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,703
THAT YOU WILL HAVE
OUR SHIP'S CAPTAIN ON HAND

557
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,247
WHEN I BEAM DOWN.

558
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,582
HE WILL BE THERE, SIR.

559
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,292
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

560
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,294
I'M SURE THAT FROM
THIS DAY FORWARD,

561
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,920
YOUR PLANET
AND OUR FEDERATION

562
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,297
WILL ATTAIN
THE DEEPEST FRIENDSHIP.

563
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,591
I LOOK FORWARD
TO SEEING YOU.

564
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,387
DIPLOMACY, GENTLEMEN,

565
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:45,849
SHOULD BE
A JOB LEFT TO DIPLOMATS.

566
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,353
YOU WILL, OF COURSE,
IMMEDIATELY RESUME
A PEACEFUL STATUS.

567
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,855
NO, SIR, I WILL NOT.

568
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,399
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

569
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:54,400
I'LL NOT
LOWER THE SCREENS,

570
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,735
NOT UNTIL THE CAPTAIN
TELLS ME TO.

571
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,362
YOU ARE TAKING ORDERS
FROM ME.

572
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,865
YOU WILL LOWER THE
SCREENS AS A SIGN
OF GOOD FAITH.

573
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,824
MY AUTHORITY.

574
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,660
I KNOW ABOUT
YOUR AUTHORITY,

575
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,745
BUT THE SCREENS
STAY UP.

576
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,790
MR. FOX,
THEY FAKED A MESSAGE
FROM THE CAPTAIN,

577
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,918
THEY'VE
LAUNCHED AN ATTACK
AGAINST OUR SHIP.

578
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,920
NOW, YOU WANT US TO
TRUST THEM OPENLY?

579
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,839
I WANT YOU AND EXPECT YOU
TO OBEY MY LAWFUL ORDERS.

580
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,426
NO, SIR. I WON'T
LOWER THE SCREENS.

581
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,928
YOUR REFUSAL TO COMPLY
WITH MY ORDERS

582
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,556
HAS ENDANGERED THE ENTIRE
SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION!

583
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,807
I CAN HAVE YOU SENT
TO A PENAL COLONY FOR THIS.

584
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,936
THAT YOU CAN, SIR,
BUT I WON'T
LOWER THE SCREENS.

585
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,938
YOUR NAME
WILL FIGURE PROMINENTLY

586
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:36,442
IN MY REPORT
TO THE FEDERATION CENTRAL.

587
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,910
WELL, SCOTTY,
NOW YOU'VE DONE IT.

588
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,329
AYE. THE HAGGIS IS
IN THE FIRE FOR SURE,

589
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,956
BUT I'LL NOT
LOWER MY DEFENSES

590
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,251
ON THE WORD OF THAT
MEALY-MOUTHED GENTLEMAN
DOWN BELOW,

591
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,796
NOT UNTIL I KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE CAPTAIN.

592
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,227
WON'T YOU JOIN ME
IN A DRINK, CAPTAIN?

593
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,522
YOU'LL FIND OUR TROVA
MOST INTERESTING.

594
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,776
I DIDN'T COME TO DRINK.

595
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,404
I ASSUME
THAT IS WHAT YOU USED

596
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,364
TO DESTROY
DISINTEGRATION CHAMBER 12.

597
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,825
A VERY EFFICIENT WEAPON.
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF USING IT.

598
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,536
MY FIRST IMPRESSION
WAS CORRECT.

599
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,624
YOU ARE A BARBARIAN.

600
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,585
I AM?

601
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,714
DON'T SOUND
SO INCREDULOUS, CAPTAIN.

602
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,341
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

603
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,676
WE ALL ARE.

604
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,636
A KILLER FIRST,
A BUILDER SECOND.

605
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:49,348
A HUNTER, A WARRIOR,
AND--LET'S BE HONEST--

606
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,557
A MURDERER.

607
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,727
THAT IS OUR JOINT HERITAGE,
IS IT NOT?

608
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,689
WE'RE A LITTLE LESS
COLD-BLOODED ABOUT IT
THAN YOU ARE.

609
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:59,149
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
CAPTAIN?

610
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,530
I WANT TO
CONTACT MY SHIP.

611
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,535
WHERE ARE
MY COMMUNICATORS?

612
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,204
IN A SAFE PLACE.

613
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,623
YOU TAKE A LOT OF
CHANCES, COUNCILMAN.

614
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,543
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
YOUR SHIP, CAPTAIN.

615
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,628
I'M TRYING
TO SAVE A WORLD.

616
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,214
IF I WERE YOU,

617
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,551
I'D THINK ABOUT
SAVING MY LIFE.

618
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,596
WON'T YOU HAVE A DRINK,
CAPTAIN?

619
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,870
AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS
OUR DIFFERENCES.

620
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,789
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN DISCUSSING
OUR DIFFERENCES.

621
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,209
YOU DON'T SEEM TO
REALIZE THE RISK
YOU'RE TAKING.

622
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,003
WE DON'T MAKE WAR
WITH COMPUTERS

623
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:06,299
AND HERD THE CASUALTIES
INTO SUICIDE STATIONS.

624
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:10,721
WE MAKE THE REAL THING,
COUNCILMAN.

625
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,890
I COULD DESTROY
THIS PLANET.

626
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,350
WHY DO YOU THINK
I DON'T LET YOU
TALK TO YOUR SHIP?

627
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:19,271
I DON'T NEED THE SHIP
FOR THAT.

628
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:23,692
YOU MEAN,
ALL BY YOURSELF,
WITH A DISRUPTOR,

629
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,151
YOU CAN DESTROY
THIS PLANET?

630
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,862
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I MEAN.

631
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:30,741
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE
SO...FORMIDABLE.

632
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,158
YOU SEEM TO THINK
I'M JOKING.

633
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,536
WHERE ARE
THE COMMUNICATORS?

634
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,877
IF I TOLD YOU,
CAPTAIN,

635
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,671
WOULD YOU
WALK RIGHT OUT
AND GET THEM?

636
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,340
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

637
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,216
VERY WELL, CAPTAIN.

638
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,844
THEY'RE IN THE WAR ROOM.

639
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,680
GO LEFT,
DOWN THE CORRIDOR,
LEFT AGAIN.

640
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,515
THEY ARE UNGUARDED.

641
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,597
IS HE ALIVE?

642
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,773
PITY.

643
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:48,443
A MAN LIKE THAT WOULD'VE...
PREFERRED TO DIE FIGHTING.

644
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,570
TAKE HIM
TO THE COUNCIL ROOM.

645
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:24,980
AMBASSADOR FOX?

646
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,983
I AM ROBERT FOX.

647
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,527
HAVE I THE HONOR
OF ADDRESSING
ANAN 7?

648
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:34,948
WELCOME TO EMINIAR,
MR. AMBASSADOR.

649
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,207
UH, MR. AMBASSADOR,

650
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,794
I AM TRULY SORRY FOR
WHAT MUST HAPPEN.

651
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,171
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

652
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,508
YOU AND YOUR PARTY
HAVE BEEN DECLARED
WAR CASUALTIES.

653
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,386
YOU'LL BE TAKEN
IMMEDIATELY TO ONE OF
OUR CASUALTY STATIONS

654
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,097
SO THAT YOUR DEATHS
MAY BE RECORDED.

655
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,937
YOU MEAN...
WE ARE TO BE KILLED?

656
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,230
THAT IS CORRECT,
MR. AMBASSADOR.

657
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,274
I REGRET IT
VERY MUCH,

658
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,568
BUT THERE IS NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

659
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,828
[BEEPING]

660
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,039
SPOCK TO "ENTERPRISE."
COME IN.

661
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,833
MR. SCOTT,
IT'S MR. SPOCK.

662
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,461
SCOTTY HERE,
MR. SPOCK. GO AHEAD.

663
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,379
IS THE SHIP
ALL RIGHT?

664
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,381
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
A BIT, BUT WE'RE
ALL RIGHT NOW.

665
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,800
HOW ABOUT
THE CAPTAIN AND YOU?

666
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,259
THE CAPTAIN IS OVERDUE.

667
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,428
WE'VE SUFFERED
NO CASUALTIES AMONG US.

668
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,305
THIS IS IMPORTANT--

669
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,892
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
SHALL ANYONE BEAM DOWN
FROM THE "ENTERPRISE."

670
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,227
THEY'D BE KILLED
THE MOMENT THEY ARRIVED.

671
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,981
THAT TIES IT. THAT
POPINJAY FOX WENT DOWN
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO.

672
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,190
THE AMBASSADOR.

673
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,442
I KNEW IT HAD
A ROTTEN RING TO IT.

674
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,402
ORBIT OUT TO MAXIMUM
PHASER RANGE

675
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,780
AND STAND BY
FOR FURTHER ORDERS.

676
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,032
SPOCK OUT.

677
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,833
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, MR. SPOCK?

678
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,127
FIND THE AMBASSADOR
AND THE CAPTAIN.

679
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,338
YEOMAN TAMURA,
YOU STAY HERE

680
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,133
AND PREVENT
THIS YOUNG LADY
FROM IMMOLATING HERSELF.

681
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,468
KNOCK HER DOWN
AND SIT ON HER
IF NECESSARY.

682
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,594
THIS IS A KILLING
SITUATION.

683
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,763
DO WHAT YOU MUST
TO PROTECT YOURSELF.
CLEAR?

684
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,473
YES, SIR.

685
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,365
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

686
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,284
I'M A REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE UNITED FEDERATION
OF PLANETS!

687
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,536
A SPECIAL
REPRESENTATIVE!

688
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:45,620
GET IN LINE.

689
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,168
SPOCK!

690
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,711
PLEASE, MR. FOX.

691
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:55,172
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE MOVE QUICKLY AWAY
FROM THE CHAMBER,

692
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,590
OR YOU MAY BE INJURED.

693
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,801
[BEEPING]

694
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,180
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
MR. SPOCK?

695
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,474
PRACTICING
A PECULIAR VARIETY
OF DIPLOMACY, SIR.

696
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,983
I'LL TAKE YOU TO A PLACE
OF COMPARATIVE SAFETY.

697
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,735
THEN I MUST
FIND THE CAPTAIN.

698
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,695
THEY HAVE HIM.
THE GUARDS TOLD US.

699
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,656
THEY TOOK HIM
TO THE COUNCIL ROOM
UNDER HEAVY GUARD.

700
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,701
BY NOW, MR. AMBASSADOR,
I'M SURE YOU REALIZE

701
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,662
THAT NORMAL
DIPLOMATIC PROCEDURES
ARE INEFFECTIVE HERE.

702
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,123
I'VE NEVER BEEN
A SOLDIER, MR. SPOCK,

703
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,750
BUT I LEARN
VERY QUICKLY.

704
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,586
VERY WELL, SIR. WE NEED
ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET.

705
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:48,558
Anan 7: CAPTAIN,
SURELY YOU CAN SEE
THE POSITION WE ARE IN.

706
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,687
IF YOUR PEOPLE
DO NOT REPORT TO OUR
DISINTEGRATION CHAMBERS,

707
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,440
IT IS A VIOLATION
OF AN AGREEMENT

708
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,525
THAT DATES BACK
500 YEARS.

709
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,361
MY PEOPLE
ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR AGREEMENTS.

710
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,696
YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE

711
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,283
FOR AN ESCALATION
THAT WILL DESTROY
EVERYTHING.

712
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,619
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
HORRIBLY KILLED,

713
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,455
COMPLETE DESTRUCTION
OF OUR CULTURE HERE--

714
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,707
YES, AND THE CULTURE
ON VENDIKAR--

715
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,919
DISASTER, DISEASE,
STARVATION,

716
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,296
HORRIBLE,
LINGERING DEATH,

717
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,173
PAIN AND ANGUISH!

718
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,342
THAT SEEMS
TO FRIGHTEN YOU.

719
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,511
IT WOULD FRIGHTEN
ANY SANE MAN.

720
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:29,266
YES. YOU'RE
QUITE RIGHT.

721
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,060
DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND, CAPTAIN?

722
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,353
WE HAVE DONE AWAY
WITH ALL THAT.

723
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,941
NOW YOU ARE THREATENING
TO BRING IT DOWN
ON US AGAIN.

724
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:41,444
ARE THOSE 500 PEOPLE
OF YOURS

725
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,157
MORE IMPORTANT THAN
THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
OF INNOCENT PEOPLE

726
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:47,533
ON EMINIAR AND VENDIKAR?

727
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,661
WHAT KIND OF MONSTER
ARE YOU?

728
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,537
I'M A BARBARIAN.

729
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,790
YOU SAID IT
YOURSELF.

730
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,417
I HAD HOPED I HAD SPOKEN
ONLY FIGURATIVELY.

731
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,920
OH, NO. YOU WERE
QUITE ACCURATE.

732
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,339
I PLAN
TO PROVE IT TO YOU.

733
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,595
OPEN A CHANNEL
TO THE "ENTERPRISE."

734
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,270
YOU GIVE ME NO CHOICE,
CAPTAIN.

735
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,479
WE ARE NOT BANDITS,

736
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,774
BUT YOU FORCE US
TO ACT AS BANDITS.

737
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:20,775
Scotty: THIS IS
THE U.S.S. "ENTERPRISE."

738
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,904
SCOTTY, GENERAL
ORDER 24 IN 2 HOURS!
IN 2 HOURS!

739
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,451
"ENTERPRISE"...

740
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,411
THIS IS ANAN 7,

741
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,332
FIRST COUNCILMAN
OF THE HIGH COUNCIL
OF EMINIAR.

742
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,583
WE HOLD YOUR CAPTAIN,
HIS PARTY,

743
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,545
YOUR AMBASSADOR,
AND HIS PARTY
PRISONERS.

744
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,840
UNLESS YOU IMMEDIATELY
START TRANSPORTATION

745
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,344
OF ALL PERSONNEL
ABOARD YOUR SHIP
TO THE SURFACE,

746
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,971
THE HOSTAGES
WILL BE KILLED.

747
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,515
YOU HAVE 30 MINUTES.

748
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:01,566
I MEAN IT, CAPTAIN.

749
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,737
ALL THAT MEANS IS THAT

750
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,280
I WON'T BE AROUND
FOR THE DESTRUCTION.

751
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,698
YOU HEARD ME GIVE
GENERAL ORDER 24.

752
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,242
THAT MEANS IN TWO HOURS,

753
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:15,372
THE "ENTERPRISE" WILL
DESTROY EMINIAR VII.

754
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,334
PLANETARY DEFENSE SYSTEM,

755
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,836
OPEN FIRE
ON THE "ENTERPRISE."

756
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,380
I'M SORRY,
COUNCILMAN.

757
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,631
THE TARGET HAS
MOVED OUT OF RANGE.

758
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,597
YOU WOULDN'T DO THIS.

759
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,474
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE.

760
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,353
I DIDN'T START IT,
COUNCILMAN...

761
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,814
BUT I'M LIABLE
TO FINISH IT.

762
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,209
COUNCILMAN, RECEIVED
A MESSAGE FROM VENDIKAR.

763
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,044
OUR TIME IS NEARLY UP.

764
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,255
OUR QUOTA IS SHORT
BY SEVERAL THOUSAND.

765
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,091
THEY ACCUSE US
OF RENEGING
ON THE TREATY.

766
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,008
YOU SEE?

767
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,010
IT'S STARTED.

768
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,178
YOU'RE WRONG.

769
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,639
IT HASN'T BEGUN.

770
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,057
Computer: COUNCILMAN,

771
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,393
DISINTEGRATOR STATION 11
HAS BEEN DESTROYED.

772
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,771
GUARDS POSITIONED
AT TUNNELS 8 AND 10
FAIL TO ANSWER.

773
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,608
EARTH PARTY REPORTED SEEN
IN CORRIDOR 4-A.

774
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,986
YOU HAVE
LESS THAN TWO HOURS,
COUNCILMAN.

775
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:31,530
WHAT I WANT OR DON'T WANT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

776
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,991
ESCALATION IS AUTOMATIC.

777
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,993
YOU CAN STOP IT!

778
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,453
STOP IT?

779
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,580
I'M COUNTING ON IT.

780
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:44,627
OPEN A CHANNEL,
LIEUTENANT.

781
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,672
[BEEP]

782
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,467
THIS IS THE COMMANDER
OF THE U.S.S. "ENTERPRISE."

783
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,387
ALL CITIES AND INSTALLATIONS
ON EMINIAR VII

784
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,555
HAVE BEEN LOCATED,
IDENTIFIED,

785
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,434
AND FED INTO
OUR FIRE CONTROL SYSTEM.

786
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:02,228
IN 1 HOUR AND 45 MINUTES,

787
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,856
THE ENTIRE INHABITED SURFACE
OF YOUR PLANET

788
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,441
WILL BE DESTROYED.

789
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,861
YOU HAVE THAT LONG
TO SURRENDER YOUR HOSTAGES.

790
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,612
WHAT CAN I DO?

791
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,366
SOMEBODY,
PLEASE TELL ME.

792
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,540
HOLD IT!

793
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,542
OVER THERE.

794
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,127
YOU, OVER THERE.

795
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,171
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

796
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,635
NOW WE'LL TALK.

797
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:40,725
I HAD ASSUMED
YOU NEEDED HELP.

798
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,685
I SEE I'M IN ERROR.

799
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,812
NO, I NEED THE HELP.

800
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,647
IN THERE, MR. SPOCK.

801
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,075
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

802
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,410
COME IN, SCOTTY.

803
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:00,245
AYE, CAPTAIN.,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

804
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,706
EVERYTHING'S
SECURE HERE.
MAINTAIN POSITION.

805
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,083
IF EVERYTHING GOES
ACCORDING TO PLAN,

806
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,751
YOU CAN BEAM US UP
IN 10 MINUTES.

807
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,170
IF YOU DON'T HEAR FROM US,

808
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,424
CARRY OUT GENERAL ORDER 24
ON SCHEDULE.

809
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:13,758
AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.

810
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,552
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
WE CAN DO?

811
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,554
CROSS YOUR FINGERS.

812
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,180
KIRK OUT.

813
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,017
DEATH...

814
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,478
DESTRUCTION,
DISEASE, HORROR...

815
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:30,442
THAT'S WHAT WAR
IS ALL ABOUT, ANAN.

816
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:33,486
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
A THING TO BE AVOIDED.

817
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,072
YOU'VE MADE IT
NEAT AND PAINLESS--

818
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,991
SO NEAT AND PAINLESS,

819
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,619
YOU'VE HAD NO REASON
TO STOP IT.

820
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,913
AND YOU'VE HAD IT
FOR 500 YEARS.

821
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,915
SINCE IT SEEMS TO BE
THE ONLY WAY

822
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,461
I CAN SAVE
MY CREW AND MY SHIP,

823
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:51,963
I'M GOING TO
END IT FOR YOU,

824
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,299
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

825
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,008
MR. AMBASSADOR.

826
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,635
YES, CAPTAIN.

827
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,971
WOULD YOU MIND TAKING THESE
PEOPLE OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR

828
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:01,264
AND HOLDING THEM THERE?

829
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,642
GENTLEMEN,
IF YOU PLEASE.

830
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,727
YOU...

831
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,062
COME WITH ME.

832
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,272
MR. OSBORNE.

833
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,237
OUR COMMUNICATORS,
WEAPONS.

834
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,582
ALL RIGHT, MR. SPOCK.

835
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,959
THESE ARE
THE ATTACK COMPUTERS,
CAPTAIN.

836
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,628
THAT ONE'S DEFENSE,

837
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,712
THAT ONE
COMPUTES THE CASUALTIES.

838
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,590
THEY'RE ALL TIED IN
WITH A SUBSPACE
TRANSMISSION UNIT

839
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,550
WHICH KEEPS THEM
IN CONSTANT CONTACT

840
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,968
WITH THEIR VENDIKAN
COUNTERPARTS.

841
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,678
YES, GO ON.

842
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,555
THE MOMENT
CONTACT IS BROKEN,

843
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,474
IT ABROGATES
THE AGREEMENT

844
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:45,933
BETWEEN THE TWO
WARRING PARTIES.

845
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,186
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

846
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,312
THIS ONE'S THE KEY.

847
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:52,023
THE CIRCUIT
IS NOW LOCKED.

848
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,900
DESTROY THIS ONE,
AND THEY'LL ALL GO.

849
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,528
GOOD. GET HIM
OUT OF HERE.

850
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:59,155
NO. WAIT A MINUTE!
PLEASE, PLEASE!

851
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:08,206
LET'S GO.

852
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,418
AGAINST THE WALLS!

853
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,892
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE?

854
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,810
YES, I DO.

855
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,938
I'VE GIVEN YOU BACK
THE HORRORS OF WAR.

856
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,400
THE VENDIKANS WILL
NOW ASSUME THAT YOU'VE
BROKEN YOUR AGREEMENT

857
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,818
AND THAT YOU'RE
PREPARING TO WAGE REAL
WAR WITH REAL WEAPONS.

858
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,362
THEY'LL WANT
TO DO THE SAME,

859
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,906
ONLY THE NEXT ATTACK
THEY LAUNCH

860
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,534
WILL DO A LOT MORE
THAN JUST COUNT UP
NUMBERS IN A COMPUTER.

861
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,704
THEY'LL DESTROY YOUR CITIES,
DEVASTATE YOUR PLANET.

862
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,247
YOU, OF COURSE,
WILL WANT TO RETALIATE.

863
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:52,542
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D START MAKING BOMBS.

864
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:56,003
YES, COUNCILMAN,
YOU HAVE A REAL WAR
ON YOUR HANDS.

865
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,548
YOU CAN EITHER WAGE IT
WITH REAL WEAPONS,

866
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:03,052
OR YOU MIGHT CONSIDER
AN ALTERNATIVE--

867
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,222
PUT AN END TO IT.

868
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,890
MAKE PEACE.

869
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,975
THERE CAN BE NO PEACE.

870
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,561
DON'T YOU SEE?

871
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,605
WE'VE ADMITTED IT
TO OURSELVES.

872
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:14,606
WE'RE A KILLER SPECIES.

873
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:17,108
IT'S INSTINCTIVE.
IT'S THE SAME WITH YOU,

874
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,985
YOUR GENERAL ORDER 24.

875
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,488
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S INSTINCTIVE.

876
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:25,157
BUT THE INSTINCT
CAN BE FOUGHT.

877
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,034
WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS

878
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:31,205
WITH THE BLOOD OF A MILLION
SAVAGE YEARS ON OUR HANDS,

879
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,541
BUT WE CAN STOP IT.

880
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,543
WE CAN ADMIT
THAT WE'RE KILLERS,

881
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,878
BUT WE'RE NOT
GOING TO KILL TODAY.

882
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,171
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES--

883
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:42,550
KNOWING THAT WE'RE NOT
GOING TO KILL TODAY.

884
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,886
CONTACT VENDIKAR.

885
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,430
I THINK YOU'LL FIND

886
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,848
THAT THEY'RE JUST AS
TERRIFIED, APPALLED,

887
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,100
HORRIFIED AS YOU ARE,

888
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,978
THAT THEY'LL DO ANYTHING
TO AVOID THE ALTERNATIVE
I'VE GIVEN YOU.

889
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,689
PEACE OR UTTER DESTRUCTION.

890
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,316
IT'S UP TO YOU.

891
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,944
AS A THIRD PARTY,
INTERESTED ONLY
IN PEACE

892
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,947
AND THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF NORMAL RELATIONS,

893
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,200
I SHOULD BE GLAD TO
OFFER MY SERVICES
AS NEGOTIATOR

894
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,495
BETWEEN YOU
AND VENDIKAR.

895
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,122
I'VE HAD SOME
SMALL EXPERIENCES

896
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,082
IN SUCH MATTERS.

897
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,710
THERE MAY BE A CHANCE.

898
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:22,465
WE HAVE A DIRECT CHANNEL
WITH VENDIKAR'S HIGH COUNCIL.

899
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,258
IT HASN'T BEEN USED
IN CENTURIES.

900
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,178
THEN IT'S
LONG OVERDUE.

901
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,929
SHALL WE GO?

902
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:39,607
THERE'S A CHANCE
IT MAY WORK, CAPTAIN.

903
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,069
KIRK TO
"ENTERPRISE."
SCOTTY?

904
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,571
SCOTT HERE, CAPTAIN.

905
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:48,865
CANCEL IMPLEMENTATION
OF GENERAL ORDER 24.

906
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,785
ALERT TRANSPORTER ROOM.

907
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,537
WE'RE READY TO BEAM UP.

908
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,961
LAY IN A COURSE
FOR ARGANA 2, NAVIGATOR.

909
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:01,920
MR. SCOTT?

910
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,549
SPACE DETAIL SET,
CAPTAIN.

911
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,509
MESSAGE FROM EMINIAR VII,
CAPTAIN.

912
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:10,012
AMBASSADOR FOX REPORTS
NEGOTIATIONS UNDERWAY
WITH VENDIKAR.

913
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,972
OUTLOOK HOPEFUL.

914
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:12,973
GOOD.

915
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,560
CAPTAIN...

916
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:16,561
YOU TOOK
A BIG CHANCE.

917
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:18,771
DID I, MR. SPOCK?

918
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:21,524
THEY HAVE BEEN KILLING
3 MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR.

919
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,234
IT HAD BEEN GOING ON
FOR 500 YEARS.

920
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,528
AN ACTUAL ATTACK
WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED
ANY MORE PEOPLE

921
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,238
THAN ONE OF THEIR
COMPUTER ATTACKS,

922
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,989
BUT IT WOULD'VE
ENDED THEIR ABILITY
TO MAKE WAR.

923
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:32,451
THE FIGHTING WOULD'VE
BEEN OVER PERMANENTLY.

924
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,161
BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
THAT IT WOULD WORK.

925
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,955
NO...

926
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,957
IT WAS A CALCULATED RISK.

927
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,294
STILL, THE EMINIANS KEEP
A VERY ORDERLY SOCIETY,

928
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,508
AND ACTUAL WAR
IS A VERY MESSY BUSINESS--

929
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,094
A VERY, VERY MESSY BUSINESS.

930
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,971
I HAD A FEELING THAT THEY
WOULD DO ANYTHING TO AVOID IT,

931
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,515
EVEN TALK PEACE.

932
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,602
A FEELING IS
NOT MUCH TO GO ON.

933
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,854
SOMETIMES A FEELING,
MR. SPOCK,

934
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,856
IS ALL WE HUMANS
HAVE TO GO ON.

935
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,567
CAPTAIN...

936
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,152
YOU ALMOST MAKE ME
BELIEVE IN LUCK.

937
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,945
WHY, MR. SPOCK,

938
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,574
YOU ALMOST MAKE ME
BELIEVE IN MIRACLES.
