1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,841
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 5730.2.

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,844
THE PLANET ARIANNUS IS VITAL AS
A TRANSFER POINT

3
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:12,095
ON REGULAR SPACE
COMMERCIAL LANES.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,222
IT HAS BEEN ATTACKED BY
A BACTERIAL INVASION

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,391
WHICH THREATENS
TO RENDER IT LIFELESS
UNLESS CHECKED.

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:20,312
OUR MISSION:
TO DECONTAMINATE IT.

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,940
MR. CHEKOV, AN ESTIMATED
TIME OF ARRIVAL
FOR ARIANNUS?

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:27,778
AT PRESENT SPEED,
OUR E.T.A. IS
3 HOURS, 4 MINUTES, SIR.

9
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,990
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
ADVISE THE PLANET'S
MINISTRY OF HEALTH

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,950
THAT WE'LL BEGIN
DECONTAMINATION
PROCEDURES

11
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,035
IMMEDIATELY UPON
LOCKING INTO ORBIT.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,578
AYE-AYE, SIR.

13
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:37,663
SCOTTY, WILL THAT
PRESENT ANY PROBLEMS
FOR YOU?

14
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,999
NONE, SIR.
ALL TANKS ARE BEING
POSITIONED.

15
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,585
CAPTAIN, SENSORS
INDICATE A SPACE VEHICLE
OF SOME SORT AHEAD.

16
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,336
IS IT WITHIN VISUAL RANGE?

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,380
COMING INTO RANGE
NOW, SIR.

18
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,466
IT'S FOLLOWING
A VERY ERRATIC COURSE.

19
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,177
PUT IT ON THE SCREEN,
EXTREME MAGNIFICATION.

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,019
I THINK THAT
MAY BE A STARFLEET
SHUTTLECRAFT, SIR.

21
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,604
THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS, MR. CHEKOV.

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,398
IT LOOKS LIKE THE ONE
REPORTED STOLEN
FROM STARBASE 4

23
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:05,607
2 WEEKS AGO.

24
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,608
LIEUTENANT UHURA,

25
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,319
TRY TO CONTACT THEM ON
COMMAND FREQUENCY 2.

26
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,738
AYE, CAPTAIN.

27
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,789
NO RESPONSE, SIR.

28
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,416
TRY ALL FREQUENCIES.

29
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,919
AYE, SIR. HAILING
ON ALL FREQUENCIES.

30
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:28,005
CAPTAIN, THERE IS ONE
LIVING CREATURE ABOARD.
HUMANOID.

31
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,465
HE IS EITHER INJURED
OR ILL.

32
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,468
THE CRAFT SHOWS INTERNAL
ATMOSPHERIC LEAKAGE.

33
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,888
THE CREATURE MAY BE
SUFFOCATING.

34
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,932
LIEUTENANT SULU,
ACTIVATE TRACTOR BEAMS.

35
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,016
TRACTOR BEAMS
ACTIVATED.

36
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,684
WE HAVE IT, SIR.

37
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,519
PREPARE TO BRING IT
ABOARD THE HANGAR DECK.

38
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,938
AYE, SIR.

39
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:44,646
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
SEND A SECURITY TEAM

40
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,982
TO THE PRESSURE DOORS
ON THE HANGAR DECK.

41
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:47,942
AYE, SIR.

42
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,402
MR. SPOCK, COME WITH ME.
SCOTTY.

43
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,659
Sulu on P.A.:
HANGAR DOORS OPEN AND CLEARING

44
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,369
FOR ENTRANCE OF SHUTTLECRAFT.

45
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,873
SHUTTLECRAFT APPROACHING
HANGAR DECK.

46
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,336
[SHIP'S WHISTLE]

47
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,964
Sulu: BRIDGE TO
CAPTAIN KIRK.

48
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:11,256
KIRK HERE.

49
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,466
HANGAR DOORS
HAVE CLOSED,

50
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,884
AND HANGAR DECK
IS PRESSURIZING.

51
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,928
ACKNOWLEDGED.

52
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,899
WE'LL ENTER AS SOON
AS THE DOORS OPEN,

53
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,151
AND WE'LL GO
ON MY COMMAND.

54
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,661
[HITS FLOOR]

55
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,723
SPACE--THE FINAL FRONTIER.

56
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,816
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES OF
THE STARSHIP<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

57
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:15,154
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION: TO EXPLORE
STRANGE, NEW WORLDS,

58
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:19,282
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS.

59
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,577
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN
HAS GONE BEFORE.

60
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,249
YOU ARE CERTAIN, DOCTOR,
THAT THIS PIGMENTATION

61
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,543
IS THE NATURAL CONDITION
OF THIS INDIVIDUAL?

62
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,379
THAT'S WHAT I'VE RECORDED,
MR. SPOCK.

63
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,673
DO WE HAVE ANY
KNOWLEDGE OF A PLANET

64
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,509
THAT COULD HAVE PRODUCED
SUCH A RACE OF BEINGS?

65
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,427
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.

66
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,637
BONES, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF IT?

67
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,432
WELL, I CAN'T GIVE YOU
ANY SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCE
THAT WILL EXPLAIN HIM.

68
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,226
WELL, JUDGING BY
LOOKING AT HIM,

69
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,269
WE KNOW AT THE VERY
LEAST HE IS THE RESULT

70
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,313
OF A VERY DRAMATIC
CONFLICT. SPOCK?

71
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,191
THERE IS NO THEORY,
CAPTAIN,

72
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,901
FROM THE BASIC WORK
OF MENDEL

73
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,736
TO THE MOST RECENT
NUCLEOTIDE STUDIES,

74
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,529
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN
OUR CAPTIVE.

75
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,200
ALL GRADATIONS OF COLOR
FROM BLACK TO BROWN
TO YELLOW TO WHITE

76
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,202
ARE GENETICALLY
PREDICTABLE.

77
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,371
WE MUST THEREFORE
CONCLUDE THAT
THIS ALIEN

78
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,959
IS THAT OFTEN
UNACCOUNTABLE RARITY,

79
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,878
A MUTATION--
ONE OF A KIND.

80
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,089
YES, I WOULD AGREE
THAT'S THE CASE HERE.

81
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,715
YOUR PROGNOSIS,
DOCTOR?

82
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,341
WELL, I CAN'T
GIVE YOU ONE, JIM.

83
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,053
I'VE NEVER WORKED
ON ANYONE LIKE HIM
OR<i> ANYTHING</i> LIKE HIM.

84
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,847
YET YOU ARE
PUMPING HIM FULL OF
YOUR NOXIOUS POTIONS

85
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,348
AS IF HE WERE A HUMAN.

86
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,228
WHEN IN DOUBT,
THE BOOK PREVAILS,
MR. SPOCK.

87
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,105
I'VE RUN TESTS.
BLOOD IS BLOOD,

88
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,065
EVEN WHEN IT'S GREEN
LIKE YOURS.

89
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,775
THE ORGANS ARE THERE.

90
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,193
THEY'RE REARRANGED
TO A DEGREE,

91
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,445
PLUS A FEW I'VE NEVER
SEEN BEFORE.

92
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,530
I'VE ENRICHED THE OXYGEN
CONTENT OF HIS BLOOD

93
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,660
AND PUMPED IN
A STRONG STIMULANT.

94
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,664
AND I MUST SAY,
HIS RECUPERATIVE POWERS
APPEAR TO BE EXCELLENT.

95
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,167
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
CAPTAIN,

96
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,837
I SHALL DO SOME FURTHER
RESEARCH AND JOIN YOU
ON THE BRIDGE.

97
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,546
HE'S COMING AROUND,
DOCTOR.

98
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,135
WELL...

99
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,053
TOUCH AND GO THERE
FOR A MINUTE,

100
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,889
BUT YOU'RE
OUT OF DANGER NOW.

101
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,353
YOU'RE ABOARD
THE STARSHIP<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

102
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,482
I'VE HEARD OF IT.

103
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,610
IT'S IN THE UNITED
FLEET OF PLANETS?

104
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,487
FEDERATION.

105
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,282
SO WAS THE SHUTTLECRAFT
THAT YOU WERE FLYING IN.

106
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,200
IT WAS?

107
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,203
DON'T YOU USUALLY
KNOW

108
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,038
WHOSE PROPERTY
YOU'VE STOLEN?

109
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,290
I AM NOT A THIEF.

110
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,292
WELL, CERTAINLY
NO ORDINARY THIEF,

111
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,336
CONSIDERING WHAT
IT IS YOU...

112
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,962
APPROPRIATED.

113
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,630
YOU'RE BEING VERY LOOSE
WITH YOUR ACCUSATIONS,

114
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,717
AND DRAWING CONCLUSIONS
WITHOUT ANY FACTS.

115
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,136
WELL, I DO KNOW
THAT YOU MADE OFF

116
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,762
WITH A SHIP THAT
DIDN'T BELONG TO YOU!

117
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,806
I DO NOT MAKE OFF WITH THINGS.

118
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,474
MY NEED GAVE ME THE RIGHT
TO USE THE SHIP.

119
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,519
MARK THE WORD, SIR--
THE USE OF IT.

120
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,105
YOU CAN TRY THOSE
TECHNICAL EVASIONS

121
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,481
ON STARFLEET
COMMAND.

122
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,651
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'LL BE FACING
YOUR CHARGES.

123
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,029
I'M GRATEFUL FOR
YOUR RESCUE.

124
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,447
DON'T MENTION IT.

125
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,408
WE'RE PLEASED TO
HAVE CAUGHT YOU.

126
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,619
WHO ARE YOU?

127
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,830
MY NAME IS LOKAI.

128
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,999
GO ON.

129
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,669
FROM THE PLANET
CHERON.

130
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,173
THAT'S IN
THE SOUTHERNMOST PART
OF THE GALAXY,

131
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,342
IN AN UNCHARTED
QUARTER.

132
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,635
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SO FAR FROM HOME?

133
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,599
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN
WE COMPLETE OUR MISSION

134
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,851
WE'LL TAKE YOU TO
STARBASE,

135
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,020
WHERE YOU'LL FACE
A VERY SERIOUS CHARGE.

136
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,479
THE CHARGE IS TRIFLING.

137
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,649
I WOULD HAVE RETURNED
THE SHIP AS SOON AS I...

138
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,027
GO ON. WHAT WERE
YOU GOING TO DO?

139
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,071
YOU MONOTONE HUMANS
ARE ALL ALIKE.

140
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:30,450
FIRST YOU CONDEMN,
AND THEN ATTACK!

141
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,203
I WILL ANSWER
NO MORE QUESTIONS.

142
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,538
WELL, HOWEVER WE
VIEW HIM, CAPTAIN,

143
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,999
HE'S CERTAINLY
NO ORDINARY SPECIMEN.

144
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,253
WELL, LOKAI,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
NORMAL FOR YOU ,EXACTLY,

145
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,380
BUT IF I HAD YOUR READINGS,

146
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:47,301
I WOULD BE THE MOST
INCREDIBLE PHYSICAL SPECIMEN
OF ALL TIME.

147
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,261
WE'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED
A BEING LIKE YOU.

148
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,222
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
MORE ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR PLANET.

149
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,015
I'M VERY TIRED.

150
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,850
AND VERY EVASIVE,

151
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,686
OR AT LEAST NOT...
FULLY RESPONSIVE.

152
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,396
NOW, THEN--

153
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,940
I INSIST
I'M EXTREMELY TIRED,

154
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,568
MADE SO BY YOUR VINDICTIVE
CROSS-EXAMINATIONS.

155
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,862
I WILL ANSWER NO MORE
QUESTIONS.

156
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,534
LIEUTENANT UHURA.

157
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,869
Intercom: LIEUTENANT
UHURA HERE.

158
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,039
NOTIFY STARBASE 4
THAT WE'VE RECOVERED
ITS SHUTTLECRAFT

159
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,835
AND IT WILL BE RETURNED
ALONG WITH ITS...USER

160
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,045
AS SOON AS WE'VE COMPLETED
OUR MISSION AT ARIANNUS.

161
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,255
AYE, SIR.

162
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,426
OH, BONES, IF YOU'RE SATISFIED
THAT THE MUTATION THEORY
IS APPLICABLE,

163
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,052
I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF IT
IN MY REPORT.

164
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,555
UNLESS WE GET MORE
INFORMATION FROM HIM,
IT'LL HAVE TO SERVE.

165
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,766

166
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,768
KIRK HERE.

167
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,937
Chekov: CAPTAIN, CONTACT
WITH ALIEN SHIP, SIR.

168
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,731
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
NOTIFY MR. SPOCK.

169
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,617
PUT THE SHIP ON
THE VIEWING SCREEN, MR. SULU.

170
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,414
MAGNIFICATION.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,502
STILL NOTHING,
MR. CHEKOV.

172
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,712
I VERIFY, SIR,
IT'S--IT'S OUT THERE.

173
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,173
[BEEPING]

174
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,429
MAXIMUM MAGNIFICATION.

175
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,102
I DRAW A BLANK, MR. SPOCK.
YOUR RESPONSE?

176
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,270
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.

177
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:26,566
NO MALFUNCTION, SIR.
THE READING PERSISTS.

178
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,573
WHAT IS IT?

179
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,242
THERE IS A VESSEL
OUT THERE, CAPTAIN.

180
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,202
COULD IT BE
A ROMULAN SHIP

181
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,828
USING THEIR
CLOAKING DEVICE?

182
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,497
NEGATIVE. THIS WOULD NOT
BE A ROMULAN VESSEL.

183
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,791
IT IS TOTALLY ALIEN
IN CONFIGURATION.

184
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,793
MOTIVE POWER UNKNOWN.

185
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,257
THE SMALL SIZE OF
THE CRAFT INDICATES
A RAPID SCOUT VESSEL,

186
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,175
ONE- OR TWO-MAN CREW.

187
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,524
CAPTAIN? I'VE TRIED
ALL HAILING FREQUENCIES.

188
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,317
NEGATIVE, SIR.

189
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,153
WEAPONRY ON
THE VESSEL, SPOCK?

190
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,696
NOTHING IDENTIFIABLE.

191
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,199
THE CRAFT APPEARS TO BE
BUILT FOR SPEED
RATHER THAN COMBAT.

192
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,618
SOMETHING OUT THERE
CAN'T BE SEEN.

193
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,078
EXPLANATION?

194
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,038
NONE. COMPLETELY ELUSIVE.

195
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,707
IN FACT, IT'S INVISIBLE.

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,044
INVISIBLE.

197
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,801
MALFUNCTION?

198
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,928
THERE IS NO SENSOR
FAILURE.

199
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,763
THE READINGS PERSIST.

200
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,312
IT'S HEADED
STRAIGHT FOR US.

201
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,775
EVASIVE ACTION.

202
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,486
[HUM OF ACCELERATION]

203
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,239
IT SHIFTS WITH US,
SIR.

204
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,991
AND WE'RE PUSHING
TO THE LIMIT.

205
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,953
DEFLECTOR SHIELDS ACTIVATED,
MR. SULU.

206
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,288
AUTOMATIC, SIR.

207
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,623
WE'RE ON
COLLISION COURSE!

208
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,292
IT'S OUT OF CONTROL
OR A SUICIDE MISSION.

209
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,877
SOUND ORDER FOR COLLISION.
RED ALERT.

210
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,588
[ALARM]

211
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,097
Sulu: BRACE YOURSELF
FOR COLLISION!

212
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,765
BRACE YOURSELF!

213
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,822
READOUT, MR. SPOCK?

214
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:43,411
IT JUST...DISINTEGRATED.
FASCINATING.

215
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,204
WHAT IS IT NOW?

216
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,788
IT IS GONE NOW,
CAPTAIN,

217
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:50,751
BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE
DEPOSITED AN ALIEN PRESENCE.

218
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,462
WHERE?

219
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,630
Man:
RIGHT HERE, CAPTAIN.

220
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,931
EXPLAIN, SPOCK.

221
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,687
ONE OF A KIND?

222
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,157
I AM BELE.

223
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,367
OF THE PLANET CHERON,
NO DOUBT.

224
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,453
FORGIVE MY UNORTHODOX
ARRIVAL.

225
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,164
YOUR MODE OF TRAVEL
WAS ALSO UNORTHODOX.

226
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,042
SECURE FROM RED ALERT.

227
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,378
WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOUR VEHICLE?

228
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,255
IT SERVED ME LONG
AND DURABLY.

229
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,549
UNFORTUNATELY,
THE STRAIN OF
ARDUOUS PURSUIT

230
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,593
HAS EXCEEDED EVEN ITS
ADVANCED QUALITIES.

231
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,094
I WAS JUST ABLE TO
COMPLETE THIS TRIP

232
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,680
AND DISEMBARK IN TIME,

233
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:47,267
OR I WOULD HAVE
DISINTEGRATED IN SPACE
WITH IT.

234
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,767
Spock: A MOST
UNIQUE CRAFT.

235
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,812
PITY IT COULDN'T BE
SALVAGED FOR OUR STUDY.

236
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,814
YES, IT WAS SHEATHED
IN SPECIAL MATERIALS

237
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,276
THAT RENDERED IT
INVISIBLE.

238
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,945
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO US?

239
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,282
YOU BEAR PRECIOUS CARGO.
LOKAI.

240
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,034
HE'S TAKEN REFUGE
ABOARD THIS SHIP.
I AM HERE TO CLAIM HIM.

241
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:16,546
ALL PERSONNEL ABOARD
THIS VESSEL ARE SUBJECT
TO MY COMMAND.

242
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,135
NO ONE CLAIMS ANYONE
WITHOUT DUE PROCESS.

243
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,094
MY APOLOGIES, CAPTAIN.

244
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,555
I OVERSTEP MY POWERS.

245
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,143
"CLAIM" IS UNDOUBTEDLY
AN UNFORTUNATE WORD.

246
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,604
WHAT IS YOUR AUTHORIZATION?
FROM WHAT SOURCE?

247
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,315
I AM CHIEF OFFICER
OF THE COMMISSION
ON POLITICAL TRAITORS.

248
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,734
LOKAI WAS TRIED AND
CONVICTED OF TREASON,

249
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,612
BUT HAD ESCAPED.

250
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,072
MAY I SEE HIM, PLEASE?

251
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,200
HE'S IN SICKBAY.

252
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,202
REMEMBER, SINCE YOU'RE
ABOARD THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

253
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,706
YOU'RE BOUND BY
ITS REGULATIONS.

254
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,958
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
CAPTAIN.

255
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,547
MR. SPOCK.

256
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,192
WELL, LOKAI,

257
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,943
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

258
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,863
THIS TIME I'M SURE
OUR JOINING

259
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,491
WILL BE OF A MORE
PERMANENT NATURE.

260
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,910
CAPTAIN, YOU'RE TO BE
CONGRATULATED.

261
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,831
NEVER BEFORE HAS LOKAI
BEEN RENDERED SO...

262
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,667
QUIESCENT.

263
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,877
I WILL NOT RETURN
TO CHERON WITH HIM!

264
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,587
TO A LAND
OF MURDERING
OPPRESSORS!

265
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,715
I TOLD YOU WHERE
YOU WERE GOING.

266
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,425
I ALLOWED YOUR
FELLOW COUNTRYMAN HERE

267
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,344
SIMPLY AS A COURTESY.

268
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,389
YOU SEE HOW THIS KILLER
REPAYS YOU--

269
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,433
AS HE REPAYS
ALL HIS BENEFACTORS.

270
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,144
BENEFACTORS?
HE'S A LIAR!

271
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,564
HE RAIDED OUR HOMES,

272
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,106
TORE US FROM
OUR FAMILIES,

273
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,316
HERDED US TOGETHER
LIKE CATTLE,

274
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,318
AND THEN SOLD US
AS SLAVES!

275
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,903
THEY WERE SAVAGES,
CAPTAIN.

276
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,239
WE TOOK THEM INTO
OUR HEARTS, OUR HOMES,
WE EDUCATED THEM.

277
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,699
YES--

278
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,077
JUST EDUCATION
ENOUGH TO SERVE
THE MASTER RACE.

279
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,288
YOU WERE THE PRODUCT
OF OUR LOVE!

280
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,040
AND YOU REPAID US
WITH MURDER.

281
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,001
WHY SHOULD A SLAVE SHOW
MERCY TO THE ENSLAVER?

282
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:23,297
SLAVES? THAT WAS CHANGED
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO.

283
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,382
YOU WERE FREED.

284
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,550
FREED?

285
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,554
WERE WE FREE TO BE MEN?

286
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,015
FREE TO BE HUSBANDS
AND FATHERS?

287
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,060
FREE TO LIVE OUR LIVES
IN EQUALITY AND DIGNITY?

288
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,730
YES, YOU WERE FREE,
IF YOU KNEW HOW TO USE
YOUR FREEDOM.

289
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,523
YOU WERE FREE ENOUGH
TO SLAUGHTER AND TO BURN

290
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,983
ALL THE THINGS THAT
HAD BEEN BUILT!

291
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,445
I TRIED TO BREAK
THE CHAINS OF
100 MILLION PEOPLE.

292
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,280
MY ONLY CRIME
IS THAT I FAILED.

293
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,948
TO THAT I DO
PLEAD GUILTY.

294
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,326
THERE IS AN ORDER
IN THINGS.

295
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:56,038
HE ASKS FOR UTOPIA
IN A DAY.

296
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,416
IT CAN'T BE DONE.

297
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,084
NOT IN A DAY.

298
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,546
AND NOT IN 10 TIMES
10,000 YEARS,
BY YOUR THINKING.

299
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,214
TO YOU WE ARE
A LOATHSOME BREED

300
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,674
WHO WILL NEVER
BE READY.

301
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,260
GENOCIDE FOR MY PEOPLE
IS THE PLAN
FOR<i> YOUR</i> UTOPIA!

302
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:13,180
YOU INSANE, FILTHY
LITTLE PLOTTER OF RUIN!

303
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:17,602
YOU VICIOUS SUBVERTER
OF EVERY DECENT THOUGHT.

304
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,940
YOU'RE COMING BACK
TO PAY FOR YOUR CRIMES!

305
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,400
I KNOW YOU,

306
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,611
AND ALL THOSE WITH WHOM
YOU'RE PLOTTING TO TAKE
POWER PERMANENTLY.

307
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,656
WHEN I RETURN TO CHERON,
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND
WHAT POWER IS.

308
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:33,284
I WILL HAVE ARMIES
OF FOLLOWERS!

309
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,536
IT IS NOW VERY CLEAR
THAT YOU KNOW EACH OTHER

310
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,497
EXTREMELY WELL,
GENTLEMEN.

311
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,502
THE ONLY SERVICE
THIS SHIP CAN OFFER IS
TO BRING YOU TOGETHER.

312
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,044
IT IS NOT
A BATTLEFIELD!

313
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,005
CAPTAIN,
I LED REVOLUTIONARIES,
NOT CRIMINALS.

314
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,214
I DEMAND POLITICAL ASYLUM.

315
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,634
THIS SHIP IS
A SANCTUARY.

316
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,761
I'LL TELL YOU
ONCE MORE--

317
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,514
FOR YOU, THIS SHIP
IS A PRISON.

318
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,724
CAPTAIN, IT IS IMPERATIVE

319
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,896
THAT YOU RETURN LOKAI
TO CHERON FOR JUDGMENT.

320
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,899
COMMISSIONER, CHERON
IS NOT A MEMBER
OF THE FEDERATION.

321
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,651
NO TREATIES HAVE
EVER BEEN SIGNED.

322
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,611
YOUR DEMAND FOR
POSSESSION OF
THIS PRISONER

323
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,404
CANNOT BE HONORED.

324
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,948
THERE ARE NO
EXTRADITION
PROCEDURES

325
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,449
TO ALLOW IT.

326
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,452
IS THAT CLEAR,
COMMISSIONER BELE?

327
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,497
CAPTAIN, I HOPE YOU WILL
BE SENSIBLE.

328
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,748
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

329
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,000
COOPERATION.

330
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,169
I CANNOT TAKE SIDES.

331
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,255
SINCE I AM WITHOUT A VESSEL
TO RETURN TO CHERON,

332
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,551
I INSIST THAT YOU
TAKE US THERE IMMEDIATELY.

333
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,552
IMPOSSIBLE. I HAVE
A MISSION TO ACCOMPLISH.

334
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,679
THERE'S A PLANET TO BE
DECONTAMINATED.

335
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,138
MILLIONS OF LIVES ARE
AT STAKE.

336
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,766
ONCE THAT HAS BEEN
COMPLETED, I'LL RETURN
TO STARBASE 4

337
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,352
AND TURN YOU BOTH OVER
TO THE AUTHORITIES.

338
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,855
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR CASE
TO THEM.

339
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,066
I AM SORRY, CAPTAIN.
THAT WILL NOT BE
SATISFACTORY.

340
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,819

00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,018
I AGREE!

514
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,229
COMPUTER...

515
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,941
THIS IS CAPTAIN JAMES KIRK
OF THE<i> U.S.S. ENTERPRISE.</i>

516
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,735
CODE 1-2-3, CONTINUITY.

517
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,365
ABORT DESTRUCT ORDER.

518
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:25,996
REPEAT,
CODE 1-2-3, CONTINUITY.

519
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,458
ABORT DESTRUCT ORDER.

520
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,461
Computer:
DESTRUCT ORDER ABORTED.

521
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,963
DESTRUCT ORDER ABORTED.

522
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,261
MR. SPOCK, IS THIS SHIP
HEADED FOR ARIANNUS?

523
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:45,265
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> IS NOW MOVING
IN A CIRCULAR COURSE.

524
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,394
AND AT WARP 10,
WE'RE GOING NOWHERE
MIGHTY FAST.

525
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,486
I WARNED YOU
OF HIS TREACHERY.

526
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,656
KILL HIM!

527
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,035
WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU TO
FULFILL YOUR COMMITMENT,
COMMISSIONER.

528
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,204
CAPTAIN, I AM HAPPY
TO HAVE YOU COMPLETE
YOUR MISSION OF MERCY

529
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,665
TO THE PLANET ARIANNUS.

530
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:13,043
IT WAS MADNESS TO
INTERFERE WITH SUCH
A WORTHWHILE ENDEAVOR.

531
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:17,590
BUT IF YOU WILL,
UPON COMPLETION, PLEASE

532
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:21,427
TAKE ME AND MY TRAITOROUS
CAPTIVE TO CHERON.

533
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,596
I MAKE NO DEALS FOR
CONTROL OF THIS SHIP, SIR.

534
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,662
THE SHIP'S COURSE IS NOW
IN YOUR CONTROL.

535
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,881
SHIP'S COURSE?

536
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,968
<i>ENTERPRISE</i> IS NOW ON COURSE
TO ARIANNUS, CAPTAIN.

537
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,223
SPEED, SCOTTY?

538
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,727
WARP 6 AND SMOOTHLY
OPERATING, SIR.

539
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,313
GOOD.

540
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,564
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
CANCEL RED ALERT.

541
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:16,565
AYE, SIR.

542
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,651
LET ME REAFFIRM
MY POSITION, GENTLEMEN.

543
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,026
I COULD PUT YOU
IN THE BRIG FOR WHAT
YOU'VE DONE,

544
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:25,407
BUT I WON'T DO IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE NEW TO
THIS PART OF THE GALAXY,

545
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,494
WHICH IS GOVERNED BY
THE UNITED FEDERATION
OF PLANETS.

546
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:33,039
WE LIVE IN PEACE
WITH FULL EXERCISE
OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS.

547
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:36,876
THE NEED TO RESORT
TO VIOLENCE AND FORCE
HAS LONG SINCE PASSED,

548
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,339
AND THEY WILL NOT
BE TOLERATED ABOARD
THIS SHIP.

549
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,550
YOU ARE FREE TO
MOVE ABOUT THE SHIP.

550
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,511
I HOPE THAT YOU'LL
TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY

551
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,305
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT
THE FEDERATION

552
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,726
THROUGH ITS BEST
REPRESENTATIVES--
MY CREW.

553
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,520
BUT LET ME MAKE IT
CLEAR,

554
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,980
I WILL STAND FOR NO
INTERFERENCE

555
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,566
WITH THE FUNCTION
OF THIS SHIP.

556
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:03,612
ALL HANDS, RETURN
TO NORMAL ROUTINE.
CAPTAIN OUT.

557
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,582
YOU SPEAK VERY WELL,
CAPTAIN.

558
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,793
YOUR WORDS PROMISE
JUSTICE FOR ALL.

559
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,627
WE TRY, SIR.

560
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,004
YES, WELL, I HAVE LEARNED
TO WAIT FOR ACTIONS.

561
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,382
AFTER ARIANNUS,
WHAT IS JUSTICE?

562
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,592
I SHALL WAIT TO SEE IT
DISPENSED.

563
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,265
FASCINATING--

564
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,185
TWO IRREVOCABLY
HOSTILE HUMANOIDS.

565
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,437
DISGUSTING IS WHAT
I CALL THEM.

566
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,816
THAT DESCRIPTION IS NOT
SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE.

567
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,777
MR. SPOCK,
THE WORD "DISGUSTING"

568
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,446
DESCRIBES EXACTLY
WHAT I FEEL ABOUT
THOSE TWO.

569
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,532
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

570
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,368
THOSE TWO ARE BEGINNING
TO AFFECT YOU.

571
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,628
AND I KNOW FROM MY ACTIONS
YOU MUST ALL THINK ME
A VOLCANIC HOTHEAD,

572
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:07,676
ERUPTING LAVA FROM MY NOSTRILS
AT DANGER SIGNALS THAT ARE ONLY
FIGMENTS OF MY IMAGINATION.

573
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,678
BUT BELIEVE ME, MY FRIENDS,

574
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,723
THERE CAN BE NO MOMENT
WHEN I CAN HAVE MY GUARD DOWN

575
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,892
WHERE SUCH AS BELE IS PRESENT.

576
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,770
SO WHAT HAPPENS?
I ACT THE MADMAN

577
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:20,564
OUT OF THE ANGER AND FRUSTRATION
HE FORCES UPON ME,

578
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,859
AND THEREBY PROVE HIS POINT
THAT I<i> AM</i> A MADMAN.

579
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,904
Sulu:
NO ONE KNOWS HOW HE'LL REACT
UNDER PRESSURE, LOKAI.

580
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,406
Chekov: AFTER ALL,
WE ARE ONLY HUMAN.

581
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,074
Lokai: AH, MR. CHEKOV--

582
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:35,412
THEREIN LIES MY LACK OF ABILITY
TO ALERT YOU AND YOUR CAPTAIN

583
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:38,540
TO THE REAL THREAT
OF SOMEONE LIKE BELE.

584
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,584
SEE, YOU ARE FROM
THE PLANET ON EARTH.

585
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,295
THERE IS NO PERSECUTION
ON YOUR PLANET.

586
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,589
HOW CAN YOU UNDERSTAND
MY FEAR,

587
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,759
MY APPREHENSION,
MY DEGRADATION,
MY SUFFERING?

588
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,719
Chekov: THERE WAS PERSECUTION
ON EARTH ONCE.

589
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,806
I REMEMBER READING ABOUT IT
IN MY HISTORY CLASS.

590
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,015
Sulu: YES, BUT IT HAPPENED
WAY BACK IN THE 20th CENTURY.

591
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,811
THERE'S NO SUCH PRIMITIVE
THINKING TODAY.

592
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:02,815
Lokai: YOU HAVE READ ABOUT IT
IN HISTORY BOOKS.

593
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,983
HOW CAN I MAKE YOUR FLESH
KNOW HOW IT FEELS

594
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,653
TO SEE ALL THOSE
WHO ARE LIKE ME,

595
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,696
AND ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE,

596
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,532
DESPISED, SLAUGHTERED,
AND EVEN WORSE,

597
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,367
DENIED THE SIMPLEST BIT
OF DECENCY

598
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,496
THAT IS A LIVING BEING'S RIGHT.

599
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,997
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT WOULD BE LIKE

600
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,417
TO BE DRAGGED OUT OF YOUR HOVEL
INTO A WAR ON ANOTHER PLANET?

601
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,962
A BATTLE THAT WILL SERVE
YOUR OPPRESSOR

602
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,547
AND BRING DEATH TO YOU
AND YOUR BROTHERS.

603
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,476
PUTTING THE MATTER
INTO THE HANDS

604
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,477
OF YOUR
STARFLEET COMMAND

605
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,729
IS OF COURSE THE
PROPER PROCEDURE.

606
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,940
HOW LONG WILL IT BE
BEFORE WE HEAR FROM
THEM, CAPTAIN?

607
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,400
I EXPECT THE ANSWER IS
ALREADY ON ITS WAY.

608
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,443
WELL, THEN, LET US
DRINK TO

609
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,778
THEIR WISE SOLUTION
TO OUR PROBLEM.

610
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,488
LET'S DO.

611
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,365
COMMISSIONER,
STARFLEET COMMAND
MAY NOT ARRIVE

612
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,368
AT THE SOLUTION YOU
ANTICIPATE.

613
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:00,079
THERE IS THE MATTER OF
THE SHUTTLECRAFT WHICH
LOKAI APPROPRIATED.

614
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,374
THE INTERROGATION
OF THAT MATTER MAY BE

615
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,168
OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
TO STARFLEET.

616
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,672
GENTLEMEN, WE ARE
DISCUSSING A QUESTION
OF DEGREE.

617
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,049
SURELY STEALING
A SHUTTLECRAFT

618
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,592
CANNOT BE EQUATED
WITH THE IMPORTANCE

619
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,553
OF MURDERING THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE.

620
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:18,056
WE DO NOT KNOW
THAT LOKAI HAS DONE THAT.

621
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,018
ONE THING WE ARE
AGREED ON IS THAT
LOKAI IS A CRIMINAL.

622
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,186
NO, COMMISSIONER,

623
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,270
THE ONE THING WE'VE
AGREED UPON IS THAT
LOKAI TOOK A SHUTTLECRAFT.

624
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:24,688
[SHIP'S WHISTLE]

625
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:25,647
EXCUSE ME.

626
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,983
Intercom: LIEUTENANT
UHURA TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

627
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,359
KIRK HERE.

628
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,861
I HAVE A COMMUNICATION FROM
STARFLEET COMMAND, SIR.

629
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,988
YES, READ IT.

630
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,615
"STARFLEET COMMAND EXTENDS

NOW, WAIT A MINUTE,
COMMISSIONER--

00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,532
EVEN IF THEY DON'T
RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES
AS BEING SUCH.

646
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,494
YES, HE WILL EVADE,
DELAY, AND ESCAPE AGAIN,

647
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,997
AND IN THE PROCESS
PUT THOUSANDS

648
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,959
OF INNOCENT BEINGS AT
EACH OTHER'S THROATS,

GETTING THEM TO KILL

WHICH THEY HAVE NO
STAKE IN,

651
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,090
BUT WHICH HE WILL
FORCE THEM TO
VIOLENTLY ESPOUSE

652
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:37,886
BY TWISTING THEIR MINDS
WITH HIS LIES, HIS
LOATHSOME ACCUSATIONS,

653
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:41,556
AND HIS FOUL THREATS.

654
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,432
I CAN ASSURE YOU,
COMMISSIONER,

655
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,143
THAT OUR MINDS
WILL NOT BE TWISTED,

656
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,354
NOT BY LOKAI,
NOR BY YOU.

657
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,273
IT IS OBVIOUS TO
THE MOST SIMPLEMINDED

658
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,068
THAT LOKAI IS OF
AN INFERIOR BREED.

659
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,862
Spock: THE OBVIOUS
VISUAL EVIDENCE,
COMMISSIONER,

660
00:35:55,988 --> 00:36:00,199
IS THAT HE IS OF THE SAME
BREED AS YOURSELF.

661
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,410
ARE YOU BLIND,
COMMANDER SPOCK?

662
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,536
WELL, LOOK AT ME.

663
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,916
LOOK AT ME.

664
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,251
YOU'RE BLACK ON ONE SIDE
AND WHITE ON THE OTHER.

665
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,671
I AM BLACK
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

666
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,679
I FAIL TO SEE
THE SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE.

667
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,221
LOKAI IS<i> WHITE</i>
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

668
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,516
ALL OF HIS PEOPLE
ARE WHITE ON
THE RIGHT SIDE.

669
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,562
HMM.

670
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,565
COMMISSIONER,
PERHAPS THE EXPERIENCE
OF MY OWN PLANET VULCAN

671
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,527
MAY SET AN EXAMPLE
OF SOME VALUE TO YOU.

672
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,864
VULCAN WAS IN DANGER
OF BEING DESTROYED

673
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,866
BY THE SAME CONDITIONS
AND CHARACTERISTICS

674
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,451
WHICH THREATEN
TO DESTROY CHERON.

675
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,704
WE WERE ONCE A PEOPLE
LIKE YOURSELVES--

676
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:46,872
WILDLY EMOTIONAL,

677
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:50,583
OFTEN COMMITTED TO
IRRATIONALLY OPPOSING
POINTS OF VIEW,

678
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,420
LEADING, OF COURSE,
TO DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.

679
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:58,967
ONLY THE DISCIPLINE
OF LOGIC SAVED MY PLANET
FROM EXTINCTION.

680
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,511
COMMANDER SPOCK,
I AM DELIGHTED THAT
VULCAN WAS SAVED,

681
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,139
BUT YOU CANNOT EXPECT
LOKAI AND PEOPLE
LIKE HIM

682
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,141
TO ACT WITH
SELF-DISCIPLINE

683
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,851
ANY MORE THAN
YOU CAN EXPECT A PLANET

684
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,395
TO STOP ORBITING
ITS SUN.

685
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,190
LET LOKAI STATE
HIS GRIEVANCES.

686
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,150
HEAR HIM.
LISTEN TO HIM.

687
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,276
MAYBE HE CAN CHANGE.
MAYBE HE WANTS--

688
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,987
THEY CANNOT CHANGE.

689
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:22,866
CHANGE IS THE ESSENTIAL
PROCESS OF ALL EXISTENCE.

690
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,409
FOR INSTANCE,
THE PEOPLE OF CHERON

691
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,829
MUST HAVE ONCE
BEEN MONO-COLORED.

692
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,415
YOU MEAN LIKE
BOTH OF YOU?

693
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,167
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A TIME--
LONG AGO, NO DOUBT--

694
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,501
WHEN THAT WAS TRUE.

695
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,878
[SHIP'S WHISTLE]

696
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,838
EXCUSE ME.

697
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,549
KIRK HERE.

698
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,134

ARIANNUS, SIR.

AT ONCE, SIR.
SCOTT OUT.

703
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,145
I ONCE HEARD THAT
ON SOME OF YOUR PLANETS,

704
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:57,316
PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY ARE
DESCENDED FROM APES.

705
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,695
THE ACTUAL THEORY IS
THAT ALL LIFEFORMS

706
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,075
EVOLVED FROM THE LOWER LEVELS
TO THE MORE ADVANCED STAGES.

707
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,412
READY FOR DECONTAMINATION
PROCEDURE.

708
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,413
READY, SIR.

709
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,081

LIEUTENANT UHURA,
ADVISE ARIANNUS

716
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,556
THE MISSION IS
TO BEGIN ON SIGNAL.

717
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,934
ALL GROUND PRECAUTIONS
MUST BE READY.

718
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,562
ARIANNUS SAYS,
"GO AHEAD."

719
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,566
WELL, LET HER RIP.

720
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,639
SCOTT TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,227
GOOD. REPEAT PROCEDURE

724
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,146
AYE, SIR.

725
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,815
READY TO REPEAT
DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURE.

726
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,441
READY, SIR.

727
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,484
MR. SULU.

728
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,944

KIRK HERE.

730
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,420
WE'RE COMPLETING
THE FINAL ORBIT
OF ARIANNUS, SIR.

731
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:44,090
I'M AWAITING INSTRUCTIONS
TO SET COURSE FOR
THE NEXT DESTINATION.

732
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:45,884
VERY GOOD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT UP.

733
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,511
SET DIRECTIONAL CONTROLS
FOR STARBASE 4.

734
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,347
KIRK OUT.

735
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,768
WILL YOU JOIN US
ON THE BRIDGE?

736
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,770
THERE IS NOTHING
I WOULD LIKE MORE.

737
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,527
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 5730.7.

738
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,779
HAVING COMPLETED
OUR MISSION TO ARIANNUS,

739
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,782
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> IS NOW
ON COURSE TO STARBASE 4.

740
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:14,120
THE CREW IS ON NORMAL ROUTINE,
AND WE ARE PROCEEDING
WITHOUT INCIDENT.

741
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,497
TROUBLE, MR. CHEKOV?

742
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,750
I DON'T RIGHTLY KNOW,
MR. SPOCK.

743
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,127
I WAS TRYING TO PROGRAM
FOR STARBASE 4 AS ORDERED.

744
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,296
I CAN'T GET A RESPONSE.

745
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,840
IT JUST SEEMED
TO GO DEAD, SIR.

746
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,636
CAPTAIN, SOME OF
THE MEMORY BANKS
OF THE COMPUTER

747
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,138
ARE BURNED OUT.

748
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,723
CAN YOU DETERMINE
WHICH ONES?

749
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,101
THE DIRECTIONAL CONTROL
AND THE SELF-DESTRUCT, CAPTAIN,

750
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,270
ARE BOTH BURNT OUT.

751
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,146
I DID IT LIKE THIS.

752
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,901
[CRACKLING]

753
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:12,429
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 5730.6.

754
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,930
IN A DELIBERATE ACT OF SABOTAGE,

755
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,848
COMMISSIONER BELE HAS BURNED OUT
OUR DESTRUCT MECHANISM

756
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:20,103
AND THROUGH THE POWER
OF HIS WILL HAS AGAIN TAKEN OVER

757
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,687
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

758
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:26,692
NOW CAN WE GO TO CHERON
WITHOUT ANY MORE DISCUSSION?

759
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,448
AT THE MOMENT, I SEEM
TO HAVE NO CHOICE.

760
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,826
SO THIS IS JUSTICE
AFTER ARIANNUS!

761
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,328
YOU HAVE SIGNED
MY DEATH WARRANT.

762
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:38,830
I WARNED YOU
WHAT TO EXPECT.

763
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:42,750
BUT YOU CONTINUE TO LET
THIS MOCKERY OF JUSTICE
GO ON?

764
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,543
IF YOU ARE PARTISANS
OF JUSTICE, PROVE IT.

765
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,920
KILL HIM!

766
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,381
Chekov: WE ARE
NOT KILLERS.

767
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,050
THEN WHAT DO YOU DO?
CARRY JUSTICE ON YOUR TONGUES?

768
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:51,550
YOU WILL BEG FOR IT,

769
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,470
BUT YOU WON'T FIGHT
OR DIE FOR IT!

770
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,221
AFTER SO MANY YEARS
OF LEADING THE FIGHT,

771
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,931
YOU SEEM VERY MUCH ALIVE.

772
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,101
I DOUBT THAT THE SAME
CAN BE SAID FOR MANY
OF HIS FOLLOWERS.

773
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,853
YOU'RE FINISHED, LOKAI!

774
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:05,190
OH, WE'VE GOT YOUR KIND
PENNED IN ON CHERON
INTO LITTLE DISTRICTS,

775
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:08,026
AND IT'S NOT GOING
TO CHANGE.

776
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,154
YOU'VE COMBED THE GALAXY
AND COME UP WITH NOTHING
BUT MONO-COLORED TRASH,

777
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,655
DO-GOODERS,
AND BLEEDING HEARTS.

778
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,158
YOU'RE DEAD,
YOU HALF-WHITE!

779
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:19,412
YOU USELESS PIECES
OF BLAND FLESH.

780
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,790
I'LL TAKE YOU WITH ME,
YOU HALF-BLACK!

782
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,295
BELE!

783
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,547
YOU KEEP THIS UP, AND YOU'LL
NEVER GET TO CHERON
WITH YOUR PRISONER.

784
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,509
THE BRIDGE OF THIS SHIP WILL BE
IRREPARABLY DAMAGED!

785
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,552
THIS WILL BE
YOUR FINAL BATTLEFIELD!

786
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:39,516
YOUR 50,000 YEARS OF PURSUIT
WILL HAVE BEEN WASTED!

787
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,187
AND YOU, LOKAI--

788
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:48,358
YOU'LL DIE HERE IN SPACE.

789
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,193
YOU'LL INSPIRE
NO MORE DISCIPLES.

790
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,570
YOUR CAUSE WILL BE ENDED!

791
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,531
REMEMBER, CAPTAIN--

792
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,200
POLITICAL SANCTUARY
IS MY RIGHT!

793
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:01,538
I AM YOUR PRISONER.
HONOR THAT RIGHT,

794
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,372
OR THE FIGHT WILL
GO ON

795
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,332
AND YOUR SHIP
WILL BURN UP!

796
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,125
YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT.

797
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,919
IF YOU LISTEN TO
HIS LEGALISTIC TRICKERY,

798
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,505
I SHALL HAVE TO
DESTROY THIS SHIP
AND EVERYBODY ABOARD!

799
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,798
I UNDERSTAND.

800
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:16,594
WILL YOU RETURN THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
TO MY CONTROL?

801
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,897
WHY NOT?

802
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:42,537
SCOTTY, HAVE REPAIRS
ON DIRECTIONAL CONTROL
BEEN COMPLETED?

803
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,663
AYE, SIR.
REROUTED.

804
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,208

Sulu: CONTROLS

806
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,795
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

807
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,255
CAPTAIN,
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

808
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,757
Chekov: LOCKING
ONTO COORDINATES.

809
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,552
CAPTAIN, WE ARE WITHIN
SCANNING RANGE OF CHERON.

810
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,474
IS IT WITHIN
VISUAL RANGE?

811
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,601
COMING WITHIN VISUAL RANGE
NOW, CAPTAIN.

812
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,603
CHEKOV, PUT IT ON THE SCREEN,
EXTREME MAGNIFICATION.

813
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,693
WHAT ARE YOU PICKING UP?

814
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,615
SEVERAL VERY LARGE CITIES,
UNINHABITED.

815
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:23,744
EXTENSIVE TRAFFIC SYSTEMS,
BARREN OF TRAFFIC.

816
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:28,749
LOWER ANIMALS AND VEGETATION
ENCROACHING ON THE CITIES.

817
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:32,545
NO SAPIENT LIFEFORMS
REGISTERING AT ALL,
CAPTAIN.

818
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,673
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF
NATURAL DISASTER,

819
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,926
YET THERE ARE VAST NUMBERS
OF UNBURIED CORPSES
IN ALL CITIES.

820
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,513
YOU MEAN...

821
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:44,932
ALL THE PEOPLE ARE DEAD?

822
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,685
ALL DEAD, CAPTAIN.

823
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,606
THEY HAVE ANNIHILATED
EACH OTHER--TOTALLY.

824
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:56,569
MY PEOPLE...ALL DEAD?

825
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,738
YES, COMMISSIONER.
ALL OF THEM.

826
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,824
NO ONE ALIVE?

827
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,868
NONE AT ALL, SIR.

828
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:09,165
YOUR BAND OF MURDERERS
DID THIS!

829
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,001
YOU GENOCIDAL
MANIAC!

830
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,378
Kirk: STOP IT!

831
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,546
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU TWO?

832
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:18,174
DIDN'T YOU HEAR SPOCK?
YOUR PLANET IS DEAD!

833
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,678
THERE'S NOBODY ALIVE
ON CHERON BECAUSE OF HATE.

834
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,721
THE CAUSE YOU FOUGHT ABOUT
NO LONGER EXISTS.

835
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,808
GIVE YOURSELVES TIME TO BREATHE,
GIVE UP YOUR HATE!

836
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:32,271
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO LIVE WITH US.

837
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,357
LISTEN TO ME.

838
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:37,776
YOU BOTH MUST END UP DEAD

839
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,530
IF YOU DON'T STOP HATING.

840
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:43,533
YOU'RE AN IDEALISTIC
DREAMER.

841
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,621
BELE...

842
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,543
THE CHASE IS FINISHED.

843
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:56,128
HE MUST NOT ESCAPE ME.

844
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,464
WHERE CAN HE GO?

845
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,306
BELE...

846
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,225
SHALL I ALERT
SECURITY, SIR?

847
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,768
NO, LIEUTENANT.

848
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,606
WHERE CAN THEY RUN?

849
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:36,669
Spock: CAPTAIN,
I HAVE LOCATED THEM
ON SHIP SENSORS.

850
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:39,838
BELE IS CHASING LOKAI...

851
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:43,426
ON DECK 3.

852
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:03,738
BELE IS PASSING
RECREATION ROOM 3,

853
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,822
APPROACHING
THE CREWMEN'S LOUNGE.

854
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,452
LOKAI IS RUNNING
PAST THE CREWMAN'S LOUNGE.

855
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,719
LOKAI HAS JUST ARRIVED
ON DECK 5.

856
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,159
PASSING RECREATION ROOM 3.

857
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,756
CAPTAIN, SOMEONE
HAS ACTIVATED THE
TRANSPORTER MECHANISM.

858
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,466
SPOCK, ANYONE IN
THE TRANSPORTER ROOM?

859
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,926
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.
TRANSPORTER ROOM IS CLEAR.

860
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:15,393
HOWEVER, THERE IS A LIFEFORM
MATERIALIZING ON THE PLANET.

861
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:19,480
IT IS LOKAI.
HE IS BACK ON CHERON.

862
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,273
THERE'S NOBODY THERE
TO TRY HIM.

863
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,860
HIS JUDGES ARE
ALL DEAD.

864
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:41,502
CAPTAIN, THE TRANSPORTER
MECHANISM HAS BEEN
ACTIVATED AGAIN.

865
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,128
OF COURSE.

866
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,547
IT IS BELE, CAPTAIN.

867
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:57,560
AND ANOTHER LIFEFORM
HAS APPEARED ON CHERON.

868
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,778
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

869
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:13,992
TO EXPECT SENSE FROM
TWO MENTALITIES OF SUCH
EXTREME VIEWPOINTS

870
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,370
IS NOT LOGICAL.

871
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,580
BUT THEIR PLANET'S
DEAD.

872
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,123
DOES IT MATTER NOW
WHICH ONE'S RIGHT?

873
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,208
NOT TO LOKAI AND BELE.

874
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,879
ALL THAT MATTERS TO THEM
IS THEIR HATE.

875
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,465
DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT'S
ALL THEY EVER HAD, SIR?

876
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,341
NO.

877
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:33,262
BUT THAT'S ALL
THEY HAVE LEFT.

878
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,806
WARP FACTOR 2,
MR. SULU.

879
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:39,143
SET COURSE FOR
STARBASE...4.
