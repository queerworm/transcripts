Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 5843.7.

00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,343
THE "ENTERPRISE" IS
IN THE GRIP

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,719
OF A RAGING EPIDEMIC.

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,888
3 CREWMEN HAVE DIED,

5
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:16,016
AND 23 OTHERS HAVE BEEN
STRUCK DOWN BY RIGELLIAN FEVER.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,018
IN ORDER TO COMBAT
THE ILLNESS,

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,688
DR. McCOY NEEDS
LARGE QUANTITIES OF RYETALYN,

8
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,064
WHICH IS THE ONLY KNOWN
ANTIDOTE FOR THE FEVER.

9
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,192
OUR SENSORS
HAVE PICKED UP

10
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,194
SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES
OF PURE RYETALYN

11
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,989
ON A SMALL PLANET
IN THE OMEGA SYSTEM.

12
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,740
WE ARE BEAMING DOWN

13

URGENTLY NEEDED MATERIAL.

A LARGE DEPOSIT,

16
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,164

4 KILOMETERS AWAY.

17
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,959

TO PROCESS
THAT STUFF.

18
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,669

20
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,088

I HAVE MONITORED
YOUR SHIP

32
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,988
SINCE IT ENTERED
THIS SYSTEM.

33
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,490
THEN IF YOU KNOW
WHO WE ARE,

34
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,492
YOU KNOW WHY
WE'RE HERE, MISTER...

35
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,036

36
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,038

37
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,541
DID YOU SAY YOUR

38

MY RETREAT FROM
THE UNPLEASANTNESS
OF LIFE ON EARTH

39
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,630

I HAVE A SICK CREW
UP THERE.

42
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,511
WE CAN'T POSSIBLY REACH
ANOTHER PLANET IN TIME.

43
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,013
YOU CAN'T REFUSE US

44
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,265
YOU'RE TRESPASSING,

45
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,978

46
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,395
WE'LL PAY FOR IT,

47
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,522

TRADE FOR IT.

48
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,357
YOU HAVE NOTHING
I WANT.

49
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,111
BUT YOU HAVE
THE RYETALYN
THAT WE NEED.

50
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,446
IF NECESSARY,
WE'LL TAKE IT.

51
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,116
IF YOU DO NOT LEAVE
VOLUNTARILY,

52
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:40,035
I HAVE THE POWER
TO FORCE YOU TO LEAVE...

53
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,329
OR KILL YOU
WHERE YOU STAND.

54
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,261
Kirk: SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

55
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:08,063
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES OF
THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

56
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:12,067
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--
TO EXPLORE STRANGE NEW WORLDS,

57
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,071
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,

58
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,658
TO BOLDLY GO
WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

59

HAPPENS TO US,

4 DEATHS...

65
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,012
AND THEN MY CREW
COMES DOWN

66
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,223
AND TAKES
THAT RYETALYN.

67
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,560
AN INTERESTING
TEST OF POWER--

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,687
YOUR ENORMOUS FORCES
AGAINST MINE.

69
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,355

MR. FLINT,

UNLESS
YOU ARE CERTAIN,

72
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,612
I WOULD SUGGEST
YOU REFRAIN

73
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,989
FROM A MOST
USELESS
EXPERIMENT.

74
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,575
WE NEED
ONLY A FEW HOURS.

75
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,869
HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN A VICTIM
OF RIGELLIAN FEVER?

THEY DIE IN ONE DAY.

77
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,998
THE EFFECTS ARE
LIKE BUBONIC PLAGUE.

THE STREETS, THE SEWERS.

IT LEFT LEFT THE CITY
BY OX CART, BY SEA

82
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,306

HALF OF EUROPE.

TIME YOU WILL LEAVE.

00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,746

00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,541
THE PRECIOUS TIME
I HAVE LET PASS

348
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,003
MAY RESULT IN DISASTER
FOR THE "ENTERPRISE"
AND HER CREW.

349
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,869
YOU LEFT US.

350
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,455
THE ROOM
BECAME LONELY.

351
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,749
IT IS A THIRST,

352
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,876
A FLOWER DYING
IN THE DESERT.

353
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,878
WHAT?

354
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,182
WHAT'S IN THERE?

355
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,059
I DO NOT KNOW.

356
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,686
FLINT TOLD ME
NEVER TO ENTER.

357
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,772
HE DENIES ME
NOTHING ELSE.

358
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,565
THEN WHY
ARE YOU HERE?

359
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,070
I DO NOT KNOW.

360
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,906
I COME HERE
WHEN I AM TROUBLED...

361
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,118
WHEN I WOULD...

362
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,078
SEARCH MYSELF.

ARE YOU

00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,499
YES.

365
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,293

00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,643
ARE YOU...

367
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:37,315
HAPPY HERE
WITH FLINT?

368
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,150
HE'S THE GREATEST,
KINDEST, WISEST MAN
IN THE GALAXY.

369
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,529

ARE YOU AFRAID?

371
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,889

374
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,904
STOP!

375
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,419
THANK YOU, MR. SPOCK.

376
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,256
FORTUNATELY,
THE ROBOT DID NOT
DETECT MY PRESENCE

377
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,465
AND DEACTIVATE
MY PHASER.

378
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:47,445

ALTERED ITS INSTRUCTIONS

00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,491
TO ALLOW FOR UNAUTHORIZED
BUT PREDICTABLE ACTIONS

382
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,077
ON YOUR PART.

383
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,330
IT THOUGHT YOU WERE
ATTACKING RAYNA--

384
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,831
A MISINTERPRETATION.

385
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,458
IF IT WERE AROUND
RIGHT NOW,

386
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,917
IT WOULD CORRECT--

388
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,885
TOO USEFUL A DEVICE
TO BE WITHOUT, REALLY.

389
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,512
I CREATED ANOTHER.

390
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:18,100
IT WILL NOW GO TO THE LABORATORY
AND JOIN DR. McCOY.

391
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,272
FASCINATING.

392
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:26,317
BE THANKFUL
THAT YOU DID NOT
ATTACK ME, CAPTAIN.

393
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,943
I MIGHT HAVE
ACCEPTED BATTLE,

394
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,321
AND I HAVE TWICE
YOUR PHYSICAL STRENGTH.

395
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,323
IN YOUR OWN WORDS,
IT WOULD BE

396
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,908
AN INTERESTING TEST
OF POWER.

397
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,535
HOW CHILDISH
HE IS, RAYNA.

398
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:40,747
WOULD YOU CALL HIM
BRAVE OR A FOOL?

399
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,918
I'M...

400
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,962
GLAD HE DID
NOT DIE.

401
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,546

MAY I SUGGEST
THAT YOU WAIT HERE
PATIENTLY--SAFELY?

408
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,313
YOU HAVE SEEN

409
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,606
THAT MY DEFENSE
SYSTEMS OPERATE
AUTOMATICALLY,

410
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:10,361

IN ACCORDANCE
WITH MY WISHES.

00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,434

RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST

00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,977
THAT YOU PAY
LESS ATTENTION

00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,406

423
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,116

427
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,624
YES.

428
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,626
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
THE ATTACK,

429
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,671
BUT HE SEEMED
TO WANT US TOGETHER.

00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,678
IT DOES
APPEAR TO DEFY
THE MALE LOGIC

00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,222

00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,870
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT,

460
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,163

00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:51,771

TO WISH US
TO LINGER,

472
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,106
YET HE IS...

473
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,525
APPREHENSIVE.

474
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,068
IT IS LOGICAL
TO ASSUME

475
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,028
THAT WE ARE BEING
MONITORED

476
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:01,323
AND THAT HE IS AWARE
OF OUR EVERY MOVE.

477
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,498
YOU SENT THE ROBOT
TO KILL HIM.

478
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,500
IT CAME
TO PROTECT YOU.

479
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,544
MY MIND COULD NOT
HAVE SUMMONED IT.

480
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:14,878
I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED.

481
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,505
IT WAS
DEFECTIVE THEN.

482
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,632
I WOULD HAVE
DESTROYED IT MYSELF.

483
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,135

484
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,054

00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,848

00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,863
GO TO THEM

00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,657

HE HAVE OVER HER?

503
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,482

I WOULD SUGGEST

504
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,318
THAT OUR IMMEDIATE CONCERN
IS THE RYETALYN.

505
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,824
LET'S FIND McCOY.

00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,335
I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE LAB.

508
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,841
I'VE COME TO SAY
GOOD-BYE.

509
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,385
I DON'T WANT
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

510
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,914
A LAST TENDER ENCOUNTER,
CAPTAIN KIRK,

511
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,333
TO END YOUR USEFULNESS.

512
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,919
I TELL YOU, SPOCK--
I WAS WAITING

513
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,797
FOR THE ROBOT TO FINISH
THE PROCESSING.

514
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,842
AND THE NEXT THING
I KNEW, IT WAS GONE,
AND SO WAS THE RYETALYN.

515
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,343
INTERESTING.
OBVIOUSLY
MR. FLINT

516
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,387
IS NOT YET
READY FOR US
TO DEPART.

517
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,639
WELL, I THINK
WE'D BETTER TELL JIM.

518
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,016
THE CAPTAIN
WANTED US
TO WAIT HERE.

519
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,060
COME WITH ME.

520
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,104
I...

521
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,773
I OFFER YOU
HAPPINESS.

522
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:24,150

SECURITY HERE.

00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,278
CHILDHOOD MUST END.

524
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,114
YOU LOVE ME,
NOT FLINT.

525
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,424
FLINT LIED.
THE RYETALYN
ISN'T HERE.

526
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,551
PICKING UP
TRICORDER READINGS, CAPTAIN.

527
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,262
APPARENTLY THE RYETALYN
IS BEHIND THIS DOOR.

528
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:06,526
WHY IS FLINT PLAYING
TRICKS ON US?

529
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,991
APPARENTLY WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO GO IN
AND GET IT...

530
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,827
IF WE CAN.

531
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:18,371
WELL, LET'S
NOT DISAPPOINT
THE CHESS MASTER.

532
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,540
PHASERS ON FULL.

533
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,338
CAPTAIN.

534
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,757
I SHALL GET
THE RYETALYN.

535
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,343
WHY YOU?

536
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,553
THERE MAY BE
DANGERS WITHIN.

537
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,348
LET'S FIND OUT.

538
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,016
LET ME GO ALONE,
CAPTAIN.

539
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,977
McCoy: WHY?

540
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,188
GET TO THE POINT, SPOCK,
IF THERE IS ONE.

541
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,984
WE'LL ALL GO.

542
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,590
THE RYETALYN.

543
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,944
Kirk, voice-over: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 5843.8.

544
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,153
WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
OUR MISSION

545
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,697
AND HAVE THE RYETALYN
READY TO COMBAT

546
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,075
THE EPIDEMIC
ABOARD THE "ENTERPRISE,"

547
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:21,411
BUT WE HAVE ALSO DISCOVERED
OUR BENEFACTOR'S SECRET.

548
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,998
HE HAS CREATED
THE PERFECT WOMAN.

549
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:28,293
HER ONLY FLAW...

550
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,629
SHE'S NOT HUMAN.

551
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,843
PHYSICALLY HUMAN...

552
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,012
BUT NOT HUMAN.

553
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,765
THESE ARE
EARLIER VERSIONS
OF RAYNA, JIM.

554
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,433
SHE'S AN ANDROID.

555
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,895
Flint: CREATED HERE
BY MY HAND.

556
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,235
HERE THE CENTURIES
OF LONELINESS WERE TO END.

557
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,280
YOUR COLLECTION
OF LEONARDO DA VINCI
MASTERPIECES, MR. FLINT--

558
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,241
THEY APPEAR TO HAVE
BEEN RECENTLY PAINTED

559
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:04,496
ON CONTEMPORARY CANVAS
WITH CONTEMPORARY
MATERIALS.

560
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,456
AND ON YOUR PIANO...

561
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,500
A WALTZ
BY JOHANNES BRAHMS--

562
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,462
AN UNKNOWN WORK
IN MANUSCRIPT

563
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,674
WRITTEN IN MODERN INK,
YET ABSOLUTELY AUTHENTIC,

564
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,926
AS ARE YOUR PAINTINGS.

565
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,263
I...

566
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,016
AM BRAHMS.

567
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,604
AND DA VINCI.

568
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,356
YES.

569
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,860
HOW MANY OTHER NAMES
SHALL WE CALL YOU?

570
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,863
SOLOMON,
ALEXANDER, LAZARUS,

571
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,865
METHUSELAH,
MERLIN, OBBRUMSON,

572
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,700
100 OTHER NAMES
YOU DO NOT KNOW.

573
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,952
YOU WERE BORN...

574
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,913
IN THAT REGION OF EARTH
LATER CALLED MESOPOTAMIA

575
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,875
IN THE YEAR 3834 B.C.,

576
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,585
AS THE MILLENNIA
ARE RECKONED.

577
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:56,756
I WAS OCARIN--

578
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,675
A SOLDIER, A BULLY,
AND A FOOL.

579
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,556
I FELL IN BATTLE,
PIERCED IN THE HEART...

580
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,892
AND DID NOT DIE.

581
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,268
McCoy: INSTANT
TISSUE REGENERATION,

582
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:13,148
COUPLED WITH SOME PERFECT FORM
OF BIOLOGICAL RENEWAL.

583
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,525
YOU LEARNED
THAT YOU WERE IMMORTAL AND--

584
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,902
AND TO CONCEAL IT--

585
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:20,530
TO LIVE SOME
PORTION OF A LIFE...

586
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,908
TO PRETEND TO AGE
AND THEN MOVE ON

587
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,160
BEFORE MY NATURE
WAS SUSPECTED.

588
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,913
YOUR WEALTH
AND YOUR INTELLECT

589
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,541
ARE THE PRODUCT
OF CENTURIES
OF ACQUISITION.

590
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:35,128
YOU KNEW THE GREATEST
MINDS IN HISTORY.

591
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:38,965
GALILEO, SOCRATES,
MOSES.

592
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,718
I HAVE MARRIED
A HUNDRED TIMES, CAPTAIN--

593
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,303
SELECTED,
LOVED, CHERISHED,

594
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:49,017
CARESSED A SMOOTHNESS,
INHALED A BRIEF FRAGRANCE...

595
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:54,981
THEN AGE, DEATH,
THE TASTE OF DUST.

596
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,275
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

597
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,614
Spock: YOU WANTED
A PERFECT ULTIMATE
WOMAN...

598
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,574
AS BRILLIANT...

599
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:07,577
AS IMMORTAL
AS YOURSELF.

600
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:11,581
YOUR MATE
FOR ALL TIME.

601
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,792
DESIGNED
BY MY HEART.

602
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,795
I COULD NOT
LOVE HER MORE.

603
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,297
SPOCK, YOU KNEW?

604
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,008
I HAD HOPED
I WAS WRONG.

605
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,384
YOU CANNOT LOVE
AN ANDROID, CAPTAIN.

606
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,970
I LOVE HER.

607
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,596
SHE IS MY HANDIWORK,
MY PROPERTY.

608
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,140
SHE IS WHAT I DESIRE.

609
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,850
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE
TO LEARN THIS?

610
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,644
DOES SHE KNOW?

611
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,604
SHE WILL NEVER KNOW.

612
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,481
LET'S GO.

613
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,066
YOU WILL STAY.

614
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,652
WHY?

615
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,446
WE HAVE DISCOVERED
WHAT HE IS, CAPTAIN.

616
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,031
IF YOU LEAVE,

617
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,658
THE CURIOUS
WOULD FOLLOW--

618
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,702
THE FOOLISH, THE MEDDLERS,
THE OFFICIALS, THE SEEKERS.

619
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,663
MY PRIVACY WAS MY OWN.

620
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,832
ITS INVASION WILL
BE ON YOUR HEAD.

621
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,208
WE CAN REMAIN
SILENT.

622
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,043
THE DISASTER
OF INTERVENTION, SPOCK--

623
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,838
I'VE KNOWN IT.
I WILL NOT RISK IT.

624
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,631
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

625
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,638
CLEAR OUT OF THE AREA.
INFORM STARFLEET COMMAND.

626
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,640
"ENTERPRISE"!

627
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,225
SCOTTY!

628
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,853
THEY CANNOT ANSWER,
CAPTAIN.

629
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:19,274
[LOUD WHIRRING]

630
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,417
MY CREW.

631
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,296
THE TEST OF POWER.
YOU HAD NO CHANCE.

632
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,719
IT IS TIME FOR YOU
TO JOIN YOUR CREW.

633
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,680
YOU'D WIPE OUT
400 LIVES? WHY?

634
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,058
I HAVE SEEN
100 BILLION FALL.

635
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,601
I KNOW DEATH
BETTER THAN ANY MAN.

636
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,521
I'VE TOSSED ENEMIES
INTO HIS GRASP...

637
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,565
AND I KNOW MERCY.

638
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,943
YOUR CREW IS NOT DEAD,
BUT SUSPENDED.

639
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,570
WORSE THAN DEAD!

640
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,572
RESTORE THEM.
RESTORE MY SHIP!

641
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,533
IN TIME--A THOUSAND,
TWO THOUSAND YEARS.

642
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,078
YOU WILL
KNOW THE FUTURE,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

643
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,247
YOU HAVE BEEN
SUCH MEN.

644
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:18,041
YOU'VE KNOWN
AND CREATED
SUCH BEAUTY.

645
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,876
YOU'VE WATCHED
YOUR RACE EVOLVE

646
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,460
FROM CRUELTY
AND BARBARISM

647
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,879
THROUGHOUT YOUR
ENORMOUS LIFE,

648
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,839
AND YET NOW YOU
WOULD DO THIS
TO US?

649
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,299
THE FLOWERS
OF MY PAST.

650
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,509
I HOLD THE NETTLES
OF THE PRESENT.

651
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,511
I AM FLINT NOW
WITH MY NEEDS!

652
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,138
WHAT NEEDS?

653
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,723
TONIGHT...

654
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,308
I HAVE SEEN
SOMETHING WONDROUS--

655
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,643
SOMETHING
I'VE WAITED FOR,
LABORED FOR.

656
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,312
NOTHING MUST
ENDANGER IT.

657
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:42,690
AT LAST RAYNA'S
EMOTIONS HAVE
STIRRED TO LIFE.

658
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,317
NOW THEY WILL
TURN TO ME

659
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,944
IN THIS SOLITUDE
WHICH I PRESERVE.

660
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,404
Rayna: NO.

661
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,282
RAYNA.

662
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,783
YOU MUST NOT
DO THIS TO THEM.

663
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,077
I MUST.

664
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,746
WHAT WILL YOU
FEEL FOR HIM
AFTER WE ARE GONE?

665
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,465
ALL EMOTIONS ARE
IN PLAY, MR. FLINT.

666
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,176
YOU HARM US,
SHE HATES YOU.

667
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,472
GIVE ME BACK
MY SHIP.

668
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,058
YOUR SECRET IS
SAFE WITH US.

669
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,122
THAT'S WHY
YOU DELAYED

670
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,333
THE PROCESSING
OF THE RYETALYN.

671
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,629
YOU REALIZED
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

672
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,674
YOU KEPT US
TOGETHER--
RAYNA AND ME...

673
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,137
BECAUSE YOU KNEW

674
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,722
I COULD BRING
HER EMOTIONS ALIVE.

675
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:03,188
AND NOW YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO TAKE OVER.

676
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,564
I SHALL TAKE
WHAT IS MINE...

677
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,942
WHEN SHE COMES
TO ME.

678
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,028
WE ARE
MATED, CAPTAIN--
ALIKE, IMMORTAL.

679
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,405
YOU MUST FORGET
YOUR FEELINGS
IN THIS MATTER,

680
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,073
WHICH IS
QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR YOU.

681
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,117
IMPOSSIBLE!

682
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,077
IMPOSSIBLE.

683
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,830
FROM THE BEGINNING,
YOU USED ME.

684
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,382
I CAN'T LOVE HER...

685
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,385
BUT I DO LOVE HER.

686
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,973
AND SHE LOVES ME.

687
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,975
NO!

688
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,769
CAPTAIN, YOUR
PRIMITIVE IMPULSES

689
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,855
WILL NOT ALTER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

690
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,232
STAY OUT OF THIS.
WE'RE FIGHTING OVER A WOMAN.

691
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,650
NO, YOU'RE NOT
FOR SHE IS NOT.

692
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,709
I...

693
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,669
CANNOT BE THE CAUSE
OF THIS.

694
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,674
I WILL NOT BE THE CAUSE
OF THIS!

695
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,308
PLEASE STOP.

696
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,229
Rayna: STOP!

697
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,065
I CHOOSE...

698
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,442
WHERE I WANT TO GO...

699
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:33,027
WHAT I WANT TO DO.

700
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,364
I CHOOSE.

701
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,538
I...

702
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,039
CHOOSE.

703
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,041
RAYNA!

704
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,667
NO.

705
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,836
DO NOT ORDER ME.

706
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,508
NO ONE CAN
ORDER ME.

707
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,469
SHE'S HUMAN.

708
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,597
DOWN TO THE LAST
BLOOD CELL,

709
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:02,223
SHE'S HUMAN.

710
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,267
DOWN TO THE LAST
THOUGHT.

711
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,102
HOPE, ASPIRATION,
EMOTION. SHE'S HUMAN!

712
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,065
Kirk: THE HUMAN SPIRIT
IS FREE.

713
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,276
YOU HAVE NO POWER
OF OWNERSHIP.

714
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,987
SHE'S FREE TO DO
AS SHE WISHES.

715
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,531
GENTLEMEN,
I URGE YOU
TO STOP.

716
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,907
THERE IS
A DANGER.

717
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,909
NO MAN BEATS ME.

718
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,579
I DON'T WANT
TO BEAT YOU.

719
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,000
THIS IS
NO TEST OF POWER.

720
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,377
RAYNA BELONGS
TO HERSELF,

721
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:35,798
AND SHE CLAIMS
THE HUMAN RIGHT OF CHOICE...

722
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,800
TO BE...

723
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,386
AS SHE WILLS...

724
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,222
TO DO AS SHE WILLS,
TO THINK AS SHE WILLS!

725
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,767
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE WORKED FOR.

726
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,688
RAYNA...

727
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:54,317
COME WITH ME.

728
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,695
STAY.

729
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,247
I...

730
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,250
WAS NOT...

731
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,838
HUMAN.

732
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,174
NOW...

733
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:21,260
I...

734
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,054
LOVE.

735
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,059
I...

736
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,935
LOVE.

737
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,997
YOU CAN'T DIE.

738
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,962
WHAT HAPPENED?

739
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,673
SHE LOVED YOU,
CAPTAIN.

740
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,218
AND YOU, TOO,
MR. FLINT,

741
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,680
AS A MENTOR--
EVEN AS A FATHER.

742
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,434
THERE WAS NOT
ENOUGH TIME FOR HER

743
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,977
TO ADJUST
TO THE AWFUL POWER
AND CONTRADICTIONS

744
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,396
OF HER NEWFOUND
EMOTIONS.

745
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:17,692
SHE COULD NOT BEAR
TO HURT EITHER
OF YOU.

746
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,238
THE JOYS OF LOVE
MADE HER HUMAN,

747
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,989
AND THE AGONIES
OF LOVE

748
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,782
DESTROYED HER.

749
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,719
SPOCK.

750
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,513
THE EPIDEMIC
IS REDUCED

751
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,348
AND NO LONGER
A THREAT.

752
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,560
THE "ENTERPRISE" IS
ON COURSE 513
MARK 7,

753
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,312
AS YOU ORDERED.

754
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,275
A VERY OLD...

755
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,153
AND LONELY MAN...

756
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,573
AND A YOUNG...

757
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,742
AND LONELY MAN.

758
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:12,163
WE PUT ON A PRETTY POOR
SHOW, DIDN'T WE?

759
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,377
IF ONLY
I COULD FORGET.

760
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,385
JIM--

761
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,890
OH. THANK HEAVEN.
SLEEPING AT LAST.

762
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,102
YOUR REPORT, DOCTOR.

763
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:39,524
OH. THOSE TRICORDER
READINGS ON MR. FLINT
ARE FINALLY CORRELATED.

764
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,108
HE'S DYING.

765
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,194
SEE, FLINT,
IN LEAVING EARTH

766
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,196
WITH ALL OF ITS
COMPLEX FIELDS

767
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,031
WITHIN WHICH
HE WAS FORMED,

768
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,533
SACRIFICED
IMMORTALITY.

769
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,284
HE'LL LIVE
THE REMAINDER

770
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,744
OF A NORMAL
LIFE SPAN, THEN DIE.

771
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:52,745
ON THAT DAY,
I SHALL MOURN.

772
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:55,748
DOES HE KNOW?

773
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,208
YES. I TOLD HIM
MYSELF.

774
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,335
HE INTENDS TO DEVOTE

775
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,212
THE REMAINDER
OF HIS YEARS
AND GREAT ABILITIES

776
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,964
TO THE IMPROVEMENT
OF THE HUMAN
CONDITION,

777
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,800
AND WHO KNOWS
WHAT HE MIGHT
COME UP WITH?

778
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,092
INDEED.

779
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,222
WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S ALL.

780
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,808
I CAN TELL JIM
LATER, OR YOU CAN.

781
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,395
CONSIDERING
HIS OPPONENT'S
LONGEVITY...

782
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,441
TRULY AN ETERNAL
TRIANGLE.

783
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:27,154
YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT,
WOULD YOU, SPOCK?

784
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,449
YOU SEE, I FEEL
SORRIER FOR YOU
THAN I DO FOR HIM

785
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,909
BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER
KNOW THE THINGS

786
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:36,121
THAT LOVE CAN
DRIVE A MAN TO--

787
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:39,041
THE ECSTASIES,
THE MISERIES,

788
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,001
THE BROKEN RULES,

789
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,629
THE DESPERATE
CHANCES,

790
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,631
THE GLORIOUS
FAILURES,

791
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,551
AND THE GLORIOUS
VICTORIES.

792
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,136
ALL OF THESE THINGS
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW

793
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,055
SIMPLY BECAUSE
THE WORD "LOVE"

794
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,558
ISN'T WRITTEN
INTO YOUR BOOK.

795
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,519
GOOD NIGHT, SPOCK.

796
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,355
GOOD NIGHT, DOCTOR.

797
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,235
I DO WISH HE COULD
FORGET HER.

798
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,437
FORGET.
