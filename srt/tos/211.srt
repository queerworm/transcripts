1
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,133
THEY'RE QUITE LARGE.

2
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,343
7 FEET TALL
IS NOT UNUSUAL.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,804
THEY'RE EXTREMELY
FAST AND STRONG.

4
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,514
LIEUTENANT?

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,603
MAKE NO MISTAKE.
THEY CAN BE HIGHLY
DANGEROUS.

6
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,063
THE CAPELLANS' BASIC
WEAPON--THE KLEEAT.

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,441
AT ANY DISTANCE
UP TO 100 YARDS,
THEY CAN MAKE IT

8
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:28,362
ALMOST AS EFFECTIVE
AGAINST A MAN
AS A PHASER.

9
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,406
IN ADDITION TO THIS,
AN ASSORTMENT OF
SWORDS AND KNIVES.

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,533
[BOATSWAIN'S CALL]

11
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,451
CALL FROM THE BRIDGE,
CAPTAIN.

12
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,161
Sulu: BRIDGE. HELM, SIR.

13
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,913
YES, MR. SULU.
REPORT.

14
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,874
NOW IN STANDARD ORBIT, SIR.

15
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,125
I'VE PINPOINTED THEIR
ENCAMPMENT BELOW.

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,003
VERY GOOD. HAVE THE
TRANSPORTER ROOM STAND BY.

17
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,546
AYE, SIR.

18
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,216
HOW LONG WERE
YOU STATIONED ON
THE PLANET, DOCTOR?

19
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,092
ONLY A FEW MONTHS.

20
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,136
WE FOUND THEM
TOTALLY UNINTERESTED IN
MEDICAL AID OR HOSPITALS.

21
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:57,057
THEY BELIEVE THAT ONLY
THE STRONG SHOULD SURVIVE.

22
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,684
ANALYSIS, GENTLEMEN.

23
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,227
ORDINARILY,
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES,

24
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,605
I WOULD RECOMMEND
A LARGE, WELL-ARMED
LANDING PARTY.

25
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,025
YES, BUT IN THIS CASE,
WITH THE MORE
PEOPLE WE TAKE DOWN,

26
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,903
THE GREATER CHANCE
WE HAVE OF VIOLATING
ONE OF THEIR TABOOS.

27
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,988
AGREED.

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,656
ONCE THEY'VE GOT IT
INTO THEIR HEADS
WE'RE SHOWING FORCE,

29
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,909
YOU CAN FORGET THEM
SIGNING ANY MINING TREATY.

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,451
VERY WELL.

31
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,286
SCOTTY,
YOU'RE IN COMMAND.

32
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,873
BEAR IN MIND THAT
THE KLINGONS HAVE BEEN
SIGHTED IN THIS SECTOR.

33
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,666
WHILE WE'RE NEGOTIATING
DOWN THERE,

34
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,752
WE DON'T WANT THE
ENTERPRISE TO BECOME
AN INCIDENT UP HERE.

35
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,796
Scotty: AYE, SIR.
WE'LL KEEP ON OUR TOES.

36
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,785
Man: HALT!

37
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,541
YOU ARE OF
THE EARTH VESSEL?

38
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,126
I'M CAPTAIN KIRK.

39
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,004
WE COME WITH
OPEN HEARTS

40
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,338
AND HANDS.

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,467
A KLINGON!

42
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,760
GRANT, NO!

43
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,972
DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

44
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,612
Kirk: SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

45
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,163
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE.

46
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,999
ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--

47
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,501
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

48
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:52,047
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

49
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,092
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

50
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,635
CAPTAIN'S LOG--
STARDATE 3497.2.

51
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,138
PLANET CAPELLA IV.

52
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,723
THE RARE MINERAL TOPELINE,

53
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,307
VITAL TO
THE LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEMS

54
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,684
OF PLANETOID COLONIES

55
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,895
HAS BEEN DISCOVERED
IN ABUNDANCE HERE.

56
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,564
OUR MISSION--
OBTAIN A MINING AGREEMENT.

57
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,483
BUT WE HAVE DISCOVERED
A KLINGON AGENT HAS PRECEDED US

58
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,985
TO THE PLANET,

59
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,361
A DISCOVERY WHICH HAS
COST THE LIFE

60
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,279
OF ONE OF MY CREWMEN.

61
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,449
I AM UNAWARE OF ANY
STATE OF WAR

62
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,243
BETWEEN
OUR PEOPLES, CAPTAIN.

63
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,787
JIM!

64
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,041
OR IS IT YOUR POLICY TO
KILL KLINGONS ON SIGHT?

65
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,380
HE WAS YOUNG...

66
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,468
AND INEXPERIENCED!

67
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,680
DOES MAAB KNOW
THAT THE KLINGONS
ARE OUR SWORN ENEMIES,

68
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,682
BY THEIR OWN WORDS?

69
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:29,728
WE UNDERSTAND ONLY THAT
HE ALSO OFFERS THINGS
OF VALUE FOR OUR ROCKS,

70
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,023
THAT HE HAS FREELY
HANDED US HIS WEAPONS
AND OTHER DEVICES.

71
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,155
WILL YOU DO THE SAME?

72
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,994
LET ME CALL MY SHIP
AND INFORM THEM--

73
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,830
TO BRING DOWN AN ATTACK
UPON THEIR VILLAGE?

74
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,582
IT IS AS I TOLD YOU,
MAAB.

75
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,376
EARTH MEN FEAR
TO BARGAIN HONESTLY.

76
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,422
WILL YOU HAND US
YOUR WEAPONS?

77
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,243
SO THEY KEEP THEIR WORD...

78
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,744
SCRUPULOUSLY.

79
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,537
THEY'RE UNUSUALLY HONEST.

80
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,166
IS THAT WHAT I HEARD
YOU SAY IN THE
BRIEFING ROOM, DOCTOR?

81
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,750
YES, I MENTIONED THAT.

82
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,586
HE ALSO MENTIONED
THAT THEY CAN BE
HIGHLY DANGEROUS.

83
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,546
DANGEROUS IF LIED TO,

84
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,174
IF THEIR CUSTOMS
ARE VIOLATED.

85
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,341
BUT WE LIED TO NO ONE,
DOCTOR.

86
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,303
WE VIOLATED NO CUSTOMS.

87
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,638
PERHAPS YOU'LL EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY ONE OF MY MEN IS DEAD.

88
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,474
BECAUSE HE WAS DRAWING
A WEAPON ON ANOTHER
OF THEIR GUESTS.

89
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,019
GRANT LOOKED UP,
SAW A KLINGON,

90
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,147
MADE A PURELY INSTINCTIVE
DEFENSIVE MOVE.

91
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,984
AND WHAT'S A KLINGON
DOING DOWN HERE

92
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,154
AMONG YOUR SCRUPULOUSLY
HONEST FRIENDS ANYWAY?

93
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:09,995
LOOK, JIM, I KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU
TO LOSE A CREWMAN.

94
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,789
THAT'S ONLY ONE DOWN,
DOCTOR.

95
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,542
THERE'S OVER 400 MORE
UP THERE IN ORBIT.

96
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,630
AND IF THERE'S
A KLINGON DOWN HERE,

97
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,425
THERE MIGHT BE
A KLINGON SHIP
UP THERE SOMEWHERE.

98
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,221
MR. SCOTT.

99
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,185
I'M PICKING UP SOMETHING
ON THE SENSORS, SIR.

100
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,728
SEEMS TO BE ANOTHER SHIP.

101
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,897
WELL, LET'S PUT IT
ON THE SCREEN.

102
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:45,239
IT'S JUST AT THE EDGE
OF OUR SENSOR RANGE, SIR.

103
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,032
HARD TO GET
AN EXACT READING.

104
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,577
YOU THINK
IT'S A KLINGON SHIP?

105
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,705
WHO ELSE WOULD BE
PLAYING CAT AND MOUSE
WITH A STARSHIP?

106
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,002
WELL...IT CAN'T HURT
US MUCH OUT THERE

107
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,547
BOBBING ABOUT
LIKE THAT.

108
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,925
NO NEED TO CALL
THE CAPTAIN YET.

109
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,524
BONES...

110
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,321
YES, CAPTAIN?

111
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,074
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
CHEWED YOU OUT.

112
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,034
I'M SORRY.

113
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,535
I UNDERSTAND.

114
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,874
Spock: INEFFICIENT, HOWEVER.

115
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,002
EMOTION, CAPTAIN.

116
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,256
YES, YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT,
MR. SPOCK.

117
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,840
INEFFICIENT...

118
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,219
AND ILLOGICAL.

119
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,438
McCoy: YOU'VE, UH,
SHOWN FRIENDSHIP

120
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,190
BY HANDING OVER
OUR WEAPONS,

121
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,985
AND SHE'S MAKING
A GESTURE IN RETURN.

122
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,657
JIM!

123
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,080
IF YOU TOUCH IT,

124
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,706
HER NEAREST MALE RELATIVE

125
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,667
WILL HAVE TO TRY
TO KILL YOU.

126
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,837
THEY'RE OFFERING YOU
A CHANCE FOR COMBAT.

127
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,589
THEY CONSIDER IT
MORE PLEASURABLE THAN LOVE.

128
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,720
CHURA.

129
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,643
IT WOULD APPEAR,
CAPTAIN,

130
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,481
THAT THEY FIND YOU
A DISAPPOINTMENT.

131
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,330
I AM THE TIER AKAAR.

132
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,458
I LEAD THE 10 TRIBES
OF CAPELLA.

133
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,259
AND THIS IS ELEEN,

134
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,221
A YOUNG WIFE
TO GIVE AN OLD MAN A SON

135
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,097
TO RULE THESE TRIBES.

136
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,392
I'M CAPTAIN KIRK.

137
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,643
FIRST OF ALL, I MUST
PROTEST THE KILLING
OF ONE OF MY CREWMEN.

138
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,354
IF IT WAS YOUR MAN,

139
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,772
WAS IT NOT HIS PRIVILEGE
TO DIE FOR YOU?

140
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,149
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

141
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,901
THEIR CUSTOMS ARE
DIFFERENT, TIER.

142
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,530
AND DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE OF MY PEOPLE,
TOO, TIER.

143
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,656
THE SIGHT OF DEATH
FRIGHTENS THEM.

144
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,450
LET ME TAKE THIS, JIM.

145
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,081
WHAT MAAB HAS SAID
IS TRUE.

146
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,418
OUR CUSTOMS
ARE DIFFERENT.

147
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,921
WHAT THE KLINGON HAS SAID
IS UNIMPORTANT,

148
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,382
AND WE DO NOT
HEAR HIS WORDS.

149
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,801
- HA HA HA!
- HA HA HA!

150
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,097
I JUST CALLED
THE KLINGON A LIAR.

151
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,432
Maab: LAUGHTER, TIER?

152
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,850
IS NOT THE KLINGON
AN HONORED GUEST ALSO?

153
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,104
IT WAS THE EARTH PEOPLE
WHO FIRST BARGAINED
FOR OUR ROCKS.

154
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,399
IS IT NOT BEST
TO HAVE TWO WHO BARGAIN
FOR THE SAME GOODS?

155
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,318
IT IS I WHO SPEAK
FOR THE TRIBE, MAAB.

156
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,238
I SPEAK FOR MANY, TIER.

157
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,365
HEAR THE WORDS
OF THE KLINGON.

158
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,537
WHAT DO EARTH MEN
OFFER YOU?

159
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,874
WHAT HAVE YOU OBTAINED
FROM THEM IN THE PAST?

160
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,462
POWDERS AND LIQUIDS
FOR THE SICK?

161
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,505
HA HA HA.

162
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,383
WE KLINGONS
BELIEVE AS YOU DO.

163
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,510
THE SICK SHOULD DIE.

164
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,720
ONLY THE STRONG
SHOULD LIVE.

165
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,307
EARTH MEN HAVE PROMISED
TO TEACH THE YOUTH
OF YOUR TRIBES

166
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,892
MANY THINGS.

167
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,561
WHAT?

168
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,105
WHAT THINGS?

169
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,150
CLEVERNESS
AGAINST ENEMIES?

170
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,776
THE USE OF WEAPONS?

171
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,071
THE KLINGON SPEAKS
THE TRUTH, AKAAR.

172
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,412
THE EARTH FEDERATION

173
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:07,292
OFFERS ONE OTHER THING,
AKAAR--

174
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,169
OUR LAWS.

175
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,172
AND THE HIGHEST
OF ALL OUR LAWS STATES

176
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,715
THAT YOUR WORLD
IS YOURS

177
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,426
AND WILL ALWAYS
REMAIN YOURS.

178
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,262
THIS DIFFERS US
FROM THE KLINGONS.

179
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,640
THEIR EMPIRE IS MADE UP
OF CONQUERED WORLDS.

180
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,933
THEY TAKE WHAT THEY WANT
BY ARMS AND FORCE.

181
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,477
GOOD, GOOD.

182
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,813
LET THE KLINGONS
AND THE EARTH MEN
OFFER US AMUSEMENT.

183
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,731
CAPELLANS
WELCOME THIS.

184
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,485
THE EARTH MEN HAVE
DIFFERENT CUSTOMS,

185
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,612
BUT NEVER HAVE THEY
LIED TO OUR PEOPLE.

186
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:39,366
THERE ARE THOSE OF US
WHO WILL NOT BARGAIN
WITH EARTH MEN, AKAAR.

187
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:46,540
DO YOU SAY YOU WILL
FIGHT ME, MAAB?

188
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,255
LET THAT BE
YOUR CHOICE, TIER.

189
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,478
WE NEED
OUR COMMUNICATORS,

190
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,021
THOSE DEVICES
ON OUR BELTS.

191
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,190
IF THERE'S
A KLINGON SHIP
SOMEWHERE--

192
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,318
THE SKY
DOES NOT INTEREST ME.

193
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,154
I MUST CONSIDER THE WORDS
I HAVE HEARD.

194
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,786
LEAVE HIM.

195
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,890
THE SHIP'S
DISAPPEARED, SIR.

196
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,601
GONE OUT OF RANGE.

197
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,607
MR. SCOTT,
I'M GETTING A CALL
FROM A VESSEL.

198
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,609
IT'S SO FAINT,
I CAN'T MAKE IT OUT.

199
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,775
PUT A BOOSTER ON IT,
LIEUTENANT.

200
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,861
TRY TO PULL IT IN.

201
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,073
I'VE LOST IT.

202
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,619
IT SOUNDED LIKE
A DISTRESS SIGNAL
FROM AN EARTH VESSEL.

203
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,756
KLINGON!

204
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,508
COMMUNICATORS, WEAPONS.

205
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,760
I HAVE NO QUARREL
WITH YOU, CAPTAIN.

206
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,179
I WISH MERELY TO...

207
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,972
TO RETURN TO MY VESSEL.

208
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,937
TYPE OF VESSEL.
LOCATION.

209
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,358
A SMALL SCOUT SHIP,
CAPTAIN.

210
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,027
WE NEED THE MINERAL, TOO.

211
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,488
I WAS SENT TO NEGOTIATE.

212
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,198
RELEASE HIM.

213
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,840
AKAAR IS DEAD.

214
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,426
I AM THE TIER.

215
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,636
KILL THEM NOW.

216
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,846
WAIT.

217
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,019
IF YOU LEAD
THESE PEOPLE NOW,

218
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,773
BE CERTAIN YOU MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISIONS.

219
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,819
IS THE NEW LEADER
OF THE 10 TRIBES AFRAID?

220
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,195
LET ME KILL HIM
FOR YOU.

221
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,197
OR LET THE KLINGON
AND ME FIGHT.

222
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,657
IT MIGHT AMUSE YOU.

223
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,623
PERHAPS TO BE A TIER
IS TO SEE IN NEW WAYS.

224
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,754
I BEGIN TO LIKE YOU,
EARTH MAN...

225
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:25,091
AND I SAW FEAR
IN THE KLINGON'S EYE.

226
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,967
WE HAD AN AGREEMENT.

227
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,558
THAT, TOO,
MAY CHANGE, KLINGON.

228
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,189
I HAVE THE SIGNAL CLEAR
NOW, MR. SCOTT.

229
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,777
IT IS A DISTRESS CALL.
IT'S FROM THE S.S. DIERDRE.

230
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,528
THE DIERDRE?

231
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,696
THAT'S A FREIGHTER.

232
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,239
REPORTING
THEY'RE UNDER ATTACK.

233
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,741
THEY'RE RUNNING...

234
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,034
TRYING TO MANEUVER...

235
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,621
IT'S A KLINGON VESSEL
ATTACKING.

236
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,459
HELM?

237
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,585
PICKING IT UP, SIR.

238
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,337
TAKING A FIX.

239
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,339
TRY THE CAPTAIN.

240
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,717
ENTERPRISE
TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

241
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,261
COME IN, CAPTAIN.

242
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,638
ENTERPRISE
TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

243
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,055
COME IN, CAPTAIN.

244
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,442
AAH!

245
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,777
Spock: CAPTAIN, CAREFUL.

246
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,742
YOU CARRY A CHILD
WHO WOULD BE TIER.

247
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,619
I MUST DIE.

248
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,583
NO!

249
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,201
NO MAN MAY TOUCH
THE WIFE OF A TIER.

250
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:21,958
SHE WAS PREPARED TO DIE,
EARTH MAN.

251
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,252
I WAS PROUD
TO OBEY THE LAWS.

252
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,838
KILL HIM FIRST.

253
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,509
HE LAID HANDS UPON ME.

254
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,428
IT IS MY RIGHT
TO SEE HIM DIE.

255
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,436
ENTERPRISE
TO MR. SPOCK.

256
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,316
DR. McCOY,
COME IN, PLEASE.

257
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,990
I HAVE IT
ON THE SENSORS, SIR.

258
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,742
TIE IN TO MY CHANNEL,
LIEUTENANT.

259
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,910
Uhura: TIED IN.

260
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,327
Man: COMMANDING.

261
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,954
WE ARE UNDER HEAVY ATTACK
BY KLINGON VESSELS.

262
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,206
TWO CONVOY SHIPS
ARE ALREADY DAMAGED.

263
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,583
WE MUST HAVE HELP.

264
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,084
ENTERPRISE, ACKNOWLEDGE.

265
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,293
PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE.

266
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,670
REPEAT--

267
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,430
INTERCEPTION COURSE
COMPUTED

268
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,139
AND LAID IN, SIR.

269
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,310
PREPARE TO TAKE US
OUT OF ORBIT, MR. SULU.

270
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,021
AYE, SIR.

271
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,192
SCOTTY...

272
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,402
THE CAPTAIN.

273
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,695
WE HAVE A DISTRESS CALL

274
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,781
FROM A FEDERATION SHIP
UNDER ATTACK.

275
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,033
THAT'S WHERE
OUR DUTY LIES.

276
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,416
TAKE US OUT OF ORBIT,
MR. SULU.

277
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,293
AHEAD WARP 5.

278
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,724
Scotty: CAPTAIN'S LOG--
STARDATE 3498.9,

279
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,435
LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER SCOTT
IN TEMPORARY COMMAND.

280
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,853
WE WERE FORCED
TO LEAVE CAPELLA

281
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,772
TO COME TO THE AID
OF A FEDERATION VESSEL

282
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,650
UNDER ATTACK
BY A KLINGON VESSEL.

283
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,909
WE WERE UNABLE TO CONTACT
OUR LANDING PARTY

284
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:23,245
BEFORE WE WERE FORCED TO
ANSWER THE DISTRESS SIGNAL.

285
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,372
OUR INABILITY TO REACH
THE LANDING PARTY

286
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,041
IS STRANGE...

287
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,794
AND I AM CONCERNED.

288
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,131
OUR CHECK-IN SIGNAL

289
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,759
IS 1 HOUR, 12 MINUTES
OVERDUE.

290
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,762
SINCE NO RECONNAISSANCE
PARTY HAS APPEARED,

291
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:43,516
AND SINCE MR. SCOTT
IS NOTABLY EFFICIENT
IN SUCH MATTERS...

292
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,393
I MUST ASSUME
THAT SOMETHING'S
KEEPING THEM BUSY

293
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,728
UP THERE.

294
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,481
THE KLINGON SHIP.

295
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,027
THAT WOULD SEEM
A LOGICAL CONCLUSION.

296
00:19:55,486 --> 00:20:00,074
CAPTAIN, I'M GOING TO
FIX THAT WOMAN'S ARM.

297
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,161
THEY CAN ONLY
KILL ME ONCE
FOR TOUCHING HER.

298
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,044
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA,
BONES.

299
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,879
YES, CAPTAIN,

300
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,214
AN EXCELLENT IDEA.

301
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,183
LET ME SEE
THAT ARM.

302
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,101
YOU WILL NOT
TOUCH ME.

303
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,821
YOU SAY
YOU'RE PREPARED TO DIE.

304
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,199
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU PREFER TO DIE?

305
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,450
I THINK WE CAN GET YOU
SAFELY TO THE SHIP.

306
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,454
YOUR CHOICE? BONES.

307
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,165
TO LIVE...

308
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:53,586
IS ALWAYS DESIRABLE.

309
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,587
ALL RIGHT.

310
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,047
LET'S GO.

311
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,103
KLINGON...

312
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,566
THERE'S NOTHING
TO CONCERN YOU THERE.

313
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,117
WE'VE MADE
AN AGREEMENT, MAAB.

314
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,246
I HAVE A RIGHT
TO MY WEAPONS.

315
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,082
WE HAVE THEM
WELL-CARED FOR,
KLINGON.

316
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,666
YOUR WEAPON
WILL BE RETURNED

317
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,002
WHEN OUR BUSINESS
IS COMPLETED.

318
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,881
THAT WAS OUR AGREEMENT.

319
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:42,468
Man: AFT PHASER CONFIRMING.
ENGINEERING TO BRIDGE.

320
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,596
APPROACHING THE FREIGHTER'S
LAST REPORTED POSITION, SIR.

321
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,556
SENSOR REPORT,
MR. CHEKOV.

322
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,682
NEGATIVE, SIR.

323
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,227
NO DEBRIS,
NO RESIDUAL PARTICLES,

324
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,519
NO TRACES.

325
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,522
MR. SULU,
BEGIN A STANDARD
SEARCH PATTERN.

326
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:59,693
ALL SCANNERS
FULL INTENSITY,
MR. CHEKOV.

327
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,612
NO SIGNAL AT ALL?

328
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,696
NEGATIVE, SIR.

329
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,865
IT SHOULD BE
ON OUR SCREENS BY NOW.

330
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:08,535
AT BEST, A FREIGHTER
MIGHT TRAVEL WARP 2.

331
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,330
I'M WELL AWARE
OF A FREIGHTER'S
MAXIMUM SPEED,

332
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,124
MR. SULU.

333
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,633
Kirk, voice-over:
CAPTAIN'S LOG--STARDATE 3499.1.

334
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,551
BEFORE LEAVING
THE CAPELLAN ENCAMPMENT,

335
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,345
WE MANAGED TO RETRIEVE
OUR COMMUNICATORS.

336
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,347
OUR PHASERS
WERE NOT TO BE FOUND.

337
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,808
WE HAVE FLED INTO THE HILLS,

338
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,227
YET WE KNOW THE CAPELLANS
WILL EVENTUALLY FIND US

339
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,604
BY SCENT ALONE,
IF NECESSARY.

340
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,606
AND WE HAVE LEARNED
ONE THING MORE.

341
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,066
THE GIRL ELEEN

342
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,360
HATES THE UNBORN CHILD
SHE IS CARRYING.

343
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,737
STAY WITH HER,
BONES.

344
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,622
NICE PLACE
TO GET TRAPPED IN.

345
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,042
BUT A DEFENSIBLE ENTRANCE,
CAPTAIN.

346
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,589
YES, I SEE.

347
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,008
SCOUT UP THE TRAIL
THAT WAY.

348
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,968

HAVE IN THE WAY
OF AN EXIT.

I'LL TAKE
A LOOK AROUND.

350
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,556
NOW LISTEN, YOU MAY BE
A CAPELLAN WOMAN

351
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,558
AND THE WIDOW
OF A HIGH TIER,

352
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,185
BUT I'M A DOCTOR,

353
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,812
AND IT'S MY TRADITION TO CARE
FOR THE SICK AND INJURED.

354
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,155

THAT ARM.

356
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,870

IN THAT MANNER.

358
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,874
I'LL TOUCH YOU
IN ANY WAY OR MANNER

359
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,835
THAT MY PROFESSIONAL
JUDGMENT INDICATES.

360
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,636
OHH!

361
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,438
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

362
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,481
IT CAN COME
ANYTIME NOW.

363
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,277
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

364
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,447
BECAUSE I'M A DOCTOR,
THAT'S HOW I KNOW.

00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,992

OF OUR VILLAGE

366
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,577

WITH A TOUCH.

367
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,458

368
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,252
AND VERY SOFT.

AND NARROWER,

BUT THERE IS
A WAY OUT.

371
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,529

BLOCK OFF THAT ENTRANCE,

372
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,865
HOLD THEM OFF,
IT WOULD GIVE US MORE TIME.

373
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,450
THEY'D HAVE TO GO
AROUND THESE HILLS.

THERE IS ENOUGH

00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,120
DO YOU THINK WE COULD CREATE
A SONIC DISRUPTION

376
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,622
WITH 2 OF
OUR COMMUNICATORS?

377
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,624
ONLY A VERY
SLIGHT CHANCE
IT WOULD WORK.

378
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,918
WELL, IF YOU DON'T THINK
WE CAN, MAYBE WE
SHOULDN'T TRY.

SAY THAT EXACTLY.

TO HANDLE AN EMERGENCY.

YOU CAN HANDLE IT...

I CAN DO IT.

393
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,536
THE LAST THING
I WANT AROUND

394
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,288
IS A HAM-HANDED
SHIP'S CAPTAIN.
