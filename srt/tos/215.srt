1
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,595
DEEP SPACE STATION K-7

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,847
NOW WITHIN
SENSOR RANGE, CAPTAIN.

3
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:16,433
GOOD. MR. CHEKOV,
THIS FLIGHT IS
SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,352
BOTH EXPERIENCE
AND KNOWLEDGE.

5
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,188
HOW CLOSE WILL
WE COME TO THE NEAREST
KLINGON OUTPOST

6
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,857
IF WE CONTINUE ON
OUR PRESENT COURSE?

7
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,441
ONE PARSEC, SIR.

8
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,527
CLOSE ENOUGH
TO SMELL THEM.

9
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,111
THAT IS ILLOGICAL, ENSIGN.

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,656
ODORS CANNOT TRAVEL
THROUGH THE VACUUM OF SPACE.

11
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,492
I WAS MAKING
A LITTLE JOKE, SIR.

12
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,785
EXTREMELY LITTLE,
ENSIGN.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,539
MR. SPOCK, IMMEDIATE
PAST HISTORY
OF THE QUADRANT?

14
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,833
UNDER DISPUTE
BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES

15
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,417
SINCE INITIAL CONTACT.

16
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,420
THE BATTLE OF DONATU-5
WAS FOUGHT NEAR HERE

17
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,422
23 SOLAR YEARS AGO.
INCONCLUSIVE.

18
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,257
ANALYSIS OF
DISPUTED AREA?

19
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,968
UNDEVELOPED.
SHERMAN'S PLANET

20
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,427
IS CLAIMED BY BOTH
SIDES--OUR FEDERATION

21
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,513
AND THE KLINGON EMPIRE.

22
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,848
WE DO HAVE THE BETTER CLAIM.

23
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,265
THE AREA
WAS FIRST MAPPED

24
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,642
BY THE FAMOUS
RUSSIAN ASTRONOMER
IVAN BORKOV

25
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,643
ALMOST 200--

26
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,603
JOHN BURKE.

27
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,731
BURKE, SIR?

28
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:06,191
I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M SURE IT WAS--

29
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,694
JOHN BURKE
WAS THE CHIEF ASTRONOMER

30
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,112
AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY
IN OLD BRITAIN AT THE TIME.

31
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,448
OH, ROYAL ACADEMY.

32
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,034
OH, WELL...

33
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,037
IS THE REST
OF YOUR HISTORY
THAT FAULTY, ENSIGN?

34
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,955
KEY POINTS OF DISPUTE?

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,498
UNDER THE TERMS OF
THE ORGANIAN PEACE TREATY,

36
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,834
ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
MUST PROVE

37
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,169
IT CAN DEVELOP THE PLANET
MOST EFFICIENTLY.

38
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,381
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
THOUGH THE KLINGONS
ARE BRUTAL AND AGGRESSIVE,

39
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,050
THEY ARE MOST EFFICIENT.

40
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,219
I REMEMBER ONCE PETER
THE GREAT HAD A PROBLEM
LIKE THAT. HE--

41
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,930
Uhura: CAPTAIN?

42
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,848
KIRK HERE.

43
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,808
CAPTAIN, I'M PICKING UP
A SUB-SPACE DISTRESS CALL.

44
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:43,020
PRIORITY CHANNEL. IT'S
FROM SPACE STATION K-7.

45
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,438
GO TO WARP FACTOR SIX.

46
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,941
CODE ONE EMERGENCY.
THAT'S A DISASTER CALL.

47
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,568
Uhura: THIS IS A RED ALERT.
MAN YOUR BATTLE STATIONS.

48
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,111
ALL HANDS.

49
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,497
SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

50
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:12,841
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

51
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,551
ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--

52
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,637
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

53
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:21,016
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

54
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,519
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

55
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,149
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 4523.3.

56
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,609
DEEP SPACE STATION K-7

57
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,153
HAS ISSUED
A PRIORITY ONE CALL.

58
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,988
MORE THAN AN EMERGENCY,

59
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,032
IT SIGNALS
NEAR OR TOTAL DISASTER.

60
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,616
WE CAN ONLY ASSUME

61
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,493
THE KLINGONS
HAVE ATTACKED THE STATION.

62
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,871
WE'RE GOING IN
ARMED FOR BATTLE.

63
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,832
MAIN PHASERS ARMED
AND READY, SIR.

64
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,009
BUT THERE'S
NOTHING THERE.

65
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,594
JUST THE STATION.

66
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,015
PRIORITY ONE
DISTRESS CALL,

67
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,351
AND IT'S JUST
ABSOLUTELY PEACEFUL.

68
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,776
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
BREAK SUB-SPACE SILENCE.

69
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:55,944
AYE, SIR.

70
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,112
THE CHANNEL'S
OPEN, SIR.

71
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,031
SPACE STATION K-7,

72
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,200
THIS IS CAPTAIN KIRK
OF THE "ENTERPRISE."

73
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,743
WHAT IS YOUR EMERGENCY?

74
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,080
CAPTAIN KIRK,
THIS IS MR. LURRY,
MANAGER OF K-7.

75
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,665
I MUST APOLOGIZE FOR
THE DISTRESS CALL.

76
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,835
MR. LURRY, YOU ISSUED
A PRIORITY ONE
DISTRESS CALL.

77
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,962
STATE THE NATURE
OF YOUR EMERGENCY.

78
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:17,091
UH...WELL, PERHAPS
YOU BETTER BEAM OVER.

79
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,800
I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN.

80
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:22,637
YOU'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN.

81
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,432
YOU'D BETTER BE PREPARED
TO DO MORE THAN THAT.

82
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,101
KIRK OUT. MR. SPOCK,
I'LL NEED YOUR HELP.

83
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,936
MR. CHEKOV, MAINTAIN
BATTLE READINESS.

84
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,062
LIEUTENANT UHURA, SEE THAT
THE TRANSPORTER ROOM

85
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,563
IS STANDING BY.

86
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,149
AYE, SIR.
TRANSPORTER ROOM,
STAND BY.

87
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,956
MR. LURRY, IF THERE WAS
NO EMERGENCY,

88
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,540
WHY DID YOU ISSUE

89
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,292
A PRIORITY ONE
DISTRESS CALL?

90
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,628
THAT WAS MY ORDER,
CAPTAIN.

91
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,547
CAPTAIN KIRK,
THIS IS NILZ BARIS.

92
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,382
HE'S OUT FROM EARTH

93
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,468
TO TAKE CHARGE OF
THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
FOR SHERMAN'S PLANET.

94
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,594
AND THAT GIVES YOU
THE AUTHORITY

95
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,930
TO PUT AN ENTIRE QUADRANT
ON DEFENSE ALERT?

96
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,808
MR. BARIS
IS THE FEDERATION
UNDERSECRETARY

97
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,310
IN CHARGE OF
AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS
IN THIS QUADRANT.

98
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,604
THAT GIVES HIM
THE AUTHORITY.

99
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,939
OH.

100
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,607
THIS IS MY ASSISTANT
ARNE DARVIN.

101
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,152
AND THIS IS
MY FIRST OFFICER
MR. SPOCK.

102
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,569
MR. DARVIN.
MR. SPOCK.

103
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,572
AND NOW, CAPTAIN, I WANT ALL
AVAILABLE SECURITY GUARDS.

104
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,826
I WANT THEM POSTED AROUND
THE STORAGE COMPARTMENTS.

105
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,202
STORAGE COMPARTMENTS?
STORAGE COMPARTMENTS?

106
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,328
THE STORAGE
COMPARTMENTS

107
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,038
CONTAINING THE
QUADRO-TRITICALE.

108
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,498
THE WHAT? WHAT?

109
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,793
CAPTAIN.
WHAT'S...
QUADRO-TRITICALE?

110
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,338
WHEAT. SO WHAT?

111
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,134
QUADRO-TRITICALE
IS NOT WHEAT, CAPTAIN.

112
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,303
OF COURSE,
I WOULDN'T EXPECT
YOU OR MR. SPOCK

113
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,387
TO KNOW
ABOUT SUCH THINGS,

114
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,890
BUT QUADRO-TRITICALE
IS A RATHER--

115
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,143
QUADRO-TRITICALE IS
A HIGH-YIELD GRAIN,

116
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,770
4-LOBED HYBRID
OF WHEAT AND RYE.

117
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,272
A PERENNIAL, ALSO,
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

118
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,941
IT'S ROOT GRAIN,
TRITICALE,

119
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,567
CAN TRACE
ITS ANCESTRY

120
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,695
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO 20th CENTURY
CANADA--

121
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,655
MR. SPOCK, YOU'VE
MADE YOUR POINT.

122
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,532
QUADRO-TRITICALE IS
THE ONLY EARTH GRAIN

123
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,741
THAT WILL GROW
ON SHERMAN'S PLANET.

124
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,244
WE HAVE SEVERAL TONS
OF IT HERE ON THE STATION.

125
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,664
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT THAT GRAIN GET TO
SHERMAN'S PLANET SAFELY.

126
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,333
MR. BARIS THINKS

127
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,544
THAT KLINGON AGENTS
MAY TRY TO SABOTAGE IT.

128
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,921
YOU ISSUED A PRIORITY ONE
DISTRESS CALL

129
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,048
FOR A COUPLE OF
TONS OF WHEAT?

130
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,717
QUADRO-TRITICALE!

131
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,677
OF COURSE, CAPTAIN,
I REALIZE THAT WE--

132
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,888
MR. BARIS,
YOU SUMMONED
THE "ENTERPRISE"

133
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,556
WITHOUT
AN EMERGENCY.

134
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,141
YOU'LL TAKE FULL
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR IT.

135
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,684
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

136
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,102
Spock: MISUSE OF
THE PRIORITY
ONE CHANNEL

137
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,687
IS A FEDERATION
OFFENSE.

138
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,439
I DID NOT MISUSE
THE PRIORITY ONE CHANNEL.

139
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,983
I WANT THAT GRAIN
PROTECTED.

140
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,945
CAPTAIN, COULDN'T
YOU AT LEAST POST
A COUPLE OF GUARDS?

141
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,907
WE DO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER
OF SHIPS PASSING THROUGH.

142
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,243
IT WOULD
SEEM A LOGICAL
PRECAUTION, CAPTAIN.

143
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,911
THE SHERMAN'S PLANET
AFFAIR

144
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,330
IS OF
EXTREME IMPORTANCE
TO THE FEDERATION.

145
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,215
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

146
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,423
"ENTERPRISE" HERE.

147
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,009
SECURE
FROM GENERAL QUARTERS.

148
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,428
AND BEAM DOWN TWO,
AND ONLY TWO,
SECURITY GUARDS.

149
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,057
HAVE THEM REPORT
TO MR. LURRY.

150
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,809
AUTHORIZE SHORE LEAVE
FOR ALL OFF-DUTY PERSONNEL.

151
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,270
YES, CAPTAIN.

152
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,146
KIRK OUT.

153
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,690
CAPTAIN KIRK,
HOW DARE YOU AUTHORIZE
A MERE TWO MEN

154
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,067
FOR A PROJECT
OF THIS IMPORTANCE?

155
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,193
STARFLEET COMMAND WILL
HEAR ABOUT THIS.

156
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,070
I HAVE NEVER QUESTIONED

157
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,072
THE ORDERS
OR THE INTELLIGENCE

158
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,117
OF ANY REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE FEDERATION...

159
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,202
UNTIL NOW.

160
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,712
SUMMONING A STARSHIP
ON A PRIORITY A-1 CHANNEL

161
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,339
TO GUARD SOME
STORAGE COMPARTMENTS.

162
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,050
STORAGE COMPARTMENTS
OF WHEAT.

163
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,260
NEVERTHELESS,
CAPTAIN,

164
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,761
THE KLINGONS
WOULD NOT ENJOY

165
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,972
SEEING US
SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP
SHERMAN'S PLANET.

166
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,182
I GUESS NOT.

167
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,355
I SEE YOU DIDN'T
WASTE ANY TIME
TAKING YOUR SHORE LEAVE.

168
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,857
HOW OFTEN DO I
GET SHORE LEAVE?

169
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,236
SHE WANTS TO SHOP,
AND I THOUGHT I
WOULD HELP HER.

170
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,571
OH, EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

171
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,867
MR. CHEKOV, WHAT

592
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:03,116

GOT A FEELING.

IN HAVING ONE.

618
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,484
IT IS A HUMAN
CHARACTERISTIC TO
LOVE LITTLE ANIMALS,

619
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:19,777
ESPECIALLY IF
THEY'RE ATTRACTIVE
IN SOME WAY.

00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,733
WELL,
THE NEAREST THING
I CAN FIGURE OUT

648
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,317
IS THAT THEY'RE
BORN PREGNANT,

REALIZED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,190
IF YOU REMOVED
THE TRIBBLES

683
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,942
FROM THEIR PREDATOR-FILLED
ENVIRONMENT

684
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,736
INTO AN ENVIRONMENT
WHERE THEIR NATURAL
MULTIPLICATIVE PROCLIVITIES

WOULD HAVE
NO RESTRAINING FACTORS.

00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,221
AND TRIBBLES
ARE NOT DANGEROUS.

695
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,472
JUST INCREDIBLY
PROLIFIC.

696
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,726
PRECISELY, AND AT
6 CREDITS A HEAD--

697
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:23,061
UH, WELL,
THAT IS, A BODY,

698
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,564
IT MOUNTS UP. NOW
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

699
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,315
YOU SHOULD
SELL AN INSTRUCTION
AND MAINTENANCE MANUAL

700
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,274
WITH THIS THING.

701
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,276
IF I DID,
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

702
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,611
TO MAN'S SEARCH
FOR KNOWLEDGE?

703
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:35,615
WELL, I MUST BE
TENDING MY SHIP.
AU REVOIR.

704
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,913
GO AHEAD, SIR.
TELL HIM.

705
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:42,831
CAPTAIN KIRK,

706
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,291
I CONSIDER YOUR SECURITY
MEASURES A DISGRACE.

707
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,794
IN MY OPINION,
YOU HAVE TAKEN

708
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,380
THIS ENTIRE VERY
IMPORTANT PROJECT
FAR TOO LIGHTLY.

709
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,882
ON THE CONTRARY, SIR.

710
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,300
I THINK OF THIS PROJECT
AS VERY IMPORTANT.

711
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,261
IT IS YOU
I TAKE LIGHTLY.

712
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,180
I AM GOING
TO REPORT FULLY

713
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,807
TO THE PROPER
AUTHORITIES

714
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,309
THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN
FREE AND COMPLETE ACCESS

715
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,978
TO THIS STATION

716
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,022
TO A MAN WHO IS QUITE
PROBABLY A KLINGON AGENT.

717
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,067
NOW, THAT'S
A VERY SERIOUS CHARGE.
TO WHOM ARE YOU REFERRING?

718
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,736
TO THAT MAN WHO JUST
WALKED OUT OF HERE.

719
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,153
CYRANO JONES?

720
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:14,988
A KLINGON AGENT?

721
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,949
YOU HEARD ME.

722
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:18,366
I HEARD YOU.

723
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,410
HE SIMPLY COULD NOT
BELIEVE HIS EARS.

724
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,123
WHAT EVIDENCE
DO YOU HAVE
AGAINST MR. JONES?

725
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,084
MY ASSISTANT HERE
HAS KEPT MR. JONES

726
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,003
UNDER CLOSE SURVEILLANCE
FOR QUITE SOME TIME,

727
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,505
AND HIS ACTIONS HAVE
BEEN MOST SUSPICIOUS.

728
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,382
I BELIEVE HE WAS
INVOLVED IN THAT
LITTLE ALTERCATION

729
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,509
BETWEEN YOUR MAN
AND THE MAN
FROM HIS SHIP--

730
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,261
YES, YES. GO ON.
WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE?

731
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,763
WELL, CAPTAIN,
I CHECKED
HIS SHIP'S LOG.

732
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,515
AND IT SEEMS
THAT HE WAS WITHIN
THE KLINGONS'

733
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,559
SPHERE OF
INFLUENCE LESS THAN
FOUR MONTHS AGO.

734
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,269
THE MAN IS
AN INDEPENDENT
SCOUT, CAPTAIN.

735
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,606
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT
HE IS ALSO A KLINGON SPY.

736
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,652
WE HAVE ALREADY CHECKED
ON THE BACKGROUND

737
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,278
OF MR. CYRANO JONES.

738
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,697
HE IS A LICENSED
ASTEROID LOCATOR
AND PROSPECTOR.

739
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,157
HE'S NEVER
BROKEN THE LAW,

740
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,242
AT LEAST NOT SEVERELY.

741
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,327
AND FOR THE PAST
SEVEN YEARS

742
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,496
WITH HIS
ONE-MAN SPACESHIP,

743
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,081
HE HAS OBTAINED
A MARGINAL LIVING

744
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,458
BY ENGAGING IN
THE BUYING AND SELLING
OF RARE MERCHANDISE,

745
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,252
INCLUDING,
UNFORTUNATELY, TRIBBLES.

746
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,338
BUT HE IS AFTER MY GRAIN!

747
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,007
DO YOU HAVE
ANY PROOF OF THAT?

748
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:17,300
YOU CAN'T DENY
HE'S DISRUPTED
THIS STATION.

749
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,636
PEOPLE HAVE DISRUPTED
STATIONS BEFORE

750
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,262
WITHOUT BEING
KLINGON AGENTS.

751
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,640
SOMETIMES, ALL THEY NEED
IS A TITLE, MR. BARIS.

752
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,976
UNFORTUNATELY, DISRUPTING
A SPACE STATION

753
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,477
IS NOT AN OFFENSE.

754
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,561
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

755
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,773
I HAVE A SHIP
TO TEND TO. AU REVOIR.

756
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,756
MY CHICKEN SANDWICH
AND COFFEE.

757
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,510
THIS IS MY CHICKEN
SANDWICH AND COFFEE.

758
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,427
FASCINATING.

759
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,221
I WANT THESE THINGS
OFF THE SHIP.

760
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,598
I DON'T CARE IF IT TAKES
EVERY MAN WE'VE GOT.
I WANT THEM OFF THE SHIP.

761
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,729
AYE. THEY'RE INTO
THE MACHINERY, ALL
RIGHT. AND THEY'RE

762
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,689
PROBABLY IN
ALL THE OTHER FOOD
PROCESSORS, TOO.

763
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:13,899
HOW?

764
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,151
PROBABLY THROUGH ONE
OF THE AIR VENTS.

765
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,111
CAPTAIN, THERE ARE
VENTS OF THAT TYPE

766
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,821
ON THE SPACE STATION.

767
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,614
AND IN THE STORAGE
COMPARTMENTS.

768
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,494
THIS IS KIRK.

769
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,372
CONTACT MANAGER LURRY
AND NILZ BARIS.

770
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,416
HAVE THEM MEET US NEAR
THE STORAGE COMPARTMENTS.

771
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,627
WE'RE BEAMING DOWN.
COME ON, SPOCK.

772
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,558
ENERGIZE.

773
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,945
[SHRIEKING]

774
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,279
WHAT'S WRONG?

775
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,865
PLENTY, IF WHAT
I THINK HAPPENED
HAS HAPPENED.

776
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,370
GUARD,
IS THAT DOOR SECURE?

777
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,914
YES, SIR.
NOTHING COULD GET IN.

778
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,707
GOOD. OPEN IT.

779
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,795
IT'S NOT WORKING, SIR.
IT SEEMS TO BE STUCK.

780
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,630
HERE. LET ME TRY IT.

781
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,389
THEY SEEM
TO BE GORGED.

782
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,434
GORGED? ON MY GRAIN?

783
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,604
KIRK, I AM GOING
TO HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE.

784
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,315
THERE MUST BE
THOUSANDS OF THEM.

785
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,816
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.

786
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,862
1,771,561.

787
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,613
THAT'S ASSUMING
ONE TRIBBLE,

788
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,366
MULTIPLYING
WITH AN AVERAGE
LITTER OF 10,

789
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,785
PRODUCING
A NEW GENERATION
EVERY 12 HOURS

790
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,871
OVER A PERIOD
OF THREE DAYS.

791
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,581
AND THAT'S
ASSUMING THAT THEY GOT
HERE THREE DAYS AGO.

792
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,376
AND ALLOWING FOR
THE AMOUNT OF
GRAIN CONSUMED

793
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,253
AND THE VOLUME
OF THE STORAGE
COMPARTMENT.

794
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,463
KIRK, YOU SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN.

795
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,966
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR TURNING

796
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,843
THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
INTO A TOTAL DISASTER.

797
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,053
MR. BARIS--

798
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:50,680
AND I'M THROUGH BEING
INTIMIDATED, KIRK.

799
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,350
NOW, YOU HAVE INSULTED ME,
YOU HAVE IGNORED ME,

800
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,101
YOU'VE WALKED
ALL OVER ME.

801
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,561
YOU HAVE ABUSED
YOUR AUTHORITY,

802
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:57,979
AND YOU HAVE REJECTED
MY REQUESTS.

803
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,564
AND THIS--
THIS IS THE RESULT.

804
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,025
I AM GOING TO HOLD
YOU RESPONSIBLE, KIRK.

805
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,820
MR. BARIS,
I'LL HOLD YOU IN IRONS
IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP.

806
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,947
JIM, I THINK
I'VE GOT IT.

807
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,533
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
QUIT FEEDING THEM.

808
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,245
IF WE QUIT
FEEDING THEM,
THEY STOP BREEDING.

809
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,914
NOW HE TELLS ME.

810
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,498
CAPTAIN...

811
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,292
THIS TRIBBLE
IS DEAD.

812
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:21,544
AND SO ARE THESE.

813
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,674
A LOT OF THEM ARE DEAD.

814
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,843
A LOT OF THEM
ARE ALIVE.

815
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,136
THEY WON'T BE FOR LONG.

816
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,430
THE LOGICAL ASSUMPTION
IS THAT THERE IS
SOMETHING IN THE GRAIN.

817
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,807
YES. BONES,
I WANT THE TRIBBLES,

818
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,434
THE GRAIN,
EVERYTHING ANALYZED.

819
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,853
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
KILLED THESE TRIBBLES.

820
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:43,400
I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT
WHAT KEEPS THEM ALIVE YET.

821
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,403
ALL RIGHT.
IF I FIND OUT ANYTHING,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

822
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,822
THAT ISN'T GOING TO DO
YOU ANY GOOD, KIRK.

823
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,532
THIS PROJECT IS RUINED,

824
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,743
AND STARFLEET IS GOING
TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

825
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,328
AND WHEN THEY DO,

826
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,330
THEY WILL HAVE
A BOARD OF INQUIRY.

827
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,082
AND THEY WILL
ROAST YOU ALIVE.

828
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,833
YES, WELL--
AND I AM GOING
TO BE THERE,

829
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,295
KIRK, TO ENJOY
EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

830
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,588
YES. UNTIL THAT
BOARD OF INQUIRY,
I'M STILL THE CAPTAIN.

831
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,673
AND AS CAPTAIN,
I WANT TWO THINGS DONE.

832
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,301
FIRST, FIND CYRANO JONES,

833
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:11,010
AND SECOND...

834
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,098
CLOSE THAT DOOR.

835
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,528
REALLY, CAPTAIN KIRK,

836
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,989
I MUST PROTEST
THIS TREATMENT.

837
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,949
AH, MR. JONES,
WITH AN ARMFUL.

838
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,826
A FEW QUESTIONS.

839
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:35,827
CAPTAIN KIRK!

840
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,454
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

841
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,871
AN OFFICIAL APOLOGY

842
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,915
ADDRESSED
TO THE KLINGON
HIGH COMMAND.

843
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,709
I EXPECT YOU TO ASSUME
FULL RESPONSIBILITY

844
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,921
FOR THE PERSECUTION
OF KLINGON NATIONALS
IN THIS QUADRANT.

845
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,631
AN APOLOGY?

846
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,675
YES. YOU'VE HARASSED
MY MEN.

847
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,593
YOU'VE TREATED THEM
LIKE CRIMINALS.

848
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,804
YOU'VE BEEN
MOST UNCOURTEOUS,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

849
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,515
NOW, IF YOU WISH TO
AVOID A DIPLOMATIC
INCIDENT--

850
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,558
NO, KIRK.
YOU CAN'T LET HIM.

851
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,269
THAT WILL GIVE THEM
THE WEDGE THEY NEED

852
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,146
TO CLAIM
SHERMAN'S PLANET.

853
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,523
I BELIEVE THAT MORE THAN
THE WORD OF AN AGGRIEVED
KLINGON COMMANDER

854
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,525
WOULD BE NECESSARY
FOR THAT, MR. BARIS.

855
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,027
MR. SPOCK,

856
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,737
AS FAR AS SHERMAN'S
PLANET IS CONCERNED,

857
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,657
CAPTAIN KIRK HAS ALREADY
GIVEN IT TO US.

858
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,451
WELL, WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT,

859
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,620
BUT BEFORE I TAKE
ANY OFFICIAL ACTION,

860
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,623
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
JUST WHAT HAPPENED.

861
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,250
WHO PUT THE TRIBBLES

862
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,793
IN THE QUADRO-TRITICALE?

863
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,171
AND WHAT WAS
IN THE GRAIN
THAT KILLED THEM?

864
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,130
CAPTAIN KIRK,

865
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,966
BEFORE YOU GO ON,
MAY I MAKE A REQUEST?

866
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:32,550
YES.

867
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:36,179
CAN YOU GET THOSE
THINGS OUT OF HERE?

871
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,443
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
TRIBBLES LIKED EVERYBODY.

872
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,445
WELL, THEY DO. I
CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

873
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,655
THE LAST TIME I SAW
ONE ACT THIS WAY

874
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,282
WAS AT THE BAR.

875
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,283
WHAT WAS IN THE BAR?

876
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,702

00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,676
WHY, YOU'RE
RIGHT,
MR. JONES.

879
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,928
THEY DON'T
LIKE KLINGONS.

00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,521

LIKE VULCANS.

00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,149
WELL, MR. SPOCK,
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

884
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,318
OBVIOUSLY TRIBBLES
ARE VERY PERCEPTIVE
CREATURES, CAPTAIN.

885
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,028
OBVIOUSLY.

890
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,837
THEY DON'T LIKE YOU,

00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,265

00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,479
JIM, THIS MAN
IS A KLINGON.

895
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,356
A KLINGON?

896
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,191
I WONDER WHAT
STARFLEET COMMAND

897
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,693
WILL SAY ABOUT THAT.

898
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,322
WHAT ABOUT
THE GRAIN, BONES?

899
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:19,865
OH, YES.
IT WAS POISONED.

900
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,659
POISONED?

901
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,036
YES. IT'S BEEN
IMPREGNATED
WITH A VIRUS.

902
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,080
THE VIRUS TURNS
INTO AN INERT

IN THE BLOODSTREAM.

00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,875
THE MORE
THE ORGANISM EATS,

THE MORE
INERT MATTER
IS BUILT UP.

906
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,588
SO AFTER
TWO OR 3 DAYS, IT
WOULD REACH A POINT

COULDN'T TAKE IN

NOTHING TO SAY.

AND THE TRIBBLES HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT?

I DON'T KNOW.
I NEVER SAW
ONE BEFORE

I NEVER SEE
