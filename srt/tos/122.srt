1
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,557
COMING UP
ON IT FAST, SIR.

2
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,730
ARE YOU CERTAIN
OF YOUR SENSOR READINGS?

3
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,816
DEFINITELY A SPACE
VESSEL OF SOME TYPE.

4
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,192
ORIGIN?

5
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,695
UNKNOWN. IT COULD HARDLY
BE AN EARTH SHIP.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,822
THERE HAVE BEEN NO FLIGHTS
INTO THIS SECTOR FOR YEARS.

7
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,574
I'M PICKING UP
A SIGNAL, SIR.

8
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,704
CAPTAIN, THAT'S THE OLD
MORSE CODE CALL SIGNAL.

9
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:37,705
THANK YOU.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,206
C-Q...C-Q...

11
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,708
WE'RE READING IT,
LIEUTENANT.

12
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,083
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

13
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,085
IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY
BE AN EARTH VESSEL.

14
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,087
I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND

15
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,047
WHY IT ALWAYS
GIVES YOU PLEASURE
TO SEE ME PROVEN WRONG.

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,677
AN EMOTIONAL EARTH
WEAKNESS OF MINE.

17
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,595
THERE IT IS.

18
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,726
AN OLD EARTH VESSEL,

19
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,853
SIMILAR TO
THE DY500 CLASS.

20
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,563
MUCH OLDER--

21
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,482
DY100 CLASS, TO BE EXACT.

22
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,071
CAPTAIN...

23
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,033
THE LAST SUCH VESSEL
WAS BUILT CENTURIES AGO,

24
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,993
BACK IN THE 1990s.

25
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,661
THEN IT'S A DERELICT,

26
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,621
ITS SIGNAL LEFT
ON AUTOMATIC.

27
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,708
OR AN OLD EARTH SHIP
BEING USED BY ALIENS.

28
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,626

VERY FAINT,
VERY SLOW.

59

00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,505
FROM ABOUT
60 OR 70 BODIES

61
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,506

MAKE OUT.

62
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,008
ALIEN BODIES?
COULD BE.

63
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,384
THERE'S NO SIGN
OF BREATHING

64

HOWEVER, SCANNERS
MAKE OUT A NAME--

THEN YOU CAN CHECK

NO SUCH VESSEL LISTED.

69
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,774
RECORDS OF THAT PERIOD
ARE FRAGMENTARY, HOWEVER.

70
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,903
THE MID-1990s WAS THE ERA
OF YOUR LAST SO-CALLED

YOU KNOW THE TYPE--

78
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,172

79
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,715

80
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,716

00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,718

CARE TO JOIN

86
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,810
WELL, IF YOU'RE
ACTUALLY GIVING
ME A CHOICE--

87
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,645
I'M NOT.

88
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,190
OH, I'LL NEED
SOMEBODY FAMILIAR

89
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,067
WITH THE LATE
20th CENTURY EARTH.

90
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,152

99
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,935
WELL, IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT SHIP
IS EXPECTING US.

100
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,270
WE READ
HEAT COMING ON,

101
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,938
COMPLETE
OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE.

102
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,815
VERY INTERESTING.
YOU READY, BONES?

103
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,690
NO.

104
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,985
I SIGNED ABOARD THIS SHIP
TO PRACTICE MEDICINE,

105
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,487
NOT TO HAVE MY ATOMS
SCATTERED BACK AND
FORTH ACROSS SPACE

106
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,197
BY THIS GADGET.

107
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,408
YOU'RE AN OLD-FASHIONED
BOY, McCOY.
WHERE'S THAT HISTORIAN?

108
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,577
COME ON,
LIEUTENANT, UH...

109
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,662
McGIVERS, SIR.

110
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,874
ENERGIZE.

111
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,485
SCOTTY?

112
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,988
DEFINITELY EARTH-TYPE
MECHANISMS, SIR.

113
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:07,993
20th CENTURY VESSEL--
OLD-TYPE ATOMIC POWER,

114
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,953
BULKY, SOLID...

115
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,081
I THINK THEY USED
TO CALL THEM
TRANSISTOR UNITS.

116
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,334
I'D LOVE TO TEAR
THIS BABY APART.

117
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,171
CAPTAIN,
IT'S A SLEEPER SHIP.

118
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,214
SUSPENDED ANIMATION.

119
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,757
UH-HUH. I'VE SEEN OLD
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THIS.

120
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,260
NECESSARY BECAUSE
OF THE TIME INVOLVED
IN SPACE TRAVEL

121
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,386
UNTIL ABOUT
THE YEAR 2018.

122
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,388
IT TOOK YEARS
JUST TO TRAVEL

123
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,683
FROM ONE PLANET
TO ANOTHER.

124
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,645
IS IT POSSIBLE
THEY'RE STILL ALIVE...

125
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,816
AFTER CENTURIES
OF TRAVEL?

126
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,693
IT'S THEORETICALLY
POSSIBLE.

127
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,196
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF IT BEING TESTED

128
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,114
FOR THIS LONG A PERIOD.

129
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,160
WHAT A HANDSOME
GROUP OF PEOPLE.

130
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,329
JIM, I HAVE
A NEW READING.

131
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,040
THE LIGHTS MUST
HAVE TRIGGERED
SOME MECHANISM.

132
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,875
CAPTAIN, LOOK HERE.

133
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,171
SCOTTY?

134
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,631
BEATS ME
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

135
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,426
WE'VE TRIGGERED SOMETHING,
ALL RIGHT.

136
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,929
THE HEARTBEAT'S
INCREASING--

137
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,014
NOW PASSING EIGHT BEATS
PER MINUTE--

138
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,808
AND THERE ARE SOME SIGNS
OF RESPIRATION BEGINNING.

139
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,227
THIS ONE WAS
PROBABLY PROGRAMMED

140
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,645
TO BE TRIGGERED
FIRST.

141
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,523
COULD HE BE
THE LEADER?

142
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,985
THE LEADER.

143
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,195
LIEUTENANT?

144
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,406
YES, SIR.

145
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,158
THE LEADER WAS OFTEN
SET TO REVIVE FIRST.

146
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,535
THIS WOULD
ALLOW HIM TO DECIDE

147
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,289
WHETHER THE CONDITIONS
WARRANTED REVIVAL
OF THE OTHERS.

148
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,916
HEARTBEAT NOW APPROACHING
40 PER MINUTE.

149
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,044
THE RESPIRATION PATTERN
IS FIRMING UP.

150
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,008
FROM THE NORTHERN
INDIA AREA, I'D GUESS.

151
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,385
PROBABLY A SIKH.

152
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,637
THEY WERE THE MOST
FANTASTIC WARRIORS.

153
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,431
HEARTBEAT NOW 52
AND INCREASING.

154
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,556
THE OTHERS?

155
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,600
NO CHANGE, AND THEY'RE
MIXED TYPES--

156
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,352
WESTERN, MID-EUROPEAN,

157
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,979
LATIN, ORIENTAL.

158
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,731
A MAN FROM
THE 20th CENTURY
COMING ALIVE.

159
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,566
MAYBE.

160
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,068
HEARTBEAT DROPPING.

161
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,154
CIRCUIT SHORTING.

162
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,780
PROBABLY
SOME DUST.

163
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,198
HEARTBEAT NOW 30,
DROPPING FAST.

164
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,117
THERE'S
A HEART FLUTTER.

165
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,160
HE'S DYING.

166
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,202
DO SOMETHING,
CAPTAIN.

167
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,162
CAN WE?

168
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,747
TAKE AN HOUR
TO FIGURE OUT.

169
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,207
WHAT HAPPENS IF
WE GET HIM OUT
OF THERE?

170
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,169
HE'LL DIE IN SECONDS
IF WE DON'T.

171
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:11,385
How...long?

172
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,972
HOW LONG...HAVE YOU
BEEN SLEEPING?

173
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,558
TWO CENTURIES

LOCK IN ON DR. McCOY'S BEAM.

179
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,485
HE'S TRANSPORTING BACK

180
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,944
WITH A CASUALTY
WE DISCOVERED HERE.

181
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,280
MAGNIFICENT.

<i>SCOTT HERE.</i>

195
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,532
SCOTTY, ANY RECORDS,

196
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,535
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.
IT APPEARS THEY WERE
IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION

197
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,578
WHEN THE SHIP TOOK OFF.

198
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,870
HOW MANY ALIVE?

199
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,289
<i>12 UNITS</i>
<i>HAVE MALFUNCTIONED,</i>

200

203
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,632
72 ALIVE...

204
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,177
A GROUP OF PEOPLE DATING
BACK TO THE 1990s.

205
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,763
A DISCOVERY OF SOME
IMPORTANCE, MR. SPOCK.

206
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,641
THERE ARE A GREAT MANY
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
ABOUT THOSE YEARS.

207
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,061
A STRANGE, VIOLENT PERIOD
IN YOUR HISTORY.

208
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:49,816
I FIND NO RECORD
WHATSOEVER OF AN
<i>S.S. BOTANY BAY.</i>

209
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,026
CAPTAIN,
THE DY100 CLASS VESSEL

210
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,155
WAS DESIGNED
FOR INTERPLANETARY
TRAVEL ONLY.

211
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,864
WITH SIMPLE
NUCLEAR-POWERED ENGINES,

212
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,368
STAR TRAVEL WAS CONSIDERED
IMPRACTICAL AT THAT TIME.

213
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:04,581
IT WAS 10,000-T0-1
AGAINST THEIR MAKING IT
TO ANOTHER STAR SYSTEM.

214
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,041
AND WHY
NO RECORD OF THE TRIP?

215
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,960
BOTANY BAY...

216
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,505
THAT WAS THE NAME
OF A PENAL COLONY

217
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,633
ON THE SHORES
OF AUSTRALIA,
WASN'T IT?

218
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,511
IF THEY TOOK
THAT NAME
FOR THEIR VESSEL...

219
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,428
IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING

220
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,139
THIS WAS A PENAL
DEPORTATION VESSEL,

221
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,517
YOU'VE ARRIVED AT A TOTALLY
ILLOGICAL CONCLUSION.

222
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,101
OH?

223
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,396
YOUR EARTH WAS ON THE VERGE
OF A DARK AGES.

224
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,982
WHOLE POPULATIONS WERE BEING
BOMBED OUT OF EXISTENCE.

225
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,985
A GROUP OF CRIMINALS
COULD HAVE BEEN DEALT
WITH FAR MORE EFFICIENTLY

226
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,613
THAN WASTING ONE OF THEIR
MOST ADVANCED SPACESHIPS.

227
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,115
YES.

228
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,284
SO MUCH FOR MY THEORY.

229
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,620
I'M STILL WAITING
TO HEAR YOURS.

230
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:50,709
EVEN A THEORY REQUIRES
SOME FACTS, CAPTAIN.

231
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,674
SO FAR...

232
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,258
I HAVE NONE.

233
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,303
AND THAT IRRITATES YOU,
MR. SPOCK.

234
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,805
IRRITATION?

235
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,973
YEAH.

236
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,809
I AM NOT CAPABLE
OF THAT EMOTION.

237
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,646
MY APOLOGIES, MR. SPOCK.

238
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,774
YOU SUSPECT SOME
DANGER IN THEM?

239
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,487
INSUFFICIENT FACTS ALWAYS
INVITE DANGER, CAPTAIN.

240
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,780
WELL, I'D BETTER
GET SOME FACTS.

241
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:20,907
RIG FOR TOWING.

242
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,367
AYE-AYE, SIR.

243
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,369
MAKE COURSE
FOR STARBASE 12.

244
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,828
AYE, SIR.

245
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,547
THAT WILL BE ALL.

246
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:46,725
BONES?

247
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,059
HE'LL LIVE.

248
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,519
MY COMPLIMENTS.

249
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,313
NO, I'M GOOD,
BUT NOT THAT GOOD.

250
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,357
THERE'S SOMETHING
INSIDE THIS MAN

251
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,192
THAT REFUSES
TO ACCEPT DEATH.

252
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,026
NOW, LOOK AT THAT--

253
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,070
EVEN AS HE IS NOW,

254
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,405
HIS
HEART VALVE ACTION

255
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,407
HAS TWICE THE POWER
OF YOURS AND MINE,

256
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,660
LUNG EFFICIENCY
50% BETTER.

257
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,454
AN IMPROVED BREED
OF HUMAN.

258
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,748
THAT'S WHAT
THE EUGENICS WAR
WAS ALL ABOUT.

259
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,585
I'D ESTIMATE HE
COULD LIFT US BOTH
WITH ONE ARM.

260
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,338
BE INTERESTING
TO SEE IF HIS BRAIN
MATCHES HIS BODY.

261
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,967
DOCTOR, WILL HE LIVE?

262
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,219
IT APPEARS HE WILL,
LIEUTENANT.

263
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,518
I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU.

264
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,355
IF I WERE TO RATE
YOUR PERFORMANCE

265
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,189
AS A MEMBER OF THE
LANDING PARTY TODAY--

266
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,692
I KNOW, SIR.
I'M SORRY.

267
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,360
LIEUTENANT,
AT ANY ONE TIME,

268
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,987
THE SAFETY
OF THIS ENTIRE VESSEL

269
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,864
MIGHT DEPEND ON
THE PERFORMANCE OF
A SINGLE CREWMAN ABOARD,

270
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,159
AND THE FACT
THAT YOU FIND A MAN

271
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,494
STRANGELY COMPELLING
TO YOU PERSONALLY--

272
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,287
NOT PERSONALLY, CAPTAIN.
PROFESSIONALLY.

273
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,581
MY PROFESSION IS HISTORIAN,

274
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,709
AND TO FIND A SPECIMEN
FROM THE PAST ALIVE--

275
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,588
I MEAN, THE SHEER DELIGHT
OF EXAMINING HIS MIND.

276
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,716
AND MEN WERE MORE
ADVENTURESOME THEN...

277
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,301
BOLDER, MORE COLORFUL?

278
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,053
YES, SIR,
I THINK THEY WERE.

279
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,806
GOOD.

280
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,390
IF I CAN HAVE HONESTY,

281
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,685
IT'S EASIER
TO OVERLOOK MISTAKES.

282
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,769
THAT'S ALL.

283
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,645
YES, SIR.

284
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,527
A PITY YOU WASTED YOUR
LIFE ON COMMAND, JIM.

285
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,321
YOU'D HAVE MADE
A FAIR PSYCHOLOGIST.

286
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,947
FAIR?

287
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,113
SICK BAY TO LAB.

288
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,115
ANYTHING NEW
ON THOSE BIOS?

289
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,951
<i>THEY ALL CAME OUT FINE,</i>
<i>DOCTOR.</i>

290
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,912
GOOD. McCOY OUT.

291
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,407
WELL, EITHER CHOKE ME
OR CUT MY THROAT.

292
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,575
MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

293
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,161
ENGLISH.

294
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,373
I THOUGHT I DREAMED
HEARING IT.

295
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,833
WHERE AM I?

296
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,502
YOU'RE--

297
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,550
YOU'RE IN BED,

298
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,095
HOLDING A KNIFE
AT YOUR DOCTOR'S THROAT.

299
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,265
ANSWER MY QUESTION.

300
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,475
IT WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE

301
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,436
IF YOU WOULD CUT
THE CAROTID ARTERY

302
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,605
JUST UNDER THE LEFT EAR.

303
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,908
I LIKE A BRAVE MAN.

304
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,998
I WAS SIMPLY TRYING
TO AVOID AN ARGUMENT.

305
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,001
YOU'RE ABOARD THE UNITED
SPACESHIP<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

306
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,962
YOUR VESSEL IS IN TOW.

307
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,547
I REMEMBER
A VOICE...

308
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:51,970
DID I HEAR IT SAY
I HAD BEEN SLEEPING
FOR TWO CENTURIES?

309
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,639
THAT IS CORRECT.

310
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,559
WHERE IS YOUR CAPTAIN?

311
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,812
I HAVE MANY QUESTIONS.

312
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,362
<i>BRIDGE.</i>

313
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,865
I HAVE A PATIENT HERE WITH
MANY QUESTIONS, CAPTAIN.

314
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,658
<i>ON MY WAY.</i>

315
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,382
JAMES KIRK, COMMANDING
THE STARSHIP<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

316
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,550
I SEE.

317
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,094
AND YOUR NAME?

318
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,016
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS
FIRST.

319
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,142
WHAT IS YOUR HEADING?

320
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,187
OUR HEADING
IS STARBASE 12,

321
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,148
A PLANET IN THE GAMMA 400
STAR SYSTEM--

322
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,609
OUR COMMAND BASE
IN THIS SECTOR.

323
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,404
IS THAT OF ANY USE TO YOU?

324
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,075
AND, UM...

325
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,201
MY PEOPLE?

326
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,538
72 OF YOUR
LIFE-SUPPORT CANISTERS

327
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,623
ARE STILL FUNCTIONING.

328
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,423
YOU WILL REVIVE THEM.

329
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,843
AS SOON AS WE REACH
STARBASE 12.

330
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,554
I SEE.

331
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,682
AND NOW...

332
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,687
KHAN IS MY NAME.

333
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,232
KHAN--NOTHING ELSE?

334
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,650
KHAN.

335
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,987
WHAT WAS THE EXACT DATE
OF YOUR LIFT-OFF?

336
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,572
WE KNOW IT WAS SOMETIME
IN THE EARLY 1990s.

337
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:39,159
I FIND MYSELF GROWING
FATIGUED, DOCTOR.

338
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,080
MAY WE CONTINUE THIS...
QUESTIONING

339
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,873
AT SOME OTHER TIME?

340
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,667
THE FACTS I NEED, MR. KHAN,
WILL TAKE VERY LITTLE TIME.

341
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,336
FOR EXAMPLE, THE NATURE
OF YOUR EXPEDITION--

342
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,713
JIM...

343
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,048
A LITTLE LATER
MIGHT BE BETTER.

344
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,053
CAPTAIN,

345
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,640
I WONDER IF I COULD
HAVE SOMETHING TO READ
DURING MY CONVALESCENCE.

346
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,183
I WAS ONCE
AN ENGINEER OF SORTS.

347
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,478
I WOULD BE MOST
INTERESTED IN STUDYING

348
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,731
THE TECHNICAL MANUALS
ON YOUR VESSEL.

349
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,149
YES, I UNDERSTAND.

350
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,111
YOU HAVE 200 YEARS
OF CATCHING UP TO DO.

351
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,737
PRECISELY.

352
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:21,160
THEY'RE AVAILABLE
TO ANY PATIENT ON
THE VIEWING SCREEN.

353
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:25,790
DR. McCOY WILL SHOW YOU
HOW TO TIE INTO
THE LIBRARY TAPES.

354
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,583
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

355
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,168
YOU ARE
VERY COOPERATIVE.

356
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,271
THIS KHAN IS NOT
WHAT I EXPECTED

357
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,107
OF A 20th CENTURY
MAN.

358
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,943
I NOTE HE'S MAKING
CONSIDERABLE USE OF
OUR TECHNICAL LIBRARY.

359
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,361
COMMON COURTESY,
MR. SPOCK.

360
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,197
OF HE'S GONNA SPEND
THE REST OF HIS DAYS
IN OUR TIME,

361
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,283
IT'S ONLY DECENT TO
HELP HIM CATCH UP.

362
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:06,288
WOULD YOU ESTIMATE
HIM TO BE A PRODUCT

363
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,665
OF
SELECTIVE BREEDING?

364
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,750
THERE IS THAT POSSIBILITY,
CAPTAIN.

365
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,588
HIS AGE WOULD BE CORRECT.

366
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,176
IN 1993, A GROUP
OF THESE YOUNG SUPERMEN

367
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,804
DID SEIZE POWER
SIMULTANEOUSLY
IN OVER 40 NATIONS.

368
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,182
WELL, THEY WERE
HARDLY SUPERMEN.

369
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,808
THEY WERE AGGRESSIVE,
ARROGANT.

370
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,643
THEY BEGAN TO BATTLE
AMONG THEMSELVES.

371
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:32,148
BECAUSE THE SCIENTISTS
OVERLOOKED ONE FACT--

372
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:36,152
SUPERIOR ABILITY
BREEDS SUPERIOR AMBITION.

373
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,988
INTERESTING, IF TRUE.

374
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,742
THEY CREATED A GROUP OF
ALEXANDERS, NAPOLEONS.

375
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:46,120
I HAVE COLLECTED
SOME NAMES

376
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,748
AND MADE SOME COUNTS.

377
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,751
BY MY ESTIMATE,
THERE WERE SOME 80 OR 90

378
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,503
OF THESE YOUNG SUPERMEN
UNACCOUNTED FOR

379
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,672
WHEN THEY WERE
FINALLY DEFEATED.

380
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:03,596
THAT FACT ISN'T
IN THE HISTORY TEXTS.

381
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,682
WOULD YOU REVEAL
TO WAR-WEARY POPULATIONS

382
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,561
THAT SOME 80 NAPOLEONS
MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE?

383
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,028
SHIP'S HISTORIAN,
LIEUTENANT--

384
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,363
MARLA McGIVERS.

385
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,531
YES.

386
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,868
I AM TOLD
YOU PARTICIPATED
IN MY REBIRTH.

387
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,412
IN A SMALL WAY.

388
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,373
I'VE BEEN READING UP
ON STARSHIPS,

389
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,375
BUT THEY HAVE
ONE LUXURY

390
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,419
NOT MENTIONED
IN THE MANUALS.

391
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,671
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

392
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,092
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

393
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,345
MY NAME IS KHAN.

394
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,640
PLEASE SIT
AND ENTERTAIN ME.

395
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,563
I'D LIKE SOME
HISTORICAL INFORMATION
ABOUT YOUR SHIP,

396
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,149
ITS PURPOSE AND--

397
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,358
AND WHY DO YOU
WEAR YOUR HAIR

398
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,694
IN SUCH AN
UNCOMPLIMENTARY FASHION?

399
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,489
IT'S COMFORTABLE.

400
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,574
BUT IT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE.

401
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:27,638
THERE...

402
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,850
SOFT...

403
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,560
NATURAL...

404
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,314
SIMPLE.

405
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,233
MR. KHAN, I'M HERE
ON BUSINESS.

406
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,944
YOU FIND
NO PLEASURE HERE?

407
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,780
MY INTEREST IS
SCIENTIFIC. MEN OF--

408
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,033
THAT IS, THE WORLD
OF THE PAST--

409
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,160
I'M SURE
YOU UNDERSTAND
TO ACTUALLY TALK

410
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,786
TO A MAN
OF YOUR CENTURY--

411
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,662
THERE...

412
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,541
SIMPLE...

413
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,627
SOFT...

414
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,088
PLEASE REMEMBER.

415
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,801
PERHAPS SOME OTHER TIME,

416
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,554
WHEN YOU FEEL MORE LIKE
TALKING ABOUT THE PAST.

417
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,893
I'M GLAD YOU CAME.

418
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,356
PLEASE DO IT AGAIN.

419
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,744
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

420
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,454
ARE WE EXPECTING
A FLEET ADMIRAL
FOR DINNER?

421
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,168
LIEUTENANT McGIVERS' IDEA
TO WELCOME KHAN
TO OUR CENTURY.

422
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:44,422
JUST HOW STRONGLY
IS SHE ATTRACTED TO HIM?

423
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,676
WELL, THERE AREN'T
ANY REGULATIONS
AGAINST ROMANCE, JIM.

424
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,764
MY CURIOSITY IS OFFICIAL,
NOT PERSONAL, BONES.

425
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,975
WELL,
HE HAS A MAGNETISM,

426
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,603
ALMOST ELECTRIC--
YOU FELT IT--

427
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,563
AND IT COULD
OVERPOWER McGIVERS

428
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,815
WITH HER
PREOCCUPATION
WITH THE PAST.

429
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,609
THANK YOU.

430
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,656
I HOPED, UH,
YOU MIGHT GUIDE ME

431
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,700
TO OUR
DINNER ENGAGEMENT.

432
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,621
VERY GOOD.

433
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,040
FINE TECHNIQUE.

434
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,709
IT'S A GLADIATOR
NAMED FLAVIUS.
HE ONCE---

435
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,545
AND YOU'VE
REARRANGED
YOUR HAIR FOR ME.

436
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,382
EXCELLENT.

437
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,515
ALL BOLD MEN
FROM THE PAST.

438
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,894
RICHARD,
LEIF ERICSON,
NAPOLEON.

439
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,231
A HOBBY OF YOURS,
SUCH MEN?

440
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,995
I AM HONORED.

441
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,581
THANK YOU.

442
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,209
BUT I CAUTION YOU.

443
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:06,422
SUCH MEN DARE TAKE
WHAT THEY WANT.

444
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,026
FORGIVE MY CURIOSITY,
MR. KHAN,

445
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,735
BUT MY OFFICERS
ARE ANXIOUS

446
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,113
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR
EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY.

447
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,032
AND HOW YOU MANAGED

448
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,659
TO KEEP IT OUT OF
THE HISTORY BOOKS.

449
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,036
ADVENTURE, CAPTAIN.
ADVENTURE.

450
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,997
THERE WAS LITTLE ELSE
LEFT ON EARTH.

451
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,999
THERE WAS THE WAR
TO END TYRANNY.

452
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,418
MANY CONSIDERED THAT
A NOBLE EFFORT.

453
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,170
TYRANNY, SIR?

454
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,588
OR AN ATTEMPT
TO UNIFY HUMANITY?

455
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,466
UNIFY, SIR?

456
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,551
LIKE A TEAM OF ANIMALS
UNDER ONE WHIP?

457
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:02,228
I KNOW SOMETHING
OF THOSE YEARS, REMEMBER.

458
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,356
IT WAS A TIME
OF GREAT DREAMS,

459
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,401
OF GREAT ASPIRATION.

460
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,153
UNDER DOZENS
OF PETTY DICTATORSHIPS.

461
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,157
ONE MAN WOULD
HAVE RULED EVENTUALLY,

462
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,201
AS ROME
UNDER CAESAR.

463
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,661
THINK OF
ITS ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

464
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,625
THEN YOUR SYMPATHIES
WERE WITH--

465
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,586
YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT
TACTICIAN, CAPTAIN.

466
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,589
YOU LET YOUR
SECOND-IN-COMMAND ATTACK

467
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,927
WHILE YOU SIT AND WATCH
FOR WEAKNESS.

468
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:38,847
YOU HAVE A TENDENCY
TO EXPRESS IDEAS
IN MILITARY TERMS,

469
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,558
MR. KHAN.

470
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,772
THIS IS
A SOCIAL OCCASION.

471
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,235
IT HAS BEEN SAID

472
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,448
THAT SOCIAL OCCASIONS
ARE ONLY WARFARE CONCEALED.

473
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,536
MANY PREFER IT
MORE HONEST,

474
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,620
MORE OPEN.

475
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,164
YOU FLED. WHY,
WERE YOU AFRAID?

476
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,666
I'VE NEVER BEEN AFRAID.

477
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,503
BUT YOU LEFT AT THE
VERY TIME MANKIND
NEEDED COURAGE.

478
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,672
WE OFFERED
THE WORLD ORDER!

479
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,550
WE?

480
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,224
EXCELLENT.

481
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,559
EXCELLENT.

482
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,860
BUT IF YOU
WILL EXCUSE ME,
GENTLEMEN AND LADIES,

483
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,530
I GROW FATIGUED AGAIN.

484
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,906
WITH YOUR
PERMISSION, CAPTAIN,

485
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,784
I WILL RETURN
TO MY QUARTERS.

486
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,423
[DOOR BUZZES]

487
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,852
I WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE.

488
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,855
THEY HAD NO RIGHT
TO TREAT YOU
THAT WAY.

489
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,565
QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE,

490
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:15,152
SINCE I'M SOMETHING
OF A MYSTERY TO THEM.

491
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,029
YOU'RE
NO MYSTERY TO ME.

492
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,281
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHO YOU ARE.

493
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,952
DO YOU?

494
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:24,953
MM-HMM.

495
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,164
LEIF ERICSON,

496
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,083
RICHARD
THE LION-HEARTED,
NAPOLEON.

497
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:33,629
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE
LIVING IN OUR TIME.

498
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,090
THEN I'LL HAVE
TO REMOLD IT
TO MY LIKING.

499
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,467
PLEASE DON'T.

500
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,677
GO.

501
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,678
OR STAY.

502
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:45,307
BUT DO IT
BECAUSE IT IS
WHAT YOU WISH TO DO.

503
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,066
WELL?

504
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,444
I'LL STAY
A LITTLE LONGER.

505
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:01,823
HOW MANY MINUTES
DO YOU GRACIOUSLY OFFER?

506
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,450
I ONLY MEANT--

507
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,077
THIS GROWS TIRESOME.

508
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:08,372
YOU MUST NOW
ASK TO STAY.

509
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,291
I'D LIKE TO STAY.

510
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,504
PLEASE.

511
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:37,025
OPEN YOUR HEART.

512
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,072
WILL YOU OPEN
YOUR HEART?

513
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,657
YES.

514
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,079
I INTEND TO TAKE
THIS SHIP.

515
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,581
DO YOU AGREE?

516
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,124
OH, PLEASE
DON'T ASK ME--

517
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,127
I NEED YOUR HELP.

518
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,464
YOU WON'T
HARM ANYONE?

519
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,090
NOW YOU
QUESTION ME?

520
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,049
NO.

521
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,593
WILL YOU
ASSIST ME?

522
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,095
OH, PLEASE, KHAN,
DON'T ASK ME--

526
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,360
I PROMISE.

527
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,657
I'LL DO ANYTHING
YOU ASK.

528
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,005
NAME--

529
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,214
KHAN.

530
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,425
AS WE
KNOW HIM TODAY.

531
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,138
NAME--

532
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,307
KHAN NOONIEN SINGH.

533
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,891
FROM 1992 THROUGH 1996,

534
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,270
ABSOLUTE RULER OF MORE THAN
A QUARTER OF YOUR WORLD,

535
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,647
FROM ASIA THROUGH
THE MIDDLE EAST.

536
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,358
THE LAST OF THE TYRANTS
TO BE OVERTHROWN.

537
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,276
I MUST CONFESS,
GENTLEMEN.

538
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,779
I'VE ALWAYS HELD A
SNEAKING ADMIRATION

539
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,197
FOR THIS ONE.

540
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,241
HE WAS THE BEST
OF THE TYRANTS

541
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,827
AND THE MOST DANGEROUS.

542
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,037
THEY WERE SUPERMEN
IN A SENSE.

543
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,121
STRONGER, BRAVER,

544
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,624
CERTAINLY MORE
AMBITIOUS, MORE DARING.

545
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,000
GENTLEMEN,
THIS ROMANTICISM

546
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,211
ABOUT A RUTHLESS
DICTATOR IS--

547
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:23,632
MR. SPOCK, WE HUMANS
HAVE A STREAK
OF BARBARISM IN US.

548
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,092
APPALLING, BUT THERE,
NEVERTHELESS.

549
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,011
THERE WERE
NO MASSACRES
UNDER HIS RULE.

550
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,638
AND AS
LITTLE FREEDOM.

551
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,057
NO WARS UNTIL
HE WAS ATTACKED.

552
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,559
GENTLEMEN.

553
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,480
MR. SPOCK,
YOU MISUNDERSTAND US.

554
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,817
WE CAN BE AGAINST HIM
AND ADMIRE HIM

555
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,027
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

556
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,029
ILLOGICAL.

557
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,239
TOTALLY.

558
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:49,949

559
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:53,453
PUT A 24-HOUR SECURITY
ON MR. KHAN'S QUARTERS,

560
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,580
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

561
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,635
AHH.

562
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:09,845
I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN.

563
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,012
I WAS, UM,

564
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,306
LOST IN THOUGHT.

565

LOCKED FROM OUTSIDE,
A GUARD POSTED.

567
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,444
UNUSUAL TREATMENT
FOR KHAN
NOONIEN SINGH.

568
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:27,905
EXCELLENT.

569
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:33,118
YOU IDENTIFIED ME
WITH YOUR COMPUTER
SYSTEM, I IMAGINE.

570
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,370
I'D LIKE
THOSE ANSWERS NOW.

571
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,791

I DOUBT YOU
WOULD UNDERSTAND.

576
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:52,763
WHY?

577
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,683
BECAUSE I'M
NOT A PRODUCT OF
CONTROLLED GENETICS?

578
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:00,437
CAPTAIN, ALTHOUGH
YOUR ABILITIES
INTRIGUE ME,

579
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,483
YOU ARE QUITE
HONESTLY INFERIOR.

580

581
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,111

582
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,531

THERE HAS BEEN
IN HUMAN EVOLUTION.

583
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,951
OH, THERE HAS BEEN
TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENT,

584
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,410
BUT, UH,

585
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:19,581
HOW LITTLE MAN HIMSELF
HAS CHANGED.

586
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,253
YES, IT APPEARS

587

I SAVED YOUR LIFE.

703
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,307
NOW PLEASE
DON'T KILL HIM.

704
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,740
SURPRISED TO SEE YOU,
CAPTAIN, THOUGH PLEASED.

705
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,783
I'M A LITTLE
PLEASED MYSELF.

706
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:58,701
SITUATION?

707
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:02,038
KHAN IS
HOLDING OUR STAFF
IN THE BRIEFING ROOM.

708
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,249
HIS MEN HAVE CONTROL
OF THE SHIP.

709
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,584
OUR ONLY CHANCE
IS THE INTRUDER
CONTROL CIRCUIT,

710
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,545
ALTHOUGH
HE'S CUT IT OFF
AT THE BRIDGE.

711
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,047
THERE'S
A RELAY JUNCTION
DOWN THE CORRIDOR.

712
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,299
GAS ALL DECKS
BUT THIS ONE.

713
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:16,594
ARMORY,
THIS IS KHAN.

714
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,595
REPORT.

715
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,267
RODRIGUEZ.

716
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,102
LING.

717
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,978
McPHERSON.

718
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,981
ANYONE, REPORT STATUS.

719
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,834
WHERE'S KHAN?

720
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,463
I DON'T KNOW. HE GOT OUT
JUST AS THE GAS--

721
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,465
[BEEP]

722
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,049
KIRK HERE.

723
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,469
<i>ANESTHESIA GAS</i>
<i>IN ALL SECTIONS</i>
<i>EXCEPT ENGINEERING.</i>

724
00:43:57,594 --> 00:44:00,472
<i>SOMEONE JUST CLOSED</i>
<i>THAT LINE.</i>

725
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,393
<i>CAPTAIN, ACKNOWLEDGE.</i>

726
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,019
<i>UNABLE TO FLOOD</i>
<i>ENGINEERING SECTION.</i>
<i>I SUSPECT...</i>

727
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,938
<i>THIS IS SCOTT.</i>

728
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,856
<i>CAPTAIN'S HEADED</i>
<i>FOR THE ENGINEERING</i>
<i>SECTION.</i>

729
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,609
<i>I'LL FOLLOW</i>
<i>IN CASE--</i>

730
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,944
<i>NEGATIVE. WE MUST</i>
<i>RETAKE THE VESSEL</i>

731
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,571
<i>WHILE</i>
<i>THE ANESTHESIA LASTS.</i>

732
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,406
<i>MEET ME</i>
<i>IN THE ARMORY.</i>

733
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,908
<i>I'M BLOWING IT</i>
<i>CLEAR FIRST.</i>
<i>SPOCK OUT.</i>

734
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,009
[BEEP BEEP]

735
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,557
IF I UNDERSTOOD
YOUR MANUALS,

736
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,685
THAT'S AN OVERLOAD
IN PROGRESS.

737
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,314
YOUR SHIP FLARES UP
LIKE AN EXPLODING SUN

738
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,524
WITHIN MINUTES.

739
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:37,985
I HAVE FIVE TIMES
YOUR STRENGTH.

740
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,488
YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR ME.

741
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:11,977
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STAR DATE 3143.3.</i>

742
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,980
<i>CONTROL OF THE</i> ENTERPRISE
<i>HAS BEEN REGAINED.</i>

743
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:18,443
<i>I WISH MY NEXT DECISIONS</i>
<i>WERE NO MORE DIFFICULT.</i>

744
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,445
<i>KHAN AND HIS PEOPLE--</i>

745
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,654
<i>WHAT A WASTE</i>

746
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:24,990
<i>TO PUT THEM IN</i>
<i>A REORIENTATION CENTER.</i>

747
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,369
<i>AND WHAT DO I DO</i>
<i>ABOUT McGIVERS?</i>

748
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:32,415
RECORD TAPES ENGAGED
AND READY, CAPTAIN.

749
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,875
[DING DING]

750
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,301
THIS HEARING
IS NOW IN SESSION.

751
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,722
UNDER THE AUTHORITY
VESTED IN ME

752
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,557
BY STARFLEET
COMMAND...

753
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:55,229
I DECLARE ALL CHARGES
AND SPECIFICATIONS
IN THIS MATTER

754
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,564
HAVE BEEN DROPPED.

755
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,527
JIM. AGREED YOU HAVE
THE AUTHORITY--

756
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:02,570
MR. SPOCK, I BELIEVE
OUR HEADING

757
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:05,906
TAKES US NEAR THE CETI
ALPHA STAR SYSTEM.

758
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,492
QUITE CORRECT,
CAPTAIN.

759
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:09,910
PLANET NUMBER
FIVE THERE
IS HABITABLE,

760
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,537
ALTHOUGH
A BIT SAVAGE,

761
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:12,913
SOMEWHAT
INHOSPITABLE.

762
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,167
BUT NO MORE THAN AUSTRALIA'S
BOTANY BAY COLONY WAS

763
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,752
AT THE BEGINNING.

764
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:21,922
THOSE MEN WENT ON TO TAME
A CONTINENT, MR. KHAN.

765
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,508
CAN YOU TAME A WORLD?

766
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:26,636
HAVE YOU EVER
READ MILTON, CAPTAIN?

767
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,846
YES.

768
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,518
I UNDERSTAND.

769
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,772
LIEUTENANT
MARLA McGIVERS.

770
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,778
GIVEN A CHOICE

771
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:48,157
OF COURT-MARTIAL
OR ACCOMPANYING
THEM THERE...

772
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,537
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT.

773
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:54,163
A STRUGGLE AT FIRST,

774
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,416
EVEN TO STAY ALIVE,
TO FIND FOOD.

775
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,630
I'LL GO
WITH HIM, SIR.

776
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,677
A SUPERIOR WOMAN.

777
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,055
I WILL TAKE HER.

778
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,059
AND I'VE GOTTEN
SOMETHING ELSE
I WANTED--

779
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,228
A WORLD TO WIN,

780
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:20,606
AN EMPIRE TO BUILD.

781
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:27,613
THIS HEARING
IS CLOSED.

782
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:40,626
IT'S A SHAME
FOR A GOOD SCOTSMAN
TO ADMIT IT,

783
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:43,755
BUT I'M NOT UP
ON MILTON.

784
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,381
THE STATEMENT
LUCIFER MADE

785
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,383
WHEN HE FELL
INTO THE PIT.

786
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,761
"IT IS BETTER
TO RULE IN HELL

787
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:51,303
THAN SERVE
IN HEAVEN."

788
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,222
HUH.

789
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,224
IT WOULD BE
INTERESTING, CAPTAIN,

790
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,561
TO RETURN TO THAT WORLD
IN A HUNDRED YEARS

791
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,145
AND TO LEARN

792
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,607
WHAT CROP HAS SPRUNG
FROM THE SEED

793
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:04,442
YOU PLANTED TODAY.

794
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,986
YES, MR. SPOCK,

795
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,739
IT WOULD INDEED.
