1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,215
Personal log,
stardate 3013. 1.

2
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:11,094
I find it hard to believe
the events of the past 24 hours

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,682
or the plea of Mr. Spock
standing general court-martial.

4
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:18,602
How do you plead to the charge
of unlawfully taking command
of this starship?

5
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,061
Guilty.

6
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,189
Of sabotaging the computers
of this vessel

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,816
and locking it
on a course

8
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,567
for planet Talos IV?

9
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,527
Guilty.

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,945
And of forcibly
attempting

11
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,948
to transport Captain Pike
to that planet?

12
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:31,907
Guilty.

13
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,075
Why? Why does Spock

14
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,662
want to take to that forbidden
world his former captain,

15
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,373
mutilated by
a recent space disaster,

16
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:43,168
now a shell of a man,
unable to speak or move?

17
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,337
The only answer
Spock would give

18
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,339
was on
the hearing-room screen.

19
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,967
How Spock would do this,
he refused to explain,

20
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,844
but there, before our eyes,

21
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:55,263
actual images
from 13 years ago

22
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,307
of Captain Pike as he was

23
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,100
when he commanded
this vessel,

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,102
of Spock in those days,

25
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,022
and of how the Enterprise

26
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:05,941
had become the first
and only starship

27
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:09,194
to visit Talos IV.

28
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,948
They had received
a distress signal
from that planet

29
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,366
and discovered there,

30
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,284
still alive
after many years,

31
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,453
the survivors
of a missing vessel,

32
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,750
only to find
it was all an illusion--

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,335
No survivors...

34
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,337
no encampment...

35
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,589
it was all a trap

36
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,007
set by a race of beings

37
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,842
who could make a man
believe he was seeing

38
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,219
anything they wished
him to see,

39
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,138
and Captain Pike was gone,

40
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,267
a prisoner for some
unknown purpose.

41
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,185
The images we've
been seeing are--

42
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,021
Are coming
from Talos IV.

43
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,231
You're aware of the orders

44
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,943
regarding any contact
with Talos IV.

45
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,570
You have deliberately invited
the death penalty.

46
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,077
Do you know
what you're doing?

47
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,578
Have you
lost your mind?

48
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:00,621
Captain.

49
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,956
Jim, please.

50
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,791
Don't stop me.

51
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,417
Don't let him stop me.

52
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,963
It's your career
and Captain Pike's life.

53
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,840
You must see the rest
of the transmission.

54
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:27,022
Space--
the final frontier.

55
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,859
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

56
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,319
Its five-year mission--

57
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,572
to explore
strange new worlds,

58
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,159
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

59
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,622
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

60
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,491
The court-martial
of Mr. Spock

61
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,119
has been convened
in closed session.

62
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,745
Despite all we can do,

63
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,665
images continue to be
transmitted to us

64
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,207
from Talos IV.

65
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,670
Starfleet has ordered no
contact with Talos IV.

66
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,254
They made no exceptions.

67
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,423
You have no choice, sir.

68
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,844
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,638
The keeper has taken
control of our screen.

70
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,641
Do you understand, sir?

71
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,019
As you saw before,

72
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,479
Captain Pike had been
knocked unconscious

73
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,982
and captured by
the Talosians.

74
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,535
Can you hear me?

75
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,455
My name is Christopher Pike,

76
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,874
commander of the space
vehicle Enterprise

77
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,920
from the stellar group
at the other end
of this galaxy.

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,880
Our intentions
are peaceful.

79
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,673
Can you understand me?

80
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,467
It appears, Magistrate,

81
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,844
that the intelligence
of the specimen

82
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,721
is shockingly limited.

83
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,849
This is no surprise,
since his vessel
was baited here so easily

84
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,559
with a simulated
message.

85
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,478
As you can read
in its thoughts,

86
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,105
it is only now
beginning to suspect

87
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,773
that the survivors
and encampment

88
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,234
were a simple illusion
we placed in their minds.

89
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,111
You're not speaking,
yet I can hear you.

90
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,779
Note the confusion

91
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,363
as it reads our
thought transmissions.

92
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,658
All right, then,
telepathy.

93
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,286
You can read my mind.
I can read yours.

94
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,163
Now, unless you
want my ship

95
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,165
to consider capturing me
an unfriendly act--

96
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,750
You now see the primitive
fear/threat reaction.

97
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,588
The specimen is about to boast
of his strength,

98
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,174
the weaponry
of his vessel,

99
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,383
and so on.

100
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,219
Next...

101
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,595
frustrated into a need

102
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,346
to display
physical prowess,

103
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,765
the creature
will throw himself

104
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,684
against
the transparency.

105
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,275
If you were in here,

106
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,443
wouldn't you test the strength
of these walls, too?

107
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,070
There's a way out
of any cage,

108
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,947
and I'll find it.

109
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,199
Despite its frustration,

110
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,700
the creature
appears more adaptable

111
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,119
than our specimens
from other planets.

112
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,621
We can soon begin
the experiment.

113
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,294
The inhabitants
of this planet

114
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,920
must live deep underground,

115
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,007
probably manufacture food
and other needs down there.

116
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,219
Our tests indicate
the planet surface,

117
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,888
without considerably more
vegetation or some animals,

118
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,639
is simply too barren
to support life.

119
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,933
So we just thought
we saw survivors there.

120
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,227
Exactly.

121
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,354
An illusion placed
in our minds

122
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,730
by this planet's
inhabitants.

123
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,690
It was
a perfect illusion.

124
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,735
They had us seeing just
what we wanted to see--

125
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,444
human beings
who had survived

126
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,988
with dignity and bravery,

127
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,907
everything
entirely logical,

128
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,449
right down to the building
of the camp,

129
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,703
the tattered clothing,
everything.

130
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:55,332
Let's be sure we understand
the danger of this.

131
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,791
The inhabitants
of this planet

132
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,417
can read our minds,

133
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,296
can create illusions out
of a person's own thoughts,

134
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,756
memories, and experiences,

135
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,217
even out of a person's
own desires,

136
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,302
illusions
just as real and solid

137
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,469
as this table top

138
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,971
and just as impossible
to ignore.

139
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,266
It's Captain Pike
they've got.

140
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,267
He needs help.

141
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,269
If we buzz about
down there,

142
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,562
we may find their mental
power is so great,

143
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,815
they could swat
this ship like a fly.

144
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,943
That entry resisted
hand lasers.

145
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,153
We'll transmit
the ship's power against it,

146
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,988
enough to blast
half a continent.

147
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,577
Engineering deck will rig
to transmit ship's power.

148
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,414
We'll try blasting
through that metal.

149
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,255
Thousands of us

150
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,758
are already probing
the creature's thoughts,
Magistrate.

151
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,137
We find excellent
memory capacity.

152
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,432
I read most strongly
a recent death struggle

153
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,184
in which it fought
to protect its life.

154
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,561
We will begin with this,

155
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,816
giving the specimen
something more interesting
to protect.

156
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,377
Come on.

157
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,046
We must
hide ourselves.

158
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,589
Come.

159
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,050
Come.

160
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,886
Hurry.
It's deserted.

161
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,473
There'll be weapons
and perhaps food.

162
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,599
This is Rigel 7.

163
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,894
Please, we must
hide ourselves.

164
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:44,441
I was in a cage, a cell,
in some kind of a zoo.

165
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,193
I must still be there.

166
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,568
Come on.

167
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,029
They've reached
into my mind

168
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,989
and taken the memory
of somewhere I've been.

169
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,532
[ Grrr ]

170
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,742
The Kaylar!

171
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,205
It's starting
just as it happened
two weeks ago.

172
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,415
[ Grrr ]

173
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,417
Except for you.

174
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,637
A brilliant deduction
by Captain Pike, gentlemen.

175
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,098
Yes, he was still
inside his cell,

176
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,850
but knowing that
couldn't help him.

177
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,810
The Talosians
controlled his brain.

178
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,604
And could make him live
any place, any time,

179
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,482
any situation
they wished.

180
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:29,403
He would see,
taste, suffer

181
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,821
with the same reality
as you gentlemen sitting there.

182
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,823
Longer hair,

now only one hour
ahead of us,

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,892
the story of Captain Pike's
imprisonment there.

No, that's not
any answer.

I've never met you before,
never even imagined you.

249
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:53,625
Perhaps they made me
out of dreams
you've forgotten.

250
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,503
And dress you in the same
metal fabric they wear?

251
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,005
I can wear
whatever you wish

252

or be anything you wish.

253
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,885
So they can see how
their specimen performs?

254
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,845
They want to
see how I react?

255
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,266
Don't you
have a--a dream,

256
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,811
something you've always
wanted very badly?

257
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,813
Or do they do more
than just watch me?

258
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,939
Do they...

259
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,608

you can please me.

You can tell me
about them.

269
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,760
How can I keep them
from probing my mind,

270
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,971
from using my thoughts
against me?

271
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,142
Does that frighten you?

272
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,645
Does that mean
there is a way?

Since you're not real,

00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:05,112
there's not much point
in continuing
this conversation, is there?

291
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,353
Our circuits are
beginning to heat.

292
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,980
We'll have to cease power.

293
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,693
Disengage.

294
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,542
The top of that knoll

295
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,419
should have been sheared off
the first second.

296
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,922
Maybe it was.
I tried to explain.

297
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,716
Their power of illusion
is so great,

298
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,844
we can't be sure
of anything we do,

299
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,304
of anything we see.

300
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,983
Perhaps if you
asked me some questions

301
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,194
I could answer.

302
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:12,239
How far can they
control my mind?

303
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,116
If I tell you,

304
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,494
then will you pick
some dream you've had

305
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,205
and let me
live it with you?

306
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,665
Perhaps.

307
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,959
They--they can't actually
make you do anything

308
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,878
you don't want to do.

309
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,838
But they try to trick me
with their illusions.

310
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,341
They can punish you when
you're not cooperative.

311
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,303
Did they ever live
on the surface of this planet?

312
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,849
Why did they
go underground?

313
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,976
War, thousands
of centuries ago.

314
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,936
That's why it's
so barren up there?

315
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,023
The planet's only now becoming
able to support life again.

316
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,650
So the Talosians
who came underground

317
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,360
found life
limited here

318
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,946
and they concentrated on
developing their mental power.

319
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,615
But they found
it's a trap...

320
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,367
like a narcotic,

321
00:17:56,367 --> 00:18:01,039
because when dreams
become more important
than reality,

322
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,875
you give up travel,
building, creating.

323
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,878
You even forget how
to repair the machines

324
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,922
left behind
by your ancestors.

325
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,256
You just sit,

326
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,884
living and reliving
other lives

327
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,219
left behind
in the thought record.

328
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,180
Or sit probing minds of
zoo specimens like me.

329
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,016
You're better
than a theater to them.

330
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,684
They create
the illusion for you.

331
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,477
They watch you react,

332
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,021
feel your emotions.

333
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,690
They have a whole
collection of specimens,

334
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,401
descendants of life
brought back long ago

335
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,071
from all over this part
of the galaxy.

336
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:37,199
Which means they had
to have more than one

337
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,410
of each animal.

338
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,578
Please.

339
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,204
They'll need
a pair of humans.

340
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,206
Where will they
get the Earth woman?

341
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,751
You said that if
I answered your questions--

342
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,503
That was a bargain
with something
that didn't exist.

343
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,966
You said you weren't
real, remember?

344
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:02,141
I'm a woman as real
and as human as you are.

345
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,229
We are like Adam and Eve.

346
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,523
If we--

347
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,567
Don't! Please!

348
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,736
Don't punish me!

349
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:14,904
I'll die!

350
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,073
Ohh! Aah!

351
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,508
An Earth woman?

352
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,760
You were captured
as breeding stock?

353
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,056
Why?

354
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,642
Just to maintain
a supply of zoo specimens?

355
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,227
Much more, Captain.

356
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:18,009
The vial contains a nourishing
protein complex.

357
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,469
Is the keeper
actually communicating

358
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,971
with one of his animals?

359
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,558
If the form and the color
is not appealing,

360
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:30,521
it can appear as any food
you wish to visualize.

361
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,522
And if I prefer...

362
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,357
To starve?

363
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,527
You overlook
the unpleasant alternative

364
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,029
of punishment.

365

00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,225
has the superior mind

543
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,977
and would produce
highly intelligent children.

544
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,689
All I want to do
is get my hands on you.

545
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,024
Can you read
these thoughts--

546
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,611
images of hate,
killing?

547
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:29,281
The other new arrival has
considered you unreachable

548
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,909
but now realizes
this has changed.

549
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:35,287
The factors in her favor
are youth and strength

550
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,998
plus unusually strong
female drives.

551
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,627
You'll find my thoughts
more interesting,

552
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,463
thoughts so primitive
you can't understand.

553
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,756
Emotions so--

554
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,215
Oh!

555
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,723
Wrong thinking
is punishable.

556
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:58,059
Right thinking
will be as quickly rewarded.

557
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:02,397
You will find it an
effective combination.

558
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,198
Captain--

559
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,158
No.

560
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,827
No. Don't help me.

561
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,995
I have to concentrate.

562
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,623
They can't read
through hate.

563
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,873
You hold still,
or I'll--

564
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,833
Don't hurt them.
They don't mean to be evil.

565
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:06,003
I've had some samples
of how good they are.

566
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,883
[ Grrrr ]

567
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:20,684
You stop this illusion,
or I'll twist your head off.

568
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,651
All right.

569
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,737
Now, you try
one more illusion,

570
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,155
you try anything at all,
and I'll break your neck.

571
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,993
Your ship...

572
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:43,456
release me,
or we'll destroy it.

573
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,836
He's not bluffing,
Captain.

574
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,463
They can make your crew
work the wrong controls

575
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:54,843
or push any button
it takes to destroy your ship.

576
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,929
I'm going to gamble
you're too intelligent

577
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,305
to kill
for no reason at all.

578
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,656
On the other hand,
I've got a reason.

579
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,868
I bet you've created
an illusion this laser is empty.

580
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:23,789
I think it blasted a hole
that you keep us from seeing.

581
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,666
Want me to test my theory out
on your head?

582
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,379
Captain.

583
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,450
Seems the Talosians
have deserted you.

584
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,121
Gentlemen,
a moment, please.

585
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,210
Well, Mr. Spock?

586
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,633
May I have
your verdict?

587
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,301
Signal you want
them to wait.

588
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,806
Captain, please.
It's your life now...

589
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,557
at least
a chance for life.

590
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,103
You keep talking about life,
a chance for life.

591
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,939
How? As a prisoner,

592
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,859
caged, a zoo specimen,

593
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,402
living the illusions
that amuse his keepers?

594
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,697
No, Captain.
there's more to it.

595
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,532
Watch.

596
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,831
Guilty, yes or no,
Captain?

597
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,797
Yes.

598
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,842
I must also vote
guilty as charged.

599
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,097
And you, Captain?

600
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,688
Guilty...

601
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,190
as charged.

602
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,203
Security control
affirmative.

603
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:27,954
Stand to,
forward phaser.

604
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,372
Aft scanner
to bridge.

605
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,124
Bridge to commander.

606
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,793
Mendez here.

607
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,046
Sir, we're entering
orbit Talos IV.

608
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,423
Talos controls
the vessel now, sir,

609
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,175
as they 13 did years ago.

610
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,801
You've asked me why.

611
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:45,388
You'll see the answer now.

612
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,789
Make contact,
Number One.

613
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,958
They kept us
from seeing this, too.

614
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:16,502
We cut through
and never knew it.

615
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,337
Captain.

616
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,885
As you see,

617
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,888
your attempt to escape
accomplished nothing.

618
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,556
I want to contact
our ship.

619
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,600
You're now
on the surface

620
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,685
where we
wished you to be.

621
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,521
With the female
of your choice,

622
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:39,484
you will now begin
carefully guided lives.

623
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,653
And start
by burying you?

624
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,656
That is your choice.

625
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,617
To help you reclaim
the planet's surface,

626
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:51,704
our zoological gardens
will furnish a variety
of plant life.

627
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,748
I'll make a deal
with you.

628
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,042
You and your life

629
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,919
for the lives
of these two Earth women.

630
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,005
Show proof our
ship's all right,

631
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,506
send these two back,

632
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,382
and I'll stay
with Vina.

633
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,852
It's wrong to create
a race of humans
to live as slaves.

634
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,729
Is this a deception?

635
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,191
Do you intend
to destroy yourselves?

636
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,775
What's that?

637
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,943
The weapon
is building up an overload,

638
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,236
a forced chamber explosion.

639
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,324
You still have time
to get underground.

640
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,743
Well, go on!

641
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:38,877
Just to show you how primitive
humans are, Talosian,

642
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,920
you go with her.

643
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,964
If--if you all think

644
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,466
it's this important,
then...

645
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,719
I can't go, either.

646
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,596
I suppose if they
have one human being,

647
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,308
they might try again.

648
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,188
Wait.

649
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:06,529
Their method of storing records
is crude and consumed much time.

650
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,531
Are you prepared
to assimilate it?

651
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,009
We had not believed
this possible.

652
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,887
The customs and
history of your race

653
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:34,891
show a unique hatred
of captivity.

654
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,977
Even when it's pleasant
and benevolent,

655
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,313
you prefer death.

656
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:43,566
This makes you too violent
and dangerous a species

657
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,443
for our needs.

658
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,362
He means that...

659
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,863
they can't use you.

660
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,865
You're free to go
back to the ship.

661
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,454
And that's it.

662
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,541
No apologies...

663
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,627
you captured one of us,
threatened all of us.

664
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:06,798
Your unsuitability
has condemned the Talosian race

665
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,883
to eventual death.

666
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,385
Is this not sufficient?

667
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:14,180
No other specimen
has shown your adaptability.

668
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,224
You were our last hope.

669
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:20,728
But wouldn't
some form of trade...

670
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,647
mutual cooperation...

671
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,400
Your race would learn
our power of illusion

672
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,943
and destroy
itself, too.

673
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,194
[ Intercom Whistles ]

674
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,863
Captain, we have
transporter control now.

675
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,082
Let's get back
to the ship.

676
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,380
I can't.

677
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,090
I can't go with you.

678
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,051
Sir, it just came on.
We can't shut the power off.

679
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,803
- [ Intercom Whistles ]
- Mr. Spock here.

680
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:57,140
All power has come on.
The helm is answering
to control.

681
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,461
The captain.

682
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,623
You see why
I can't go with you.

683
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,545
This is the female's
true appearance.

684
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,759
They found me
in the wreckage, dying,

685
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,929
a lump of flesh.

686
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:21,516
They rebuilt me.
Everything works.

687
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,894
But they had never
seen a human.

688
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,688
They had no guide

689
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,567
for putting me
back together.

690
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,709
It was necessary
to convince you

691
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,337
her desire to stay
is an honest one.

692
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,299
You'll give her back
her illusion of beauty?

693
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,175
And more.

694
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:15,403
Mr. Spock, the system
is coming on again.

695
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,882
What's happened
to Vina?

696
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,301
Isn't she
coming with us?

697
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,553
No.

698
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:43,515
No, and I agreed
with her reasons.

699
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,066
All decks prepare
for hyperdrive.

700
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,735
All decks
are ready, sir.

701
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,364
Engage.

702
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,812
Commodore,
don't you think that--

703
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,411
What you now seem to hear,
Captain Kirk,

704
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:49,080
are my thought
transmissions.

705
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,083
The commodore was
never aboard your vessel.

706
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,960
His presence there
and in the shuttlecraft

707
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,462
was an illusion.

708
00:45:56,462 --> 00:46:00,757
Mr. Spock had related to us
your strength of will.

709
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:04,262
It was thought the fiction
of a court-martial

710
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:09,141
would divert you
from too soon regaining
control of your vessel.

711
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,060
Captain Pike is welcome

712
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,896
to spend the rest
of his life with us,

713
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,108
unfettered
by his physical body.

714
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,444
The decision is yours...

715
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,654
and his.

716
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,043
Mr. Spock,

717
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,963
even if regulations
are explicit,

718
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,923
you could have come to me
and explained.

719
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:45,136
Ask you to face
the death penalty, too?

720
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,512
