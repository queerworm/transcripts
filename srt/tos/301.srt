72
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,012
HIS BRAIN IS GONE.

73
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,684

74
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,983

EVERY NERVE ENDING
IN THE BRAIN

00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,489

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,036
IT'S A MEDICAL MIRACLE.

81
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:12,080
IF HIS BRAIN
IS MISSING...

82
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,456
THEN SPOCK IS DYING.

83
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,042

93
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,073
SHE TOOK IT.

94
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,449

95
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,577
OR WHERE...

96
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,913
BUT SHE MUST'VE
TAKEN IT.

97
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,415

KEEP HIM FUNCTIONING.

98
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,417
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
ANY GUARANTEE.

99
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,794
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
DOCTOR.

100
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,173
IF IT HAPPENED
TO ANY OF US,
I'D SAY INDEFINITELY.

101
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,176
BUT VULCAN PHYSIOLOGY
LIMITS WHAT I CAN DO.

102
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,096
SPOCK'S BODY
IS MUCH MORE DEPENDENT
ON THAT TREMENDOUS BRAIN

103

FOR LIFE SUPPORT.

104
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,600
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO
TAKE HIM WITH US.

105
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,853
TAKE HIM WHERE?

106
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,190
IN SEARCH OF HIS BRAIN,
DOCTOR.

107
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,610
FROM WHAT YOU SAY,
THE MOMENT WE FIND IT,

108
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:27,655
WE MUST RESTORE IT
TO HIS BODY,
OR WE LOSE HIM.

109
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,034

GOING TO LOOK

110
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,661
IN THIS
WHOLE GALAXY?

111
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,665
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING TO LOOK
FOR SPOCK'S BRAIN?

112
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,002
HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO FIND IT?

113
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,587
I'LL FIND IT.

114
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,548
EVEN IF YOU DO,
I CAN'T RESTORE IT.

115
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,093
I DON'T HAVE
THE MEDICAL
TECHNIQUE.

116
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,095
IT WAS TAKEN OUT.

117
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,097
IT CAN BE PUT BACK IN.

118
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,058
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW.

119
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,978
THE THIEF THAT TOOK IT
HAS THE KNOWLEDGE.

120
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,896
I'LL FORCE IT
OUT OF HER.

121
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,023
IF YOU DON'T FIND IT
IN 24 HOURS,

122

180
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,063
YET ONE OF THEM
ACCOMPLISHED IT.
YES, SIR.

181
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,607
THANK YOU, MR. CHEKOV.

182
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,067
CAPTAIN, I'M PICKING UP
HIGH ENERGY GENERATION

183
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,444
ON PLANET 6.

184
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,070
THAT'S THE PRIMITIVE
GLACIATED PLANET.
YES, SIR.

185
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,156
THE SOURCE OF IT?

186
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,657
IT COULD BE NATURAL--

187
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,494
VOLCANIC ACTIVITY, STEAM,
ANY OF A NUMBER OF CAUSES--

188
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,536
BUT IT'S VERY REGULAR.

189
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,038
WHAT DO
YOUR SURFACE
READINGS SHOW?

190
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,249
NO SIGN OF
ORGANIZED CIVILIZATION.

191
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,668
PRIMITIVE HUMANOIDS
PICKED UP AT
IRREGULAR INTERVALS.

192
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,004
WITH REGULAR PULSATIONS
OF GENERATED ENERGY?

193
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,756
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT, SIR.

194
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,178
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO GUESS WRONG.

195
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,473
I'VE GOT TO CHOOSE
THE RIGHT PLANET
TO GET THERE,

196
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,057
FIND THE BRAIN.

197
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,059
8 HOURS
AND 35 MINUTES.

198
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,102
RECOMMENDATIONS,
MR. CHEKOV.

199
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,979
SIGMA DRACONIS 3.

200
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,524
IT'S CLOSEST.
HEAVIEST POPULATION.

201
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,567
BUT A TECHNOLOGICAL
RATING OF ONLY 3.

202
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,278
THEY COULDN'T PUT POSSIBLY HAVE
PUT THAT SHIP WE SAW INTO SPACE.

203
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,613
NONE OF THESE PLANETS
COULD.

204
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,618
I SAY PLANET 4, CAPTAIN.

205
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,287
AT LEAST PLANET 4
IS AHEAD OF 3,
TECHNOLOGICALLY.

206
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,039
BUT ADVANCED ION PROPULSION

207
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,582
IS BEYOND
EVEN OUR CAPABILITIES.

208
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,043
IT'D BE A MIRACLE
IF THEY HAD DEVELOPED IT.

209
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,629
WHAT WOULD THEY WANT
WITH HIS BRAIN?

210
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,048
WHAT WOULD THEY WANT
WITH MR. SPOCK'S BRAIN?

211
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,468
WHAT USE IS IT?
WHY DO THEY WANT IT?

212
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,095
YES. WHY WOULD THEY
WANT IT?

213
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,682
8 HOURS AND 34 MINUTES.

214
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,434
PLANET 6 IS GLACIATED,
YOU SAY?

215
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,687
SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS,
AT LEAST.

216
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,105
ONLY THE TROPICAL ZONE
IS ICE-FREE.

217
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,440
BUT THE ENERGY.

218
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:13,358
REGULAR.

219
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,942
IT'S THERE.

220
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,444
IT'S REAL.

221
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,238
YES, SIR.

222
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,824
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,
BUT IT'S THERE.

223
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,661
HAVE THE TRANSPORTER ROOM
STAND BY.

224
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,997
I'M TAKING A LANDING PARTY
DOWN TO PLANET 6.

225
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,499
AYE, AYE, SIR.

226
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,625
A HUNCH, CAPTAIN?

227
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,254
A HUNCH, MR. SULU.

228
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,592
WHAT IF YOU
GUESS WRONG,
CAPTAIN?

229
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,469
IF I GUESS WRONG,
MR. SPOCK IS DEAD.

230
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,930
SPOCK WILL DIE.

231
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,358
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 4351.5.</i>

232
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,903
<i>WE ARE BEAMING DOWN TO A</i>
<i>PRIMITIVE GLACIATED PLANET</i>

233
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,155
<i>IN THE SIGMA DRACONIS</i>
<i>STAR SYSTEM.</i>

234
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,240
<i>TIME LEFT TO US</i>
<i>TO FIND SPOCK'S BRAIN--</i>

235
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,200
<i>8 HOURS AND 29 MINUTES.</i>

236
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,369
SUIT TEMPERATURES TO 72.

237
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,546
LIFE FORM READINGS,
MR. SPOCK--

238
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,131
MR. SCOTT?

239
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,173
SCATTERED.

240
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,550
WIDELY SPACED.

241
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,176
HUMANOID, ALL RIGHT.

242
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,762
ON THE LARGE SIDE.

243
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,184
WATCH OUT. WE KNOW
THEIR DEVELOPMENT
IS PRIMITIVE.

244
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,645
AYE.

245
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,152
READOUT, MR. CHEKOV.

246
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,737
NO STRUCTURES, CAPTAIN.

247
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,739
NO MECHANIZED OBJECTS
THAT I CAN READ.

248
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,451
NO SURFACE CONSUMPTION,
NO GENERATION OF ENERGY.

249
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,123
ATMOSPHERE IS PERFECTLY
ALL RIGHT, OF COURSE.

250
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,542
TEMPERATURE,
A HIGH MAXIMUM OF 40.

251
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,169
LIVABLE.

252
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,755
YOU HAVE A THICK SKIN.

253
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,009
CAPTAIN!

254
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,766
THERE'S SOMEONE,
SOMETHING OUT THERE
IN THE ROCKS.

255
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,185
FIVE OF THEM.
HUMANOID, LARGE.

256
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,020
PHASERS ON STUN.

257
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,357
I WANT THEM CONSCIOUS.

258
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,847
FIRE ONLY ON MY SIGNAL.

259
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,020
FLANK OUT.

260
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,363
CHEKOV.

261
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,997
GRRR!
YAAH!
AAH!

262
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,565
WE MEAN YOU NO HARM.

263
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,484
WE'RE NOT YOUR ENEMIES.
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.

264
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,987
WE ONLY WISH
TO TALK TO YOU.

265
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,157
YOU...

266
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,785
ARE NOT THE OTHERS?

267
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,327
NO.

268
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,163
WE COME FROM
A FAR PLACE.

269
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,916
WE ARE MEN.

270
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,042
MEN?

271
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,043
LIKE YOURSELVES.

272
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,380
YOU ARE SMALL...

273
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,091
LIKE THE OTHERS.

274
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,135
WHO ARE THE OTHERS?

275
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,387
THE GIVERS OF PAIN...

276
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,098
AND DELIGHT.

277
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,102
DO THEY LIVE HERE
WITH YOU?

278
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,105
NO. THEY COME.

279
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,399
THEY GIVE PAIN
AND DELIGHT.

280
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,776
DO THEY COME
FROM THE SKY?

281
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,986
THEY ARE HERE.

282
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,114
YOU WILL SEE.

283
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,117
THE OTHERS
WILL COME FOR YOU.

284
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,579
THEY COME...
FOR ALL LIKE US.

285
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,582
DO THEY COME
FOR YOUR WOMEN AS WELL?

286
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,918
WOMEN?

287
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,169
THE FEMALE OF YOUR KIND.

288
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:47,924
YOUR WORDS SAY NOTHING.

289
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,594
DON'T YOU HAVE A MATE?

290
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,222
MATE?

291
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,183
A COMPANION.

292
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,024
WILL YOU TAKE US WHERE
WE CAN FIND THE OTHERS?

293
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,109
NO ONE WANTS
TO FIND THEM.

294
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,028
WE DO. WE WANT
TO FIND THEM.

295
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,489
TAKE US THERE,
AND WE'LL LET YOU GO.

296
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,032
CAPTAIN, 500 METERS
IN THAT DIRECTION,

297
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,075
THERE'S A FOUNDATION
UNDER THE SURFACE.

298
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,118
A HUGE ONE.

299
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,537
REGISTRATIONS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

300
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,788
BUILDINGS?

301
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,206
YES, SIR. IMMENSELY OLD,
COMPLETELY BURIED.

302
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,124
BUT THEY WERE HERE ONCE.

303
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,752
SOMEWHERE DOWN THERE
IS WHERE THE OTHERS LIVE.

304
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,128
SCOTTY, SEE IF YOU CAN
FIND A WAY DOWN.

305
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,464
NO! NO!
DO NOT GO THERE!

306
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,549
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

307
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,050
NO! NO!

308
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,761
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
LET HIM GO.

309
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,764
WHAT COULD THE OTHERS DO
TO CAUSE SUCH TERROR?

310
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,183
WHAT WAS THAT HE SAID,
"PAIN AND DELIGHT?"

311
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,184
A PECULIAR MIXTURE.

312
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,145
A DEAD AND BURIED CITY

313
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,649
ON A PLANET
IN A GLACIAL AGE.

314
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,109
AND THE MALE HUMANOID
WHO DOESN'T KNOW

315
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,529
THE MEANING OF
THE WORD FEMALE.

316
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,989
CAPTAIN!

317
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,993
OVER HERE, SIR!

318
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,748
THERE'S FOOD IN THERE
AND A WHOLE PILE OF OTHER STUFF.

319
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:05,043
A STOREHOUSE FOR
OUR MUSCULAR FRIENDS.

320
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,004
I DON'T THINK SO--
SCOTTY.

321
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,636
METAL. FORGED, TEMPERED.

322
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:19,181
OUR APISH FRIENDS
DIDN'T MAKE THESE.

323
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,141
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

324
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,727
IT COULD BE
A WARNING DEVICE

325
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,772
TO KEEP
THOSE CREATURES
AWAY FROM THE FOOD.

326
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,190
OR THE FOOD COULD BE
A LURE SET BY THE OTHERS

327
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,068
TO BRING THEM IN HERE.

328
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,152
IN THAT CASE,
THE BEAM WOULD BE
A SIGNAL.

329
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,738
AND THIS CAVE, A TRAP.

330
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,156
IF IT TRAPS THE CREATURES
FOR THE OTHERS, CAPTAIN,

331
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,158
WON'T IT TRAP US, TOO?

332
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,368
EXACTLY.

333
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,663
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

334
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,497
ENTERPRISE.
<i>UHURA HERE.</i>

335
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,250
HAVE DR. McCOY
BEAM DOWN IMMEDIATELY.

336
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,877
<i>AYE, AYE, SIR.</i>

337
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:48,836
MR. CHEKOV, YOU
AND THE SECURITY TEAM

338
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,129
WILL REMAIN HERE
AT THE ENTRANCE,

339
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,548
WE'LL BE IN CONSTANT
CONTACT WITH YOU.

340
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,008
AYE, SIR.

341
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,157
ALL RIGHT, BONES.

342
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,034
BRING HIM ALONG.

343
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,015
KEEP HIM CLOSE
TO THE RIGHT.

344
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,022
READY?

345
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,734
[ENGINES START]

346
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,989
CALL CHEKOV AND TELL HIM
TO SEND MY STOMACH DOWN.

347
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,119
IT MIGHT BE A LONG WAIT.

348
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,997
WE MAY AS WELL
BE COMFORTABLE.

349
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,015
PHASERS ON STUN.

350
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,143
CAPTAIN, THAT POWER
WE PICKED UP ABOVE,

351
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,187
WE'RE GETTING CLOSER.

352
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,188
A LOT OF IT?

353
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,565
ENOUGH TO PUSH
THIS PLANET
OUT OF ORBIT.

354
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,816
WHAT SOURCE?

355
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,528

361
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,998

364
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,547
TAKE ME TO THE ONE IN CHARGE.
I WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM.

365
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,966
HIM? WHAT IS HIM?

366
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,009

WITH SPOCK'S BRAIN?

00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,136

IT IS CONTROLLER,
IS IT NOT?

483
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,113
YES, YES,
IN A WAY IT IS.

484
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,992
THE HUMAN BRAIN CONTROLS
THE INDIVIDUAL'S FUNCTIONS.

485

YOU LIE! YOU KNOW ME.
YOU HAVE SAID THAT.

494
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,772
YOU CAME TO TAKE BACK
THE CONTROLLER.

495
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,024
HE IS OUR FRIEND.

496
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,984
YOU MUST TAKE US TO HIM.

497
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,194
WE BEG YOU.

00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,570

00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,920
I MUST LEARN WHAT TO DO.

504
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,006
COME WITH ME.

505
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,007
KEEP THEM HERE.

506
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,842

WHAT A WAY TO MAINTAIN
CONTROL OVER A MAN.

530
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,473
"PAIN AND DELIGHT,"
HE SAID UP ABOVE.

531
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:10,225
I'M SURE YOU NOTICED
THE DELIGHT ASPECT
OF THIS PLACE.

532
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,019
YES, I CERTAINLY DID NOTICE
THOSE DELIGHTFUL ASPECTS.

533
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:13,646
BUT THAT, TOO,

534
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:16,440
WAS STRICTLY UNDER COMMAND
OF THE WOMEN.

535
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,067
HOW DOES
SPOCK'S BRAIN
FIT INTO THIS?

536
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,944
WITH A COMMUNICATOR,

537
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,197
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO FIND OUT.

538
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:31,622
THIS FELLOW
IS KEEPING US
FROM OUR PROPERTY.

539
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:35,167
ISN'T THERE A WAY
TO CORRECT THAT SITUATION?

540
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,002
I CERTAINLY THINK
THAT SCIENCE MIGHT
PROVIDE AN ANSWER.

541
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,044
IT DOES, CAPTAIN.

542
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,589
AGREED, DOCTOR.

543
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,741
SCIENCE WILL TRIUMPH.

544
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,034
COME ON, SCOTTY.

545
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,372
BONES, GIVE THEM SOMETHING
THAT WILL KEEP THEM OUT
FOR A WHILE.

546
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,373
SPOCK.

547
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,999
SPOCK.

548
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,876
COME ON, SPOCK.

549
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,880
SPOCK, YOU WERE ON
THIS FREQUENCY, SPOCK.

550
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,466
<i>YES, CAPTAIN,</i>
<i>I AM STILL HERE.</i>

551
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,386
<i>HAVE YOU RETURNED</i>
<i>TO THE</i> ENTERPRISE?

552
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,595
NO.

553
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,598
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO LOCATE YOU,

554
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:35,018
IF YOU GAVE US SOME IDEA OF
WHAT THEY WERE USING YOU FOR.

555
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,102
IS IT MEDICAL?

556
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,271
<i>I AM NOT CERTAIN.</i>

557
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,358
<i>I SEEM TO HAVE A BODY</i>
<i>WHICH STRETCHES</i>
<i>INTO INFINITY.</i>

558
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,067
BODY?

559
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,069
WHY, YOU HAVE NONE.

560
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,321
<i>THEN WHAT AM I?</i>

561
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,700
YOU ARE
A DISEMBODIED BRAIN.

562
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:50,450
<i>FASCINATING.</i>

563
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,495
<i>IT COULD EXPLAIN MUCH,</i>
<i>DOCTOR.</i>

564
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,582
<i>MY MEDULLA OBLONGATA</i>
<i>IS HARD AT WORK</i>

565
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:57,499
<i>APPARENTLY BREATHING,</i>

566
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,084
<i>APPARENTLY</i>
<i>PUMPING BLOOD,</i>

567
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,504
<i>APPARENTLY MAINTAINING</i>
<i>A NORMAL PHYSIOLOGIC</i>
<i>TEMPERATURE.</i>

568
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,257
SPOCK, WE DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THAT.

569
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:08,218
<i>WHY ARE YOU ENDANGERING</i>
<i>YOUR LIVES BY COMING HERE?</i>

570
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,846
WE CAME TO PUT YOU BACK.

571
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,055
WHERE ARE YOU?

572
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,682
<i>BACK WHERE?</i>

573
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,601
BACK INTO YOUR BODY.

574
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,977
WE BROUGHT IT
ALONG WITH US.

575
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,521
<i>THOUGHTFUL, CAPTAIN,</i>

576
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,939
<i>BUT PROBABLY IMPRACTICAL.</i>

577
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,608
<i>WHILE I MIGHT</i>
<i>TRUST THE DOCTOR</i>

578
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,569
<i>TO REMOVE A SPLINTER</i>
<i>OR LANCE A BOIL,</i>

579
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,988
<i>I DO NOT BELIEVE</i>
<i>HE HAS THE KNOWLEDGE</i>
<i>TO RESTORE A BRAIN.</i>

580
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,073
THANK YOU.

581
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,284
<i>NO DENIGRATION</i>
<i>INTENDED, DR. McCOY.</i>

582
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:35,537
<i>THAT SKILL DOES NOT YET</i>
<i>EXIST IN THE GALAXY.</i>

583
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,956
THE SKILL TO REMOVE IT
EXISTS RIGHT WHERE WE ARE.

584
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,958
RESTORING IT MUST
ALSO BE POSSIBLE.

585
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,628
THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT
TO GET TO YOU AS QUICKLY
AS WE CAN.

586
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:45,631
<i>CAPTAIN, I APPRECIATE</i>
<i>THE RISKS YOU'RE TAKING</i>
<i>ON MY BEHALF,</i>

587
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,341
<i>BUT I MUST INSIST</i>
<i>THAT THEY ARE WORTHWHILE</i>

588
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,052
<i>ONLY IF THERE'S</i>
<i>A REASONABLE CHANCE</i>
<i>FOR SUCCESS.</i>

589
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,138
<i>LET ME ASK YOU,</i>
<i>HOW MUCH TIME</i>
<i>HAS ELAPSED SINCE--</i>

590
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,390
18 HOURS AND 12 MINUTES.

591
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,435
<i>DR. McCOY MUST'VE TOLD YOU</i>
<i>THAT 24 HOURS</i>

592
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,312
<i>IS THE MAXIMUM</i>
<i>MY BODY CAN--</i>

593
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,272
I TOLD HIM.

594
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:07,026
THAT LEAVES US
EXACTLY 5 HOURS
AND 48 MINUTES, SPOCK.

595
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,904
<i>IT DOES SEEM</i>
<i>ALL TOO BRIEF A TIME</i>

596
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:09,988
<i>TO DEVELOP SUCH SKILLS,</i>

597
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,406
<i>DOES IT NOT?</i>

598
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,366
YES.

599
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,785
VERY BRIEF.

600
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,954
THAT'S WHY WE MUST
GET TO YOU IMMEDIATELY.

601
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,956
BEAM US A SIGNAL
SO WE CAN HOME IN ON.

602
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,373
<i>ACKNOWLEDGED.</i>

603
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,001
[BEEP]

604
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,002
GOT IT.

605
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,838
BONES.

606
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:55,951
OH, SPOCK,
ONE QUESTION.

607
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,619
<i>YES, CAPTAIN.</i>

608
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,496
WE'VE GOT PAIN-GIVING
DEVICES ATTACHED TO US.

609
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,498
CAN YOU TELL US HOW
TO GET THEM OFF?

610
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,209
<i>I SHALL GIVE IT</i>
<i>TOP-PRIORITY.</i>

611
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:14,928
<i>CAPTAIN, I HAVE</i>
<i>AN ANSWER FOR YOU.</i>

612
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,848
<i>IT SEEMS YOUR PAIN BANDS</i>
<i>ARE MANUALLY CONTROLLED.</i>

613
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:21,894
<i>THE RED BUTTON</i>
<i>ON A BRACELET</i>
<i>RELEASES THEM.</i>

614
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:25,313
<i>I KNOW THAT DOES NOT</i>
<i>MAKE MUCH SENSE.</i>

615
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,566
OH, YES, IT DOES,
SPOCK.

616
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,707
KEEP CONCENTRATING,
SPOCK.

617
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,710
KEEP CONCENTRATING,
SPOCK.

618
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,633
MUST BE IN THERE,
CAPTAIN.

619
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,784
JIM...

620
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,453
SPOCK...

621
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,162
NO PAIN.

622
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,346
NO.

623
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,728
GO AWAY.

624
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,296
WE WILL DIE!

625
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,714
YOU MUST NOT TAKE
THE CONTROLLER AWAY.

626
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,299
WE WILL ALL DIE!

627
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,136
THE CONTROLLER IS
YOUNG AND POWERFUL.

628
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,512
PERFECT!

629
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:21,930
<i>HOW VERY FLATTERING.</i>

630
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,432
YOU WILL GIVE LIFE
TO MY PEOPLE
FOR 10,000 YEARS TO COME.

631
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,392
YOU'LL FIND
ANOTHER CONTROLLER.

632
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:27,352
THE OLD ONE
IS FINISHED!

633
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,980
THERE IS
NO OTHER
THAN THIS

634
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,815
AND WILL NOT
BE ANOTHER FOR
10,000 YEARS.

635
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,362
SPOCK, YOU'RE IN
A BLACK BOX TIED IN
WITH LIGHT RAYS

636
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,365
INTO A COMPLEX
CONTROL PANEL.

637
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,283
<i>FASCINATING.</i>

638
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,910
YOU SAY
YOU'RE BREATHING,

639
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,371
PUMPING BLOOD,

640
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,790
MAINTAINING
TEMPERATURE?

641
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:53,378
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOU'RE
RECIRCULATING AIR,

642
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,796
RUNNING
HEATING PLANTS,

643
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,755
PURIFYING WATER?

644
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,340
<i>INDEED, CAPTAIN.</i>

645
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,342
<i>THAT IS UNQUESTIONABLY</i>
<i>PART OF WHAT I AM DOING.</i>

646
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,427
HE MUST STAY!
HE MUST STAY!

647
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,638
HE WILL NOT STAY.

648
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,435
NOW, YOU TOOK HIS BRAIN.

649
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,437
YOU WILL PUT IT BACK.

650
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,898
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

651
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,691
I DO NOT KNOW.

652
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:15,650
SHE COULDN'T, JIM.

653
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,528
HER MIND IS FUNCTIONING
ON A VERY SIMPLE LEVEL.

654
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,406
MENTAL FACULTIES
DOWN HERE SEEM TO BE
ALMOST ATROPHIED

655
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,366
BECAUSE OF NONUSE.

656
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,035
SHE WAS ON
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

657
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,161
SHE MUST HAVE DONE IT.
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

658
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,080
IT WAS
THE OLD KNOWLEDGE.

659
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:29,664
HOW DO YOU GET IT?

660
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,084
I PUT UPON MY HEAD
THE TEACHER.

661
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,668
WHAT IS THE TEACHER?

662
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,671
THE GREAT TEACHER OF
ALL THE ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE.

663
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,381
<i>IF I MAY EXPLAIN, CAPTAIN,</i>

664
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,592
<i>SHE REFERS TO</i>
<i>THE TAPE STOREHOUSE</i>

<i>OF THIS PLACE.</i>

666
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,264
<i>I SCAN IT.</i>
<i>A MOST IMPRESSIVE STORE.</i>

667
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,860
HOW DOES IT WORK?
SHOW US.

668
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,361
I CANNOT.

669
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,947
YOU MUST TELL US.

670
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:02,822
I CANNOT.

671
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:06,534
ONLY BY COMMAND
OF THE ANCIENTS
MAY I UNDERSTAND.

672
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,411
HOW DOES IT WORK?
SHOW US!

673
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,205
WE'LL PROTECT YOU.
YOU WON'T COME
TO ANY HARM.

674
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,291
<i>IT IS A DEVICE</i>
<i>WITH FEEDING CIRCUITS.</i>

675
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,627
<i>THEY LEAD INTO THE MIND</i>
<i>OF THE PRIESTESS LEADER.</i>

676
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:19,923
<i>ITS USE IS STRICTLY</i>
<i>PREDETERMINED</i>
<i>BY THE BUILDERS.</i>

677
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,217
NO! KNOWLEDGE IS FORBIDDEN!

678
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,052
I MUST NOT KNOW THE SECRET!

679
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,304
I'LL BE PUNISHED!

680
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,005
GENTLEMEN...

681
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,925
THE CONTROLLER'S EXPLANATION
OF THE FUNCTIONING
OF THE TEACHER

682
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,384
IS ESSENTIALLY CORRECT.

683
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,346
HOWEVER, HE IS GIVING
NO CREDIT TO ME.

684
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,141
I PROVIDE THE MEANS
WHEREBY THE KNOWLEDGE
IS USED.

685
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,851
WITHOUT ME, CAPTAIN--

686
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,603
WITHOUT YOU
THERE COULD BE
NO DELICATE MIRACLE

687
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,563
THAT KEPT SPOCK'S
BRAIN ALIVE.

688
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,191
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

689
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:20,775
THAT WAS VERY GRACIOUS.

690
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,446
YES. FROM THE VERY FIRST,
I APPRECIATED YOUR ABILITY.

691
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,032
GOOD, CAPTAIN KIRK.

692
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,492
THEN YOU WILL ALSO APPRECIATE
THAT WITHOUT THE TEACHER,

693
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,537
I WOULD NOT HAVE
THE KNOWLEDGE TO USE

694
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,832
THAT WHICH YOU HAVE
THOUGHTFULLY PROVIDED.

695
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,421
THAT PHASER
IS SET TO KILL.

696
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,008
SO IT IS.

697
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,594
THAT IS THE KNOWLEDGE
YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME.

698
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,482
DO NOT MOVE.

699
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,484
IF YOUR WEAPON KILLS,
IT WILL KILL YOU.

00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,154
WE'RE NOT THE FIRST TO
BRING YOU THE KNOWLEDGE
OF KILLING.

701
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,323
IF YOU CONTINUE,
YOU'LL KILL SPOCK.

702
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,367
THE CONTROLLER DIE?

703
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,370
THE CONTROLLER WILL
LIVE FOR 10,000 YEARS,

704
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,663
AND WE SHALL GIVE HIM
ALL OUR DEVOTION.

705
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,249
BUT SPOCK WILL BE DEAD.

706
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:19,709
HIS BODY'S DYING
THIS MINUTE.

707
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,711
WHY DO YOU
NOT UNDERSTAND THAT

708
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,214
THE NEED OF MY PEOPLE
FOR THEIR CONTROLLER

709
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,383
IS GREATER
THAN YOUR NEED
FOR YOUR FRIEND?

710
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,051
NO ONE MAY KILL A MAN!

711
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,802
NOT FOR ANY PURPOSE.
IT CANNOT BE CONDONED.

712
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,721
DO NOT!

713
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,558
I DO NOT KNOW KILLING.
I DO NOT WISH TO KILL.

714
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,019
AH...

715
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,193
THE COMMANDMENT
MUST BE FULFILLED.

716
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,569
YOU MUST HELP US.

717
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,115
WHEN YOU CAME
TO THE SHIP,

718
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,200
YOU HAD THE KNOWLEDGE.

719
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,827
YET, WHEN WE CAME HERE,
YOU DIDN'T.

720
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,537
CORRECT.

721
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,497
HOW LONG DOES
THE KNOWLEDGE LAST?

722
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,583
THREE OF YOUR HOURS.

723
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,501
THAT WOULD BE
JUST ENOUGH TIME.

724
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,379
IF YOU HAD
THE KNOWLEDGE,

725
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,672
COULD YOU RESTORE
WHAT YOU'VE TAKEN?

726
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,091
I WOULD NOT.

727
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,885
YOU MUST HELP US.

728
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,305
YOU MUST RESTORE
WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE

729
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,639
WHAT YOU HAVE TAKEN.

730
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:15,473
NO!

731
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,351
YOU MUST PUT BACK
WHAT YOU HAVE TAKEN.

732
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,396
I WILL NOT BETRAY
MY PEOPLE.

733
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,481
THE CONTROLLER WILL STAY.

734
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,209
JIM, IT WORKED FOR HER.

735
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:44,043
IT MIGHT WORK FOR ME.

736
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,171
<i>SHE IS AN ALIEN.</i>

737
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,173
<i>THE CONFIGURATIONS</i>
<i>OF HER BRAIN ARE DIFFERENT.</i>

738
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:52,051
<i>IT COULD CAUSE IRREPARABLE</i>
<i>DAMAGE TO YOUR HUMAN BRAIN,</i>
<i>DOCTOR.</i>

739
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,470
I'M A SURGEON ALREADY.

740
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,472
IF I COULD LEARN
THESE TECHNIQUES,

741
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,016
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO RETAIN THEM.

742
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,102
<i>CAPTAIN, YOU MIGHT LOSE</i>
<i>THE DOCTOR THAT WAY.</i>

743
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,770
HE MIGHT,

744
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,939
BUT WE'RE SURE TO LOSE
YOU IF I DON'T TRY.

745
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,485
<i>I CANNOT ALLOW YOU</i>
<i>TO JEOPARDIZE YOUR LIFE</i>
<i>FOR ME.</i>

746
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,986
SPOCK,
DIDN'T YOU HEAR?

747
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,323
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO RETAIN AND BRING

748
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,159
THESE TECHNIQUES
TO THE WORLD.

749
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,828
JIM, ISN'T IT WORTH
THAT RISK?

750
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:23,166
WOULDN'T YOU INSIST
UPON TAKING SUCH
A RISK YOURSELF?

751
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,879
GO AHEAD, DOCTOR.

752
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,714
PUT THE TEACHER ON.

753
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:34,719
NO!

754
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,104
OF COURSE.

755
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,066
OF COURSE.

756
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,070
A CHILD COULD DO IT.

757
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,074
A CHILD COULD DO IT.

758
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,920
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG.</i>
<i>STARDATE 5432.3.</i>

759
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,965
<i>DR. McCOY IS PROCEEDING</i>
<i>TO RESTORE SPOCK'S BRAIN.</i>

760
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,841
<i>OUR PROBLEM--</i>

761
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,843
<i>WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG</i>

762
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,846
<i>HIS INCREASED</i>
<i>SURGICAL KNOWLEDGE</i>
<i>WILL STAY WITH HIM.</i>

763
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:04,392
<i>ANY ADDITIONAL ATTEMPT</i>
<i>TO USE THE TEACHING DEVICE</i>
<i>IS IMPOSSIBLE.</i>

764
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,394
<i>IT WOULD KILL</i>
<i>MY MEDICAL OFFICER.</i>

765
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,354
I HAVEN'T SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

766
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,356
HE'S OPERATING
AT WARP SPEED.

767
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:13,818
I'D LIKE A TRY
AT THAT TEACHER MYSELF.

768
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,820
YOU WILL HAVE HIM
BACK,

769
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,363
AND WE WILL
BE DESTROYED.

770
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:18,948
NO. YOU WON'T
BE DESTROYED.

771
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,742
YOU'LL BE WITHOUT
YOUR CONTROLLER
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

772
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,287
BUT YOU'LL BE
MUCH BETTER OFF,
I THINK.

773
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,538
WE WILL DIE.

774
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,416
NO. YOU WILL LIVE
AND DEVELOP AS YOU
SHOULD HAVE.

775
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,127
ALL THIS SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN DONE FOR YOU.

776
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:35,548
NOW THE WOMEN HERE BELOW
AND THE MEN HERE ABOVE
WILL CONTROL TOGETHER.

777
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,301
THEY WILL NOT HELP US
WITHOUT THE PAIN.

778
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,678
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS.
YOU'LL DISCOVER THEM.

779
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,598
YOU MUST MOVE TO THE SURFACE,
YOU UNDERSTAND.

780
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,933
WE WILL DIE ABOVE
IN THE COLD.

781
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,393
NO, YOU WON'T.

782
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,145
YOU'LL LEARN TO BUILD HOUSES,

783
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,314
TO KEEP WARM,
TO WORK.

784
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,566
WE'LL HELP YOU
FOR A WHILE.

785
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,693
HUMANS HAVE SURVIVED
UNDER WORSE CONDITIONS.

786
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,695
IT'S A MATTER OF EVOLUTION.

787
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,323
YOU'LL DO FINE.

788
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,616
CAPTAIN KIRK.

789
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,370
WHAT IS IT?

790
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,121
HE'S FORGETTING.

791
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,500
I CAN'T--I--

792
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,084
BONES.

793
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,462
BONES.

794
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:15,838
ALL THE GANGLIA--
THE NERVES.

795
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,299
THERE ARE A MILLION
OF THEM.

796
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,593
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

797
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:23,680
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

798
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,015
BONES, YOU CAN'T STOP NOW.

799
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,018
I'M TRYING TO THREAD A NEEDLE
WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER.

800
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,397
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

801
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:34,023
I DON'T REMEMBER.

802
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,317
BONES.

803
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,611
NO ONE CAN RESTORE A BRAIN.

804
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,445
YOU COULD.

805
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:42,907
A WHILE AGO,
IT WAS CHILD'S PLAY.

806
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,127
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG SUPPLEMENTAL.</i>

807
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:58,590
<i>OUR RACE AGAINST TIME</i>
<i>TO SAVE SPOCK'S LIFE</i>
<i>MAY HAVE BEEN FUTILE.</i>

808
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:00,799
<i>DR. McCOY HAS LOST</i>
<i>THE SURGICAL KNOWLEDGE</i>

809
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,218
<i>HE OBTAINED</i>
<i>FROM THE TEACHER.</i>

810
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:05,722
<i>HE HAS BEEN DRAWING</i>
<i>ON HIS OWN SKILLS</i>
<i>AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUES</i>

811
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,058
<i>IN AN ATTEMPT</i>
<i>TO CONTINUE THE OPERATION,</i>

812
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,143
<i>BUT HE IS FALTERING</i>
<i>AND UNCERTAIN.</i>

813
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,731
<i>IN A DESPERATE HOPE</i>
<i>THAT HE CAN DRAW ON SPOCK'S</i>
<i>BRAIN FOR ASSISTANCE,</i>

814
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,609
<i>I INSTRUCTED DR. McCOY</i>
<i>TO GIVE PRIORITY</i>

815
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:20,069
<i>TO CONNECTING</i>
<i>SPOCK'S VOCAL CHORDS.</i>

816
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:29,912
WELL?

817
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,332
HE'S DYING,
AND I CAN'T STOP IT.

818
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,252
YES...

819
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,379
DR. McCOY...

820
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,547
SPOCK.

821
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:44,969
IF YOU WILL FINISH
RECONNECTING
MY SPEECH CENTER,

822
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,554
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.

823
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,391
SPEECH CENTER.

824
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:55,271
YES. THAT'S CORRECT.

825
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,274
ONE THING AT A TIME.

826
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,817
AHH...

827
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,570
AHH...

828
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:04,656
MMM...

829
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:06,574
THAT'S BETTER.

830
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:11,370
NOW, DOCTOR,
TRY THE SONIC SEPARATOR.

831
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,623
SONIC SEPARATOR.

832
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:17,418
YES,
I BELIEVE I ALREADY HAVE
SOME SENSATION OF FEELING.

833
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,253
PLEASE STIMULATE
THE NERVE ENDINGS

834
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,088
AND OBSERVE
THE PHYSICAL REACTIONS,

835
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,590
ONE BY ONE.

836
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:27,804
IN EACH CASE,
I SHALL TELL YOU WHEN
THE PROBE IS CORRECT.

837
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,682
YOU WILL THEN SEAL USING
THE TRI-LASER CONNECTOR.

838
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,642
TRI-LASER CONNECTOR.

839
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:38,897
READY?

840
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,483
READY.

841
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:44,362
RIGHT FOREFINGER.

842
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,614
CORRECT.

843
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:49,617
RIGHT...

844
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,704
WRIST.

845
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:54,580
CORRECT.

846
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,377
RIGHT ELBOW.

847
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:02,547
CORRECT.

848
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:04,382
VERY GOOD, DOCTOR.

849
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,134
I'LL NEVER LIVE THIS DOWN--

850
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,012
THIS VULCAN IS TELLING ME
HOW TO OPERATE.

851
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:21,816
CLOSED.

852
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,693
WELL?

853
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,488
HOW DO I KNOW?
I COULD HAVE MADE
A THOUSAND MISTAKES.

854
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,949
SEALING NERVE ENDINGS,
JOINING GANGLIA.

855
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:34,078
THE FLUID BALANCE
IS CORRECT, BUT...

856
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,996
I DON'T KNOW.

857
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:47,216
CONGRATULATIONS, DOCTOR,
AND THANK YOU.

858
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,718
HOW DO YOU FEEL, SPOCK?

859
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:52,304
ON THE WHOLE, CAPTAIN,
I BELIEVE I'M QUITE FIT.

860
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,890
IT'S FASCINATING.

861
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,893
A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE
OF A RETROGRADE
CIVILIZATION.

862
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,271
AT THE PEAK,
ADVANCED BEYOND ANY
OF OUR CAPABILITIES

863
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:03,775
AND NOW OPERATING
AT THIS PRIMITIVE LEVEL
WHICH YOU SAW.

864
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,151
AND IT ALL BEGAN
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO

865
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,944
WHEN A GLACIAL AGE
REOCCURRED. YOU SEE,

866
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,114
THIS UNDERGROUND
COMPLEX WAS DEVELOPED
FOR THE WOMEN.

867
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:11,948
THE MEN REMAINED ABOVE.

868
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,577
AND A MALE-FEMALE SCHISM
TOOK PLACE.

869
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,620
A FASCINATING CULTURAL
DEVELOPMENT OF--

870
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,873
I KNEW IT WAS WRONG.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

871
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:19,665
WHAT'S THAT?

872
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,627
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
