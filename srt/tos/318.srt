00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:07,215
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 5725.3--

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,427
THE "ENTERPRISE" IS EN ROUTE
TO MEMORY ALPHA.

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,596
IT IS A PLANETOID
SET UP BY THE FEDERATION

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,932
SOLELY AS A CENTRAL LIBRARY,

5
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,976
CONTAINING THE TOTAL
CULTURAL HISTORY

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,477
AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE

7
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,647
OF ALL PLANETARY
FEDERATION MEMBERS.

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,525
WITH US IS SPECIALIST
LIEUTENANT MIRA ROMAINE.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,485
SHE IS ON BOARD
TO SUPERVISE THE TRANSFER

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,278
OF ALL NEWLY DESIGNED
EQUIPMENT

11
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,782
DIRECTLY FROM THE "ENTERPRISE"
TO MEMORY ALPHA.

12
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:35,285
YOU'RE THE SANEST,
THE SMARTEST,

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,247
THE NICEST WOMAN
THAT HAS EVER COME
ABOARD THIS SHIP.

14
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,457
ANYTHING ELSE?

15
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,252
ANYTHING ELSE I'LL...

16
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,006
I'LL KEEP TO MYSELF
FOR THE MOMENT.

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,300
Kirk: WHEN A MAN
OF SCOTTY'S YEARS FALLS IN LOVE,

18
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,679
THE LONELINESS OF HIS LIFE
IS SUDDENLY REVEALED TO HIM.

19
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,516
HIS WHOLE HEART ONCE THROBBED
ONLY TO THE SHIP'S ENGINES.

20
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,644
HE COULD TALK
ONLY TO THE SHIP.

21
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,271
NOW HE CAN SEE
NOTHING BUT THE WOMAN.

22
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,817
I DIDN'T THINK
MR. SCOTT WOULD GO
FOR THE BRAINY TYPE.

23
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,236
I DON'T THINK HE'S EVEN
NOTICED SHE HAS A BRAIN.

24
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,699
MR. SCOTT.

25
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,285
MR. SCOTT.

26
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,329
HMM?

27
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,957
AS SOON AS WE'RE WITHIN
VIEWING RANGE OF MEMORY ALPHA,

28
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,792
YOU AND LIEUTENANT ROMAINE
WILL GO TO YOUR POSITIONS

29
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,210
IN THE EMERGENCY
MANUAL MONITOR.

30
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,712
YOU'LL PREPARE FOR DIRECT
TRANSFER OF EQUIPMENT

31
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,672
TO MEMORY ALPHA.

32
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,548
AYE, CAPTAIN.

33
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,674
WE'RE READY, SIR.

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,967
Spock: LIEUTENANT,

35
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,677
MAY I OFFER
MY CONGRATULATIONS

36
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,638
ON WHAT WILL BE
YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT
FOR THE FEDERATION.

37
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:37,890
YES. GOOD LUCK,
LIEUTENANT.

38
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,098
THANK YOU.

39
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,230
[BEEPING]

40
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,231
CAPTAIN,
I'M PICKING UP

41
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,608
A HIGH INTENSITY
READING.

42
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,777
IS THAT MEMORY ALPHA?

43
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:50,652
NO, SIR.

44
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,493
EXCUSE ME.

45
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,248
MAGNIFICATION 8.

46
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,464
WHAT IS THAT?

47
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,424
INDICATIONS
ARE A STORM, CAPTAIN,

48
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,135
ALTHOUGH I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE
OF SUCH GREAT INTENSITY

49
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,512
OR STRANGE CONFORMATION.

50
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,139
Kirk: READINGS?

51
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,934
THE SENSOR READINGS ARE
AT MAXIMUM CALIBRATION.

52
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,184
CAPTAIN,
IT'S APPROACHING

53
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,938
AT WARP FACTOR 2.6
AND ACCELERATING.

54
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,689
CHECK THAT.

55
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:28,398
NO NATURAL PHENOMENA
CAN MOVE

56
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,233
FASTER THAN
THE SPEED OF LIGHT.

57
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,403
Spock: IT IS DEFINITELY
DOING SO, CAPTAIN.

58
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,156
THEREFORE IT CANNOT BE
A PHENOMENON OF NATURE.

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,212
DEFLECTORS ON,
CONDITION YELLOW.

60
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,380
Uhura: CONDITION
YELLOW, SIR.

00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,799

Kirk: SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

64
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:45,184
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

65
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,354
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--
TO EXPLORE STRANGE NEW WORLDS,

66
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,358
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,

67
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,486
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

68
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,868
[NO VOICE]

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,008
MR. SULU, GET US
THE DEVIL OUT OF HERE!

70
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,636
FULL SCAN ON THE DISTURBANCE
THAT PENETRATED THE BRIDGE.

71
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,139
LIEUTENANT, ALL DECKS--
DAMAGE REPORT.

72
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:07,557
MIRA!

73
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,812
Kirk: DR. McCOY, EMERGENCY.
EMERGENCY.

74
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,521
MIRA!

75
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,487
[LOW-PITCHED CROAKING]

76
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,864
Scotty: WHAT'S THAT
YOU'RE SAYING?

77
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,575
[CROAKING]

78
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:40,299
WAS SHE HURT BY THE FALL
OR THE ACTION OF
THE DISTURBANCE?

79
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,509
I DON'T KNOW.
DID YOU NOTICE, SCOTTY?

80
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,427
WELL, AFTER THE
DISTURBANCE WAS OVER,

81
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,971
SHE JUST COLLAPSED.

82
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,023
HOW'S SHE DOING,
DOCTOR?

83
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,858
WELL, I THINK
SHE'S COMING AROUND NOW.

84
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,027
EASY, NOW.

85
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,196
EASY. YOU HAD
QUITE A FALL.

86
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,406
[SIGHS]
I'M--I'M FINE.

87
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,786
YOU LET ME BE THE JUDGE
OF THAT.

88
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,205
DO YOU FEEL LIKE WALKING
TO SICK BAY?

89
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,582
I'M FINE, DOCTOR.
REALLY I AM.

90
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,625
IS EVERYBODY ELSE
ALL RIGHT?

91
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,835
AYE, THEY ARE.

92
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,212
NOW, YOU JUST DO
WHAT DR. McCOY
ORDERED.

93
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,130
WHY? I FEEL
PERFEC--

94
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,007
YOU GET TO
SICK BAY, LIEUTENANT.
THAT'S AN ORDER.

95
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,050
YES, SIR.

96
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,219
CAPTAIN, WOULD IT
BE ALL RIGHT IF I
WENT ALONG TO SICK BAY?

97
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:26,303
NO, MR. SCOTT.
YOU STAY AT YOUR POST,
FOR THE MOMENT.

98
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,637
LIEUTENANT UHURA.
CAPTAIN, I--

99
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,638
YES, SIR?

100
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,348
DAMAGE REPORT.

101
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,350
ALL STATIONS
ARE OPERATIVE, SIR.

102
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,684
MR. SPOCK.

103
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,311
SOME EQUIPMENT
WAS TEMPORARILY
OUT OF ORDER.

104
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,313
MY SENSORS
WERE INOPERATIVE.

105
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,981
ANY DAMAGE
TO THE WARP ENGINES?

106
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,566
NONE, CAPTAIN.

107
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,610
GOOD.
FROM THE ACTION
OF THAT...STORM,

108
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,905
WE'LL NEED
ALL THE SPEED
WE CAN GET.

109
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,407
CAPTAIN,
IT WAS NOT A STORM.

110
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,617
Uhura: CAPTAIN.

111
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,956
DURING THE DISTURBANCE,
MEMORY ALPHA WAS HAILING.

112
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:58,043
I WANTED TO RESPOND,
BUT I COULDN'T MAKE
MY HAND MOVE.

113
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,838
Chekov: CAPTAIN.

114
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,422
IT WAS NOT HANDS
THAT WERE PARALYZED.

115
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,758
IT WAS EYES.

116
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,051
I COULD NOT FORCE
MY EYES TO LOOK DOWN

117
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,177
AND SET A NEW COURSE.

118
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,929
Sulu: NO, NO.
IT WAS SPEECH
THAT WAS AFFECTED.

119
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,680
I COULDN'T UTTER
A SOUND.

120
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,147
MR. SPOCK...
EXPLANATION.

121
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,441
ONLY OF THE RESULT,
NOT OF THE CAUSE.

122
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,819
IN EACH CASE,
A DIFFERENT AREA OF
THE BRAIN WAS AFFECTED.

123
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,240
OUR VOLUNTARY NERVE
FUNCTIONS WERE UNDER
SOME FORM OF PRESSURE.

124
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,618
OR ATTACK.

125
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,621
ATTACK MIGHT BE
A MORE PRECISE
FORMULATION, CAPTAIN.

126
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,755
AND LIEUTENANT ROMAINE
SEEMS MOST SUSCEPTIBLE.

127
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,855
ARE THE READINGS
CORRESPONDING, NURSE?

128
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,565
EVERYTHING APPEARS
NORMAL, DOCTOR.

129
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,524
THANK YOU.

130
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,536
WHAT'S THAT
YOU'RE DOING, NURSE?

131
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,081
RECORDING YOUR RESPONSES
IN THIS COMPUTER.

132
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,500
BUT WHY? I HAVEN'T HAD
A SINGLE RESPONSE WORTH NOTING.

133
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,001
LIEUTENANT, PLEASE.

134
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,837
WELL, HAVE I?

135
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,799
LIEUTENANT,
THERE ARE 430 PEOPLE
ABOARD THIS SHIP.

136
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,677
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT PASSED OUT,
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHY.

137
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,387
I WANT TO KNOW WHY, TOO.

138
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,222
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR.
YOU TELL ME.

139
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,974
THIS WHOLE THING IS
A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME.

140
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,935
THIS WHOLE THING
IS A NEW EXPERIENCE
FOR ALL OF US.

141
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,728
ALL OF YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED
TO NEW EXPERIENCES.

142
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,773
IT'S PART OF YOUR WORK.

143
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,525
I'M NOT.

144
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,819
SHE MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHING THERE,
DR. McCOY.

145
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,488
THIS IS HER FIRST
DEEP-SPACE TRIP,

146
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,114
AND YOU KNOW HOW
THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE.

147
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,907
WELL, IF WE CAN GET ON
WITH THIS, SCOTTY,

148
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,534
WE MIGHT MAKE
THAT DETERMINATION.

149
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,164
NOW, THEN, TELL ME,

150
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,167
WHAT DID YOU FEEL
BEFORE YOU PASSED OUT?

151
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,293
NOTHING.

152
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,752
NOTHING?

153
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,006
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

154
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:08,673
LIEUTENANT--

155
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,718
DOCTOR, THERE IS NOTHING
MORE I CAN TELL YOU.

156
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,054
LIEUTENANT,
YOU'RE BEING COMPLETELY
UNCOOPERATIVE!

157
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,515
ARE YOU PUTTING THAT
INTO MY RECORD?
IT'S NOT TRUE!

158
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,267
I'LL PUT THE FACTS
INTO YOUR RECORD
IF I CAN GET THEM.

159
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,230
AW, NOW, MIRA,

160
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,190
WE MUST HELP
THE DOCTOR.

161
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,649
TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED.

162
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,739
PERHAPS YOU
CAN EXPLAIN TO HER

163
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,949
THAT ANY CAREER SHE
HOPES FOR IN STARFLEET

164
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,953
REQUIRES DISCIPLINE
AND COOPERATION.

165
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,206
WELL, I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT
THE LIEUTENANT WANTS.

166
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,000
SHE JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

167
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,460
DID YOU, NOW, LASS?

168
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,341
WITH A BEDSIDE MANNER
LIKE THAT, SCOTTY,

169
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,301
YOU'RE IN
THE WRONG BUSINESS.

170
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,849
WHEN THE RECORD
OF THIS IS FORWARDED,

171
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,268
I'LL BE SENT BACK,
WON'T I?

172
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,396
OH, YOU WILL NOT!
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

173
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,189
THIS GETTING USED
TO SPACE TRAVEL,

174
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,857
THAT TAKES SOME DOING.

175
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,359
AND NOT EVERYBODY
TAKES TO IT.

176
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,152
DID YOU?

177
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,321
WELL, ME,
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

178
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,156
I WAS PRACTICALLY
BORN TO IT.

179
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,076
I WANT TO CONTINUE.

180
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,660
YOU WILL.

181
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,288
YOU PASSED
YOUR STARFLEET

182
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:25,625
PRELIMINARY
EXAMINATIONS.

183
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,835
AND THIS IS
JUST GETTING USED

184
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,713
TO WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL
YOUR SPACE LEGS.

185
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,845
I HOPE THAT'S
ALL IT IS.

186
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,515
CAPTAIN, I'VE PLOTTED
THE STORM'S PATH.

187
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,016
MR. LEMLI.

188
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,229
MAIN SCREEN
PROJECTION.

189
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,150
Sulu: ON
ITS PRESENT COURSE,

190
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,236
IT WILL HIT THE MEMORY ALPHA
PLANETOID AS IT DID US.

191
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,530
LIEUTENANT, TRY
AND WARN MEMORY ALPHA

192
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,240
OF THE PROXIMITY
OF THAT PHENOMENON.

193
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,326
GIVE ME AN E.T.A.
FOR ITS POSSIBLE IMPACT.

194
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:03,037
I CANNOT, SIR.
IT HAS THE ABILITY
TO CHANGE SPEED.

195
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,624
SIR, I'M UNABLE TO ESTABLISH
CONTACT WITH THE PLANETOID.

196
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,543
I'M HAILING ON ALL
FREQUENCIES. NO RESPONSE.

197
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,670
IT IS OF LITTLE
CONSEQUENCE, CAPTAIN.

198
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,256
MEMORY ALPHA HAS
NO PROTECTIVE SHIELDS.

199
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,466
NO SHIELDS?

200
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,674
NONE, CAPTAIN.

201
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,760
WHEN THE LIBRARY COMPLEX
WAS ASSEMBLED,

202
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,387
SHIELDING WAS
CONSIDERED INAPPROPRIATE

203
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,473
TO ITS TOTALLY
ACADEMIC PURPOSE.

204
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,183
SINCE THE INFORMATION
ON THE MEMORY PLANET

205
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,185
IS FREELY AVAILABLE
TO EVERYONE,

206
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,728
SPECIAL PROTECTION
WAS DEEMED UNNECESSARY.

207
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,439
WONDERFUL.

208
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,108
I HOPE THE STORM IS AWARE
OF THAT RATIONALE.

209
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,152
COMPLETING APPROACH
TO PLANETOID.

210
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,488
IT IS ALREADY OVER
MEMORY ALPHA,
CAPTAIN.

211
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,281
ITS SPEED
IS INCREDIBLE.

212
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,616
IT'S HITTING
THE PLANETOID.

213
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,621
Kirk: ARE WE WITHIN
ORBIT RANGE, MR. CHEKOV?

214
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,122
MAKING FINAL APPROACH.

215
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,582
LIEUTENANT,
TRY AND WARN THEM--

216
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,126
I'M SORRY, SIR.
I CAN'T BREAK THROUGH
THIS INTERFERENCE.

217
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:02,096
MR. SPOCK,
HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE ON MEMORY ALPHA?

218
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,141
IT VARIES WITH THE NUMBER
OF SCHOLARS, RESEARCHERS,
AND SCIENTISTS

219
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,767
FROM VARIOUS
FEDERATION PLANETS

220
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,895
WHO ARE USING
THE COMPUTER COMPLEX.

221
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,523
Chekov: CAPTAIN,
WE ARE WITHIN
ORBIT RANGE.

222
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,778
LOCK INTO ORBIT.

223
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,655
Chekov:
AYE, SIR.

224
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,157
Sulu: IT IS LEAVING
MEMORY ALPHA,
CAPTAIN.

225
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,159
Spock: SENSORS GIVE NO READINGS
OF GENERATED ENERGY

226
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,994
FROM MEMORY ALPHA,
CAPTAIN.

227
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,787
ANY LIFE READINGS?

228
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,664
NONE.

229
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,338
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT'S
GOING ON DOWN THERE.

230
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,968
KIRK TO ENGINEERING.
MR. SCOTT, REPORT.

231
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,971
KIRK TO ENGINEERING.
MR. SCOTT!

232
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,890
WHERE THE DEVIL IS HE?

233
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,436
SCOTTY, REPORT TO THE BRIDGE.
REPORT TO THE BRIDGE.

234
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,187
HAVE THE TRANSPORTER ROOM
STAND BY.

235
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,564
I'M TAKING A LANDING PARTY
DOWN THERE.

236
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,022
Uhura:
AYE, AYE, SIR.

237
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,692
SCOTT HERE.

238
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,944
SCOTTY,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
WHERE ARE YOU?

239
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,320
IN THE SICK BAY.

240
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,488
ARE YOU SICK?

241
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:04,701
OH, NO. I WAS JUST
CHECKING ON THE LASS.

242
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,452
SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE NOW.

243
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,911
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH HER.

244
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,039
WELL, I'M RELIEVED TO HEAR
YOUR PROGNOSIS, MR. SCOTT.

245
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,709
IS THE DOCTOR THERE
WITH YOU, OR WILL I
FIND HIM IN ENGINEERING?

246
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,380
McCOY HERE, JIM.

247
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,757
DOCTOR,
HOW'S THE GIRL?

248
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,341
I THINK
SHE'S IN GOOD SHAPE.

249
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,094
Kirk: WELL, MR. SCOTT
SEEMS TO AGREE WITH YOU.

250
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,095
THE TWO OF YOU
MEET ME

251
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,013
IN THE TRANSPORTER
ROOM ON THE DOUBLE.

252
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,411
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
SUPPLEMENTAL,

253
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:52,039
STARDATE 5725.6--

254
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,292
THE STORM HAS CLEARED
MEMORY ALPHA.

255
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,295
IT IS HEADING AWAY
AT INCREDIBLE SPEED.

256
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,548
WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE
CONTACT WITH THE PLANETOID.

257
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,468
ITS SILENCE IS OMINOUS.

258
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,928
WE ARE BEAMING DOWN
TO INVESTIGATE.

259
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,182
SOMEHOW I FIND

260
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,601
TRANSPORTING
INTO THE DARKNESS
UNNERVING.

261
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,602
SCOTTY, CAN YOU
GIVE US SOME MORE LIGHT?

262
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,489
I'M AFRAID THIS LIGHT
WILL HAVE TO DO, CAPTAIN.

263
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,157
THE GENERATOR
IS INOPERATIVE.

264
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,034
DAMAGE REPORT,
SPOCK.

265
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,828
A DISASTER FOR
THE GALAXY, CAPTAIN.

266
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,162
THE CENTRAL BRAIN
IS DAMAGED.

267
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,497
THE MEMORY CORE
IS BURNT OUT.

268
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,124
THE LOSS TO THE GALAXY
MAY BE IRRETRIEVABLE.

269
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,877
CAPTAIN!

270
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,862
A VERY FAINT
LIFE READING

271
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,697
IN THE IMMEDIATE
VICINITY, CAPTAIN.

272
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,656
LOCATE THEM.
KEEP THEM ALIVE.

273
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,367
WE NEED MORE INFORMATION
ABOUT THIS ENEMY.

274
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,621
OVER HERE, CAPTAIN.

275
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,588
[LOW-PITCHED CROAKING]

276
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,343
BONES, CAN YOU
DO SOMETHING?

277
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,553
NOT A THING, JIM.

278
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,809
[CROAKING]

279
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,187
IT'S THE SAME
GARBLED SOUNDS
LIEUTENANT ROMAINE MADE

280
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,647
WHEN SHE FAINTED
AFTER THE STORM.

281
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,648
ARE YOU SURE?

282
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,066
ABSOLUTELY SURE.

283
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:44,944
KIRK TO
"ENTERPRISE."

284
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:45,612
SULU HERE.

285
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,864
BEAM DOWN
LIEUTENANT ROMAINE
IMMEDIATELY.

286
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,073
YES, SIR.

287
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,577
[CROAKING]

288
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,461
SPOCK...

289
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,879
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE
THAT BEFORE?

290
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:03,880
NEGATIVE.

291
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,633
[CROAKING]

292
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,805
[SILENT]

293
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,890
BONES?

294
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,767
SHE'S DEAD.

295
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,602
WHAT DID SHE
DIE OF?

296
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,103
SEVERE BRAIN HEMORRHAGING

297
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,731
DUE TO DISTORTION OF
ALL NEURAL SYSTEMS,

298
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,567
DISSOLUTION OF AUTONOMIC
NERVOUS SYSTEM,

299
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,361
ALL BASIC PERSONALITY
FACTORS, CAPTAIN.

300
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,239
THE ATTACK
WAS THOROUGH.

301
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,158
WHAT DID THE OTHERS
DIE OF?

302
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,952
EACH HAD A DIFFERENT
CENTER OF BRAIN DESTROYED,

303
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,745
CAUSE UNKNOWN.

304
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,498
A DIFFERENT CENTER
OF THE BRAIN, YOU SAY?

305
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,292
YES, CAPTAIN.
I CAN BE MORE DETAILED

306
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,544
WHEN WE RETURN TO THE SHIP
AND USE THE SHIP'S COMPUTERS.

307
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,927
Scotty: MIRA!

308
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,263
THE CAPTAIN
HAS SOME QUESTIONS.

309
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,517
YES, CAPTAIN?

310
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,979
LIEUTENANT, WHEN YOU
WERE UNCONSCIOUS,
YOU WERE...SPEAKING.

311
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,856
WHAT DID I SAY?

312
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,232
I DON'T KNOW.
THE WORDS WERE
UNFAMILIAR TO ME.

313
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,985
WHAT DID IT
SOUND LIKE?

314
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,277
THEY SOUNDED
EXACTLY LIKE

315
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,988
THE LAST WORDS SPOKEN
BY THE TECHNICIAN.

316
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,072
WHAT TECHNICIAN?

317
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,492
WE FOUND ONE PERSON IN THERE
JUST BARELY ALIVE.

318
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,036
THE REST WERE DEAD,
AND WE--

319
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,245
LIEUTENANT.

320
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,172
LIEUTENANT.

321
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,008
WE MUST GET BACK
TO THE SHIP!

322
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,343
WHY? TELL ME WHY.

323
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,137
THAT STORM--
IT'S RETURNING.

324
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,305
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

325
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,392
I KNOW.
YOU'LL BE KILLED IF WE STAY.

326
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,561
Spock: LIEUTENANT,
I ASSURE YOU,

327
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,647
THAT UNEXPLAINED
PHENOMENON WAS HEADED
AWAY FROM THE PLANET.

328
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,607
IT IS PROBABLY SEEKING
OTHER VICTIMS.

329
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,442
I TELL YOU,
IT WILL KILL US.

330
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,450
"ENTERPRISE" TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

331
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,202
KIRK HERE.
Sulu: BRIDGE, SIR.

332
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,539
THE STORM HAS REAPPEARED
ON THE LONG-RANGE SCANNER
AND IS CLOSING FAST.

333
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,169
WHAT'S ITS COURSE?

334
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,755
COMING BACK
IN THIS DIRECTION.

335
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,675
BEAM US UP.

336
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,187
MR. SULU, THIS IS
THE CAPTAIN.

337
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,564
GET THE "ENTERPRISE"
OUT OF HERE.

338
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,274
WAIT, CAPTAIN!
WE'VE LOST MIRA.

339
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,736
BELAY THAT ORDER,
MR. SULU.

340
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,195
STABILIZER.

341
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,530
SOMETHING'S INTERFERING WITH
THE TRANSPORTER SIGNAL.

342
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,824
I HAVE HER COORDINATES,
BUT SHE'S SUSPENDED IN TRANSIT.

343
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,534
LET ME.

344
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,853
Kirk: ALL RIGHT, MR. SULU,
GET US OUT OF HERE.

345
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,856
MR. SCOTT, CHECK
EMERGENCY MANUAL MONITOR
FOR TRANSPORTER CONTROL.

346
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,248
CAPTAIN, IT'S
CHANGING COURSE.

347
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,002
PLOT THE NEW COURSE,
MR. CHEKOV.

348
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,420
PRESENT COURSE
IS 126 MARK 20.

349
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,296
PLOT IT.

350
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,923
PRESENT COURSE
WILL BRING IT

351
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,258
ACROSS OUR STARBOARD
SIDE, SIR.

352
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,927
MR. SPOCK, YOU MADE
A STATEMENT

353
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,805
THAT PHENOMENON
IS NOT A STORM.

354
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,306
EXPLAIN IT.

355
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,891
NO KNOWN CONDITIONS IN SPACE

356
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,977
WOULD SUPPORT THAT TYPE
OF NATURAL PHENOMENON.

357
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:46,811
WHAT IS IT?

358
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:47,937
CAPTAIN, I'M
HAVING DIFFICULTY

359
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:48,980
WITH THE SHIP'S SENSORS.

360
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,774
THEY SEEM TO BE
UNDER SELECTIVE ATTACK
BY THE PHENOMENON

361
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,153
AS THE UNFORTUNATE OCCUPANTS
OF MEMORY ALPHA WERE.

362
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,322
THEN DEDUCTIVE
REASONING WILL HAVE
TO BE SUBSTITUTED.

363
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,117
Spock: SHIP'S SENSORS ARE
OPERATING AT THE MOMENT.

364
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,954
PERHAPS THE ELUSIVE
CREATURE WILL NOW REVEAL
SOMETHING ABOUT ITSELF.

365
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,247
BUT I SAW
THOSE MEN DEAD...

366
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,333
IN THEIR EXACT
POSITIONS.

367
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,377
LISTEN TO ME.

368
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,295
I'VE TOLD YOU
WHAT STRANGE TRICKS

369
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,173
A SPACE TRIP CAN
PLAY ON YOUR MIND.

370
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,008
NOW, THAT'S ALL IT IS.

371
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,843
NO, SCOTTY.

372
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,806
HAVE YOU EVER HAD VISIONS
OF THE FUTURE EVENTS
BEFORE THIS?

373
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,558
NEVER.

374
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,894
WELL, IF YOU ASK ME,
NOBODY EVER HAS.

375
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,188
THAT SEEING OF THE FUTURE--
IT'S PURE BUNK.

376
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,857
YOU KNOW THAT,
DON'T YOU?

377
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,150
I'VE ALWAYS
BELIEVED IT.

378
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,860
AND YOU WERE
PERFECTLY RIGHT.

379
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,989
THEN WHAT IS IT, SCOTTY?

380
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,281
WHAT'S FRIGHTENING ME?

381
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,534
EVER SINCE THAT...
THAT STORM HIT,

382
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,411
I'VE...I'VE HAD
SUCH STRANGE THOUGHTS,

383
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:49,123
SUCH FEELINGS OF...
OF TERROR.

384
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,709
SPACE.

385
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,004
SPACE--
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

386
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,967
THEN I DON'T HAVE
TO REPORT IT?

387
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,512
IF YOU WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF THE TRIP
IN SICK BAY.

388
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,764
BUT WHAT GOOD
WOULD THAT DO?

389
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,975
DR. McCOY CAN
NO MORE CURE IT
THAN HE CAN A COLD.

390
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,027
CAPTAIN, IT'S HEADING
STRAIGHT FOR US.

391
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,612
ACTIVATE SHIELDS.

392
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,530
SHIELDS ACTIVATED.

393
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,825
MR. CHEKOV, CHANGE COURSE
TO ONE 4 3 MARK 3

394
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,744
ONE 4 3 MARK 3.

395
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,788
STORM'S COURSE, MR. SULU?

396
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,539
ONE 4 3 MARK 3.

397
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,209
TAKE EVASIVE ACTION.

398
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,586
Sulu:
EVASIVE ACTION.

399
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,506
HARD STARBOARD,
2 ONE 7 MARK 5.

400
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,592
2 ONE 7 MARK 5.

401
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,776
Sulu: STILL
WITH US, SIR.

402
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,861
HARD PORT.

403
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,490
117 MARK 2.

404
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,700
117 MARK 2.

405
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,580
Sulu:
STILL WITH US, SIR.

406
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,835
IS IT CLOSING?

407
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,378
Spock: NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.
MAINTAINING ITS DISTANCE.

408
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,799
HOWEVER, IT IS MATCHING
EACH MANEUVER WE EXECUTE,

409
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:25,970
AND I AM RECEIVING INCREASING
MAGNITUDE OF ENERGY.

410
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,912
YOUR ANALYSIS, SPOCK.

411
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,206
WHAT IS IT?

412
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,208
NOT WHAT IS "IT,"
CAPTAIN.

413
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,625
WHAT ARE "THEY"?

414
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,463
THERE ARE 10 DISTINCT
LIFE UNITS WITHIN IT,

415
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,799
ALL POWERFULLY ALIVE
AND VITAL.

416
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,095
Kirk: WHO ARE THEY?
WHERE ARE THEY FROM?

417
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,348
IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE
WITHOUT PROGRAMMING

418
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,557
FOR COMPUTER ANALYSIS.

419
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:12,975
IT'S CLEAR WE CAN'T
OUTRUN THEM.

420
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,352
CAN WE SHIELD
AGAINST THEM?

421
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,145
I DO NOT BELIEVE
THE "ENTERPRISE" SHIELDS

422
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,521
WOULD PROVE
AN EFFECTIVE DEFENSE.

423
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,149
THERE MUST BE SOME
DEFENSE WE CAN USE.

424
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:23,194
CAPTAIN, WE ARE DEALING
WITH A COMMUNITY
OF LIFE UNITS.

425
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,905
THEIR ATTACK IS IN
THE FORM OF BRAIN WAVES

426
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,325
DIRECTED AGAINST
THE BRAIN WHICH IS
MOST COMPATIBLE.

427
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,327
MAYBE WE CAN AVOID
ANOTHER ATTACK.

428
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,411
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
OPEN ALL CHANNELS,

429
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,539
TIE IN THE UNIVERSAL
TRANSLATOR.

430
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,666
MR. SPOCK SAYS IT'S ALIVE.

431
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,962
MAYBE I CAN TALK TO IT.

432
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,506
Uhura: ALL CHANNELS OPEN,
TRANSLATOR TIED IN.

433
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,888
THIS IS CAPTAIN
JAMES KIRK

434
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,224
OF THE U.S.S.
"ENTERPRISE."

435
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,808
WE WISH YOU
NO HARM.

436
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:09,990
PHYSICAL CONTACT
BETWEEN US

437
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,617
IS FATAL TO
OUR LIFE FORMS.

438
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:15,162
PLEASE, DO NOT
COME ANY CLOSER
TO OUR SHIP.

439
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,627
PERHAPS IT DID NOT
UNDERSTAND.

440
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,671
Sulu: CAPTAIN,
CHANGE IN VELOCITY
RECORDED.

441
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,884
Sulu: THEY
ARE PASSING
OUR STARBOARD SIDE

442
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,386
AND MANEUVERING
IN FRONT OF US.

443
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,554
SWITCHING
TO FORWARD SCANNER.

444
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,525
CAPTAIN, CHANGE
IN VELOCITY RECORDED.

445
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,569
IT HAS ACCELERATED
ITS APPROACH.

446
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,328
HELP, SCOTTY.

447
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,621
HELP. HOLD ME!

448
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,081
IT'S HAPPENING
AGAIN!

449
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,257
NO!

450
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,716
MIRA.

451
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:16,849
PERHAPS IT
UNDERSTANDS ANOTHER
KIND OF LANGUAGE.

452
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:17,850
CONDITION RED ALERT.

453
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,268
[ALARM SOUNDING]

454
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,103
PREPARE FOR
PHASER FIRING.

455
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,981
MIRA.

456
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,442
NO, SCOTTY! NO!

457
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,319
NO.

458
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:31,030
Kirk: LOCK IN PHASER
TRACKING CONTROLS.

459
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,531
LOCKED IN, SIR.

460
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,452
ADJUST PHASERS TO FIRE
ACROSS ITS COURSE.

461
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,911
DO NOT HIT IT.

462
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,580
LOCKED IN, SIR.

463
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,539
FIRE.

464
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,842
REACTION, MR. SULU?

465
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,302
NONE, SIR.

466
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,054
THEY'RE STILL
APPROACHING US.

467
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,606
APPARENTLY A SHOT
ACROSS THE BOW ISN'T
SUFFICIENTLY CONVINCING.

468
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,447
PREPARE TO LOCK PHASERS
INTO THE HEART OF
THE COMMUNITY.

469
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,119
LOCKED IN, SIR.

470
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,329
FIRE.

471
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,831
SCOTTY!

472
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,750
OH!

473
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,211
MIRA!

474
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,628
MIRA.

475
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,172
Sulu: THE PHASERS
SEEM TO HAVE STOPPED
THEIR APPROACH.

476
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,590
THEY'RE HOLDING POSITION.

477
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,510
LOCK IN FOR
ANOTHER BLAST.

478
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,220
LOCKED IN, SIR.

479
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,471
Scotty: CAPTAIN!

480
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,936
CAPTAIN, THE PHASER SHOTS--
THEY'RE KILLING MIRA!

481
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,563
KILLING
LIEUTENANT ROMAINE?

482
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,772
AYE. WHEN YOU
FIRED THE PHASERS,

483
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,148
THEY STUNNED HER
AND SHE CRUMPLED.

484
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,900
ANOTHER SHOT
AND YOU'LL KILL HER!

485
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,529
GET HER TO SICK BAY
AT ONCE.

486
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,533
READY FOR FIRING,
CAPTAIN.

487
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,662
CANCEL THAT ORDER.

488
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,340
ANOTHER ATTACK
ON THAT ALIEN LIFE FORM

489
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,967
WILL KILL
LIEUTENANT ROMAINE.

490
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,385
IT APPEARS SO.

491
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,678
IF SHE IS TO SURVIVE,
WE CAN'T ATTACK.

492
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,055
NOT DIRECTLY.

493
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,932
CAN THE COMPUTER
SUPPLY A DEFENSE

494
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,476
BASED ON ALL
THE DATA YOU'VE
BEEN ACCUMULATING?

495
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:24,768
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.

496
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,645
I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GATHER
SUFFICIENT DATA FOR THAT.

497
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,400
CAPTAIN, THERE IS ONLY
ONE POSSIBLE DEFENSE--

498
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,319
IF WE CAN FIND
AN ENVIRONMENT

499
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,695
WHICH IS DEADLY
TO THE ALIEN FORM.

500
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,782
AND YET ISOLATE
THE GIRL FROM
ITS DEADLY EFFECTS.

501
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,706
CAPTAIN KIRK
TO DR. McCOY.

502
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,000
McCoy: YES, CAPTAIN?

503
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,169
IS THE GIRL
WELL ENOUGH
TO BE QUESTIONED?

504
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,045
I CAN HAVE HER READY
IN A FEW MINUTES.

505
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,881
HAVE THE LIEUTENANT
AND MR. SCOTT

506
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,800
IN THE BRIEFING ROOM
AS QUICKLY
AS POSSIBLE.

507
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,095
BRING ALL AVAILABLE
BIOGRAPHICAL MATERIAL
WITH YOU.

508
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,598
KIRK OUT.
MR. SPOCK, COME WITH ME.

509
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,944
GO EASY ON HER, JIM.
SHE'S IN A PRETTY BAD STATE.

510
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,821
I'LL TRY.

511
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,575
LIEUTENANT ROMAINE.

512
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,380
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE
UNCOOPERATIVE, DOCTOR.

513
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,298
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.
I TOLD THE CAPTAIN.

514
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,592
WE MUST
GET TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT IS HAPPENING.

515
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,969
I'LL TELL YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

516
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,890
SHIP'S INVESTIGATIVE
PROCEDURES ARE
SOMETIMES CONFUSING

517
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:45,807
TO A NEW CREWMAN.

518
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,726
DON'T LET US
UPSET YOU.

519
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,395
I TRUST ALL OF YOU
IMPLICITLY.

520
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,107
I WANT TO HELP.

521
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,568
Kirk: THIS
INVESTIGATION

522
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,653
HAS BEEN PROMPTED
BY 2 EVENTS.

523
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,113
FIRST IS THE TIME
YOU PASSED OUT
ON THE BRIDGE,

524
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,241
AND THE SECOND
IS WHEN WE FIRED

525
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,284
OUR MAIN PHASERS
INTO THAT FORCE
THAT IS ATTACKING US

526
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,412
AND SERIOUSLY
INJURED YOU.

527
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,955
YOU MUSTN'T WORRY
ABOUT HURTING ME.

528
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,667
NOW, THIS IS
HOW WE'LL PROCEED.

529
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:15,837
MR. SPOCK HAS ALL
THE INFORMATION
AVAILABLE TO US

530
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,964
ABOUT OUR ATTACKERS.

531
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,841
DR. McCOY HAS ACCESS

532
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,595
TO STARFLEET'S
EXHAUSTIVE FILES ON YOU.

533
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,596
A COMPARISON
OF THE TWO

534
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,598
MAY TURN UP
SOME IMPROBABLE CONNECTION

535
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:29,184
WHICH MAY PROTECT YOU
AND OURSELVES.

536
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,395
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN?

537
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,313
DR. MCCOY,
WILL YOU PROCEED?

538
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,071
ROMAINE, MIRA.
LIEUTENANT.

539
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,699
PLACE OF BIRTH,
MARTIAN COLONY NUMBER 3.

540
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,992
PARENTS, LYDIA ROMAINE,
DECEASED.

541
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,703
JACQUES ROMAINE,
CHIEF ENGINEER,

542
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,789
STARFLEET, RETIRED.

543
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,541
MR. SPOCK, ARE YOU PREPARED
WITH THE BACKGROUND HISTORY

544
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,792
OF THE ATTACKERS?

545
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,460
I AM, CAPTAIN.

546
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,503
I HAVE FED
ALL OBTAINABLE DATA

547
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:57,546
TO THE MAIN COMPUTER.

548
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,880
IT SHOULD BE
READY TO SUPPLY

549
00:29:59,005 --> 00:29:59,965
WHATEVER CONCLUSIONS
ARE POSSIBLE.

550
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,468
THANK YOU.

551
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:03,761
MR. SULU,
WHAT IS THE STATUS

552
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,095
OF OUR FRIENDS
UP THERE?

553
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,388
STATUS UNCHANGED.

554
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,474
THEY ARE STILL WITH US
AND KEEPING THE SAME DISTANCE.

555
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,225
CONTINUE EVASIVE
MANEUVERS.

556
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:10,892
KEEP ME INFORMED.

557
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,186
KIRK OUT.

558
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,314
DOCTOR, YOU HAVE
A MEDICAL RECORD

559
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,232
OF LIEUTENANT ROMAINE
AVAILABLE?

560
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,525
YES, CAPTAIN.

561
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,736
I'D LIKE A FEW ITEMS
FROM HER PSYCHOLOGICAL

562
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,612
PROFILE CHECKED.

563
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,494
ANY HISTORY OF
PSYCHOSOMATIC ILLNESS?

564
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,416
OCCASIONAL AND TEENAGE
ROUTINE INCIDENTS.

565
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,794
ANY EVIDENCE
OF INVOLUNTARY
OR UNCONSCIOUS

566
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,211
TELEPATHIC ABILITIES?

567
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,133
NONE.

568
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,595
ANY PATHOLOGICAL
OR UNUSUAL

569
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,221
EMPATHIC RESPONSES?

570
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,934
NO, CAPTAIN,
NOT EMPATHIC.

571
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,729
HOWEVER, AN EXTREMELY
FLEXIBLE

572
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,398
AND PLIANT RESPONSE TO NEW
LEARNING SITUATIONS

573
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,608
IS HIGHLY MARKED.

574
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,027
GO AHEAD, DOCTOR.

575
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,654
RIGHT AFTER OUR PHASERS
HIT THAT THING,

576
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,824
I GAVE LIEUTENANT ROMAINE
A STANDARD STEINMAN ANALYSIS,

577
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,200
AND THE RESULTS
MIGHT BE INTERESTING.

578
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,409
UH-HUH. GO AHEAD.

579
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,708
A COMPARISON OF OUR STEINMAN
WITH STARFLEET RECORDS

580
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:20,170
SHOWS THAT LIEUTENANT ROMAINE'S
FINGERPRINTS, VOICE ANALYSIS,

581
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:24,257
ALL EXTERNAL FACTORS REMAIN
EXACTLY THE SAME AS BEFORE.

582
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,636
HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO
2 HYPERENCEPHALOGRAMS,

583
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,888
HER BRAIN WAVE PATTERN
HAS BEEN ALTERED.

584
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,852
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

585
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,812
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS TAUGHT.

586
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,648
BUT THE BCP IS JUST AS
CONSISTENT AS FINGERPRINTS.

587
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,607
LET'S SEE IT.

588
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,950
DR. McCOY, ACCORDING
TO YOUR RECORDS,

589
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,830
LIEUTENANT ROMAINE
HAS SHOWED NO ABNORMAL
TELEPATHIC POWERS.

590
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,498
McCoy:
THAT'S RIGHT, SPOCK,

591
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,877
BUT EXCEPTIONAL PLIANCY
WAS INDICATED.

592
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,003
THAT MIGHT BE A FACTOR.

593
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,505
Spock:
AND YOU ARE SURE

594
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,632
THAT THIS IS
THE CORRECT SLIDE?

595
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:09,511
YES, MR. SPOCK.
THAT IS TAPE DECK "D"--

596
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,389
BRAIN CIRCUITRY PATTERN
OF LIEUTENANT MIRA ROMAINE.

597
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:15,350
GENTLEMEN,
IT ALSO
HAPPENS TO BE

598
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,144
TAPE "H"--
THE IMPULSE
TRACKING

599
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,231
OBTAINED
FROM THE ALIEN
LIFE UNITS.

600
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,400
McCoy: NURSE CHAPEL
FOLLOWED THIS EVERY
STEP OF THE WAY.

601
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,860
THERE CAN BE NO ERROR.

602
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,069
CHECK IT, SPOCK.

603
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,663
AS I SAID, CAPTAIN,
THIS IS THE TRACKING

604
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,791
OBTAINED DURING
THE LAST SHIELDED RUN.

605
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,297
COMPUTER,
RUN A DETAILED
COMPARISON--

606
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,048
BRAIN CIRCUITRY
PATTERNS,

607
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:50,051
TAPE "D"
AND TAPE "H."

608
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,136
Computer voice:
COMPARISON--

609
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,973
TAPE "D," BRAIN CIRCUITRY
PATTERNS OF LIEUTENANT
MIRA ROMAINE

610
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,769
AND TAPE "H," BRAIN CIRCUITRY
PATTERNS OF ALIEN LIFE UNIT

611
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,312
IDENTICAL.

612
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,688
IDENTICAL.

613
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,151
FASCINATING.

614
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,405
THERE HAS BEEN NO ERROR.

615
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,241
DR. McCOY
IS CORRECT, CAPTAIN.

616
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,452
THERE IS AN IDENTITY
OF MINDS TAKING PLACE

617
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:19,623
BETWEEN THE ALIEN
BEINGS AND THE MIND
OF LIEUTENANT ROMAINE.

618
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,917
THEIR THOUGHTS...

619
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,627
ARE BECOMING HERS.

620
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,594
BRIDGE TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

621
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,013
THE ALIEN IS
NO LONGER MAINTAINING
ITS DISTANCE.

622
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,349
CONTINUE EVASIVE ACTION.
KEEP ME INFORMED.
KIRK OUT.

623
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,401
MIRA HAS TRIED TO TELL ME
ALL ALONG

624
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,488
THAT SHE WAS SEEING THINGS
IN ADVANCE.

625
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,657
WHY DIDN'T YOU
REPORT IT?

626
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:54,867
YOU DON'T REPORT
SPACE SICKNESS.

627
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,703
THAT'S ALL
I THOUGHT IT WAS.

628
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,037
WHAT DID SHE SEE?

629
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,165
FIRST THE ATTACK
ON THE SHIP,

630
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,418
THE ATTACK
ON MEMORY ALPHA,

631
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,881
AND...THE TIME
WE NEARLY LOST HER.

632
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,843
THOSE WERE ALL
ACTS CARRIED OUT
BY OUR ATTACKER.

633
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,636
AND...

634
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:22,060
AND...

635
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,063
YES, SCOTTY?

636
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,026
WHAT ELSE?

637
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,863
I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT

638
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:33,906
THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE,

639
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:37,200
BUT...I GUESS
I WAS WRONG.

640
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,994
WAS HE WRONG,
LIEUTENANT?

641
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,413
YES, THERE WAS
ONE OTHER TIME.

642
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:42,956
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

643
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,666
I SAW SCOTTY.

644
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,002
WHERE?

645
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,879
I DON'T KNOW.

646
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,088
WHAT WAS HE DOING?

647
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,639
HE WAS DYING.

648
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,939
NOW I UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S BEEN
HAPPENING.

649
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,027
I'VE BEEN SEEING
THROUGH...

650
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,404
THROUGH ANOTHER MIND.

651
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,699
I'VE BEEN FLOODED
WITH THOUGHTS...

652
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,576
NOT MY OWN.

653
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,536
THEY CONTROL ME!
OH, SCOTTY.

654
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,622
SCOTTY,
I'D RATHER DIE
THAN HURT YOU!

655
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,040
I'D RATHER DIE.

656
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,709
ALL RIGHT, NOW.

657
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:32,505
WHAT'S ALL THIS TALK
OF DYING?

658
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:36,885
THEY'VE CALLED THE TURN ON US
3 OUT OF 4 TIMES.

659
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,806
NOW, THAT'S A BETTER AVERAGE
THAN ANYBODY DESERVES.

660
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,933
IT'S OUR TURN NOW.

661
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,684
WE'LL FIGHT THEM.

662
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,064
SO LET'S NOT HEAR
ANYTHING MORE ABOUT DYING.

663
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,190
[SIGNAL FROM BRIDGE]

664
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,191
KIRK HERE.

665
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,234
SULU, CAPTAIN.

666
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,320
ALL EVASION TACTICS
CARRIED OUT AS ORDERED.

667
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,863
Kirk: WHAT SUCCESS
DID YOU HAVE?

668
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,449
IT'S BEEN USELESS,
CAPTAIN.

669
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,784
Spock: AT THEIR
PRESENT FORCE,

670
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,036
THEY WILL GET
THROUGH THE SHIELDS
THIS TIME, CAPTAIN.

671
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,915
WARP 8, MR. SULU.

672
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,917
YES, SIR.

673
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,418
THEY'LL BE HERE
VERY SOON.

674
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,757
THEY MAY DESTROY YOU
AND US AS THEY DID
MEMORY ALPHA.

675
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,969
YOU ARE
ESPECIALLY SUSCEPTIBLE
TO THEIR WILL.

676
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:23,140
BUT WE HAVE...
ONE CHANCE TO SURVIVE.

677
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,975
DON'T RESIST.

678
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,436
LET THEM BEGIN
TO FUNCTION THROUGH YOU.

679
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,942
IF WE CAN CONTROL
THAT MOMENT,

680
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,610
WE HAVE A CHANCE.
WILL YOU TRY?

681
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,992
TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

682
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,871
CAPTAIN KIRK
TO MEDICAL LAB.

683
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,455
MEDICAL LAB HERE, SIR.

684
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,915
PREPARE THE ANTIGRAV
TEST UNITS.

685
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,792
LET'S GO.

686
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:03,763
Sulu: ATTENTION.

687
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,473
ALL PERSONNEL,
ATTENTION.

688
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,392
ALIEN FORCE
HAS PENETRATED THE SHIP.

689
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,768
TAKE DEFENSIVE ACTION.

690
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,981
ATTENTION, ALL PERSONNEL.

691
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,691
THE ALIEN BEING
HAS PENETRATED THE SHIP.

692
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,401
TAKE DEFENSIVE ACTION.

693

GENERAL QUARTERS--

00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,782

REPEAT. GENERAL QUARTERS--
SECURITY CONDITION 3.

696
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:28,413
INTRUDER ALERT.

697
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,300
Kirk: AS SOON
AS SHE HAS ENTERED
THE GRAVITY CHAMBER,

698
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,677
SECURE ALL PORTS.

699
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,021
DON'T TOUCH ME, SCOTTY!

700
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,189
STAY AWAY.

701
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,573
[LOW-PITCHED CROAKING]

702
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,585
WE'VE LOST HER
TO THEM.

703
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,298
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

704
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,134
SHE COULD KILL US ALL
IN THIS STATE.

705
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:24,469
SHE WILL, UNLESS WE
ARE ABLE TO COMPLETE

706
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,096
WHAT THE CAPTAIN
HAS PLANNED.

707
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,098
STAY WITH US,
MIRA.

708
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,975
PLEASE STAY!

709
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,144
I'M TRYING.

710
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,399
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

711
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,693
THEY ARE TOO STRONG.

712
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,320
DON'T LOSE YOURSELF
TO THEM.

713
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,989
HOLD ON!

714
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:59,296
I AM MIRA ROMAINE.

715
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,425
I WILL BE
WHO I CHOOSE TO BE.

716
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,054
Mira: I WI--

717
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,597
STAY AWAY, SCOTTY!

718
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,768
THEY'RE WITH ME.

719
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,481
THEY WILL KILL YOU.

720
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,649
YOU WON'T
LET THEM.

721
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,580
Deep voice:
SHE CANNOT STOP US.

722
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,582
YOU CANNOT PREVENT IT.

723
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:39,836
Scotty: MIRA...

724
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,714
MIRA!

725

CAPTAIN.

726
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,591
THAT'S NOT
MIRA TALKING.

727
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,094
CAPTAIN, WE MUST
DEAL WITH THEM
DIRECTLY,

728
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,889
NOW, WHILE SHE
STILL RETAINS
PARTIAL IDENTITY.

729
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,431
WE CAN SPEAK
TO THEM.

730
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,642
THEY WILL ANSWER
USING HER VOICE.

731
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,612
I'M CAPTAIN

732
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,489
OF THE SPACESHIP
"ENTERPRISE."

733
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,661
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

734
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,748
Deep voice:
YES, WE UNDERSTAND YOU.

735
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,625
WE HAVE SEARCHED
FOR A MILLENNIUM

736
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:23,004
FOR ONE THROUGH WHOM
WE CAN SEE AND SPEAK

737
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,758
AND HEAR AND LIVE OUT
OUR LIVES.

738
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,093
WHO ARE YOU?

739
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:31,304
WE ARE FROM ZETAR.

740
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,639
THAT IS ONE OF THE PLANETS
WHERE ALL HUMANOID LIFE
WAS DESTROYED.

741
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,061
YOU CAN'T BE
FROM ZETAR.

742
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:41,480
ALL LIFE WAS
DESTROYED THERE
LONG AGO.

743
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:45,277
YES. ALL CORPOREAL LIFE
WAS DESTROYED.

744
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:46,611
THEN WHAT ARE YOU?

745
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,447
THE DESIRES,
THE HOPES, THE MIND,

746
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,492
AND THE WILL OF
THE LAST 100 OF ZETAR.

747
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,913
THE FORCE OF OUR LIFE
COULD NOT BE WIPED OUT.

748
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,831
ALL THINGS DIE.

749
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,167
AT THE PROPER TIME.

750
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,836
OUR PLANET WAS DYING.

751
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,672
WE WERE DETERMINED
TO LIVE ON.

752
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,008
AT THE PEAK
OF OUR PLANS TO GO,

753
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:12,470
A SUDDEN FINAL DISASTER
STRUCK US DOWN,

754
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:17,183
BUT THE FORCE OF
OUR LIVES SURVIVED.

755
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:22,439
AT LAST WE HAVE FOUND
SOMEONE THROUGH WHOM
WE CAN LIVE IT OUT.

756
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,233
THE BODY OF THE ONE
YOU INHABIT

757
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,277
HAS ITS OWN LIFE TO LEAD.

758
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,862
SHE WILL ACCEPT OURS.

759
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,739
SHE WILL NOT.

760
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,075
SHE IS FIGHTING
FOR HER OWN IDENTITY.

761
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,495
HER MIND WILL ACCEPT
OUR THOUGHTS.

762
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,582
OUR LIVES
WILL BE FULFILLED.

763
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,669
WILL SHE LEARN
THE WAY THE PEOPLE
ON MEMORY ALPHA LEARNED?

764
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,629
WE DID NOT WISH TO KILL.

765
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,173
BUT YOU DID KILL.

766
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:53,178
NO. RESISTING US
KILLED THOSE PEOPLE.

767
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,430
WE DID NOT KILL THEM.

768
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,641
THE PRICE OF YOUR
SURVIVAL IS TOO HIGH.

769
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,852
WE ONLY WANT THE GIRL.

770
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,020
YOU CAN'T HAVE HER.

771
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:05,857
YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO YOUR OWN LIFE,
BUT NOT ANOTHER'S.

772
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,658
Mira's voice:
LIFE WAS GIVEN TO ME.

773
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,163
IT IS MINE.

774
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,791
I WANT TO LIVE IT OUT.

775
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,960
I WILL--

776
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,088
McCoy: THE GIRL'S
LIFE READING

777
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,716
IS BECOMING A MATCH
TO THE ZETARIANS.

778
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,552
SHE'S LOSING.

779
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,180
Deep voice: DO NOT FIGHT US.

780
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,349
THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT
THEIR OWN DEATHS.

781
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,480
THEY WILL BE FORCED
TO ACCEPT IT.

782
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:48,774
YOU WILL ALL DIE.

783
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,403
CAPTAIN, IF WE CANNOT
COMPLETE THE PLAN,

784
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,071
THEY WILL CARRY OUT
THEIR THREAT.

785
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,448
WE MUST GET HER
INTO THE PRESSURE
CHAMBER.

786
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,202
JIM, YOU REALIZE
THE PRESSURE NEEDED
TO KILL THE ZETARS

787
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,995
MIGHT KILL
THE GIRL, TOO.

788
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,543
MIRA WILL NOT
KILL ME.

789
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,278
[ZAP]
AAH!

790
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:45,540
I TOLD YOU
SHE WOULDN'T KILL ME.

791
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,999
SECURE THE CHAMBER.

792
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,132
NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY.

793
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,935
THE ZETARS ARE
GROWING STRONGER.

794
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,148
THE WEIGHTLESS STATE
HAS BECOME THEIR
NATURAL CONDITION.

795
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,441
PRESSURIZE THE UNIT.

796
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,073
BRING PRESSURE
TO 2 ATMOSPHERES

797
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,075
AND THEN INCREASE
ONE ATMOSPHERE
PER SECOND.

798
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,054
CONTINUE INCREASING
PRESSURE.

799
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,409
PRESSURE, SPOCK,
PRESSURE.

800
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,458
PRESSURE IS DANGEROUSLY
HIGH, CAPTAIN.

801
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,586
IT MAY DAMAGE HER!

802
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,173
CONTINUE, SPOCK.

803
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,345
PRESSURE.

804
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:16,982
McCoy:
WE'VE DONE IT, JIM.

805
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,234
THEY'RE GONE.

806
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,700
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MIRA.

807
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:26,659
THEY'RE GONE.

808
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,663
THEY'RE GONE!

809
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,551
REDUCE THE PRESSURE
VERY, VERY GRADUALLY, SPOCK.

810
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:46,512
WE MAY TAX MR. SCOTT'S
PATIENCE, DOCTOR.

811
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:04,155
NOW LIE PERFECTLY
STILL, LIEUTENANT.
TRY NOT TO MOVE AT ALL.

812
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,032
TAKE DEEP,
REGULAR BREATHS.

813
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,661
NOW, DON'T HOLD IT.

814
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:11,788
CONTINUE TO BREATHE DEEPLY.

815
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:17,543
IN, OUT.
IN, OUT.

816
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:18,961
THAT'S IT.

817
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,797
NOW, YOU'LL BE IN THERE
ANOTHER 20 MINUTES,

818
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,799
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TRY TO RELAX?

819
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,972
NOW WE HAVE ALL
THE TIME IN THE WORLD.

820
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,622
BONES, ARE YOU
ABLE TO JUDGE

821
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,708
THE LONG-RANGE EFFECTS
ON LIEUTENANT ROMAINE?

822
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,210
WHEN THE PERSONALITY
OF A HUMAN IS INVOLVED,

823
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,920
EXACT PREDICTIONS
ARE HAZARDOUS.

824
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,298
PARTICULARLY WHERE HUMANS
ARE INVOLVED, DOCTOR.

825
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,760
HOWEVER, DESPITE STARFLEET
JUDGMENT OF THE PLIANCY
OF THE LIEUTENANT,

826
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,512
SHE PUT UP
A VALIANT STRUGGLE

827
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:10,680
TO RETAIN HER IDENTITY,

828
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,515
AND I FIND THAT
ENCOURAGING.

829
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,600
DR. McCOY
IS CORRECT, CAPTAIN.

830
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:16,644
WHILE THE TRUTH
WAS DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT,

831
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,522
WHEN IT WAS REVEALED,
THE GIRL REACTED WELL.

832
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,774
I WOULD SAY HER STRUGGLE
IN THIS EXPERIENCE

833
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,276
WOULD STRENGTHEN
HER ENTIRE EGO STRUCTURE.

834
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,695
WOULD EITHER
OF YOU CREDIT

835
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,865
SCOTTY'S STEADFAST BELIEF
IN HER AS A FACTOR?

836
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:32,284
YOU MEAN
LOVE AS MOTIVATION?

837
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,248
HMM. HUMANS DO CLAIM
A GREAT DEAL

838
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:40,167
FOR THAT
PARTICULAR EMOTION.

839
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,919
I SUPPOSE IT IS
POSSIBLE. HOWEVER--

840
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,672
THERE ARE NO HOWEVERS
ABOUT IT, MR. SPOCK.

841
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,048
IT WAS A FACTOR,

842
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,343
AND IT WILL BE
A FACTOR IN
THE GIRL'S RECOVERY.

843
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,344
Kirk: DO I TAKE IT
BOTH OF YOU

844
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,889
AGREE THAT
LIEUTENANT ROMAINE

845
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,433
NEED NOT RETURN
TO STARBASE FOR
FURTHER TREATMENT?

846
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,810
WELL, I SHOULD THINK WORK
WOULD BE A BETTER THERAPY.

847
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,520
LOGICAL.

848
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,358
CAPTAIN KIRK
TO MR. SCOTT.

849
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,484
SCOTT HERE, SIR.

850
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,361
MR. SCOTT, HOW IS
LIEUTENANT ROMAINE?

851
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:07,986
BEAUTIFUL, CAPTAIN.

852
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,530
YES, MR. SCOTT.

853
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,407
DO I TAKE IT
YOU SAY THAT

854
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,991
SHE IS
FIT FOR DUTY?

855
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,368
POSITIVELY, CAPTAIN.

856
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,994
THANK YOU.

857
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,413

SULU, CAPTAIN.

859
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:20,875
MR. SULU, SET COURSE
FOR MEMORY ALPHA.

860
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,501
LIEUTENANT ROMAINE
HAS A LOT OF WORK
TO DO THERE.

861
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:23,878
YES, SIR.

862
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,882
WELL, THIS IS
AN "ENTERPRISE"
FIRST.

863
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:33,095
DR. McCOY, MR. SPOCK,
AND ENGINEER SCOTT

864
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,515
FIND THEMSELVES
IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT.

865
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,517
CAN I STAND THE STRAIN?

866
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,397
[CHUCKLES]
