MR. SPOCK.

12
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:42,083

14
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:45,834

BUT NEVER WITH THAT WORD.

58
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:16,041

AND OUR VESSEL, CAPTAIN,

60
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,166

BEFORE YOU
BEAMED HIM ABOARD?

176
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,375
YOU HEARD MR. SPOCK
YOURSELF.

177
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:28,000
MINERAL, HE CALLED IT,
LIKE LIVING ROCK.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,583
AND THAT
BECAME LINCOLN.

179
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,959
I COULDN'T TELL.

180
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,041
MAY HAVE BEEN
ANOTHER FIGURE
DOWN THERE STANDING BY.

181
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,208
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

182
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,125
I'M NOT QUITE SURE.

183
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:49,083
Kirk, voice-over: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STAR DAY 5906.4

184
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,458
WHO OR WHAT HAS BEEN BEAMED
ABOARD OUR VESSEL?

185
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,750
AN ALIEN WHO HAS CHANGED
HIMSELF INTO THIS FORM,

186
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,208
AN ILLUSION?

187
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,208
I CANNOT
CONCEIVE IT POSSIBLE

188
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,625
THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN
COULD HAVE ACTUALLY
BEEN REINCARNATED,

189
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,417
AND YET HIS KINDNESS,
HIS GENTLE WISDOM, HIS HUMOR,

190
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,834
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM
IS SO RIGHT.

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,417
YES, IF I RECALL,

192
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,417
YOUR UNION ARMY
OBSERVATION BALLOONS

193
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,083
WERE TENDERED
600 OR SO FEET HIGH.

194
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,875
WE'RE 643 MILES

195
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,125
ABOVE THE SURFACE
OF THIS PLANET.

196
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,875
YOU CAN MEASURE GREAT
DISTANCES THAT CLOSELY?

197
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,166
WE DO, SIR.

198
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:37,542
643 MILES, 2,021 FEET,
2.04 INCHES AT THIS MOMENT,

199
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:40,750
USING YOUR
OLD-STYLE MEASUREMENTS.

200
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,792
BLESS ME.

201
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,542
Uhura:
EXCUSE ME, CAPTAIN KIRK.

202
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:46,125
YES, LIEUTENANT.
MR. SCOTT--

203
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,625
WHAT A CHARMING
NEGRESS.

204
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,166
OH, FORGIVE ME, MY DEAR.

205
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,542
I KNOW THAT IN MY TIME

206
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:56,500
SOME USED THAT TERM AS
A DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY.

207
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,917
BUT WHY SHOULD
I OBJECT TO
THAT TERM, SIR?

208
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,291
YOU SEE,
IN OUR CENTURY,

209
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:05,041
WE'VE LEARNED
NOT TO FEAR WORDS.

210
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,709
MAY I PRESENT OUR COMMUNICATION
OFFICER LIEUTENANT UHUR.

211
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,083
THE FOOLISHNESS
OF MY CENTURY

212
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,458
HAD ME APOLOGIZING WHERE
NO OFFENSE WAS GIVEN.

213
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:17,542
WE'VE EACH LEARNED
TO BE DELIGHTED
WITH WHAT WE ARE.

214
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:20,792
THE VULCANS LEARNED THAT
CENTURIES BEFORE WE DID.

215
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:23,542
IT IS BASIC
TO THE VULCAN
PHILOSOPHY, SIR.

216
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,667
THE COMBINATION OF
A NUMBER OF THINGS

217
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,583
TO MAKE EXISTENCE
WORTHWHILE.

218
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:31,667
YES, PHILOSOPHY OF "NOM,"
MEANING "ALL."

219
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,083
HOW DID I KNOW THAT?

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,875
JUST AS I SEEM TO KNOW
THAT ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE,

221
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,625
YOU WILL MEET ONE
OF THE GREATEST LIVING VULCANS

222
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,583
IN ALL THE LONG HISTORY
OF YOUR PLANET.

223
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,125
MY MIND
CANNOT RECALL HIS NAME,

224
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,417
BUT I KNOW HE
WILL BE THERE.

225
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,333
WHAT IS IT THAT
POWERS YOUR
VESSEL, CAPTAIN?

226
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,375
MAY I SEE YOUR
ENGINE ROOM?

227
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,583
CERTAINLY. OUR
ENGINEERING OFFICER--

228
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,041
HAS BEEN WAITING
IN THE BRIEFING ROOM

229
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,417
FOR YOU, SIR,
FOR OVER 2 HOURS.

230
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,792
OH, DEAR.

231
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,083
IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME,
OUR COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER--

232
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,083
I WOULD
BE DELIGHTED

233
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,500
TO HAVE HER
AS GUIDE.

234
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,625
FORGIVE ME AGAIN.
WE'LL REJOIN YOU SHORTLY.

235
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,875
WHERE THE DEVIL
ARE THEY?

236
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,667
WHY, THEY'RE
PROBABLY LICKING UP
A PLATE OF HAGGIS

237
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,709
IN THE GALLEY.
THEY'VE BEEN
EVERYWHERE ELSE.

238
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:28,250
SORRY TO HAVE
BEEN DELAYED, GENTLEMEN.

239
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,458
JIM, I WOULD BE
THE LAST TO ADVISE YOU
ON YOUR COMMAND IMAGE.

240
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,375
I DOUBT THAT, BONES,
BUT CONTINUE.

241
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,166
WELL, DO I HAVE
TO LAY IT OUT FOR YOU?

242
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,834
PRACTICALLY THE ENTIRE
CREW HAS SEEN YOU

243
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:39,542
TREAT THIS IMPOSTOR
LIKE THE REAL THING,

244
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:42,208
WHEN HE CAN'T POSSIBLY
BE THE REAL ARTICLE.

245
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:46,083
LINCOLN DIED 3 CENTURIES AGO
ON A PLANET HUNDREDS OF
LIGHT YEARS AWAY.

246
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,792
MORE THAT
DIRECTION, ENGINEER.

247
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,250
McCOY: YOU'RE
THE SCIENCE OFFICER.

248
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,875
WHY AREN'T YOU, WELL,

249
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,458
DOING WHATEVER
A SCIENCE OFFICER DOES

250
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,166
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

251
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,333
I AM, DOCTOR.

252
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,333
I AM OBSERVING THE ALIEN.

253
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,834
AT LAST!
AT LEAST SOMEBODY

254
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,542
AGREES WITH US
HE'S AN ALIEN.

255
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,125
YES, OF COURSE
HE'S AN ALIEN.

256
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,792
AND HE'S
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.

257
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:10,417
MAD, LOONY
AS AN ARCTURIAN
DOG BIRD.

258
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,625
GENTLEMEN...

259
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,750
AS YOU KNOW,
MR. SPOCK AND I
HAVE BEEN INVITED

260
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,166
TO BEAM DOWN TO
THE PLANET'S SURFACE
WITH HIM.

261
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,250
ANY COMMENTS ON THAT?

262
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,166
YES. A BIG ONE.

263
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,125
SUDDENLY, MIRACULOUSLY,

264
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,583
WE SEE A SMALL SPOT

265
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,083
OF EARTH-TYPE ENVIRONMENT
DOWN THERE.

266
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,834
NOW, IS IT REALLY THERE,

267
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:33,333
OR DO WE JUST THINK
WE SEE IT DOWN THERE?

268
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,667
YOU MIGHT BEAM DOWN
INTO A SEA OF
MOLTEN LAVA.

269
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,208
BUT WHY WOULD HE WANT
TO KILL ONLY 2 OF US?

270
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,917
IT WOULD BE ILLOGICAL.

271
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:43,125
WITH SUCH ABILITIES,
THEY COULD AS EASILY
TRICK US

272
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,917
INTO DESTROYING
THE ENTIRE VESSEL.

273
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,667
ARE YOU IMPLYING,
MR. SPOCK,

274
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,417
THAT IT'S
PROBABLY SAFE
TO BEAM DOWN THERE?

275
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,458
NO, I'M NOT, DOCTOR.

276
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,750
THERE'S NO DOUBT
THEY WANT US DOWN THERE

277
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,917
FOR SOME HIDDEN PURPOSE.

278
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,125
OTHERWISE, THEY
WOULD HAVE REVEALED

279
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,959
SOME LOGICAL REASON
FOR ALL OF THIS.

280
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,041
WHY...LINCOLN, SPOCK?

281
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,125
ANY SPECULATION ON THAT?

282
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,875
SPECULATION IS
UNNECESSARY, CAPTAIN.

283
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,583
THE ANSWER IS CLEAR.

284
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,250
PRESIDENT LINCOLN
HAS ALWAYS BEEN

285
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,834
A VERY PERSONAL
HERO TO YOU.

286
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,291
WHAT BETTER WAY
TO TITILLATE
YOUR CURIOSITY

287
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,875
THAN TO MAKE HIM
COME ALIVE FOR YOU?

288
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,792
BUT NOT ONLY TO ME, SPOCK.

289
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:20,750
AGREED.

290
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,500
I, TOO,
EXPERIENCED HIS CHARM.

291
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,583
IT IS A MAGNIFICENT
WORK OF DUPLICATION.

292
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,500
McCOY: BUT HE HOLDS

293
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,959
A SPECIAL
INVOLVEMENT
TO YOU, JIM.

294
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,917
AND I THINK
IT'S INTERESTING,

295
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,500
INASMUCH
AS YOU'RE THE ONE

296
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,709
WHO'S GOING TO MAKE
THE DECISION WHETHER
TO BEAM DOWN OR NOT.

297
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,875
DON'T DO IT,
CAPTAIN.

298
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,291
THE VERY REASON

299
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,834
FOR THE EXISTENCE
OF OUR STARSHIPS

300
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:59,375
IS CONTACT WITH OTHER LIFE.

301
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,917
ALTHOUGH THE METHOD IS
BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION,

302
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:04,917
WE HAVE BEEN OFFERED
CONTACT.

303
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,041
THEREFORE...

304
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,250
I SHALL BEAM DOWN.

305
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,542
MR. SPOCK, AS FOR YOU...

306
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,291
CAPTAIN,
SINCE I WAS INCLUDED

307
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,208
IN THE INVITATION
TO MAKE CONTACT, I MUST
BEAM DOWN WITH YOU.

308
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,083
YOU'RE BOTH
OUT OF YOUR HEAD!

309
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,333
AYE, SIR.

310
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,834
AND YOU'RE
ON THE EDGE OF
INSUBORDINATION!

311
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,750
WOULD I BE ON THE EDGE
OF INSUBORDINATION
TO REMIND THE CAPTAIN

312
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,041
THAT THIS SMELLS
OF SOMETHING
HAPPENING TO HIM

313
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,792
THAT I MIGHT NOT
BE ABLE TO PATCH
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN?

314
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:29,750
AYE.

315
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,083
GENTLEMEN, YOUR
CONCERN IS NOTED
AND APPRECIATED.

316
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,083
MR. SPOCK,
STANDARD DRESS,

317
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,000
TRICORDERS
AND PHASERS.

318
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,458
WE WILL GUIDE
PRESIDENT LINCOLN

319
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,583
TO THE
TRANSPORTER ROOM.

320
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,500
WE'LL BEAM DOWN
IMMEDIATELY.

321
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:56,000
STANDING BY, MR. SCOTT.

322
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,959
TRANSPORTER ROOM
TO BRIDGE, STANDING BY.

323
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,166
Chekov: WE ARE NOW LOCKED IN
SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT, MR. SCOTT.

324
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,041
SENSORS CONTINUE
TO SHOW THE AREA

325
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,333
AS COMPLETELY EARTH-LIKE
IN ALL RESPECTS.

326
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,458
IF THEY'RE WRONG
AND THEY DO BEAM

327
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,583
INTO A POOL
OF LAVA...

328
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,291
THEN THEY'RE DEAD MEN.

329
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,542
I COULDNA PULL THEM
BACK IN TIME.

330
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,792
ALL RIGHT, MR. SCOTT.
ENERGIZE.

331
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,583
SCOTTY.

332
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,458
Spock: CAPTAIN...

333
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:04,208
OUR PHASERS AND TRICORDERS
DID NOT BEAM DOWN WITH US.

334
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,291
KIRK TO
"ENTERPRISE."
"ENTERPRISE"?

335
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,166
"ENTERPRISE,"
COME IN.

336
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,291
KIRK TO
"ENTERPRISE."

337
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,583
"ENTERPRISE,"
COME IN.

338
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,083
UNDAMAGED, YET SOMETHING

339
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,834
IS PREVENTING THEM
FROM FUNCTIONING.

340
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,500
COME IN, LANDING PARTY.
REPORT!

341
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,458
"ENTERPRISE" TO CAPTAIN KIRK.
CAN YOU READ US?

342
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,458
IF THEY'RE
ALL RIGHT,

343
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,458
THEY SHOULD
HAVE REPORTED IN.

344
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,083
YOUR EXPLANATION,
SIR?

345
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,333
WELL, I HAVE NONE.
TO ME, THIS SEEMS QUITE
AS IT SHOULD BE.

346
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,166
WHY WERE OUR WEAPONS TAKEN?
WHY CAN'T WE COMMUNICATE
WITH OUR SHIP?

347
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,625
PLEASE, BELIEVE ME,

348
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,834
I KNOW NOTHING
OTHER THAN WHAT
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

349
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:46,583
THE GAME IS OVER.
WE'VE TREATED YOU
WITH COURTESY.

350
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,750
WE'VE GONE ALONG
WITH WHAT AND WHO
YOU THINK YOU ARE.

351
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,625
DESPITE THE SEEMING
CONTRADICTIONS,

352
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,542
ALL IS AS IT APPEARS TO BE.

353
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:55,041
I AM ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

354
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,792
Man: JUST AS I AM

355
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,375
WHOM I APPEAR TO BE.

356
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,792
SURAK.

357
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,208
WHO?

358
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,834
THE GREATEST OF ALL
WHO EVER LIVED ON
OUR PLANET, CAPTAIN.

359
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:10,333
THE FATHER OF
ALL WE BECAME.

360
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,083
ALL SHIP'S SYSTEMS
GOING DEAD.

361
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,792
SWITCH TO RESERVE POWER.

362
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,333
ALL DECKS REPORT STATUS.

363
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,583
ALL DECKS
REPORT STATUS.

364
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,041
ALL DECKS
REPORT STATUS.

365
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,959
BRIDGE TO ENGINEERING.
COME IN.

366
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,208
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO OUR POWER?

367
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,583
BRIDGE TO ENGINEERING, REPORT.

368
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,000
Engineer: EVERYTHING'S OUT.

369
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,417
WE'VE SWITCHED TO RESERVE POWER.

370
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,792
LOST ALL POWER
IN THE WARP ENGINES.

371
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:32,917
HOW IS IT,
MR. SULU?

372
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:33,959
NO ANSWER YET
ON WHAT CAUSED IT.

373
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,125
THEY'RE STANDING BY.

374
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,583
SHUT DOWN ALL BUT THE MOST
NECESSARY SYSTEMS.

375
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,709
NO DAMAGE REPORT,
MR. SCOTT.

376
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:43,333
Engineer: NO INDICATION
OF ENGINE DAMAGE, SIR.

377
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,667
ENGAGE
RESTART CYCLE.

378
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,875
Engineer: I CAN'T.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

379
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,250
START EMERGENCY
PROCEDURES.

380
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,250
Engineer: AYE, AYE, SIR.

381
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,125
LIVE LONG
AND PROSPER, SPOCK.

382
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,041
MAY YOU ALSO,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

383
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,500
IT IS NOT
LOGICAL THAT
YOU ARE SURAK.

384
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,291
THERE
IS NO FACT,

385
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,625
EXTRAPOLATION
OF FACT,

386
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,041
OR THEORY
WHICH WOULD
MAKE POSSIBLE--

387
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,583
WHATEVER I AM,

388
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,375
WOULD IT HARM YOU
TO GIVE RESPONSE?

389
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,542
LIVE LONG AND PROSPER,
IMAGE OF SURAK--

390
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,667
FATHER OF ALL
WE NOW HOLD TRUE.

391
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:21,375
THE "IMAGE OF SURAK"
READ IN YOUR FACE

392
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,458
WHAT IS IN
YOUR MIND, SPOCK.

393
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,375
AS I TURNED
AND MY EYES BEHELD YOU,

394
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,750
I DISPLAYED EMOTION.

395
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,959
I BEG FORGIVENESS.

396
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,000
THE CAUSE WAS MORE
THAN SUFFICIENT.

397
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
LET US SPEAK
NO FURTHER OF IT.

398
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,583
IN MY TIME, WE KNEW NOT
OF EARTH MEN.

399
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,875
I AM PLEASED TO SEE THAT
WE HAVE DIFFERENCES.

400
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,917
MAY WE TOGETHER
BECOME GREATER

401
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:47,959
THAN THE SUM
OF BOTH OF US.

402
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,792
SPOCK, WE'LL NOT GO ALONG
WITH THESE CHARADES ANY LONGER.

403
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,000
[SCRAPING]

404
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,000
YOU'LL HAVE AN ANSWER
SOON, CAPTAIN.

405
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,333
OUR WORLD
IS CALLED EXCALBIA.

406
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,750
COUNTLESS WHO LIVE
ON THAT PLANET ARE WATCHING.

407
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,458
BEFORE THIS DRAMA UNFOLDS,

408
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:22,375
WE GIVE WELCOME TO THE ONES
NAMED KIRK AND SPOCK.

409
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,709
WE KNOW NOTHING
OF YOUR WORLD

410
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:27,959
OR YOUR CUSTOMS.

411
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:30,125
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

412
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,250
DRAMA ABOUT TO UNFOLD?

413
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,500
YOU'RE AN INTELLIGENT
LIFE FORM.

414
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,750
I'M SURPRISED
YOU DO NOT PERCEIVE
THE HONOR WE DO YOU.

415
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,041
HAVE WE NOT CREATED
IN THIS PLACE ON OUR PLANET

416
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,834
A STAGE IDENTICAL
TO YOUR OWN WORLD?

417
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,000
WE PERCEIVE
THAT WE WERE INVITED
TO COME DOWN HERE,

418
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,166
AND WE CAME
IN FRIENDSHIP,

419
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,959
AND YOU HAVE DEPRIVED US

420
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:52,250
OF OUR INSTRUMENTS
TO EXAMINE YOUR WORLD,

421
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,375
TO DEFEND OURSELVES,

422
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,250
TO COMMUNICATE
WITH OUR VESSEL.

423
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,458
YOUR OBJECTION
IS WELL TAKEN.

424
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,000
WE SHALL COMMUNICATE
WITH YOUR VESSEL

425
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,875
SO THAT YOUR FELLOW
LIFE FORMS MAY ALSO ENJOY

426
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,625
AND PROFIT...

427
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,792
FROM THE PLAY.

428
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:10,125
BEHOLD...

429
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,417
[CLICK CLICK]

430
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,375
CAPTAIN, MR. SPOCK,

431
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,417
SOME OF THESE YOU
MAY KNOW THROUGH HISTORY.

432
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,792
GENGHIS KHAN, FOR ONE,

433
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:35,208
AND COLONEL GREEN,
WHO LED A GENOCIDAL WAR

434
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,667
EARLY IN THE 21st CENTURY
ON EARTH.

435
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,375
ZORA, WHO EXPERIMENTED
WITH THE BODY CHEMISTRY

436
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,208
OF SUBJECT TRIBES
ON TIBURON.

437
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,333
KAHLESS THE UNFORGETTABLE,

438
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,792
THE KLINGON
WHO SET THE PATTERN

439
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:51,959
FOR HIS PLANET'S TYRANNIES.

440
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,542
WE WELCOME
THE VESSEL "ENTERPRISE"

441
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:57,709
TO OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
AND TO OUR SPECTACLE.

442
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,709
WELL, AT LEAST THE CAPTAIN
AND SPOCK ARE SAFE.

443
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:02,625
IT'S A CONFRONTATION
OF SOME SORT.

444
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,875
THOSE ARE ALL FIGURES
OUT OF HISTORY,

445
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,709
NOTORIOUSLY EVIL.

446
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:08,875
Excalbian: WE ASK YOU
TO OBSERVE WITH US

447
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,333
THE CONFRONTATION
OF THE 2 OPPOSING
PHILOSOPHIES

448
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:15,583
YOU TERM
"GOOD" AND "EVIL."

449
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:18,166
SINCE THIS IS
OUR FIRST EXPERIMENT
WITH EARTHLINGS,

450
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,250
OUR THEME
IS A SIMPLE ONE:

451
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,333
SURVIVAL,
LIFE AND DEATH.

452
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,625
YOUR PHILOSOPHIES
ARE ALIEN TO US,

453
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,959
AND WE WISH
TO UNDERSTAND THEM

454
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:31,625
AND DISCOVER WHICH
IS THE STRONGER.

455
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,750
WE LEARN
BY OBSERVING
SUCH SPECTACLES.

456
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,959
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SURVIVAL?

457
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,583
THE WORD IS EXPLICIT.

458
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:43,083
IF YOU AND SPOCK SURVIVE,
YOU RETURN TO YOUR VESSEL.

459
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,458
IF YOU DO NOT...

460
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,041
YOUR EXISTENCE IS ENDED.

461
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:02,458
CAN WE BEAM THE CAPTAIN
AND SPOCK BACK UP?

462
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,625
WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER.

463
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:07,417
THEY'LL COME ABOARD
A MASS OF DYING FLESH.

464
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:09,625
WELL, CAN WE SEND
THE PHASERS DOWN?

465
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,542
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO, DOCTOR,

466
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,083
NOTHING BUT WATCH THEM.

467
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:16,542
HE'S SKIMMED
THE WORST ONES IN
HISTORY TO FACE THEM.

468
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,750
BUT THEY'RE NOT REAL,

469
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,333
ANY MORE THAN
THAT LINCOLN OR SURAK.

470
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,875
WHAT DO
THE SENSORS READ?

471
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,667
AS LIFE FORMS.
THEY ARE LIVING BEINGS.

472
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,417
COULD THEY BE
ALIENS PROJECTING
AN ILLUSION?

473
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:37,458
THE READINGS
ARE THOSE OF HUMANOIDS.

474
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:38,542
Excalbian: WHY DO YOU HESITATE?

475
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,834
DO YOU WISH
FURTHER CLARIFICATION?

476
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:44,333
YOUR CHOICE OF ACTION
IS UNLIMITED,

477
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,667
AS IS YOUR CHOICE
OF WEAPONS.

478
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,208
SHOULD YOU WISH
TO USE ANY,

479
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:49,792
YOU MAY FABRICATE
ANYTHING YOU DESIRE

480
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:53,375
OUT OF WHAT YOU CAN FIND
AROUND YOU.

481
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,583
CAPTAIN?

482
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,625
MR. SPOCK AND I REFUSE
TO PARTICIPATE.

483
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,542
YOU WILL
DECIDE OTHERWISE.

484
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:31,250
ANALYSIS, SPOCK.

485
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,917
WHY DO THEY WANT US
TO FIGHT?

486
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:36,583
IT MAY BE EXACTLY AS
EXPLAINED, CAPTAIN.

487
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:37,709
OUR CONCEPT
OF GOOD AND EVIL

488
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:39,333
IS STRANGE TO THEM.

489
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,041
PERHAPS THEY
WISH TO DETERMINE
WHICH IS STRONGEST.

490
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,417
AND THEY'LL GET THEIR
ANSWER IF IT KILLS US.

491
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:51,250
I'M AFRAID NONE OF US
MAY LEAVE, GENTLEMEN,

492
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,417
UNTIL WE DO WHAT
IT DEMANDS OF US.

493
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:00,291
Colonel Green:
CAPTAIN KIRK?

494
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,166
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU?

495
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,417
I QUITE AGREE
WITH YOUR ATTITUDE

496
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:05,792
TOWARD THIS CHARADE.

497
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:08,750
IT'S RIDICULOUS
TO THINK THAT WE
SHOULD TAKE PART IN IT.

498
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,667
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

499
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:13,000
THE SAME THING AS YOU DO,
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

500
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,417
I HAVE NO QUARREL
WITH YOU

501
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,625
ANY MORE THAN
YOU HAVE WITH ME.

502
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:20,333
YOU'RE SOMEWHAT
DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY

503
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,458
HISTORY PAINTS YOU,
COLONEL GREEN.

504
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:25,291
HISTORY TENDS
TO EXAGGERATE.

505
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:28,625
I SUGGEST WE CALL
A HALT TO THIS AT ONCE

506
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:30,417
AND SEE IF WE CAN'T
FIND SOME WAY

507
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:32,000
OUT OF OUR DIFFICULTIES.

508
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
MY ASSOCIATES ARE
IN FULL AGREEMENT
WITH ME.

509
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,125
CAPTAIN,
YOU WERE TRICKED

510
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,417
INTO COMING HERE,
WEREN'T YOU?

511
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:42,709
SO WERE WE ALL.

512
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,709
WHERE DO YOU
COME FROM?

513
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:51,709
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

514
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,542
ISN'T THAT STRANGE?

515
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:56,208
MY MEMORY USED TO BE
QUITE REMARKABLE.

516
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:58,250
WELL...

517
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,083
WHEREVER IT WAS,

518
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,709
I WANT TO GET BACK.

519
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:02,834
SO IT SEEMS TO ME,
CAPTAIN,

520
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:05,458
THAT WE HAVE
A COMMON CAUSE.

521
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,834
AND OUR ENEMY
IS THAT CREATURE.

522
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,750
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE?

523
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,125
Green: THAT
WE COMBINE FORCES

524
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:16,917
AND REASON SOME WAY
TO OVERCOME IT.

525
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:19,291
YOU WERE NOTORIOUS,
COLONEL GREEN,

526
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,542
FOR STRIKING
AT YOUR ENEMIES

527
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:23,959
IN THE MIDST OF
NEGOTIATING WITH THEM.

528
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:26,333
Green: BUT THAT
WAS CENTURIES AGO, CAPTAIN,

529
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,750
AND NOT ALTOGETHER TRUE.

530
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,709
NO, THERE'S MUCH
I WOULD CHANGE NOW
IF I COULD.

531
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:35,500
DON'T LET PREJUDICE
AND RUMORS SWAY YOU.

532
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:39,625
CAPTAIN!

533
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:42,542
HOW CAN WE
WARN HIM?

534
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,625
ANYONE HURT?

535
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:28,000
OH, I FEAR MY CLOTHING
IS SOMEWHAT DAMAGED,

536
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,500
BUT HOW DELIGHTFUL
TO DISCOVER AT MY AGE

537
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
THAT I CAN
STILL WRESTLE.

538
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,834
MR. SPOCK?

539
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:35,875
I'M ALL RIGHT, CAPTAIN.
HOWEVER, I SUGGEST

540
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:37,917
THAT WE PREPARE OURSELVES
FOR ANOTHER ATTACK.

541
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,375
NO. I THINK
COLONEL GREEN
IS RIGHT.

542
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,500
THAT ROCK-LIKE THING
IS OUR ENEMY,

543
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,834
NOT THOSE ILLUSIONS.

544
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,375
FOR AN ILLUSION,
MY OPPONENT CARRIED

545
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,792
A CONSIDERABLE PUNCH.

546
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,709
OH, I FORGOT.

547
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:52,959
YOU CONSIDER ME
AN ILLUSION, TOO.

548
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,959
THE CAPTAIN
SPEAKS WISELY.

549
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:57,542
THOSE 4 ARE NOT
OUR ENEMY.

550
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,000
WE SHOULD ARRIVE
TOGETHER

551
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,917
AT A PEACEFUL
SETTLEMENT.

552
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:04,208
Excalbian:
I AM DISAPPOINTED.

553
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:07,750
YOU DISPLAY NO INTEREST
IN THE HONOR WE DO YOU.

554
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,959
WE OFFER YOU
AN OPPORTUNITY

555
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,542
TO BECOME OUR TEACHERS

556
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,417
BY DEMONSTRATING
WHETHER GOOD OR EVIL
IS MORE POWERFUL.

557
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,625
OH!

558
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:18,542
YOU FIND MY BODY HEAT
DISTRESSING, CAPTAIN?

559
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,709
YOU FORGET THE NATURE
OF THIS PLANET.

560
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:22,375
I MUST CONCLUDE
THAT YOUR SPECIES

561
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,750
REQUIRES A CAUSE
TO FIGHT FOR.

562
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,583
YOU MAY NOW COMMUNICATE
WITH YOUR SHIP.

563
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,583
KIRK
TO "ENTERPRISE."

564
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,709
"ENTERPRISE,"
COME IN.

565
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,667
Scott, on intercom:
SCOTT TO ENGINEERING.
REPORT, LIEUTENANT.

566
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,125
Lieutenant: EMERGENCY
INCREASING, SIR.

567
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,000
DETERIORATION HAS
JUST STARTED, SIR.

568
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,792
GIVE ME THAT AGAIN, MAN.
I CANNOT HEAR YOU.

569
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,667
MR. SCOTT,
I HAVE THE CAPTAIN.

570
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,625
SCOTTY, DO YOU
READ ME?

571
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,834
MR. SCOTT,
I HAVE THE CAPTAIN!

572
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,750
ENGINEERING, CHECK
FOR RADIATION.

573
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,166
GET A REPAIR CREW ON IT AT ONCE.

574
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:58,458
Engineer: WE HAVE
ALREADY, SIR.

575
00:29:58,458 --> 00:29:59,625
WE CAN'T SEEM TO STOP IT.

576
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,375
IS THERE A DANGER OF DETONATION?

577
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:02,667
Engineer: ESTIMATING
4 HOURS, SIR.

578
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,834
RED ALERT, CAPTAIN.

579
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:05,625
MR. SCOTT IS
STANDING BY.

580
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:06,750
Kirk: WHAT CAUSED THE RED ALERT?

581
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,125
I DON'T
KNOW YET, SIR.

582
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,417
CAPTAIN.
SCOTTY,
BEAM US UP FAST.

583
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,917
I CANNOT. WE HAVE
A COMPLETE POWER FAILURE.

584
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:15,375
WE'RE ON EMERGENCY BATTERY
POWER ONLY.

585
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,625
WHAT HAPPENED?

586
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,709
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT, SIR,

587
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:20,166
BUT THE MATTER
AND ANTIMATTER

588
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,959
ARE IN RED ZONE
PROXIMITY.

589
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,291
WHAT CAUSED THAT?

590
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:26,792
THERE'S NO KNOWING,
AND THERE'S NO
STOPPING IT, EITHER.

591
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,083
THE SHIELDING
IS BREAKING DOWN,

592
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:31,041
AND I ESTIMATE 4 HOURS
BEFORE IT GOES COMPLETELY.

593
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,000
4 HOURS BEFORE
THE SHIP BLOWS UP.

594
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,375
THE ESTIMATE
IS QUITE CORRECT.

595
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:42,583
YOUR SHIP WILL
BLOW ITSELF TO BITS

596
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:45,333
WITHIN 4 HOURS, CAPTAIN,

597
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,959
UNLESS YOU DEFEAT
THE OTHERS BEFORE THEN.

598
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:51,625
IS THAT CAUSE ENOUGH
TO FIGHT FOR?

599
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,542
WHAT IF THEY
DEFEAT US?

600
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:57,291
TO SAVE YOUR SHIP
AND YOUR CREW,
YOU HAVE TO WIN.

601
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,875
SCOTTY, INFORM
STARFLEET COMMAND.

602
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:02,917
DISENGAGE
THE CELLS.

603
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:03,917
JETTISON,
IF POSSIBLE.

604
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:04,959
MR. SPOCK,
ASSIST THEM.

605
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:07,083
ADVISE AND ANALYZE.

606
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,041
SCOTTY?

607
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,417
SCOTTY?

608
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,667
YOUR COMMUNICATOR

609
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:15,583
IS NO LONGER
FUNCTIONING, CAPTAIN.

610
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,750
YOU MAY PROCEED
WITH THE SPECTACLE.

611
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,583
JAMES, THE WAR
IS FORCED UPON US.

612
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,166
HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF.

613
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:38,500
Scott: SUPPLEMENTAL LOG,
STARDATE 5906.5.

614
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,000
ENGINEER SCOTT REPORTING.

615
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,667
THE "ENTERPRISE" IS DOOMED
TO EXPLODE IN 2 HOURS

616
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,625
IF CAPTAIN KIRK
IS DEFEATED BY THE ENEMY

617
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:46,417
ON THE SURFACE
OF THE PLANET.

618
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:50,000
THE ENORMOUS POWER
OF THE "ENTERPRISE"
HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED,

619
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,250
AND WE SIT HERE WATCHING,
UNABLE TO ASSIST.

620
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,917
DID YOU SET THE TRAPS?

621
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:57,834
YES.

622
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,125
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

623
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,291
THEY'VE DONE
NOTHING.

624
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,125
THEY'VE NOT
ARMED THEMSELVES
NOR PREPARED

625
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:04,000
FOR ANY KIND
OF DEFENSE.

626
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,750
I SAY ATTACK NOW
AND FINISH THEM.

627
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,542
WITH WHAT?
THESE?

628
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:08,709
BETTER THAN
WHAT THEY HAVE.

629
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:11,875
NO, IT'S NOT
ADVANTAGE ENOUGH.

630
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,417
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE ODDS ARE IN OUR FAVOR.

631
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:15,875
OVERWHELM AND DEVASTATE,

632
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,583
THAT'S THE WAY TO GET POWER
AND TO HOLD IT,

633
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,500
AND I MEAN TO DO THAT.

634
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,041
THERE'S NOTHING IMMORAL

635
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:24,041
ABOUT FIGHTING
AN ILLUSION, MR. SPOCK.

636
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:26,375
WE PLAY
THEIR GAME. FIGHT,

637
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,709
OR LOSE THE SHIP

638
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:28,667
AND ALL THE CREWMEN
ABOARD.

639
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:29,959
AND IF THEY'RE
REAL, CAPTAIN?

640
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,000
WE'LL USE THIS...

641
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,875
AS A BASE.

642
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,500
IT'S DEFENSIBLE.

643
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:52,709
THEY CAN'T APPROACH
WITHOUT BEING SEEN.

644
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:54,500
ARE WE FIGHTING
A DEFENSIVE WAR, JAMES?

645
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,542
NO, WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

646
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:57,125
BUT IF THINGS
DO GO AGAINST US,

647
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,917
I WANT A PLACE
TO RETREAT TO.

648
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:00,709
WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW
IS SCOUT THEM OUT,

649
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:03,166
FIND THEIR WEAKNESSES,
AND ATTACK.

650
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:05,291
HMM. DO YOU
DRINK WHISKEY?

651
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:06,333
OCCASIONALLY. WHY?

652
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,542
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
QUALITIES VERY MUCH

653
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:08,583
LIKE THOSE
OF ANOTHER MAN

654
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,291
I ADMIRE GREATLY--
GENERAL GRANT.

655
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:13,125
THANK YOU.

656
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,375
HA HA.
THANK YOU.

657
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,583
MR. SPOCK,
WE'LL NEED WEAPONS.

658
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,917
I BELIEVE
THE ANCIENT VULCANS

659
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,333
MADE SOMETHING
LIKE A BOOMERANG.

660
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,750
YES, CAPTAIN.

661
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,750
AND SLINGS
AND SPEARS.

662
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,542
SLINGS.
MR. PRESIDENT,

663
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:28,333
YOU USED A SLING
AS A BOY.

664
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,417
INDEED I DID.

665
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:33,208
CAPTAIN,
LOGIC DICTATES

666
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:35,333
THAT WE CONSIDER
ANOTHER COURSE.

667
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:44,667
WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME, SPOCK.

668
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:45,834
IN MY TIME ON VULCAN,

669
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:49,917
WE ALSO FACED
THESE SAME ALTERNATIVES.

670
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:52,041
WE'D SUFFERED
DEVASTATING WARS

671
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,917
WHICH NEARLY DESTROYED
OUR PLANET.

672
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:57,333
ANOTHER WAS
ABOUT TO BEGIN.

673
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,417
WE WERE TORN.

674
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:00,417
BUT OUT OF
OUR SUFFERINGS,

675
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:03,750
SOME OF US
FOUND THE DISCIPLINE TO ACT.

676
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,834
WE SENT EMISSARIES
TO OUR OPPONENTS

677
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:08,333
TO PROPOSE PEACE.

678
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,500
THE FIRST WERE KILLED,

679
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,667
BUT OTHERS FOLLOWED.

680
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:15,458
ULTIMATELY,
WE ACHIEVED PEACE,

681
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,792
WHICH HAS LASTED
SINCE THEN.

682
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:20,000
CIRCUMSTANCES
WERE DIFFERENT THEN,

683
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,041
SURAK.

684
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:25,291
THE FACE OF WAR
HAS NEVER CHANGED, CAPTAIN.

685
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:26,458
SURELY IT IS MORE LOGICAL

686
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,959
TO--TO HEAL THAN KILL.

687
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:31,375
I'M AFRAID
THAT KIND OF LOGIC

688
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:32,834
DOESN'T APPLY HERE.

689
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:35,792
THAT IS PRECISELY WHY
WE SHOULD NOT FIGHT.

690
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:38,417
MY SHIP IS AT STAKE.

691
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:50,875
I WILL NOT HARM OTHERS,
CAPTAIN.

692
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,500
Spock: HIS CONVICTIONS
ARE MOST PROFOUND

693
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,583
IN THIS MATTER,
CAPTAIN.

694
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:55,208
SO ARE MINE, SPOCK.

695
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,583
IF I BELIEVED
THAT THERE WAS

696
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:57,750
A PEACEFUL WAY
OUT OF THIS--

697
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,542
THE RISK WILL BE
MINE ALONE.

698
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:04,083
IF I FAIL,
YOU LOSE NOTHING.

699
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,000
AFTER ALL,
I'M NO WARRIOR.

700
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,458
THE CAPTAIN KNOWS
THAT I HAVE FOUGHT

701
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,625
AT HIS SIDE BEFORE,

702
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:12,041
AND WILL DO SO NOW,
IF NEED BE.

703
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:15,542
HOWEVER, I, TOO,
AM A VULCAN,

704
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,083
BRED TO PEACE.

705
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:20,250
LET HIM ATTEMPT IT.

706
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,166
YOU SAW HOW
TREACHEROUSLY
THEY ACTED.

707
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,959
OH, YES.

708
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:29,917
BUT PERHAPS IT'S
OUR BELIEF IN PEACE

709
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:31,583
THAT IS ACTUALLY
BEING TESTED.

710
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,041
HMM?

711
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,291
I HAVE NO AUTHORITY
OVER YOU.

712
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,583
YOU MAY DO
AS YOU THINK BEST.

713
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:43,542
THANK YOU.

714
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:47,750
MAY YOU LIVE LONG
AND PROSPER.

715
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:56,083
THE WEAPONS,
GENTLEMEN.

716
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,166
IN CASE HE FAILS.

717
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,333
COLONEL!

718
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,083
NO.

719
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:32,375
LET'S HEAR WHAT
HE HAS TO SAY.

720
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:33,959
WE MAY FIND IT USEFUL.

721
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,875
STOP THERE, VULCAN.

722
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,250
STATE YOUR PURPOSE.

723
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,500
I COME IN PEACE
TO PROPOSE PEACE.

724
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,000
ARE YOU SURRENDERING?

725
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,291
I AM DOING
WHAT I CONSIDER BEST

726
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,542
FOR ALL OF US.

727
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,875
IF YOU CHOOSE
TO REGARD THAT
AS...SURRENDER,

728
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:57,166
I ACCEPT
YOUR DEFINITION.

729
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,917
ONE OF THOSE
PEACE LOVERS, COLONEL.

730
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,000
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

731
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,208
DO YOU SPEAK
FOR THE OTHERS?

732
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,500
NO, I SPEAK FOR MYSELF,

733
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,792
BECAUSE
I ABHOR VIOLENCE.

734
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,291
BUT IF YOU ACCEPT
THE SOLUTION I OFFER,

735
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:11,625
THEY, TOO,
WILL ACCEPT IT.

736
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:14,000
HOW CAN I BE SURE?

737
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,083
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO TRICK ME, VULCAN.

738
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:19,250
I THINK THAT WHILE
YOU'RE HERE TALKING PEACE,

739
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,750
THE OTHERS ARE PREPARING
TO ATTACK.

740
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,000
NO, COLONEL.

741
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,458
THEY ARE AT THEIR BASE
AWAITING AN ANSWER.

742
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,333
HOW CAN I BELIEVE THAT?

743
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,333
NO ONE TALKS PEACE

744
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,750
UNLESS HE'S READY
TO BACK IT UP WITH WAR.

745
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,667
HE TALKS PEACE
IF IT IS THE ONLY
WAY TO LIVE.

746
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,875
THEN TELL ME,

747
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,542
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO GAIN IF WE ACCEPT?

748
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:40,792
NOTHING
BUT THE KNOWLEDGE

749
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,041
THAT I HAVE DONE
WHAT I BELIEVE IN.

750
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,875
WELL, WHAT DO I
GET OUT OF IT?

751
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,417
I FIGHT FOR GAIN,
VULCAN.

752
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:50,125
WHAT DO I GAIN HERE?

753
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:52,500
YOUR LIFE AND THE LIVES
OF THE OTHERS.

754
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,125
YOU SAID YOURSELF,
COLONEL,

755
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:02,750
THAT WE HAVE
COMMON CAUSE--
TO SURVIVE.

756
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,959
TOGETHER, WE CAN.

757
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:07,291
BUT NOT BY WARRING.

758
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:08,333
WHY DON'T WE
KILL HIM?

759
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:12,166
NO! HE'S OUR MEANS
TO FINISH THEM ALL.

760
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:16,500
Surak: COLONEL,
SURELY YOU ACCEPT
THE LOGIC OF THIS.

761
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,041
WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER?

762
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:21,041
YOU'RE VERY
PERSUASIVE, VULCAN.

763
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,166
I'D LIKE
TO COME OUT OF THIS

764
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,375
WITH A WHOLE SKIN.

765
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:27,417
PERHAPS I CAN CONVINCE
MY ASSOCIATES

766
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:29,667
THAT IT WOULD BE
TO THEIR ADVANTAGE ALSO.

767
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:54,834
YOUR SURAK
IS A BRAVE MAN.

768
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:57,458
MEN OF PEACE
USUALLY ARE, CAPTAIN.

769
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:58,792
ON VULCAN,
HE IS REVERED

770
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:02,375
AS THE FATHER
OF OUR CIVILIZATION.

771
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,417
THE FATHER IMAGE HOLDS
MUCH MEANING FOR US.

772
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,375
DO YOU SHOW EMOTION,
SPOCK?

773
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,083
I DEEPLY RESPECT

774
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,083
WHAT HE
HAS ACCOMPLISHED.

775
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,417
WELL, I HOPE
HE ACCOMPLISHES

776
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:15,792
SOMETHING HERE...
AND SOON.

777
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:18,291
[MAN SCREAMS]

778
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,500

779
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,125
Surak's voice:
HELP ME, SPOCK!

780
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,291
Surak's voice:
SPOCK, HELP ME!

781
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:36,333
Green: MR. SPOCK,
YOUR FRIEND WANTS YOU.

782
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,000
HE SEEMS TO BE HURT.

783
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,458
SPOCK!
HELP ME, SPOCK!

784
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:45,583
SPOCK! HELP ME!

785
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:49,125
YOU CAN'T LET HIM
SUFFER.

786
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,583
THEY ARE TRYING
TO GOAD US

787
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:52,417
INTO ATTACKING,
CAPTAIN.

788
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:54,083
THEY EXPECT US
TO ACT RASHLY.

789
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,250
YES, I KNOW THAT.

790
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,500
Surak's voice:
HELP ME, SPOCK!

791
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,166
HE WAS AWARE
OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
WHEN HE WENT.

792
00:39:58,166 --> 00:40:00,333
AAH!

793
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,000
I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE LET HIM GO.

794
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,166
YOU HAD NO CHOICE,
CAPTAIN.

795
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,667
AAH!

796
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,458
YOU COULD NOT
HAVE STOPPED HIM.

797
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,125
HOW CAN YOU
IGNORE THAT?

798
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,667
A VULCAN WOULD NOT
CRY OUT SO.

799
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:18,834
WHETHER HE'S A VULCAN
OR NOT, HE'S IN AGONY.

800
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,917
I AM NOT INSENSITIVE
TO IT, CAPTAIN.

801
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:22,583
Surak's voice:
HELP ME, SPOCK!

802
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:28,542
BUT YOU CAN
JUST LISTEN TO IT
AND DO NOTHING.

803
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:30,250
AAH!

804
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,125
I CAN'T.

805
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,792
CAPTAIN, THAT IS WHAT
THEY'RE WAITING FOR.

806
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:36,750
THEY'RE WAITING FOR US
TO ATTEMPT A RESCUE.

807
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:41,375
I CAN'T JUST
LET HIM STAY THERE.

808
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:45,667
PERHAPS WE CAN
RESCUE HIM, MR. SPOCK.

809
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:47,083
NOW, I SUGGEST THAT

810
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,583
WE DO WHATEVER
THEY WANT.

811
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:50,709
DO WHAT THEY WANT,
SIR?

812
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,834
NOT THE WAY
THEY WANT IT, HOWEVER.

813
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,917
WE MUST FIRST
CONVINCE THEM

814
00:40:55,917 --> 00:41:00,583
THAT THEY HAVE PROVOKED US
TO RECKLESSNESS.

815
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,875
JAMES,

816
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:04,959
I DO NOT MEAN TO PRESUME
UPON YOUR AUTHORITY.

817
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:07,166
WHAT I PROPOSE
IS THAT I CIRCLE AROUND

818
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,500
TO THEIR REAR

819
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,875
WHILE YOU TWO PROVIDE
A FRONTAL ASSAULT.

820
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:12,750
IT SHOULD BE
SUFFICIENTLY VIOLENT

821
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,667
TO COVER WHATEVER I DO.

822
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:16,500
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

823
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,166
WHY, SLIP INTO THEIR CAMP
AND FREE HIM.

824
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:19,750
NO.

REMEMBER, I WAS

826
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,041
SOMETHING OF A BACKWOODSMAN.

827
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,709
I DOUBT THAT YOU COULD DO
WHAT I WAS BRED TO.

828
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:28,709
I CAN'T LET YOU
RISK IT, MR. PRESIDENT.

829
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:31,291
WELL, I AM

830
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,333

ANY COMMENT?

HELP ME, SPOCK!

832
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,417
NO, SIR.

833

WE MATCH THEIR EVIL.

837
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:52,709
I KNOW, JAMES.

838
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:54,917

[LEAVES RUSTLING]

870
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,792
MR. LINCOLN.

871
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:50,917
JAMES, STAY BACK.

872
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:22,542
YOU ARE THE SURVIVORS.

873
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:25,083
THE OTHERS HAVE RUN OFF.

874
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,417
IT WOULD SEEM THAT
EVIL RETREATS

875
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,583
WHEN FORCIBLY CONFRONTED.

876
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:32,000
HOWEVER, YOU HAVE FAILED
TO DEMONSTRATE TO ME

877
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,959
ANY OTHER DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOUR PHILOSOPHIES.

878
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,333
YOUR GOOD AND YOUR EVIL
USE THE SAME METHODS,

879
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:40,291
ACHIEVE THE SAME RESULTS.

880
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:42,083
DO YOU HAVE
AN EXPLANATION?

881
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,583
YOU ESTABLISHED
THE METHODS AND THE GOALS.

882
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:46,667
FOR YOU TO USE
AS YOU CHOSE.

883
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,291
WHAT DID YOU OFFER
THE OTHERS IF THEY WON?

884
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:50,333
WHAT THEY WANTED MOST:

885
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,542
POWER.

886
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:55,583
YOU OFFERED ME...

887
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,375
THE LIVES OF MY CREW.

888
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:59,583
I PERCEIVE.

889
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,625
YOU HAVE WON
THEIR LIVES.

890
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:05,041
HOW MANY OTHERS
HAVE YOU DONE THIS TO?

891
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:08,375
WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO HAND OUT LIFE AND DEATH?

892
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:11,000
THE SAME RIGHT
THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE:

893
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,291
THE NEED TO KNOW
NEW THINGS.

894
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:16,667
WE CAME IN PEACE.

895
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,625

IN PEACE.

CAPTAIN? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

898
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:37,333
YES, MR. SULU.
WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

YOU MAY BEAM US
ABOARD.

900
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:46,709
MR. SCOTT.
REPORT.

901
00:47:46,709 --> 00:47:48,750
THE SHIP IS FUNCTIONING
NORMALLY AGAIN, SIR,

902
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,834
AND THE RESTART CYCLE
IS IN OPERATION.

903
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,333
YOU'D NEVER KNOW
THAT ANYTHING HAD BEEN
OUT OF ORDER.

904
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:53,166
I CAN'T FATHOM IT.

905
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:54,583
MR. SULU.

906
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,500
WE SHOULD BE ON WARP POWER
WITHIN 30 MINUTES, SIR.

907
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,500
GOOD. MR. CHEKOV?

908
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,792
THE DETERIORATION
OF THE SHIELDING
HAS STOPPED, SIR,

909
00:48:00,792 --> 00:48:02,709
AND IS REVERSING ITSELF.
I HAVE NO EXPLANATION.

910
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:03,709
THANK YOU,
MR. CHEKOV.

911
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:10,834
MR. SPOCK,
ANY EXPLANATION?

912
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:14,083
CONJECTURE, CAPTAIN,
RATHER THAN EXPLANATION.

913
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:15,166
WELL?

914
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:16,500
IT WOULD SEEM
THAT WE WERE HELD
IN THE POWER

915
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,375
OF CREATURES ABLE
TO CONTROL MATTER

916
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:20,792
AND TO REARRANGE
MOLECULES

917
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:23,000
IN WHATEVER FASHION
WAS DESIRED,

918
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,458
SO THEY WERE
ABLE TO CREATE

919
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:26,959
IMAGES OF SURAK
AND LINCOLN

920
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:29,000
AFTER SCANNING
OUR MINDS

921
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,458
AND USING THEIR
FELLOW CREATURES

922
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:31,583
AS SOURCE MATTER.

923
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,792
THEY SEEMED SO REAL.

924
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:38,333
AND TO ME,
ESPECIALLY
MR. LINCOLN.

925
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:41,959
I FEEL I ACTUALLY
MET LINCOLN.

926
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:45,583
YES, AND SURAK.

927
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:48,834
PERHAPS IN A SENSE,
THEY WERE REAL, CAPTAIN.

928
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:51,208
SINCE THEY WERE CREATED
OUT OF OUR OWN THOUGHTS,

929
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:52,417
HOW COULD THEY BE
ANYTHING

930
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:54,375
BUT WHAT WE
EXPECTED THEM TO BE?

931
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:56,709
IT WAS SO HARD
FOR ME TO SEE HIM...

932
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,834
DIE AGAIN.

933
00:48:58,834 --> 00:49:00,166
I FEEL I UNDERSTAND

934
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:02,500
WHAT EARTH MUST HAVE
GONE THROUGH

935
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,667
TO ACHIEVE
FINAL PEACE.

936
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,667
Uhura: CAPTAIN KIRK,

937
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:08,792
THE PLANET HAS RESUMED
ITS NORMAL APPEARANCE.

938
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:18,834
THERE'S STILL SO MUCH
OF THEIR WORK TO BE DONE

939
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:20,333
IN THE GALAXY, SPOCK.

940
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,792
MR. SULU, BREAK US
OUT OF ORBIT

941
00:49:24,792 --> 00:49:27,542
AND CONTINUE
TO OUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT.

942
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:28,542
Sulu: AYE,
AYE, SIR.
