00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,866
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
MUST NOT BE TAKEN.

176
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,451
IF THE ROMULANS
ATTEMPT IT,

177
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,496
YOU'RE TO FIGHT,
AND IF NECESSARY,

178
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,997
DESTROY YOURSELVES.
IS THAT CLEAR?

179
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,624
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

180
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,548
ENERGIZE.

181
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,242
CAPTAIN KIRK.

182
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,495
COMMANDER...

183
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,539
I'M HONORED.

184
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,251
I DON'T THINK SO...

185
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,587
BUT WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT
MATTER TO DISCUSS.

186
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,424
AND YOUR SUPERFICIAL
COURTESIES

187
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,301
ARE AN OVERTURE
TO THAT DISCUSSION.

188
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,305
YOU ARE THE FIRST OFFICER?

189
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,975
SPOCK.

190
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,104
I SPEAK FIRST
WITH THE CAPTAIN.

191
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,940
YOU MAY WAIT OUTSIDE.

192
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,363
THE MATTER OF TRESPASS
INTO ROMULAN SPACE

193
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,739
IS ONE OF GALACTIC IMPORT,

194
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,658
A VIOLATION OF TREATIES.

195
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,620
NOW I ASK YOU SIMPLY,

196
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,205
WHAT IS
YOUR MISSION HERE?

197
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,498
INSTRUMENT FAILURE

198
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,832
CAUSED NAVIGATIONAL ERROR.

199
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,877
WE WERE ACROSS
THE NEUTRAL ZONE
BEFORE WE REALIZED IT,

200
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,254
THEN WE WERE SURROUNDED
BY YOUR SHIPS

201
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:29,921
BEFORE WE COULD
GET BACK.

202
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,132
A STARSHIP,

203
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,176
ONE OF THE STARFLEET'S
FINEST VESSELS?

204
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,554
YOU'RE SAYING
INSTRUMENT FAILURE

205
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,432
AS RADICAL AS YOU SUGGEST
WENT UNNOTICED

206
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,850
UNTIL YOU WERE
WELL PAST THE NEUTRAL ZONE?

207
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:43,518
ACCIDENTS CAN HAPPEN.

208
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,479
CUT OFF, BACKUP
SYSTEMS CAN MALFUNCTION.

209
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,813
WE WERE DUE FOR AN OVERHAUL
TWO MONTHS AGO.

210
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,356
I SEE.

211
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,900
BUT YOU WERE ABLE TO NAVIGATE
WITH THIS MALFUNCTION?

212
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,693
THE ERROR WAS CORRECTED.

213
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,238
BUT I DOUBT IT IT WILL
CLEAR YOU OF ESPIONAGE.

214
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,782
WE WERE NOT SPYING,
COMMANDER.

215
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,452
YOUR LANGUAGE HAS ALWAYS
BEEN MOST DIFFICULT
FOR ME, CAPTAIN.

216
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,621
PERHAPS YOU HAVE
ANOTHER WORD FOR IT.

217
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,915
YOU ARE GROSSLY MISTAKEN
IF YOU THINK THAT
WE WERE THERE TO--

218
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,961
CAPTAIN, IF A ROMULAN VESSEL
VENTURED FAR INTO
FEDERATION TERRITORY

219
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,963
WITHOUT GOOD EXPLANATION,

220
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,882
WHAT WOULD A STAR BASE
COMMANDER DO?

221
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,092
YOU SEE...

222
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,677
IT WORKS BOTH WAYS.

223
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,764
I HARDLY BELIEVE
YOU ARE THE INJURED PARTY.

224
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,312
SPOCK, COME IN.

225
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,949
THE CAPTAIN HAS MADE
HIS STATEMENT.

226
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,453
I UNDERSTAND.

227
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:48,375
I MUST ADMIT SOME SURPRISE
ON SEEING YOU, SPOCK.

228
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,586
WE WERE NOT AWARE
OF VULCANS ABOARD
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

229
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,629
STARFLEET
IS NOT IN THE HABIT

230
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,256
OF INFORMING ROMULANS
OF ITS SHIPS' PERSONNEL.

231
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:59,469
QUITE SO, YET THERE ARE
CERTAIN SHIPS...

232
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,054
CERTAIN OFFICERS...

233
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,349
THAT ARE KNOWN TO US.

234
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,351
YOUR SITUATION APPEARS
MOST INTERESTING.

235
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,019
WHAT EARNS SPOCK
YOUR SPECIAL INTEREST?

236
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,271
HE IS A VULCAN.

237
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,857
OUR FOREBEARS
HAD THE SAME ROOTS

238
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,526
AND ORIGINS.

239
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,277
SOMETHING YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND, CAPTAIN.

240
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,155
WE CAN APPRECIATE
THE VULCANS,

241
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,115
OUR DISTANT BROTHERS.

242
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,665
I HAVE HEARD
OF VULCAN INTEGRITY

243
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,376
AND PERSONAL HONOR.

244
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,087
THERE'S
A WELL-KNOWN SAYING--

245
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,256
OR IS IT A MYTH--

246
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,300
THAT VULCANS
ARE INCAPABLE OF LYING?

247
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,428
IT IS NO MYTH.

248
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,266
THEN TELL ME
TRUTHFULLY NOW,

249
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,810
BY YOUR HONOR
AS A VULCAN,

250
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,646
WHAT WAS YOUR MISSION?

251
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,981
I RESERVE THE PRIVILEGE
OF SPEAKING

252
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:58,612
ONLY WHEN IT WILL NOT
VIOLATE MY HONOR
AS A VULCAN.

253
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,407
IT IS UNWORTHY
OF A VULCAN

254
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,950
TO RESORT TO SUBTERFUGE.

255
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,244
YOU'RE BEING CLEVER,
COMMANDER.

256
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,829
THAT IS UNWORTHY
OF A ROMULAN.

257
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:13,585
IT IS NOT A LIE
TO KEEP THE TRUTH
TO ONESELF.

258
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,131
OH, THEN THERE IS
A TRUTH HERE

259
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,549
THAT REMAINS UNSPOKEN.

260
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,676
YOU'VE BEEN TOLD EVERYTHING.
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO SAY.

261
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,681
THERE IS MR. SPOCK'S
UNSPOKEN TRUTH.

262
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,142
YOU KNEW OF
THE CLOAKING DEVICE

263
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,727
THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED.

264
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,104
YOU DELIBERATELY
VIOLATED ROMULAN SPACE

265
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,898
WITH A BLATANT SPY MISSION,
BY ORDER OF THE FEDERATION--

266
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,109
WE'VE BEEN ALL THROUGH THAT,
COMMANDER.

267
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,611
WE HAVE NOT EVEN BEGUN!

268
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,993
THERE'S NO FORCE
THAT I CAN USE

269
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,120
ON A VULCAN

270
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,415
THAT WILL MAKE HIM SPEAK.

271
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,793
THAT IS A FACT.

272
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,504
BUT THERE ARE
ROMULAN METHODS

273
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:01,466
COMPLETELY EFFECTIVE
AGAINST HUMANS

274
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,967
AND HUMAN WEAKNESSES.

275
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,429
YOU WOULD NOT RESORT
TO THEM, COMMANDER.

276
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,974
THEY WOULD PROVE
INEFFECTIVE AGAINST
THE CAPTAIN.

277
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,602
THEN THEY WILL
LEAVE HIM DEAD...

278
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,438
OR WHAT MIGHT BE WORSE
THAN DEAD,

279
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,525
BUT I WILL KNOW
YOUR UNSPOKEN TRUTHS.

280
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,735
LET HER RANT.
THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY.

281
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,738
I CANNOT ALLOW THE CAPTAIN
TO BE FURTHER DESTROYED.

282
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,865
THE STRAIN OF COMMAND
HAS WORN HEAVILY UPON HIM.

283
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,033
HE HAS NOT BEEN HIMSELF
FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.

284
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,951
THAT'S A LIE!

285
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,204
AS YOU CAN SEE, CAPTAIN KIRK
IS A HIGHLY SENSITIVE

286
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,913
AND EMOTIONAL PERSON.

287
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,583
I BELIEVE HE HAS
LOST THE CAPACITY
FOR RATIONAL DECISION.

288
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:36,250
SHUT UP, SPOCK!

289
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,127
I AM BETRAYING NO SECRETS.

290
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,713
THE COMMANDER'S SUSPICION

291
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,798
THAT STARFLEET ORDERED
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

292
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,425
INTO THE NEUTRAL ZONE
IS UNACCEPTABLE.

293
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,387
OUR RAPID CAPTURE
DEMONSTRATES ITS FOOLHARDINESS.

294
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,722
YOU'RE A FILTHY LIAR!

295
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,348
I AM SPEAKING THE TRUTH,

296
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,226
FOR THE BENEFIT
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
AND THE FEDERATION.

297
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,354
I SAY NOW
AND FOR THE RECORD

298
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,524
THAT CAPTAIN KIRK
ORDERED THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
ACROSS THE NEUTRAL ZONE

299
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,777
ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE
AND HIS CRAVING FOR GLORY.

300
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,697
I'LL KILL YOU FOR THIS,
YOU TRAITOR!
I'LL KILL YOU!

301
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,868
I'LL KILL YOU!

302
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,952
HE IS NOT SANE.

303
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,718
ATTENTION,<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>
I AM SPEAKING TO YOU

304
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,511
FROM THE ROMULAN FLAGSHIP.

305
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,888
THE U.S.S.<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

306
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,432
UNDER COMMAND OF CAPTAIN
JAMES T. KIRK,

307
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,727
IS FORMALLY CHARGED
WITH ESPIONAGE.

308
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,145
THE TESTIMONY
OF FIRST OFFICER SPOCK

309
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,857
WAS HIGHLY INSTRUMENTAL
IN CONFIRMING

310
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,942
THIS INTRUSION
INTO ROMULAN SPACE

311
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,819
WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT.

312
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,530
FIRST OFFICER SPOCK'S
TESTIMONY WAS SPECIFIC

313
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,116
THAT YOUR SHIP WAS NOT
UNDER ORDERS

314
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,201
FROM STARFLEET COMMAND

315
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,870
OR THE FEDERATION COUNCIL

316
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,205
TO PERFORM
SUCH A SPY MISSION.

317
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,751
IT WAS CAPTAIN KIRK
WHO WAS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE.

318
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,587
SINCE THE CREW HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO OBEY ORDERS,

319
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,964
THE CREW WILL NOT
BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.

320
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,926
THEREFORE, I AM ORDERING
ENGINEER SCOTT,

321
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,427
PRESENTLY IN COMMAND
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

322
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,054
TO FOLLOW
THE ROMULAN FLAGSHIP

323
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,640
TO OUR HOME BASE.

324
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,058
YOU WILL THERE BE
PROCESSED AND RELEASED

325
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,435
TO FEDERATION COMMAND.

326
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,229
UNTIL JUDGMENT IS PASSED,

327
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,231
CAPTAIN KIRK WILL BE HELD

328
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,608
IN CONFINEMENT.

329
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,323
SECURITY, PUT OUR
TWO ROMULAN HOSTAGES
IN THE BRIG.

330
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:34,786
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
GIVE ME A CHANNEL
TO THAT SHIP.

331
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,123
THE CHANNEL IS OPEN,
MR. SCOTT,

332
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,709
AND YOU ARE TIED IN.

333
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,003
THIS IS
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER SCOTT.

334
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,089
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
TAKES NO ORDERS

335
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,300
EXCEPT THOSE
OF CAPTAIN KIRK.

336
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,051
AND WE WILL STAY
RIGHT HERE

337
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,304
UNTIL HE RETURNS.

338
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,556
AND IF YOU MAKE
ANY ATTEMPT TO BOARD

339
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,309
OR COMMANDEER
THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

340
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,727
IT WILL BE BLOWN TO BITS

341
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,397
ALONG WITH AS MANY OF YOU
AS WE CAN TAKE WITH US.

342
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,526
YOU HUMANS MAKE
A BRAVE NOISE.

343
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,570
THERE ARE WAYS
TO CONVINCE YOU
OF YOUR ERRORS.

344
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,404
[CLICK]

345
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,781
DID YOU HEAR THAT,
YOU COWARD?

346
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,575
YOU'VE BETRAYED EVERYTHING
OF VALUE YOU EVER KNEW.

347
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,369
DID YOU HEAR THE SOUND
OF HUMAN INTEGRITY?

348
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,205
TAKE HIM
TO THE SECURITY ROOM.

349
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,633
A VULCAN AMONG HUMANS...

350
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,969
LIVING,
WORKING WITH THEM...

351
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,430
I WOULD THINK
THE SITUATION WOULD BE
INTOLERABLE TO YOU.

352
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,724
I AM HALF VULCAN.

353
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,684
MY MOTHER
IS A HUMAN.

354
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,477
TO WHOM IS YOUR
ALLEGIANCE, THEN?

355
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,981
DO YOU CALL YOURSELF
TERRAN OR VULCAN?

356
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,649
VULCAN.

357
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,781
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
A STARFLEET OFFICER, SPOCK?

358
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,324
18 YEARS.

359
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,326
AND YOU SERVE CAPTAIN KIRK.

360
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,786
DO YOU LIKE HIM?

361
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,413
DO YOU LIKE
YOUR SHIPMATES?

362
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,499
THE QUESTION
IS IRRELEVANT.

363
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,795
POSSIBLY.
BUT YOU ARE SUBORDINATE
TO CAPTAIN KIRK'S ORDERS,

364
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,714
EVEN TO HIS WHIMS.

365
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,341
MY DUTY AS AN OFFICER
IS TO OBEY HIM.

366
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,680
YOU ARE A SUPERIOR BEING.

367
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,058
WHY DO YOU NOT COMMAND?

368
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,311
I DO NOT DESIRE
A SHIP OF MY OWN.

369
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,774
OR IS IT THAT NO ONE
HAS OFFERED YOU, A VULCAN,

370
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,275
THAT OPPORTUNITY?

371
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,654
SUCH OPPORTUNITIES
ARE EXTREMELY RARE.

372
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,199
FOR SOMEONE
WITH YOUR CAPABILITIES
AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS,

373
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,327
OPPORTUNITIES ARE MADE...

374
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,579
AND WILL BE.

375
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,497
I WILL SEE TO THAT,

376
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,207
IF YOU WILL STOP LOOKING
ON THE FEDERATION

377
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,626
AS THE WHOLE UNIVERSE.

378
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,711
IT IS NOT, YOU KNOW.

379
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:54,634
THAT THOUGHT
HAS OCCASIONALLY
CROSSED MY MIND.

380
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,434
YOU MUST HAVE
YOUR OWN SHIP.

381
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,437
COMMANDER, SHALL WE
SPEAK PLAINLY?

382
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,900
IT IS YOU
WHO DESPERATELY
NEED A SHIP.

383
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,778
YOU WANT
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

384
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,783
OF COURSE.

385
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,119
IT WOULD BE
A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT FOR ME

386
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,704
TO BRING HOME
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> INTACT.

387
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,207
IT WOULD BROADEN THE SCOPE
OF MY POWERS GREATLY.

388
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,544
IT WOULD BE THE ACHIEVEMENT
OF A LIFETIME.

389
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,091
AND IT WOULD OPEN
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU.

390
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,565
AAH!

391
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,574
Uhura:
BRIDGE TO DR. McCOY.

392
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,077
McCOY HERE.

393
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,788
DOCTOR, YOU MUST BEAM ABOARD
THE ROMULAN FLAGSHIP
IMMEDIATELY.

394
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,373
THERE'S BEEN AN INJURY.

395
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,249
I DON'T
MAKE HOUSE CALLS.

396
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,085
DOCTOR, IT'S CAPTAIN KIRK!

397
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,145
HE'LL RECOVER, BUT HE'LL NEED
FURTHER ATTENTION.

398
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,980
INFORM YOUR SUPERIOR.

399
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,570
[BEEPING]

400
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,532
YES?

401
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,785
I'LL COME THERE.

402
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,580
ATTEND ME.

403
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,131
I NEGLECTED TO MENTION,
I'LL EXPECT YOU FOR DINNER.

404
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,010
WE HAVE MUCH TO DISCUSS.

405
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,428
INDEED?

406
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,769
ALLOW ME TO--TO REPHRASE.

407
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,355
WILL YOU JOIN ME
FOR DINNER?

408
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,692
I AM HONORED,
COMMANDER.

409
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,445
ARE THE GUARDS
ALSO INVITED?

410
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,627
MR. SPOCK...

411
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:41,092
THAT CORRIDOR
IS FORBIDDEN TO ALL
BUT LOYAL ROMULANS.

412
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,303
OF COURSE.

413
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,388
I SHALL OBEY
YOUR RESTRICTIONS.

414
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,516
I HOPE THAT ONE DAY

415
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:53,104
THERE WILL BE NO NEED
FOR YOU TO OBSERVE

416
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,105
ANY RESTRICTIONS.

417
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,066
IT WOULD BE ILLOGICAL

418
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,318
TO ASSUME THAT
ALL CONDITIONS

419
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,445
REMAIN STABLE.

420
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,343
ARE YOU THE DOCTOR?

421
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,428
McCOY.

422
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,346
CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER.

423
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,599
CAPTAIN KIRK'S CONDITION?

424
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,268
WELL, YOU CAN SEE
FOR YOURSELF,

425
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,146
HE'S MENTALLY DEPRESSED,
PHYSICALLY WEAK,

426
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,856
DISORIENTED,

427
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,608
DISPLAYS FEELINGS
OF PERSECUTION
AND REBELLION.

428
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,986
THEN BY YOUR OWN STANDARDS
OF NORMALITY,

429
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,863
THIS MAN IS NOT
FULLY COMPETENT.

430
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,032
NO, NOT NOW.

431
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,616
MR. SPOCK HAS STATED

432
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,369
THAT HE BELIEVES
THE CAPTAIN HAD NO AUTHORITY

433
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,372
OR ORDER TO CROSS
THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

434
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,251
COULD THIS MENTAL
INCAPACITY

435
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,836
HAVE AFFLICTED HIM
EARLIER?

436
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,921
YES, IT'S POSSIBLE.

437
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:07,594
MR. SPOCK, THE DOCTOR
HAS NOW CONFIRMED
YOUR TESTIMONY

438
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,890
AS TO THE MENTAL STATE
OF YOUR CAPTAIN.

439
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:14,810
HE WAS AND IS UNFIT
TO CONTINUE IN COMMAND
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

440
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,188
THAT DUTY HAS NOW
FALLEN ON YOU.

441
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,857
ARE YOU READY
TO EXERCISE THAT FUNCTION?

442
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,067
I AM READY.

443
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,318
SPOCK, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

444
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,278
THERE'S NO PRICE
YOU COULD PAY

445
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,030
THAT WOULD MAKE HIM
SELL OUT.

446
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,866
THE MATTER IS NOT
OPEN FOR DISCUSSION,
DOCTOR.

447
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,117
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THE MATTER'S NOT OPEN FOR--

448
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,578
THAT'S ENOUGH, DOCTOR.

449
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,539
AS A PHYSICIAN, YOUR DUTY
IS TO SAVE LIVES.

450
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,666
MR. SPOCK'S DUTY

451
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,627
IS TO LEAD THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
AND ITS CREW

452
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,213
TO A SAFE HAVEN.

453
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,797
THERE IS NO
ALTERNATIVE, DOCTOR.

454
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,217
THE SAFETY
OF THE CREW IS NOW
THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE.

455
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,886
IT IS MISGUIDED LOYALTY
TO RESIST ANY FURTHER.

456
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,055
YOU TRAITOR.

457
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,598
I'LL KILL YOU.

458
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,726
I'LL KILL YOU.

459
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,853
I'LL KILL YOU!

460
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,156
WHAT DID YOU DO?

461
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,535
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

462
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,706
I WAS UNPREPARED
FOR HIS ATTACK.

463
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,794
I INSTINCTIVELY USED
THE VULCAN DEATH GRIP.

464
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,716
YOUR INSTINCTS ARE
STILL GOOD, MR. SPOCK.

465
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,804
THE CAPTAIN IS DEAD.

466
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,886
DOCTOR! DR. McCOY!

467
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,555
DR. McCOY!

468
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,557
I LEFT ORDERS THAT
NO ONE WAS TO COME IN HERE.

469
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,268
BUT HE'S ALIVE!
ALIVE!

470
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,645
WELL, NOW THAT YOU KNOW IT,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL ASSIST ME.

471
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,230
HAND ME
THE PHYSIO-STIMULATOR.

472
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,607
BUT HE WAS DEAD.
BUT THEIR DOCTORS
CERTIFIED HE WAS DEAD.

473
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,526
SPOCK GAVE HIM
A NERVE PINCH
TO SIMULATE DEATH.

474
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,446
THEN MR. SPOCK
ISN'T A TRAITOR,

475
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,406
AND YOU KNEW THAT
ALL THE TIME
AND YOU DIDN'T--

476
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,034
I DIDN'T KNOW IT
UNTIL I BEAMED ABOARD
THE ROMULAN SHIP.

477
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,246
JIM AND SPOCK WERE OPERATING
UNDER FEDERATION ORDERS.

478
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,887
OHH...

479
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,265
OHH.

480
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,062
MY NECK FEELS LIKE
IT'S BEEN TWISTED OFF.

481
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,814
THAT'S THE VULCAN
DEATH GRIP FOR YOU.

482
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,067
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A VULCAN DEATH GRIP.

483
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,610
AH, BUT THE ROMULANS
DON'T KNOW THAT.

484
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,071
SURE FOOLED
THE DOCTORS.

485
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,698
YOU TOOK A BIG CHANCE
THAT THEY DIDN'T START
AN AUTOPSY.

486
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,659
AS FAR AS THE REST OF
THE CREW IS CONCERNED,

487
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,161
I'M STILL DEAD.

488
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,829
WHY?

489
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,123
THAT'S WHAT THIS WHOLE
MASQUERADE WAS ABOUT--

490
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:27,336
TO KEEP THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
AND THE FEDERATION
OFF THE HOOK.

491
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,339
SO THAT IF
ANYTHING WENT WRONG,

492
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,590
YOU WOULD BE
THE ONE TO BLAME.

493
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:37,054
BONES, I WANT YOU
TO PREPARE FOR SURGERY.

494
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,473
WHAT FOR?

495
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,140
[INTERCOM WHISTLES]

496
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,059
SICK BAY TO BRIDGE.

497
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,643
SCOTT HERE, DOCTOR.

498
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,146
MR. SCOTT, WILL YOU
REPORT TO SICK BAY.

499
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:49,442
SICK BAY?
I CAN'T LEAVE THE BRIDGE
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

500
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,943
YOU HAVE TO.
IT'S URGENT.

501
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:54,405
WE'RE SURROUNDED
BY ENEMY VESSELS
READY TO ATTACK US.

502
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,740
I DON'T KNOW OF ANYTHING
MORE URGENT THAN THAT.

503
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,367
WELL, I DO.

504
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,327
MR. SCOTT, PLEASE.

505
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,204
ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR.

506
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,415
IT BETTER BE IMPORTANT.

507
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,583
SCOTT OUT.

508
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,257
ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR,
WHAT'S SO URGENT THAT--

509
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,265
CAPTAIN?

510
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,895
CAPTAIN KIRK.

511
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:28,981
YES.

512
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,317
WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE
THE DEVIL HIMSELF,

513
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,110
BUT AS LONG AS
YOU'RE ALIVE.

514
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,946
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?

515
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,491
ARE THOSE ROMULAN OFFICERS
STILL ABOARD THE SHIP?

516
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,534
THEY'RE IN THE BRIG,
SIR.

517
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,411
I'LL NEED
A ROMULAN UNIFORM.

518
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,037
AH...

519
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:44,913
AYE.

520
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,249
IT'LL BE A PLEASURE.

521
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:05,100
I'VE HAD SPECIAL VULCAN DISHES
PREPARED FOR YOU.

522
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,645
I HOPE THEY'RE TO YOUR LIKING.

523
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,855
I AM VERY FLATTERED,
COMMANDER.

524
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,108
THERE'S NO DOUBT
THAT THE CUISINE
ABOARD YOUR VESSEL

525
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:17,737
IS FAR SUPERIOR TO
THAT OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

526
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,991
IT IS, INDEED,

527
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,244
A VERY POWERFUL
RECRUITING INDUCEMENT.

528
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,666
WE HAVE OTHER
INDUCEMENTS.

529
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,735
WHAT THE DEVIL
IS SPOCK DOING?

530
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,654
WHAT'S DELAYING HIM?

531
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,614
I WISH I KNEW.

532
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,117
SCOTTY, ARE YOU SURE

533
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,994
WE HAVE A CLEAR CHANNEL
TO SPOCK?

534
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,538
AYE, SIR.
NO DOUBT OF IT.

535
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,664
THEN WE CAN'T WAIT
ANY LONGER.

536
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,874
PREPARE TO BEAM ME
ABOARD THE FLAGSHIP.

537
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,959
BUT MR. SPOCK HASN'T SENT
THE PROPER COORDINATES.

538
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,545
IT CAN'T BE HELPED, SCOTTY.

539
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,629
YOU'RE TAKING
AN AWFUL CHANCE, JIM.

540
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,883
JUST DON'T PUT ME
INSIDE A BULKHEAD. ENERGIZE.

541
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,607
CENTURION, I'M SORRY.
NO ONE IS ALLOWED--

542
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,900
I HAVE JUST EFFECTED AN ESCAPE
FROM A FEDERATION VESSEL.

543
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,319
I HAVE IMPORTANT INFORMATION
FOR SUBCOMMANDER TAL.
WHERE IS HE?

544
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,696
HE IS IN CONTROL CENTRAL,
CENTURION.

545
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,531
GOOD. I SHALL REMEMBER
TO MENTION
YOUR ALERTNESS TO HIM.

546
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:43,990
RETURN TO YOUR DUTY.

547
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,867
THANK YOU,
CENTURION.

548
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,021
YOU HAVE NOTHING
IN STARFLEET

549
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,232
TO WHICH TO RETURN.

550
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,568
I OFF--

551
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,615
WE...

552
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,118
OFFER YOU
AN ALTERNATIVE.

553
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,079
WE WILL FIND
A PLACE FOR YOU,

554
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,040
IF YOU WISH IT.

555
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,752
A PLACE?

556
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,253
MM-HMM.

557
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:40,631
WITH ME.

558
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:50,015
ROMULAN WOMEN ARE NOT
LIKE VULCAN FEMALES.

559
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,059
WE ARE NOT
DEDICATED TO...

560
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,020
PURE LOGIC

561
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,606
AND THE STERILITY
OF NON-EMOTION.

562
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,742
OUR PEOPLE ARE WARRIORS.

563
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,328
OFTEN SAVAGE.

564
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,873
BUT WE ARE ALSO
MANY OTHER PLEASANT THINGS.

565
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:23,882
I WAS NOT AWARE
OF THAT ASPECT
OF ROMULAN SOCIETY.

566
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,929
AS A VULCAN,
YOU WILL STUDY IT.

567
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,892
AS A HUMAN,
YOU WOULD FIND WAYS
TO APPRECIATE IT.

568
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,404
PLEASE BELIEVE ME.

569
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,988
I DO...

570
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,574
APPRECIATE IT.

571
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,870
I AM SO GLAD.

572
00:31:55,873 --> 00:32:00,960
NOW, ONE FINAL STEP
TO MAKE THE OCCASION COMPLETE.

573
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,672
YOU WILL LEAD
A SMALL PARTY OF ROMULANS

574
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,632
ABOARD THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

575
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:08,093
AND THERE YOU WILL TAKE
YOUR RIGHTFUL PLACE

576
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,387
AS ITS COMMANDER,

577
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:14,391
AND YOU WILL LEAD THE SHIP
TO A ROMULAN PORT,

578
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,060
WITH MY FLAGSHIP
AT ITS SIDE.

579
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,023
YES, OF COURSE.

580
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:25,611
BUT NOT
JUST THIS MOMENT.

581
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:29,155
AN HOUR FROM NOW
WILL DO...

582
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,031
EVEN BETTER.

583
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:34,035
WOULD IT NOT...

584
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,871
COMMANDER?

585
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,248
YES.

586
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,419
YES, IT WILL...

587
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,254
MR. SPOCK.

588
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,550
YOU DO KNOW
I HAVE A FIRST NAME.

589
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,805
I WAS BEGINNING
TO WONDER.

590
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,348
WELL, I DO.

591
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,601
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HEAR IT?

592
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,278
HOW RARE...

593
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,280
AND HOW BEAUTIFUL...

594
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,993
BUT SO INCONGRUOUS

595
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,663
WHEN SPOKEN BY
A SOLDIER.

596
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,460
IF YOU WILL
GIVE ME A MOMENT,

597
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:28,381
THE SOLDIER WILL
TRANSFORM HERSELF...

598
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,801
INTO A WOMAN.

599
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,363
SPOCK TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

600
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,614
KIRK HERE.

601
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,575
CAPTAIN, ARE YOU PREPARED
TO BEAM OVER?

602
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,327
I'M ALREADY ON BOARD, SPOCK.

603
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,704
DO YOU HAVE
THE INFORMATION?

604
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,079
YES, CAPTAIN.

605
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,375
THE CLOAKING DEVICE
IS IN AN AREA NEAR
THE COMMANDER'S QUARTERS.

606
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,626
IT IS CLOSELY GUARDED

607
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,629
AND OFF-LIMITS TO ALL
BUT AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL.

608
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,464
WHAT IS
YOUR PRESENT LOCATION?

609
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,634
SUBCOMMANDER TAL,
I'M RECEIVING
AN ALIEN TRANSMISSION

610
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,135
FROM WITHIN
OUR VESSEL, SIR.

611
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,094
ALIEN?
ARE YOU CERTAIN?

612
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,137
YES, SUBCOMMANDER.

613
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,056
I MUST KNOW THE SOURCE!

614
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,683
TRIANGULATING NOW, SIR.

615
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,810
SPOCK, I'LL GET
THE CLOAKING DEVICE.

616
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,104
WILL YOU BE ABLE TO GET
BACK TO THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

617
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,606
WITHOUT ATTRACTING
THEIR ATTENTION?

618
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,317
UNKNOWN, CAPTAIN.

619
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,862
AT PRESENT,
I AM RATHER HEAVILY--

620
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,203
IS MY...

621
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,040
ATTIRE NOW
MORE APPROPRIATE...

622
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,875
MR. SPOCK?

623
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,671
COMMANDER, YOUR ATTIRE IS
NOT ONLY MORE APPROPRIATE,

624
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:54,885
IT SHOULD ACTUALLY
STIMULATE OUR CONVERSATION.

625
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,122
CENTURION,
HAVE YOU CLEARANCE
FOR THIS AREA?

626
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,916
I DO NOT
RECOGNIZE YOU.

627
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,333
THERE'S AN INTRUDER
ABOARD.

628
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,585
HAS SOMEONE TRIED
TO GAIN ENTRANCE THERE?

629
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,879
OVER THERE!
I MUST SEE
YOUR AUTHORIZATION--

630
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:43,349
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE...

631
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,352
THAT I CAN BE
SO MOVED...

632
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,230
BY THE TOUCH
OF AN ALIEN HAND.

633
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:54,027
I MUST CONFESS
THAT I, TOO...

634
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,739
AM MOVED EMOTIONALLY.

635
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,742
I KNOW IT IS ILLOGICAL.

636
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,620
MR. SPOCK...

637
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:09,250
WE MUSTN'T QUESTION
WHAT WE TRULY FEEL.

638
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,422
ACCEPT WHAT IS HAPPENING
BETWEEN US,

639
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,049
EVEN AS I DO.

640
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,050
[BEEP]

641
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,384
COMMANDER.

642
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,136
[BEEP]

643
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,429
PERMISSION
TO ENTER.

644
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,016
NOT NOW, TAL.

645
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,267
IT IS URGENT,
COMMANDER.

646
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,236
ENTER.

647
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:41,074
COMMANDER,
WE HAVE INTERCEPTED
AN ALIEN TRANSMISSION.

648
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,035
LOCATE ITS SOURCE.

649
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,911
WE HAVE, COMMANDER.

650
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,245
THIS ROOM.

651
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,423
THE CLOAKING DEVICE.

652
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,884
BRING HIM.

653
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:18,987
HALT.

654
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,073
DON'T MOVE.

655
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,825
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

656
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,451
THERE'S AN ENEMY SPY
ABOARD.

657
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,413
HE'LL BE AFTER
THE CLOAKING DEVICE.

658
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,250
DROP YOUR WEAPON.

659
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,044
SCOTTY...

660
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,879
ENERGIZE.

661
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,600
BUT, SIR,
WHAT ABOUT MR. SPOCK?

662
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,145
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO HOPE
HE CAN BUY US TIME

663
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,520
TO GET THIS CLOAKING
DEVICE INSTALLED.

664
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,481
IT'LL HAVE TO BE HOOKED IN
TO OUR DEFLECTOR SHIELD CONTROL.

665
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:37,232
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.
CAN YOU DO IT?

666
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,651
YOU HAVE 15 MINUTES,
SCOTTY.

667
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,410
COMMANDER, THE CLOAKING
DEVICE IS GONE.

668
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,078
FULL ALERT.

669
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,247
SEARCH ALL DECKS.

670
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,628
THAT WILL BE PROFITLESS,
COMMANDER.

671
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,965
I DO NOT BELIEVE
YOU WILL FIND IT.

672
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,051
YOU MUST BE MAD.

673
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,053
I ASSURE YOU...

674
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:10,015
I AM QUITE SANE.

675
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,018
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

676
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:16,229
WHAT ARE YOU
THAT YOU COULD DO THIS?

677
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:23,945
FIRST OFFICER...

678
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,239
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

679
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,584
WHAT IS YOUR PRESENT
FORM OF EXECUTION?

680
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:58,271
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 5027.4.</i>

681
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,647
<i>COMMANDER SCOTT</i>
<i>HAS LESS THAN 15 MINUTES</i>

682
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,108
<i>TO INSTALL THE ROMULAN'S</i>
<i>CLOAKING DEVICE</i>

683
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,069
<i>AND GET IT WORKING.</i>

684
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:07,030
<i>I HOPE MR. SPOCK CAN</i>
<i>BUY US THE TIME WE NEED.</i>

685
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:07,947
CAPTAIN!

686
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,032
YOU'RE ALIVE!

687
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,367
THEY SAID
YOU'D BEEN KILLED, SIR.

688
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,826
THE REPORT WAS PREMATURE.

689
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,870
CAPTAIN, YOUR EARS.
WHAT HAPPENED?

690
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,121
WE'LL DISCUSS IT LATER.

691
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,539
MR. SULU,
LAY IN A COURSE FOR HOME.

692
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,041
MR. CHEKOV,
TAKE THE SENSORS.

693
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,959
MR. SPOCK IS STILL ABOARD
THE ROMULAN FLAGSHIP.

694
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,629
I WANT HIS BODY READINGS
PINPOINTED AND ISOLATED.

695
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,174
THAT WAS NOT A REQUEST,
GENTLEMEN.

696
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,175
AYE, SIR.

697
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,176
AYE, SIR.

698
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,928
AYE, SIR.

699
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,642
RETURN TO YOUR STATION,
SUBCOMMANDER.

700
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,353
THE BOARDING ACTION
ON THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

701
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,355
WILL BEGIN
WITH MY COMMAND.

702
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,900
IF THEY RESIST,
DESTROY HER.

703
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,117
EXECUTION
OF STATE CRIMINALS

704
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:56,537
IS BOTH PAINFUL
AND UNPLEASANT.

705
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,665
I BELIEVE THE DETAILS
ARE UNNECESSARY.

706
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,127
THE SENTENCE
WILL BE CARRIED OUT

707
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,754
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CHARGES
HAVE BEEN RECORDED.

708
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,174
I DEMAND THE RIGHT
OF STATEMENT FIRST.

709
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:13,596
YOU UNDERSTAND
ROMULAN TRADITION WELL.

710
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,889
THE RIGHT IS GRANTED.

711
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,557
THANK YOU.

712
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,856
I SHALL NOT REQUIRE
MUCH TIME,

713
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,650
NO MORE THAN...

714
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,485
20 MINUTES,
I SHOULD SAY.

715
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,862
IT SHOULD TAKE
LESS TIME THAN THAT

716
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:33,241
TO FIND YOUR ALLY WHO
STOLE THE CLOAKING DEVICE.

717
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,535
YOU WILL NOT DIE ALONE.

718
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:43,126
RECORDING THE ROMULAN
RIGHT OF STATEMENT.

719
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,129
PROCEED, COMMANDER SPOCK.

720
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,089
MY CRIME IS SABOTAGE.

721
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,508
I FREELY ADMIT MY GUILT.

722
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,064
THE OATH I SWORE
AS A STARFLEET OFFICER

723
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,359
IS BOTH SPECIFIC
AND BINDING.

724
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:10,111
AS LONG AS I
WEAR THE UNIFORM,

725
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,071
MY DUTY IS TO PROTECT

726
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,073
THE SECURITY
OF THE FEDERATION.

727
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,659
CLEARLY, YOUR
NEW CLOAKING DEVICE

728
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,287
IS A THREAT
TO THAT SECURITY.

729
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,997
I CARRIED OUT MY DUTY.

730
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,082
EVERYONE
CARRIES OUT HIS DUTY.

731
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,751
YOU STATE THE OBVIOUS,
SPOCK.

732
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,588
THERE IS NO REGULATION
REGARDING THE CONTENT
OF MY STATEMENT.

733
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:30,923
MAY I CONTINUE?

734
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,842
VERY WELL.

735
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,387
YOUR 20 MINUTES
IS ALMOST UP.

736
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:38,097
MR. CHEKOV,
THERE'S ONLY ONE VULCAN
ABOARD THAT SHIP.

737
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,725
HE SHOULD BE EASY ENOUGH
TO LOCATE.

738
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,478
ROMULANS AND VULCANS APPEAR
TO READ ALMOST EXACTLY ALIKE.

739
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,938
THERE IS JUST
A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE WHICH--

740
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,316
GOT HIM, SIR.

741
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,693
FEED THE COORDINATES
TO THE TRANSPORTER ROOM
ON THE DOUBLE.

742
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,988
HAVE THEM PREPARE TO BEAM
HIM ABOARD ON MY SIGNAL.

743
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,073
CAPTAIN KIRK,

744
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,909
MR. SCOTT IS ON THE INTERCOM
FOR YOU, SIR.

745
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:58,451
GO AHEAD, SCOTTY.

746
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,661
I'VE GOT THAT DEVICE
INSTALLED,

747
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,373
BUT BLESS ME
IF I KNOW WHETHER
IT'S GOING TO WORK.

748
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,124
IT'S THE BIGGEST GUESS
I'VE EVER MADE.

749
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,709
STAND BY, SCOTTY.

750
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,169
SIR, TRANSPORTER ROOM
HAS THE COORDINATES

751
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,089
AND IS READY
FOR BEAMING.

752
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,926
TRANSPORTER ROOM,
BEAM MR. SPOCK ABOARD.

753
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:18,513
BEYOND
THE HISTORIC TRADITION
OF VULCAN LOYALTY,

754
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,890
THERE IS ALSO
THE COMBINED
ROMULAN-VULCAN HISTORY

755
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,350
OF OBEDIENCE TO DUTY.

756
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,105
TRANSPORTER ROOM REPORTS
MR. SPOCK ABOARD, SIR,

757
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,481
AND THE ROMULAN COMMANDER.

758
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,482
THE COMMANDER?

759
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,483
AYE, SIR.

760
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,734
HA HA! ALL RIGHT.

761
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,070
HAVE THEM REPORT TO
THE BRIDGE ON THE DOUBLE.

762
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:37,490
MR. SULU, TAKE US AWAY
FROM THE ROMULAN.

763
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,951
WARP FACTOR 9.

764
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,666
SUBCOMMANDER,
THE ENEMY VESSEL

765
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,086
IS MOVING AWAY
AT EXTREME SPEED, SIR.

766
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,796
ALERT ALL VESSELS.
WEAPONS OFFICER,

767
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:55,258
BRING MAIN BATTERIES TO
BEAR ON THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

768
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,430
HOLDING AT WARP 9, SIR.

769
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,058
SCOTTY, YOU BETTER
SWITCH ON THAT DEVICE.

770
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,311
I DID, SIR.

771
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:07,979
IT'S NOT WORKING.

772
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,235
I WOULD GIVE YOU
CREDIT, CAPTAIN,

773
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,487
FOR GETTING THIS FAR,

774
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:18,406
BUT YOU WILL BE DEAD
IN A MOMENT,

775
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,366
AND THE CREDIT
WOULD BE GRATUITOUS.

776
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,910
LIEUTENANT,
OPEN A CHANNEL TO
THE ROMULAN VESSEL.

777
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,662
AYE, SIR.

778
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,707
I HAVE
SUBCOMMANDER TAL, SIR.

779
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,627
ESTABLISH TWO-WAY
VISUAL CONTACT.

780
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,469
WE HAVE YOU UNDER
OUR WEAPONS,<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

781
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:40,512
YOU CANNOT ESCAPE.

782
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,097
THIS IS CAPTAIN KIRK.
HOLD YOUR FIRE.

783
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,682
WE HAVE YOUR COMMANDER
ABOARD.

784
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:45,850
COMMANDER?

785
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,059
DESTROY THIS VESSEL.

786
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,478
I GAVE YOU A DIRECT
COMMAND!

787
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:49,604
BREAK CONTACT!
TAL!

788
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,232
HELMSMAN, FLANK SPEED.

789
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:56,068
WEAPONS OFFICER, STAND BY
TO FIRE MAIN BATTERIES

790
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,695
AS SOON AS WE REACH
OPTIMUM RANGE.

791
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,407
SCOTTY, WE'RE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

792
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,742
CAPTAIN, I'M WORKING
AS FAST AS I CAN.

793
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,077
YOU SEE, CAPTAIN?

794
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,330
YOUR EFFORT
IS BEING WASTED.

795
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,084
MR. SPOCK, DISTANCE
FROM THE ROMULAN VESSEL?

796
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,671
150,000 KILOMETERS,
CAPTAIN,

797
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,297
AND CLOSING VERY RAPIDLY.

798
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,591
STAND BY, PHASERS.

799
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:21,927
COMMANDER, YOU'LL FORGIVE ME
IF I PUT UP A FIGHT.

800
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,013
OF COURSE.

801
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,057
IT'S EXPECTED.

802
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:27,475
100,000 KILOMETERS.

803
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,227
THEY SHOULD
COMMENCE FIRING AT US

804
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:33,105
WITHIN THE NEXT
12.7 SECONDS.

805
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,607
SCOTTY...

806
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,941
IT'S READY NOW,
CAPTAIN,

807
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,652
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER OUR CIRCUITS

808
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,195
CAN HANDLE THIS
ALIEN CONTRAPTION.

809
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,116
PULL THE SWITCH.

810
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,452
IT'LL LIKELY OVERLOAD.

811
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:47,537
THROW THE SWITCH.

812
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,586
WEAPONS OFFICER,
COMMENCE FI--

813
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,382
GONE.

814
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:00,717
THEY HAVE
THE CLOAKING DEVICE!

815
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,261
QUICKLY,
COMPUTE ENEMY COURSE
FROM LAST POSITION

816
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,096
YES, SIR.
AND OPEN FIRE!

817
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,098
MR. SULU, COME ABOUT.

818
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,516
318 MARK 7.

819
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,851
318 MARK 7, SIR.

820
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,353
EXECUTING.

821
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,452
THE CLOAKING DEVICE
IS WORKING PERFECTLY,

822
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,078
AND THE COMMANDER
HAS INFORMED ME

823
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,496
THAT EVEN
THE ROMULAN SENSORS

824
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:34,667
CANNOT TRACK A VESSEL
SO EQUIPPED.

825
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,961
THANK YOU,
MR. SPOCK.

826
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,592
CANCEL RED ALERT.

827
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:46,721
WE'LL LET YOU OFF
AT THE NEAREST
FEDERATION OUTPOST.

828
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,390
YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS,
CAPTAIN.

829
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,101
IF I MAY BE TAKEN
TO YOUR BRIG,

830
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,313
I WILL TAKE MY PLACE
AS YOUR PRISONER.

831
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:58,316
MR. SPOCK WILL HAVE
THE HONOR OF ESCORTING
YOU TO YOUR QUARTERS.

832
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:04,739
CAPTAIN.

833
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,325
COMMANDER.

834
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:19,587
DECK 2.

835
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:27,136
IT IS REGRETTABLE
THAT YOU WERE MADE
AN UNWILLING PASSENGER.

836
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,722
IT WAS NOT INTENTIONAL.

837
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:32,975
ALL THE FEDERATION WANTED
WAS THE CLOAKING DEVICE.

838
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,521
THE FEDERATION?

839
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,523
AND WHAT DID YOU WANT?

840
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,194
IT WAS MY ONLY INTEREST

841
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,571
WHEN I BOARDED
YOUR VESSEL.

842
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:48,741
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
ALL YOU CAME AWAY WITH.

843
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,330
YOU UNDERESTIMATE
YOURSELF, COMMANDER.

844
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,208
YOU REALIZE
THAT VERY SOON

845
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,084
WE WILL LEARN
TO PENETRATE

846
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,170
THE CLOAKING DEVICE
YOU STOLE.

847
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,172
OBVIOUSLY.

848
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,967
MILITARY SECRETS ARE
THE MOST FLEETING OF ALL.

849
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,096
I HOPE THAT YOU AND I

850
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:14,350
EXCHANGED SOMETHING
MORE PERMANENT.

851
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,618
IT WAS YOUR CHOICE.

852
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,706
IT WAS THE ONLY CHOICE
POSSIBLE.

853
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,625
YOU WOULD NOT RESPECT
ANY OTHER.

854
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,546
IT WILL BE OUR SECRET.

855
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,176
ENTERING NEUTRAL ZONE,
CAPTAIN.

856
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,095
VERY GOOD, MR. CHEKOV.

857
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,137
THANK YOU, MR. LESLIE.

858
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,930
SICK BAY TO BRIDGE.

859
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,182
WHAT IS IT, BONES?

860
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,975
IF ALL THE SHOUTING'S OVER
UP THERE,

861
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,103
I'D LIKE FOR YOU
TO REPORT TO SICK BAY.

862
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,062
WHAT FOR?

863
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,773
WELL, YOU'RE DUE IN SURGERY.

864
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:04,233
I'M GOING TO BOB YOUR EARS.

865
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,484
CAPTAIN...

866
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,943
PLEASE GO.

867
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:12,491
SOMEHOW THEY DO NOT LOOK
AESTHETICALLY AGREEABLE
ON HUMANS.

868
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,535
WELL, ARE YOU COMING, JIM,

869
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,245
OR DO YOU WANT
TO GO THROUGH LIFE

870
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,996
LOOKING LIKE
YOUR FIRST OFFICER?

871
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,998
I'M ON MY WAY.
