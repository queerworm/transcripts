Captain Kirk:<i> CAPTAIN'S LOG.</i>
<i>STAR DATE 5784.2</i>

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,846
<i>WE ARE RESPONDING</i>
<i>TO DESPERATE DISTRESS CALLS</i>

3
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,055
<i>FROM AN UNKNOWN PLANET.</i>

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,517
<i>MY SCIENCE OFFICER MR. SPOCK</i>
<i>IS UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS,</i>

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:19,520
<i>SINCE HE REPORTED NO SIGNS</i>
<i>OF LIFE ON THE PLANET.</i>

6
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,189
<i>IT IS RICH</i>
<i>IN KIRONIDE DEPOSITS--</i>

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,566
<i>A VERY RARE AND LONG-LASTING</i>
<i>SOURCE OF GREAT POWER.</i>

8
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:28,403
ARE YOU FROM
THE SPACESHIP<i> ENTERPRISE?</i>

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,033
THAT'S RIGHT.

10
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,542
ALEXANDER,
AT YOUR SERVICE.

11
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,126
I SING, I DANCE,

12
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,004
I PLAY ALL VARIETY
OF GAMES,

13
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,131
AND I'M A GOOD LOSER,
A VERY GOOD LOSER.

14
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,759
PLEASE, SIR, TRY TO
BEAR THAT IN MIND.

15
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,387
NOW, WOULD YOU PLEASE
ACCOMPANY ME?

16
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,056
WHO ARE THE INHABITANTS
OF THIS PLANET?

17
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,391
OH, PLATONIANS.

18
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,601
I'M SURE YOU'VE
NEVER HEARD OF US.

19
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,186
OUR NATIVE STAR
IS SAHNDARA.

20
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,439
MILLENNIA AGO,
JUST BEFORE IT WENT NOVA,
WE MANAGED TO ESCAPE.

21
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:08,402
OUR LEADER LIKED
PLATO'S IDEAS--
PLATO, PLATONIUS. SEE?

22
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,320
IN FACT, OUR PRESENT
PHILOSOPHER-KING, PARMEN,

23
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,406
SOMETIMES CALLS US
PLATO'S CHILDREN,

24
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,366
ALTHOUGH WE SOMETIMES
THINK OF OURSELVES

25
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,369
MORE AS PLATO'S
STEPCHILDREN.

26
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,831
EXCUSE ME. UH, SOMEONE'S
WAITING FOR YOU.

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,215
WELCOME
TO OUR REPUBLIC.

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,133
WHO AMONG YOU IS
THE PHYSICIAN?

29
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,510
I AM.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

30
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,096
MY SPOUSE. HIS LEG.
COME THIS WAY.

31
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,565
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT LEG?

32
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,276
I SUPPOSE I SCRATCHED IT.

33
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:53,196
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
ATTENDED TO IMMEDIATELY.

34
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,698
SHEER IGNORANCE.

35
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,992
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN DO?

36
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,244
WELL, WE'RE CERTAINLY
GOING TO TRY.

37
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,538
THE INFECTION
IS MASSIVE.

38
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,709
LET ME GIVE YOU A HYPO
TO EASE THE PAIN.

39
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,380
WHERE?

40
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,466
IN THE ARM.

41
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,520
PHILANA,
THEY CAME TO HELP.

42
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,316
THEY DESERVE BETTER
THAN TO DIE--ARGH!

43
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,611
ALEXANDER,
YOU TALK TOO MUCH.

44
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,339
<i>SPACE--</i>
<i>THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

45
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,180
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE.

46
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,018
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

47
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,770
<i>TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>STRANGE NEW WORLDS...</i>

48
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,898
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...</i>

49
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,486
<i>TO BOLDLY GO WHERE</i>
<i>NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.</i>

50
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,114
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG.</i>
<i>STAR DATE 5784.3.</i>

51
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,448
<i>DR. McCOY IS ENDEAVORING</i>
<i>TO TREAT THE LEADER</i>

52
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,617
<i>OF A STRANGE</i>
<i>GROUP OF PEOPLE.</i>

53
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,495
<i>WHEN THEIR PLANT NOVAED,</i>
<i>MILLENNIA AGO,</i>

54
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,497
<i>THEY TRANSPORTED THEMSELVES</i>
<i>TO EARTH</i>

55
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,500
<i>DURING THE TIME</i>
<i>OF SOCRATES AND PLATO.</i>

56
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,046
<i>AFTER THE DEATH OF THE GREEK</i>
<i>CIVILIZATION THEY IDOLIZED,</i>

57
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,423
<i>THEY CAME TO THIS PLANET</i>
<i>AND CREATED FOR THEMSELVES</i>

58
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,884
<i>A UTOPIA PATTERNED</i>
<i>AFTER IT.</i>

59
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,552
WHAT IS YOUR PROGNOSIS,
DOCTOR?

60
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,931
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN I HAVE THE RESULTS.

61
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,515
AND FROM NOW ON,

62
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,060
IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF I HANDLED THE INSTRUMENTS

63
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,145
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

64
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,735
BONES, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY A SIMPLE CUT LIKE THAT

65
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,319
COULD BECOME SO SERIOUS.

66
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,362
NEITHER DO I,
BUT IT HAS.

67
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,448
HOW DO I KNOCK OUT
AN INFECTION

68
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,950
WHEN THE TRICORDER
DOESN'T SHOW
ANY INFORMATION

69
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,743
ON PLATONIUS
BACTERIA?

70
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,913
ALL I CAN DO,
AND THIS IS GONNA
TAKE TIME,

71
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,208
IS TO TRY TO MATCH
HIS BUGS WITH A KNOWN
STRAIN AND HOPE.

72
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,838
YOUR PAN
IS IN JEOPARDY.

73
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,632
MM-HMM.

74
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,635
IT ISN'T NOW.

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,719
I WIN.

76
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,138
WELL PLAYED,
ERACLITUS.

77
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,473
I THANK YOU,
DIONYD.

78
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,144
THIS PSYCHOKINETIC
POWER OF YOURS...

79
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,020
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU HAD IT?

80
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,605
2 1/2--

81
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,566
EVER SINCE
OUR ARRIVAL
HERE ON PLATONIUS.

82
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,652
HOW IS THE POWER
TRANSMITTED?

83
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,487
BRAIN WAVES.

84
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,490
DO THESE WAVES CEASE
WHILE YOU ARE ASLEEP?

85
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,285
NO, NOT IF
THEY'RE EMBEDDED
IN THE UNCONSCIOUS.

86
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,577
WHAT ABOUT MEDICINE?

87
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,163
WHY NO DOCTORS?

88
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:33,083
WE HAVEN'T HAD
ANY PRESSING NEED
FOR THE MEDICAL ARTS.

89
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,709
YOU SEE,
WHILE STILL ON SAHNDARA,

90
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,045
WE INSTITUTED A MASS
EUGENICS PROGRAM.

91
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,338
WE ARE THE RESULT.

92
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,883
PARED DOWN TO
A POPULATION OF 38,

93
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,760
WE'RE PERFECT
FOR OUR UTOPIA.

94
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:48,932
WE'RE BRED
FOR CONTEMPLATION
AND SELF-RELIANCE...

95
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,349
AND LONGEVITY.

96
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,477
HOW OLD
WOULD YOU SAY I AM?

97
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,771
OH, DON'T BE AFRAID.
I'M NOT VAIN.

98
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,939
35.

99
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,525
THAT OLD?

100
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,570
I STOPPED AGING
AT 30.

101
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:07,868
WELL, ANYWAY,
YOU'RE OFF
BY 2,000 YEARS.

102
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:12,247
I'M 2,300 YEARS OLD.

103
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,791
WE WERE MARRIED
VERY YOUNG.

104
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,002
I WAS ONLY 117,

105
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,963
AND HE WAS 128.

106
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,590
SO YOU SEE,
WE SCARCELY HAVE TO
MOVE ANYMORE,

107
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,884
LET ALONE WORK.

108
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,593
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE
NO RESISTANCE?

109
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,970
THAT'S RIGHT.

110
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,847
A BREAK IN THE SKIN
OR A CUT
CAN BE FATAL.

111
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,807
UH...

112
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,019
UH...UH...

113
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,450
FASCINATING.

114
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,870
I BELIEVE
WE'RE EXPERIENCING

115
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,207
THE PSYCHOKINETIC
MANIFESTATIONS
OF PARMEN'S DELIRIUM.

116
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,792
UHH...

117
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,674
SCOTT TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

118
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,967
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

119
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,803
CAPTAIN,
WE'RE IN THE MIDST
OF A STORM.

120
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,513
NO DISCERNIBLE
CAUSE.

121
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,350
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

122
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,977
THERE'S 10-SCALE
TURBULENCE
RIGHT NOW.

123
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,856
EMERGENCY GYROS
AND STABILIZERS
AT MAXIMUM.

124
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,567
IF THIS
KEEPS UP, CAPTAIN,
WE CAN'T LAST!

125
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,027
ENGINES AT FULL SPEED.

126
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,946
GET HER OUT OF ORBIT
AND INTO SPACE.

127
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,155
I'VE TRIED THAT, SIR.

128
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,908
SHE'S LOCKED TIGHT.

129
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,035
THEN THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO BUT BATTEN
DOWN AND WEATHER.

130
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,954
RIGHT, CAPTAIN.

131
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,540
PARMEN'S MIND IS NOT--
WATCH IT!

132
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,167
HE'S NOT ONLY THROWING
AROUND THE FURNITURE,

133
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,752
HE'S TEARING UP THE
<i>ENTERPRISE</i> AS WELL.

134
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,255
BONES,
KNOCK HIM OUT FAST.

135
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,686
HELP!

136
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,605
SAVE ME!

137
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:05,777
ALEXANDER--

138
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,405
OH!

139
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,781
STAND BEHIND ME.

140
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,407
OW!

141
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,410
HIS MIND WILL
FIND ME ANYHOW.

142
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,535
OH!

143
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,955
DON'T SAVE HIM.
LET HIM DIE.

144
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,748
THE OTHERS WILL
KILL EACH OTHER

145
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,625
TRYING TO TAKE
HIS PLACE.

146
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,626
HURRY UP WITH THAT SHOT!

147
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,627
NOW, DOCTOR.

148
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,967
UH...
I CAN'T BREATHE.

149
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,511
I'M CHOKING...

150
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,141
BONES!

151
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,518
SHAKE HIM.
BREAK HIS CONCENTRATION.

152
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,483
AHH...

153
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,203
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

154
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,912
SCOTT ON
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

155
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,373
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
CAPTAIN.

156
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,790
THE TURBULENCE
HAS ABATED.

157
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,378
GOOD. I THINK YOU'LL
FIND THE ORBIT LOCK IS
BROKEN AS WELL.

158
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,962
ASSESS DAMAGE AND REPAIR
WHATEVER IS NECESSARY.

159
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,881
<i>AYE, CAPTAIN.</i>

160
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,757
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I CAN EVER
THANK YOU.

161
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,427
NOT ONLY
FOR PLATONIUS,
BUT FOR MYSELF.

162
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,970
NO THANKS IS NECESSARY.

163
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,390
ALEXANDER,
SHOW OUR GUESTS
TO THE SOUTH WING.

164
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,641
OH, THANK YOU. WE MUST
RETURN TO THE SHIP.

165
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,895
I THINK I BETTER
WAIT UNTIL THE
FEVER BREAKS.

166
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,815
WELL...IN THAT CASE,
WE'LL STAY.

167
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,868
ANYTHING YOU WANT,
JUST ASK ME.

168
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,370
ANYTHING.

169
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,371
THANK YOU,
ALEXANDER.

170
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,955
THINK NOTHING OF IT.
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

171
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,791
LISTEN,
I THINK I SHOULD
TELL YOU THAT--

172
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,001
TELL ME WHAT?

173
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:50,006
WELL, JUST THAT I
NEVER KNEW ANY PEOPLE
LIKE YOU EXISTED.

174
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,508
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

175
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,800
THEY'RE ALL
IN CHAMBERS...

176
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,219
MEDITATING.

177
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,471
ALEXANDER...

178
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:01,184
ARE THERE OTHER
PLATONIANS LIKE YOU?

179
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,270
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE ME?

180
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:07,315
WHO DON'T HAVE
THE PSYCHOKINETIC
ABILITY.

181
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,527
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT
MY SIZE...

182
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,947
BECAUSE THEY
MAKE FUN OF ME
FOR MY SIZE.

183
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,490
BUT, UM, TO ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION,

184
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,534
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO DOESN'T HAVE IT.

185
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,078
I WAS BROUGHT HERE
AS THE COURT
BUFFOON.

186
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,955
THAT'S WHY I'M
EVERYBODY'S SLAVE

187
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,582
AND I HAVE TO BE
10 PLACES AT ONCE

188
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,500
AND I NEVER DO
ANYTHING RIGHT.

189
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,502
HOW DOES ONE
OBTAIN THE POWER?

190
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,879
AS FAR AS I KNOW,
IT JUST COMES TO YOU

191
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,423
SOMETIME AFTER
YOU'RE BORN.

192
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,091
THEY SAY
I'M A THROWBACK,

193
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,969
AND I AM,
AND SO ARE YOU.

194
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,054
SORRY. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT.

195
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,180
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

196
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,349
WE'RE HAPPY WITHOUT IT.

197
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,272
YOU KNOW,
I BELIEVE YOU ARE.

198
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,442
LISTEN,
WHERE YOU COME FROM,

199
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:55,696
ARE THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WITHOUT THE POWER
AND MY SIZE?

200
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:59,075
ALEXANDER,
WHERE I COME FROM,

201
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,288
SIZE, SHAPE, OR COLOR
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE,

202
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,540
AND NOBODY
HAS THE POWER.

203
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,626
NOBODY?

204
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,880
UH, S-SOMEBODY
WANTS ME.

205
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,552
CAPTAIN, IT WILL BE
VERY GRATIFYING
TO LEAVE HERE.

206
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,639
THAT MIGHT NOT BE EASY
SHOULD PARMEN DIE.

207
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,806
EVEN IF HE SHOULDN'T.

208
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,517
YES.

209
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,268
THIS UTOPIA
OF THEIRS

210
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,313
IS ONE OF THE
BEST-KEPT SECRETS
IN THE GALAXY.

211
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,315
SCREENING THEMSELVES
FROM OUR SENSORS,

212
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,358
LOCKING US
INTO ORBIT--

213
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:35,694
ALL THIS ADDS UP
TO A PATTERN.

214
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,363
JIM,

215
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,239
MY CONCOCTION
ACTUALLY WORKED.

216
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,658
THE FEVER'S
BROKEN.

217
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,617
AND WHAT
RECUPERATIVE
POWERS.

218
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,453
THE INFECTION'S
BEGUN TO DRAIN
ALREADY.

219
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,456
DR. McCOY,
YOU MAY YET CURE
THE COMMON COLD.

220
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,500
IF THERE EVER WAS
A TIME TO GET OUT
OF HERE, IT'S NOW.

221
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,710
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>
SCOTTY, COME IN.

222
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,087
SCOTT HERE, SIR.

223
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,589
<i>PREPARE TO BEAM US UP.</i>

224
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,007
AFRAID I CAN'T
DO THAT, SIR.

225
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,716
EVERYTHING'S FROZEN.

226
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,427
THE TURBULENCE
HIT YOU THAT HARD?

227
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,970
IT'S NOT
THE TURBULENCE, SIR.

228
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,430
DAMAGE TO THE SHIP
IS MINIMAL.

229
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,640
WHAT CAUSED IT?

230
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,517
I DON'T KNOW, SIR,

231
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,686
AND THOSE
ARE THE FACTS.

232
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,645
DID YOU GET UP
INTO SPACE?

233
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,190
NO, SIR. THE ORBIT'S
LOCKED TIGHTER
THAN EVER,

234
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,983
AND SUBSPACE
COMMUNICATION
WITH STARFLEET,

235
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,110
IT'S COMPLETELY
SEVERED.

236
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,988
ALL RIGHT, SCOTTY.

237
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,325
I'LL HANDLE IT
DOWN HERE. STAND BY.

PHILOSOPHER KINGS
HAVE NO NEED
OF TITLES.

249
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:04,783
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY
THE SHIP'S INSTRUMENTATION
AND WEAPONRY IS FROZEN...

250
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,994
AND WHY THE<i>  ENTERPRISE</i>
IS LOCKED IN ORBIT.

251
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,995
CAPTAIN, PLEASE.

252
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,457
YOU ARE MISTAKEN,
I ASSURE YOU.

253
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,334
PARMEN, I'VE TALKED
TO THE ENGINEER
ABOARD THE SHIP.

254
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,129
WE'VE SHOWED
OUR GOOD FAITH.

255
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,590
NOW YOU SHOW YOURS.

256
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,425
I WANT THE SHIP
RELEASED IMMEDIATELY.

257
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,093
THE AMENITIES, CAPTAIN.

258
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:26,473
ALLOW ME TO REMIND YOU
THAT I AM THE HEAD OF
THIS PRINCIPALITY.

259
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:30,017
GUESTS DO NOT COME
BARGING IN HERE,

260
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,230
MAKING DEMANDS
AND ISSUING ORDERS.

261
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,525
GUESTS?

262
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,528
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE MEANING OF THE WORD.

263
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,614
GUESTS AREN'T TREATED
LIKE COMMON PRISONERS.

264
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,700
DO NOT TAKE
THAT TONE WITH ME.

265
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,085
OH!

266
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,841
OH!

267
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,064
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>
ACKNOWLEDGE.

268
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,026
ACKNOWLEDGE.
<i>ENTERPRISE,</i> COME IN.

269
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,110
<i>ENTERPRI--</i>

270
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,278
I CAN'T RAISE THEM.

271
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,904
OBVIOUSLY PARMEN
DOES NOT WISH

272
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,906
ANY CONTACT MADE
WITH THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

273
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,034
HE MAY STILL NEED
THE SHIP'S MEDICAL
STORES.

274
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,786
WHY PREVENT CONTACT?

275
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,498
TO SHUT OUT ANY KNOWLEDGE
OF HIS BRUTAL TREATMENT
OF A STARFLEET CAPTAIN.

276
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,249
NO, MR. SPOCK.
ONE THING FOR CERTAIN--

277
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,252
PARMEN ISN'T CONCERNED
WITH MY DIGNITY
OR SAFETY.

278
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,420
AGREED, CAPTAIN.

279
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,048
AND PARMEN WOULDN'T HAVE
TREATED YOU SO BRUTALLY

280
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:46,969
IF HE HAD ANY INTENTION
OF RELEASING YOU
OR THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

281
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,766
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

282
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,226
I DON'T KNOW.

283
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:57,647
I DON'T WANT
TO GO, BUT I
CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

284
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,946
[FANFARE]

285
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,048
GENTLE SPACEMEN,

286
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,634
WE ARE ETERNALLY
IN YOUR DEBT.

287
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,386
WE HAVE SOME
TRIFLES FOR YOU.

288
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,513
PLEASE ACCEPT THEM
AS TOKENS
OF OUR GRATITUDE.

289
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,182
THEY STEM FROM THE
VERY SOURCE
OF OUR INSPIRATION.

290
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,351
TO OUR NOBLE
CAPTAIN,

291
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,228
THE SHIELD
CARRIED BY PERICLES,

292
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,564
AS A SYMBOL OF
GALLANT LEADERSHIP.

293
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,322
TO OUR SILENT AND
CEREBRAL MR. SPOCK,

294
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,575
THIS KITHARA
TO PLUCK MUSIC

295
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,577
TO SOOTHE HIS
EVER-ACTIVE BROW.

296
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,125
AND LASTLY,
TO THE PHYSICIAN
DR. McCOY,

297
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,836
WHO SAVED PLATONIUS
AND MY SPOUSE,

298
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,464
THIS ANCIENT
COLLECTION
OF GREEK CURES,

299
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,425
PENNED BY
HIPPOCRATES HIMSELF.

300
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,934
HAS THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
BEEN RELEASED YET?

301
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,144
CAPTAIN, WAIT.

302
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,021
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

303
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,148
MY HUMBLE APOLOGIES.

304
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,983
YOU WERE BADLY USED.

305
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,778
IN MY OWN DEFENSE,
ALLOW ME TO SAY

306
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,989
THAT MY ILLNESS WAS MORE
PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING
THAN I MYSELF REALIZED.

307
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:34,034
I'M SURE THAT YOU, TOO,
CAPTAIN, HAVE BEEN
OUT OF SORTS

308
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,497
AND HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO
FITS OF TEMPER AND RAGE.

309
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,249
UNLIKE YOU, HOWEVER,
WHAT I THINK AND FEEL,

310
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,835
WHETHER FOR GOOD OR ILL,

311
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,920
IS INSTANTLY TRANSLATED
INTO REALITY.

312
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,840
SO PLEASE, FIND IT
IN YOUR HEART
TO FORGIVE ME.

313
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,883
CERTAINLY.

314
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,177
HAS THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
BEEN RELEASED YET?

315
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,595
IT WILL BE SHORTLY.

316
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,641
THEN GOOD DAY.
AND THANK YOU
FOR THE PRESENTS.

317
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,475
NOT AT ALL.

318
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,021
BUT THERE IS
ONE FINAL REQUEST.

319
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,190
AFTER MY NEARLY
FATAL INFECTION,

320
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,651
IT HAS BECOME
OBVIOUS TO US ALL

321
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,570
THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD
TO BE WITHOUT
A SKILLED PHYSICIAN.

322
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,825
THEREFORE WE SHOULD LIKE
YOU, DR. McCOY,
TO REMAIN.

323
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,410
I'M VERY SORRY,
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

324
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,330
YOUR DUTIES WILL BE
EXTRAORDINARILY LIGHT.

325
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,458
YOU'LL BE FREE TO READ,
MEDITATE, CONDUCT RESEARCH,

326
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,126
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

327
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,461
YOU'LL WANT FOR NOTHING.

328
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,129
THE ANSWER IS NO.

329
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,423
WE SHOULD LIKE TO
KEEP IT CORDIAL,

330
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,260
BUT WE ARE DETERMINED
TO HAVE YOU STAY, DOCTOR.

331
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,807
DR. McCOY
SAVED YOUR LIFE.

332
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,351
I AM LOSING
PATIENCE, CAPTAIN.

333
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,729
AND YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF
A DISCIPLE OF PLATO?

334
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,981
WE MANAGE TO LIVE
IN PEACE AND HARMONY.

335
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,691
WHOSE HARMONY,

336
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,150
YOURS?

337
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,653
PLATO WANTED TRUTH
AND BEAUTY

338
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,072
AND ABOVE ALL
JUSTICE.

339
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,908
MY DEAR MR. SPOCK,

340
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,410
I ADMIT THAT CIRCUMSTANCES
HAVE FORCED US

341
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,663
TO MAKE A FEW ADAPTATIONS

00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,328
BUT THIS TIME,
WHATEVER THEY SAY,
DON'T SAVE THEM.

519
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,663
LET THEM DIE.

520
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,164
GIVE IT TO ME!
AT LEAST LET ME
GIVE THEM A TASTE

521
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,207
OF WHAT
THEY GAVE ME.

522
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,959
PLEASE. THEY'RE
GONNA KILL YOU
ANYWAY. YOU KNOW THAT.

523
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,588
IN THAT CASE, WHAT'S
THE POINT IN YOU DYING,
TOO, ALEXANDER?

524
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,800
GIVE IT TO ME.

525
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,685
TH-THAT'S
THE FIRST TIME

526
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,313
ANYBODY EVER
THOUGHT OF MY LIFE
BEFORE HIS OWN.

527
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,695
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE

528
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,488
THAT THEY WERE GONNA
KILL YOU,

529
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,906
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT,
BUT I WAS AFRAID.

530
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,241
I WAS AFRAID.

531
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,785
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

532
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,162
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
ALEXANDER.

533
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,457
LISTEN, WE HAVEN'T
GIVEN UP,

534
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:20,671
AND THERE MAY BE
SOMETHING YOU CAN
DO TO HELP.

535
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,799
ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO HELP,
YOU JUST TELL ME.

536
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:27,927
ALL RIGHT.
DID THE PLATONIANS
ALWAYS HAVE THIS POWER?

537
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,389
NO, NOT UNTIL WE CAME
TO THIS PLANET.

538
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,516
ALEXANDER, IS IT
POSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO RECALL

539
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,519
HOW LONG AFTER
YOU ARRIVED HERE

540
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,730
THAT THEIR POWER
BEGAN TO DEVELOP?

541
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,481
HOW COULD I FORGET THAT?

542
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,484
IT WAS EXACTLY 6 MONTHS AND
14 DAYS AFTER WE GOT HERE

543
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,652
THAT THEY STARTED
PUSHING ME AROUND.

544
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,487
HOW WOULD YOU
KNOW HOW MANY
MONTHS' SUPPLIES

545
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,197
YOU BROUGHT
WITH YOU?

546
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,033
WELL, FOUR, I THINK.
NO, THREE.

547
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,910
THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH,
ALEXANDER.

548
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:52,703
FASCINATING.

549
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,873
THEIR POWER
DEVELOPED TWO
OR THREE MONTHS

550
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,251
AFTER THEY
STARTED EATING
THE NATIVE FOODS.

551
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,502
THAT'S RIGHT.

552
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,462
THEN IT'S LOGICAL
TO ASSUME THAT

553
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,507
THERE'S A CONNECTION
BETWEEN THE
PSYCHOKINETIC POWER

554
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,801
AND THE EATING OF
THE NATIVE FOODS.

555
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,888
THEN WHY WOULDN'T
ALEXANDER HAVE THE SAME
POWER AS THE OTHERS?

556
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:15,058
PERHAPS HIS SYSTEM
CANNOT ABSORB
THE CRUCIAL ELEMENT.

557
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,643
BONES, I THINK
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA

558
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,353
IF YOU TOOK A READING
OF ALEXANDER'S BLOOD.

559
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,899
UH, NOT THAT I'M
AFRAID OR ANYTHING,

560
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,442
BUT WILL IT HURT MUCH?

561
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,861
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
IT HAPPENED.

562
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,114
YOU STILL HAVE A
TRICORDER READING OF
PARMEN'S BLOOD, DON'T YOU?

563
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,073
OF COURSE.

564
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,658
PARMEN POSSESSES
THE HIGHEST ORDER

565
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,076
OF PSYCHOKINETIC
ABILITY,

566
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,453
AND ALEXANDER
THE LOWEST

567
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,705
IN THE SAME
ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS.

568
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,498
THE PROBABILITIES ARE
THAT ALEXANDER

569
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,166
WAS BORN WITH SOME
BIOCHEMICAL DEFICIENCY

570
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,210
RELATIVE TO PLATONIUS.

571
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,671
I'LL RUN BOTH THEIR
BLOOD SAMPLES THROUGH

572
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,882
FOR A FULL
COMPARATIVE TEST ON
THE TRICORDER.

573
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,301
AND IF OUR THEORY
WORKS OUT,

574
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,303
WE'VE GOT A WEAPON.

575
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:56,725
THE ONE SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PARMEN'S
BLOOD AND ALEXANDER'S

576
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,727
IS A CONCENTRATION
OF KIRONIDE

577
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,896
BROKEN DOWN
BY A PITUITARY HORMONE.

578
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,481
KIRONIDE.

579
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,899
IT'S A HIGH-ENERGY SOURCE.

580
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,400
THAT COULD BE IT.

581
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,487
THE PITUITARY HORMONES
CONFIRM THE HYPOTHESIS.

582
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,363
THEY ALSO REGULATE
BODY GROWTH.

583
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,074
OH. YOU MEAN,
THE SAME THING

584
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,494
THAT KEPT ME
FROM HAVING THE POWER

585
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,787
MADE ME A DWARF?

586
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,163
YES.

587
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,499
IT'S ALSO OBVIOUS
WHY PARMEN

588
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,208
KEPT THIS LITTLE
UTOPIA A SECRET.

589
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,170
ANYONE COMING DOWN
HERE AND REMAINING
LONG ENOUGH

590
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,922
WOULD ACQUIRE
THE POWER.

591
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:27,881
EXACTLY.

592
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,091
McCOY...

593
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,093
THERE MUST BE
A QUICK WAY

594
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,219
OF BUILDING UP
A CONCENTRATION

595
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,554
OF KIRONIDE
IN OUR BLOOD.

596
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,682
IT'LL TAKE SOME DOING,
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE.

597
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,934
WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR?

598
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,444
WHAT IS IT,
BONES?

599
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,280
WELL, EVEN IF
THE KIRONIDE REACHES
ITS DESIRED EFFECT,

600
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,324
IT STILL MAY NOT
HELP US GET OUT OF HERE.

601
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,284
YES. THERE ARE
38 OF THEM.

602
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,036
THE POINT IS
WELL TAKEN,

603
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,414
HOWEVER THE PSYCHOKINETIC
POWER IS NOT ADDITIVE.

604
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,710
IF IT WERE,
CONSIDERING THE PLATONIANS'
HOSTILE PROPENSITIES

605
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,712
TWO OR THREE OF THEM

606
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:08,714
WOULD HAVE COMBINED FORCES
CENTURIES AGO

607
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,048
AND DEPOSED PARMEN.

608
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,341
HE'S RIGHT.

609
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,926
YOU KNOW, PARMEN SAYS

610
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,887
THAT EACH ONE HAS HIS OWN
SEPARATE POWER FREQUENCY

611
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,723
BECAUSE BEFORE
WHEN THEY'VE TRIED
TO COMBINE THEIR POWERS

612
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,683
AND USE THEM TOGETHER,
IT NEVER WORKED.

613
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,267
I'M READY.

614
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,895
LET'S NOT
WASTE ANY TIME.

615
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,690
GIVE US DOUBLE THE
CONCENTRATION IN
PARMEN'S BLOODSTREAM.

616
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,358
THE TIME FACTOR
CONCERNS ME.

617
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,528
IT MAY TAKE DAYS
OR EVEN WEEKS

618
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,196
BEFORE THERE'S
ENOUGH BUILDUP
FROM THE KIRONIDE

619
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,908
TO BE OF ANY
BENEFIT TO US.

620
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,116
YES...

621
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,829
WHAT ABOUT
ALEXANDER?

622
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:44,082
SINCE THE KIRONIDE'S
BROKEN DOWN AND INJECTED
DIRECTLY INTO HIS BLOODSTREAM,

623
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,167
IT SHOULD WORK
ON HIM AS WELL AS US--

624
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,794
BETTER, IN FACT, BECAUSE
HE'S ACCLIMATED.

625
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,421
OH, NO.

626
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,131
NOT AFTER WHAT
THEY'VE DONE TO ME.

627
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,508
WHY NOT?

628
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,218
YOU COULD
CONCEIVABLY TAKE
PARMEN'S PLACE

629
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,971
AND RUN
THE WHOLE PLANET.

630
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,306
YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT I WANT?

631
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,602
BECOME ONE OF THEM,
BECOME MY OWN ENEMY?

632
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,729
JUST LIE AROUND
LIKE A BIG BLOB OF NOTHING

633
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,064
AND HAVE THINGS
DONE FOR ME?

634
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,982
I WANT TO MOVE AROUND
FOR MYSELF.

635
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,902
IF I'M GOING TO
LAUGH OR CRY, I WANT
TO DO IT FOR MYSELF!

636
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,654
YOU CAN KEEP
YOUR PRECIOUS POWER.

637
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,322
ALL I ASK IS ONE THING.

638
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,116
IF YOU DO MAKE IT
OUT OF HERE,

639
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,785
TAKE ME WITH YOU.

640
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,204
JUST DROP ME ANYPLACE
WHERE THEY NEVER HEARD OF
KIRONIDE OR PLATONIUS.

641
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,414
ALEXANDER--

642
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,969
Kirk: NURSE...
LIEUTENANT UHURA?

643
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:55,946
I GUESS WE WEREN'T
SUFFICIENTLY ENTERTAINING.

644
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,343
ARE WE EVER GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

645
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,929
WE WERE FORCED
IN THE TRANSPORTER
AND BEAMED DOWN.

646
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,140
IT WAS LIKE BECOMING
SOMEONE'S PUPPET.

647
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,058
I THOUGHT I WAS
SLEEPWALKING.

648
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,185
I COULDN'T STOP
MYSELF.

649
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,813
[LAUGHTER]

650
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,314
CAPTAIN,
WHAT IS IT?

651
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,816
WHAT'S GOING ON?

652
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,776
[LAUGHTER]

653
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,820
SPOCK, DO YOU FEEL
ANY EFFECT

654
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,404
OF THE KIRONIDE SHOT?

655
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,324
I DID EXPERIENCE
A SLIGHT FLUSH, CAPTAIN.

656
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,535
SO DID I.
LET'S TRY A SIMPLE TEST.

657
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,372
CONCENTRATE ON RAISING
THIS PLATE OF FRUIT.

658
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,715
NOTHING.

659
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,591
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

660
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,940
FELLOW ACADEMICIANS.

661
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:17,944
2,500 YEARS AGO,
A BAND OF HEARTY VAGABONDS

662
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,405
ARRIVED ON THIS BARREN,
ROUGH-HEWN PLANET.

663
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,741
THERE WAS
A DESPERATE HARDSHIP

664
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,993
OF BACKBREAKING TOIL.

665
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,995
AND THEN
A DIVINE PROVIDENCE

666
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,164
GRACED OUR GENIUS
AND OUR DEDICATION

667
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,624
WITH THE POWER OF POWERS.

668
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,254
AND THROUGH IT, OUR EVERY
NEED INSTANTLY MATERIALIZED.

669
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,381
WE THEREUPON DETERMINED

670
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,009
TO FORM
A UTOPIAN BROTHERHOOD.

671
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,386
THIS NIGHT IS INDEED
A FESTIVE OCCASION,

672
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,680
FOR TONIGHT, WE WELCOME
INTO THAT BROTHERHOOD

673
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,225
IT'S FIRST NEW MEMBER.

674
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,518
NOT YET, PARMEN.

675
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,730
YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE
THE DOCTOR FIRST.

676
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,525
THEY'LL NEVER DO IT, JIM.

677
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,860
DOCTOR, PLEASE.

678
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,363
YOU ARE DESTROYING
THE FESTIVE MOOD
OF THE LADIES.

679
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,200
WE MUST RECAPTURE IT
AT ONCE.

680
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,202
I KNOW.

681
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,162
WHAT WOULD BE BETTER

682
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,498
THAN A SERENADE FROM
THE LAUGHING SPACEMAN?

[LAUGHTER]

00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,622
[APPLAUSE]

702
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,133
OH, HOW FAITHLESS
AND FICKLE.

703
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:30,803
MAKE UP YOUR MINDS.

704
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,808
I'M SO ASHAMED.

705
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,270
PLEASE MAKE THEM STOP.

706
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,562
WE HAVE TRIED.

707
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,484
PLEASE!
PLEASE MAKE THEM STOP.

708
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,536
I HAVEN'T THE POWER.

709
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,665
I'M DEEPLY SORRY.

710
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,543
WE FAILED YOU.

711
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,966
FOR SO LONG I'VE WANTED
TO BE CLOSE TO YOU.

712
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:11,261
NOW ALL I WANT TO DO
IS CRAWL AWAY AND DIE.

713
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:23,440
CAREFUL, MR. SPOCK.

714
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,733
TOO MUCH LOVE IS DANGEROUS.

715
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:31,406
REMEMBER--CUPID'S ARROW
KILLS VULCANS.

716
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,414
I'M SO FRIGHTENED, CAPTAIN.

717
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,666
I'M SO VERY FRIGHTENED.

718
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,085
THAT'S THE WAY
THEY WANT YOU TO FEEL.

719
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,921
IT MAKES THEM THINK
THAT THEY'RE ALIVE.

720
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,174
I KNOW IT...

721
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:54,762
BUT I WISH
I COULD STOP TREMBLING.

722
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,266
TRY NOT
TO THINK OF THEM.

723
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,317
TRY.

724
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,657
I'M THINKING.

725
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:18,370
I'M THINKING
OF ALL THE TIMES
ON THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

726
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,538
WHEN I WAS SCARED TO DEATH...

727
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,211
AND I WOULD SEE YOU
SO BUSY AT YOUR COMMAND

728
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,254
AND I WOULD HEAR YOUR VOICE

729
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,216
FROM ALL PARTS OF THE SHIP...

730
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,176
AND MY FEARS WOULD FADE.

731
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,637
AND NOW THEY ARE
MAKING ME TREMBLE.

732
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,433
BUT I'M NOT AFRAID.

733
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,645
I AM NOT AFRAID.

734
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:47,565
OH...

735
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,909
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

736
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,375
PARMEN, LET'S
GET ON WITH IT.

737
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,253
YOU ARE SO IMPATIENT,
MY WIFE.

738
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,171
OBSERVE THE DOCTOR
AND LEARN.

739
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,173
HE'S QUITE CONTENT TO WAIT

740
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,675
FOR THE
<i>PIECE DE RESISTANCE.</i>

741
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,629
YOU'RE HALF DEAD,
ALL OF YOU!

742
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:57,009
YOU'VE BEEN DEAD
FOR CENTURIES.

743
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,511
WE MAY DISAPPEAR TOMORROW,

744
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,679
BUT AT LEAST
WE'RE LIVING NOW,

745
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,014
AND YOU CAN'T STAND THAT,
CAN YOU?

746
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,016
YOU'RE HALF CRAZY

747
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,893
BECAUSE THERE'S
NOTHING INSIDE. NOTHING.

748
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,396
AND YOU HAVE TO TORTURE US

749
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,608
TO CONVINCE YOURSELVES
YOU'RE SUPERIOR.

750
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:46,351
STOP IT, PARMEN!
STOP IT!

751
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:47,977
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT
ME TO DO.

752
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,647
I'LL STAY HERE AND
SERVE YOU, BUT STOP IT!

753
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:55,568
PARMEN.

754
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,403
ALEXANDER AGAIN.

755
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:01,282
HE LIKES TO PLAY
WITH KNIVES.

756
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,243
VERY WELL.
WE SHALL INDULGE HIM.

757
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,777
WHO DID THAT?

758
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,617
I DID.

759
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:45,702
[ERACLITUS]
IMPOSSIBLE!

760
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:46,952
QUITE POSSIBLE...

761
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,830
AND LOGICAL.

762
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,460
WHAT IS THIS?

763
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:55,961
WHAT'S GOING ON?

764
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,296
PLATONIANS,
LISTEN TO ME.

765
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,507
THE NEXT ONE OF YOU
THAT TRIES ANY TRICK

766
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:00,717
WILL GET HURT.

767
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,177
NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE YOUR
PSYCHOKINETIC ABILITY

768
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,304
BUT AT TWICE
YOUR POWER LEVEL.

769
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,473
NOT TWICE MINE!

770
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,168
CAPTAIN, NO!

771
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,254
CAPTAIN...

772
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,634
I BEG OF YOU!

773
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,093
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY.

774
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,471
I DO NOT WISH TO DIE.

775
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,478
CAPTAIN...

776
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,146
DO YOU HEAR ME?

777
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,318
DON'T STOP ME.
LET ME FINISH HIM OFF.

778
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:04,530
DO YOU WANT TO BE LIKE HIM?

779
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,181
PARMEN, LISTEN TO ME.

780
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:32,141
I COULD HAVE HAD
YOUR POWER,

781
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,768
BUT I DIDN'T WANT IT.

782
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,852
I COULD HAVE HAD
YOUR PLACE RIGHT NOW,

783
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:40,358
BUT THE SIGHT OF YOU
AND YOUR ACADEMICIANS
SICKENS ME.

784
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:41,609
DESPITE YOUR BRAINS,

785
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,986
YOU'RE THE MOST
CONTEMPTIBLE THINGS

786
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,322
THAT EVER LIVED
IN THIS UNIVERSE.

787
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:57,166
CAPTAIN...

788
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,044
YOU KNEW THAT
I INTENDED TO DESTROY

789
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,296
BOTH YOU
AND THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

790
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,255
YET YOU SPARED ME.

791
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,591
TO US,
KILLING IS MURDER,

792
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:07,176
EVEN FOR REVENGE.

793
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,095
BUT THERE WILL BE
OTHER STARSHIPS.

794
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,097
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR CONCERN.

795
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,307
THEY'LL BE SAFE.

796
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,185
OF LATE,
I HAVE BEGUN TO THINK

797
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,687
THAT WE HAVE BECOME BIZARRE
AND UNPRODUCTIVE.

798
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,314
WE'RE EXISTING MERELY
TO NOURISH OUR OWN POWER.

799
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,941
IT'S TIME
FOR SOME FRESH AIR.

800
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,236
WE SHALL WELCOME
YOUR INTERSTELLAR VISITS.

801
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,903
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

802
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,989
THAT WOULD BE HIGHLY
UNCHARACTERISTIC.

803
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,825
WE MUST EXPECT,
PARMEN,

804
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,827
THAT THE MOMENT
WE LEAVE HERE,

805
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,328
YOUR FEAR
WOULD BE GONE

806
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,372
AND YOU'D AGAIN BE
AS SADISTIC
AND AS ARROGANT

807
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,583
AS YOUR 2,500 YEARS
HAVE MADE YOU.

808
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:42,378
AND JUST REMEMBER,
WE CAN RE-CREATE THAT POWER
IN A MATTER OF HOURS,

809
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,547
SO DON'T TRY ANYTHING.

810
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,009
UNDERSTOOD, CAPTAIN.

811
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,969
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

812
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:53,514
NONE OF US CAN BE TRUSTED.

813
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:58,310
UNCONTROLLED, POWER
WILL TURN EVEN SAINTS
INTO SAVAGES,

814
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,437
AND WE CAN ALL
BE COUNTED UPON

815
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,273
TO LIVE DOWN
TO OUR LOWEST IMPULSES.

816
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:05,317
YOU'RE VERY GOOD
AT MAKING SPEECHES, PARMEN.

817
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:09,405
JUST MAKE SURE
THIS ONE SINKS IN.

818
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,656
NOW, MOVE ASIDE.

819
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,662
ALEXANDER.

820
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,794
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

821
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:25,170
MR. SCOTT, PREPARE
TO BEAM US UP.

822
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,715
I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

823
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,926
I'M BRINGING
A VISITOR ABOARD.
