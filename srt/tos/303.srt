1
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,035
LOOK AT THOSE
PINE TREES.

2
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,412
AND THAT LAKE.

3
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,917
I SWEAR THAT'S
HONEYSUCKLE I SMELL.

4
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,253
I SWEAR THAT'S A LITTLE
ORANGE BLOSSOM THROWN IN.

5
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,590
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
GROWTH,

6
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,175
EXACTLY LIKE THAT
OF EARTH,

7
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,553
ON A PLANET
HALF A GALAXY AWAY.

8
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,805
WHAT ARE THE ODDS
ON SUCH DUPLICATION?

9
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,890
ASTRONOMICAL, CAPTAIN.

10
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,976
THE RELATIVE SIZE,
AGE, AND COMPOSITION
OF THIS PLANET

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,980
MAKES IT HIGHLY IMPROBABLE
THAT IT WOULD EVOLVE
SIMILARLY TO EARTH

12
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,940
IN ANY WAY.

13
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,986
WHAT IN BLAZES
IS THAT?

14
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,322
Kirk:
ANALYSIS, SPOCK.

15
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,867
AN ALIEN METAL
OF SOME KIND.

16
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,119
AN ALLOY RESISTANT
TO PROBE.

17
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,790
READINGS CAN'T EVEN
MEASURE ITS AGE ACCURATELY.

18
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,463
THESE INCISED SYMBOLS
ARE FASCINATING,

19
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,841
EVIDENTLY
SOME FORM OF WRITING.

20
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,010
ANY THEORIES
ABOUT WHAT IT IS?

21
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,762
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.

22
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,722
STRUCTURES
OF THIS COMPLEXITY

23
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,433
REQUIRE EXTREMELY
SOPHISTICATED BUILDING
APPARATUS,

24
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,393
THE KIND USUALLY
FOUND IN CULTURES

25
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,063
SURPASSING
OR EQUALING OUR OWN.

26
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,231
MEADOWS
AND NO METEOR CRATERS?

27
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,901
THE WHOLE PLACE IS AN ENIGMA,
BIOLOGICALLY AND CULTURALLY.

28
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,780
WHAT'S THE NEAREST
CONCENTRATION OF LIFE
FORMS, MR. SPOCK?

29
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,328
BEARING 117, MARK 4.

30
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,957
AND HOW MUCH TIME
DID YOU SAY WE HAVE
TO INVESTIGATE?

31
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,708
IF WE ARE TO DIVERT
THE ASTEROID

32
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,668
WHICH IS ON A COLLISION
COURSE WITH THIS PLANET,

33
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,921
WE MUST WARP OUT OF ORBIT
WITHIN 30 MINUTES.

34
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,632
EVERY SECOND WE DELAY
ARRIVING AT THE
DEFLECTION POINT

35
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:15,260
COMPOUNDS THE PROBLEM,
PERHAPS PAST SOLUTION.

36
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,221
YOU DID SAY 30 MINUTES?

37
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,849
YES, SIR.

38
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,811
THEN LET'S GO.
LET'S FIND OUT

39
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:27,731
WHAT LIFE FORMS
ARE BLESSED BY
THIS ENVIRONMENT.

40
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:44,498
WHY, THEY LOOK LIKE--
I'D SWEAR THEY'RE
AMERICAN INDIANS.

41
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,791
THEY ARE, DOCTOR.

42
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,878
A MIXTURE OF NAVAJO,
MOHICAN, AND DELAWARE,
I BELIEVE.

43
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,840
ALL AMONG
THE MORE ADVANCED
AND PEACEFUL TRIBES.

44
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,010
IT'S LIKE
DISCOVERING ATLANTIS...

45
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:57,719
OR SHANGRI-LA.

46
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,222
MR. SPOCK,
IS IT POSSIBLE

47
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:05,393
THERE'S A MORE EVOLVED
CIVILIZATION SOMEWHERE ELSE
ON THIS PLANET,

48
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,437
ONE CAPABLE OF BUILDING
THAT OBELISK

49
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,024
OR DEVELOPING
A DEFLECTOR SYSTEM?

50
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,733
HIGHLY IMPROBABLE,
CAPTAIN.

51
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,320
SENSOR PROBES
INDICATE ONLY ONE TYPE
OF LIFE FORM HERE.

52
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,990
SHOULDN'T WE CONTACT THEM,
JIM, TELL THEM?

53
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,158
TELL THEM WHAT?

54
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,826
THAT AN ASTEROID'S COMING

55
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,786
TO SMASH THEIR WORLD
INTO ATOMS?

56
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,163
TOO PRIMITIVE
TO GRASP THE CONCEPT

57
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,789
OF SPACE FLIGHT,
DOCTOR.

58
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,374
OUR APPEARANCE HERE
WOULD ONLY SERVE

59
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,168
TO CONFUSE
AND FRIGHTEN THEM.

60
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,586
WE'VE GOT A JOB TO DO.

61
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,881
LET'S GET BACK
TO THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

62
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,726
WHAT'S THE MATTER, JIM?

63
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,895
WHAT?
OH, NOTHING.

64
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,731
JUST SO PEACEFUL,
UNCOMPLICATED.

65
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,774
NO PROBLEMS, NO...

66
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,194
COMMAND DECISIONS.

67
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,780
JUST...LIVING.

68
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,574
TYPICAL HUMAN REACTION

69
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,911
TO AN IDYLLIC
NATURAL SETTING.

70
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,872
BACK IN THE 20th CENTURY,
WE REFERRED TO IT
AS THE TAHITI SYNDROME.

71
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,625
IT'S PARTICULARLY COMMON
TO OVERPRESSURED
LEADER TYPES,

72
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,293
LIKE STARSHIP CAPTAINS.

73
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,713
AH, TAHITI SYNDROME.

74
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,757
LET'S GO TAKE CARE
OF THAT ASTEROID.

75
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,260
BUT FIRST,
I WANT ANOTHER LOOK
AT THAT OBELISK.

76
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,392
DOCTOR?

77
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,977
YES?

78
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,854
I SUGGEST THAT
ANY FURTHER RESEARCH
ON YOUR PART

79
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,482
BE DELAYED UNTIL
AFTER WE HAVE DIVERTED
THE ASTEROID.

80
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,201
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

81
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,452
Scott: YES, SIR.

82
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,775
<i>SPACE--</i>
<i>THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

83
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,576
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE.

84
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,328
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

85
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,998
<i>TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>STRANGE NEW WORLDS...</i>

86
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,501
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...</i>

87
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,297
<i>TO BOLDLY GO WHERE</i>

88
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,173

90
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,177
<i>NUMEROUS SEARCH PARTIES</i>

<i>HAVE FAILED TO LOCATE</i>

93
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,517
SPOCK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

94
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,977
Scott:<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>
COME IN, MR. SPOCK.

95
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,478
PREPARE TO BEAM US UP,
MR. SCOTT.

96
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,521
WE'RE WARPING OUT OF ORBIT.

97
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,524
LEAVING? YOU CAN'T
BE SERIOUS, SPOCK.

98
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,070
DOCTOR, THAT ASTEROID
IS ALMOST AS LARGE

99
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,403
AS YOUR EARTH'S MOON.

100
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,780
FAR ENOUGH AWAY,

101
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,282
THE ANGLE NECESSARY
TO DIVERT IT ENOUGH

102
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,993
TO AVOID DESTRUCTION
IS MINUTE,

103
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,245
BUT AS THE ASTEROID
APPROACHES THIS PLANET,

104
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,580
THE ANGLE BECOMES SO GREAT

105
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,414
THAT EVEN THE POWER
OF A STARSHIP--

106
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,708
THE DEVIL
WITH AN ASTEROID!

107
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,459
IT WON'T GET HERE
FOR 2 MONTHS, SPOCK!

108
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,546
IF WE ARRIVE AT THE
DEFLECTION POINT IN TIME,

109
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,464
IT MAY NOT GET HERE
AT ALL.

110
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,507
IN THE MEANTIME,
WHAT ABOUT JIM?

111
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,968
ONCE THE ASTEROID
HAS BEEN DIVERTED,

112
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,303
WE'LL RETURN HERE
AND RESUME THE SEARCH.

113
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,138
THAT MAY BE
HOURS FROM NOW.

114
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,639
HE MAY BE INJURED
OR DYING.

115
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,396
DOCTOR...

116
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,148
ASSUME THIS IS
THE PLANET WE'RE ON.

117
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,901
THIS IS THE APPROACHING
ASTEROID.

118
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,737
IF WE DON'T GET
TO THAT DEFLECTION
POINT IN TIME,

119
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:30,033
IT WILL BECOME
PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
TO DIVERT THIS ASTEROID.

120
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,578
IN THAT CASE, EVERYONE
ON THIS PLANET WILL DIE,

121
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,414
INCLUDING THE CAPTAIN.

122
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,457
CAN A FEW MORE MINUTES
MATTER, SPOCK?

123
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,460
IN THE TIME
IT HAS TAKEN ME
TO EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM,

124
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,588
THE ASTEROID
HAS MOVED FROM HERE
TO HERE.

125
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,591
THE LONGER WE DELAY,
THE LESS THE LIKELIHOOD

126
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,927
OF BEING ABLE
TO DIVERT IT.

127
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,521
BEAM US UP, MR. SCOTT.

128
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,074
<i>[THINKING]</i>
<i>WHERE AM I?</i>

129
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,285
<i>WHAT PLACE IS THIS?</i>

130
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,088
<i>WHAT ARE THESE?</i>

131
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,632
<i>I FEEL I SHOULD KNOW.</i>

132
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,135
<i>THEY'RE FAMILIAR</i>

133
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,762
<i>AND YET UNFAMILIAR.</i>

134
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,350
<i>HOW DID I GET HERE?</i>

135
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,102
<i>WHO AM I?</i>

136
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,855
<i>TRY TO REMEMBER.</i>

137
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,386
WAIT.

138
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,303
WHO ARE YOU?

139
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,890
WE ARE YOUR PEOPLE.

140
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,519
WE'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU TO COME TO US.

141
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,486
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG--</i>

<i>COMMANDING.</i>

143
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,784
<i>WE'VE BEEN EN ROUTE</i>
<i>TO THE ASTEROID</i>
<i>FOR SEVERAL HOURS.</i>

144
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,286
<i>OUR DELAY</i>
<i>ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE</i>

145
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:23,123
<i>HAS MADE IT IMPERATIVE</i>
<i>THAT WE PROCEED</i>
<i>AT MAXIMUM WARP SPEED</i>

146
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,709
<i>FOR A PERIOD WHICH EXCEEDS</i>
<i>THE RECOMMENDED SAFETY MARGIN.</i>

147
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,589
I CAN'T GIVE YOU WARP 9
MUCH LONGER, MR. SPOCK.

148
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,425
THESE ENGINES ARE BEGINNING
TO SHOW SIGNS OF STRESS.

149
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,052
STRESS OR NOT,
WE CANNOT REDUCE SPEED.

150
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,971
I DO NOT INTEND TO MISS
THAT DEFLECTION POINT.

151
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,807
ALL RIGHT. BUT WE'RE
MOVING FURTHER
INTO THE DANGER RANGE

152
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,183
ALL THE TIME.
IF THESE CIRCUITS--

153
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,851
OBJECTION NOTED,
MR. SCOTT.

154
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,104
CARRY ON.

155
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,246
MIRAMANEE HAS SAID
THAT YOU APPEARED TO HER

156
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,958
AND TO HER HANDMAIDEN
FROM THE WALLS
OF THE TEMPLE,

157
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,252
JUST AS OUR LEGEND
FORETELLS.

158
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,380
WE DO NOT DOUBT
THE WORDS
OF OUR PRIESTESS,

159
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,090
BUT THESE
ARE TROUBLED TIMES

160
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,259
AND WE MUST BE SURE.

161
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,428
I'LL ANSWER ANYTHING
I CAN,

162
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,678
BUT AS I TOLD YOU...

163
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,141
MANY THINGS
ARE STRANGE TO ME.

164
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,102
HE KNOWS NOTHING
OF OUR DANGER.
HOW COULD HE SAVE US?

165
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:30,524
IT IS AGAINST CUSTOM
TO INTERRUPT A TRIBAL ELDER
AT COUNCIL,

166
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,651
EVEN FOR THE MEDICINE CHIEF.

167
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,153
ELDER,
WORDS WILL NOT SAVE US
WHEN THE SKIES DARKEN.

168
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,030
WE MUST BE CERTAIN.

169
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,616

HE IS A GOD.

170
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,077
OUR SKIES HAVE DARKENED

00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,455
3 TIMES
SINCE THE HARVEST,

172
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,748
THE LAST TIME
WORST OF ALL.

173
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,585
OUR LEGEND PREDICTS
SUCH DANGER

174
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,963
AND PROMISES
THAT THE WISE ONES
WHO PLANTED US HERE

175
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,882
WILL SEND A GOD

176
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,467
TO SAVE US,

177
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,428
ONE WHO CAN ROUSE
THE TEMPLE SPIRIT

178
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,472
AND MAKE THE SKY
GROW QUIET.

179
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,558
CAN YOU DO THIS?

180
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,734
I CAME FROM THE TEMPLE
AS MIRAMANEE SAID,

181
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:22,033
AND IT WAS
A BEGINNING FOR ME...HERE.

182
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,786
BUT I CAME FROM THE SKY...

183
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,955
TOO.

184
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:32,960
ONLY I...CAN'T REMEMBER.

185
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,714
I...

186
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,257
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

187
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,552
SALISH, A TERRIBLE THING
HAS HAPPENED.

188
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,137
THE BOY WAS ATTENDING
THE FISH NETS.

189
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,057
HE BECAME ENTANGLED IN THEM
AND SANK TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE RIVER.

190
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:50,019
LUMO BROUGHT HIM UP QUICKLY,
BUT HE DOESN'T MOVE.

191
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,739
THERE IS NO SOUND
IN THE BODY.

192
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,116
THERE IS NO LIGHT
IN THE EYES.

193
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,034
HE WILL MOVE NO MORE.

194
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,953
WAIT A MOMENT.

195
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,159
WAIT!

196
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,626
[COUGHS]

197
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,429
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW.

198
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,348
MY PEOPLE ARE GRATEFUL.

199
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,143
IT'S A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE.

200
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,645
IT GOES WAY BACK...

201
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,066
WAY BACK...

202
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,863
ONLY A GOD
CAN BREATHE LIFE
INTO THE DEAD.

203
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,575
DO YOU STILL QUESTION?

204
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,167
GIVE HIM
THE MEDICINE BADGE.

205
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,934
Chekov:
DEFLECTION POINT MINUS 7.

206
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,811
Spock:
FULL POWER, MR. SCOTT.

207
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,606
THE RELAYS WILL REJECT
THE OVERLOAD, MR. SPOCK.

208
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,399
THEN BYPASS THE RELAYS,
GO TO MANUAL CONTROL.

209
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,401
DO THAT, WE'LL BURN
OUT THE ENGINES.

210
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,779
I WANT FULL POWER,
MR. SCOTT.

211
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,154
AYE, SIR.

212
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,323
ALL RIGHT, YOU LOVELIES,

213
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,158
HOLD TOGETHER.

214
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,123
FULL POWER,
MR. SPOCK.

215
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,958
MAGNIFICATION FACTOR 12,
MR. SULU.

216
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,627
AYE, SIR.

217
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,262
DEFLECTION POINT
MINUS 4.

218
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,639
ALL ENGINES STOPPED.

219
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,474
HOLD POSITION HERE.

220
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,732
ALL ENGINES STOPPED, SIR.

221
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,692
PREPARE TO ACTIVATE
DEFLECTORS.

222
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,820
AYE, SIR.

223
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,577
POWER DROPPING, SIR.

224
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,789
ENGINEERING,
MAINTAIN FULL POWER.

225
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:38,581
FULL POWER.

226
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,125
DILITHIUM CRYSTAL
CIRCUIT'S FAILING, SIR.

227
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,376
WE'LL HAVE TO REPLACE IT.

228
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,377
NOT NOW.

229
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,295
ZERO!

230
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,631
DEFLECTION POINT...
NOW, SIR.

231
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,132
ACTIVATE DEFLECTORS.

232
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,015
POWER DROPPING, SIR.

233
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,315
DEGREE OF DEFLECTION,
MR. SULU.

234
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,066
NOT ENOUGH, MR. SPOCK.

235
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:10,321
IT'S ONLY .0013 DEGREES.

236
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,407
RECIRCUIT POWER
TO ENGINES.

237
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,870
MAXIMUM SPEED,
HEADING 37 MARK 010.

238
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,997
AYE, SIR.

239
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,207
THAT HEADING WILL
PUT US DIRECTLY IN
THE ASTEROID'S PATH, SIR.

240
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,542
CORRECT, MR. CHEKOV.

241
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,752
I INTEND
TO RETREAT IN FRONT
OF THAT ASTEROID

242
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,921
UNTIL WE CAN
EMPLOY ALL POWER
ON PHASER BEAMS.

243
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,506
WHAT FOR?

244
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,590
TO DESTROY IT.

245
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,176
A NARROW BEAM
CONCENTRATED
ON A SINGLE SPOT

246
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,845
WILL SPLIT
THAT MASS.

247
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,513
IT MIGHT ALSO
CRIPPLE THE SHIP,

248
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,973
AND WE WOULD BE CRUSHED
BY THE ASTEROID.

249
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,726
INCORRECT. WE'LL STILL BE
ABLE TO GET OUT OF ITS PATH

250
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:40,643
BY USING IMPULSE POWER.

251
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,938
BUT JIM WON'T BE ABLE
TO GET OUT OF ITS PATH.

252
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,774
THAT, DOCTOR, IS
ANOTHER CALCULATED RISK

253
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,317
WE MUST TAKE.

254
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,789
MIRAMANEE...

255
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,378
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

256
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,422
I MUST SEE
TO THE NEEDS OF THE GOD,

257
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,591
AS IS MY DUTY.

258
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,301
YOU SHOULD BE WORKING
ON OUR RITUAL CLOAK.

259
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:18,347
THERE WILL BE NO RITUAL
BETWEEN US NOW, SALISH.

260
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,724
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

261
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,268
WE CANNOT GO
AGAINST TRADITION.

262
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:26,522
IT IS BECAUSE
OF TRADITION THAT
I CANNOT MARRY YOU.

263
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,025
BUT YOU ARE
PROMISED TO ME.

264
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,820
THAT WAS BEFORE<i> HE</i> CAME.

265
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:37,951
TRIBAL PRIESTESS
AND MEDICINE CHIEF
ARE ALWAYS JOINED.

266
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,954
<i>HE</i> IS MEDICINE CHIEF NOW.

267
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,291
SALISH, CHOOSE ANOTHER.

268
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,711
ANY MAIDEN WOULD BE
HONORED TO JOIN WITH YOU.

269
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,296
I...

270
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,006
WISH NO OTHER.

271
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,141
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

272
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,354
MIRAMANEE...

273
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,273
IF YOU<i> COULD</i> CHOOSE...

274
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,153
WOULD YOU CHOOSE ME?

275
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,575
PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE
TO BATHE NOW.

276
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,537
MIRAMANEE...

277
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,126
TELL ME
ABOUT THE WISE ONES.

278
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,460
TELL?

279
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,046
BUT A GOD KNOWS
EVERYTHING.

280
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,421
NOT THIS ONE.

281
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,256
TELL ME.

282
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,886
THE WISE ONES
BROUGHT US HERE
FROM FAR AWAY.

283
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,387
THEY CHOSE
A MEDICINE CHIEF

284
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:25,307
TO KEEP THE SECRET
OF THE TEMPLE

285
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,477
AND TO USE IT
WHEN THE SKY DARKENS.

286
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,940
SECRETS OF THE TEMPLE?

287
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,070
THERE ARE NO LACINGS.

288
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,197
HOW IS THIS THING
REMOVED?

289
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,450
THE SECRETS
WERE PASSED ON
FROM FATHER TO SON.

290
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,162
YES. HOW DOES THIS OPEN?

291
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,330
WELL, WHY DOESN'T
SALISH USE IT?

292
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,250
WHY ARE THE PEOPLE
IN DANGER?

293
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,171
HIS FATHER DID NOT WISH
TO SHARE HIS POWER TOO SOON.

294
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,674
HE DIED BEFORE
HE TOLD SALISH THE SECRET.

295
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,985
OUR PEOPLE REJOICE

296
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,238
AND WISH TO HONOR
YOUR NAME,

297
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:24,200
BUT I DID NOT KNOW
WHAT YOU WISH TO BE CALLED.

298
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,869
WHAT MAY I TELL THEM?

299
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,003
KIR...

300
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,464
KIR...

301
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,633
KIR...KIROK?

302
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,228
HAVE WE DISPLEASED YOU?

303
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,521
NO, NO,
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

304
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,692
THEN IT MUST BE OURSELVES,
THE WAY WE LIVE.

305
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,154
PERHAPS WE HAVE NOT
IMPROVED AS QUICKLY

306
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,990
AS THE WISE ONES WISHED.

307
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:07,285
YOUR LAND IS RICH,
YOUR PEOPLE HAPPY.

308
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,664
WHO COULD BE
DISPLEASED WITH THAT?

309
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,791
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING.

310
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,126
TELL US.

311
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,295
WE WILL CHANGE IT.

312
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,923
I CAN'T
TELL YOU ANYTHING.

313
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,262
ALL I CAN TELL YOU
IS THAT I'M...

314
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:31,017
HAPPY AND PEACEFUL
HERE.

315
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,352
I'M NOT SURE,
BUT I THINK

316
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,481
I'VE NEVER FELT
THAT WAY BEFORE.

317
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,702
WHY ARE THEY SO SURE
I CAN HELP THEM?

318
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,788
WELL, YOU CAME
FROM THE STONE METAL.

319
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,665
DID YOU NOT BRING LIFE
TO THE CHILD?

320
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,542
YES, BUT I...

321
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,842
I NEED TIME TO REMEMBER.

322
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,515
HERE THERE IS MUCH TIME.

323
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,937
FOR EVERYTHING.

324
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,245
COORDINATES, MR. CHEKOV.

325
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,621
TAU 8.7.

326
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,123
BETA .041.

327
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,750
THAT IS OUR TARGET--

328
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,877
THE ASTEROID'S
WEAKEST POINT.

329
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,172
ALMOST DEAD CENTER, SIR.

330
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,507
LOCK ALL PHASERS
ON THAT MARK.

331
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,676
MAXIMUM INTENSITY,
NARROW BEAM.

332
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,511
I WANT TO SPLIT
THAT FISSURE WIDE OPEN.

333
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,265
YOU SOUND LIKE
YOU'RE CUTTING A DIAMOND.

334
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,266
VERY ASTUTE, DOCTOR.

335
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,101
ALL PHASERS
LOCKED, SIR.

336
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,853
WE'LL FIRE IN SEQUENCE
AND CONTINUE FIRING

337
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,731
AS LONG AS MR. SCOTT
CAN MAINTAIN POWER.

338
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,733
STANDING BY, SIR.

339
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,318
FIRE PHASERS.

340
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,320
PHASER ONE FIRING.

341
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,407
THAT VULCAN WON'T
BE SATISFIED

342
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,325
TILL THESE PANELS
ARE PUDDLES OF LEAD.

343
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,659
PHASER TWO FIRING.

344
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,996
RELAY'S OUT AGAIN,
MR. SCOTT.

345
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,583
PHASER 4 FIRING.

346
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,297
ALL PHASERS FIRED, SIR.

347
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,007
RIG FOR SIMULTANEOUS
FIRING, MR. SULU.

348
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,676
COMMENCE SIMULTANEOUS
BOMBARDMENT.

349
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,311
MY BAIRNS.

350
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:40,980
MY POOR BAIRNS.

351
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,872
THE RITUAL CLOAK
IS FINISHED.

352
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:03,127
IF IT PLEASES YOU,
I WOULD LIKE TO NAME
THE JOINING DAY.

353
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,544
THE JOINING DAY?

354
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,588
I'M THE DAUGHTER
OF THE CHIEF.

355
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,175
TRIBAL LAW BETROTHS ME
TO OUR LEADER.

356
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,219
IF THERE IS ANOTHER,
I WILL STEP ASIDE.

357
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,308
NO, MIRAMANEE,
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE

358
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,684
IN MY MIND

359
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,518
OR MY HEART.

360
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:27,026
A GOD'S WISH
IS ABOVE TRIBAL LAW.

361
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,908
NAME THE JOINING DAY.

362
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,791
THE SOONER OUR HAPPINESS
TOGETHER BEGINS,

363
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,669
THE LONGER IT WILL LAST.

364
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,090
TOMORROW.

365
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,176
TOMORROW.

366
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,851
AND DON'T ASK FOR ANY MORE
WARP 9 SPEEDS, MR. SPOCK.

367
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,145
OUR STARDRIVE IS
COMPLETELY BURNED OUT.

368
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,439
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE LEFT
IS IMPULSE POWER.

369
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,148
ESTIMATED REPAIR TIME?

370
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,025

371
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:08,775
FOREVER.

372
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,362
THE ONLY THING THAT'LL FIX
THESE POOR DARLIN'S

373
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,406
IS THE NEAREST REPAIR BASE.

374
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,449
I'VE ALREADY SURMISED THAT.

375
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,659
THANK YOU, MR. SCOTT.

376
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,664
WELL, SPOCK,
YOU TOOK YOUR
CALCULATED RISK

377
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,666
IN YOUR CALCULATED
VULCAN WAY,

378
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,709
AND YOU LOST.

379
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,794
YOU LOST FOR US,
YOU LOST FOR THAT
PLANET,

380
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,463
AND YOU LOST
FOR JIM.

381
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,882
I ACCEPT THE
RESPONSIBILITY, DOCTOR.

382
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,092
AND MY
RESPONSIBILITY

383
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,468
IS THE HEALTH
OF THIS CREW.

384
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,387
YOU'VE BEEN DRIVING
YOURSELF TOO HARD

385
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:40,015
AND I WANT YOU
TO GET SOME REST.

386
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,937
MR. CHEKOV,
RESUME HEADING 883,
MARK 4-1.

387
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,023
BACK TO THAT PLANET?
WITHOUT WARP SPEED,
IT'LL TAKE MONTHS, SPOCK,

388
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:52,819
EXACTLY 59.223 DAYS,
DOCTOR,

389
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,405
AND THAT ASTEROID

390
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,823
WILL BE 4 HOURS
BEHIND US

391
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,409
ALL THE WAY.

392
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,411
WELL, THEN
WHAT'S THE USE?

393
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,871
WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO SAVE THE CAPTAIN

394
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,458
EVEN IF
HE STILL IS ALIVE.

395
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,461
WE MIGHT NOT
BE ABLE TO SAVE
ANYTHING,

396
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,212

397
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,220
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
A WORD I'VE SAID.

398
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,931

DOING IS STARING

00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,934
AT THAT BLASTED
OBELISK.

00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:29,315
ANOTHER CALCULATED
VULCAN RISK, DOCTOR.

401
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:37,448
THIS JOINING MEANS
THE END OF DARKNESS.

402
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:41,659
IT'S A TIME FOR JOY
FOR ALL MY PEOPLE.

UNTIL I WALK

THAT YOU FOLLOW

408
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,762

WILL TAKE PLACE.

00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,028

EVEN THOUGH
YOU BE A GOD, KIROK,

414
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,546
I CANNOT PERMIT
THIS JOINING.

415
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,255
NOBODY'S ASKING
FOR YOUR PERMISSION.

416
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,257
THEN YOU MUST
STRIKE ME DEAD.

417

I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF STRIKING YOU DEAD.

YOU BLEED, KIROK.

BEHOLD,
A GOD WHO BLEEDS!

TO MY PEOPLE

426
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,233
THAT YOU ARE NO GOD.

I THOUGHT YOU WERE
REPORTING TO SICK BAY.

429
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,740
THERE ISN'T TIME,
DOCTOR.

430
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,617
I MUST DECIPHER
THOSE OBELISK
SYMBOLS.

431
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,119
THEY'RE A HIGHLY
ADVANCED FORM
OF CIPHER WRITING.

432
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,412
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO DO THAT

433
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,081
EVER SINCE WE STARTED BACK
TO THAT PLANET--58 DAYS.

434
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,916
I'M AWARE OF THAT,
DOCTOR.

435
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,876
I'M ALSO AWARE
WHEN WE ARRIVE
AT THE PLANET,

436
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,464
WE'LL HAVE
BARELY 4 HOURS
TO EFFECT RESCUE.

437
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,091
I BELIEVE THOSE

BE MEASURED,

IS NOT IMPORTANT, DOCTOR.

FOREVER COOKING.

525
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,389
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

526
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,516
THAT'S NOT WHY
I MADE THE LAMP AT ALL,

527
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,769
TO KEEP YOU
FOREVER COOKING.

528
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,606
[THUNDER AND WIND HOWLING]

529
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,903
IT'S ONLY THE WIND...

530
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,738
AND THE THUNDER.

531
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,407
I ACT LIKE
A STUPID CHILD.

532
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,993
I HAVE NOTHING
TO FEAR.

533
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,828
YOU ARE HERE.

534
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,211
IT IS TIME.

535
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,965
TIME?

536
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,508
TO GO TO THE TEMPLE.
THE PEOPLE WILL BE WAITING.

537
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,717
WHY?

538
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:18,259
TO SAVE THEM.

539
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,095
BUT IT'S ONLY
THE WIND.

540
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,596
THE WIND
CAN'T HARM THEM.

541
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,515
THE WIND IS ONLY
THE BEGINNING.

542
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,933
SOON THE SKY
WILL DARKEN,

543
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,518
THE LAKE WILL GO WILD,

544
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:27,936
AND THE EARTH
WILL TREMBLE.

545
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,147
ONLY YOU CAN SAVE US.

546
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,898
BUT I CAN'T
DO ANYTHING

547
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:34,734
ABOUT THE WIND
OR THE SKY.

548
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,737
IF WE DO NOT GO NOW,
IT WILL BE TOO LATE.

549
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:38,989
YOU MUST GO
INSIDE THE TEMPLE

550
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,366
AND MAKE THE BLUE FLAME
COME OUT.

551
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:45,037
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GET INSIDE
THE TEMPLE.

552
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,122
BUT YOU ARE A GOD.

553
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,291
KIROK!

554
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,377
KIROK!

555
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,463
WHY ARE YOU NOT
AT THE TEMPLE, KIROK?

556
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,215
SOON THE GROUND
WILL BEGIN TO TREMBLE.

557
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,010
THE PEOPLE NEED
YOUR HELP.

558
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,720
WE'LL GO TO THE CAVES.

559
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,805
IT'LL BE SAFE THERE.

560
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,431
THE CAVES?

561
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,017
SURELY A LEGEND
CAN DO MORE THAN THAT

562
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,144
FOR HIS PEOPLE.

563
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:12,022
WHEN THE GROUND TREMBLES,
THE CAVES ARE NOT SAFE, KIROK.

564
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,940
IF YOU DO NOT ROUSE
THE TEMPLE SPIRIT,

565
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,650
WE WILL ALL DIE.

566
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,987
THERE IS NOTHING
YOU CANNOT DO,
MY HUSBAND.

567
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:22,032
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WAIT FOR, GOD?

568
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,449

569
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,958
TAKE CARE OF MIRAMANEE,

570
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,951
I AM KIROK!

571
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,621
I HAVE COME!

572
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:13,083
I AM KIROK!

573
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,309
I PRESCRIBED SLEEP.

574
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,603
YOU PRESCRIBED REST,
DOCTOR.

575
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,439
THE SYMBOLS
ON THE OBELISK
ARE NOT WORDS.

576
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,108
THEY ARE
MUSICAL NOTES.

577
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,151
MUSICAL NOTES?

578
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,986
YOU MEAN IT'S NOTHING
BUT A SONG?

579
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,528
IN A WAY, YES.

580
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,948
OTHER CULTURES,
AMONG THEM CERTAIN
VULCAN OFFSHOOTS,

581
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,825
USE MUSICAL NOTES
AS WORDS.

582
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,744
THE TONES
CORRESPOND ROUGHLY
TO AN ALPHABET.

583
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,913
WERE YOU ABLE
TO MAKE ANY SENSE
OF THE SYMBOLS?

584
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,415
YES. THE OBELISK
IS A MARKER,
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

585
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,584
IT WAS LEFT
BY A SUPER RACE

586
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,336
KNOWN AS
THE PRESERVERS.

587
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,963
THEY PASSED
THROUGH THE GALAXY

588
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,380
RESCUING
PRIMITIVE CULTURES

589
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,675
WHICH WERE IN DANGER
OF EXTINCTION

590
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,302
AND SEEDING THEM,
SO TO SPEAK,

591
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,846
WHERE THEY COULD
LIVE AND GROW.

592
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,056
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED
WHY THERE WERE
SO MANY HUMANOIDS

593
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,599
SCATTERED THROUGH
THE GALAXY.

594
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,351
SO HAVE I. APPARENTLY,
THE PRESERVERS

595
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,187
ACCOUNT FOR
A NUMBER OF THEM.

596
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,105
THAT'S PROBABLY HOW
THE PLANET HAS SURVIVED

597
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,606
ALL THESE CENTURIES.

598
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,942
THE PRESERVERS PUT
AN ASTEROID DEFLECTOR
ON THE PLANET.

599
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,652
WHICH HAS NOW
BECOME DEFECTIVE

600
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,196
AND IS FAILING
TO OPERATE.

601
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,281
AND WE HAVE TO
FIND THAT DEFLECTOR

602
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,075
AND PUT IT BACK
INTO WORKING ORDER.
OTHERWISE...

603
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,369

00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,665

611
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,308
THEN GO.

612
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:57,020

YOUR FALSE GOD.

IS UNIMPAIRED.

INSIDE THIS STRUCTURE?

00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:24,662
YES. WHAT'S INSIDE
IS LOADED

00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,704
WITH SCIENTIFIC
EQUIPMENT.

688
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,041

BY PLAYING CERTAIN NOTES

702
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,083
ON A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT?

703
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,502

ONE METHOD.

00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,922
SPOKEN IN THEIR
PROPER SEQUENCE.

706
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,008
GIVE ME YOUR COMMUNICATOR.

707
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,886
TONAL CONTROL,
CONSONANTS AND VOWELS--

708
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:23,471
I MUST HAVE
HIT IT ACCIDENTALLY

709
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:24,847
WHEN I CONTACTED
THE SHIP.

710
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,642
IF YOU COULD
REMEMBER YOUR EXACT
WORDS, CAPTAIN.

711
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,523
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

712
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,774
Scott:
AYE, CAPTAIN.

713
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,946
SCOTTY, IF THE DEFLECTOR
ISN'T ACTIVATED
WITHIN 20 MINUTES,

714
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,365
GET OUT OF ORBIT.

715
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,535
GET THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
OUT OF THE DANGER ZONE.

716
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,370
THE LANDING PARTY
IS EXPENDABLE.

717
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,247
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> ISN'T.

718
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,291
KIRK OUT.

719
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,001
MIRAMANEE.

720
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,257
BONES, STAY WITH HER.

721
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:00,883
DO WHAT YOU CAN.

722
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:14,313
IT IS SIMILAR
TO DEFLECTOR PANELS
I'VE SEEN, CAPTAIN,

723
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,982
BUT FAR MORE
COMPLICATED.

724
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,526
CAREFUL.

725
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:21,654
I MUST HAVE HIT
SOMETHING ACCIDENTALLY.

726
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,780
THE BEAM CAUGHT ME,

727
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,908
AND THAT'S WHEN
I STOPPED REMEMBERING.

728
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,535
PROBABLY
A MEMORY BEAM.

729
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,287
YOU MUST HAVE
ACTIVATED IT

730
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,871
OUT OF SEQUENCE.

731
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,082
THERE'S MORE SYMBOLS.

732
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,250
CAN YOU READ THEM?

733
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,543
I DO HAVE
AN EXCELLENT EYE

734
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:36,919
FOR MUSICAL NOTES,
CAPTAIN.

735
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,546
THEY WOULD SEEM
TO INDICATE

736
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:39,922
THAT THIS SERIES
OF RELAYS

737
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,257
ACTIVATED
IN THEIR PROPER--

738
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,176
SPOCK, JUST PRESS
THE RIGHT BUTTON.

739
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,348
[RUMBLING]

740
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,543
HOW IS SHE?

741
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,962
SHE HAD BAD
INTERNAL INJURIES, JIM.

742
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,381
WILL SHE LIVE?

743
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,592
NO.

744
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,664
KIROK, IT IS TRUE.

745
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,457
YOU ARE SAFE.

746
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,627
AND SO ARE YOUR PEOPLE,
MIRAMANEE.

747
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,801
I KNEW YOU WOULD
SAVE THEM, MY CHIEF.

748
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,223
WHEN I AM BETTER...

749
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:16,018
IT WILL BE
AS IT WAS,

750
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,146
WILL IT...NOT?

751
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,483
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

752
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,903
WE WILL LIVE

753
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,782
LONG
AND HAPPY LIVES.

754
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,035
I WILL BEAR YOU

755
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,663
MANY STRONG SONS.

756
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,790
[GROANS]

757
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:45,172
I LOVE YOU ALWAYS.

758
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:51,345
AND I LOVE YOU,
MIRAMANEE...

759
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,389
ALWAYS.

760
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,944
EACH KISS...

761
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,823
IS AS THE FIRST.
