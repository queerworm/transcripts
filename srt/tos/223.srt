00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,756
BRUISED ONLY.

173
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,759
WE WERE APPROXIMATELY
100 METERS
FROM THE VILLAGE

174
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,553
WHEN FIVE OF THE
SAVAGES AMBUSHED US.

175
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,972
WE MANAGED TO ESCAPE
WITHOUT FIRING.

176
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,599
SPOCK,
DO YOU SEE ANY HOPE

177
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,560
THAT THESE YANGS
CAN BE REASONED WITH?

178
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,978
A TRUCE,
A PARLEY, A--

179
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,021
NO, CAPTAIN.

180
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,398
THEY'RE TOO WILD.

181
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,609
THEY ACT ALMOST INSANE.

182
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,654
CAPTAIN TRACEY
IS BEING QUITE FACTUAL
IN SEVERAL STATEMENTS.

183
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,658
1--THE YANGS
ARE TOTALLY CONTEMPTUOUS
OF DEATH.

184
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,242
THEY SEEM
INCREDIBLY VICIOUS.

185
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,120
2--HE IS ALSO
BEING FACTUAL

186
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,914
IN THAT THE YANGS
ARE MASSING FOR AN ATTACK.

187
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,792
THERE ARE SIGNS
OF THOUSANDS OF THEM
IN THE FOOTHILLS BEYOND.

188
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,170
HOWEVER, HE WAS LESS
THAN TRUTHFUL

189
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,340
IN ONE VERY
IMPORTANT MATTER...

190
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,676
PHASER POWER PACKS.

191
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,094

192
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,928

OF SEVERAL HUNDRED

00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,810
THE FOOL.

195
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,146
A SMALLER ATTACK
ON THIS VILLAGE
A WEEK AGO,

196
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,773
DRIVEN OFF BY CAPTAIN TRACEY
WITH HIS PHASER.

197
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,151
I HAVE FOUND VILLAGERS
WHO WILL CORROBORATE IT.

198
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,735
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.

199
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,030
HE LOST HIS SHIP
AND HIS CREW,

200
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,366
AND THEN HE FOUND HIMSELF
THE ONLY THING STANDING

201
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,742
BETWEEN AN ENTIRE VILLAGE
OF PLEASANT, PEACEFUL PEOPLE.

202
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,245

ARE QUITE HARSH,

203
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,539
BUT THEY'RE ALSO
QUITE CLEAR, CAPTAIN.

204
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,334
IF YOU DO NOT ACT,
YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED
EQUALLY GUILTY.

205
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,463
WITHOUT A SERUM,
WE'RE TRAPPED HERE
WITH THE VILLAGERS.

206
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,633
WHY DESTROY
WHAT'S LEFT OF THE MAN
BY ARRESTING HIM?

207
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,802
I AGREE THAT FORMAL CHARGES
HAVE LITTLE MEANING NOW.

208
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,557
HOWEVER, YOU MUST AT LEAST,
CONFISCATE HIS PHASER.

209
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,601
THE FOOL.

210
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,187

MADE AWARE.

YES, SIR. CAPTAIN KIRK
INFORMED US EARLIER
YOU HAD SURVIVED.

00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,222

OF ANY KIND OF DISEASE.

LIVE IF ALL DISEASE
WERE ERASED, JIM?

WU.

263
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:11,471
TELL CAPTAIN KIRK
YOUR AGE.

264
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:12,722
AGE?

265
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,809
I HAVE SEEN 42 YEARS
OF THE REDBIRD--

266
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:19,228
THEIR YEAR OF THE REDBIRD
COMES ONCE EVERY 11 YEARS,

267
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,897
WHICH HE'S SEEN 42 TIMES.

268
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,189
MULTIPLY IT.

269
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,778
WU IS 462 YEARS OLD.

270
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:34,076
HIS FATHER
IS WELL OVER 1,000.

271
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,079
INTERESTED, JIM?

272
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,166
McCOY COULD VERIFY
ALL THAT.

273
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,168
HE WILL IF YOU ORDER IT.

274
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,378
WE MUST HAVE A DOCTOR
RESEARCHING THIS.

275
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,798
ARE YOU GRASPING
ALL IT MEANS?

00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,133

WE'VE FOUND IT,

277
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,885

279
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,515

WILL EVER WANT.

282
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,568
BY THOSE WHO OWN
THE SERUM.

283
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,821
McCOY WILL EVENTUALLY
ISOLATE IT.

284
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,864
MEANWHILE,
YOU INFORM YOUR SHIP

285
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,615
YOUR SITUATION'S
IMPOSSIBLE.

286
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,783
ORDER THEM AWAY.

287
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,326
WHEN WE'RE READY,

288
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,913
WE'LL BARGAIN FOR
A WHOLE FLEET OF SHIPS
TO PICK US UP,

289
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,247
AND THEY'LL DO IT.

290
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,833
YES, I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD.

291
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,877
BUT WE'VE GOT
TO STAY ALIVE.

292
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:28,255
LET THE YANGS KILL US
AND DESTROY WHAT WE
HAVE TO OFFER,

293
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,467
AND WE'LL HAVE
COMMITTED A CRIME
AGAINST ALL HUMANITY.

294
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,012
I'D SAY THAT'S SLIGHTLY
MORE IMPORTANT

295
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,054
THAN THE PRIME
DIRECTIVE...

296
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,556
WOULDN'T YOU, JIM?

297
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,140
THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING
PROPOSITION.

298
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,267
LET ME THINK IT OVER.

299
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,166

300
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,261
TAKE THE DOCTOR BACK
TO HIS WORKPLACE.

STAYS,

302
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,016
AND, WU, TELL YOUR MEN
WE'LL BE LEAVING SOON.

303
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,309
WE'LL BE IN AMBUSH
FOR THE YANGS...

00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,688

THIS TIME.

305

00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,634

TO DO SO,

CAPTAIN TRACEY MENTIONED

346
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,756
THERE WAS ONCE
A CONSIDERABLE
CIVILIZATION HERE.

347
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,842
THE ONLY
REASONABLE EXPLANATION
WOULD BE A WAR--

348
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,428
A NUCLEAR DEVASTATION
OR A BACTERIOLOGICAL
HOLOCAUST.

349
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,639
THAT'S A VERY
INTERESTING THEORY.

350
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:57,978
THE YELLOW CIVILIZATION
IS ALMOST DESTROYED.

351
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,606

IS DESTROYED.

THE WINDOW

353
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,903

REGAIN OUR FREEDOM.

354
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,571

355
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,749

357
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,710
YES, I HEARD, CAPTAIN.

358
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,670
THAT IS A WORSHIP WORD.

359
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:24,713

360
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,924

00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,685

364
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,024

365
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:49,113

A PRISONER OF THE KOHNS

366
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,107

UNTIL NOW?

367
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,486

368
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,114

WE CAN CONTACT THE SHIP
IN A FEW MOMENTS, CAPTAIN,

386
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,622
IF I CAN CROSS-CIRCUIT
THIS UNIT.

387
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,499
GOOD.
FIND OUT ANYTHING?

388
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,584
YES. I'M CONVINCED
THAT ONCE

389
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,462
THERE WAS A FRIGHTENING
BIOLOGICAL WAR THAT
EXISTED HERE.

390
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,088
THE VIRUS STILL EXISTS.

391
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,424
THEN OVER THE YEARS,
NATURE BUILT UP THESE
NATURAL IMMUNIZING AGENTS

392
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,384
IN THE FOOD, THE
WATER, AND THE SOIL.

393
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,385
WAR CREATED AN IMBALANCE

394
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,304
AND NATURE
COUNTERBALANCED IT.

395
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,806
THERE IS A DISEASE
HERE, SOMETHING
THAT AFFECTED

396
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,642
THE<i> EXETER</i>
LANDING PARTY
AND US.

397
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,560
THAT'S RIGHT. THESE
IMMUNIZING AGENTS TAKE TIME.

398
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,561
AND THAT'S THE REAL TRAGEDY.

399
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,523
HAD THE<i> EXETER</i>
LANDING PARTY STAYED HERE

400
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,608
JUST A FEW HOURS LONGER,

401
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,151
THEY NEVER
WOULD HAVE DIED.

402
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,279
THEN WE CAN LEAVE
ANY TIME WE WANT TO.

403
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,532
TRACEY IS
OF THE OPINION

404
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:20,949
THAT THESE IMMUNIZING
AGENTS CAN BECOME

405
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,493
A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.

406
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,538
THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE
OVER 1,000 YEARS OLD,

408
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,624
BECAUSE THEIR ANCESTORS
WHO SURVIVED

409
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,043
HAD TO HAVE
A SUPERIOR RESISTANCE.

410
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,586
THEN THEY BUILT UP

411
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,004
THESE POWERFUL
PROTECTIVE ANTIBODIES
IN THE BLOOD

412
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,632
DURING THE WARS.

413
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,967
NOW, IF YOU WANT
TO DESTROY A CIVILIZATION

414
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,553
OR A WHOLE WORLD,

415
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:43,514
PERHAPS YOUR DESCENDANTS
MIGHT DEVELOP A LONGER LIFE,

416
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,265
BUT I HARDLY THINK
IT'S WORTH IT.

417
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,018
THEN ANYTHING
YOU DEVELOP HERE

418
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,521
AS A RESULT OF ALL THIS
IS USELESS.

419
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,938
WELL, WHO KNOWS?

420
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,608
IT MIGHT EVENTUALLY
CURE THE COMMON COLD,

00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,068
BUT LENGTHEN LIVES?
POPPYCOCK.

422
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,653
I CAN DO MORE FOR YOU

423
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,031
IF YOU JUST EAT RIGHT
AND EXERCISE REGULARLY.

424
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,492
Spock: READY, CAPTAIN.

425
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,910

426
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,286
VOICE COMMUNICATION
WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE,

427
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,247
BUT WE CAN
SIGNAL THE SHIP.

428
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,499
ALL THAT BLOODSHED
FOR NOTHING.

429
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,626
THAT'LL BE SUFFICIENT,
MR. SPOCK.

430
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,591

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,599

IN THE CELL WITH YOU...

432
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,350
DID YOU SET HIM FREE?

433
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,645
THE SAVAGE, KIRK--YOU SENT
HIM TO WARN THE TRIBES!

434
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,523

MUST BE WARNED.

435
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,609
THEY SACRIFICED HUNDREDS

436
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:39,278
JUST TO DRAW US
OUT IN THE OPEN.

437
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,239

438
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,449
AND THEY CAME.

439
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:46,452
WE DRAINED

AND THEY STILL CAME.

441
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:53,500
WE KILLED THOUSANDS,
AND THEY STILL CAME.

00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,210

HAVE TO GET HIM

THAN THIS.

YOU'VE ISOLATED THE SERUM?

450
