1
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,528
INTERESTING.

2
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:28,863
AN ARKTURIAN MACBETH.

3
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:31,323
WATCH HIM.

4
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,825
WATCH MACBETH.

5
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,889
IS HE DEAD?

6
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:58,809
SPEAK.
IS KING DUNCAN DEAD?

7
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:02,437
ALL GREAT NEPTUNE'S
OCEAN,

8
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:07,317
WASH THIS BLOOD
CLEAN FROM MY HANDS.

9
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,904
THAT VOICE.

10
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,197
HOW IS IT WITH ME, WHEN
EVERY NOISE APPALLS ME?

11
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,492
THAT MAN
ON THE STAGE.

12
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,912
I'M CERTAIN OF IT.

13
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,414
THAT'S KODOS...

14
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,165
THE EXECUTIONER.

15
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,377
PLUCK'D OUT MINE EYES!

16
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:36,722
Kirk: SPACE--THE FINAL FRONTIER.

17
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,059
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES OF
THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

18
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,936
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--

19
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:45,814
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

20
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,901
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

21
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,113
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN
HAS GONE BEFORE.

22
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,985
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG--
STARDATE 2817.6.

23
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,862
STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE" DIVERTED
FROM SCHEDULED COURSE.

24
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,866
PURPOSE--TO CONFIRM DISCOVERY
BY DR. THOMAS LEIGHTON

25
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,077
OF AN EXTRAORDINARY
NEW SYNTHETIC FOOD

26
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,663
WHICH WOULD TOTALLY END
THE THREAT OF FAMINE

27
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,916
ON SIGNIA MINOR,
A NEARBY EARTH COLONY.

28
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,754
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU'VE
CALLED ME 3 LIGHT-YEARS
OFF MY COURSE

29
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,799
JUST TO ACCUSE AN ACTOR
OF BEING KODOS?

30
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,761
HE IS KODOS.
I'M SURE OF IT.

31
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,305
YOU SAID YOU DISCOVERED
A NEW FOOD CONCENTRATE.

32
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,556
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO PUT IN MY LOG,

33
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,308
THAT YOU LIED, THAT YOU
DIVERTED A STARSHIP

34
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,435
WITH FALSE INFORMATION?

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,394
YOU'RE NOT ONLY IN TROUBLE,

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,271
YOU'VE PUT ME
IN TROUBLE, TOO.

37
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,774
I DID IT
TO TRAP KODOS!

38
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,818
KODOS...

39
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,611
IS DEAD.

40
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,404
IS HE?

41
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,990
IS ANYONE SURE?

42
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,784
A BODY BURNED
BEYOND RECOGNITION?

43
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,912
TOM,
THE AUTHORITIES CLOSED
THE BOOK ON THAT CASE

44
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,164
YEARS AGO.

45
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,124
THEN LET'S REOPEN IT.

46
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,585
JIM, 4,000 PEOPLE
WERE BUTCHERED.

47
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,047
MARTHA, WILL YOU
TELL HIM?

48
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,256
I CAN'T TELL HIM
ANYTHING, JIM.

49
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,299
HE'S BEEN LIKE THIS

50
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,301
SINCE THE COMPANY
OF ACTORS ARRIVED.

51
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,808
KODOS IS DEAD.

52
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,018
I'M SATISFIED
WITH THAT.

53
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,063
WELL, I'M NOT.

54
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,106
I REMEMBER HIM.

55
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,402
THAT VOICE.

56
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,654
THE BLOODY THING HE DID.

57
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,618
JIM...

58
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,329
JIM, I NEED YOUR HELP.

59
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,998
THERE WERE ONLY
8 OR 9 OF US

60
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,417
WHO ACTUALLY SAW KODOS.

61
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,920
I WAS ONE.
YOU'RE ANOTHER.

62
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,213
IF HE'S TO BE EXPOSED--

63
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,547
HE'S DEAD.

64
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,551
THEN
IT WILL BE A GHOST

65
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,722
MARTHA AND I RECEIVE
IN OUR HOME TONIGHT.

66
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,306
I INVITED
THE ENTIRE COMPANY

67
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,060
TO A COCKTAIL PARTY.

68
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,187
I HAVE TO BE SURE.

69
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,397
I HAVE TO GET
BACK TO MY SHIP

70
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,273
AND FIGURE OUT
HOW I'M GONNA

71
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,776
ENTER ALL THIS
IN MY LOG.

72
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,485

WE ARE READY

00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,599
WE'LL DELAY DEPARTURE

MY FATHER WILL BE

128
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,777
MR...

129
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,112
CAPTAIN JAMES KIRK,

130
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,863
STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

131
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,573
OH. WE'RE HONORED.

132
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,994
I HAD HOPED
TO MEET YOUR FATHER

133
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,203
HERE TONIGHT PERSONALLY.

134
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,247
I'M SORRY,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

135
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,791
HE HAS A RIGID RULE
ABOUT THAT.

136
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,668
HE NEVER SEES ANYONE
PERSONALLY,

137
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,003
AND HE NEVER
ATTENDS PARTIES.

138
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,963
AN ACTOR TURNING AWAY
HIS ADMIRERS?

139
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,714
VERY UNUSUAL.

140
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,426
KARIDIAN IS A MOST
UNUSUAL MAN.

141
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,511
YOU SAW "MACBETH."

142
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,720
THAT WAS MY FATHER.

143
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,267
WELL, THEN I'LL TALK
TO LADY MACBETH.

144
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,523
SO, CAPTAIN
OF THE "ENTERPRISE."

145
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,732
INTERESTING.

146
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,153
SO, LADY MACBETH.
INTERESTING.

147
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,529
WHAT'S YOUR NEXT MOVE?

148
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:57,245
WE PLAY TWO PERFORMANCES
AT BENECIA

149
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,997
IF THE "ASTRAL QUEEN"
CAN GET US THERE.

150
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,874
SHE'S A GOOD SHIP.

151
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,584
THANK YOU.

152
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,837
YOU WERE VERY IMPRESSIVE
AS LADY MACBETH.

153
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,672
THANK YOU.

154
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,633
AND AS LENORE KARIDIAN?

155
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,554
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

156
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,266
LENORE.

157
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,146
I'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

158
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,399
YOU MEAN PROFESSIONALLY?

159
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:26,774
NOT NECESSARILY.

160
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,446
I THINK I'D LIKE THAT.

161
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,824
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE MUST KEEP A SCHEDULE.

162
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,452
YOU DON'T HAVE A SCHEDULE
NOW, DO YOU?

163
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,496
YOU MEAN LEAVE?

164
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,830
BUT I'VE ONLY
JUST ARRIVED.

165
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,665
SO HAVE I.

166
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,708
AND YOU HATE
TO OVERSTAY
A WELCOME.

167
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,253
EXACTLY.

168
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,546
WHY NOT?

169
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,756
GOOD.

170
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,133
I'LL MAKE OUR APOLOGIES
TO OUR HOSTESS.

171
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,676
I'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE.

172
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,065
TIRED OF WALKING?

173
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,568
NO. JUST THINKING.

174
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,528
ABOUT WHAT?

175
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,781
AT THE PARTY, YOU WERE
SUCH A BRASH YOUNG MAN.

176
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,032
AND NOW?

177
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,700
NOW SOMEHOW DIFFERENT.

178
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,578
NOT A SHIP'S CAPTAIN
WITH ALL THOSE PEOPLE

179
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,331
TO BE STRONG
AND CONFIDENT
IN FRONT OF.

180
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:26,960
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
REALLY VERY DEAR,
AREN'T YOU?

181
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,628
IN SOME WAYS...

182
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,465
VERY LONELY.

183
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,858
IT'S TOM LEIGHTON.

184
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,613
HE'S DEAD.

185
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,539
TOM...

186
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,419
AT LEAST
HE HAS PEACE NOW.

187
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,505
HE NEVER REALLY
HAD THAT BEFORE.

188
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,217
OH,
WHY WAS TOM KILLED

189
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,011
IF WHAT HE SUSPECTED
WASN'T TRUE?

190
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,137
I DON'T KNOW.

191
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,014
I'LL TRY AND FIND OUT.

192
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,892
OH, JIM.

193
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,811
HOW I'LL MISS HIM.

194
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,283
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

195
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,451
Uhura: BRIDGE
HERE, CAPTAIN.

196
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,120
PUT ME THROUGH
TO CAPTAIN JOHN DALEY

197
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,289
OF THE "ASTRAL QUEEN"
IN ORBIT STATION,

198
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,958
AND PUT IT ON SCRAMBLE,
WILL YOU?

199
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,793
CAPTAIN DALEY'S
ON, SIR.

200
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,129
JOHN. JIM KIRK.

201
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,964
Daley: HI, JIM.

202
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,174
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

203
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,926
I OWE YOU A DOZEN.
JUST ASK.

204
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,761
DON'T MAKE
YOUR PICKUP HERE.

205
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,847
YOU MEAN STRAND
ALL THOSE ACTORS?

206
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,516
I'LL PICK THEM UP.

207
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,517
AND IF THERE'S
ANY TROUBLE,

208
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,227
IT'LL BE
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

209
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,062
WILL DO.
ANYTHING ELSE?

210
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,691
JUST KEEP THIS
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US

211
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,151
AND ACCEPT MY THANKS.
OVER AND OUT.

212
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,361
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

213
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,071
Uhura: BRIDGE
HERE, CAPTAIN.

214
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,406
TRANSPORTER ROOM.

215
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,615
READY TO BEAM UP.

216
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,960
AHA.

217
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,133
READY TO RESUME
COURSE, CAPTAIN.

218
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,844
I THINK WE'RE DUE
FOR A PICKUP.

219
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,890
WHAT KIND,
PERSONNEL? CARGO?

220
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,350
CAPTAIN?

221
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,019
A MISS KARIDIAN HAS BEEN
TRANSPORTED ABOARD SHIP.

222
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,979
SHE REQUESTS PERMISSION
TO SEE YOU.

223
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,275
TELL HER TO COME
UP TO THE BRIDGE.

224
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,444
Uhura: ESCORT MISS KARIDIAN
TO THE BRIDGE.

225
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,624
HOW DID YOU KNOW
THIS LADY
WAS COMING ABOARD?

226
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,083
I'M THE CAPTAIN.

227
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,594
CAPTAIN KIRK,
I DIDN'T THINK WE'D BE
MEETING AGAIN SO SOON.

228
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,678
YOU PROBABLY
WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME

229
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,054
IF I TOLD YOU
I ARRANGED IT.

230
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,224
NO, BUT IT'S
A DELIGHTFUL THOUGHT.

231
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,101
CAPTAIN, I'M AFRAID
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

232
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,312
WE'VE BEEN STRANDED.

233
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,772
IT SEEMS
THAT OUR TRANSPORTATION

234
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,398
HAS CANCELED OUT
ON US.

235
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,275
CAN'T YOU MAKE
OTHER ARRANGEMENTS?

236
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,526
WELL, YES,
BUT NOT IN TIME.

237
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,237
YOU SEE, OUR SCHEDULE
IS LIKE A CHAIN.

238
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,448
ONE BREAK
AND IT ALL COLLAPSES.

239
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:44,991
BE A SHAME
IF THAT HAPPENED.

240
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,703
IF EVER WE NEEDED
A GOOD SAMARITAN.

241
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,959
WELL, I...

242
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,377
I APPEAL TO YOU.

243
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,630
THE REGULATIONS
ARE VERY CLEAR

244
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,256
ABOUT TAKING ON
PASSENGERS.

245
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,842
I'LL MAKE A BARGAIN
WITH YOU, CAPTAIN.

246
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,471
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
TO TRADE?

247
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,807
SPECIAL PERFORMANCE
FOR THE CREW

248
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,142
IN EXCHANGE FOR A LIFT.

249
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,769
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
VERY INTERESTING.

250
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,605
THE CREW'S BEEN ON PATROL
FOR A LONG TIME.

251
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,816
THEY COULD USE
A BREAK IN THE...

252
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,317
MONOTONY.

253
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,444
THEN YOU'LL DO IT?

254
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,155
YOU'VE GOT ME BACKED
INTO A CORNER.

255
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,156
THE MEN WOULD
NEVER FORGIVE ME

256
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,201
IF I DEPRIVED THEM
OF YOUR PERFORMANCE

257
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,661
AND YOUR PRESENCE.

258
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,455
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

259
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,290
I'M ETERNALLY GRATEFUL.

260
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,917
I'LL GET THE COMPANY
READY.

261
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,587
THIS MEANS
SO MUCH TO THEM.

262
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,172
MR. SPOCK,

263
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,716
PREPARE
TO LEAVE ORBIT

264
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,717
AS SOON AS
THE KARIDIAN COMPANY

265
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:44,592
IS ABOARD THE SHIP.

266
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,598
MAY I INQUIRE AS TO
OUR COURSE, CAPTAIN?

267
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,017
BENECIA COLONY.

268
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,562
BENECIA COLONY
IS 8 LIGHT-YEARS
OFF OUR COURSE.

269
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,105
IF MY MEMORY
NEEDS REFRESHING,
MR. SPOCK,

270
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,106
I'LL ASK YOU FOR IT.

271
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,401
IN THE MEANTIME,
FOLLOW MY ORDERS.

272
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,753
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG--
STARDATE 2818.9.

273
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,962
THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS
IN MY MIND--

274
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,423
TOO MANY, PERHAPS--

275
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,509
ABOUT THE ACTOR KARIDIAN
AND HIS DAUGHTER.

276
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,094
FOR PERSONAL REASONS,
I'M ALMOST AFRAID

277
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,888
TO LEARN THE ANSWERS.

278
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,602
MR. SPOCK,

279
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,228
E.T.A.
THE BENECIA COLONY.

280
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,064
WE'LL ARRIVE
STARDATE 2825.3, CAPTAIN,

281
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,483
APPROXIMATELY 1500
BENECIA TIME.

282
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,788
Electronic voice:
LIBRARY COMPUTER.

283
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:58,792
DATA ON
QUESTIONS SUBMITTED
TO PERSONNEL FILES.

284
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,210
DATA BEING RECEIVED.

285
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,044
KODOS FILE--

286
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,004
OF ALL SURVIVORS,

287
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,591
THERE ARE 9
ACTUAL EYEWITNESSES

288
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,301
WHO CAN
IDENTIFY KODOS.

289
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,552
STOP.

290
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,970
GIVE LIST.

291
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,934
KIRK, J.--PRESENTLY
"ENTERPRISE" CAPTAIN,

292
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,811
LEIGHTON, T.,

293
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,479
MOULTON, E.,

294
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,314
RILEY, K.,

295
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,273
EAMES, D.--

296
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,942
STOP.

297
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,944
IS THAT STAR SERVICE
LIEUTENANT KEVIN RILEY?

298
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,029
AFFIRMATIVE.
RILEY, KEVIN,

299
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:33,200
PRESENTLY ASSIGNED
U.S.S. "ENTERPRISE"
COMMUNICATIONS SECTION.

300
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,410
STOP.

301
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,622
MR. SPOCK.

302
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,081
CAPTAIN.

303
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,293
LIEUTENANT KEVIN RILEY
IN COMMUNICATIONS--

304
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,338
I WISH TO HAVE HIM TRANSFERRED
DOWN TO THE ENGINEERING DESK.

305
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,173
HE CAME UP
FROM ENGINEERING,
CAPTAIN.

306
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,842
WELL, I'M
SENDING HIM BACK.

307
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,259
ANY EXPLANATION?

308
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,385
HE'S A FINE
YOUNG OFFICER.

309
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,012
HE'S BOUND
TO CONSIDER
THIS TRANSFER

310
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,263
A DISCIPLINARY
ACTION.

311
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,222
I DON'T WISH
TO DISCUSS IT,
MR. SPOCK.

312
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,016
PLEASE FOLLOW
MY ORDERS.

313
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,271
MR. SPOCK, WHEN
THE MAN ON TOP
WALKS ALONG HIS STREET,

314
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,440
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND
IS OFTEN A NOOSE.

315
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,985
SPARE ME
YOUR PHILOSOPHICAL
METAPHORS, DOCTOR.

316
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,864
CAPTAIN IS
ACTING STRANGELY.

317
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,199
I'M ASKING
IF YOU'VE NOTICED.

318
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,535
NEGATIVE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME IN A WEEK

319
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,496
THAT I'VE HAD TIME
FOR A DROP OF A DREW?

320
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,665
WOULD YOU CARE
FOR A DRINK, MR. SPOCK?

321
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,124
MY FATHER'S RACE
WAS SPARED

322
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,919
THE DUBIOUS BENEFITS
OF ALCOHOL.

323
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,547
OH. NOW I KNOW
WHY THEY WERE CONQUERED.

324
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,215
WHAT ARE YOU SO
WORRIED ABOUT, ANYWAY?

325
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,676
I FIND JIM
GENERALLY KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

326
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,093
IT WAS ILLOGICAL
FOR HIM

327
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,762
TO BRING THOSE
PLAYERS ABOARD.

328
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,890
ILLOGICAL? DID YOU
GET A LOOK

329
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:37,473
AT THAT
LITTLE JULIET?

330
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,644
THAT'S A PRETTY
EXCITING CREATURE.

331
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,188
OF COURSE, YOUR
PERSONAL CHEMISTRY

332
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,274
WOULD PREVENT YOU
FROM SEEING THAT.

333
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,275
DID IT EVER
OCCUR TO YOU

334
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,528
THAT HE SIMPLY
MIGHT LIKE THE GIRL?

335
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,614
IT OCCURRED.
I DISMISSED IT.

336
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,616
YOU WOULD.

337
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,868
DID YOU KNOW THAT HE
SUDDENLY TRANSFERRED

338
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,870
LIEUTENANT RILEY
TO ENGINEERING?

339
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,038
LOTS OF THINGS
ARE GOING AROUND HERE

340
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,040
THAT I DON'T KNOW,
MR. SPOCK.

341
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,250
NOW, HE'S THE CAPTAIN.
HE CAN TRANSFER PEOPLE
AS HE PLEASES.

342
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,626
YOU CAN LOOK THAT UP
IN 100 VOLUMES

343
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,754
OF SPACE REGULATIONS
SOMEWHERE,
ALL RIGHT?

344
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,338
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, COME ON.
HAVE A DRINK.

345
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,799
NO, THANK YOU.

346
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,093
WELL,
YOU'RE WELCOME,
BUT I WILL,

347
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,803
AND PLEASE,
MR. SPOCK,

348
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,097
IF YOU WON'T
JOIN ME,

349
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,140
DON'T DISAPPROVE
OF ME,

350
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,476
AT LEAST NOT UNTIL
YOU'VE TRIED IT,
HUH?

351
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,439
[SIGH]

352
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,404
THIS IS THE, UH,
OBSERVATION DECK.

353
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,239
THAT'S THE FLIGHT
DECK DOWN THERE--

354
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,034
WITH
THE SHUTTLE CRAFT.

355
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,077
INTERESTING.

356
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,995
ISN'T IT?

357
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,413
TELL ME,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

358
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,289
ANYTHING.

359
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,874
DID YOU ORDER
THE SOFT LIGHTS

360
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,667
ESPECIALLY
FOR THE OCCASION?

361
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,632
IF I HAD ORDERED
SOFT LIGHTS,

362
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,802
I'D ALSO HAVE ARRANGED
FOR MUSIC AND FLOWERS.

363
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,387
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT ISN'T SO.

364
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,931
ON THE "ENTERPRISE,"
WE TRY TO DUPLICATE

365
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,975
EARTH CONDITIONS
OF NIGHT AND DAY

366
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,268
AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE.

367
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,022
STAR LIGHT, STAR BRIGHT.

368
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,316
I WISH I MAY,
I WISH I MIGHT.

369
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,234
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT,
CAPTAIN?

370
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,820
IT'S VERY OLD.

371
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,114
ALMOST AS OLD
AS THE STARS THEMSELVES.

372
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,034
AND THIS SHIP.

373
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,203
ALL THIS POWER
SURGING AND THROBBING,

374
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,538
YET UNDER CONTROL.

375
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,584
ARE YOU LIKE THAT, CAPTAIN?

376
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,097
ALL THIS POWER
AT YOUR COMMAND,

377
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,849
THE DECISIONS
THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE...

378
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,601
COME FROM A VERY
HUMAN SOURCE.

379
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,478
ARE YOU, CAPTAIN?

380
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,938
HUMAN?

381
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,775
YOU CAN COUNT ON IT.

382
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,486
TELL ME ABOUT THE WOMEN
IN YOUR WORLD, CAPTAIN.

383
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,072
I'D RATHER
TALK ABOUT YOU.

384
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,616
YOU MUST HAVE
WANTED TO PERFORM

385
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,910
SINCE THE FIRST TIME
YOU SAW YOUR FATHER ACT.

386
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,453
WHEN WAS THAT?

387
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,663
IN THE BEGINNING.

388
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,539
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

389
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,124
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

390
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,334
YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED
MY QUESTION.

391
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,711
ABOUT THE WOMEN.

392
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,963
WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO KNOW?

393
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,174
HAS THE MACHINE
CHANGED THEM?

394
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,719
MADE THEM JUST PEOPLE
INSTEAD OF WOMEN?

395
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,473
WORLDS MAY CHANGE,

396
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,933
GALAXIES DISINTEGRATE,

397
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,519
BUT A WOMAN...

398
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,938
ALWAYS REMAINS A WOMAN.

399
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,982
ALL THIS...

400
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,984
AND POWER, TOO.

401
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,739
THE CAESAR
OF THE STARS

402
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,408
AND THE CLEOPATRA
TO WORSHIP HIM.

403
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,632
Electronic voice:
LIBRARY COMPUTER.

404
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,011

ANTON KARIDIAN,

407
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,892
LIEUTENANT KEVIN RILEY.

408
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,063
AND CAPTAIN
JAMES T. KIRK.

409
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,442
ACCOMPLISHED.
STANDING BY.

410
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,820
CORRELATE. CHECK
THEIR PAST HISTORIES.

411
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:20,821
REPORT ANY ITEM,

412
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,156
ANY PAST EPISODE
OR EXPERIENCE

413
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,616
THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON.

414
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:26,660
AFFIRMATIVE.

415
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,627
I APPRECIATE WHATEVER
CONCERN YOU MAY HAVE

416
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:35,920
FOR THE SHIP'S
COMPANY, MR. SPOCK--

417
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,047
I WILL CONTINUE,
DOCTOR.

418
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,007
ACCORDING TO
OUR LIBRARY BANKS,

419
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,926
IT STARTED
ON THE EARTH COLONY
OF TARSUS IV

420
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,469
WHEN THE FOOD SUPPLY
WAS ATTACKED

421
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,805
BY AN EXOTIC FUNGUS
AND LARGELY
DESTROYED.

422
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,140
THERE WERE
OVER 8,000 COLONISTS

423
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,183
AND VIRTUALLY
NO FOOD.

424
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,644
AND THAT WAS WHEN
GOVERNOR KODOS
SEIZED FULL POWER

425
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,104
AND DECLARED
EMERGENCY
MARTIAL LAW.

426
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,688
I'VE HEARD OF IT.

427
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:55,606
YOU MAY NOT HAVE
HEARD IT ALL.

428
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,400
KODOS BEGAN
TO SEPARATE
THE COLONISTS.

429
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,526
SOME WOULD LIVE,

430
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,988
BE RATIONED WHATEVER
FOOD WAS LEFT.

431
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,116
THE REMAINDER
WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY
PUT TO DEATH.

432
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,368
APPARENTLY, HE HAD
HIS OWN THEORIES
OF EUGENICS.

433
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,997
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE WASN'T THE FIRST.

434
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,665
PERHAPS NOT,
BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY

435
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,626
AMONG THE MOST RUTHLESS
TO DECIDE ARBITRARILY

436
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,376
WHO WOULD SURVIVE
AND WHO WOULD NOT,

437
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,921
USING HIS OWN
PERSONAL STANDARDS

438
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,174
AND THEN TO IMPLEMENT
HIS DECISION
WITHOUT MERCY.

439
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,800
CHILDREN WATCHING
THEIR PARENTS DIE.

440
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,384
WHOLE FAMILIES DESTROYED.

441
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,386
OVER 4,000 PEOPLE.

442
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:30,891
THEY DIED QUICKLY,
WITHOUT PAIN,
BUT THEY DIED.

443
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,061
RELIEF ARRIVED,
BUT TOO LATE TO PREVENT
THE EXECUTIONS.

444
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,562
AND KODOS,

445
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,816
THERE NEVER WAS A POSITIVE
IDENTIFICATION OF HIS BODY.

446
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,776
BUT WHAT IS
KARIDIAN TO DO
WITH IT?

447
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,528
HIS HISTORY BEGINS

448
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:46,615
ALMOST TO THE DAY
WHERE KODOS DISAPPEARED.

449
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,618
AND YOU THINK JIM
SUSPECTS HE'S KODOS?

450
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,912
HE'D BETTER.

451
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,539
THERE WERE
9 EYEWITNESSES

452
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:54,748
WHO SURVIVED
THE MASSACRE

453
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,168
WHO'D ACTUALLY SEEN KODOS
WITH THEIR OWN EYES.

454
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,753
JIM KIRK
WAS ONE OF THEM.

455
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,340
WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF RILEY AND CAPTAIN KIRK,

456
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,300
EVERY OTHER EYEWITNESS
IS DEAD,

457
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,677
AND MY LIBRARY COMPUTER
SHOWS

458
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,012
THAT WHEREVER THEY WERE--

459
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:11,473
ON EARTH, ON A COLONY,
OR ABOARD SHIP--

460
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,018
THE KARIDIAN
COMPANY OF PLAYERS
WAS SOMEWHERE NEAR

461
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,895
WHEN THEY DIED.

462
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,522
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

463
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:32,661
HEY. REC ROOM. SOMEBODY.
TALK TO ME.

464
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,832
LARRY MATSON
HERE.

465
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:37,750
IS THAT YOU,
RILEY?

466
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:38,918
WHAT'S UP?

467
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,753
NOT ME.

468
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,922
I AM DOWN.

469
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,132
IN THE ENGINEERING ROOM.

470
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,218
YOU'VE BEEN
A BAD BOY.

471
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,053
MAYBE SO.

472
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,096
WHATEVER I'VE DONE,
THEY'RE SURE KEEPING IT

473
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,265
A SECRET FROM ME.

474
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,725
HEY. IS THAT
UHURA PLAYING?

475
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,352
LET ME TALK TO HER.

476
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,853
I THINK
HIS HEART IS SORE.

477
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,982
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, RILEY?

478
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,193
A SONG.

479
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,320
YEP, MAKE IT
A LOVE SONG.

480
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,447
JUST SOMETHING
TO REASSURE ME

481
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,824
I'M NOT THE ONLY
LIVING THING

482
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,077
LEFT IN

483
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,703

TO SEE THAT REPORT.

531
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:34,903
WHEN I'VE FINISHED
LOGGING IT.

532
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,113
NOW.

533
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,450
ALL RIGHT.

534
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,541
[BUZZ]

535
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,001
COME.

536
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,467
MY REPORT
ON LIEUTENANT RILEY.

537
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,593
WILL HE MAKE IT?

538
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,428
HE'S GOT
A GOOD CHANCE.

539
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,972
AND WE PREDICT
THE SAME
FOR YOU, CAPTAIN.

540
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,100
ALL RIGHT,
MR. SPOCK.
LET'S HAVE IT.

541
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,561
LIEUTENANT RILEY
WAS A WITNESS.

542
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,021
SO WERE YOU.

543
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,316
[SIGHS]

544
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,567
ALL RIGHT.

545
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,110
SOMEONE TRIED
TO KILL HIM.

546
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,654
COULD HAVE BEEN
AN ACCIDENT.

547
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,779
YOU SHOULD
BE TOLD THE DIFFERENCE

548
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,408
BETWEEN EMPIRICISM
AND STUBBORNNESS,
DOCTOR.

549
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,077
I CHECKED WITH
THE LIBRARY COMPUTER
JUST AS YOU DID.

550
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,871
I GOT THE SAME
INFORMATION.

551
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,080
AREN'T YOU GETTING
A LITTLE OUT OF LINE,
MR. SPOCK?

552
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,748
MY PERSONAL BUSINESS--

553
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,792
IT'S MY PERSONAL BUSINESS
WHEN IT MIGHT INTERFERE

554
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,877
WITH THE SMOOTH OPERATION
OF THIS SHIP.

555
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:32,919
YOU THINK
THAT HAPPENED?

556
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:33,420
IT COULD HAPPEN.

557
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,921
I DON'T LIKE
ANYONE MEDDLING

558
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:35,881
IN MY PRIVATE AFFAIRS,

559
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,174
NOT EVEN
MY SECOND IN COMMAND.

560
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,092
JIM, SPOCK'S
SIMPLY TRYING--

561
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,719
I KNOW WHAT HE'S TRYING
TO DO AND I DON'T
LIKE IT.

562
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,596
IT'S HIS JOB
AND YOU KNOW IT.

563
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,520
AND YOU ALSO KNOW...

564
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,271
THAT NOTHING IS PROVEN.

565
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,898
EVEN IN THIS CORNER
OF THE GALAXY, CAPTAIN,

566
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,900
TWO PLUS TWO
EQUALS 4.

567
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,819
ALMOST CERTAINLY AN ATTEMPT
WILL BE MADE TO KILL YOU.

568
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,363
WHY DO YOU
INVITE DEATH?

569
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,740
I'M NOT.

570
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,325
I'M INTERESTED
IN JUSTICE.

571
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,827
ARE YOU?

572
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,829
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S NOT VENGEANCE?

573
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,041
NO, I'M NOT SURE.

574
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,086
I WISH I WAS.

575
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,048
I'VE DONE THINGS
I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE.

576
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,342
I'VE PLACED MY COMMAND
IN JEOPARDY.

577
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,510
FROM HERE ON,
I'VE GOT TO DETERMINE

578
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,763
WHETHER OR NOT
KARIDIAN IS KODOS.

579
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,516
HE IS.

580
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:32,646
YOU SOUND CERTAIN.
I WISH I COULD BE.

581
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,441
BEFORE I ACCUSE A MAN OF
THAT, I'VE GOT TO BE.

582
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,860
I SAW HIM ONCE,
20 YEARS AGO.

583
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,154
MEN CHANGE.
MEMORY CHANGES.

584
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,489
LOOK AT HIM NOW--
HE'S AN ACTOR.

585
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,450
HE'LL CHANGE
HIS APPEARANCE.

586
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:49,455
NO. LOGIC IS NOT ENOUGH.

587
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,165
I'VE GOT TO FEEL MY WAY.

588
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,043
MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE.

589
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,713
WHAT IF YOU DECIDE
HE IS KODOS?
WHAT THEN?

590
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,131
DO YOU PLAY GOD,

591
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,592
CARRY HIS HEAD
THROUGH THE CORRIDORS
IN TRIUMPH?

592
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,594
THAT WON'T
BRING BACK
THE DEAD, JIM.

593
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,805
NO.

594
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,392
BUT THEY MAY
REST EASIER.

595
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,691
LOGIC, CAPTAIN.
DR. LEIGHTON
WAS MURDERED

596
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,859
WHILE
THE KARIDIAN COMPANY
WAS ON PLANET Q.

597
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,237
NOW AN ATTEMPT HAS
BEEN MADE AGAINST
LIEUTENANT RILEY

598
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,863
WHILE THE COMPANY
IS ON BOARD
THE "ENTERPRISE."

599
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,533
DOC ISN'T SURE THERE WAS
A MURDER ATTEMPT.

600
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:27,785
BESIDES,
I HAVE AN IDEA
THAT MAY PROVE--

601
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,328
SHH.
LISTEN.
[HUMMING ]

602
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,913
DO YOU HEAR IT?
THAT LOW HUM.

603
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,914
A PHASER.

604
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,915
ON OVERLOAD.

605
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,669
[HUMMING]

606
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:40,964
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

607
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,633
THERE'S A PHASER
ON OVERLOAD
IN MY QUARTERS.

608
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,384
IF IT BLOWS,
IT'LL TAKE OUT
THE ENTIRE DECK.

609
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,137
EVACUATE ALL PERSONNEL
IN THIS QUADRANT.

610
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,806
DOUBLE RED ALERT.

611
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,100
[SIREN]

612
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,143
YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

613
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,186
YOU CAN'T STAY.

614
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,813
GO ON. BLOCK OFF
THIS SECTION.

615
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,023
HURRY.
I'LL FIND IT.

616
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,733
EVACUATE THIS SECTION.
SEAL IT OFF.

617
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,901
CLEAR SECTION C4 AND C5.

618
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,105
[EXPLOSION]

619
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,527
[SIREN STOPS]

620
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,637
[DOOR OPENS]

621
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,560
WE'RE OVERDUE
FOR OUR TALK,
AREN'T WE?

622
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,854
I HAD HOPED
YOU WOULD HAVE RESPECTED
MY PRIVACY, CAPTAIN.

623
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,939
A MOMENT AGO,
WE NARROWLY AVERTED
AN EXPLOSION

624
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,901
WHICH WOULD HAVE
DESTROYED SEVERAL DECKS
OF THIS SHIP.

625
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,904
BEFORE THAT,
SOMEONE TRIED TO POISON
ONE OF MY CREWMEN.

626
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:27,987
I AM SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

627
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,782
I'M SURE YOU ARE.

628
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,243
ARE YOU KODOS?

629
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,708
I ASKED YOU
A QUESTION.

630
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,209
DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT I AM?

631
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,211
I DO.

632
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,380
THEN I AM KODOS,

633
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,257
IF IT PLEASES YOU
TO BELIEVE SO.

634
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,761
I AM AN ACTOR.

635
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,178
I PLAY MANY PARTS.

636
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,097
YOU'RE AN ACTOR NOW.

637
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,808
WHAT WERE YOU
20 YEARS AGO?

638
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,645
YOUNGER, CAPTAIN.

639
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,648
MUCH YOUNGER.

640
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:04,566
SO WAS I.

641
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:08,654
BUT I REMEMBER.

642
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,660
LET'S SEE IF YOU DO.

643
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,579
READ THIS
INTO THAT COMMUNICATOR
ON THE WALL.

644
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,706
IT WILL BE RECORDED

645
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:23,585
AND COMPARED TO A PIECE
OF KODOS VOICE FILM
WE HAVE IN OUR FILES.

646
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,295
THE TEST
IS VIRTUALLY INFALLIBLE.

647
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,006
IT WILL TELL US WHETHER
YOU'RE KARIDIAN...

648
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,217
OR KODOS
THE EXECUTIONER.

649
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,724
READY FOR VOICE TEST.

650
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,685
DISGUISING YOUR VOICE
WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE.

651
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,066
"THE REVOLUTION...

652
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,903
"IS SUCCESSFUL,

659
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,003
THEREFORE
I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE

660
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,254
BUT TO SENTENCE YOU
TO DEATH.

661
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,965

IS SO ORDERED.

662
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,758
SIGNED, KODOS,

00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,803
GOVERNOR OF TARSUS IV.

664
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,304
I REMEMBER THE WORDS.

665
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,514
I WROTE THEM DOWN.

666
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,061
YOU SAID THEM
LIKE YOU KNEW THEM.

667
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,313
YOU HARDLY GLANCED
AT THE PAPER.

668
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,106
I LEARN MY PARTS
VERY QUICKLY.

669
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,483
ARE YOU SURE?

670
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,860
ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T
ACT THIS ROLE OUT

671
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:30,736
IN FRONT OF
A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE

672
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,530
WHOM YOU BLASTED
OUT OF EXISTENCE
WITHOUT MERCY?

673
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,700
I FIND YOUR USE
OF THE WORD "MERCY"

674
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,577
STRANGELY INAPPROPRIATE,
CAPTAIN.

675
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,373
HERE YOU STAND,
A PERFECT SYMBOL

676
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:49,796
OF OUR TECHNICAL SOCIETY--
MECHANIZED, ELECTRONICIZED,

677
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,172
AND NOT VERY HUMAN.

678
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,636
YOU'VE DONE AWAY
WITH HUMANITY,

679
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,848
THE STRIVING OF MAN
TO ACHIEVE GREATNESS

680
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,100
THROUGH HIS OWN
RESOURCES.

681
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,519
WE'VE ARMED MAN
WITH TOOLS.

682
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,396
THE STRIVING
FOR GREATNESS CONTINUES.
BUT KODOS--

683
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,066
KODOS, WHOEVER HE WAS--
OR IS.

684
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,442
OR IS.

685
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,531
KODOS MADE A DECISION
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

686
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,534
SOME HAD TO DIE
THAT OTHERS MIGHT LIVE.

687
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,827
YOU'RE A MAN OF DECISION,
CAPTAIN.

688
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,079
YOU OUGHT TO
UNDERSTAND THAT.

689
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,705
ALL I UNDERSTAND

690
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,584
IS THAT 4,000 PEOPLE
WERE NEEDLESSLY
BUTCHERED.

691
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,712
IN ORDER TO SAVE
4,000 OTHERS.

692
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,463
AND IF THE SUPPLY SHIPS

693
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,340
HADN'T COME EARLIER
THAN EXPECTED,

694
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,051
THIS KODOS OF YOURS
MIGHT HAVE GONE DOWN
IN HISTORY

695
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,010
AS A GREAT HERO.

696
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,386
BUT HE DIDN'T.

697
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,973
AND HISTORY
HAS MADE ITS JUDGMENT.

698
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:43,767
IF YOU'RE SO SURE
THAT I'M KODOS,

699
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,727
WHY NOT KILL ME NOW?

700
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,815
LET BLOODY VENGEANCE
TAKE ITS FINAL COURSE!

701
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,857
AND SEE
WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES

702
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,901
TO THIS UNIVERSE
OF YOURS.

703
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,319
THOSE ARE
BEAUTIFUL WORDS,

704
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,279
WELL ACTED.

705
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,823
THEY CHANGE NOTHING.

706
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,783
NO, I SUPPOSE NOT.

707
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,618
THEY'RE MERELY TOOLS,

708
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:02,953
LIKE THIS SHIP OF YOURS.

709
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,830
THERE ARE NO
PREVIOUS RECORDS

710
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,081
TO ANTON KARIDIAN

711
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,874
PRIOR TO
20 YEARS AGO.

712
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,378
BLOOD THINS.

713
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,798
THE BODY FAILS.

714
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,717
ONE IS FINALLY GRATEFUL

715
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,427
FOR A FAILING MEMORY.

716
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,058
I NO LONGER
TREASURE LIFE,

717
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,643
NOT EVEN MY OWN.

718
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,606
I AM TIRED!

719
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,321
THE PAST...

720
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,406
IS A BLANK.

721
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,998
DID YOU GET
EVERYTHING YOU...

722
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,416
WANTED,
CAPTAIN KIRK?

723
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,751
IF I HAD GOTTEN...

724
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,755
EVERYTHING I WANTED...

725
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,218
YOU MIGHT NOT WALK
OUT OF THIS ROOM ALIVE.

726
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,930
CAPTAIN KIRK.

727
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,145
YOU BETTER REST...

728
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,312
NOW.

729
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,572
THERE'S
A STAIN OF CRUELTY

730
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:23,324
ON YOUR
SHINING ARMOR,
CAPTAIN.

731
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,827
YOU COULD HAVE
SPARED HIM...

732
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,037
AND ME.

733
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,666
YOU TALKED
OF USING TOOLS.

734
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,418
I WAS A TOOL,
WASN'T I?

735
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,462
A TOOL TO USE
AGAINST MY FATHER.

736
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,756
IN THE BEGINNING,
PERHAPS.

737
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,053
BUT LATER, I WANTED IT
TO BE MORE THAN THAT.

738
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:46,890
LATER. EVERYTHING'S
ALWAYS LATER.

739
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:52,145
LATER. LATEST.
TOO LATE.

740
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,354
TOO LATE, CAPTAIN.

741
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,861
YOU ARE
LIKE YOUR SHIP--

742
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,821
POWERFUL...

743
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,990
AND NOT HUMAN.

744
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,743
THERE IS NO MERCY
IN YOU.

745
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,454
IF HE IS KODOS,

746
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,124
THEN I'VE SHOWN HIM
MORE MERCY THAN
HE DESERVES.

747
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,043
AND IF HE ISN'T...

748
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,089
THEN WE'LL
LET YOU OFF
AT BENECIA,

749
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,091
AND NO HARM DONE.

750
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,804
CAPTAIN KIRK.

751
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,015
WHO ARE YOU TO SAY
WHAT HARM WAS DONE?

752
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,103
WHO DO I HAVE TO BE?

753
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,525
MEDICAL LOG--

754
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,611
LIEUTENANT RILEY'S
SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED

755
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,487
TO BE DISCHARGED,

756
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,863
BUT THE CAPTAIN
HAS ORDERED HIM

757
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,406
RESTRICTED TO SICK BAY

758
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,325
TO PREVENT
CONTACT WITH PASSENGER

759
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,910
WHO CALLS HIMSELF
KARIDIAN

760
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,538
AND WHO'S SUSPECTED
OF BEING KODOS
THE EXECUTIONER

761
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,374
AND OF MURDERING
THE LIEUTENANT'S FAMILY.

762
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,305
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG--
STARDATE 2819.8.

763
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,765
SUSPECT UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

764
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,101
STRATEGIC AREAS
UNDER DOUBLE GUARD.

765
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,227
PERFORMANCE OF
THE KARIDIAN PLAYERS

766
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,229
TAKING PLACE AS SCHEDULED.

767
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,900
[FANFARE PLAYS]

768
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,114
TONIGHT, THE KARIDIAN PLAYERS

769
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,991
PRESENT "HAMLET,"

770
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,826
ANOTHER IN A SERIES
OF LIVING PLAYS

771
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,369
PRESENTED IN SPACE,

772
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,664
DEDICATED TO THE TRADITION
OF CLASSIC THEATER.

773
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,166
"HAMLET" IS A VIOLENT PLAY

774
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,668
ABOUT VIOLENT TIMES

775
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,212
WHEN LIFE WAS CHEAP

776
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:41,587
AND AMBITION WAS GOD.

777
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,014
I BELIEVE
WE HAVE A MATCH,
CAPTAIN.

778
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,850
BUT NOT
AN EXACT MATCH,
MR. SPOCK.

779
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,730
WE'RE DEALING
WITH A MAN'S LIFE.

780
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,274
NO MACHINE
CAN MAKE THAT DECISION.

781
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,775
IN THE LONG HISTORY
OF MEDICINE,

782
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,985
NO DOCTOR
HAS EVER CAUGHT

783
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,320
THE FIRST FEW MINUTES
OF A PLAY.

784
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,280
RILEY, DON'T
FORGET THAT--

785
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:11,576
RILEY?

786
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,998
CAPTAIN KIRK,
McCOY HERE.
Kirk: YES, DOCTOR.

787
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,791
RILEY'S GONE.
I WAS RECORDING MY LOG

788
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,001
ABOUT KARIDIAN AND KODOS.

789
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:20,877
IF HE OVERHEARD--

790
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,295
YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT,
DOCTOR.

791
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,298
CAPTAIN,
SECURITY, "H" DECK--

792
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,550
THE WEAPONS LOCKER
HAS BEEN BROKEN INTO.

793
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,844
ONE PHASER IS MISSING.

794
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,054
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

795
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,390
SECURITY 2 ALERT.

796
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,350
FIND AND RESTRAIN
LIEUTENANT KEVIN RILEY.

797
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,268
HE'S ARMED
AND POSSIBLY HEADED

798
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,228
TOWARDS THE SHIP'S THEATER.

799
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,208
WHITHER WILT THOU LEAD ME?

800
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,627
SPEAK, I'LL GO NO FURTHER.

801
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,754
MARK ME.

802
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,214
Hamlet: I WILL.

803
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,801
MY HOUR IS ALMOST COME,

804
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:13,638
WHEN I TO SULPHUROUS
AND TORMENTING FIRES

805
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:17,683
MUST RENDER UP MYSELF.

806
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,228
Hamlet: SPEAK.
I AM BOUND TO HEAR.

807
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:23,731
SO ART THOU
TO REVENGE...

808
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,026
WHEN THOU SHALT HEAR.

809
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:31,197
I AM THY FATHER'S
SPIRIT,

810
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:32,949
DOOMED
FOR A CERTAIN TERM

811
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,451
TO WALK THE NIGHT...

812
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,619
RILEY...

813
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,996
GET BACK
TO THE SICK BAY.

814
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,251
HE MURDERED MY FATHER...

815
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,128
AND MY MOTHER.

816
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,255
YOU COULD BE WRONG.

817
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,174
DON'T THROW AWAY
YOUR LIFE
ON A MISTAKE.

818
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,343
I'M NOT WRONG.

819
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,636
BUT THAT I AM FORBID
TO TELL THE SECRETS

820
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,055
OF MY PRISON-HOUSE...

821
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,266
I KNOW THAT VOICE.

822
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,143
THAT FACE,
I KNOW IT.

823
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,061
I SAW IT.

824
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,813
HE MURDERED THEM.

825
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,483
THY SOUL,

826
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,235
FREEZE THY YOUNG BLOOD.

827
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,240
IT'S AN ORDER.

828
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,826
GIVE ME THE WEAPON.

829
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:17,994
IF THOU DIDST EVER

830
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,579
THY DEAR FATHER LOVE...

831
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,499
GET BACK
TO THE SICK BAY.

832
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,958
GO ON.

833
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,504
[APPLAUSE]

834
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:38,890
IT'S GOING BEAUTIFULLY.

835
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:39,849
WHAT IS IT?

836
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,393
WHAT'S WRONG?

837
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:42,894
THERE WAS A VOICE
OUT OF THE PAST

838
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,354
HAUNTING ME,

839
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:45,730
TORTURING ME.

840
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,649
THERE WAS ANOTHER PART
I ONCE PLAYED LONG AGO.

841
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,484
I NEVER TOLD YOU
ABOUT IT.

842
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,028
NOW THAT SAME CURTAIN
RISES AGAIN.

843
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:52,862
THE TIME HAS COME.

844
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,489
NO, FATHER.

845
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,782
THE TIME
WILL NEVER COME.

846
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,034
TONIGHT,

847
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,245
AFTER MY PERFORMANCE,

848
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,330
THE LAST TWO
WHO CAN HARM YOU

849
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,417
WILL BE GONE.

850
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:06,959
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

851
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,461
THERE WERE 9.

852
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,171
NOW THERE ARE ONLY TWO,

853
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,549
AND THEY WILL BE GONE
AS SOON AS I.

854
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,515
DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT.

855
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,641
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

856
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,643
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE.

857
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,479
THEY HAD TO BE
SILENCED.

858
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,565
ALL OF THEM?

859
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,442
ALL 7?

860
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,859
MORE BLOOD
ON MY HANDS?

861
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,237
NO, FATHER.
NOT ANYMORE.

862
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,905
I'M STRONG, FATHER.

863
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,156
IT'S NOTHING.

864
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:39,033
Stagehand:
SECOND ACT--
3 MINUTES.

865
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,826
WE'LL BE READY.

866
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,745
DON'T YOU SEE?

867
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,663
ALL THE GHOSTS ARE DEAD.

868
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,624
I'VE BURIED THEM.

869
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,004
THERE'S NO MORE BLOOD
ON YOUR HANDS.

870
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,047
OH, MY CHILD.

871
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,425
MY CHILD.

872
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,760
YOU'VE LEFT ME
NOTHING!

873
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,808
YOU WERE THE ONE THING
IN MY LIFE

874
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:06,561
UNTOUCHED
BY WHAT I'D DONE.

875
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,480
BUT YOU'RE SAFE NOW,
FATHER.

876
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,149
I'VE SAVED YOU.

877
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,777
NOW...

878
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,946
NO ONE CAN TOUCH YOU.

879
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,619
NOT EVEN CAPTAIN KIRK.

880
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,541
SEE CAESAR COME.

881
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,547
HE'S AWED
BY YOUR GREATNESS...

882
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,472
YOUR SHINING
BRIGHTNESS.

883
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:49,437
BRIGHT AS A BLADE...

884
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,981
BEFORE IT IS
STAINED WITH BLOOD.

885
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,110
BRIGHT AS A BLADE.

886
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,195
COME WITH ME,

887
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:57,903
BOTH OF YOU.

888
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,156
OF COURSE.

889
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,698
AFTER THE PLAY.

890
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,326
THE PLAY IS OVER.

891
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,036
IT'S BEEN OVER
FOR 20 YEARS.

892
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,330
I WAS A SOLDIER
IN A CAUSE.

893
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,332
THERE WERE THINGS
TO BE DONE.
TERRIBLE THINGS.

894
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,375
STOP IT, FATHER!

895
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,127
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO JUSTIFY.

896
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,463
MURDER, FLIGHT,

897
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,841
SUICIDE, MADNESS.

898
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,010
I NEVER WANTED
THE BLOOD ON MY HANDS

899
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,679
EVER TO STAIN YOU.

900
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,971
I DID IT FOR YOU.

901
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,306
I'VE SAVED YOU.

902
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,141
BY KILLING
7 INNOCENT MEN.

903
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,435
THEY WEREN'T INNOCENT!

904
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,604
THEY WERE DANGEROUS!

905
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:32,605
I WOULD HAVE
KILLED A WORLD

906
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:33,648
TO SAVE HIM!

907
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,150
Stagehand:
CURTAIN GOING UP--
ONE MINUTE.

908
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:39,987
THE PLAY, CAPTAIN.

909
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,822
HE MUST GO ON.

910
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,910
THIS IS THE GREAT...

911
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,828
KARIDIAN.

912
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,372
GUARD.

913
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,375
YOU CANNOT DENY HIM
HIS LAST PERFORMANCE!

914
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,504
LENORE, DON'T!

915
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,297
AAH!
AAH!

916
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,885
YOU'LL NEVER
GET OFF THE SHIP.

917
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,389
THEN IT WILL BECOME
FLOATING, TOO,

918
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,183
DRIFTING THROUGH SPACE

919
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,519
WITH THE SOUL
OF THE GREAT KARIDIAN

920
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:12,937
GIVING PERFORMANCES

921
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:15,273
AT EVERY STAR HE TOUCHES.

922
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,448
I KNOW HOW
TO USE THIS, CAPTAIN.

923
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:25,908
NO.

924
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,826
CAESAR,

925
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,246
BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH.

926
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,623
NO, CHILD! DON'T!

927
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:32,624
UHH!

928
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,420
AAH!

929
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:43,468
FATHER.

930
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:48,389
FATHER.

931
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,768
O...

932
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:52,809
PROUD...

933
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:53,645
DEATH!

934
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,022
WHAT FEAST IS TOWARD

935
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,525
IN THINE ETERNAL CELL...

936
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:04,113
THAT THOU,
SUCH A PRINCE,

937
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,532
AT A SHOT SO BLOODILY

938
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:08,534
HAST STRUCK?

939
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,995
[SOBBING]

940
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,626
THE CURT--
THE CURTAIN.

941
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,003
THE CURTAIN RISES.

942
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,716
IT RISES.

943
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:28,680
'TIS NO TIME TO SLEEP.

944
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,933
THE PLAY.

945
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,645
THE PLAY.

946
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:40,274
THE PLAY'S THE THING...

947
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:46,405
WHEREIN WE'LL CATCH
THE CONSCIENCE OF THE KING.

948
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:20,815
MEDICAL REPORT.

949
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,650
[BEEP]

950
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,111
SHE'LL RECEIVE
THE BEST OF CARE, JIM.

951
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,613
SHE REMEMBERS NOTHING.

952
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,866
SHE EVEN THINKS
HER FATHER'S STILL ALIVE

953
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,410
GIVING PERFORMANCES
BEFORE CHEERING CROWDS.

954
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,249
YOU REALLY
CARED FOR HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

955
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:40,917
READY TO LEAVE
BENECIA ORBIT,
CAPTAIN.

956
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,254

00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,130
ALL CHANNELS CLEARED,
UHURA?

958
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,132
ALL CHANNELS CLEAR, SIR.

959
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,551
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY,
MR. LESLIE.

960
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,679
LEAVING ORBIT,
SIR.

961
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,014
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
ANSWER MY QUESTION,
ARE YOU?

962
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,936
AHEAD WARP FACTOR 1,
MR. LESLIE.

963
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,610
THAT'S AN ANSWER.
