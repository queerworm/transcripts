00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,150
WELL, MR. SPOCK?

2
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,319
VERY TYPICAL, CAPTAIN.

5
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,576

WHAT WAS THAT?

17
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:18,913
WHAT MY INSTRUMENTS READ
IS TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE,

18
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,540

I WANT FACTS,
NOT POETRY.

22
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,463
I HAVE GIVEN YOU
THE FACTS, CAPTAIN.

23
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,506
THE ENTIRE
MAGNETIC FIELD

24
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,426

ATTAINED ZERO GRAVITY.

27
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,266
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

28
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,685
WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING...

29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,645
IS NONEXISTENCE.

00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,941
IT IS APPARENTLY HUMAN,
CAPTAIN.

43
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:35,489

COINCIDED WITH THIS
COSMIC WINKING OUT?

44
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:36,991
ALMOST TO THE SECOND.

45
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,450

COULD THIS BEING
PRESENT ANY DANGER
TO THE SHIP?

49
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,666
POSSIBLE.

50
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,252

THAT PHENOMENON WAS,

84
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,489
IT DRAINED ALMOST ALL OF
OUR CRYSTALS COMPLETELY.

85
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,699
IT COULD MEAN TROUBLE.

86
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,076

174
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,923
THING...DESTROYED
YOUR ENTIRE CIVILIZATION.

175
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,426
TO THE LAST MAN,
WOMAN, AND CHILD.

176
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,927
HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?

177
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,764
I WAS INSPECTING
MAGNETIC COMMUNICATIONS
SATELLITES.

178
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,601
YOU BELIEVE ME,
DON'T YOU?

179
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,355
BEFORE WE PICKED YOU UP,

180
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,066
OUR SHIP SUSTAINED A NUMBER
OF INCREDIBLE EFFECTS.

181
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,234
THAT WAS HE!

182
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,194
HE'S DEATH...ANTILIFE.

183
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,613
HE LIVES TO DESTROY!

184
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,242
IS HE THE THING
THAT ATTACKED YOU?

185
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,995
YES.
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

186
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,915
I SWEAR IT.

187
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,546
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER FACTS,
ANY INFORMATION.

188
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,133
THEN YOU'LL JOIN ME
IN MY HOLY CAUSE.

189
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,803
HELP ME
IN VISITING JUSTICE
AND VENGEANCE UPON HIM?

190
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,639
MY ONLY CAUSE IS
THE SAFETY OF MY SHIP

191
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,475
AND THE MISSION WE'RE ON.

192
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,854
YOU'LL BEAM DOWN
WITH ME.

193
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,149
I'LL CHECK YOUR STORY OUT.

194
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,741

FIND ANYTHING?

195
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,327
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.

196
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,828
ANYTHING FROM OUR GUEST?

197
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,580
ACCORDING TO HIM,
THERE'S A CREATURE
OF SOME SORT DOWN HERE,

198
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,081
A HUMANOID.

199
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,583
LIEUTENANT UHURA
COMMUNICATED THAT INFORMATION.

200
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,709
I ORDERED RECONFIRMATION
ON OUR SENSORS.

201
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:13,256
THEY INDICATE NO LIVING
CREATURE ON THIS PLANET.

202
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,674
I SUGGEST, CAPTAIN,
THAT YOU'VE BEEN LIED TO.

203
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:21,515
CAPTAIN, YOU YOURSELF SAID
THERE WERE NO OTHER
EXPLANATIONS.

204
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,766
WHY DO YOU GIVE
CREDENCE TO THIS MAN?

205
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,727
I FAIL TO COMPREHEND
YOUR INDIGNATION, SIR.

206
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:31,483
I HAVE SIMPLY MADE
THE LOGICAL DEDUCTION
THAT YOU ARE A LIAR.

207
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,985
LET'S HAVE IT.
THE TRUTH THIS TIME.

<i>WE'LL FINISH IT!</i>

213
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,079
CAN YOU IDENTIFY THAT?

214
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,789
I'M TRYING, CAPTAIN.

215
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:47,957

00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,792

218
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,550
YOU CAN'T RUN!
IT'LL DO YOU NO GOOD!

219
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:00,637
I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE
VERY FIRES OF HELL!

220
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,892

WHAT HAPPENED?

221
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,019
I SAW IT AGAIN,
THE THING.

222
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,772
IT ATTACKED ME.

223
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,607
I'LL HELP YOU
GET OUT OF HERE.

224
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,942

THIS VERY SPOT.

00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,114

ALL WHITE, BLACK...

229
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,161

A TERRIBLE EMPTINESS.

230
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,078
LET'S GET BACK
TO THE SHIP.

231
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,580
HE'LL KILL US ALL

232
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,372

KILL HIM FIRST!

THE OCCURRENCE OF

THAN I CAN THE FIRST.

TO WHAT LAZARUS SAID?

THAT A SINGLE CREATURE,

00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,051

OF SUCH MAGNITUDE?

250
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,386

00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,816
HE HAS NO

KNOW FOR CERTAIN

260
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,110
THAT THE OCCURRENCE
OF THE PHENOMENON

261
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,822
COINCIDES EXACTLY
WITH THE MOMENTS

262
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,074
THAT LAZARUS HAS
HIS ALLEGED CONFRONTATIONS.

I DON'T KNOW, JIM.

266
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,502
MAYBE
I'M IMAGINING THINGS,

00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,421
AND MAYBE I'M NOT.
YOU TELL ME.

268
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,839
YOU TELL ME.
THAT'S WHY YOU
BROUGHT ME DOWN HERE.

269
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,466
WELL, AS YOU KNOW,
WE BOTH BROUGHT
LAZARUS IN HERE.

RIGHT.

NOT EVEN A BRUISE.

NEVER BEEN INJURED.

00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,289

00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,099
I BEG OF YOU.

346
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,309
I PLEAD.

347
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,061
I DEMAND.

348
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,146
GIVE ME THE CRYSTALS.

349
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,356
OUT OF
THE QUESTION.

350
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,151
THOSE CRYSTALS ARE
THE VERY HEART OF
THE POWER MY SHIP.

351
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,028
YOU FOOL.

352
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,865
THERE WON'T BE ANY SHIP
IF WE DON'T KILL HIM.

353
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,740
HE'LL DESTROY YOU ALL.

354
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,993
HOW?

355
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,703
NOW, YOU TELL ME HOW!

356
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,455
ALL I'VE HEARD FROM
YOU IS DOUBLE-TALK,
LIES, THREATS,

357
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,541
ACCUSATIONS
THAT DON'T HOLD
AN OUNCE OF WATER.

358
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,211
NOW, YOU TELL ME,
HOW DOES IT PRESENT
A DANGER TO MY SHIP?

359
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,880
I WARN YOU,
CAPTAIN.

360
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,965
YOU'LL GIVE ME
THE CRYSTALS.

361
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,009
DON'T THREATEN
ME, LAZARUS.

362
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,094
NO THREAT INTENDED.

363
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,225
CAPTAIN...

364
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,272
I'LL HAVE MY VENGEANCE.

365
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,189
LIEUTENANT MASTERS,
CAPTAIN'S CALLING.

366
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,698
MASTERS HERE.

367
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,326
[KIRK]
<i>LIEUTENANT, CAN YOU</i>
<i>PREPARE AN EXPERIMENTATION</i>
<i>CHAMBER IN 10 MINUTES?</i>

368
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,369
<i>ALL DILITHIUM</i>
<i>CRYSTALS FULL POWER.</i>

369
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,205
I'LL CHECK, SIR.

370
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,639
CAPTAIN, THE CHAMBER
WILL BE READY IN
10 MINUTES, SIR.

371
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,016
MY ASSISTANT AND I WILL--

372
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,391
CAPTAIN!

373
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,643
CAPTAIN!

374
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,603
<i>LIEUTENANT, WHAT IS IT?</i>
<i>WHAT'S WRONG?</i>

375
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,646
<i>LIEUTENANT? LIEUTENANT?</i>

376
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,191
CAPTAIN,
SECURITY REPORTS
LAZARUS MISSING.

377
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,117
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 3088.7.</i>

378
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,286
<i>WE ARE NO CLOSER</i>
<i>TO FINDING AN ANSWER</i>

379
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,121
<i>TO THE STRANGE PHENOMENON</i>

380
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,831
<i>THAN WE WERE</i>
<i>AT THE BEGINNING.</i>

381
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,749
<i>NOT ONLY HAVE TWO OF MY</i>
<i>CREWMEN BEEN ATTACKED,</i>

382
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,127
<i>TWO OF OUR DILITHIUM</i>
<i>CRYSTALS ARE MISSING,</i>

383
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,213
<i>AND WITHOUT THEM,</i>

384
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:03,216
<i>THE</i> ENTERPRISE<i> CANNOT</i>
<i>OPERATE AT FULL POWER.</i>

385
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,842
<i>THEY MUST BE FOUND.</i>

386
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,427
FACT--YOU SAID YOU
NEEDED THE CRYSTALS.

387
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,848
FACT--AN HOUR AFTER YOU
SAID YOU MUST HAVE THEM,
THEY WERE MISSING.

388
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,808
FACT--TWO OF MY CREWMEN
WERE ATTACKED.

389
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,519
AND FACT, CAPTAIN--
I DIDN'T TAKE THE CRYSTALS.

390
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,980
I'M NOT THE ONE.

391
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,233
FIND MY ENEMY.

392
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,234
FIND THE BEAST,

393
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,610
AND YOU'LL
FIND THE CRYSTALS.

394
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,321
HOW DID THIS BEAST
GET ABOARD MY SHIP?

395
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,323
HE DID.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

396
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,782
NO. HE DIDN'T
TRANSPORT UP.

397
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,326
A REPORT WOULD
HAVE BEEN MADE.

398
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,203
I TELL YOU, WE'RE
DEALING WITH A CREATURE

399
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,996
CAPABLE OF
DESTROYING WORLDS.

400
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:38,000
WHY DOES HE
NEED THE CRYSTALS?

401
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,417
FOR WHAT REASON?

402
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,628
FOR THE SAME REASON
THAT I DO.

403
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,130
LISTEN TO ME.

404
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,258
HE'S HUMANOID.

405
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,217
WHY, HE...

406
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,136
HE CAN PILOT
A SPACESHIP.

407
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,306
HE CAN COMPUTE FORMULAS
TO DESTROY RACES.

408
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,267
HE CAN STEAL AN ENERGY
SOURCE FOR HIS VEHICLE

409
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:57,519
SO HE CAN ESCAPE FROM ME.

410
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,400
ARE YOU DEAF
AS WELL AS BLIND?

411
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,567
SIT DOWN.

412
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,696
THE CRYSTALS
CERTAINLY AREN'T HERE.

413
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,283
THERE'S AN UNEXPLAINED
RADIATION SOURCE
ON THE PLANET.

414
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,159
OBVIOUSLY
SOME CONNECTION.

415
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,827
WE'LL CHECK IT OUT.

416
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,829
ORGANIZE A SEARCH PARTY
IMMEDIATELY.

417
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,249
MR. LAZARUS WILL
BEAM DOWN WITH US.

418
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,209
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

419
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:23,254
YOU MAY NOT HAVE
REASON TO THANK ME,

420
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,464
DEPENDING ON
WHAT WE FIND.

421
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,762
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE NOW,
CAPTAIN?

422
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,682
I BELIEVE
THE MISSING CRYSTALS
AREN'T IN YOUR SHIP.

423
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,018
MR. SPOCK?

424
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,229
UNABLE TO LOCATE
THE SOURCE OF RADIATION.

425
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,522
WHY NOT? YOU HAD IT
SPOTTED FROM THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

426
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,651
IT HAS SIMPLY
DISAPPEARED, CAPTAIN.

427
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,195
I WANT EVERY INCH OF
THIS TERRAIN CHECKED.

428
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,823
LOOK FOR FOOTPRINT,
MOVEMENT--ANYTHING.

429
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,490
CALL OUT IF YOU
SPOT ANYTHING.

430
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,577
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO USE YOUR WEAPONS.

431
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,543
[THUNDER]

432
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,472
[THUNDER]

433
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:45,479
[THUNDER STOPS]

434
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,715
CAPTAIN, LOOK OUT!

435
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,634
AAH!

436
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,595
[THUD]

437
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,535
HE'S COMING
OUT OF IT NOW.

438
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,537
UH, THE THING...

439
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,455
THE THING...

440
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,914
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

441
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,167
YOU'RE ON BOARD
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

442
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,418
THE ROCK, I--

443
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:50,544
HOW'S YOUR HEAD?

444
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,921
ACHES.

445
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,882
YOU SAVED MY
LIFE DOWN THERE.

446
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,010
I WANT TO THANK YOU.

447
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,596
WHY SHOULDN'T I?

448
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,722
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
I WANT TO ASK YOU.

449
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,057
NOT NOW, JIM.

450
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:04,933
IT'S NECESSARY.

451
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,477
GO AHEAD.

452
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,646
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

453
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,733
THIS IS
A COMPUTER REPORT

454
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,735
OF THE EVIDENCE
YOU GAVE

455
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,030
AT YOUR FIRST
SCREENING.

456
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,782
IT CALLS YOU
A LIAR, LAZARUS.

457
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,744
FOR ONE THING,
THERE'S NO PLANET
AT THE LOCATION

458
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,746
YOU SAID
YOU CAME FROM.

459
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,832
THERE NEVER
HAS BEEN.

460
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,419
IF YOU WANT
HELP FROM US,

461
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:35,005
YOU BETTER START
TELLING THE TRUTH.

462
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,840
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME
IF I TOLD YOU.

463
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,634
TRY US.

464
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,596
ALL RIGHT.

465
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,475
I DISTORTED A FACT

466
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,436
IN THE INTEREST
OF SELF-PRESERVATION,

467
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,937
FOR MY HOLY CAUSE.

468
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,939
I NEEDED HELP,

469
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,525
NOT CENSURE,

470
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,737
FREEDOM, NOT CAPTIVITY
FOR BEING A MADMAN.

471
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,781
I WAS AFRAID THAT'S
WHAT YOU'D CALL ME

472
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:05,827
IF I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

473
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:06,704
I'LL HAVE THE TRUTH NOW.

474
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,039
MY PLANET...

475
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,083
MY EARTH...

476
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,044
OR WHAT'S LEFT OF IT,

477
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,090
IS DOWN THERE BENEATH US.

478
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,007
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

479
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,302
MY SPACESHIP...

480
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,180
IS MORE THAT JUST THAT.

481
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,140
IT'S A TIME CHAMBER...

482
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,018
A TIME SHIP...

483
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,688
AND I...

484
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,148
I AM A TIME TRAVELER.

485
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,029
AND THIS THING
YOU SEARCH FOR

486
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,616
IS A
TIME TRAVELER, TOO?

487
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,786
OH, YES.

488
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,873
HE'S FLED ME ACROSS
ALL THE YEARS...

489
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,377
ALL THE EMPTY YEARS
TO A DEAD FUTURE...

490
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:59,381
ON A MURDERED PLANET
HE DESTROYED.

491
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,509
HELP ME!

492
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:05,178
GIVE ME THE TOOLS
I NEED TO KILL HIM!
THE CRYSTALS!

493
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,805
DON'T LET HIM
GET AWAY!

494
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,683
LAZARUS, YOU'VE
BEEN HURT, I KNOW.

495
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,977
I SYMPATHIZE
WITH YOU,

496
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,688
BUT I'VE GOT 430
OTHER MEN TO WORRY
ABOUT.

497
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,064
NOW, WHERE ARE
THOSE CRYSTALS?

498
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,566
I TOLD YOU.

499
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,443
HE'S GOT THEM.
HE TOOK THEM.

500
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,486
THE THING...

501
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,321
HE'S GOT
TO GET SOME
REST, JIM.

502
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,030
AND WOULD YOU GET
THAT MUSCLEMAN

503
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,449
OUT OF
MY SICK BAY?

504
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,451
DISMISSED.

505
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,203
HE'S IN
A LOT OF PAIN.

506
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,956
SOMETIMES PAIN CAN
DRIVE A MAN HARDER
THAN PLEASURE.

507
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,083
I'M SURE YOU
KNOW THAT, DOCTOR.

508
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:39,087
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE,

509
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,298
NOT THIS TIME.

510
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,286
OH!

511
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,960
[LAZARUS GROANS]

512
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,851
WHAT HAVE WE GOT,
MR. SPOCK?

513
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,396
A MAGNETIC EFFECT
WHICH PRODUCES
A WINKING-OUT PHENOMENON,

514
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,315
A MYSTERIOUS,
UNIDENTIFIED SOURCE

515
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,317
OF RADIATION
ON THE PLANET,

516
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,237
LAZARUS, A WALKING
POWDER KEG,

517
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,239
YOUR RIP
IN THE UNIVERSE,

518
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,241
A SO-CALLED
MURDERING HUMANOID--

519
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,744
TRUE, CAPTAIN, BUT
MORE SIGNIFICANT TO ME

520
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:53,871
IS THE FACT THAT
OUR SHIP'S INSTRUMENTS

521
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,289
ARE SPECIFICALLY
DESIGNED TO LOCATE
AND IDENTIFY

522
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,166
ANY OBJECT
IN OUR UNIVERSE,

523
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,168
BE IT ENERGY
OR MATTER.

524
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,254
BUT BY USING
THOSE INSTRUMENTS,

525
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,296
YOU WERE UNABLE
TO IDENTIFY

526
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,382
THE SOURCE
OF THE RADIATION.

527
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:08,552
CORRECT...
WHICH WOULD SEEM
TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.

528
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,055
ARE THE INSTRUMENTS
IN ORDER?

529
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,515
PERFECT WORKING
CONDITION.

530
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,852
THEN WHAT YOU SAY
LEADS OBVIOUSLY...

531
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,604
TO ONE ALTERNATIVE.

532
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:23,316
THE SOURCE OF RADIATION IS
NOT FROM OUR UNIVERSE.

533
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,611
NOR IN OUR
UNIVERSE, CAPTAIN.

534
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,905
IT CAME FROM OUTSIDE.

535
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,490
OUTSIDE...

536
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,244
YES...

537
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,038
THAT WOULD
EXPLAIN A LOT.

538
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,250
ANOTHER UNIVERSE...

539
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,212
PERHAPS IN
ANOTHER DIMENSION...

540
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,049
OCCUPYING
THE SAME SPACE
AT THE SAME TIME.

541
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,886
POSSIBLE EXISTENCE
OF A PARALLEL UNIVERSE

542
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,180
HAS BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY
CONCEDED, CAPTAIN.

543
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,476
ALL RIGHT.

544
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,313
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF...

545
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,273
ANOTHER UNIVERSE,

546
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,233
SAY A MINUS UNIVERSE,

547
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,278
CAME INTO CONTACT
WITH A POSITIVE UNIVERSE

548
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,863
SUCH AS OURS?

549
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,324
UNQUESTIONABLY
A WARP,

550
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,285
A DISTORTION
OF PHYSICAL LAWS

551
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,453
ON AN IMMENSE SCALE.

552
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,456
WHICH IS WHAT
WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING.

553
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,793
THE POINT WHERE
THEY COME INTO CONTACT,

554
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,670
COULDN'T THAT
BE DESCRIBED AS...

555
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:25,879
A HOLE?

556
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,256
INDEED.

557
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,259
I POINT OUT THAT A
HOLE IN THE UNIVERSE

558
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,887
OR IN A
SIMPLE CONTAINER

559
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,306
CAN EITHER ALLOW THE
CONTENTS TO ESCAPE...

560
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,267
OR WHAT IS
OUTSIDE TO ENTER.

561
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:43,062
THE INVASION THAT
COMMODORE BARSTOW SUSPECTED.

562
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,064
THERE HAS BEEN
NO EVIDENCE

563
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,442
OF A LARGE-SCALE
INVASION.

564
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:51,279
BUT A SMALL-SCALE
INVASION, MR. SPOCK?

565
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,364
WHAT IS YOUR ANALYSIS

566
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,157
OF THE MENTAL STATE
OF LAZARUS?

567
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,660
DIFFICULT, CAPTAIN.

568
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,787
ONE MOMENT, PARANOID,

569
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,373
THE NEXT,
CALM, MILD, RATIONAL.

570
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:05,669
ALMOST AS IF
HE WERE...TWO MEN.

571
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,253
YES, TWO MEN.

572
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,297
DIFFERENT,
BUT IDENTICAL.

573
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,675
AND A HOLE
IN THE UNIVERSE.

574
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,801
NO, NOT A HOLE.

575
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,011
A DOOR.

576
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,304
THROUGH WHICH

577
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,264
THESE TWO BEINGS

578
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,767
ARE SOMEHOW
ENABLED TO PASS.

579
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,811
TAKE A LOOK AT LAZARUS.

580
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,771
ONE MINUTE HE'S
AT THE POINT OF DEATH,

581
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:28,274
THE NEXT,
HE'S ALIVE, WELL,
STRONG AS A BULL.

582
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,776
THE CUT ON HIS FOREHEAD.

583
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,278
FIRST HE HAS IT,
THEN IT'S GONE,

584
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,822
THEN HE HAS IT AGAIN.

585
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,282
WHICH IS
PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ONE MAN.

586
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,868
QUITE RIGHT.

587
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,328
UNQUESTIONABLY,
THERE ARE TWO OF HIM.

588
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,248
BUT WHAT'S GOING ON?

589
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:47,878

592
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,009
WHAT'S THE PURPOSE?

593
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,845
JIM, MADNESS
HAS NO PURPOSE...

594
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,764
OR REASON...

595
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,767
BUT IT MAY
HAVE A GOAL.

596
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,603
HE MUST BE
STOPPED, HELD...

597
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,563
DESTROYED
IF NECESSARY.

598
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,356
I DON'T FOLLOW YOU.

600
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,987
ONE POSITIVE,

00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,661
THE OTHER, ANTIMATTER.

00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,539
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

605
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,961
MATTER AND ANTIMATTER
HAVE A TENDENCY

606
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,004

EACH OTHER OUT...

607
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,798

610
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,595
WHEN TWO
IDENTICAL PARTICLES

611
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,472
OF MATTER AND
ANTIMATTER MEET...

612
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,225
LIKE LAZARUS...

613
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,853
IDENTICAL...

614
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,690
LIKE BOTH LAZARUS...

615
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,986
ONLY ONE IS MATTER
AND THE OTHER ANTIMATTER.

616
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:56,113
IF THEY MEET...

617
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,907
ANNIHILATION, JIM.

PASSED THROUGH,

ABOUT 10 MINUTES

00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,827
IT KEEPS ETERNITY
FROM BLOWING UP.

700
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,705
THIS CORRIDOR...

701
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,708
IS IT WHAT CAUSED
THE MAGNETIC EFFECT,

702
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,126
THE WINKING-OUT
PHENOMENON?

703
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,712
PRECISELY, CAPTAIN...

704
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,507
BUT NOT BECAUSE
OF ITS EXISTENCE...

705
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,133
BECAUSE...

706
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:17,095
BECAUSE MY FOE ENTERED.

707
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,722
THE CORRIDOR
IS LIKE A PRISON

708
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,141
WITH EXPLOSIVES
AT THE DOOR.

709
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,726
OPEN THE DOOR,

710
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,145
AND THE EXPLOSIVES
MIGHT GO OFF.

711
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,147
STAY INSIDE...

712
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:31,025
AND THE UNIVERSE
IS SAFE.

713
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,112
BOTH UNIVERSES,
CAPTAIN...

714
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,655
YOURS AND MINE.

715
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,078
SURELY, LAZARUS MUST
REALIZE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

716
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,163
IF YOU SHOULD MEET
FACE-TO-FACE

717
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,374
OUTSIDE THE CORRIDOR.

718
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,042
OF COURSE HE
KNOWS, CAPTAIN,

719
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,627
BUT HE'S MAD.

720
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,713
YOU HEARD HIM.
HE'S LOST HIS MIND.

721
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,091
WHEN OUR PEOPLE
FOUND A WAY

722
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,093
TO SLIP
THROUGH THE WARP

723
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,636
AND PROVE
ANOTHER UNIVERSE,

724
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,012
AN IDENTICAL ONE,
EXISTED,

725
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,723
IT WAS TOO
MUCH FOR HIM.

726
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,145
HE COULD NOT LIVE
KNOWING THAT I LIVED.

727
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,729
HE BECAME OBSESSED

728
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,648
WITH THE IDEA
OF DESTROYING ME.

729
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,151
AND THE FACT THAT
IT MEANT HIS OWN
DESTRUCTION

730
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,112
AND EVERYTHING ELSE

731
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,780
MEANT NOTHING TO HIM.

732
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,199
SO YOU'RE
THE TERRIBLE THING,

733
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:23,119
THE MURDERING MONSTER...

734
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,203
THE CREATURE?

735
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,122
YES, CAPTAIN.

736
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,082
OR HE IS.

737
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,418
IT DEPENDS ON
YOUR POINT OF VIEW,

738
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,337
DOESN'T IT?

739
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,342
IT'S READY, CAPTAIN.

740
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,220
IF WE CAN FORCE HIM
INTO THE CORRIDOR
WHILE I'M WAITING,

741
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,181
WE CAN PUT
AN END TO THIS.

742
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,099
BUT IF HE
COMES THROUGH

743
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,685
AT A TIME OF
HIS OWN CHOOSING

744
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,522
AND BREAKS
INTO THIS UNIVERSE
TO FIND ME--

745
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:52,190
I UNDERSTAND.

746
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:55,109
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

747
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,111
FIND HIM.

748
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,532
FORCE HIM THROUGH
HIS THRESHOLD,

749
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,158
WHILE I'M
WAITING FOR HIM,

750
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,452
INTO THE CORRIDOR...

751
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:05,370
AND I'LL
HOLD HIM THERE.

752
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,997
YOU CAN'T
HOLD HIM FOREVER.

753
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,165
CAN'T I, CAPTAIN?

754
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,834
YOU DESTROY HIS SHIP.

755
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,378
BUT IF I DESTROY
HIS SHIP,

756
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,880
WON'T YOURS
ALSO BE DESTROYED?

757
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:16,839
IT WILL.

758
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,258
AND YOUR DOOR
WILL BE CLOSED.

759
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,718
YES, AND SO WILL HIS.

760
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,597
YOU'LL BE TRAPPED INSIDE
THAT CORRIDOR WITH HIM

761
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:25,806
FOREVER...

762
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,851
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS
THROUGHOUT TIME.

763
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,854
IS IT SUCH A
LARGE PRICE TO PAY

764
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,567
FOR THE SAFETY
OF TWO UNIVERSES?

765
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,323
I'M READY.

766
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,076
SEND HIM TO ME.

767
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,953
I'LL BE WAITING.

768
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,976
LAZARUS.

769
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,323
STAND BACK.

770
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:50,975
NO!

771
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,892
NO!

772
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:52,977
NO, I'M NOT READY!

773
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,979
I'M NOT READY!

774
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,773
STOP!

775
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,489
TAKE THESE CRYSTALS
TO THE ENTERPRISE.

776
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:07,492
WE MUST DESTROY
THAT SHIP COMPLETELY.

777
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:09,118
WHAT OF LAZARUS?

778
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,329
AND WHAT OF LAZARUS?

779
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,963
[SIREN WAILS]

780
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,174
ACTIVATE PHASER BANKS.

781
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,134
PHASER BANKS
ACTIVATED.

782
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,970
STAND BY TO FIRE.

783
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:43,235
PHASERS
STANDING BY, SIR.

784
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,494
FIRE PHASERS.

785
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:22,024
ALL RIGHT, MR. LESLEY,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

786
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,025
AHEAD WARP FACTOR ONE.

787
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,319
WARP ONE,
SIR.

788
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,490
EVERYTHING'S ALL
RIGHT, MR. SPOCK...

789
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,658
FOR US.

790
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,243
THERE IS, OF COURSE,

791
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,161
NO ESCAPE
FOR THEM, SIR.

792
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,121
THERE IS, OF COURSE,

793
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,582
NO ESCAPE.

794
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,335
HOW WOULD IT BE...

795
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,088
TRAPPED FOREVER

796
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,716
WITH A RAGING MADMAN
AT YOUR THROAT

797
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,510
UNTIL TIME ITSELF
CAME TO A STOP?

798
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,345
FOR ETERNITY?

799
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,684
HOW WOULD IT BE?

800
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,143
CAPTAIN...

801
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,313
THE UNIVERSE IS SAFE.

802
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,148
FOR YOU AND ME.

803
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:08,905
BUT WHAT OF LAZARUS?
