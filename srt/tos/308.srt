00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,721
[ALARM]

2
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,520
DO WE HAVE MAXIMUM
MAGNIFICATION, LIEUTENANT?

3
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:20,646
YES, SIR.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,111
MISSILE SPREAD,
MR. SPOCK.

5
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,488
VERY ARCHAIC TYPE,
CAPTAIN.

6
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,531
SUBLIGHT SPEED.

7
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,783
AYE, AND CHEMICALLY
FUELED TO BOOT, SIR.

8
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,451
ANYTHING ON COMMUNICATION,
LIEUTENANT UHURA?

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,410
NO, SIR.
ALL BANDS CLEAR.

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,621
COURSE OF THE MISSILE,
MR. SPOCK?

11
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,166
IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
IS THE TARGET, CAPTAIN.

12
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,753
PREPARE PHASER BANKS
ONE AND TWO,
MR. SULU.

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,421
AYE, SIR.

14
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:47,339
MR. CHEKOV, GET A FIX

15
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,174
ON THE MISSILE'S
POINT OF ORIGIN.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,425
AYE, CAPTAIN.

17
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,220
PHASERS ONE AND TWO
LOCKED IN AND READY,
SIR.

18
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,640
FIRE PHASERS.

19
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,314
MR. CHEKOV,
ALTER COURSE

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,316
TO THE MISSILE'S
POINT OF ORIGIN.

21
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,651
AYE, SIR.

22
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,652
WARP FACTOR THREE,
MR. SULU.

23
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,195
WARP FACTOR
THREE, SIR.

24
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,619
I AM
A NURSE FIRST,
DR. McCOY,

25
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,829
AND A MEMBER
OF THE CREW

26
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,247
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>
SECOND.

27
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,249
YOU'RE EXCUSED.
YOU MAY RETURN
TO YOUR QUARTERS.

28
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,584
NO, I'M SORRY,
DOCTOR.

29
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,668
I HAVE CALLED
THE CAPTAIN,

30
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,712
AND I'LL WAIT
UNTIL HE COMES.

31
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,632
WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?

32
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,510
I SAID YOU
WERE EXCUSED, NURSE.

33
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,887
PLEASE, CHRISTINE.

34
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,137
I PROMISE YOU
I'LL GIVE

35
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,224
THE CAPTAIN
A FULL REPORT.

36
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,068
THAT WAS QUITE A SCENE.

37
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,111
I'VE JUST COMPLETED
THE STANDARD
PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS

38
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,780
FOR THE ENTIRE CREW.

39
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,031
EXCELLENT.
WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?

40
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,574
THE CREW IS FIT.

41
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,117
I FOUND
NOTHING UNUSUAL

42
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,994
WITH ONE EXCEPTION.

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:01:59,995
SERIOUS?

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,622
TERMINAL.

45
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:02,414
WHAT IS IT?

46
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,626
XENOPOLYCYTHEMIA.
IT HAS NO CURE.

47
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,754
WHO?

48
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,547
HE HAS ONE YEAR
TO LIVE AT THE MOST.

49
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,466
WHO IS IT?

50
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,593
THE SHIP'S CHIEF
MEDICAL OFFICER.

51
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,012
YOU.

52
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,013
I'LL BE MOST
EFFECTIVE ON THE JOB

53
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,514
IN THE TIME LEFT

54
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,558
IF YOU'LL KEEP THIS
TO YOURSELF.

55
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:37,032
<i>SPACE--</i>
<i>THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

56
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,959
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>

57
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,502
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>

60
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,846

<i>ABOUT DR. McCOY'S CONDITION</i>

<i>AND HAVE REQUESTED</i>
<i>AN IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT.</i>

65
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,570
MR. SPOCK.

66
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,654
YES, CAPTAIN?

67
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,364
CONFIRM
CHEKOV'S COORDINATES

68
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,449
FOR THE MISSILE'S
POINT OF ORIGIN.

69
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,244
CORRECT, CAPTAIN.
WE ARE APPROACHING
THOSE COORDINATES.

70
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,620
AND THAT OBJECT
ON THE SCREEN?

71
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,248
AN ASTEROID.

72
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,126
200 MILES
IN DIAMETER.

73
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,502
COULD THE ENEMY
VESSEL BE HIDING

74
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,962
BEHIND THE ASTEROID?

75
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,130
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.

76
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,384
WE'VE HAD THAT AREA
ON SCANNERS CONSTANTLY.

77
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,013
THEN THE ASTEROID
IS THE MISSILE'S
POINT OF ORIGIN.

78
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,431
CORRECT, CAPTAIN.

79
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,562
FULL SENSOR PROBE,
MR. SPOCK.

80
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,193
TYPICAL ASTEROID
CHEMICALLY,

81
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,153
BUT IT IS NOT ORBITING.

82
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,488
IT IS PURSING
AN INDEPENDENT COURSE

83
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,449
THROUGH THIS SOLAR SYSTEM.

84
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,244
HOW CAN THAT BE?

85
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:50,791
UNLESS IT'S POWERED,
A SPACESHIP.

86
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,667
IT IS UNDER POWER,
CAPTAIN.

87
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,962
AND CORRECTING FOR ALL
GRAVITATIONAL STRESSES.

88
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,588
SOURCE OF POWER.

89
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,298
ATOMIC,
VERY ARCHAIC,

90
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,133
LEAVING A TRAIL
OF DEBRIS

91
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,509
AND HARD RADIATION.

92
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,719
MR. CHEKOV,

93
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,304
PLOT THE COURSE
OF THE ASTEROID VESSEL.

94
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,264
AYE, SIR.

95
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,307
ASTEROID HAS
AN OUTER SHELL,

96
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,810
WHICH IS HOLLOW.

97
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,062
IT SURROUNDS
AN INDEPENDENT
INNER CORE,

98
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,273
WHICH HAS A BREATHABLE
ATMOSPHERE.

99
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,692
SENSORS READ
NO LIFE FORMS.

100
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,237
THEN IT MUST BE
ON AUTOMATIC CONTROLS.

101
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,447
AND THE PASSENGERS

102
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,950
OR BUILDERS ARE DEAD.

103
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,620
COURSE OF ASTEROID--

104
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,122
I MEAN, SPACESHIP--

105
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:34,209
241 MARK 17.

106
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:34,709
INTERESTING.

107
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,211
YES.

108
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,587
THE COURSE ENSIGN CHEKOV

109
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,964
JUST GAVE FOR THE ASTEROID

110
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,924
WOULD PUT IT ON
A COLLISION COURSE

111
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,218
WITH DARAN FIVE.

112
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,848
DARAN FIVE?
INHABITED?

113
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,683
CORRECT.

114
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,894
POPULATION APPROXIMATELY
3,724,000,000

115
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,395
IF MEMORY SERVES
ME CORRECTLY.

116
00:05:54,521 --> 00:06:01,195
ESTIMATED TIME
OF IMPACT 396 DAYS.

117
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,281
MR. SULU,
MATCH<i> ENTERPRISE</i> SPEED

118
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,657
WITH THAT
OF THE ASTEROID VESSEL.

119
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,784
MR. SPOCK AND I
ARE TRANSPORTING ABOARD.

120
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,286
MR. SCOTT,
YOU HAVE THE CON.

121
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,912
AYE, SIR.

122
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,503
A LOT CAN HAPPEN
IN A YEAR.

123
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,299
PLEASE, GIVE YOURSELF
EVERY MINUTE.

124
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,723
DR. McCOY,

125
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,059
MR. SPOCK AND I
WILL HANDLE THIS.

126
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,392
WITHOUT ME, JIM?

127
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,312
YOU'D NEVER FIND
YOUR WAY BACK.

128
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,356
WELL...

129
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,191
I THINK IT WOULD
BE WISER IF--

130
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,775
I'D LIKE TO GO.

131
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,277
I'M FINE,
CAPTAIN.

132
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,697
ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR.

133
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,242
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT.

134
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,933
McCoy: YOU'D SWEAR
YOU'RE ON THE SURFACE
OF A PLANET.

135
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,309
Spock: ONE FAILS
TO SEE THE LOGIC

136
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,811
IN MAKING A SHIP
LOOK LIKE A PLANET.

137
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,147
Kirk: WOULDN'T KNOW
THIS WAS A SPACESHIP.

138
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,481
KIRK TO ENTERPRISE.

139
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,775
ENTERPRISE.
SCOTT HERE.

140
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,152
TRANSPORT WITHOUT INCIDENT.
KIRK OUT.

141
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:52,431
NO APPARENT OPENING.

142
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,350
YOU FOUND NO INTELLIGENT
LIFE FORMS, MR. SPOCK,
BUT SURELY--

143
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,396
THE ASTEROID SHIP<i> IS</i>
OVER 10,000 YEARS OLD
DOCTOR.

144
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,732
STILL NO SIGN
OF LIFE FORMS, CAPTAIN.

145
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,949
THESE ARE WEAPONS.

146
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,368
OF A SORT.

147
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,871
WEAPONS.
COMMUNICATION DEVICES.

148
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,123
LET ME GO
TO MY FRIEND.

149
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,136
YOU ALL RIGHT?

150
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,554
I THINK SO.

151
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,227
I AM NATIRA,

152
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,063
THE HIGH PRIESTESS
OF THE PEOPLE.

153
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,940
WELCOME TO THE WORLD
OF YONADA.

154
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,943
I CAN'T SAY
I THINK MUCH
OF YOUR WELCOME.

155
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,863
TAKE THEM.

156
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,637
YOU WILL KNEEL.

157
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,074
SHE CALLED THIS
THE WORLD.

158
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,201
THESE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THEY'RE ON A SPACESHIP.

159
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,830
THEY'VE BEEN IN FLIGHT
10,000 YEARS.

160
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,624
Maybe they don't
realize it.

161
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,795
OH, ORACLE
OF THE PEOPLE,

162
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,715
MOST PERFECT AND WISE,

163
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,011
STRANGERS HAVE COME
TO OUR WORLD.

164
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,806
THEY BEAR INSTRUMENTS
WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

165
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,905
WHO ARE YOU?

166
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,744
I AM CAPTAIN KIRK

167
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,205
OF THE STARSHIP
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>

168
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,333
THIS IS MY MEDICAL OFFICER,
DR. McCOY.

169
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,669
MY FIRST OFFICER,
MR. SPOCK.

170
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,507
FOR WHAT REASON
DO YOU VISIT THIS WORLD?

171
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,967
WE COME IN FRIENDSHIP.

172
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,302
[THUNDER]

173
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,596
<i>THEN LEARN WHAT IT MEANS</i>
<i>TO BE OUR ENEMY</i>

174
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,723
<i>BEFORE YOU LEARN</i>
<i>WHAT IT MEANS</i>
<i>TO BE OUR FRIEND.</i>

175
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,034
SPOCK?

176
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,623
DR. McCOY.

177
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:32,252
BONES?
BONES.

178
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,836
THE DOCTOR MUST'VE RECEIVED

179
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,296
AN EXCESSIVELY LARGE
ELECTRICAL SHOCK.

180
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,965
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

181
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,719
NOTHING ELSE COULD'VE
CAUSED THIS, CAPTAIN...

182
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,055
AT LEAST NOTHING
THAT HAS HAPPENED HERE.

183
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,057
YOU'RE RIGHT, SPOCK.

184
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,352
THE SHOCK IS SERIOUS
BECAUSE OF McCOY'S
WEAKENED CONDITION.

185
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,729
MAY I ASK...

186
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,523
PRECISELY WHAT IS
TROUBLING THE DOCTOR?

187
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:00,572
I DON'T THINK
HE WOULD'VE
TOLD YOU HIMSELF,

188
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,408
BUT I THINK
YOU SHOULD KNOW NOW.

189
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,535
IT'S XENOPOLYCYTHEMIA.

190
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,330
YES.

191
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,875
I KNOW OF IT, CAPTAIN.

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,586
THEN YOU KNOW
THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE.

193
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,011
MMM.

194
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,513
BONES.

195
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,641
HOW IS IT?

196
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,644
I'M ALL RIGHT.

197
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,480
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
MR. SPOCK?

198
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,064
VERY WELL, DOCTOR.

199
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,900
THE CAPTAIN AND I
SEEM TO HAVE SUFFERED
NO ILL EFFECTS.

200
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,571
OH, THAT ORACLE
REALLY GOT TO ME.

201
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,782
I MUST BE ESPECIALLY
SUSCEPTIBLE

202
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,033
TO ITS MAGIC SPELLS.

203
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,624
SPOCK KNOWS.

204
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,591
WELL, WE BETTER GET
TO THE CONTROL ROOM.

205
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,346
ARE YOU IN ANY CONDITION
TO GET UP?

206
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,723
DON'T WORRY.
I CAN MAKE IT,
JIM.

207
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:12,143
CAPTAIN, INFORMING
THESE PEOPLE
THEY'RE ON A SHIP

208
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,562
MAY BE IN VIOLATION
OF THE PRIME DIRECTIVE

209
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:15,146
OF STARFLEET COMMAND.

210
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,691
NO. THE PEOPLE OF YONADA

211
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,275
MAY BE CHANGED
BY THE KNOWLEDGE,

212
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,861
BUT IT'S BETTER
THAN EXTERMINATING THEM.

213
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,903
LOGICAL, CAPTAIN.

214
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,114
AND THE THREE BILLION
ON DARAN FIVE.

215
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,117
ALSO LOGICAL,
CAPTAIN.

216
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,620
GENTLEMEN, I BELIEVE
WE HAVE A VISITOR.

217
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,183
FOR STRENGTH.

218
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,434
MANY OF US HAVE FELT

219
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,854
THE POWER
OF OUR ORACLE.

220
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,065
THIS HAS BEEN
OF BENEFIT.

221
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,319
TASTES LIKE
AN ANCIENT HERB
DERIVATIVE.

222
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,744
YOU ARE...

223
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:11,952
NOT OF YONADA.

224
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,664
NO, WE'RE FROM
OUTSIDE YOUR WORLD.

225
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,543
WHERE IS OUTSIDE?

226
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,713
UP THERE.

227
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,549
OUTSIDE, UP THERE,
EVERYWHERE.

228
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,346
SO THEY SAY, ALSO.

229
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,230
MANY YEARS AGO...

230
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,649
I CLIMBED THE MOUNTAINS,

231
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,193
EVEN THOUGH
IT IS FORBIDDEN.

232
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,198
WHY IS IT FORBIDDEN?

233
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,619
I AM NOT SURE.

234
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,290
BUT THINGS...

235
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,208
ARE NOT...

236
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,543
AS THEY TEACH US.

237
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,883
FOR THE WORLD
IS HOLLOW,

238
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,762
AND I...HAVE
TOUCHED THE SKY.

239
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,096
AAH!

240
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,186
WHAT IS IT, BONES?

241
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,480
THERE'S SOMETHING
UNDER THE SKIN.

242
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,070
HE'S DEAD.

243
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,324
"FOR THE WORLD
IS HOLLOW,

244
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,535
AND I HAVE TOUCHED
THE SKY."

245
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,162
HE SAID IT WAS FORBIDDEN
TO CLIMB THE MOUNTAINS.

246
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,372
YES, OF COURSE IT IS,

247
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,082
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,
YOU'D TOUCH THE SKY

248
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,376
AND FIND OUT
THAT YOU WERE LIVING
ON A BIG BALL,

249
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,086
NOT A PLANET,
BUT A SPACESHIP.

250
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,547
AND THAT KNOWLEDGE SEEMS
TO BE FORBIDDEN.

251
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,051
WHAT HAPPENED?
WE DON'T KNOW.

252
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,930
HE JUST SUDDENLY SCREAMED
IN PAIN AND DIED.

253
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,557
FETCH THE GUARD.

254
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,270
FORGIVE HIM,

255
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,857
FOR HE WAS
AN OLD MAN,

256
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,609
AND OLD MEN ARE
SOMETIMES FOOLISH.

257
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,277
BUT IT IS WRITTEN

258
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,904
THAT THOSE
OF THE PEOPLE

259
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,699
WHO SIN
OR SPEAK EVIL

260
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,535
SHALL BE PUNISHED.

261
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,337
HE SERVED WELL
FOR MANY YEARS.

262
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,589
TAKE HIM AWAY GENTLY.

263
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,395
YOU DO NOT SEEM WELL.

264
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,104
IT IS DISTRESSING
TO ME.

265
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,482
OH, NO.
I'M QUITE ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

266
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,276
IT IS THE WILL
OF THE ORACLE

267
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,029
THAT YOU NOW
BE TREATED

268
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,614
AS HONORED GUESTS.

269
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,620
YOU SEEM TO BE
THE SPECIAL FAVORITE.

270
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,121
INDEED, DOCTOR.

271
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,041
THE YOUNG LADY<i> DID</i> SHOW
A MARKED PREFERENCE

272
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,250
FOR YOUR COMPANY.

273
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,127
WELL, NOW NOBODY CAN
BLAME HER FOR THAT,
CAN THEY?

274
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,463
PERSONALLY, I FIND
THE LADY'S TASTE
QUESTIONABLE,

275
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,465
BUT SHE OBVIOUSLY
PREFERS YOU,

276
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,761
AND YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T SEEM TO MIND.

277
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,429
IF YOU COULD ARRANGE
TO BE ALONE

278
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,015
WITH THE YOUNG LADY,

279
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,641
SPOCK AND I
WOULD BE LEFT ALONE

280
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,644
TO FIND THE POWER CONTROLS
OF THIS WORLD.

281
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,650
IT IS TIME
TO REFRESH
YOURSELVES.

282
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,698
THANK YOU,
MR. SPOCK.

283
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,622
TO OUR GOOD FRIENDS
OF YONADA.

284
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,919
WE ARE VERY INTERESTED
IN YOUR WORLD.

285
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,879
THAT PLEASES US.

286
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,006
GOOD. THEN YOU
WOULDN'T MIND IF WE
LOOKED AROUND.

287
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,841
NOT AT ALL.
THE PEOPLE KNOW
OF YOU NOW.

288
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,385
[COUGHING]

289
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,805
ARE YOU WELL ENOUGH
TO GO ABOUT?

290
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,016
PERHAPS NOT.

291
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,144
THEN WHY NOT
REMAIN HERE?

292
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,106
REST.
WE WILL TALK.

293
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,608
YOU'RE VERY KIND.

294
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,071
YOU ARE FREE TO GO ABOUT
AND MEET OUR PEOPLE.

295
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,697
THANK YOU.

296
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,617
AND THANK YOU
FOR TAKING CARE
OF DR. McCOY.

297
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,244
NOT AT ALL.

298
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,663
WE SHALL MAKE HIM WELL.

299
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,878
MR. SPOCK.

300
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,386
NO, THANK YOU.

301
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,767
LEAVE US.

302
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,480
I'M CURIOUS.

303
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,026
HOW DID THE ORACLE
PUNISH THE OLD MAN?

304
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,820
I...

305
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,447
CANNOT TELL YOU NOW.

306
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,407
THERE IS SOME WAY
THE ORACLE KNOWS

307
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,536
WHAT YOU SAY,
ISN'T THERE?

308
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,954
WHAT WE SAY.

309
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,622
WHAT WE THINK.

310
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,791
THE ORACLE KNOWS
THE MINDS AND THE HEARTS

311
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,836
OF ALL THE PEOPLE.

312
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:19,093
I DID NOT KNOW
YOU WOULD BE HURT
SO BADLY.

313
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,721
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

314
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,724
I SUPPOSE WE HAD
TO LEARN THE POWER
OF THE ORACLE.

315
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,643
McCOY, THERE IS
SOMETHING I MUST SAY.

316
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,312
SINCE THE MOMENT I...

317
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:44,368
IT IS NOT IN THE MANNER
OF THE PEOPLE TO HIDE
THEIR FEELINGS.

318
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:49,665
OH. HONESTY
IS USUALLY WISE.

319
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,168
IS THERE A WOMAN
FOR YOU?

320
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,343
NO, THERE ISN'T.

321
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,972
DOES McCOY
FIND ME ATTRACTIVE?

322
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,183
OH, YES.

323
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,475
YES, I DO.

324
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:15,108
I HOPE YOU MEN OF SPACE,

325
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,484
OF OTHER WORLDS,

326
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,486
HOLD TRUTH

327
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,280
AS DEAR AS WE DO.

328
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,573
WE DO.

329
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,079
I WISH YOU TO STAY HERE...

330
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,705
ON YONADA...

331
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,208
AS MY MATE.

332
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,519
BUT WE'RE STRANGERS
TO EACH OTHER.

333
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:56,690
BUT IS NOT THAT THE NATURE
OF MEN AND WOMEN...

334
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,986
THAT THE PLEASURE
IS IN THE LEARNING
OF EACH OTHER?

335
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,156
YES.

336
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,576
LET THE THOUGHT REST
IN YOUR HEART, McCOY.

337
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,293
INCREDIBLE
AS IT MAY SEEM,

338
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,254
THESE PEOPLE HAVE
NO IDEA THEY'RE
LIVING ON A SPACESHIP.

339
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,423
I WONDER HOW MANY
GENERATIONS HAVE
LIVED OUT THEIR LIVES

340
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,384
AND BEEN BURIED HERE

341
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,638
WITHOUT EVER KNOWING
THAT THEIR WORLD IS HOLLOW.

342
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:31,058
THE PEOPLE
IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME

343
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,893
WILL REACH A NEW WORLD--

344
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,562
RICH, GREEN,

345
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,856
LOVELY TO THE EYES,

346
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,858
AND OF A GOODNESS

347
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,567
THAT WILL FILL THE HEARTS
OF THE PEOPLE

348
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,195
WITH TEARS OF JOY.

349
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,950
YOU CAN SHARE
THAT WORLD WITH ME,

350
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:52,705
RULE IT BY MY SIDE.

351
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:58,127
HOW LONG WILL IT
TAKE YOU TO REACH
THIS NEW WORLD?

352
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:04,258
SOON. THE ORACLE
WILL ONLY SAY SOON.

353
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,425
OH, IF YOU ONLY KNEW

354
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:09,429
HOW I NEEDED SOME KIND

YES. VERY LONELY.

I NEED TO TELL YOU.

360
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,952
THERE IS NOTHING
YOU NEED TO SAY.

361
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,037
BUT THERE IS.

362

THEN TELL ME...

363
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:39,085
IF THE TELLING
IS SUCH A NEED.

364

365

NO CURE.

00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:12,609
IS IT INDEXED?

704
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,693
YES, IT IS.

705
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,237
HURRY, SPOCK.

706
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,623
IT REFERS TO THE ALTAR.

707
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,545
"APPLY PRESSURE
TO THE CENTER
UNTIL IT OPENS."

708
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:56,486
LET'S GET HER
OUT OF THE HEAT.

709
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,947
I'VE NEUTRALIZED
THE HEATING ELEMENTS.

710
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,618
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT
HERE NOW, JIM.

711
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,961
THE ORACLE CAN
NO LONGER PUNISH US.

712
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,796
YOUR FRIENDS
HAVE PREVENTED IT?

713
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,756
YES.

714
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,176
AND WILL THEY SEND THIS...

715
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,969
THIS SHIP...

716
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,597
AGAIN TO THE LAND
THE CREATORS INTENDED?

717
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,683
YES.

718
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,061
THAT IS GOOD.

719
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,105
ACTIVE AND FUNCTIONAL,

720
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,483
NOT TOO DIFFERENT
FROM THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

721
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:39,862
THERE SEEMS TO BE
A WEAKNESS IN ONE
OF THE 8 TUBES.

722
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,155
ENOUGH TO TURN IT
OFF COURSE?

723
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,198
YES.

724
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,741
LET ME CHECK
THAT ENGINE.

725
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:55,461
VERY SIMPLE PROBLEM,
EASY TO CORRECT.

726
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,841
THEN COME.

727
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,303
NO.

728
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:05,888
DON'T BE AFRAID.

729
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,683
I DO NOT FEAR THE PUNISHMENT
OF DISOBEDIENCE.

730
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,226
WELL, THEN, COME.
WE MUST HURRY
TO JOIN--

731
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:13,104
NO. I CANNOT GO WITH YOU.

732
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:14,689
IT IS NOT FEAR.

733
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:19,527
I UNDERSTAND THE GREAT
PURPOSE OF THE CREATORS.

734
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,195
I SHALL HONOR IT.

735
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:25,991
YOU INTEND TO STAY
HERE, ON YONADA?

736
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:29,912
I SHALL STAY WILLINGLY

737
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:35,209
AND BECAUSE THAT
IS WHAT I MUST DO.

738
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,545
THEN I WON'T
LEAVE YOU.

739
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:44,009
WILL McCOY STAY
HERE TO DIE?

740
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:51,058
NO. McCOY WILL NOT
LET GO OF LIFE
IN THE FULLNESS OF YEARS.

741
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,352
NOW MORE THAN EVER,

742
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,438
I WISH TO SEARCH
THROUGH THE UNIVERSE

743
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:56,648
TO FIND
A CURE FOR MYSELF

744
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:58,691
AND ALL OTHERS
LIKE ME.

745
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,527
AND I WANT YOU
TO BE WITH ME.

746
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:08,993
THIS...
IS MY UNIVERSE.

747
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,080
YOU CAME HERE
WITH A GREAT MISSION--

748
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,832
TO SAVE MY PEOPLE.

749
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,711
SHALL I ABANDON THEM?

750
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:28,137
PERHAPS ONE DAY,
IF IT IS PERMITTED,

751
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,307
YOU WILL FIND
YONADA AGAIN.

752
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:43,528
I BELIEVE WE CAN ATTEMPT
THE COURSE CORRECTION,
CAPTAIN.

753
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,365
GOOD.

754
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,540
GOING BACK
TO MARKED HEADINGS.

755
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,627
GUIDANCE CONTROL'S
TAKING OVER.

756
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:00,503
I BELIEVE
WE CAN ALLOW THIS SHIP

757
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,047
TO GO BACK TO ITS
AUTOMATIC CONTROL.

758
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:06,008
STEADYING ON COURSE
MARKED IN RED.

759
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,889
CAPTAIN.

760
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,684
INTELLIGENCE FILES.

761
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:18,895
THEIR BANKS CONTAIN
THE TOTAL KNOWLEDGE
OF THE FABRINI,

762
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,773
READY FOR THE PEOPLE
TO CONSULT

763
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,484
WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT
THEIR DESTINATION.

764
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,152
AND THEY SEEM
TO HAVE AMASSED

765
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,572
A GREAT DEAL OF
MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE.

766
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:55,683
EXCELLENT, DOCTOR.

767
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,894
THE WHITE CORPUSCLE COUNT
IS BACK TO NORMAL.

768
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,772
OH...

769
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,319
YOUR HEMOGLOBIN COUNT
IS BACK TO NORMAL,
DOCTOR,

770
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,488
WHICH INDICATES
THAT THE FLOW OF OXYGEN

771
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:10,740
TO EACH CELL
OF YOUR BODY

772
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:15,661
IS BACK UP TO ITS
ABUNDANTLY ENERGETIC
LEVEL.

773
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:16,788
THANK YOU, MR. SPOCK,

774
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:19,665
FOR BRINGING BACK
THE KNOWLEDGE OF
THE FABRINI.

775
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,710
DR. McCOY,
THE FABRINI DESCENDANTS

776
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:25,170
ARE SCHEDULED TO DEBARK
ON THEIR PROMISED PLANET

777
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,548
IN APPROXIMATELY 390 DAYS.

778
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:28,466
I THINK THAT
WE COULD MANAGE

779
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:32,720
TO BE IN THAT VICINITY
AT THAT TIME,

780
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:36,599
IF YOU WANTED TO THANK
THE FABRINI PERSONALLY.
