173
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,562
LIEUTENANT,
SHIPWIDE ORDER,

174
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,898
USE COMMUNICATORS
INSTEAD OF INTERCOM.

175
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,192
ISSUE PHASERS
TO ALL CREW MEMBERS.

176
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,444
SPOCK, REPEAT.

177
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,528
<i>I HAVE A READING</i>
<i>FROM LIFE SUPPORT CENTER.</i>

178
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,906
<i>ALIEN SUBSTANCES</i>
<i>BEING INTRODUCED.</i>

179
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,784
MEET ME THERE
ON THE DOUBLE.

180
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,254
SPOCK?

181
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,467
IT IS A FORCE FIELD,
THE NATURE OF WHICH
I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH.

182
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,094
I'M GETTING READINGS
OF AN ALIEN PRESENCE

183
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,554
SIMILAR TO THOSE OBTAINED
ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE,

184
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,556
BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE
NO EXACT LOCATION.

185
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,185
PHASERS ON STUN.
SWEEP THE AREA.

186
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,908
IT WOULD SEEM,
CAPTAIN,

187
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,535
THAT THEY INTEND
TO ALLOW

188
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,912
ONLY THE TWO
OF US TO ENTER.

189
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,789
I SHOULD
ADVISE CAUTION.

190
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,142
WHAT IS IT?

191
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:23,646
UNKNOWN, CAPTAIN.

192
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,859
BUT IT IS
EVIDENTLY A DEVICE
OF ALIEN ORIGIN.

193
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,903
HOOKED INTO
THE LIFE SUPPORT.

194
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,488
DESIGNED TO AFFECT IT?

195
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,448
LIFE SUPPORT IS
STILL OPERATING.

196
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,077
I WOULD SAY THAT
THE INSTALLATION
IS INCOMPLETE.

197
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,579
DISCONNECT IT.

198
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,664
[STATIC]

199
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,376
DESTROY IT.

200
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,968
THAT WAS NO FORCE FIELD.
SOMETHING SHOVED ME BACK.

201
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,470
THEY'RE IN HERE.

202
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,679
YOU!

203
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,474
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY SHIP?

204
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,850
SHOW YOURSELVES!

208
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,574
IT SEEMS THAT
WE MAY LOOK
AT IT, CAPTAIN,

209
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,493
BUT THAT IS ALL.

210
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,453
A SHOW OF STRENGTH.

211
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,455
YES. EVIDENTLY,
THEY'RE CONVINCED

212
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,498
THAT WE CAN DO
NOTHING TO STOP THEM,

213
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,501
AND THEY WISH
TO IMPRESS UPON US

214
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,628
WHAT THEY CAN DO TO US.

215
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,464

BEEN FED INTO THE COMPUTER?

216
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:31,465

00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:20,972

250
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,931
WOULD YOU MIND
EXPLAINING--

00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,731

00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,738
YOU'RE THE ENEMY?

255
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,114
YES.

256
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,908
YOU BEAMED ME ABOARD
YOURSELF WHEN
YOU CAME UP.

257
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,452
A RIDICULOUSLY
LONG PROCESS,

258
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,537
BUT I'VE TAKEN
CARE OF IT.

259
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,748
WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE WITH MY MEN?

260
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,791

261
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,958

THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM.

266
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,265
THEY ARE JUST AS
THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN.

267
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,644

ARE DIFFERENT.

THIS IS NOTHING?

271
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,610
WELL, THEY CANNOT
HEAR YOU, CAPTAIN.

272
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,530
TO THEIR EARS, YOU
SOUND LIKE AN INSECT.

273
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,782
OH, THAT'S YOUR
DESCRIPTION, CAPTAIN.

274
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,202
ACCURATE, IF UNFLATTERING.

275
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,831

00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,753
SO YOU ARE LIKE ME NOW.

279
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,632
YOUR CREW CANNOT
SEE YOU OR ANY OF US

280
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,134
BECAUSE OF THE ACCELERATION.

281
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,847
WE MOVE IN THE
WINK OF AN EYE.

282
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,183
WELL, THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC
EXPLANATION FOR IT,

283
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,228
BUT ALL THAT REALLY
MATTERS IS THAT...

284
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,604
YOU CAN SEE ME

285
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,148
AND TALK TO ME...

286
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,734
AND...

287
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,528
WE CAN GO ON FROM THERE.

288
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,407
WHY?

289
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,075
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

290
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,911
DIDN'T YOU GUESS?

291
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,706
OR ARE YOU SO ACCUSTOMED
TO BEING KISSED

292
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,583
BY INVISIBLE WOMEN?

293
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,586
UH...

294
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,296
UM...

295
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,007
DEELA.

296
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,057
IS THIS WHY
YOU SABOTAGED MY SHIP?

297
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,685
OH, BUT IT HAS NOT
BEEN SABOTAGED.

298
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,145
WE...WE HAD TO MAKE
SOME CHANGES IN IT

299
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,856
TO ADJUST IT TO US.

300
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,733
YOU SAID WE?

301
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,317
YES, OF COURSE.

302
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,487
MY CHIEF SCIENTIST
AND HIS CREW.

303
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,365
I AM THEIR QUEEN.

304
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,244
YOU ARE GOING TO
BE THEIR KING.

305
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,622
YOU'LL ENJOY
LIVING ON SCALOS.

306
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,166
WHAT ABOUT MY SHIP?

307
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,042
MY CREW?

308
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,462
OH, IN A FEW
OF THEIR MOMENTS,

309
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,756
THEY WILL REALIZE
THAT YOU VANISHED.

310
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,340
THEY WILL LOOK FOR YOU,

311
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,676
BUT THEY WILL
NOT FIND YOU.

312
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,054
YOU'RE ACCELERATED FAR
BEYOND THEIR POWER TO SEE.

313
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,515
SO THEY'LL GO ON
WITHOUT YOU.

314
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,975
DON'T BE SO STUBBORN.

315
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,270
YOU CANNOT GO BACK
TO THEM, EVER.

316
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:25,401
IS IT SO DREADFUL
A PROSPECT?

317
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,655
THIS WON'T KILL YOU,

318
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,157
BUT THE STUN EFFECT
IS NOT VERY PLEASANT.

319
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,576
BUT--BUT THAT WON'T WORK.

320
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,580
WELL, YOU GO AHEAD. TRY.

321
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,417
POINT RIGHT AT ME.

322
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,174
MY REACTIONS
ARE MUCH TOO FAST

323
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,593
FOR SUCH A CRUDE WEAPON.

324
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,013
AND I AM QUITE GOOD
AT SELF-DEFENSE, TOO.

325
00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:00,770
THIS CAN BE SET FOR STUN
AND DESTROY, TOO,
LIKE YOURS.

326
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,191
PLEASE...

327
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,776
ACCEPT WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

328
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,612
THERE IS NOTHING
YOU CAN DO TO CHANGE IT.

329
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,334
IF I AGREE
TO GO WITH YOU,

330
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,962
WILL YOU SET THIS
SHIP TO RIGHTS?

331
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,673
TAKE OUT THAT DEVICE IN
THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM?

332
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,216
DON'T BE SO SILLY.

333
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,344
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER ABOUT
IT ALL IN A LITTLE WHILE.

334
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,346
IT ALWAYS HAPPENS
THIS WAY.

335
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,765
THEY ARE VERY
UPSET AT FIRST,

336
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,100
THEN IT WEARS OFF,

337
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,185
AND THEY...

338
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,146
THEY LEARN TO LIKE IT.

339
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,606
YOU WILL, TOO.

340
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,994
HE'S ON HIS WAY TO YOU.

341
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,120
BE GENTLE WITH HIM.

342
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,498
CAPTAIN.
CAPTAIN KIRK!

343
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,333
HE'S GONE!

344
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,211
LIEUTENANT, DID YOU
SEE WHAT HAPPENED?

345
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,213
WELL, HE WAS SITTING THERE.

346
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,381
HE'D JUST DRUNK HIS COFFEE
AND SET THE CUP DOWN.

347
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,759
SEE, IT'S STILL THERE.

348
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,343
AND THEN HE VANISHED.

349
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,262
MR. SULU,
DO YOU VERIFY?

350
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,847
THAT'S JUST THE
WAY IT HAPPENED.

351
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,809
HE WAS THERE, THEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE WASN'T THERE.

352
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,397
CAPTAIN KIRK,
YOU'VE MADE IT.

353
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,358
COMPTON, DID THEY
ACCELERATE YOU?

354
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,860
YES, SIR.

355
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:31,945
THEY'VE HOOKED SOMETHING
INTO THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM.

356
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,153
THEY'RE IN THERE.

357
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:33,905
WE'VE GOT TO GET RID OF IT.

358
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,615
LET'S GO.

359
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,574
I'M SORRY, SIR,
ENTRY IS FORBIDDEN.

360
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,743
BY WHOSE ORDER?

361
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,202
THE COMMANDER SIR.
YOU'LL HAVE TO
STEP BACK, PLEASE.

362
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,621
I'M YOUR COMMANDER, COMPTON.

363
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,039
AND I ORDER YOU
TO LET ME IN.

364
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,874
OH, I'M SORRY,
SIR, YOU ARE
NO LONGER.

365
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,375
WHO IS, DEELA?

366
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,087
IS THAT WHO
YOU'RE WORKING FOR?

367
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,381
AT FIRST
I REFUSED.

368
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,299
BUT THEN AFTER A
WHILE, I FOUND THAT

369
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,593
I COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF.

370
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,596
I MET THIS GIRL.
SHE'S ONE OF THEM.

371
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,181
I'VE NEVER KNOWN
ANYONE LIKE HER.

372
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,268
SHE BROUGHT ME ABOARD
AND I SHOWED THEM THE
OPERATION OF THE SHIP.

373
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,812
BRIDGE CONTROLS,
LIFE SUPPORT.

374
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,481
SHE EXPLAINED THAT
THEY WANTED TO KNOW.

375
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,983
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
AT FIRST.

376
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,901
BUT I DO NOW.

377
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,527
SO WILL YOU, SIR.

378
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,614
ALL RIGHT, COMPTON.

379
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,829
STUN.

380
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,760
YOU WERE ORDERED
TO STOP HIM.

381
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,386
WHY DID YOU DISOBEY?

382
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,554
I TRIED TO STOP HIM.

383
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,475
YOU HURT HIM.

384
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,811
HE WAS VIOLENT.
HE HAD TO BE SUBDUED.

385
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,480
HE WAS MY CAPTAIN.

386
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,901
CELL DAMAGE.

387
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,489
ANOTHER WILL BE
SECURED FOR YOU.

388
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,662
I'M GETTING A TRACE READING

389
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,664
SIMILAR TO THAT
ON THE PLANET.

390
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,707
MR. SULU, DID YOU
DRINK YOUR COFFEE?

391
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:08,708
YES.

392
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,334
DID ANYONE ELSE?

393
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,711
I HAD SOME.

394
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:12,670
MAY I?

395
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,255
WAS IT THE COFFEE?

396
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,341
ARE WE GOING TO GO,
TOO, JUST LIKE
THE CAPTAIN?

397
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,385
I CANNOT GIVE
YOU THAT ANSWER

398
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,137
UNTIL THESE
HAVE BEEN ANALYZED.

399
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,847
WELL, BY THAT
TIME, IT'LL BE
TOO LATE--

400
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,306
I SUGGEST THAT WE RECALL
THE CAPTAIN'S WORDS,

401
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,392
"MAKE THEM TAKE
THE NEXT STEP."

402
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,937
IT WOULD SEEM
THEY HAVE TAKEN IT.

403
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,356
AND WE MUST DETERMINE
EFFECTIVE COUNTERMEASURES.

404
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,358
MR. SCOTT,
YOU HAVE THE CON.

405
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,611
I SHALL BE IN
THE MEDICAL LAB.

406
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,283
I HATE WHAT
HAPPENS TO THEM

407
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,036
WHEN THEY'RE DAMAGED.

408
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:48,414
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO LEARN TO CONTROL
YOUR TEMPER, RAEL.

409
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,001
I DO NOT WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN TO THIS ONE.

410
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,755
IF THEY ARE SO
STUBBORN A SPECIES,

411
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,132
PERHAPS THEY
WILL LAST LONGER.

412
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,508
IT MAY BE.

413
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,761
I HOPE SO.

414
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,429
THEY ALL GO SO SOON.

415
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,599
I WANT TO KEEP THIS
ONE A LONG TIME.

416
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,059
HE'S PRETTY.

417
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,687
HE IS INFERIOR, DEELA.

418
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,563
OH?

419
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,941
I DON'T THINK SO.

420
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,194
YOU CANNOT ALLOW
YOURSELF TO FEEL
AN ATTACHMENT TO SUCH.

421
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:22,322
I CAN ALLOW MYSELF
ANYTHING I WANT.

422
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,451
OH, RAEL, DON'T
BE LIKE THAT.

423
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,745
AM I JEALOUS
OF WHAT YOU DO?

424
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,829
I DO MY DUTY.

425
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,915
SO DO I.

426
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,127
AND SOMETIMES
I ALLOW MYSELF
TO ENJOY IT.

427
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,922
HELLO.

428
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,181
WHAT IS THAT DEVICE
DOING ON MY SHIP?

429
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,269
DEELA WILL EXPLAIN IT.

430
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,399
I WILL TELL YOU ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

431
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,401
AND YOU'LL APPROVE OF IT.

432
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,113
APPROVE OF IT?
WE'RE YOUR PRISONERS.

433
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,699
HARDLY. YOU'RE FREE
TO GO ANYWHERE
YOU WANT TO.

434
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,835
GO AHEAD, CAPTAIN.

435
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,255
IT IS NOT YET
COMPLETELY LINKED TO
YOUR SUPPORT SYSTEM,

436
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,507
BUT IT IS IN
OPERATING ORDER.

437
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,509
STUDY IT
IF YOU WISH.

438
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,762
I SUGGEST THAT
YOU DO NOT TOUCH IT.

439
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,351
[ELECTRICITY]

440
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:47,158
[ELECTRICITY]

441
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,493
HE TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH IT.

442
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,371
LOOK AT YOUR HANDS.
THEY'RE ALMOST FROZEN,
AREN'T THEY?

443
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,041
IT WILL PASS.

444
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,876
THE UNIT HAS ITS OWN
SELF-DEFENSE MECHANISM,

445
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,045
AS YOU SEE.

446
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,587
YOU SHOULD'VE HEEDED ME.

447
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,679
IN YOUR STRUGGLE
WITH COMPTON,

448
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,224
SOME OF HIS CELLS
WERE DAMAGED.

449
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,359
THOSE NEWLY
ACCELERATED
TO OUR LEVEL

450
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,069
ARE SENSITIVE
TO CELL DAMAGE.

451
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,321
THEY AGE VERY
RAPIDLY AND DIE.

452
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,455
HE WAS SO YOUNG.

453
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,665
WAS.

454
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,085
IS THIS WHAT YOU
HAVE PLANNED FOR US?

455
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,669
WE ALL DIE...

456
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,713
EVEN ON SCALOS.

457
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,218
WHY DID YOU
LIE TO HIM?

458
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,511
HE DID NOT
DAMAGE THAT ONE,

459
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,721
YOU DID.

460
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,848
PERHAPS HE WILL
BE LESS VIOLENT NOW.

461
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,849
I SEE NO REASON
TO MAKE HIM

462
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,433
FEEL ANY WORSE
THAN HE HAS TO.

463
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,227
WHY DO YOU CARE
WHAT HE FEELS?

464
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,188
RAEL, HE'S NOT
ONE OF US.

465
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,814
HE'S TEMPORARY.

466
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,192
WHY, HE'S GONE TO
THE MEDICAL LABORATORY.

467
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:06,570
HE'S TRYING TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE VULCAN.

468
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,200
HIS SPECIES IS CAPABLE
OF MUCH AFFECTION.

469
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,119
I HAVE NOTED THAT.

470
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:16,997
I WONDER IF THEY WILL
DEMONSTRATE IT TO US.

471
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,376
OH, RAEL,
STOP SULKING.

472
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,254
ACCEPT IT.

473
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,048
WE'VE HAD TO ACCEPT
IT ALL OUR LIVES.

474
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,759
DON'T MAKE IT WORSE.

475
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,769
GO BACK TO WORK.

476
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,070
KIRK TO SPOCK,

477
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:52,450
I HAVE FED ALL
THE ASCERTAINABLE FACTS

478
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,827
INTO THE COMPUTER BANKS.

479
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:00,333
GO AHEAD.

480
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,960
YOU WON'T
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING,

481
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,212
BUT IT MAY BE
HISTORICALLY VALUABLE.

482
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,301
HYPER-ACCELERATION
IS THE KEY.

483
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,345
I HAVE COUNTED
ONLY FIVE OF
THEM ABOARD,

484
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,097
BUT THEY HAVE
TAKEN OVER THE SHIP,

485
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,476
AND WE ARE UNDER
THEIR CONTROL DUE
TO THIS ACCELERATION.

486
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,314
THEY ARE ABLE
TO SPEED OTHERS
UP TO THEIR LEVEL,

487
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,607
AS THEY DID
COMPTON AND ME.

488
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:29,195
PRESUMABLY, THIS IS...
ENSLAVEMENT?

489
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:33,449
THOSE SO TREATED

490
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:38,037
EXIST AT THIS
ACCELERATED LEVEL,

491
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:42,916
BECOMING DOCILE
EVENTUALLY.

492
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,338
BUT WHEN...

493
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,131
DAMAGED.

494
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,841
DAMAGED...

495
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:55,095
THEY AGE
INCREDIBLY FAST,

496
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,224
AS THOUGH
ACCELERATED LIVING...

497
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,392
BURNS THEM OUT.

498
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,768
BURNS THEM OUT.

499
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,688
COMPTON WAS BURNED OUT.

500
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:09,943
THE DEVICE ATTACHED TO
THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS

501
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,446
PRODUCES AN EXTREME

502
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,947
NUMBING COLD.

503
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:14,948
IT IS MY BELIEF

504
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,575
THAT THEY ARE TURNING
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

505
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,746
INTO A GIGANTIC
DEEP-FREEZE...

506
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:26,793
FOR PURPOSES ONLY
THE SCALOSIANS KNOW.

507
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,712
QUITE CORRECT.

508
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,091
THE UNIT HAS A
PROTECTIVE SHIELD

509
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:35,344
WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW
ANY PHYSICAL CONTACT.

510
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,514
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DESTROY IT,

511
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:42,560
BUT ITS DESTRUCTION
IS IMPERATIVE.

512
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,562
THE UNIT WILL BE ACTIVATED.

513
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,897
BY THE TIME THEY HEAR THIS,

514
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,690
IT WILL BE TOO LATE.

515
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,704
YOU HAVE REMARKABLE
REASONING POWERS, CAPTAIN.

516
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,665
YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT
IN ALMOST EVERY ASSUMPTION.

517
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,334
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

518
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,753
DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW?

519
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,755
IN A LITTLE WHILE, IT
WON'T MATTER TO YOU AT ALL.

520
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,631
YOU'LL BE QUITE
HAPPY ABOUT IT,

521
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,175
JUST AS COMPTON WAS.

522
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,094
I REALLY
WANT TO KNOW.

523
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,221
OH, DEAR.
YOU ARE SO STUBBORN.

524
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:23,100
IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS TO
YOU THAT WE'RE DOING IT
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO.

525
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,143
A LONG TIME AGO--

526
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,020
IT IS IN OUR HISTORY--

527
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,607
WE USED TO BE LIKE YOU.

528
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,025
THEN OUR COUNTRY
WAS ALMOST DESTROYED

529
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,611
BY VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS.

530
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,904
THE WATER WAS POLLUTED.

531
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,697
RADIATION WAS RELEASED.

532
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,325
THAT CHANGED US.

533
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,993
IT ACCELERATED US.

534
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,078
THE CHILDREN DIED.

535
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,582
MOST OF THE WOMEN FOUND
THEY COULD NOT HAVE ANY MORE.

536
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,209
ALL OF OUR MEN
HAD BECOME STERILE.

537
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,463
SO WE HAD TO MATE
OUTSIDE OUR OWN PEOPLE.

538
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,299
WHENEVER A
SPACESHIP CAME BY,

539
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,883
WE'D SEND OUT CALLS FOR HELP.

540
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,178
BUT ACCELERATING
THEM TO OUR LEVEL
BURNED THEM OUT.

541
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,221
DON'T YOU SEE, CAPTAIN?

542
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:04,475
DO I HAVE TO GO
INTO EVERY DETAIL?

543
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:09,313
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE
YOU DOWN WITH US.

544
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,316
PERHAPS ONE OR TWO
OTHERS OF YOUR CREW.

545
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,484
WE HAVE TO.

546
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,819
OH, WE'LL BE KIND TO YOU.

547
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,987
I WOULDN'T HURT
YOU, CERTAINLY.

548
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,281
I DO LIKE YOU.

549
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,742
WHAT ABOUT THE
REST OF MY CREW?

550
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,370
THEY WILL REMAIN HERE
IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION.

551
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:27,831
OH, IT WILL DO
THEM NO HARM.

552
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:32,211
WE ARE SAVING THEM
FOR WHEN WE NEED
THEM IN THE FUTURE.

553
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,254
WELL, YOU WILL
NOT LAST FOREVER.

554
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,089
YOU KNOW THAT, CAPTAIN.

555
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,967
CAPTAIN, WE HAVE
THE RIGHT TO SURVIVE.

556
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,553
NOT BY KILLING OTHERS.

557
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:43,180
WELL, YOU WOULD DO
EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

558
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,558
YOU CAME CHARGING DOWN
INTO THAT LIFE SUPPORT ROOM

559
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,059
THE MINUTE YOU KNEW
THERE WAS TROUBLE.

560
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,687
YOU WOULD'VE KILLED EVERY
ONE OF MY PEOPLE IF YOU
COULD'VE.

561
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,146
YOU INVADED MY SHIP.
YOU THREATENED MY CREW.

562
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,105
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.

563
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,526
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!

564
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,944
YOUR TROUBLE IS IN YOU.

565
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,780
WE DID NOT ASK FOR IT.
WE ARE NOT TO BLAME.

566
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:04,826
WE ARE HANDLING IT IN
THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW HOW--

567
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,496
THE WAY OUR PARENTS DID, AND
THEIR PARENTS BEFORE THEM.

568
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,872
DID THEY
SOLVE ANYTHING?

569
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,625
HAVE YOU TRIED
ANY OTHER WAY?

570
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,254
DEELA, HAVE YOUR
SCIENTISTS DISCONNECT,
DESTROY THAT UNIT.

571
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,755
I PROMISE YOU,

572
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,592
WE'LL USE EVERY SKILL
WE HAVE TO HELP YOU.

573
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,677
WE'LL MOVE YOU
TO ANOTHER PLANET
IT THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

574
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,221
WE'LL CALL ON THE MOST
BRILLIANT MINDS

575
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,681
IN OUR FEDERATION
TO HELP.

576
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:26,848
WE'LL DO--

577
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:27,766
WE HAVE TRIED
OTHER WAYS.

578
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:32,521
WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE
THE TRANSITION
TO YOUR LEVEL.

579
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,565
SOME OF US, THAT IS.

580
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,943
THOSE WHO MADE
THE ATTEMPT DIED.

581
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,570
WE ARE TRAPPED,
CAPTAIN,

582
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,698
JUST AS YOU
ARE TRAPPED NOW.

583
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,910
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU,

584
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,912
BUT I CANNOT CHANGE IT.

585
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,748
YOU CANNOT CHANGE ME.

586
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,750
<i>[BEEPING]</i>

587
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,210
<i>GO TO THE TRANSPORTER</i>
<i>ROOM, DEELA.</i>

588
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,630
<i>SIGNAL ME</i>
<i>WHEN YOU'RE THERE</i>
<i>AND BEAM DOWN.</i>

589
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,757
WITH THE CAPTAIN?

590
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,425
<i>YES.</i>

591
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,969
<i>I'LL ACTIVATE OUR UNIT</i>
<i>AND FOLLOW YOU.</i>

592
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,305
<i>I'M SETTING IT</i>
<i>TO ALLOW ENOUGH</i>
<i>TIME FOR ALL OF US</i>

593
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,181
<i>TO GET OFF THE SHIP.</i>

594
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,183
<i>PLEASE DON'T DELAY.</i>

595
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,812
JUST WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK I WOULD DO
THAT?

596
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,272
THE CAPTAIN'S GONE.

597
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,650
WELL, GO AFTER HIM, DEELA.

598
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,487
THERE'S NO QUESTION
ABOUT IT, SPOCK.

599
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,947
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS.

600
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,325
THE SAME SUBSTANCE
IS IN THE CAPTAIN'S
COFFEE

601
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,118
AS IN THE
SCALOSIAN WATER,

602
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:28,744
AND THERE'S NO TRACE OF
IT ANY OF THE OTHER CUPS.

603
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,579
HMM.

604
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,923
WHY DID YOU RUN?

605
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,383
I PANICKED.

606
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:44,760
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

607
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,094
I'D LIKE TO LEAVE
BEFORE HE ACTIVATES

608
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,387
THE SUSPENDED
ANIMATION DEVICE.

609
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,139
WE'RE IN THE
TRANSPORTER ROOM.

610
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,224
YOU CAN ACTIVATE.

611
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,477
<i>BEAM HIM DOWN AT ONCE.</i>

612
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,608
CAPTAIN?

613
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,379
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO
THE TRANSPORTER, CAPTAIN?

614
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,755
IT WAS WORKING BEFORE.

615
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,132
TRY IT AGAIN.

616
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,638
THE TRANSPORTER
ISN'T WORKING.

617
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,306
WHAT'D HE DO TO IT?

618
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,767
NOTHING, HE
DIDN'T HAVE TIME.

619
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,645
IT MUST BE A--
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT--

620
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,479
A MALFUNCTION.

621
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:41,024
YOU'D BETTER NOT
ACTIVATE THE UNIT YET.

622
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,822
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IT IS, CAPTAIN?

623
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,032
THE TECHNICIANS REPORTED
A LOSS OF POWER.

624
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,492
THAT MUST BE IT.

625
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,828
THE CAPTAIN SAYS
HIS TECHNICIANS--

626
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,371
<i>I HEARD HIM.</i>

627
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,498
<i>YOU EXPECT ME</i>
<i>TO BELIEVE HIM?</i>

628
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,585
I EXPECT YOU TO CHECK
INTO ALL POSSIBLE CAUSES.

629
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,048
IF I HAD A SUSPICIOUS
NATURE, CAPTAIN,

630
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,634
I WOULD SAY
THAT YOU SABOTAGED
THE TRANSPORTER

631
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,261
TO BUY TIME.

632
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,012
YES, OF COURSE.

633
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,766
I'M GLAD
WE'RE BOTH INNOCENT.

634
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:17,143
I DESPISE DEVIOUS
PEOPLE, DON'T YOU?

635
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,146
OH, I BELIEVE IN HONEST
RELATIONSHIPS MYSELF.

636
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,816
NURSE, PROGRAM
THE INFORMATION

637
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,611
AND DETERMINE
WHETHER WE CAN
FIND COUNTERAGENTS.

638
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,321
[BUZZING]

639
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,948
DOCTOR,

640
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,408
DID YOU JUST--

641
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,451
I'VE BEEN HEARING
THAT WHINE

642
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,746
EVER SINCE WE BEAMED
DOWN TO SCALOS.

643
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,956
MM-HMM.

644
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,083
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

645
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,669
WE BROUGHT IT
WITH US FROM SCALOS.

646
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,212
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE
ME, DOCTOR,

647
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,381
I SHALL BE
ON THE BRIDGE.

648
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,426
YOUR QUARTERS ARE QUITE
LIKE YOU, CAPTAIN--

649
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,178
AUSTERE AND EFFICIENT...

650
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,849
AND IN THEIR OWN
WAY, HANDSOME.

651
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,477
A ROOM SHOULD
REFLECT ITS OCCUPANT.

652
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,228
ABSOLUTELY.

653
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,022
MAY I FRESHEN UP?

654
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,693
ALL THIS RUSHING ABOUT
HAS LEFT ME WINDBLOWN.

655
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:10,238
I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT
YOU ALLOW YOURSELF
SOME COMFORTS.

656
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,741
ARE YOU MARRIED, CAPTAIN?

657
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,245
NO FAMILY?
NO ATTACHMENTS?

658
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,456
I KNOW--YOU'RE
MARRIED TO YOUR CAREER,

659
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,375
AND YOU NEVER LOOK
AT ANOTHER WOMAN.

660
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:26,045
WELL, IF SHE'S
PRETTY ENOUGH,

661
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,255
I'LL LOOK.

662
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,677
I WONDERED WHEN YOU'D
SAY SOMETHING NICE TO ME.

663
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,638
AM I MORE
PRESENTABLE NOW?

664
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,225
A BIT.

665
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,188
IT WAS QUITE DELIGHTFUL
KISSING YOU

666
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,983
WHEN YOU COULDN'T SEE ME.

667
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,068
BUT NOW...

668
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,570
BUT NOW...

669
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,500
OH.

670
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,626
NO.

671
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,713
I WOULDN'T ALLOW
YOU TO TAKE THAT,

672
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:11,049
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
WE TRUST EACH OTHER.

673
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,551
BUT I WOULD'VE BEEN
DISAPPOINTED

674
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,469
IF YOU HADN'T TRIED.

675
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,515
WAS I...TOO CRUDE?

676
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,727
JUST DON'T TRY IT AGAIN.

677
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:24,646
YOU'RE FAR TOO
VULNERABLE TO
SKIN DAMAGE.

678
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,316
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS SCRATCH YOU.

679
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,609
YES, I KNOW.

680
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,487
THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US

681
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,489
IS THAT YOU WILL
COME AROUND

682
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,409
TO OUR WAY OF THINKING
SOONER OR LATER.

683
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:41,204
BUT IT'S BETTER
SOONER THAN LATER.

684
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,550
LIEUTENANT,
WILL YOU REPLAY

685
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,011
THE SCALOSIAN
DISTRESS CALL
ON MY VIEWER?

686
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,721
AYE, SIR.

<i>SPACE TRAVELERS</i>

689
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,979
<i>I SEND YOU AN URGENT</i>

<i>COMPTON!</i>

693
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,659
<i>WHAT HAPPENED?</i>

694
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,327
<i>I WAS LOOKING AT HIM.</i>

695
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,122
<i>I WAS LOOKING</i>
<i>RIGHT AT HIM,</i>

696
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,750
<i>AND THEN HE JUST</i>
<i>WASN'T THERE!</i>

697
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,295
<i>THOSE OF US</i>
<i>WHO ARE LEFT</i>

698
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,380

00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,299
I CAN THINK OF
NOTHING I'D...

873
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,301
RATHER DO...

874
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:44,594
THAN STAY WITH YOU.

875
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,930
EXCEPT STAYING ALIVE.

876
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,734
ENERGIZE.

877
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,236
GOODBYE, CAPTAIN.

879
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,249
WELL, MR. SPOCK,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

880
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,670
DR. McCOY AND I
HAVE SYNTHESIZED
A POSSIBLE COUNTERAGENT

881
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:20,421
TO THE SCALOSIAN WATER.

882
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,924
REGRETTABLY, WE DID NOT
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO TEST IT.

883
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,927
LET'S TEST IT.

884
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,693
NOTHING'S HAPPENING.

885
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,909
YOU DO SEEM TO BE MOVING
VERY SLOWLY, CAPTAIN.

886
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:56,081
[SLOWED-DOWN VOICE]
MISTER...

887
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:00,753
SPOCK.

888
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:04,841
CAPTAIN KIRK,
WHERE THE BLAZES
DID YOU COME FROM?

889
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,218
OUT OF THE NOWHERE,
INTO THE HERE.

890
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,261
AND MR. SPOCK,
IS HE COMING, TOO?

891
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,471
SCOTTY.

<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 5710.9.</i>

893
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,060
<i>MR. SPOCK HAS REMAINED</i>
<i>IN ACCELERATED TIME</i>

894
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:19,772
<i>SO THAT HE MIGHT</i>

895
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,233

SOMEBODY'S REPAIRING
EVERY CONSOLE ON THE SHIP.

896
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,984
[SCOTTY]
THIS PANEL IS
BEING RECIRCUITED

897
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,486
AT INCREDIBLE SPEED.

898
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:29,824
I THINK WE'VE
LOCATED MR. SPOCK.

899
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,159
LIEUTENANT, ARE YOUR
CIRCUITS CLEARING?

900
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,369
YES, SIR.

901
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:34,871
CANCEL RED ALERT,
MR. SULU.

902
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,748
AYE, SIR.

903
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:38,999
OPEN ALL CHANNELS.

904
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,085
CAPTAIN TO CREW,

905
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,046
REPAIRS ARE NOW BEING
EFFECTED BY MR. SPOCK.

906
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,091
THE SHIP WILL RESUME
NORMAL OPERATIONS
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.

907
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:53,180
MR. SPOCK, MY COMPLIMENTS
TO YOUR REPAIR WORK
AND YOURSELF.

908
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,766
THANK YOU,
CAPTAIN.

909
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:57,810
I FOUND IT
AN ACCELERATING
EXPERIENCE.

910
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,562
YES.

911
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,482
NO MALFUNCTIONS
ANYWHERE?

912
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,071
LIEUTENANT.

913
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,947
OH, I'M SORRY, SIR.

914
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,033
I TOUCHED THE TAPE
BUTTON ACCIDENTALLY.

915
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,911
I'LL TAKE IT OFF.

916
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,078
THAT'S...

917
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,372
NO MALFUNCTION?

918
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,583
NO, SIR.

919
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:34,639
GOODBYE, DEELA.
