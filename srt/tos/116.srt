00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,796
UNDER
PRESENT CONDITIONS,
EXTREMELY POOR.

174
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,631
BUT THEY'LL BE
LOOKING FOR US.

175
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,469
IF THE IONIZATION EFFECT
IS AS WIDESPREAD AS I
BELIEVE IT IS, DOCTOR,

176
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,680
THEY'LL BE SEARCHING FOR US
WITHOUT INSTRUMENTATION,

177
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,682
BY VISUAL CONTACT ONLY.

178
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,267
ON THOSE TERMS,

179
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,977
THIS IS
A VERY LARGE PLANET.

180
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,396
THEN YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'LL FIND US.

181
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,689
NOT AS LONG AS
WE'RE GROUNDED.

182
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,567
WE MAY BE HERE FOR A
VERY LONG TIME, DOCTOR.

183
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,117
NOTHING, CAPTAIN.

184
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,538
MR. SULU?
YES, CAPTAIN?

185
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,081
ANYTHING ON YOUR SCANNERS?

186
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,623
TOTALLY INOPERATIVE,
SIR. NO READINGS
AT ALL.

187
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,834
HAVE YOU TRIED TYING INTO
THE AUXILLARY POWER?

188
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,586
YES, SIR. NO CHANGE.

189
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,298
TRANSPORT ROOM...

190
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,426
THIS IS
THE CAPTAIN SPEAKING.

191
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,635
ARE THE TRANSPORTERS
BEAMING UP YET?

192
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,012
Man: NOT 100%, CAPTAIN.

193
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,680
WE BEAMED DOWN
SOME INNERT MATERIAL,

194
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,225
BUT IT CAME BACK IN A
DISSOCIATED CONDITION.

195
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,477
WE WOULDN'T DARE TRY IT
WITH PEOPLE.

196
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,729
THANK YOU.

197
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,441
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN SPEAKING.

198
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:12,112
FLIGHT DECK,
PREPARE<i> COLUMBUS</i>
FOR IMMEDIATE EXIT...

199
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,281
FOR A SEARCH
OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE.

200
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,366
CORRELATE COORDINATES
FOR MR. SULU.

201
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,410
THANK YOU.

202
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,037
ANYTHING, UHURA?

203
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,583
ALL WAVELENGTHS DOMINATED
BY IONIZATION EFFECTS, SIR.

204
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,669
TRANSMISSION IS BLOCKED,
RECEPTION IMPOSSIBLE.

205
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,047
WELL, CAPTAIN.

206
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,551
WE HAVE UNTIL 2823.8

207
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,512
TO CONTINUE THE SEARCH,
COMMISSIONER.

208
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,600
YOU DON'T REALLY
THINK YOU'LL HAVE
ANY LUCK, DO YOU?

209
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,185
LOOK, THESE PEOPLE
ARE MY FRIENDS
AND MY SHIPMATES.

210
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,313
I INTEND TO CONTINUE
THE SHIP'S SEARCH FOR THEM

211
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,148
UNTIL THE LAST
POSSIBLE MOMENT.

212
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,275
VERY WELL, CAPTAIN.

213
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,110
BUT NOT ONE SECOND
BEYOND THAT MOMENT.

214
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,028
IS THAT CLEAR?

215
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,030
IF IT ISN'T,
I SUGGEST

216
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,408
YOU LOOK AT BOOK 19,
SECTION 433,
PARAGRAPH 12--

217
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,368
I AM FAMILIAR
WITH THE REGULATIONS,
COMMISSIONER.

218
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,954
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
YOUR AUTHORITY.

219
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,874
LAUNCH
SHUTTLECRAFT<i> COLUMBUS.</i>

220
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,391
WELL, I CAN'T SAY MUCH
FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

221
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,393
BUT AT LEAST IT'S
YOUR BIG CHANCE.

222
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,396
MY BIG CHANCE?
FOR WHAT, DOCTOR?

223
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,358
COMMAND.

224
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,401
OH, I KNOW YOU,
MR. SPOCK.

225
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,819
YOU'VE NEVER
VOICED IT,

226
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,446
BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS
THOUGHT THAT LOGIC

227
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,906
WAS THE BEST
BASIS ON WHICH
TO BUILD COMMAND.

228
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,074
AM I RIGHT?

229
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,784
I AM A LOGICAL MAN,
DOCTOR.

230
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,787
IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN LOGIC
TO GET US OUT OF THIS.

231
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,957
PERHAPS, DOCTOR, BUT I KNOW
OF NO BETTER WAY TO BEGIN.

232
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,959
I REALIZE THAT COMMAND
DOES HAVE ITS FASCINATIONS,

233
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,546
EVEN UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES
SUCH AS THESE,

234
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,964
BUT I NEITHER ENJOY
THE IDEA OF COMMAND,

235
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,008
NOR AM I
FRIGHTENED OF IT.

236
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,718
IT SIMPLY EXISTS.

237
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,930
AND I WILL DO WHATEVER
LOGICALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE.

238
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,016
EXCUSE ME.

239
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,116
VERY BAD, MR. SPOCK.

240
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,117
IN WHAT WAY?

241
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,037
WE'VE LOST A GREAT
DEAL OF FUEL.

242
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,873
WE HAVE NO CHANCE AT ALL
TO REACH ESCAPE VELOCITY.

243
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,376
AND IF WE EVER
HOPE TO MAKE ORBIT,

244
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,879
WE'LL HAVE TO LIGHTEN OUR LOAD
BY AT LEAST 500 POUNDS.

245
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,507
THE WEIGHT
OF THREE GROWN MEN.

246
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,967
AYE, YOU COULD
PUT IT THAT WAY.

247
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,969
OR THE EQUIVALENT
WEIGHT IN EQUIPMENT.

248
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,597
DR. McCOY, WITH
VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS,

249
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,015
WE USE VIRTUALLY
EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT

250
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,601
ABOARD THIS CRAFT
IN ATTAINING ORBIT.

251
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,937
THERE'S VERY LITTLE
EXCESS WEIGHT, EXCEPT
AMONG THE PASSENGERS.

252
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,689
YOU MEAN THREE OF US
MUST STAY BEHIND.

253
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,400
UNLESS THE SITUATION
CHANGES RADICALLY, YES.

254
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,277
AND WHO'S TO CHOOSE?

255
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,530
AS COMMANDING OFFICER,

256
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,532
THE CHOICE WILL BE MINE.

257
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,783
YOU WOULDN'T
BE INTERESTED
IN DRAWING LOTS?

258
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,494
VERY QUAINT IDEA,
MR. BOMA,

259
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,289
BUT I DO BELIEVE
I'M BETTER QUALIFIED
TO MAKE THE SELECTION

260
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,499
THAN ANY RANDOM
DRAWING OF LOTS.

261
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,667
ALL RIGHT, MR. SPOCK.

262
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,210
WHO?

263
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,256
MY CHOICE WILL
BE A LOGICAL ONE,

264
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,716
ARRIVED AT THROUGH
LOGICAL MEANS.

265
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,637
MR. SPOCK, LIFE AND DEATH
ARE SELDOM LOGICAL.

266
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,264
BUT ATTAINING A DESIRED
GOAL ALWAYS IS, DOCTOR.

267
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,891
NOW, GENTLEMEN, I SUGGEST
WE MOVE OUTSIDE

268
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,310
TO MAKE A FURTHER
EXAMINATION OF THE HULL

269
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,146
IN THE EVENT WE'VE
OVERLOOKED ANY MINOR DAMAGE.

270
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,566
IF ANY MINOR DAMAGE
WAS OVERLOOKED

271
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,694
IT WAS WHEN
THEY PUT HIS HEAD
TOGETHER.

272
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:43,615
NOT HIS HEAD, MR. BOMA.
HIS HEART.

273
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,075
HIS HEART.

274
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,957
[THRUMMING]

275
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,048
WHAT IS IT?

276
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,093
I--I DON'T KNOW.

277
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,012
IT'S FROM UP THERE.

278
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,395
NO, NO,
IT'S FROM BACK THERE.

279
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,696
IT'S EVERYWHERE.
IT'S ALL AROUND US!

280
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,281
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

AAH!

283
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,151
COME ON, BOMA.

[ROAR]

286
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,014
WHAT WAS IT?

287
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,602
IT WAS SOMETHING HUGE,
TERRIBLE.

288
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,020
U-UP THERE.
I THINK I HIT IT.

289
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,819
DID YOU SEE
WHAT IT WAS?

290
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,447
VAGUELY. IT WAS
LIKE A GIANT APE.

291
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:50,074
POOR LATIMER.

292
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,327
AT LEAST IT WAS
QUICK FOR HIM.

293
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,996
WE'LL GET OFF ALL RIGHT.

294
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,543
NOTHING THERE.

295
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,210
I TELL YOU,
THERE WAS.

296
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,212
I DON'T DOUBT
YOUR WORD.

297
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,631
WELL, THERE MUST
BE SOMETHING.

298
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,674
I SWEAR I HIT IT.

A BIT MORE CRUDE
ABOUT THE SHAFT,

NOT VERY EFFICIENT?

00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,193
IS THAT ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY?

308
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,278
AM I IN ERROR,
MR. BOMA?

309
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:32,158
YOU, ERROR?
IMPOSSIBLE.

310
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,534
THEN WHAT, MR. BOMA?

311
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,078
THERE'S A MAN
LYING THERE DEAD.

312
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,164
AND YOU TALK ABOUT

IN THE INTEREST
OF EFFICIENCY,

00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,094
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
LEAVE HIS BODY HERE.

319
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,014
BRINGING HIM BACK
TO THE SHIP SHOULD
NOT INTERFER

345
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,627
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

346
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,128
TRY USING OVERLOAD POWER
ON THE TRANSPORTERS.

347
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,422
WE'VE GOT TO GET THEM
WORKING.

348
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,840
<i>AYE AYE, CAPTAIN.</i>

349
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,550
UHURA.

350
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,761
ORDER THE<i> COLUMBUS</i>
TO OPEN ITS COURSE

351
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:19,057
2 DEGREES ON EVERY
LAP FROM NOW ON.

352
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,349
CAPTAIN, 2 DEGREES

353
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,810
MEANS THEY'LL BE
OVERLOOKING

354
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,938
MORE THAN A DOZEN
TERRESTRIAL MILES
ON EACH SEARCH LOOP.

355
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,105
IT ALSO MEANS WE HAVE
A FIGHTING CHANCE

356
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,399
TO COVER THE MAJORITY
OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE.

357
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,610
MIND YOUR HELM,
MR. SULU.

358
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,653
YES, SIR.

359
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,452
24 MORE HOURS, CAPTAIN.

360
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,462
PERHAPS IF YOU
WERE TO CHANNEL THE
SECOND AUXILLARY TANK

361
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,047
THROUGH THE PRIMARY
INTAKE VALVE.

362
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,007
IT'S TOO DELICATE.

363
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,676
IT MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO TAKE THE PRESSURE
AS IT IS.

364
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,430
THIS SHOULD SAVE US
AT LEAST 50 POUNDS,
MR. SPOCK.

365
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,181
EXCELLENT,
DOCTOR.

366
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,225
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
SCRAPE UP ANOTHER 100 POUNDS.

367
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,353
WHICH WOULD STILL
LEAVE US AT LEAST
150 POUNDS OVERWEIGHT.

368
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,481
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE SERIOUS

369
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,356
ABOUT LEAVING
SOMEONE BEHIND.

370
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,942
NOW, WHATEVER
IT IS OUT THERE--

371
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,403
IT IS MORE RATIONAL
TO SACRIFICE ONE LIFE
THAN SIX, DOCTOR.

372
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,990
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT RATIONALITY.

373
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,866
YOU MIGHT BE
WISE TO START.

374
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,287
MR. SPOCK.
WE'RE READY.

375
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,246
FOR WHAT?

376
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,165
THE SERVICES
FOR LATIMER.

377
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,710
MR. BOMA,
WE'RE WORKING
AGAINST TIME.

378
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,420
THE MAN'S DEAD.
HE DESERVES A DECENT BURIAL.

379
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,840
YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN.
A FEW WORDS.

380
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,883
DOCTOR, PERHAPS YOU
KNOW THE CORRECT WORDS
FOR SUCH AN OCCASION.

381
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,012
MR. SPOCK,
THAT'S YOUR PLACE.

382
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,596
MY PLACE IS HERE.

383
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,931
IF YOU PLEASE,
DOCTOR.

384
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,641
NOW, LOOK,
WE MAY ALL DIE HERE.

385
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,727
AT LEAST LET US DIE
LIKE MEN, NOT MACHINES.

386
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,395
BY DEALING WITH
FIRST THINGS FIRST,

387
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,107
I HOPE TO INCREASE
OUR CHANCES
OF STAYING ALIVE.

388
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,153
WELL, MR. SCOTT.

389
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,572
IF YOU'LL GIVE ME A HAND
WITH THIS CONDUIT.

390
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,124
THE PRESSURE'S DROPPING.

391
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,750
WE'RE LOSING EVERYTHING.

392
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:10,751
WHAT HAPPENED?

393
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,336
ONE OF THE LINES GAVE.

394
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,963
THE STRAIN OF COMING
THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE

395
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:18,300
AND THE ADDED LOAD
WHEN WE TRIED TO BYPASS.

396
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,261
YEAH, THAT'S DONE IT.

397
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,390
WE HAVE NO FUEL.

398
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:28,978
WELL, THAT WOULD SEEM
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
OF WHO TO LEAVE BEHIND.

399
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,437
CONSIDER THE ALTERNATIVES,
MR. SCOTT.

400
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,315
WE HAVE NO FUEL!
WHAT ALTERNATIVES?

401
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,860
MR. SCOTT, THERE ARE
ALWAYS ALTERNATIVES.

402
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,571
MR. SPOCK!

403
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,614
SOMETHING'S
HAPPENING OUTSIDE.

404
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,040
[THRUMMING]

405
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,504
WHAT DO THOSE
SUPERSENSITIVE EARS
MAKE OF THAT, MR. SPOCK?

406
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,758
WOOD--RUBBING ON
SOME KIND OF LEATHER.

407
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,385
THEY'RE GETTING READY.
THEY'LL ATTACK.

408
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,344
NOT NECESSARILY.

409
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,722
IT COULD BE A SIMPLE
TRIBAL RITE,

410
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,390
ASSUMING
A TRIBAL CULTURE.

411
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,433
NOT A TRIBAL CULTURE.

412
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,351
THEIR ARTIFACTS
ARE TOO PRIMITIVE.

413
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,311
MORE LIKELY A LOOSE
ASSOCIATION OF SOME SORT.

414
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,730
IF WE KNEW MORE
ABOUT THEM.

415
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:13,773
WE KNOW ENOUGH.

416
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:17,068
IF THEY'RE TRIBAL,
THEY'LL HAVE
A SENSE OF UNITY.

417
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,402
WE CAN USE THAT.

418
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,653
HOW, MR. BOMA?

419
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,031
BY HITTING THEM HARD.
GIVE THEM A BLOODY NOSE,

420
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,366
MAKE THEM THINK TWICE
ABOUT ATTACKING US.

421
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,325
YES. I AGREE.

422
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,827
IF WE STAND BY
AND DO NOTHING,

423
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,204
WE'RE JUST GIVING THEM
AN INVITATION

424
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,371
TO COME DOWN
AND SLAUGHTER US.

425
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,457
HMM. I'M FREQUENTLY APPALLED

426
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,667
BY THE LOW REGARD
YOU EARTHMEN HAVE FOR LIFE.

427
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,294
WELL, WE'RE
PRACTICAL ABOUT IT.

428
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,588
NOW, I SAY WE HIT THEM
BEFORE THEY HIT US.

429
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,050
MR. BOMA?

430
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,969
ABSOLUTELY.

431
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,553
DR. McCOY?

432
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,555
SEEMS LOGICAL TO ME.

433
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,349
IT DOES INDEED.

434
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,518
IT SEEMS LOGICAL
TO ME ALSO.

435
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,771
BUT TO TAKE LIFE
INDISCRIMINATELY...

436
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:54,855
THE MAJORITY.

437
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:55,773
I'M NOT INTERESTED

438
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,025
IN THE OPINION OF
THE MAJORITY, MR. GAETANO.

439
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,195
COMPONENTS MUST BE WEIGHED--
OUR DANGERS TO OURSELVES

440
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,655
AS WELL AS OUR DUTIES
TO OTHER LIFE FORMS,

441
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,241
FRIENDLY OR NOT.

442
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,289
THERE'S A THIRD COURSE.

443
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,873
THAT COULD
GET US KILLED.

444
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:13,874
I THINK NOT!

445
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,709
DR. McCOY,
YOU AND YEOMAN MEARS

446
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,418
RETURN TO THE SHIP.

447
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,171
ASSIST MR. SCOTT
IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.

448
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,713
RIGHT.
WE'LL BE BACK SHORTLY.

449
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,506
GENTLEMEN,

450
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:24,093
YOU'LL FOLLOW MY ORDERS
TO THE LETTER,

451
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,970
FIRING ONLY
WHEN SO INSTRUCTED,

452
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,429
AND AT MY DESIGNATED
TARGETS.

453
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,597
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

454
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,474
YOU'LL FIRE TO FRIGHTEN,
MR. GAETANO,

455
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,600
NOT TO KILL.

456
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,854
[THRUMMING]

457
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,189
OH, FOR THE...

458
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,315
YOU SAW WHAT THEY
DID TO LATIMER.

459
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,357
I AM IN COMMMAND,
MR. GAETANO.

460
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,069
THE ORDERS AND
THE RESPONSIBILITY
WILL BE MINE.

461
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,570
FOLLOW ME.

462
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,528
[RRRAARR]

463
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:48,094
[RRRARR]

464
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,553
THE MISTS, I...

465
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,306
I CAN'T SEE THEM.

466
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,974
I HEAR THEM.

467
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,352
THEY'RE DIRECTLY
AHEAD OF US.

468
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,854
SEVERAL, I BELIEVE.

469
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,858
DIRECT YOUR PHASERS
TO 2 O'CLOCK AND TO 10 O'CLOCK.

470
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,402
I SAY WE HIT THEM
DEAD ON.

471
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,280
YES, I KNOW, BUT FORTUNATELY,
I'M GIVING THE ORDERS.

472
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:08,906
TAKE AIM, PLEASE,

473
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,117
AND FIRE WHEN
I GIVE A SIGNAL.

474
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,920
FIRE.

475
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,719
CEASE FIRE.

476
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,729
THEY SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE
BOTHERING US AGAIN.

477
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,064
I STILL SAY WE SHOULD
HAVE KILLED THEM.

478
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,941
IT WAS NOT NECESSARY.

479
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,068
FEAR WILL DO FOR US
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

480
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,570
MR. BOMA, YOU WILL RETURN
WITH ME TO THE<i> GALILEO.</i>

481
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,364
MR. GAETANO,
YOU REMAIN ON GUARD HERE.

482
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,574
KEEP IN CONTACT
WITH THE SHIP.

483
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,762
DID YOU FIND THEM?

484
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,056
YES, WE FOUND THEM.
THEY WON'T
BOTHER US AGAIN.

485
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,809
I HOPE NOT.

486
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,269
SCOTTY HAS AN IDEA.

487
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,439
IT'S DANGEROUS,
BUT IT MIGHT WORK.

488
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,609
GO, MR. SCOTT.

489
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,611
I CAN ADJUST
THE MAIN REACTOR

490
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,115
TO FUNCTION WITH
A SUBSTITUTE
FUEL SUPPLY.

491
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,201
THAT'S ALL VERY WELL,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
A SUBSTITUTE SUPPLY.

492
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,703
AYE, WE DO.
OUR PHASERS.

493
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,497
I CAN ADAPT THEM AND
USE THEIR ENERGY.

494
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,082
IT'LL TAKE TIME,
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE.

495
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,418
THE TROUBLE IS THEY HAPPEN
TO BE OUR ONLY DEFENSE.

496
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,379
THEY ALSO SEEM TO BE
OUR ONLY HOPE.

497
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:47,838
AYE.

498
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,887
YEOMAN,

499
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,472
YOUR PHASER.

500
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,349
BUT WHAT IF
THE CREATURES
ATTACK AGAIN?

501
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,392
THEY WON'T ATTACK
FOR AT LEAST SEVERAL HOURS.

502
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,435
BY THEN, WITH LUCK,
WE'LL BE GONE.

503
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,686
IF I CAN GET
A FULL LOAD,

504
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,481
WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO ACHIEVE ORBIT
WITH ALL HANDS,

505
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,815
NOT THAT WE CAN
MAINTAIN IT LONG.

506
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,276
WE DON'T HAVE TO MAINTAIN IT
VERY LONG, MR. SCOTT.

507
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,568
IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS,

508
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,363
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> WILL BE
FORCED TO ABANDON ITS SEARCH

509
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,697
IN ORDER TO MAKE
A RENDEZVOUS.

510
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,450
IF WE CAN'T MAINTAIN ORBIT
AFTER THAT TIME,

511
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,411
IT WON'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

512
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,787
IF WE BURN UP
IN A DECAYING ORBIT

513
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,665
OR DIE HERE
ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE,

514
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,667
WE SHALL SURELY DIE.

515
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,337
DOCTOR, YOUR PHASER.

516

ALL RIGHT, SIR.

520
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,043
IN MY OPINION,
THE TRANSPORTERS ARE NOW
SAFE FOR HUMAN TRANSPORT.

521
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,086
GOOD.

00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,046

IT'S A BIG PLANET.

00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,765
IT'LL BE SHEER LUCK
IF OUR LANDING PARTIES
FIND ANYTHING.

528
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,350
I'M DEPENDING ON LUCK,

FOR CONVERSION, PLEASE,
DOCTOR.

AND YOU
HAND OVER HIS PHASER

536
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,684

HAPPENED AT ALL.

537
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,602

ARE YOU GOING?

540
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,525

OF MR. GAETANO.

THEN IF HE
FINDS HIM,

546

HE'S JUST AS LIABLE
TO ORDER HIM
TO STAY BEHIND.

VERY LONG, DID THEY?

00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,927
MOST ILLOGICAL REACTION.

554
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,180

OUR SUPERIOR WEAPONS.

555
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,849

SHOULD HAVE RESPECTED US?

IS A RATIONAL PROCESS.

OCCUR TO YOU

EMOTIONALLY, WITH ANGER?

DOCTOR, I AM NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR
THEIR UNPREDICTABILITY.

562
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,740
THEY WERE PERFECTLY
PREDICTABLE...

TO ANYONE
WITH FEELING.

564
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,327
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
ADMIT IT, MR. SPOCK,

565
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,581
YOUR PRECIOUS LOGIC
BROUGHT THEM DOWN ON US.

566
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,040
WHY HAVEN'T THEY
DONE ANYTHING?

IS INCREASINGLY HOSTILE.

THAT'S HOSTILE, MR. SPOCK.

A LITTLE INSPIRATION.

I HAVE MADE THE CORRECT
AND LOGICAL DECISIONS.

AND YET TWO MEN
HAVE DIED.

AND YOU'VE BROUGHT
OUR FURRY FRIENDS
DOWN ON US.

MISCALCULATED
REGARDING THEM

CANNOT BE GREATER

A LITTLE LESS ANALYSIS
AND MORE ACTION--

864
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,517

BUT IT WAS ALL YOU.

TOTALLY ILLOGICAL.

00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,988
THERE'S REALLY SOMETHING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

891
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,115
ABOUT ALL OF THIS,
AND MAYBE YOU CAN
EXPLAIN IT TO ME,

892
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,367
LOGICALLY, OF COURSE.

893
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,160
WHEN YOU JETTISONED THE FUEL
AND YOU IGNITED IT,

894
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,912
YOU KNEW THAT THERE WAS
VIRTUALLY NO CHANCE
OF IT BEING SEEN,

895
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,080
AND YET YOU DID IT ANYHOW.

896
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,290
NOW,
THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME

897
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,625
TO BE AN ACT
OF DESPERATION.

898
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,835
QUITE CORRECT, CAPTAIN.

899
00:47:58,959 --> 00:47:59,627
NOW, WE ALL KNOW,

900
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,796
AND I'M SURE THE DOCTOR
WOULD AGREE WITH ME

901
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,675
THAT DESPERATION
IS A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL
STATE OF MIND.

902
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,094
HOW DOES YOUR
WELL-KNOWN LOGIC
EXPLAIN THAT?

903
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,929
QUITE SIMPLY, CAPTAIN.

904
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,140
I EXAMINED THE PROBLEM
FROM ALL ANGLES,

905
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,684
AND IT WAS
PLAINLY HOPELESS.

906
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:18,062
LOGIC INFORMED ME THAT
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

907
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:22,024
THE ONLY POSSIBLE ACTION
WOULD HAVE TO BE ONE
OF DESPERATION.

LOGICALLY ARRIVED AT.

THAT IT WAS TIME
FOR AN EMOTIONAL
OUTBURST.

IN EXACTLY THOSE TERMS,

THE FACTS.
