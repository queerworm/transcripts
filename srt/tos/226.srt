THEY'RE NEEDED HERE.

698
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,181
MR. SEVEN, I WANT
TO BELIEVE YOU. I DO.

699
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,141
I MEAN, I KNOW THIS
WORLD NEEDS HELP.

700
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,603
THAT'S WHY SOME
OF MY GENERATION ARE
KIND OF CRAZY AND REBELS,

701
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,938
YOU KNOW? WE WONDER IF
WE'RE GONNA BE
ALIVE WHEN WE'RE 30.

702
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,358
Computer:
TWO MINUTES TO IMPACT.

703
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:56,735
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,
MR. SEVEN.

704
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,656
OH, NO.

705
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,075
SPOCK,
YOU'RE THE EXPERT.

706
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,827
CAN YOU DETONATE
THE WARHEAD FROM THIS COMPUTER?

707
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,454
I CAN TRY,
CAPTAIN.

708
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:09,624
Computer:
ALTITUDE--550 MILES.

709
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,083
[STATIC]

710
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:16,797
CAPTAIN, I WANT THAT
WARHEAD DETONATED, TOO.

711
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,758
UNLESS I DO IT
AT LEAST 100 MILES
ABOVE GROUND

712
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:23,179
JUST BARELY IN TIME
TO FRIGHTEN THEM OUT OF
THIS ARMS RACE--

713
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:24,805
Scotty:
CAPTAIN, MONITORS SHOW

714
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,974
ALL MAJOR POWERS
ON FULL MISSILE ALERT.

715
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,310
RETALIATORY STRIKE ORDERED
ON WARHEAD IMPACT.

716
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,853
Computer:
ALTITUDE--450 MILES.

717
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,690
SPOCK.

718
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,316
I CAN ESTIMATE
SOME OF THIS, CAPTAIN,
BUT WITHOUT MORE TIME...

719
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,026
CAPTAIN, HE CAN ONLY GUESS.

720
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,277
WILL YOU PLEASE
LET ME DO MY JOB?

721
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:39,320
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR JOB IS.

722
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,280
YOU MAY SET
THOSE CONTROLS

723
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,282
SO WE CAN'T DETONATE
THAT WARHEAD.

724
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,159
LISTEN, YOU,
GET AWAY FROM HIM!

725
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,078
ROBERTA,
BE CAREFUL.

726
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,789
THE SERVO
IS SET TO KILL.

727
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,545
Computer:
ALTITUDE--400 MILES.

728
00:45:56,921 --> 00:46:00,174
THERE ARE ONLY SECONDS.
I'LL NEED TIME
TO SET IT.

729
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,593
PLEASE. HE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH.

730
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,265
Computer:
55 SECONDS TO IMPACT.

731
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:11,810
SPOCK,
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TRUST HIM.

732
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:15,523
IT IS DIFFICULT
TO KNOW WHICH IS
BEST, CAPTAIN.

733
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,531
Computer:
40 SECONDS TO IMPACT.

734
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,992
WITHOUT FACTS,
THE DECISION CANNOT
BE MADE LOGICALLY.

735
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,160
YOU MUST RELY

736
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,829
ON YOUR HUMAN
INTUITION.

737
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:35,376
Computer:
ALTITUDE--300 MILES.

738
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,212
DESCENDING
AND ACCELERATING...

739
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,089
GO.

740
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,509
COMPUTER,
GO TO VISUAL.

741
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,930
COUNT BY 10s.

742
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,601
Computer:
190 MILES.

743
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,313
180 MILES.

744
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,941
170 MILES.

745
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:03,028
160 MILES.

746
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,656
150...

747
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:06,449
140...

748
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,784
130...

749
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,453
120...

750
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:24,300
Computer:
DETONATION--104 MILES.

751
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:36,771
AND IN SPITE
OF THE ACCIDENTAL
INTERFERENCE WITH HISTORY

752
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,982
BY THE EARTHSHIP
FROM THE FUTURE...

753
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,610
THE MISSION
WAS COMPLETED.

754
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:48,407
CORRECTION, MR. SEVEN.

755
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,160
IT APPEARS
WE DID NOT INTERFERE.

756
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,871
RATHER, THE "ENTERPRISE"
WAS SIMPLY PART OF WHAT
WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN

757
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,207
ON THIS DAY IN 1968.

758
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:59,960
AS OUR RECORD TAPES
SHOW, ALTHOUGH NEVER
GENERALLY REVEALED,

759
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:03,255
THAT ON THIS DATE,
A MALFUNCTIONING
SUBORBITAL WARHEAD

760
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:07,301
WAS EXPLODED
EXACTLY 104 MILES
ABOVE THE EARTH.

761
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:12,223
SO EVERYTHING HAPPENED
EXACTLY THE WAY IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO.

762
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:14,684
Spock: AND YOU'LL BE
PLEASED OUR RECORDS SHOW

763
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:18,813
THAT IT RESULTED
IN A NEW AND STRONGER
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT

764
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,523
AGAINST THE USE
OF SUCH WEAPONS.

765
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:23,067
WOULD YOU MIND
TELLING ME
WHO THAT IS?

766
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:27,071
THAT, MISS LINCOLN,
IS SIMPLY MY CAT.

767
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,615
YOUR CAT?

768
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,128
WHAT ELSE
DO YOUR RECORD
TAPES SHOW?

769
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,922
I'M AFRAID
WE CAN'T REVEAL
EVERYTHING WE KNOW,

770
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:46,883
MR. SEVEN.

771
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:51,429
CAPTAIN, WE COULD SAY
THAT MR. SEVEN
AND MISS LINCOLN

772
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,472
HAVE SOME
INTERESTING EXPERIENCES
IN STORE FOR THEM.

773
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,099
YES, I THINK WE
COULD SAY THAT.

774
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:59,729
TWO TO BEAM UP,
SCOTTY.

775
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,355
LIVE LONG AND PROSPER,
MR. SEVEN.

776
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,358
SAME TO YOU,
MISS LINCOLN.
ENERGIZE.
