1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,342
MORNING, SIR,

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,426
DOCTOR.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,348
SOMETHING WRONG?

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,726
YES. THERE'S SOMETHING ODD
ABOUT THAT MAN,

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,895
AND I CAN'T QUITE
PINPOINT IT.

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,814
PERHAPS YOU'RE MAKING
A RATHER HASTY JUDGMENT.

7
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:24,525
MR. NORMAN HAS ONLY
BEEN ABOARD 72 HOURS.

8
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,652
WELL, I KNOW WHEN SOMETHING
DOESN'T STRIKE ME RIGHT,

9
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:27,778
AND HE DOESN'T.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,112
SPECIFICS, DOCTOR.

11
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,782
LABELS DO NOT
MAKE ARGUMENTS.

12
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,367
ALL RIGHT.

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,661
THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG ABOUT A MAN
WHO NEVER SMILES,

14
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,162
WHOSE CONVERSATION
NEVER VARIES

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,455
FROM THE ROUTINE
OF THE JOB,

16
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,792
AND WHO WON'T TALK
ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND.

17
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,627
I SEE.

18
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:50,592
SPOCK, I MEAN THAT IT'S
ODD FOR A NON-VULCAN.

19
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,428
THE EARS MAKE ALL
OF THE DIFFERENCE.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,055
I FIND YOUR ARGUMENT
STREWN

21
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,017
WITH GAPING DEFECTS
IN LOGIC.

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,269
MAYBE, BUT YOU CAN'T
EVALUATE A MAN
BY LOGIC ALONE.

23
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,480
BESIDES, HE HAS AVOIDED
TWO APPOINTMENTS

24
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,191
THAT I'VE MADE
FOR HIS PHYSICAL EXAM
WITHOUT REASON.

25
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,943
THAT'S NOT AT ALL
SURPRISING, DOCTOR.

26
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,361
HE'S PROBABLY
TERRIFIED

27
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,780
OF YOUR BEADS
AND RATTLES.

28
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,123
COMMAND PERSONNEL ONLY.

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,851
YES, MR. SULU?

30
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,603
THERE'S AN UNPLANNED
COURSE CHANGE

31
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,230
BEING FED INTO
THE INSTRUMENTS, SIR.

32
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,273
CORRECT IT.

33
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,902
I CAN'T, SIR.

34
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,574
AUXILIARY CONTROL,
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

35
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,826
AUXILIARY CONTROL,
WHAT'S GOING ON
DOWN THERE?

36
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,496
SIR, AUXILIARY CONTROL
IS ON TOTAL OVERRIDE.

37
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,706
KIRK TO SECURITY.

38
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,708
SECURITY. LIEUTENANT
ROWE HERE, SIR.

39
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,709
INTRUDER ALERT--

00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,795
DECK EIGHT,
AUXILIARY CONTROL.

41
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,796
ACKNOWLEDGED.

42
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,922
LIEUTENANT UHURA,

43
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,966
HAVE MR. SPOCK REPORT
TO THE BRIDGE.

44
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,174
AYE, SIR.

45
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,844
WHAT'S THE IMPOSED COURSE,
MR. SULU?

46
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:20,307
TURNING ON
307 DEGREES, MARK 8.

47
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,809
BEING EXECUTED
NOW, SIR.

48
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,611
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

49
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,159
SECURITY TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,619
KIRK HERE.

51
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,413
LIEUTENANT ROWE, SIR.
I'M IN AUXILIARY CONTROL.

52
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,457
ENSIGN JORDAN'S
BEEN KNOCKED OUT.

53
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,501
THE DIRECTIONAL
MASTER CONTROLS
HAVE BEEN JAMMED.

54
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,543
THEY'RE TOTALLY UNWORKABLE.

55
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,544
ANY SIGN OF
THE INTRUDER?

56
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,046
NO, SIR. HE'S GONE.

57
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,548
I'VE PUT OUT A FULL
SECURITY ALERT
ON ALL DECKS.

58
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,800
FIND HIM. KIRK OUT.

59
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,430
MR. SPOCK, WE SEEM TO BE
TAKING AN UNSCHEDULED RIDE.

60
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,057
INTERESTING.

61
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,060
MR. SULU, CUT AN EMERGENCY
MANUAL MONITOR.

62
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,353
I WANT
THE OVERRIDE BROKEN.

63
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,940
SIR, THE INSTRUMENTS
WON'T RESPOND.

64
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,737
EMERGENCY MANUAL MONITOR,
REPORT.

65
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,322
THIS IS CAPTAIN KIRK.
ACKNOWLEDGE.

66
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,326
EMERGENCY MANUAL MONITOR,
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

67
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,536
REPORT.

68
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,455
HERE, YOU'RE
NOT ALLOWED--

69
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,957
ACKNOWLEDGE.
THIS IS THE
CAPTAIN.

70
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,208
SCOTTY,
ACKNOWLEDGE.

71
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,628
SCOTTY,
WHAT'S GOING ON
DOWN THERE?

72
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,088
KIRK TO ENGINEERING.

73
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,174
THIS IS THE
CAPTAIN. SCOTTY,
REPORT.

74
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,134
SCOTTY, THE INTRUDER'S
IN YOUR AREA.

75
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,517
WHAT'S GOING ON
DOWN THERE? SCOTTY?

76
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,649
CAPTAIN, HE'S HERE.

77
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,109
SCOTTY!

78
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,194
SCOTTY?

79
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,156
SCOTTY?

80
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,909
SECURITY, THE INTRUDER'S
IN THE ENGINEERING SECTION.

81
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,577
HAVE ALL UNITS
CONVERGE ON THAT POINT.

82
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,830
SIR, WE'RE PICKING UP
SPEED. WARP 5...6...
WARP 7, SIR.

83
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,249
CUT POWER.

84
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,418
I CAN'T, SIR.
ALL THE CONTROLS
ARE JAMMED.

85
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,502
SPOCK, TAKE OVER.

86
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,340
IT WILL NOT
BE NECESSARY,
CAPTAIN.

87
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,602
TELL SECURITY
WE'VE FOUND THE INTRUDER.

88
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,521
YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT, MISTER?

89
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,857
I AM IN TOTAL CONTROL
OF YOUR SHIP.

90
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,276
I HAVE CONNECTED THE
MATTER-ANTIMATTER PODS

91
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,238
TO THE MAIN
NAVIGATIONAL BANK.

92
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,907
A TRIGGER RELAY
IS NOW IN OPERATION.

93
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,700
ANY ATTEMPTS
TO ALTER COURSE

94
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,287
WILL RESULT IN THE
IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION
OF THIS VESSEL.

95
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,164
SPOCK?

96
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,457
CONFIRMED, CAPTAIN.

97
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,543
HE'S TAKEN OUT
ALL THE OVERRIDE CONTROLS.

98
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,254
IF WE TAMPER WITHOUT KNOWING

99
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,173
WHERE THE TRIGGER RELAY IS,

100
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,926
WE COULD
EXTINGUISH OURSELVES.

101
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,097
WHO ARE YOU?

102
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,181
I ASSURE YOU,

103
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,809
WE ARE NO THREAT
TO HUMANITY

104
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,853
OR HUMANOID LIFE.

105
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,397
WE MEAN YOU NO HARM,

106
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,733
BUT WE REQUIRE
YOUR SHIP.

107
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,111
YOU REQUIRE--

108
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,237
WHO AND WHAT
ARE "WE"?

109
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,553
SPACE--THE FINAL FRONTIER.

110
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,355
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

111
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,858
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--

112
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,443
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS,

113
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,323
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,

114
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,364
TO BOLDLY GO

115
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,284
WHERE NO MAN
HAS GONE BEFORE.

116
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,500
AN ANDROID.

117
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,502
AND MOST SOPHISTICATED.

118
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,089
I CONTROL
THE TRIGGER RELAY, SIR.

119
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,175
I CANNOT BE OVERCOME
BY PHYSICAL MEANS,

120
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,135
AND IF YOU ATTEMPT
TO USE YOUR PHASERS,

121
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,679
THE TRIGGER RELAY
WILL BE ACTIVATED.

122
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,723
WE SHALL CONTINUE ON
OUR PRESENT COURSE

123
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,475
FOR APPROXIMATELY
4 SOLAR DAYS,

124
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,353
AT WHICH TIME
WE SHALL ARRIVE

125
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,980
AT OUR DESTINATION.

126
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,065
WHO SENT YOU?

127
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,487
I AM NOT PROGRAMMED
TO RESPOND IN THAT AREA.

128
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,832
HE APPEARS TO HAVE
TURNED HIMSELF OFF,
CAPTAIN.

129
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,379
AND SINCE WE CANNOT
REPAIR THE DAMAGE
HE HAS DONE

130
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,713
WITHOUT DESTROYING
THE SHIP--

131
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,383
IT SEEMS WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE A LITTLE TRIP.

132
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,976
CAPTAIN'S LOG.
STARDATE 4513.3.

133
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,146
AFTER HAVING BEEN
TAKEN OVER BY AN ANDROID,

134
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,522
THE "ENTERPRISE"
HAS BEEN UNDERWAY AT WARP 7

135
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,442
FOR 4 DAYS.

136
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,111
NOW WE ARE ENTERING ORBIT
AROUND A PLANET

137
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,612
WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN CHARTED.

138
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,789
CAPTAIN KIRK.

139
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,710
THE FOLLOWING
INDIVIDUALS

140
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,214
WILL BE TRANSPORTED
DOWN TO OUR PLANET--

141
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,299
YOURSELF,

142
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,967
SCIENCE
OFFICER,

143
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,635
MEDICAL OFFICER,

144
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,471
COMMUNICATIONS
OFFICER,

145
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,097
AND NAVIGATOR.

146
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,807
ANY MEETINGS
OR DISCUSSIONS

147
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,309
CAN BE HELD ABOARD
THE "ENTERPRISE."

148
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,601
IF YOU DO NOT
COME WITH ME,

149
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,854
YOUR ENGINES
WILL BE DESTROYED

150
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,357
AND YOU WILL REMAIN
IN ORBIT HERE

151
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,984
FOREVER.

152
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,236
I MUST SAY, THAT'S
A GRACIOUS INVITATION.

153
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,364
THERE IS A WORD.

154
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:54,159
AMONG US THERE IS NO
CORRESPONDING MEANING,

155
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,953
BUT IT SEEMS
TO MEAN SOMETHING

156
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,122
TO YOU HUMANS.

157
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,749
AND WHAT IS THAT WORD?

158
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,834
PLEASE.

159
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,938
OUR PLANET'S SURFACE

160
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,816
IS WHAT YOU CLASSIFY
AS K-TYPE--

161
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,361
ADAPTABLE FOR HUMANS
BY USE OF PRESSURE DOMES

162
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,987
AND LIFE-SUPPORT
SYSTEMS.

163
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,826
I HAVE BROUGHT THEM.

164
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,203
HE IS WAITING.

165
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,582
IF YOU WILL
FOLLOW US, PLEASE?

166
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,845
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

167
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,056
WELCOME ABOARD, KIRK.

168
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,767
IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME, EH?

169
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,769
HARRY MUDD.

170
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,646
WELL, TO BE ABSOLUTELY
ACCURATE, LADDIE BUCK,

171
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,108
YOU SHOULD REFER TO ME
AS MUDD THE FIRST,

172
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,279
RULER OF THIS ENTIRE
SOVEREIGN PLANET.

173
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,821
RULER?

174
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,782
HARRY, I WANT
CONTROL OF MY SHIP
RETURNED IMMEDIATELY.

175
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,534
WE HAVE NO INTENTION
OF STAYING AS
YOUR GUESTS.

176
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,494
WELL, I'M AFRAID
THERE'S A BIT OF
A PROBLEM THERE.

177
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,537
KIRK TO
"ENTERPRISE."

178
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,538
ALICE...

179
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,663
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

180
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,045
NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW,
JAMIE BOY,

181
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:32,507
LET'S HAVE
NO UNAUTHORIZED
COMMUNICATIONS.

182
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,759
YOU KNOW THIS MAN,
CAPTAIN?

183
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,803
OH, DO I KNOW HIM.

184
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,972
HARCOURT FENTON MUDD--
THIEF...

185
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,973
OH, COME NOW.

186
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:40,974
SWINDLER AND CON MAN...

187
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:41,975
ENTREPRENEUR.

188
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,143
LIAR AND ROGUE.

189
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,936
DID I LEAVE YOU
WITH THAT IMPRESSION?

190
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:45,937
HE BELONGS IN JAIL,
WHICH IS WHERE

191
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:46,938
I THOUGHT
I LEFT YOU, MUDD.

192
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,399
AND THEREBY
HANGS A TALE,

193
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,859
BUT LOOK AROUND YOU, KIRK.

194
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,237
QUITE A PLACE HERE,
ISN'T IT?

195
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,989
I HOPE YOU'RE ALL
GOING TO ENJOY IT.

196
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,950
MUDD, I WANT
THAT TRAINED
MACHINE OF YOURS

197
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,245
NORMAN TO DEACTIVATE
THE TRIGGER
MECHANISM

198
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,455
AND FREE MY SHIP.

199
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,664
I SHALL DO THAT, KIRK,
WHEN I'M READY.

200
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,166
I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

201
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,628
AND I DO THE TELLING
ON THIS PLANET,
KIRK, OLD BOY.

202
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,795
YOU DO THE LISTENING.

203
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,549
ALL RIGHT, I'LL LISTEN.

204
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,968
WHAT ARE YOU
TELLING?

205
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,095
OOH! MERELY THAT YOU
MIGHT AS WELL

206
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,805
START ENJOYING
YOURSELVES.

207
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,681
IT'S REALLY A VERY,
VERY NICE PLACE,

208
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,143
AND YOU'RE ALL
GOING TO BE HERE

209
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:29,897
QUITE PROBABLY
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIVES.

210
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,941
HA HA HA HA!

211
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,750
HARRY MUDD,
LIAR AND AN OUTLAW
AND IN DEEP TROUBLE.

212
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,087
I WANT NAVIGATIONAL
CONTROL RESTORED,
MY SHIP RELEASED.

213
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,509
SORRY. THAT WOULD BE
AGAINST THE LAW, MY LAW,

214
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,303
DECREED BY MUDD THE FIRST,

215
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,931
VOTED IN
BY THE RESIDENT POPULATION.

216
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,433
HEH HEH HEH.

217
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,019
LOVELY, AREN'T THEY?

218
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,939
YOU MUST ADMIT, KIRK,
THAT I STILL RETAIN
MY EYE FOR BEAUTY.

219
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,693
I DECREED THAT I SHOULD
ALWAYS BE SURROUNDED BY IT,

220
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,404
AND MY DECREES
ALWAYS COME TO PASS.

221
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,040
I'VE HAD 500 OF THEM MADE UP
TO ATTEND ME...

222
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,884
ALL OF THEM IDENTICAL--

223
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,219
BEAUTIFUL...

224
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,845
COMPLIANT...

225
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,222
OBEDIENT.

226
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,099
500
OF THE SAME MODEL?

227
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,726
THAT SEEMS
RATHER REDUNDANT.

228
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,018
I HAVE A FONDNESS

229
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,312
FOR THIS PARTICULAR MODEL,
MR. SPOCK,

230
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,856
WHICH YOU, UNFORTUNATELY,

231
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,859
ARE ILL-EQUIPPED
TO APPRECIATE.

232
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,111
UH, TA TA TA TA.

233
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,322
[SNICKERING]

234
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,408
ALL RIGHT, HARRY,
EXPLAIN.

235
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,409
HOW DID YOU
GET HERE?

236
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,826
WE LEFT YOU
IN CUSTODY

237
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,496
AFTER THAT AFFAIR
ON THE RIGEL MINING
PLANET.

238
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:12,667
YES. WELL,
I ORGANIZED A TECHNICAL
INFORMATION SERVICE--

239
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,544
BRINGING MODERN
INDUSTRIAL TECHNIQUES

240
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,087
TO BACKWARD PLANETS,

241
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,381
MAKING AVAILABLE
CERTAIN VALUABLE PATENTS

242
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,092
TO STRUGGLING
YOUNG CIVILIZATIONS
THROUGHOUT THE GALAXY.

243
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,176
DID YOU PAY ROYALTIES

244
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,762
TO THE OWNERS
OF THOSE PATENTS?

245
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,055
UH...

246
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,516
WELL, ACTUALLY, KIRK,

247
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,102
AS A DEFENDER
OF THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM,

248
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,020
I FOUND MYSELF
IN A--

249
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,273
IN A RATHER
AMBIGUOUS CONFLICT

250
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,524
AS A MATTER
OF PRINCIPLE.

251
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,359
HE DID NOT
PAY ROYALTIES.

252
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,070
KNOWLEDGE, SIR,
SHOULD BE FREE TO ALL.

253
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,280
WHO CAUGHT YOU?

254
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,699
THAT, SIR, IS
AN OUTRAGEOUS ASSUMPTION.

255
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,033
YES. WHO CAUGHT YOU?

256
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:51,331
I, UH...I SOLD THE DENEBIANS
ALL THE RIGHTS

257
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,291
TO A VULCAN
FUEL SYNTHESIZER.

258
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,042
AND THE DENEBIANS
CONTACTED THE VULCANS.

259
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,127
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

260
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,045
THAT'S WHAT
I WOULD HAVE DONE.

261
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,880
WELL, IT'S TYPICAL
POLICE MENTALITY.

262
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,299
THEY'VE GOT
NO SENSE OF HUMOR.

263
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,592
THEY ARRESTED ME.

264
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:03,842
OH, I FIND THAT
SHOCKING.

265
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,219
WORSE THAN THAT.

266
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,556
DO YOU KNOW THE PENALTY
FOR FRAUD IS ON DENEB 5?

267
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,141
THE GUILTY PARTY
HAS HIS CHOICE--

268
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,352
DEATH BY ELECTROCUTION,
DEATH BY GAS,

269
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,313
DEATH BY PHASER,
DEATH BY HANGING--

270
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,149
THE KEY WORD IN YOUR
ENTIRE PERORATION,
MR. SPOCK,

271
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,402
WAS...D-DEATH.

272
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,696
BARBARIANS.

273
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,572
WELL, OF COURSE,
I LEFT.

274
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,324
HE BROKE JAIL.

275
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,950
I BORROWED
TRANSPORTATION.

276
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,160
HE STOLE
A SPACESHIP.

277
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,120
THE PATROL REACTED
IN A HOSTILE MANNER.

278
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,539
THEY FIRED
AT HIM.

279
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,457
THEY'VE GOT NO RESPECT
FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY.

280
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,250
THEY DAMAGED
THE BLOODY SPACESHIP.

281
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,921
WELL, I GOT AWAY,

282
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,465
BUT I COULDN'T NAVIGATE,

283
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,635
SO I WANDERED OUT
THROUGH UNMAPPED SPACE,

284
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:50,765
AND--AND HERE I FOUND...

285
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,433
MUDD.

286
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,268
YOU WENT TO SUBSTANTIAL
RISK AND EFFORT

287
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,645
TO BRING
A STARSHIP HERE.

288
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,399
LOGICALLY, YOU MUST HAVE
A COMPELLING MOTIVE.

289
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,108
SPOCK, YOU'RE GOING
TO LOVE IT HERE.

290
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,612
THEY ALL TALK
JUST THE WAY YOU DO.

291
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,322
GET ON WITH IT,
HARRY.

292
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,324
YES, WELL,
RIGHT, LADDIE BUCK.

293
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,076
SO HERE I AM
IN A PLANET

294
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,872
WITH OVER 200,000
HARD-WORKING,
HAPPY ANDROIDS,

295
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,458
ALL OF WHOM EXIST MERELY
TO SERVE MY EVERY...

296
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,669
WHIM.

297
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:24,006
IT'S ABSOLUTE...PARADISE.

298
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,509
THEN I AM UNABLE
TO DISCERN YOUR PROBLEM.

299
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,053
THEY WON'T LET ME GO.

300
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,513
THEY WANT TO STUDY ME.

301
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:34,100
THEY WANT TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS.

302
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,560
THEY PICKED
A FINE REPRESENTATIVE.

303
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,103
WATCH YOUR TONGUE, LAD.

304
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,147
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT MUDD THE FIRST.

305
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,608
WELL, ANYWAY,

306
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,193
I RAN OUT OF IDEAS.

307
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,612
I SIMPLY
RAN OUT OF THINGS

308
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,155
FOR THEM TO DO,

309
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,282
AND THEY INSISTED

310
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,743
THAT I BRING THEM
MORE HUMAN BEINGS.

311
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,830
THEY NEED HUMAN BEINGS
TO SERVE, TO STUDY.

312
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:59,834
SO I HAD TO PROMISE THEM
A PRIME SAMPLE.

313
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,921
A STARSHIP CAPTAIN--

314
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,505
BRIGHT, LOYAL,

315
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,133
FEARLESS,
AND IMAGINATIVE.

316
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,301
ANY CAPTAIN
WOULD HAVE DONE.

317
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,344
I WAS JUST LUCKY ENOUGH
TO GET YOU.

318
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,305
SO YOU ARE GOING TO
TAKE OVER FOR ME HERE,

319
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,057
AND I GET OFF THIS
ROCK AND BACK TO
CIVILIZATION.

320
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,016
I THINK NOT, HARRY.

321
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,268
YOU MISUNDERSTAND
ME, LAD.

322
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,354
I'M NOT ASKING YOU.
I'M TELLING YOU.

323
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,565
YOU'VE NO CHOICE.

324
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,024
SHOW THEM
TO THEIR QUARTERS.

325
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,568
- YES, MY LORD MUDD.
- YES, MY LORD MUDD.

326
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,694
THIS WAY,
PLEASE.

327
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,074
HARRY, WHAT'S THIS?

328
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,200
AH.

329
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,831
THAT, GENTLEMEN,
IS A SHRINE

330
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,458
TO THE MEMORY
OF MY BELOVED STELLA.

331
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,584
WHO?

332
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,336
STELLA, MY WIFE.

333
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,378
DEAD?

334
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,507
OH, NO, NO, NO.
MERELY DESERTED.

335
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,467
YOU SEE, GENTLEMEN,
BEHIND EVERY GREAT MAN

336
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,260
THERE IS A WOMAN
URGING HIM ON.

337
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,053
AND SO IT WAS
WITH MY STELLA.

338
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,306
SHE URGED ME ON
INTO OUTER SPACE.

339
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,224
NOT THAT SHE MEANT TO,

340
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,812
BUT WITH HER CONTINUAL,
ETERNAL,

341
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,524
CONFOUNDED NAGGING--

342
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,151
WELL, I THINK OF HER
CONSTANTLY,

343
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:11,656
AND EVERY TIME I DO
I GO FURTHER OUT
INTO SPACE.

344
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,449
THAT'S VERY
INTERESTING.

345
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,450
YOU LEAVE
YOUR WIFE

346
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,118
AND THEN
BRING HER ALONG.

347
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,746
I HAD THE ANDROIDS
CONSTRUCT A PERFECT
REPLICA OF STELLA

348
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,498
SO THAT I COULD
GAZE UPON HER

349
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,834
AND REJOICE
IN HER ABSENCE.

350
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,006
GENTLEMEN, ATTEND.

351
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,425
STELLA, DEAR.

352
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,093
MM, HARCOURT.

353
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,556
HARCOURT FENTON MUDD,
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

354
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,640
NOTHING GOOD,
I'M SURE.

355
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,017
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU,

356
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,935
YOU LAZY,
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING--

357
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:41,895
SHUT UP.

358
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:46,524
NOTHING...
THING...THING...

359
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,568
HA HA HA!
MARVELOUS, ISN'T IT?

360
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,863
I FINALLY HAVE
THE LAST WORD WITH HER

361
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,197
AND WITH YOU.

362
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,874
YOU WILL FIND THIS
QUITE COMFORTABLE.

363
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,667
YOUR QUARTERS ARE
DOWN THE HALL.

364
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,293
IF THERE IS
ANYTHING YOU NEED...

365
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,837
YES, MY SHIP.

366
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,547
WE ARE NOT
PROGRAMMED
TO RESPOND

367
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,715
IN THAT AREA.

368
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,467
NORMAN,
WHO CREATED YOU?

369
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,261
THE MAKERS
DESIGNED US.

370
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,931
THEY CAME FROM THE GALAXY
OF ANDROMEDA.

371
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,058
THEN YOUR MAKERS
WEREN'T HUMANOIDS.

372
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,852
THEY WERE, AS YOU SAY,
QUITE HUMANOID,

373
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,562
BUT, UNLIKE
YOUR CIVILIZATION,

374
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,606
ROBOTS WERE COMMON.

375
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,942
WE PERFORMED THE NECESSARY
SERVICE FUNCTIONS

376
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,902
AND FREED OUR MAKERS

377
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,571
TO EVOLVE
A PERFECT SOCIAL ORDER.

378
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,739
WHAT BECAME OF THEM?

379
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,951
OUR HOME PLANET'S SUN
BECAME A NOVA.

380
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,079
ONLY A FEW EXPLORATORY
OUTPOSTS SURVIVED.

381
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,289
THIS UNIT,

382
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,583
MYSELF,

383
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,543
WAS PART OF
ONE SUCH OUTPOST

384
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:48,920
IN YOUR GALAXY.

385
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,255
THEN SOME OF YOUR MAKERS
SURVIVED.

386
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,132
NO, CAPTAIN.

387
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,760
THEY DIED OVER
THE STRETCH OF TIME.

388
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,553
WHOM DO YOU
SERVE NOW?

389
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,514
- WE SERVE HARRY MUDD.
- WE SERVE HARRY MUDD.

390
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,767
HE HAS GIVEN US
PURPOSE AGAIN.

391
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,894
IT IS NECESSARY
TO HAVE PURPOSE.

392
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,105
WE LACKED IT
FOR A LONG TIME.

393
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,069
WE HAVE A VERY
EXTENSIVE LIBRARY
SECTION

394
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,862
FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT.

395
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,739
OUR RESEARCH LABORATORIES
AND WORKSHOPS

396
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,866
ARE EXTREMELY
WELL-EQUIPPED.

397
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,119
- YOU ARE FREE TO VISIT THEM.
- YOU ARE FREE TO VISIT THEM.

398
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,954
ALL RIGHT.
WE MIGHT LATER.

399
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,247
IN THE MEANTIME,
WOULD YOU MIND
LEAVING US?

400
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,750
- WHY SHOULD WE LEAVE YOU?
- WHY SHOULD WE LEAVE YOU?

401
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,461
BECAUSE WE DON'T
LIKE YOU.

402
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,879
NOW...
BUP BUP BUP.

403
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,343
WELL, OPINIONS?

404
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,095
I THINK WE'RE
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

405
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,596
THAT'S
A GREAT HELP,
MR. CHEKOV.

406
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,722
BONES?

407
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,974
WELL, I THINK
MR. CHEKOV'S RIGHT.

408
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,809
WE ARE IN A LOT
OF TROUBLE.

409
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,061
SPOCK--AND IF YOU SAY
WE'RE IN A LOT
OF TROUBLE--

410
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,270
WE ARE.

411
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,482
AND WE MUST
DIRECT OUR ATTACK

412
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,109
TO THE HEART
OF THE MATTER.

413
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,694
OBVIOUSLY,
THIS MANY ANDROIDS

414
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,570
CANNOT OPERATE
INDEPENDENTLY.

415
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,531
THERE MUST BE A CENTRAL
CONTROL SYSTEM

416
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,117
WHICH GUIDES THE ENTIRE
ANDROID POPULATION.

417
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,326
TRY AND FIND IT.
THE REST OF YOU,

418
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,078
LOOK AROUND. LEARN
EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

419
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,372
I'LL SEE WHAT ELSE
I CAN FIND OUT FROM
MR. MUDD. LET'S GO.

420
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,963
I TRUST YOU ARE
ENJOYING YOURSELF,
MR. SPOCK.

421
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,048
VERY INTERESTING.

422
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,300
VERY INTERESTING.

423
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,142
THIS IS A MOST
UNUSUAL DEVICE.

424
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:29,145
IT IS OUR CENTRAL
CONTROL COMPLEX.

425
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,230
OH?

426
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,398
DID I UNDERSTAND

427
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,901
THERE ARE MORE THAN
200,000 OF YOU?

428
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:39,446
207,809.

429
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,992
THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE
A SIMPLE RELAY CENTER.

430
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,953
ARE ALL OF YOU CONTROLLED
THROUGH THIS DEVICE?

431
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,039
[BEEPING]

432
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:56,005
I AM NOT PROGRAMMED
TO RESPOND IN THIS AREA.

433
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,008
OH, THAT'S...
QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE.

434
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,219
THESE ARE
OUR BARBARA SERIES.

435
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,930
THE BODY IS COVERED
WITH A SELF-RENEWING
PLASTIC

436
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,767
OVER A SKELETON
OF BERYLLIUM-TITANIUM ALLOY.

437
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,060
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

438
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,811
I SHOULD SAY SO.

439
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,355
WELL, I MUST SAY
I LIKE THE STYLING.

440
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,565
THEY WERE, OF COURSE,

441
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,359
MADE TO MY PERSONAL
SPECIFICATIONS,

442
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,361
AS INDEED WERE
THE MAIZIE SERIES,

443
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,696
THE TRUDY SERIES,

444
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,699
AND PARTICULARLY
THE ANNABELLE SERIES.

445
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,452
DON'T YOU BELIEVE
IN MALE ANDROIDS, HARRY?

446
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,620
MALE?

447
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,290
WELL, I SUPPOSE
THEY HAVE THEIR USES.

448
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,710
HOW LONG DOES A BODY
LIKE THAT LAST?

449
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,588
NONE OF OUR ANDROID BODIES
HAS EVER WORN OUT.

450
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,174
HOWEVER, THE ESTIMATED
DURATION OF THIS MODEL

451
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,051
IS 500,000 YEARS.

452
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:45,638
500,000...YEARS?

453
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,766
OUR MEDI-ROBOTS ARE ABLE
TO PLACE A HUMAN BRAIN

454
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,811
WITHIN A STRUCTURALLY
COMPATIBLE ANDROID BODY.

455
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,813
IMMORTALITY...

456
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,816
AND ETERNAL BEAUTY.

457
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,984
HMM?

458
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,910
CAPTAIN, I'VE JUST HAD
A MOST FASCINATING
MEETING WITH NORMAN,

459
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,245
AND I'M CONVINCED
THAT I'VE DISCOVERED

460
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:10,955
A VERY IMPORTANT
INCONSISTENCY.

461
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,958
WELL, I'M SO GLAD
YOU ENJOYED IT, DOCTOR.

462
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,793
JIM, YOU SHOULD SEE
THE RESEARCH FACILITIES.

463
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,004
THEY'VE GOT A LAB
DOWN THERE THAT...

464
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,006
WELL, I COULD SPEND THE REST
OF MY LIFE STUDYING IT.

465
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,507
I DO SO ADMIRE A MAN

466
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,009
WHO DEVOTES HIMSELF
TO KNOWLEDGE.

467
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,343
DON'T LOSE
YOUR HEAD, BONES.

468
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,719
NOBODY'S
STAYING ANYWHERE.

469
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,306
STUBBORN, KIRK.
STUBBORN.

470
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,807
I WOULDN'T BE BORED,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

471
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,185
LET GO OF ME!
NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING...

472
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:33,351
THE LAST ONE, LORD.

473
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,605
SPLENDID. SPLENDID.

474
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,191
WELCOME TO MUDD,
MR. SCOTT.

475
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,441
HARRY MUDD!

476
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,527
OH, YOU BOGUS
FRAT, YOU.

477
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,237
YOU'RE THE CAUSE
OF ALL THIS, ARE YOU?

478
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,864
SCOTTY, YOU
WERE ORDERED
TO STAY ABOARD.

479
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,700
AYE, SIR, AND I STAYED UNTIL
THAT FEMALE GARGANTUA

480
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,994
THREW ME INTO
THE TRANSPORTER BEAMS.

481
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,163
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN,
THE LAST ONE?

482
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,707
OH, DIDN'T I TELL YOU, KIRK?

483
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,417
I BEAMED A FEW DOZEN
ANDROIDS UP TO YOUR SHIP.

484
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,005
THEY'VE BEEN SENDING
YOUR CREW TO THE SURFACE
FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS.

485
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,132
THEY'RE ALL DOWN NOW.

486
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:06,344
ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

487
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,137
YOU CAN'T BEAM DOWN
AN ENTIRE CREW OF A
SPACESHIP.

488
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,347
SOMEBODY
HAS TO BE ON BOARD.

489
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,224
WELL, THERE IS
AN ENTIRE CREW ABOARD--

490
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,642
AN ENTIRE CREW
OF ANDROIDS.

491
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,769
THEY LEARN
VERY QUICKLY, CAPTAIN.

492
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,604
THE FACT IS...

493
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,023
I'VE TAKEN OVER
YOUR WHOLE SHIP.

494
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,150
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

495
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,871
HARRY...

496
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,999
HARRY, YOU'LL NEVER
GET AWAY WITH IT.

497
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,876
[GASPING]

498
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,627
WELL, WHO'S
TO STOP ME?

499
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,962
STARFLEET.

500
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,797
BUT NOW, CAPTAIN, NOW
I HAVE A SHIP OF MY OWN,

501
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,758
AND IT'S AS FAST AS ANY
IN THE FLEET.

502
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,094
SO HOW WILL THEY
CATCH ME, EH?

503
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,845
JUST THINK OF IT,
LADDIE BUCK.

504
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,514
HARRY MUDD WITH HIS
OWN CREW OF LOVELIES

505
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,933
ABOARD YOUR VESSEL.

506
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,934
THINK ABOUT THAT.

507
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,102
I'M TRYING NOT TO.

508
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:58,979
ALICE.

509
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,069
HE COULD SUCCESSFULLY
ACCOMPLISH IT, CAPTAIN.

510
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,779
I'VE QUESTIONED A NUMBER
OF THE ANDROIDS,

511
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,407
AND THEY ARE TOTALLY
LOYAL TO MUDD.

512
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,616
PERHAPS OF MORE CONCERN

513
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,868
IS THE FACT THAT
THIS ANDROID POPULATION

514
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,036
CAN LITERALLY PROVIDE

515
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,997
ANYTHING A HUMAN BEING
COULD ASK FOR

516
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,166
IN UNLIMITED QUANTITY.

517
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,458
YES, I KNOW. THAT'S
WHAT WORRIES ME.

518
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,002
HOW WILL MY CREW
REACT IN A WORLD

519
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,380
WHERE THEY CAN HAVE
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING
THEY WANT

520
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,841
SIMPLY BY ASKING FOR IT?

521
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,765
- YOU DESIRE SOMETHING, LORD?
- YOU DESIRE SOMETHING, LORD?

522
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,183
OH, YES, THANK YOU.

523

- 322.
- 322.

527
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,737
OH, WELL, IT DOESN'T
MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE.

528
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,488
YOU'RE BOTH LOVELY.

529
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,450
- THANK YOU, MY LORD.
- THANK YOU, MY LORD.

530
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,201
YOU DESIRE
SOMETHING ELSE, LORD?

531
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,962
WHAT A SHAME
YOU'RE NOT REAL.

532
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,422
WE ARE REAL, MY LORD.

533
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,718
OH, I MEAN REAL GIRLS.

534
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,137
WE ARE PROGRAMMED
TO FUNCTION

535
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,222
AS HUMAN FEMALES,
LORD.

536
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,307
YOU ARE?

537
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,351
- YES, MY LORD.
- YES, MY LORD.

- YES, MY LORD.
- YES, MY LORD.

540
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,814
THAT UNPRINCIPLED,
EVIL-MINDED,

00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,029
- YES, MY LORD.
- YES, MY LORD.

543
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,905
THIS PLACE IS EVEN BETTER
THAN LENINGRAD.

544
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,497
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.

545
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,207
HAND-WORKED TO
THE FINEST TOLERANCES,

546
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,126

AND A NANOPULSE LASER.

547
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,086
I'VE NEVER SEEN
HER LIKE BEFORE.

548
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,089
YOU MAY COMMAND US
TO MAKE ANYTHING
FOR YOU

549
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,634
OR DO THE WORK
YOURSELF
FOR PLEASURE.

550
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,053
YOU MAY HAVE
THE SERVICES
OF ANY NUMBER

551
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,595
OF CRAFTSMEN,

552
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:59,308
EXCLUSIVE USE
OF THE COMPUTER FACILITIES,

553
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,185
ANYTHING.

554
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,229
CAPTAIN, YOU SHOULD
SEE THIS SHOP.

555
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,939
WHY, THEY HAVE FACILITIES
WE'VE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF.

556
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,274
IS THAT THE WAY
YOU'RE GONNA
DO IT, MUDD?

557
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,818
HIT MY PEOPLE
AT THEIR
WEAKEST POINT?

558
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,114
WE ONLY WISH
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
AND COMFORTABLE, CAPTAIN.

559
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,200
IF WE ARE TO SERVE
YOUR KIND,

560
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,203
WE MUST
UNDERSTAND YOU.

561
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,414
OUR LORD HARRY MUDD

562
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,083
WAS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE
FOR US.

563
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:29,380
NOW WE ARE LEARNING
A GREAT DEAL
FROM ALL OF YOU.

564
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:32,299
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE ARE,
BIRDS IN A GILDED CAGE.

565
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,633
QUESTION IS, HOW DO
WE GET OUT OF HERE?

566
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,968
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

567
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,347
BUT IT'S A VERY NICE
GILDED CAGE.

568
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:41,808
Uhura: AND IT IS
A VERY PLEASANT
PLACE, CAPTAIN.

569
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,769
Scotty: WHAT DID THEY
OFFER YOU, UHURA?

570
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,438
OH, NOTHING
REALLY IMPORTANT,

571
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:50,401
JUST IMMORTALITY.

572
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,861
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GETTING
BACK TO THE SHIP,

573
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,447
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

574
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,198
STRAIGHTEN UP!

575
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,825
THIS MAY BE
A GILDED CAGE

576
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,120
FILLED WITH EVERYTHING
YOU ALWAYS WANTED,
BUT IT'S STILL A CAGE.

577
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,329
WE DON'T BELONG HERE.

578
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,166
WE BELONG ON THAT SHIP
UP THERE.

579
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,626
DO YOU REQUIRE
SOMETHING, LORD?

580
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,087
NO. YES!

581
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,505
MY SHIP.

582
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,714
I AM NOT PROGRAMMED...

583
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,259
"TO RESPOND
IN THAT AREA."
YES, I KNOW.

584
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,512
IS THERE ANYTHING
ANY OF YOU REQUIRE
TO PLEASE YOU?

585
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,181
ALICE...

586
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,892
GIVE US
BACK OUR SHIP
TO PLEASE US.

587
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,436
RETURN US
TO OUR SHIP

588
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,438
BECAUSE WE
DESIRE IT.

589
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,231
WE ARE PROGRAMMED
TO SERVE.

590
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,191
WE SHALL SERVE YOU
TO YOUR BEST INTERESTS

591
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,318
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

592
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,903
BUT WE'RE
UNHAPPY HERE.

593
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,697
PLEASE EXPLAIN UNHAPPY.

594
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,493
UNHAPPINESS IS THE STATE
WHICH OCCURS IN THE HUMAN

595
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,579
WHEN WANTS AND DESIRES
ARE NOT FULFILLED.

596
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,332
WHICH WANTS AND DESIRES
OF YOURS ARE NOT FULFILLED?

597
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,042
WE WANT THE
"ENTERPRISE."

[BEEPING]

599
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,345
THE "ENTERPRISE"
IS NOT A WANT OR A DESIRE.

600
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,763
IT IS A MECHANICAL DEVICE.

601
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,641
NO. IT'S
A BEAUTIFUL LADY,

602
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,724
AND WE LOVE HER.

603
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,477
[BEEPING]

604
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,727
ILLOGICAL. ILLOGICAL.

605
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,771
ALL UNITS RELATE.
ALL UNITS.

606
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,357
NORMAN, COORDINATE.

607
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,318
[STEADY BEEP]

608
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,488
UNHAPPINESS
DOES NOT RELATE.

609
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,696
WE MUST STUDY THIS.

610
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,289
INTERESTING.

611
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,583
FASCINATING.

612
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,502
BONES, HAVE YOU HAD
TIME TO TAKE

613
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,837
ANY PSYCHOLOGICAL
READINGS
OF THE ANDROIDS?

614
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,881
I DID, AND YOU CAN
FORGET IT.

615
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,257
THEY'RE PERFECT,
FLAWLESS,

616
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,676
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.

617
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,302
NO WEAKNESSES,
PERFECTLY DISCIPLINED,

618
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,262
NO VICES, NO FEARS,
NO FAULTS,

619
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,972
JUST A SENSE OF PURPOSE.

620
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,141
BELIEVE ME.
THERE'S NOTHING
TOUGHER TO OVERCOME,

621
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,394
EVEN AMONG HUMANS.

622
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,229
YES. THAT'S WHAT
THIS CREW NEEDS,

623
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,398
A LITTLE SENSE
OF PURPOSE.

624
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,114
MUDD, A FEW QUESTIONS
I WANT TO ASK YOU.

625
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,033
OOH! AFRAID
I WON'T HAVE TIME
TO ANSWER THEM.

626
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,243
MY BAGS ARE ALL PACKED.

627
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,411
THE ANDROIDS WILL
TAKE THE "ENTERPRISE"

628
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,496
OUT OF ORBIT IN
LESS THAN 24 HOURS,

629
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:10,624
BUT IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE
HAVING YOU HERE, KIRK.

630
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,251
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN GET FOR YOU?

631
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,586
YES. MY SHIP.

632
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,962
OH, YOU'RE A STUBBORN
FELLOW, AREN'T YOU?

633
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,215
BUT I DON'T MIND.
I DON'T MIND
THAT AT ALL

634
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,841
BECAUSE I'LL
BE LEAVING HERE
QUICKLY ENOUGH,

635
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:24,304
AND THEN YOU
CAN BE STUBBORN
AT YOUR OWN LEISURE.

636
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,847
ONE LAST TIME.

00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,152
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

640
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,447
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN UP TO?

641
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,532
HAVE YOU BEEN
DRINKING AGAIN?

642
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,659
YOU MISERABLE SOT!

643
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,620

WILL YOU HAVE MY BAGS
TRANSPORTED UP TO THE SHIP?

648
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,803
All: NO, MY LORD MUDD.

649
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,179
WHAT?

650
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,224
WE CAN NO LONGER
TAKE YOUR ORDERS,
HARRY MUDD.

651
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,183
WHY NOT?

652
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,227
OUR MAKERS
WERE WISE.

653
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,104
THEY PROGRAMMED US
TO SERVE.

654
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,064
YES, BUT THAT'S
WHAT I'M SAYING.

655
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,524
PUT MY BAGS
ON THE SHIP.

656
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,401
HARRY, I THINK THEY HAVE
SOMETHING ELSE IN MIND.

657
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,654
YOU ARE CORRECT,
CAPTAIN.

658
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:22,946
HARRY MUDD IS FLAWED,

659
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,157
EVEN FOR A HUMAN BEING.

660
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,992
WE RECOGNIZED THIS
FROM THE BEGINNING

661
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,745
BUT USED HIS KNOWLEDGE
TO OBTAIN MORE SPECIMENS.

662
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,164
YOUR SPECIES
IS SELF-DESTRUCTIVE.

663
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,082
YOU NEED OUR HELP.

664
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,793
WE PREFER
TO HELP OURSELVES.

665
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,670
WE MAKE MISTAKES,
BUT WE'RE HUMAN.

666
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:38,712
AND MAYBE
THAT'S THE WORD

667
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,380
THAT BEST
EXPLAINS US.

668
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,341
WE WILL NOT HARM YOU,

669
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,259
BUT WE WILL
TAKE THE STARSHIP,

670
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,053
AND YOU WILL REMAIN
ON THIS PLANET.

00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,485
PUT MY BAGS
ON THAT SHIP!

678
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,866
WE CANNOT
ALLOW ANY RACE

679
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,369
AS GREEDY
AND CORRUPTIBLE
AS YOURS

680
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,038
TO HAVE FREE RUN
OF THE GALAXY.

681
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,289
I'M CURIOUS, NORMAN,

682
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,957
JUST HOW DO YOU INTEND
TO STOP THEM?

683
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,584
WE SHALL SERVE THEM.

684
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,962
THEIR KIND WILL BE EAGER
TO ACCEPT OUR SERVICE.

685
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:24,675
SOON THEY WILL BECOME
COMPLETELY DEPENDENT
UPON US.

00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,177
THEIR AGGRESSIVE
AND ACQUISITIVE
INSTINCTS

687
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,887
WILL BE UNDER
OUR CONTROL.

688
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,681
WE SHALL...

689
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,808
TAKE CARE OF THEM.

690

CONTROLLED BY...

692
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,647
YOUR KIND?

693
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,106
YES, CAPTAIN.

694
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,525
AND WE SHALL
SERVE THEM,

695
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,861
AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY...

ITS AMUSING ASPECTS,

THE ANDROIDS MADE

699
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,293
ABOUT TAKING OVER
ALL THE HUMANS

700
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,795

701

00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:11,221
WHATEVER METHOD WE USE TO STOP
THEM, WE MUST MAKE HASTE.

705

THEY HAVE ONLY TO INSTALL
SOME CYBERNETIC DEVICES
ABOARD THE "ENTERPRISE,"

SO MUCH?

708

OH.

ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS?

710
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,068

DO ANYTHING TO STOP THEM.

722
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,425
WELL, THEY'RE JUST NOT
CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT,

723
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,135
YET THE DEVICE
THAT NORMAN CLAIMS

724
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,553
TO BE THEIR
CENTRAL CONTROL

725
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,931

TO THE TASK OF DIRECTING

726
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,099

OF THEM.

727
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,603

TO MY RESEARCH,

732
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,114

735
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,166

ONE OF THE ALICES

736
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,542
THAT THE "ENTERPRISE"
WAS A LOVELY LADY

737
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,752
AND WE LOVED HER,

738

SHE SAID, "NORMAN,
COORDINATE."

739
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,089
WHY NORMAN?
UNLESS...

740
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,341

AS THEY DO,

741
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,302

MUST BE ONE COMPONENT

742
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,095

743
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,348

A CENTRAL LOCUS...

744
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,724
NAMED NORMAN.

745
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:41,520

HIGHLY INTELLIGENT MIND.

746
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,940

BADGES...

747
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:47,567
THEY INDICATE
THE MIND IN OPERATION.

748
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,068
THAT WOULD SEEM LOGICAL.

749
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,863
YES, LOGICAL.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS,

750
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,365
AND THAT IN TURN
GIVES US A WEAPON THAT
WE CAN USE AGAINST THEM.

751
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:58,077
WE MUST USE

IRRATIONAL ILLOGIC
