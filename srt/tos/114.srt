<i>IN OUR NEXT ACTION,</i>

REFERRING TO THE MAP
ON YOUR SCREENS,

00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,379
YOU WILL NOTE BEYOND
THE MOVING POSITION
OF OUR VESSEL

71
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,506
A LINE OF EARTH
OUTPOST STATIONS.

72
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,384
CONSTRUCTED ON ASTEROIDS,
THEY MONITOR

73
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,344
THE NEUTRAL ZONE
ESTABLISHED BY TREATY

74
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,680
AFTER THE EARTH-ROMULAN
CONFLICT

75
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,099
OF OVER A CENTURY AGO.

76
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,559
<i>AS YOU MAY RECALL</i>
<i>FROM YOUR HISTORIES,</i>

77
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,187
<i>THIS CONFLICT WAS FOUGHT,</i>
<i>BY OUR STANDARDS TODAY,</i>

78
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,189
<i>WITH PRIMITIVE</i>
<i>ATOMIC WEAPONS</i>

79

<i>AND IN PRIMITIVE</i>
<i>SPACE VESSELS</i>

80
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,235
WHICH ALLOWED
NO QUARTER,

81
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,820
NO CAPTIVES,

82
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,615
NOR WAS THERE
EVEN SHIP-TO-SHIP
VISUAL COMMUNICATION.

83
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,661
THEREFORE, NO HUMAN,
ROMULAN, OR ALLY

84
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,913
HAS EVER SEEN THE OTHER.

85
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,500
EARTH BELIEVES
THE ROMULANS TO BE WARLIKE,

86
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,460
CRUEL, TREACHEROUS,

87
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,462
AND ONLY
THE ROMULANS KNOW

88
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,547
WHAT THEY THINK
OF EARTH.

89
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,759
THE TREATY,
SET BY SUB-SPACE RADIO,

90
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,262
ESTABLISHED
THIS NEUTRAL ZONE,

91
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,848
ENTRY INTO WHICH
BY EITHER SIDE

92
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,059
WOULD CONSTITUTE
AN ACT OF WAR.

93
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,229
THE TREATY HAS BEEN
UNBROKEN SINCE THAT TIME.

94
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,897
CAPTAIN.

95
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,359
WHAT YOU DO NOT KNOW
AND MUST NOW BE TOLD

96
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,487
IS THAT MY COMMAND ORDERS
ON THIS SUBJECT

97
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,613
ARE PRECISE AND INVIOLABLE.

98
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,867
NO ACT, NO PROVOCATION
WILL BE CONSIDERED

99
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,161
<i>SUFFICIENT REASON</i>
<i>TO VIOLATE THE ZONE.</i>

100
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,290
<i>WE MAY DEFEND OURSELVES,</i>
<i>BUT, IF NECESSARY</i>

101
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,542
TO AVOID INTERSPACE WAR,

102
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,628
BOTH THESE OUTPOSTS
AND THIS VESSEL

103
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,463
WILL BE CONSIDERED
EXPENDABLE.

104
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,090
CAPTAIN OUT.

105
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,844
WE KNOW OUTPOST 4
HAS BEEN ATTACKED, SIR,

106
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,846
SO IF WE INTERCEPT
ROMULANS NOW--

107
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,016
AFTER A WHOLE CENTURY,
WHAT WILL A ROMULAN SHIP
LOOK LIKE, MR. STILES?

108
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,976
I DOUBT IF THEY'LL RADIO
AND IDENTIFY THEMSELVES.

109
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,812
YOU'LL KNOW, SIR.
THEY'RE PAINTED LIKE
A GIANT BIRD OF PREY.

110
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,023
I HAD NO IDEA THAT HISTORY
WAS YOUR SPECIALTY.

111
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,067
FAMILY HISTORY.

112
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,569
THERE WAS A CAPTAIN STILES
IN THE SPACE SERVICE THEN,

113
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,821
TWO COMMANDERS,
SEVERAL JUNIOR OFFICERS--

114
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,865
ALL LOST
IN THAT WAR, SIR.

115
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,201
<i>THEIR</i> WAR,

116
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,163

117
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,540
DON'T FORGET IT.

118
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,085
YES, SIR.

121
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,300
YES, CAPTAIN.

122
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,220

00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,818
CONFIRM WHAT

00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,445

<i>SPACE VESSEL,</i>

179

184
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,713

185
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,815

186
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,444
<i>MY COMMAND POST HERE.</i>

187

<i>WE'RE A MILE DEEP</i>

190
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,286

191
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,579
<i>CAN YOU SEE?</i>

192
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,871
AFFIRMATIVE.
YOUR VISUAL.

193
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,623

194
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,459

198
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,385
<i>SOME FORM</i>

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,304
<i>FANTASTIC POWER.</i>

00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,391

217
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,628
DISINTEGRATED,

218
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,424
POSITION
OF THE INTRUDER,
MR. SPOCK.

219
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,092
DISAPPEARED.

220
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,555
INTERESTING HOW THEY BECAME
VISIBLE FOR JUST A MOMENT.

221
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,721
WHEN THEY OPENED FIRE.

222
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,142
PERHAPS NECESSARY WHEN
THEY USE THEIR WEAPONS.

223
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,562
I HAVE A BLIP ON
THE MOTION SENSOR, CAPTAIN.

224
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,812
COULD BE THE INTRUDER.

225
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,314
GO TO FULL MAGNIFICATION.

226
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,483
SCREEN IS ON
FULL MAG, SIR.

227
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,072
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

228
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,451
CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

229
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,495
INVISIBILITY IS
THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE,
CAPTAIN--

230
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,497
SELECTIVE BENDING
OF LIGHT--

231
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,499
BUT THE POWER COST
IS ENORMOUS.

232
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,749
THEY MAY HAVE SOLVED
THAT PROBLEM.

233
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,503
CONTINUING TO CHALLENGE, SIR.
STILL NO RESPONSE.

234
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,753
DISCONTINUE.

235
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,464
CONTACT REMAINING
OUTPOSTS.

236
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,840
HAVE THEM SIGNAL US

237
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,135
ANY SIGHTINGS
OR SENSOR READINGS
IN THEIR AREA.

238
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,221
BLIP HAS CHANGED
ITS HEADING, CAPTAIN.

239
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,308
AND IN A VERY
LEISURELY MANEUVER.

240
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,103
THEY MAY NOT BE
AWARE OF US.

241
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,480
THEIR INVISIBILITY SCREEN
MAY WORK BOTH WAYS.

242
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,400
WITH THAT KIND
OF POWER CONSUMPTION,

243
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,236
THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO SEE US.

244
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,322
HIS HEADING
IS NOW 111...

245
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,866
MARK 14--

246
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,202
THE EXACT HEADING
A ROMULAN VESSEL

247
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,871
WOULD TAKE, JIM,
TOWARD THE NEUTRAL ZONE...

248
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,498
AND HOME.

249
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,216
PARALLEL COURSE.

250
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,302
DON'T YOU MEAN
INTERCEPTION COURSE, SIR?

251
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,011
NEGATIVE.
YOU AND MR. SULU

252
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,680
WILL MATCH COURSE
AND SPEED

253
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,683
WITH THE OBJECT ON
OUR SENSORS EXACTLY,
MOVE FOR MOVE.

254
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,393
IF HE HAS SENSORS,

255
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,853
I WANT HIM TO
THINK THAT WE'RE
A REFLECTION,

256
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,482
AN ECHO.

257
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,400
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
ARE YOU TO CROSS
INTO THE NEUTRAL ZONE

258
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,943
WITHOUT
MY DIRECT ORDERS.

259
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,487
ACKNOWLEDGED, SIR.

260
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,862
CANCEL
BATTLE STATIONS.

261
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,490
ALL DECKS--
STANDBY ALERT.

262
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,907
CANCEL
BATTLE STATIONS, SIR.

263
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,367
CAPTAIN.

264
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,953
MAY I RESPECTFULLY
REMIND THE CAPTAIN
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?

265
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,413
THE ROMULANS HAVE CROSSED
THE NEUTRAL ZONE,

266
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,872
ATTACKED OUR OUTPOSTS,
KILLED OUR MEN.

267
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,458
MR. STILES--

268
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,335
ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT
IT WAS A SNEAK ATTACK.

269
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,170
MR. STILES, ARE YOU
QUESTIONING MY ORDERS?

270
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,213
NEGATIVE, SIR.
I'M POINTING OUT

271
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,008
THAT WE COULD
HAVE ROMULAN SPIES
ABOARD THIS SHIP.

272
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,222
I AGREE, SIR.

273
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,391
RESPECTFULLY
RECOMMEND

274
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,644
ALL DECKS MAINTAIN
SECURITY ALERT.

275
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,355
VERY WELL.

276
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,607
ALL DECKS--
SECURITY ALERT.

277
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,526
SECURITY ALERT, SIR.

278
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,571
PICKING UP
COMMUNICATIONS, SIR.

279
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,158
IT'S FROM THEIR SHIP.

280
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,743
PIPE IT IN.

281
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,498
SOUNDS LIKE CODE, SIR.

282
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,667
I HAVE A FIX ON IT,
CAPTAIN.

283
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,212
I BELIEVE
I CAN LOCK ON IT,

284
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,422
GET A PICTURE
OF THEIR BRIDGE.

285
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,675
PUT IT
ON THE SCREEN.

286
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,082
DECODING?

287
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,042
CRYPTOGRAPHY
IS WORKING ON IT, SIR.

288
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,044
GIVE IT TO SPOCK.

289
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,589
I DIDN'T QUITE
GET THAT, MR. STILES.

290
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,006
NOTHING, SIR.

291
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,300
REPEAT IT.

292
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,135
I WAS SUGGESTING
THAT MR. SPOCK

293
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,305
COULD PROBABLY
TRANSLATE IT
FOR YOU, SIR.

294
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,057
I ASSUME YOU'RE
COMPLIMENTING MR. SPOCK
ON HIS ABILITY TO DECODE.

295
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,936
I'M NOT SURE, SIR.

296
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:22,106
WELL, HERE'S ONE THING
YOU CAN BE SURE OF, MISTER--

297
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,609
LEAVE ANY BIGOTRY
IN YOUR QUARTERS.

298
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,528
THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR IT ON THE BRIDGE.

299
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,988
DO I MAKE
MYSELF CLEAR?

300
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,783
YOU DO, SIR.

301
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,207
TRANSMISSION
HAS BEEN CUT OFF.

302
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,962
I MADE A TAPE
OF IT, SIR.

303
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,630
VERY WELL.

304
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,012
[TRANSMISSION PLAYING]

305
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,604
SOMETHING VISUAL AHEAD,
CAPTAIN,

306
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,690
AT EXTREME RANGE.

307
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,195
HE'S CHANGING
COURSE, SIR.

308
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,572
STAY WITH HIM,
HELM.

309
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,407
TURNING, SIR.

310
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,797
WE GROW VISIBLE.
ATTEND THE CLOAKING SYSTEM.

311
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,842
IT CONSUMES MUCH POWER,
COMMANDER, WITH NO ENEMY
TO CONCERN US.

312
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,135
THAT EARTH OUTPOST
CALLED TO AN EARTH VESSEL.

313
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,679
NOW IT FOLLOWS US.

314
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,306
WHICH NEITHER RETREATS
NOR GROWS NEAR, WHICH
TURNS AS WE TURN.

315
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,727
COMMANDER, IT IS
OUR JUDGMENT WE RUN
FROM A REFLECTION.

316
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,938
PERHAPS SO,
BUT MY JUDGMENT PREVAILS.

317
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,951
CLOAKING SYSTEM
ON, SIR.

318
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,791
IT IS GOOD WE APPROACH
THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

319
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:08,421
NOT TOO SOON FOR ME
TO SEE THE STARS OF HOME.

320
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,550
I KNOW THEY ARE
FOLLOWING.

321
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,260
IF AN EARTH SHIP,

322
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,430
WHY DOES HE
NOT ATTACK?

323
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,142
FIRST STUDY THE ENEMY,

324
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,227
SEEK WEAKNESS.

325
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,229
IF I WERE
THEIR COMMANDER,

326
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,941
THAT IS WHAT
I WOULD DO.

327
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,031
MY COMMANDER
SENT FOR DECIUS.

328
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,617
A MESSAGE WAS DISPATCHED.

329
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,286
YOU'VE BROKEN
THE RULE OF SILENCE.

330
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,204
ONLY IN CODE, COMMANDER,
TO INFORM OUR PRAETOR

331
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,540
OF THIS GLORIOUS MISSION.

332
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,084
YOUR CARELESSNESS
MIGHT HAVE ENDED

333
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,336
THIS GLORIOUS MISSION.

334
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,298
YOU'RE REDUCED
TWO STEPS IN RANK.
RETURN TO POST.

335
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,433
TAKE CARE,
COMMANDER.

336
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,645
HE HAS FRIENDS,

337
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,355
AND FRIENDS OF
HIS KIND MEAN POWER,

338
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,190
AND POWER IS DANGER.

339
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,902
DANGER AND I
ARE OLD COMPANIONS.

340
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,445
WE'VE SEEN A HUNDRED
CAMPAIGNS TOGETHER,

341
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,197
AND STILL I DO NOT
UNDERSTAND YOU.

342
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,284
I THINK YOU DO.
NO NEED TO TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENS

343
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,122
THE MOMENT
WE REACH HOME WITH PROOF
OF THE EARTHMEN'S WEAKNESS,

344
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,082
AND WE WILL HAVE PROOF.

345
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,084
THE EARTH COMMANDER
WILL FOLLOW. HE MUST.

346
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,962
AND WHEN HE ATTACKS,
WE WILL DESTROY HIM.

347
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,048
OUR GIFT TO THE HOMELAND--
ANOTHER WAR.

348
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,635
IF WE ARE THE STRONG,
IS THIS NOT
THE SIGNAL FOR WAR?

349
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,846
MUST IT ALWAYS BE SO?

350
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,222
HOW MANY COMRADES
HAVE WE LOST IN THIS WAY?

351
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,350
OUR PORTION,
COMMANDER...

352
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:46,936
IS OBEDIENCE.

353
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,147
OBEDIENCE...

354
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,148
DUTY.

355
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,608
DEATH AND MORE DEATH.

356
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,320
SOON EVEN ENOUGH
FOR THE PRAETOR'S TASTE.

357
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,075
CENTURION...

358
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,120
I FIND MYSELF
WISHING FOR DESTRUCTION

359
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,330
BEFORE WE CAN RETURN.

360
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,713
WORRY NOT.

361
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,924
LIKE YOU, I AM
TOO WELL-TRAINED IN MY DUTY

362
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,093
TO PERMIT IT.

363
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,095
CONTINUE
EVASIVE MANEUVERS.

364
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,223
NOW BACK
TO THE FIRST COURSE.

365
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,984
THEY'RE TURNING, SIR.

366
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,944
WE'RE STAYING
WITH THEM.

367
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,697
STEADY ON 111 MARK 14.

368
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,116
BACK ON THEIR ORIGINAL
COURSE, CAPTAIN,

369
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,118
TOWARD THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

370
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,961
WHAT'S OUR POSITION,
NAVIGATOR?

371
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,674
WE'LL ENTER THE NEUTRAL ZONE
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR, SIR,

372
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,096
ASSUMING, OF COURSE,
THAT WE DON'T TURN BACK.

373
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,098
<i>[SCOTT]</i>
<i>WE NOW HAVE ABOARD</i>

374
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,725
<i>DEBRIS FROM OUTPOST 4,</i>
<i>CAPTAIN.</i>

375
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,103
BRING IT
TO THE BRIEFING ROOM.

376
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,312
ARE YOU READY,
GENTLEMEN?

377
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,118
FROM THE OUTPOST
PROTECTIVE SHIELD--

378
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,078
CAST RODINIUM.

379
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,122
THIS IS THE HARDEST
SUBSTANCE

380
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,331
KNOWN TO OUR SCIENCE.

381
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,172
LAB THEORIZES
AN ENVELOPING
ENERGY PLASMA

382
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,134
FORCING
AN IMPLOSION.

383
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,969
COMMENTS?

384
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,389
OBVIOUSLY, THEIR WEAPONRY
IS SUPERIOR TO OURS,

385
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,601
AND THEY HAVE A PRACTICAL
INVISIBILITY SCREEN.

386
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,727
YOU'RE DISCUSSING
TACTICS.

387
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,106
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT
THIS REALLY COMES DOWN TO?

388
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,650
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF LIVES HANGING ON WHAT
THIS VESSEL DOES NEXT.

389
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,736
OR ON WHAT
THIS VESSEL FAILS
TO DO, DOCTOR.

390
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,738
YES. WELL, GENTLEMEN,
THE QUESTION STILL REMAINS.

391
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,825
CAN WE ENGAGE THEM WITH
A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY
OF VICTORY?

392
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,786
NO QUESTION.
THEIR POWER IS
SIMPLE IMPULSE.

393
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:09,662
MEANING WE CAN OUTRUN THEM?

394
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,540
TO BE USED
IN CHASING THEM
OR RETREATING...SIR?

395
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,169
GO AHEAD, MR. STILES.
I CALLED THIS SESSION
FOR OPINIONS.

396
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,963
WE HAVE TO ATTACK
IMMEDIATELY.
EXPLAIN.

397
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,798
THEY'RE STILL ON OUR SIDE
OF THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

398
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,092
THERE WOULD BE NO DOUBT
THAT THEY BROKE THE TREATY.

399
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,343
ATTACK WITHOUT
A VISIBLE TARGET?

400
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,847
HOW DO WE
AIM OUR PHASERS?

401
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,890
AIM WITH SENSORS.
NOT ACCURATE, BUT IF
WE BLANKET THEM--

402
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,059
HOPE FOR
A LUCKY SHOT BEFORE
THEY ZERO IN ON US?

403
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,602
AND IF WE DON'T?

404
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,772
ONCE BACK,
THEY'LL REPORT WE SAW
THEIR WEAPONS AND RAN.

405
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,400
AND IF THEY COULD REPORT
THAT THEY DESTROYED US?

406
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,030
THESE ARE ROMULANS!
YOU RUN AWAY FROM THEM,
AND YOU GUARANTEE WAR.

407
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,948
THEY'LL BE BACK--
NOT JUST ONE SHIP,

408
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,700
BUT WITH EVERYTHING
THEY'VE GOT.

409
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,910
YOU KNOW THAT,
MR. SCIENCE OFFICER.

410
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:53,289
YOU'RE THE EXPERT IN THESE
PEOPLE, BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS
LEFT OUT THAT ONE POINT.

411
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,499
WHY? I'M VERY
INTERESTED IN WHY.

412
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,212
SIT DOWN, MISTER.

413
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,512
I AGREE.

414
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,638
ATTACK.

415
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,477
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
WE FIGHT TO PREVENT
A FIGHT?

416
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,104
BASED ON WHAT?

417
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,190
MEMORIES OF A WAR
OVER A CENTURY AGO?

418
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:22,318
ON THEORIES ABOUT
A PEOPLE WE'VE NEVER
EVEN MET FACE TO FACE?

419
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,237
WE KNOW WHAT
THEY LOOK LIKE.

420
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,655
YES. INDEED WE DO,
MR. STILES.

421
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,200
AND IF THE ROMULANS
ARE AN OFFSHOOT
OF MY VULCAN BLOOD--

422
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,285
AND I THINK THIS
LIKELY--

423
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,453
THEN ATTACK BECOMES
EVEN MORE IMPERATIVE.

424
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,497
WAR IS NEVER
IMPERATIVE, MR. SPOCK.

425
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,499
IT IS FOR THEM, DOCTOR.

426
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,584
VULCAN, LIKE EARTH,

427
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,460
HAD ITS AGGRESSIVE
COLONIZING PERIOD,

428
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,589
SAVAGE EVEN
BY EARTH STANDARDS.

429
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,217
IF THE ROMULANS RETAIN
THIS MARTIAL PHILOSOPHY,

430
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,969
THEN WEAKNESS
IS SOMETHING
WE DARE NOT SHOW.

431
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,597
DO YOU WANT
A GALACTIC WAR
ON YOUR CONSCIENCE?

432
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,019
CAPTAIN TO BRIDGE.

433
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,104
<i>THIS IS UHURA,</i>

434
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,647

<i>COURSE UNCHANGED, SIR.</i>
<i>ESTIMATING TREATY BOUNDARY</i>
<i>IN 21 MINUTES.</i>

436
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,152
ARE YOU CONTINUING
TO BROADCAST
TACTICAL REPORTS?

437
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,320
<i>AFFIRMATIVE, CAPTAIN.</i>

438
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,364

439
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,325
<i>APPROXIMATELY THREE HOURS</i>
<i>BEFORE RECEIVING A REPLY</i>
<i>TO OUR FIRST MESSAGE.</i>

440
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,701
THANK YOU, LIEUTENANT.

441
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,079
CHECK OUR COURSE AHEAD,
MR. SPOCK.

442
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,123
A COMET,
MAGNITUDE 7,

443
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,665
DEAD AHEAD,

444
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,086
AND THE INTRUDER
CHANGING COURSE
TOWARD IT.

445
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,504
COMET ICARUS-4.
COMPOSITION?

446
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,756
QUITE ORDINARY.

447
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,302
AN IONIZED MASS,
A TRAIL OF FROZEN
VAPOR PARTICLES.

448
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:32,888
AND WHEN AN OBJECT
PASSES THROUGH IT,
EVEN AN INVISIBLE OBJECT...

449
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,681
IT LEAVES
A VISIBLE TRAIL.

450
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,100
AH!

451
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,768
OUR CHANCE, GENTLEMEN.

452
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,147
PREPARE TO ATTACK.
ALL HANDS--BATTLE STATIONS.

453
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,316

454
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:48,112
I HOPE WE WON'T
NEED YOUR SERVICES,
BONES.

455
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,613
AMEN TO THAT.

456
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,490
YOU'RE TAKING
A BIG GAMBLE, JIM.

457
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,438

458
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,814
ALL STATIONS MANNED,

459
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,191

460
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,567
SET FOR
PROXIMITY BLAST.

461
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,321

FOR COMET'S TAIL.

462
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,323
PLOT HIS EXACT POINT
OF ENTRY, MR. STILES.

463
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,575
COMPUTED.
ON THE BOARD, SIR.

464
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,536
THE MOMENT HE BEGINS
ENTERING THE COMET'S TAIL,
HE BECOMES VISIBLE.

465
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,414
END RUN, GENTLEMEN.

466
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,209
WE'LL SWING AROUND
THE OTHER SIDE

467
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,543
AND CATCH HIM
AT THAT MOMENT.

468
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,462
ACKNOWLEDGED,
CAPTAIN.

469
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,672
HE'S MAINTAINING
THAT BEARING, CAPTAIN.

470
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,258
LET'S GET HIM,
MR. SULU.

471
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,016
HOW PLEASING
TO THE EYE IT IS.

472
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,185
BEHOLD A MARVEL

473
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,730
YOU SPOKE

474
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,940
ITS MANY PARTICLES
WILL OBSCURE

475
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,151
THEIR SENSING DEVICE,
CENTURION.

476
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,945
WE ENTER IT,
COMMANDER.

477
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,786
ONCE FULLY OBSCURED,

478
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:23,374
WE WILL TURN SUDDENLY BACK
UPON OUR ADVERSARY.

479
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,042
AT LAST THE SCREEN
IS CLEAR, COMMANDER.

480
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,002
CLEAR?

481
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,046
OUR REFLECTION NO
LONGER FOLLOWS US.

482
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,925
ESCAPE MANEUVER ONE!
QUICKLY!

483
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,942
WE'RE LOSING SENSOR
CONTACT, CAPTAIN.

484
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,110
STEADY AS SHE GOES.

485
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,237
PHASER CREWS READY?

486
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,072
PHASER CREWS
SIGNAL READY, SIR.

487
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,950
HE'LL ONLY
BE VISIBLE
FOR A MOMENT.

488
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,953
STAND BY.

489
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,383
SIR...

490
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,552
[SPOCK]
AT THE LAST MOMENT,
HE MUST HAVE--

491
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,472
GUESSED OUR MOVE.
HARD ASTARBOARD,
HELM!

492
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,140
HARD ASTARBOARD.

493
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,145
HE DID EXACTLY
WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE.

494
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,689
I WON'T
UNDERESTIMATE HIM AGAIN.

495
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,650
NOW, FIRE BLIND.
LAY DOWN A PATTERN.

496
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,111
TRAVERSE PATTERN.
ALL PHASERS FIRE!

00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,071
PHASER ONE, FIRE.

498
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,282
PHASER ONE, FIRE.

499
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,005
PHASER TWO, FIRE!

500
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,756
PHASER TWO, FIRE.

501
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:20,282
DIVERT ALL POWER
TO WEAPONS.

502
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,501
PHASER OVERLOAD.

503
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,419
CONTROL CIRCUIT
BURNOUT.

504
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,889
IT'LL TAKE TIME
TO CORRECT, SIR.

505
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,308
CAPTAIN, ARE THEY
SURRENDERING?

506
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:54,858
FULL ASTERN!

507
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,694
EMERGENCY WARP SPEED!

508
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,201
DO WE HAVE
EMERGENCY WARP?

509
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,579
FULL POWER, SIR.
IT'S STILL
OVERTAKING US.

510
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:18,131
IF WE CAN GET
ONE PHASER
WORKING, SIR,

511
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,175
ONE SHOT WOULD
DETONATE IT.

512
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,468
NAVIGATION?

513
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,763
ESTIMATE IT'LL OVERTAKE US
IN TWO MINUTES, SIR.

514
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,352
PHASERS, MR. SPOCK?

515
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,562
IMPOSSIBLE, CAPTAIN.

516
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,235
FEED THIS
TO THE SPACE RECORDER

517
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,362
AND JETTISON IMMEDIATELY.

518
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,990
CAPTAIN, SHOULD
I CONTINUE LOG ENTRY--

519
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,200
YEOMAN...

520
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,956
AFFIRMATIVE.
CONTINUE LOG ENTRIES.

521
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,874
YES, SIR.

522
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,502
10 SECONDS
TO IMPACT.

523
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,258
CAPTAIN...

524
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,260
IT'S DISSIPATING,
SIR.

525
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,096
[STILES]
IT MUST HAVE
A RANGE LIMIT.

526
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,935
5...

527
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,479
4...

528
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,481

529
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:16,649
2...

530
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:17,650
1...

531
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:18,567
IMPACT!

532
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,909
LIMITED RANGE.

533
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,964
PHASERS OPERATIONAL,
CAPTAIN.

534
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:48,305
INTRUDER BEARING
111 MARK 14.

535
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,432
BACK TO
HIS OLD COURSE.

536
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,768
HE MAY THINK WE'RE
DESTROYED, CAPTAIN.

537
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,603
I WOULDN'T MAKE
THAT ASSUMPTION.

538
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:58,231
I DON'T THINK THEIR CAPTAIN
WILL, EITHER.

539
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:03,028
INTRUDER HOLDING STEADY,
COURSE 111 MARK 14.

540
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,370
SAME AS BEFORE,
MR. SULU.

541
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,543
STAY WITH HIM.

542
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,516
COMMANDER,
THE REFLECTION RETURNS.

543
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,559
ACTIVATE OUR CLOAK.

544
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,602
COMMANDER,
OUR FUEL RUNS LOW.
QUICKLY!

545
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,067
THE EARTH VESSEL?
IMPOSSIBLE.

546
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,695
IT MOVES AS WE MOVE.

547
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:50,450
ITS COMMANDER IS NOT ONE
TO REPEAT A MISTAKE.

548
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,381
WE'LL ENTER THE NEUTRAL ZONE
IN ONE MINUTE, CAPTAIN.

549
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,884
DO WE VIOLATE
THE TREATY, CAPTAIN?

550
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,427
THEY DID, DOCTOR.

551
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,430
ONCE INSIDE, THEY
CAN CLAIM WE DID.
A SETUP.

552
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,348
THEY WANT WAR,
WE FURNISH
THE PROVOCATION.

553
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,975
WE'RE STILL ON
OUR SIDE, CAPTAIN.

554
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,478
LET'S GET THEM
WHILE WE ARE--

555
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,898
BEFORE WE ENTER
THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

556
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,691
FULL AHEAD, MR. SULU.
MAXIMUM WARP.

557
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,151
AHEAD, SIR.
MAXIMUM.

558
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,445
PHASERS, STAND BY.

559
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,529
SIR, AT THIS DISTANCE?

560
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,451
WE KNOW
THEIR ACHILLES HEEL,
MR. STILES.

561
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,453
THEIR WEAPON TAKES
ALL THEIR ENERGY.

562
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,246
THEY MUST BECOME VISIBLE
IN ORDER TO LAUNCH IT.

563
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,164
A PHASER HIT
AT THIS DISTANCE

564
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,917
WOULD BE THE WILDEST
STROKE OF LUCK.

565
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,086
I'M AWARE OF THAT,
MR. STILES.
ARE PHASERS READY?

566
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,671
PHASERS SHOW READY, SIR.

567
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,007
COMMANDER!

568
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,009
EVASIVE ACTION.

569
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,304
THE EARTH SHIP AGAIN.

570
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,116
20 SECONDS
TO NEUTRAL ZONE, SIR.

571
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,285
LIEUTENANT UHURA,

572
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,913
INFORM COMMAND BASE...

573
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,917
IN MY OPINION,
NO OPTION.

574
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,545
ON MY RESPONSIBILITY,

575
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,925
WE ARE PROCEEDING
INTO THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

576
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,598
STEADY AS WE GO, MR. SULU.
CONTINUE FIRING.

577
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,609
COMMANDER, THEY STAY
WITHIN RANGE!

578
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,364
I WILL TEND
TO THE CENTURION.

579
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:53,782
NO NEED.

580
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,492
CENTURION IS DEAD.

581
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,203
WHY DON'T WE FIRE,
COMMANDER?

582
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,082
NO.

583
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,672
NO, HE'S SHREWD,
THIS STARSHIP COMMANDER.

584
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,675
HE TRIES TO MAKE US
WASTE ENERGY.

585
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,303
HE HAS ESTIMATED
WE HAVE ONLY ENOUGH...

586
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,062
IT IS TIME.

587
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,439
ALL DEBRIS INTO
DISPOSAL TUBES.

588
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,274
YES, COMMANDER.

589
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,696
THE BODY
OF THE CENTURION, TOO.

590
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,788
FORGIVE ME,
MY OLD FRIEND,

591
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,917
BUT I MUST USE
ALL MY EXPERIENCE NOW

592
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,627
TO GET HOME.

593
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,428
MOTION SENSOR
SIGNAL STOPPED.

594
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:57,846
CEASE FIRE.

595
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:00,223
DEBRIS SCATTER
AHEAD, SIR.
WE'VE HIT HIM.

596
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,433
MR. SPOCK?

597
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,519
VESSEL WRECKAGE--
METAL MOLDS, CONDUIT,

598
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,272
PLASTAFORM,
AND A BODY, CAPTAIN.

599
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,607
HOWEVER...

600
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:11,902
HOWEVER?

601
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,361
INSUFFICIENT MASS, SIR.

602
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,988
WHAT?

603
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,656
SIMPLE DEBRIS.

604
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:17,783
NOT A VESSEL,

605
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,200
A TRICK.

606
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,827
GO TO SENSOR PROBES.

607
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,245
NOTHING, SIR.

608
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,706
NO MOTION
OUT THERE AT ALL.

609
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,001
WE'VE LOST THEM,
CAPTAIN.

610
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:43,349
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 1709.6.

611
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,435
WE ARE AT THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

612
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,854
HAVE LOST CONTACT
WITH THE INTRUDER.

613
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,815
NO REACTION
ON OUR MOTION SENSORS,

614
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,818
BUT BELIEVE THE ROMULAN VESSEL
TO BE SOMEWHERE CLOSE BY

615
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,779
WITH ALL ENGINES AND SYSTEMS
SHUT DOWN.

616
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,280
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> IS ALSO PLAYING

617
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,324
THE SILENT WAITING GAME

618
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,868
IN HOPE OF REGAINING CONTACT.

619
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:05,789
CAPTAIN, I MUST MAKE
FURTHER REPAIRS
ON THE TRANSFER COIL.

620
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,415
IT'S GIVING OUT AGAIN.

621
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,584
ALL RIGHT, MR. SPOCK.
WORK QUIETLY.

622
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,513
[SOFTLY]
NOW 20 FULL CYCLES,
COMMANDER.

623
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,264
STILL NO SIGN.

624
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,227
I SAY HE'S BEEN FOOLED.

625
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,229
HE MUST HAVE GONE ON.
SHH!

626
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,858
HE IS THERE,
SOMEWHERE.

627
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,276
I FEEL IT.

628
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,612
CAPTAIN'S LOG, SUPPLEMENTAL.

629
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:41,700
NOW MOTIONLESS
FOR 9 HOURS, 47 MINUTES.

630
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,795
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING
FROM THE GALLEY, SIR?

631
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,632
COFFEE, AT LEAST?

632
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,342
THANK YOU, YEOMAN.

633
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,721
BRING IT TO THE BRIDGE.
I'LL BE THERE IN A MOMENT.

634
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,139
YES, SIR.

635
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,737
I WISH I WERE ON
A LONG SEA VOYAGE SOMEWHERE.

636
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:22,615
NOT TOO MUCH DECK TENNIS,
NO FRANTIC DANCING,

637
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,077
AND NO RESPONSIBILITY.

638
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,871
WHY ME?

639
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,250
I LOOK AROUND
THAT BRIDGE,

640
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:37,047
AND I SEE THE MEN WAITING
FOR ME TO MAKE THE NEXT MOVE.

641
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,798
AND, BONES...

642
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,552
WHAT IF I'M WRONG?

643
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,473
CAPTAIN--

644
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,060
NO, I DON'T REALLY
EXPECT AN ANSWER.

645
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,645
BUT I'VE GOT ONE.

646
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:56,649
SOMETHING
I SELDOM SAY TO A...

647
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,236
CUSTOMER, JIM.

648
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,738
IN THIS GALAXY,

649
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,699
THERE'S A MATHEMATICAL
PROBABILITY

650
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,286
OF 3 MILLION
EARTH-TYPE PLANETS...

651
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,081
AND IN ALL
THE UNIVERSE,

652
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:15,543
3 MILLION MILLION
GALAXIES LIKE THIS.

653
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,713
AND IN ALL OF THAT,

654
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,340
AND PERHAPS MORE,

655
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,594
ONLY ONE OF EACH OF US.

656
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,308
DON'T DESTROY
THE ONE NAMED KIRK.

657
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,096
[ALARM SOUNDS]

658
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,681
WHAT--
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

659
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,853
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

660
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,604
A SIGNAL,
COMMANDER.

661
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,777
WE HAVE HIM.

662
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,821
MOVE TOWARD HIM.

663
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,828
POWER ON.

664
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,042
REVERSE COURSE.
HE'LL TRY TO SLIP
UNDER US.

665
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,877
LATERAL POWER, SIR.

666
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,170
COMING AROUND, SIR.

667
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,131
PHASERS, FIRE.

668
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,133
PHASERS, FIRE.

669
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,233
HOW, COMMANDER? HOW?

670
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,401
HE'S A SORCERER,
THAT ONE.

671
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,529
HE READS THE THOUGHTS
IN MY BRAIN.

672
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,575
OUR FUEL SUPPLY
ALL BUT GONE,

673
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,994
AND HE STAYS
OUT OF REACH.

674
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,704
WE ARE BEATEN.

675
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,455
CAN IT BE TRUE?

676
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,834
THE PRAETOR'S
FINEST AND PROUDEST
FLAGSHIP BEATEN!

677
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,090
PERHAPS WE CAN
YET SAVE

678
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,342
YOUR PRAETOR'S PRIDE
FOR HIM.

679
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,802
MORE DEBRIS
INTO THE TUBES!

680
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,680
DECIUS, DO WE HAVE
SOME OF THE OLD-STYLE
NUCLEAR WARHEADS ABOARD?

681
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,308
YES, COMMANDER, BUT ONLY
FOR SELF-DESTRUCTION.

682
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,018
PLACE ONE IN
WITH THE DEBRIS.

683
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,895
PROXIMITY FUSE.

684
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,563
YES, COMMANDER,
AT ONCE.

685
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:47,237
MORE WRECKAGE,
SIR, SCATTERING
ACROSS OUR PATH.

686
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,405
CEASE FIRE.

687
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,822
DEBRIS ON OUR SCANNERS.

688
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,116
ANALYSIS, QUICKLY.

689
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,700
SAME TYPE
AS BEFORE, SIR,

690
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,744
EXCEPT...

691
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,372
ONE METAL-CASED OBJECT.

692
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,624
HELM, HARD OVER!
PHASERS, FIRE POINT-BLANK!

693
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,334
PHASERS, FIRE!

694
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,183
GLORIOUS.
GLORIOUS!

695
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:23,148
NOW WE GO HOME.

696
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,777
THEY'RE AT OUR MERCY.

697
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,529
COMMANDER...

698
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,783
I REMIND YOU
OF YOUR DUTY.

699
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,666
CAPTAIN TO SICK BAY.

700
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,042
<i>McCOY HERE.</i>
CASUALTIES?

701
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,545
<i>22, SO FAR.</i>
<i>MAINLY RADIATION BURNS,</i>

702
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,048
<i>MOSTLY FROM THE SHIP'S</i>
<i>OUTER AREAS.</i>

703
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,967
<i>COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH,</i>
<i>MUCH WORSE, CAPTAIN.</i>

704
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,136
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

705
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,891
REPORT, MR. SPOCK?

706
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,602
NUCLEAR DEVICE
OF SOME KIND, SIR.

707
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,897
OUR PHASERS DETONATED IT
LESS THAN 100 METERS AWAY.

708
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,483
SHIP DAMAGE?

709
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,734
MAINLY OVERLOADS
AND CIRCUIT BURNOUTS.

710
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,486
WEAPONS STATUS?

711
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,113
<i>WE'VE ONLY THE FORWARD</i>
<i>PHASER ROOM.</i>

712
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,823
FULLY OPERABLE, SCOTTY?

713
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,783
<i>YES, SIR,</i>
<i>BUT SPECIALIST TOMLINSON</i>
<i>IS MANNING IT ALONE.</i>

714
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,494
<i>NO STANDBY CREW</i>
<i>AVAILABLE.</i>

715
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,038
SIR, MY FIRST ASSIGNMENT
WAS IN WEAPONS CONTROL.

716
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,498
GO.

717
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,708
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
TAKE OVER NAVIGATION.

718
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,543
YES, CAPTAIN.

719
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,016
WE HAVE ENGINE POWER
NOW, CAPTAIN,

720
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,894
IF YOU'D LIKE TO MOVE OFF
AND MAKE REPAIRS.
NO, NO.

721
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,522
MAYBE WE CAN
PULL THEM BACK

722
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,024
TO OUR SIDE
OF THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

723
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,902
HOLD OUR POSITION.

724
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,112
PLAY DEAD.

725
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,204
STILL NO SIGN
OF MOVEMENT, COMMANDER.

726
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,081
WE HAVE DAMAGED
OURSELVES.

727
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,958
OUR FUEL RESERVE
IS GONE.

728
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,422
AND IT IS OUR DUTY
TO CRUSH

729
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:12,882
THE PRAETOR'S
ENEMIES.

730
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,510
I DO NOT TRUST
THEIR CAPTAIN.

731
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,929
WE ARE IN
THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

732
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,139
THEY WILL NOT ENTER.

733
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,602
IF YOU REFUSE,

734
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:28,106
PERMIT ME THE GLORY
OF THE KILL, COMMANDER.

735
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,821
WE WILL ATTACK...

736
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,241
BUT ON<i> MY</i> ORDER.

737
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,922
DAMAGE REPORTS,
MR. STILES?

738
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,424
NEGATIVE.

739
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,968
WILL YOU REQUIRE
ANY ASSISTANCE HERE?

740
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,558
THIS TIME,
WE'LL HANDLE THINGS
WITHOUT YOUR HELP, VULCAN.

741
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,822
TOMLINSON!

742
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,126
ENEMY VESSEL
BECOMING VISIBLE, SIR.

743
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:33,671
FORWARD PHASERS, STAND BY.

744
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,093
FIRE!

745
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,679
FIRE!

746
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,933
STILES, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
FIRE!

747
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,477
<i>FIRE!</i>

748
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:51,022
<i>STILES, CAN YOU HEAR ME?</i>
<i>FIRE!</i>

749
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,398
<i>FIRE!</i>

750
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:56,194
<i>STILES, CAN YOU HEAR ME?</i>
<i>FIRE!</i>

751
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,071
<i>STILES!</i>

752
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,840
WEAPONS!

753
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,480
MR. SULU,
PREPARE TO MOVE IN
ON THE ROMULAN VESSEL.

754
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,440
SHIP-TO-SHIP,
UHURA.

755
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,651
PUT THIS
ON THE SCREEN.

756
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,528
HAILING FREQUENCIES
OPEN, SIR.

757
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,759
CAPTAIN...

758
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,179
STANDING BY TO BEAM
YOUR SURVIVORS ABOARD OUR SHIP.

759
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,557
PREPARE TO ABANDON
YOUR VESSEL.

760
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,102
<i>NO.</i>

761
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:14,188
<i>NO. IT IS NOT OUR WAY.</i>

762
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:20,945
<i>I REGRET THAT WE MEET</i>
<i>IN THIS WAY.</i>

763
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,574
<i>YOU AND I ARE OF A KIND.</i>

764
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,867
<i>IN A DIFFERENT REALITY,</i>

765
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,954
<i>I COULD HAVE</i>
<i>CALLED YOU FRIEND.</i>

766
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,374
WHAT PURPOSE WILL IT
SERVE TO DIE?

767
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,961
<i>WE ARE CREATURES OF DUTY,</i>
<i>CAPTAIN.</i>

768
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:40,797
<i>I HAVE LIVED MY LIFE BY IT.</i>

769
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:47,388
<i>JUST ONE MORE DUTY</i>
<i>TO PERFORM.</i>

770
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,500
YOU ALL RIGHT,
MR. SPOCK?

771
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,376
YES, VERY WELL.
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

772
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,295
AND YOU, MR. STILES?
I'M ALIVE, SIR,

773
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,046
BUT I WOULDN'T BE.

774
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:24,049
MR. SPOCK, HE PULLED ME OUT
OF THE PHASER ROOM.

775
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,511
HE SAVED MY LIFE.

776
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,513
HE RISKED HIS LIFE,
AND AFTER I--

777
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,473
I SAVED
A TRAINED NAVIGATOR

778
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:32,475
SO THAT HE COULD
RETURN TO DUTY.

779
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,311
I AM CAPABLE OF NO OTHER
FEELINGS IN SUCH MATTERS.

780
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:39,064
HOW MANY MEN
DID WE LOSE, BONES?

781
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,441
ONLY ONE...

782
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,776
TOMLINSON,

783
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,945
THE BOY WHO WAS
GOING TO GET MARRIED
THIS MORNING.

784
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,448
HIS FIANCEE'S
AT THE CHAPEL NOW.

785
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:55,039
WE FINALLY RECEIVED
AN ANSWER FROM
COMMAND BASE, SIR.

786
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:59,084
THEY SAY THEY'LL SUPPORT
WHATEVER DECISION
YOU HAVE TO MAKE.

787
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,047
IT NEVER MAKES
ANY SENSE.

788
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:51,303
YOU BOTH HAVE TO KNOW
THAT THERE<i> WAS</i> A REASON.

789
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,604
I'M ALL RIGHT.
