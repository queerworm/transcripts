00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,851
WHAT'S SO FASCINATING?

180
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,728
AN IDENTIFICATION TAPE
FROM OUR SHIP'S LIBRARY

181
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,649
ON DR. SIMON VAN GELDER.

182
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,359
DR. VAN GELDER?

183
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,818
DR. VAN GELDER,
CAPTAIN.

184
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,320
NO MISTAKE.

185
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,155
THERE'S A FULL
I.D. TAPE ON HIM.

186
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,366
COMMITTED TO
TANTALUS COLONY WHEN?

187
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,784
ASSIGNED THERE,
SIX MONTHS AGO,

188
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,287
AS DR. ADAMS'
ASSOCIATE.

189
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:51,044
SHIP TO SURFACE,
TANTALUS COLONY.

190
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,671
Uhura:
HAILING FREQUENCY'S
OPEN, SIR.

191
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,088
<i>U.S.S. ENTERPRISE</i>
TO TANTALUS COLONY.

192
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,674
Woman:
TANTALUS.

193
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,424
THIS IS CAPTAIN KIRK.

194
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,593
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO DR. ADAMS.

195
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,928
STAND BY,
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>

196
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,264
CAPTAIN KIRK,
DR. ADAMS HERE.

197
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,267
DR. ADAMS, REGARDING
YOUR ESCAPED MAN--

198
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,311
IS DR. VAN GELDER
ALL RIGHT?

199
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,564
AND YOUR PEOPLE--
NO INJURIES?

200
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,191
NO CASUALTIES, SIR.

201
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,152
THIS MAN IS...

202
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,405
DR. SIMON VAN GELDER?

203
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,614
YES, OF COURSE.

204
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,281
YOU'RE CERTAIN
HE'S ALL RIGHT?

205
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,367
WE'VE BEEN
VERY CONCERNED.

206
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,868
IN THE VIOLENT STATE
HE'S IN--

207
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,827
NO HARM TO HIM, SIR.

208
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,206
WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
ENLIGHTEN US
AS TO HIS CONDITION.

209
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,375
HE'D BEEN DOING
SOME EXPERIMENTAL WORK,
CAPTAIN,

210
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,793
AN EXPERIMENTAL BEAM
WE'D HOPED

211
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,255
MIGHT REHABILITATE
INCORRIGIBLES.

212
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,382
VAN GELDER FELT HE
HADN'T THE MORAL RIGHT

213
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,092
TO EXPOSE ANOTHER MAN
TO SOMETHING

214
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,010
HE HADN'T TRIED
ON HIS OWN PERSON.

215
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,220
TRAGEDY, DOCTOR.

216
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,055
JIM...

217
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,434
THAT DOESN'T
QUITE RING TRUE.

218
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,231
UH, DR. ADAMS...

219
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,566
PLEASE STAND BY.

220
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,401
EXPLAIN.

221
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,071
I DON'T BELIEVE HIM.

222
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,156
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT,

223
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,700
BUT THE MORE
I STUDY THAT PATIENT--

224
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,827
YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM
AND YOU CAN'T
EXPLAIN IT.

225
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,955
BONES, ARE YOU AWARE
THAT IN THE LAST
20 YEARS,

226
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,167
DR. ADAMS HAS DONE MORE
TO REVOLUTIONIZE,
TO HUMANIZE PRISONS

227
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,753
AND THE TREATMENT
OF PRISONERS

228
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,339
THAN ALL THE REST
OF HUMANITY HAD DONE
IN 40 CENTURIES?

229
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,550
I'VE BEEN TO
THOSE PENAL COLONIES

230
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,761
SINCE THEY'VE BEGUN
FOLLOWING HIS METHODS.

231
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,011
AND THEY'RE
NOT CAGES ANYMORE.

232
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,888
McCoy:
JIM...

233
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,142
THEY'RE CLEAN,
DECENT HOSPITALS
FOR SICK MINDS.

234
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:29,892
JIM, LISTEN.

235
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,436
GENTLEMEN...

236
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,354
I SUGGEST
YOU ASK DR. ADAMS

237
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,649
IF HE WANTS
VAN GELDER RETURNED.

238
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,243
DR. ADAMS...

239
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,621
REGARDING VAN GELDER...

240
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,164
YES, CAPTAIN.

241
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,792
MAY I INQUIRE
ABOUT YOUR PATROL
DESTINATIONS?

242
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,043
ARE YOU PASSING NEAR
ANY HOSPITAL FACILITIES

243
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,836
SUPERIOR TO OURS?

244
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,673
I'D LIKE VAN GELDER
TO HAVE

245
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,716
THE BEST POSSIBLE
TREATMENT, OF COURSE.

246
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,176
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

247
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,303
I'LL TAKE IT UP
WITH THE SHIP'S SURGEON.

248
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,639
STAND BY.

249
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,515
WELL, BONES,
YOU'VE GOT THE BALL.

250
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,685
YOU CARE TO RECOMMEND
A BETTER PLACE?

251
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,227
THERE ARE
NO SUPERIOR FACILITIES.

252
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,771
HE KNOWS THAT.

253
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,314
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE QUESTION.

254
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,107
IF SOMETHING UNUSUAL
IS GOING ON DOWN THERE...

255
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,693
AN ASSUMPTION,
DOCTOR.

256
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,612
I'M REQUIRED TO ENTER
ANY REASONABLE DOUBTS

257
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,197
INTO MY MEDICAL LOG.

258
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,492
THAT REQUIRES YOU
TO ANSWER IN YOUR LOG.

259
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,039
SORRY, JIM.

260
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,340
DR. ADAMS...

261
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,926
THIS IS
RATHER EMBARRASSING.

262
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,512
BY STRICT INTERPRETATION

263
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,848
OF OUR STARSHIP
REGULATION,

264
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,267
I'M REQUIRED TO INITIATE
AN INVESTIGATION OF THIS

265
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,977
SO THAT A PROPER REPORT--

266
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,605
NO NEED
TO APOLOGIZE,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

267
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,483
IN FACT, I'D TAKE IT
AS A PERSONAL FAVOR

268
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,194
IF YOU'D BEAM DOWN AND
LOOK INTO IT YOURSELF.

269
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,904
I'M SURE YOU REALIZE

270
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,240
WE DON'T GET
TOO MANY VISITORS HERE.

271
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,324
OH, I, UH...

272
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,159
CAPTAIN, I WOULD
APPRECIATE IT

273
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,037
IF YOU COULD COME DOWN
WITH A MINIMUM STAFF.

274
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,164
WE'RE FORCED TO LIMIT
OUTSIDE CONTACT

275
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,082
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

276
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,667
AFFIRMATIVE, DOCTOR.

277
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,085
I'VE VISITED
REHAB COLONIES BEFORE.

278
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,546
<i>ENTERPRISE</i> OUT.

279
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,424
FIND ME SOMEONE
IN YOUR DEPARTMENT

280
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,802
WITH PSYCHIATRIC AND
PENOLOGY EXPERIENCE,

281
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,387
IF POSSIBLE.

282
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,766
YES, SIR.

283
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,491
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 2715.2.

284
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,870
STANDARD ORBIT.
PLANET TANTALUS 5.

285
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,956
MISSION--ROUTINE
INVESTIGATION AND REPORT

286
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,166
AS PER SHIP SURGEON'S
MEDICAL LOG.

287
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,753
AS FOR MY LAST ENTRY,

288
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,882
IT SEEMS I WILL GET TO MEET
DR. ADAMS AT LAST.

289
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,343
HOWEVER,
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.

290
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,597
SICK BAY.

291
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,725
REPORT, DOCTOR.

292
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,355
VAN GELDER'S STILL
VIOLENTLY AGITATED,
CAPTAIN.

293
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,899
AND YOU'D PREFER
TO KEEP HIM HERE

294
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,317
UNTIL I COMPLETE
MY INVESTIGATION,
ANYWAY.

295
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,860
I BELIEVE
WE SHOULD, JIM.

296
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,572
OH, I'M ASSIGNING YOU
A TECHNICAL AIDE, CAPTAIN.

297
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,324
ONE OF OUR PSYCHIATRISTS
DOES HAVE A BACKGROUND

298
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,701
IN REHABILITATIVE
THERAPY.

299
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:34,577
DR. NOEL,

300
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,288
STANDING BY IN
THE TRANSPORTER ROOM NOW.

301
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,706
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
BRIDGE OUT.

302
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,541
MR. SPOCK.

303
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,426
COORDINATES.

304
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,554
LOCKED IN, SIR.
READY TO BEAM DOWN.

305
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,231
DR. HELEN NOEL,
CAPTAIN.

306
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,609
WE'VE MET.

307
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,376
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

308
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,294
THE SCIENCE LAB
CHRISTMAS PARTY?

309
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,671
YES, I REMEMBER.

310
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,964
YOU DROPPED IN--

311
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,507
YES, YES,
I REMEMBER.

312
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,926
PROBLEM, CAPTAIN?

313
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,019
MR. SPOCK,

314
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,478
YOU TELL McCOY THAT
SHE'D BETTER CHECK OUT

315
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,105
AS THE BEST ASSISTANT
I EVER HAD.

316
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,907
ENERGIZE.

317
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,784
ENERGIZE.

318
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,346
IN HERE I PRESUME,
DOCTOR.

319
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,306
PERHAPS
IT WOULD BE SIMPLER

320
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,516
IF YOU CALLED ME
HELEN, CAPTAIN, SINCE--

321
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,643
THIS IS ANOTHER TIME,
ANOTHER PLACE,

322
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,896
AND ANOTHER SITUATION.

323
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,398
WELL, OF COURSE,
CAPTAIN.

324
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,278
ELEVATOR...

325
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,865
AND GOING DOWN
QUITE A WAYS.

326
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,076
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT
FOR WEAK HEARTS.

327
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,130
HELLO, CAPTAIN KIRK...

328
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,465
AND, UH...

329
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,967
DR. HELEN NOEL.

330
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,218
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU, SIR.

331
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,470
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

332
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,472
WELCOME TO
DEVIL'S ISLAND, DOCTOR.

333
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,933
PERHAPS YOU'LL
CALL ME HELEN, DOCTOR.

334
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,434
WITH SO
MANY TITLES AROUND,

335
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,311
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE SURE
WHO'S TALKING TO WHO.

336
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,896
I SHALL INDEED.
WON'T YOU?

337
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,773
THANK YOU.

338
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,650
I BELIEVE
REGULATIONS CALL FOR ME
TO CHECK MY WEAPON.

339
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,360
OH, NO,
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY
IN YOUR CASE, CAPTAIN.

340
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,695
JUST KEEP IT
OUT OF SIGHT.

341
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,949
I KNOW YOU PEOPLE FEEL
AS NAKED WITHOUT A WEAPON

342
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,785
AS WE DO WITHOUT
A MEDIKIT.

343
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,620
[BOTH LAUGH]

344
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,664
A SMALL TOAST.
DO YOU MIND?

345
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,083
IT'S SUCH A GREAT DAY
FOR US HERE ON TANTALUS

346
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,459
WHEN WE HAVE VISITORS,

347
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,669
NO MATTER
WHAT THE EXCUSE.

348
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,253
DOCTOR...

349
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,464
OH, NOW, CAPTAIN,
YOU MADE YOUR APOLOGY
FROM UPSTAIRS.

350
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,882
NOW FORGET IT.

351
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,676
I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL BE ABLE

352
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,095
TO GET THROUGH
THE SECURITY SCREEN,
CAPTAIN.

353
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,014
JUST A SECOND.

354
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,974
THERE. NOW TRY IT.

355
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,976
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>
COME IN.

356
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,644
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>
SPOCK HERE.

357
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,147
YOUR LANDING COORDINATES
WERE RIGHT ON THE NOSE,
MR. SPOCK.

358
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,690
WE ARRIVED SAFELY,

359
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,859
AND WE'RE HERE WITH
DR. ADAMS RIGHT NOW.

360
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,527
KIRK OUT.

361
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,904
AFFIRMATIVE, CAPTAIN.
<i>ENTERPRISE</i> OUT.

362
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,074
AH, LETHE...

363
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,575
COME IN.

364
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,578
LETHE...
THIS IS CAPTAIN KIRK

365
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,580
AND DR. HELEN NOEL.

366
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,583
LETHE CAME TO US
FOR REHABILITATION

367
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,794
AND STAYED ON
AS A THERAPIST,

368
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,462
AND A VERY GOOD ONE,
TOO, I MIGHT ADD.

369
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,506
I LOVE MY WORK.

370
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,053
GO RIGHT AHEAD,
CAPTAIN.

371
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,055
BEFORE YOU CAME HERE...

372
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,098
I WAS ANOTHER PERSON--

373
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,475
MALIGNANT, HATEFUL.

374
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,228
MAY I ASK WHAT CRIME
YOU COMMITTED?

375
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,980
DOES IT MATTER?

376
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,774
THAT PERSON
NO LONGER EXISTS.

377
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,194
UH, PART OF OUR CURE,

378
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,112
IF YOU WILL, CAPTAIN,

379
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,822
IS TO BURY THE PAST.

380
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,199
WHY SHOULD A PERSON

381
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,700
GO ON LIVING
WITH UNBEARABLE MEMORIES

382
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,785
IF THERE'S NO NECESS--

383
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,414
WELL, I FEEL QUITE SURE
THAT YOU'D CONCUR WITH
ME IN THAT, DOCTOR--

384
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,999
HELEN.

385
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,625
A SHIFTING
OF MEMORY PATTERNS

386
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,627
IS BASIC
TO PSYCHOTHERAPY.

387
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,591
YES. AND NOW
TO THE TOAST, HMM?

388
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,426
YOU'LL FORGIVE US,
LETHE.

389
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,762
THERE YOU ARE,
CAPTAIN.

390
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,891
TO ALL MANKIND...

391
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,936
MAY WE NEVER
FIND SPACE SO VAST,

392
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,521
PLANETS SO COLD,

393
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,523
HEART AND MIND
SO EMPTY

394
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,859
THAT WE CANNOT
FILL THEM

395
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,737
WITH LOVE
AND WARMTH.

396
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,418
QUITE A TOUR, DOCTOR.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

397
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,920
THANK YOU.

398
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,172
HI, CARL.

399
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,093
DOCTOR...

400
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,928
YES?

401
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,097
HMM?

402
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,640
AH...

403
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,976
I WAS AFRAID
YOU WOULD ASK ABOUT
THIS, CAPTAIN.

404
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,644
ONE DOESN'T LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT

405
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,562
THEIR
PERSONAL FAILURES,
YOU KNOW.

406
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,065
IT WAS JUST
AN EXPERIMENT THAT
WENT WRONG, I'M AFRAID.

407
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,733
MAY I SEE IT?

408
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,443
CAPTAIN,
IF SOMETHING
HASN'T WORKED OUT

409
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,861
AND, THEREFORE, HAS
NO SCIENTIFIC FACT--

410
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,905
SHALL WE LEAVE IT
UP TO THE DOCTOR?

411
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,949
SINCE YOU BROUGHT ME
DOWN HERE FOR
ADVICE, CAPTAIN--

412
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,118
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES
OF BEING A CAPTAIN, DOCTOR,

413
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,744
IS BEING ABLE
TO ASK FOR ADVICE

414
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,578
WITHOUT NECESSARILY
HAVING TO TAKE IT.

415
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,956
I THINK I'LL HAVE
TO AWARD THAT ROUND

416
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,249
TO THE CAPTAIN, HELEN.

417
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,834
YOU'RE FIGHTING
OVER YOUR WEIGHT.

418
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,753
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

419
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,884
I'M NOT A CRIMINAL!

420
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,263
I DO NOT REQUIRE...

421
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:32,101
NEURAL NEUTRALIZER.

422
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:38,191
NEURAL NEUTRALIZER.

423
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,526
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT,
DR. VAN GELDER?

424
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,238
A ROOM...

425
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,241
A DEVICE.

426
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,036
DOOR...

427
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,662
CONTROL PANEL.

428
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,041
I SEE IT.

429
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,417
A DEVICE...

430
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,795
A LIGHT!

431
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,880
THE LIGHT!

432
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:01,881
THIS ROOM...

433
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,590
WHAT HAPPENS THERE?

434
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,678
AAH!

435
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,430
AAH!

436
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,059
AAH!

437
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,270
AAH...

438
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,028
A NEURAL
NEUTRALIZER--

439
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,529
EXPERIMENTAL.

440
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,446
ACTUALLY,
WE DON'T EXPECT

441
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,991
TO GET MUCH USE
OUT OF IT AT ALL.

442
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,784
THAT BEAM FROM ABOVE

443
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,995
NEUTRALIZES
BRAIN WAVES.

444
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,621
IT RELAXES
THE PATIENT AS WELL.

445
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,998
IT DOES THEM
NO HARM, OF COURSE,

446
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,125
AND THE EFFECTS
ARE ONLY TEMPORARY.

447
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,877
ONE QUESTION,
DOCTOR.

448
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,587
IF IT DOESN'T
DO ANY GOOD...

449
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:44,048
WHY DO WE GO ON
USING IT, HMM,
CAPTAIN?

450
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,091
HOPE.

451
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:47,634
YES. YES,
THERE'S ALWAYS
THAT SLIGHT CHANCE

452
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,636
THAT IT MIGHT DO
SOME GOOD

453
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,638
IN THE MORE
VIOLENT CASES.

454
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,225
TRANQUILIZERS
ARE FINE, CAPTAIN,

455
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,184
BUT TO CONTINUALLY
PUMP CHEMICALS

456
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,810
INTO A PERSON'S BLOOD--

457
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,021
EXACTLY MY POINT,
HELEN. YES.

458
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,564
SHALL WE?

459
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,405
HOW DOES IT WORK?

460
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,031
QUITE SIMPLE.

461
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,741
OFF/ON SWITCHES...

462
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,120
AND THE LARGE CONTROL HERE
CHANGES THE STRENGTH

463
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,454
OF THE BRAIN
NEUTRALIZING BEAM.

464
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,457
CAPTAIN...

465
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,336
YOU REMIND ME
OF THE ANCIENT SKEPTIC

466
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,922
WHO DEMANDED
OF THE WISE OLD SAGE

467
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,258
TO BE TAUGHT
ALL THE WORLD'S WISDOM

468
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,802
WHILE STANDING
ON ONE FOOT.

469
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,637
BEAM NEUTRALIZING
HAS BEEN
EXPERIMENTED WITH

470
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,513
ON EARTH, CAPTAIN.

471
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,016
I'M NOT ACQUAINTED
WITH THIS PARTICULAR
STYLE OF EQUIPMENT,

472
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:39,312
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT DR. ADAMS
HAS NOT CREATED

473
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:40,520
A CHAMBER OF
HORRORS HERE.

474
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,190
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
SUGGEST THAT HE HAD.

475
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,525
THE REASON I ASKED, SIR,
WAS YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED

476
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,820
WHERE DR. VAN GELDER'S
INJURY OCCURRED.

477
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,322
RIGHT HERE, CAPTAIN.

478
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,990
YES.

479
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,617
SIMON WAS
A VERY STUBBORN MAN.

480
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,121
HE COULD HAVE SAT
IN THAT ROOM FOR YEARS

481
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,539
WITH THE BEAM
AT THAT VOLUME,
OR EVEN HIGHER,

482
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,043
OR IF HE SIMPLY HAD
SOMEONE STANDING BY

483
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,921
TO SNAP IT OFF IN CASE
HE GOT INTO TROUBLE, BUT...

484
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:10,343
NO. HE TRIED IT ALONE
AND ON FULL VOLUME.

485
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,887
IT'S A PITY.

486
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,480
THANK YOU.

487
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,070
YOU WILL FORGET

488
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,655
ALL YOU HAVE HEARD.

489
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,907
TO REMEMBER
ANY PORTION OF IT,

490
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,533
ANY WORD,

491
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,495
WILL CAUSE YOU PAIN,

492
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,830
TERRIBLE PAIN...

493
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,415
GROWING MORE TERRIBLE

494
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,292
AS YOU FIGHT
TO REMEMBER.

495
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,136
CAN YOU GIVE US
YOUR PRESENT LOCATION,
CAPTAIN?

496
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,930
IN DR. ADAMS' STUDY,
MR. SPOCK. WHY?

497
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,851
THEN YOU'RE WITH
DR. ADAMS NOW.

498
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,061
AFFIRMATIVE.

499
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,484
CAPTAIN...

500
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,486
VAN GELDER
HAS MADE REFERENCE

501
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,905
TO A PARTICULAR
TREATMENT ROOM.

502
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,782
THE TERM WAS
NEURAL NEUTRALIZER.

503
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,826
YES. HE WAS INJURED THERE.
I'VE SEEN THE ROOM.

504
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,662
DR. ADAMS
EXPLAINED THE MISTAKE
VAN GELDER MADE.

505
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:26,377
GO AHEAD, MR. SPOCK.
ANYTHING FURTHER?

506
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,341
YOUR MR. SPOCK SOUNDS
LIKE A VERY EXCELLENT

507
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,510
SECOND IN COMMAND,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

508
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,762
PLEASE TELL HIM TO GO AHEAD
AND SPEAK FREELY.

509
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:39,557
I HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH
A MEMBER OF MY STAFF ANYWAY.

510
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,974
THANK YOU,
DR. ADAMS.

511
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,684
EXCUSE ME.

512
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,978
STAND BY,
MR. SPOCK.

513
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:51,318
DR. ADAMS HAS LEFT
WITH SOME THINGS
TO ATTEND TO.

514
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:52,903
WHAT IS IT,
MR. SPOCK?

515
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,406
VAN GELDER IS EXTREMELY
AGITATED, CAPTAIN,

516
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,032
AND WARNS THAT
YOU ARE IN DANGER.

517
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,200
WELL, THAT'S FOOLISH.

518
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,993
UH, PLEASE REPEAT,
CAPTAIN.

519
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,745
I DIDN'T RECEIVE THAT.

520
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,290
TELL McCOY
THE TECHNICAL EXPERT
HE SENT ALONG WITH ME

521
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,167
INSISTS THAT
ANY CONCERN IS...

522
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,168
UNJUSTIFIED.

523
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,753
ACCORDING TO ADAMS,

524
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,714
VAN GELDER CREATED
HIS OWN PROBLEM.

525
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,425
HE'S SUFFERING FROM

526
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,468
NEURAL SYNAPSE DAMAGE,

527
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,886
AS IF HIS BRAIN
WERE SHORT-CIRCUITED.

528
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,514
IT'S NO WONDER
HE'S HAVING DELUSIONS.

529
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,724
McCOY HERE.
RECEIVED AND UNDERSTOOD.

530
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,352
BUT WE STILL HAVE
SOME DOUBTS UP HERE,
CAPTAIN.

531
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,563
CAN YOU TELL US
ANY MORE?

532
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,523
NOT REALLY.

533
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:33,068
WHEN DO YOU PLAN
TO BEAM BACK UP, CAPTAIN?

534
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,194
I...

535
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,530
THINK WE'LL SPEND
THE NIGHT HERE,
MR. SPOCK.

536
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,532
NO! NO.

537
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,700
NO. NO.

538
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:45,164
AND YOU WILL CONTINUE
TO CHECK IN
EVERY 4 HOURS?

539
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:45,956
AFFIRMATIVE.

540
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,916
KIRK OUT.

541
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,126
NO! NO.

542
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,295
NO, DON'T LET THEM!

543
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,712
YOU MUST WARN
YOUR CAPTAIN.

544
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,507
NO! NO!

545
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:55,924
DON'T LET HIM STAY!

546
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:56,967
DON'T LET HIM STAY!

547
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,969
DON'T! NO. NO.

548
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,220
DON'T HYPO ME.

549
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,556
PLEASE,
DON'T HYPO ME.

550
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,684
I'LL TRY NOT TO FIGHT.

551
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,187
I'LL TRY.

552
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,606
BUT YOU MUST LISTEN.

553
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,693
WARN YOUR CAPTAIN.
DR. ADAMS...

554
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,114
D--

555
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,492
DR. ADAMS...

556
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,203
WILL DESTROY...

557
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,371
DESTROY HOW?

558
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:26,830
WHAT?

559
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,752
RIGHT...

560
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,296
DEATH.

<i>ENTERPRISE</i> LOG.

562
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,150
FIRST OFFICER SPOCK,
ACTING CAPTAIN.

563
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,653
I MUST NOW USE
AN ANCIENT VULCAN TECHNIQUE

564
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,780
TO PROBE INTO
VAN GELDER'S TORTURED MIND.

565
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,782
SPOCK, IF THERE'S
THE SLIGHTEST
POSSIBILITY

566
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,284
IT MIGHT HELP--

567
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,827
I'VE NEVER USED IT
ON A HUMAN, DOCTOR.

568
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,247
IF THERE'S ANY WAY
WE CAN LOOK
INTO THIS MAN'S MIND

569
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,873
TO SEE IF
WHAT HE'S SEEING IS
REAL OR DELUSION--

570
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:14,378
IT'S A HIDDEN,
PERSONAL THING TO
THE VULCAN PEOPLE,

571
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,422
PART OF
OUR PRIVATE LIVES.

572
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:17,423
NOW, LOOK, SPOCK,

573
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,426
JIM KIRK COULD BE
IN REAL TROUBLE.

574
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,761
WILL IT WORK OR NOT?

575
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,485
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

576
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,779
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

577
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,198
IT REQUIRES
I MAKE PRESSURE CHANGES...

578
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,575
IN YOUR NERVES,

579
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,660
YOUR BLOOD VESSELS.

580
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,120
YOU MUST...

581
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,247
OPEN MY MIND.

582
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,624
LET ME WARN YOU

583
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,459
AND EXPLAIN TO YOU.

584
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,421
THIS WILL NOT
AFFECT YOU,
DR. McCOY.

585
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,673
ONLY THE PERSON
I TOUCH.

586
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,300
IT IS NOT HYPNOSIS.

587
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,593
I UNDERSTAND.

588
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,786
GOOD.
THE READING'S LEVELING.

589
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,458
YOU BEGIN TO FEEL
A STRANGE EUPHORIA.

590
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,636
YOUR BODY...

591
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,387
FLOATS.

592
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,641
YES.

593
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,270
I BEGIN TO FEEL IT.

594
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,063
OPEN YOUR MIND.

595
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,776
WE MOVE TOGETHER.

596
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,029
OUR MINDS...

597
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:07,032
SHARING
THE SAME THOUGHTS.

598
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,867
[DOOR BUZZER]

599
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,288
GOOD EVENING.

600
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,457
GOOD EVENING.

601
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,459
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE INMATES

602
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,085
WE SAW HERE
THIS AFTERNOON?

603
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,505
YOU COULD'VE WAITED
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING
TO ASK ME THAT, CAPTAIN.

604
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,465
I DIDN'T.

605
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,883
I THOUGHT
THEY WERE HAPPY,

606
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,092
WELL-ADJUSTED.

607
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,636
BUT A BIT BLANK.

608
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,055
CAPTAIN, IF YOU'RE
QUESTIONING THE METHODS

609
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,264
OF A MAN LIKE
TRISTAN ADAMS--

610
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,891
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THAT TREATMENT ROOM
AGAIN.

611
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,560
YOU SAY YOU'RE
SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR

612
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:35,977
WITH THE THEORY
BEHIND IT?

613
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,104
YES, SOMEWHAT.

614
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,106
BUT IF YOU'D SIMPLY STATE
ANY DOUBTS YOU HAVE
TO DR. ADAMS--

615
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,316
AND IF HE'S LYING,
HE'LL CONTINUE TO LIE

616
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,360
AND I WON'T FIND OUT
A THING.

617
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,944
THE ONLY WAY
I CAN BE SURE IS TO SEE
THAT MACHINE AT WORK.

618
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,154
OR IS THAT
TOO IMPRACTICAL

619
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,491
AND UNSCIENTIFIC OF ME,
DOCTOR?

620
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,582
WELL?

621
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,124
COMING.

622
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,796
WHAT IS OUR NAME?

623
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,759
WHO ARE WE?

624
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,723
WE ARE SIMON VAN GELDER.

625
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,225
DR. ADAMS...

626
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,603
THE NEURAL NEUTRALIZER.

627
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,066
WHAT DID HE DO TO US?

628
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,947
HE CAN RESHAPE ANY MIND
HE CHOOSES.

629
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:34,494
HE USED IT
TO ERASE OUR MEMORIES,

630
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,247
PUT HIS OWN THOUGHTS
THERE.

631
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,336
HE WAS SURPRISED
IT TOOK SO MUCH POWER.

632
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,173
WE FOUGHT HIM,
REMEMBER?

633
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,554
BUT WE GREW SO TIRED.

634
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,392
OUR MINDS SO BLANK...

635
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,227
SO OPEN...

636
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,438
THAT ANY THOUGHT
HE PLACED THERE

637
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,190
BECAME OUR THOUGHTS.

638
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,820
OUR MINDS SO EMPTY...

639
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,613
LIKE A SPONGE

640
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,865
NEEDING THOUGHTS,

641
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,450
BEGGING.

642
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,786
EMPTY.

643
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,414
LONELINESS.

644
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:23,001
SO LONELY TO BE
SITTING THERE EMPTY...

645
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,965
WANTING
ANY WORD FROM HIM.

646
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,259
LOVE.

647
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,636
YES.

648
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:33,720
HATE.

649
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,430
YES.

650
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,599
LIVE.

651
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,767
YES.

652
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:39,768
DIE.

653
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:40,936
YES.

654
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,481
SUCH AGONY

655
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,775
TO BE EMPTY.

656
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,194
EMPTY.

657
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,779
LONELY.

658
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:52,739
LONELY.

659
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,783
SO EMPTY.

660
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,494
EMPTY.

661
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,330
SO EMPTY.

662
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,043
I HAVE NO DESIRE
TO DAMAGE MY BRAIN.

663
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,672
CAN THIS BE HANDLED
WITH REASONABLE SAFETY,
YES OR NO?

664
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,298
YES.

665
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,591
AND WILL YOU
BE ABLE TO DETERMINE

666
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,636
IF THAT BEAM IS HARMING ME
IN THE SLIGHTEST?

667
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,304
YES, CAPTAIN.

668
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,598
I KNOW
MY PROFESSION.

669
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:33,906
READY?

670
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,114
MM-HMM.

671
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,616
WE'LL TRY
MINIMUM INTENSITY--

672
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,451
A SECOND OR TWO.

673
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,337
ANYTIME YOU'RE READY,
DOCTOR.

674
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,338
JUST FOR
A SECOND OR TWO.

675
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:54,092
WE ALREADY TRIED IT
FOR THAT LONG, CAPTAIN.

676
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,677
NOTHING HAPPENED.

677
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,554
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

678
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,890
YOUR FACE WENT
COMPLETELY BLANK.

679
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,060
TRY A...

680
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,937
HARMLESS SUGGESTION.

681
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,695
YOU'RE HUNGRY.

682
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:17,657
YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE FINALLY
GET THROUGH THIS,

683
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:21,620
I'D LIKE TO LOCATE
AND RAID A KITCHEN
SOMEWHERE.

684
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,457
I PUT THAT SUGGESTION
IN YOUR MIND, CAPTAIN.

685
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:29,044
I SAID SIMPLY
THAT YOU WERE HUNGRY.

686
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,548
REMARKABLY EFFECTIVE
FOR A DEVICE

687
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:37,385
THAT DR. ADAMS
WAS GOING TO ABANDON.

688
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,388
I THINK WE SHOULD
TRY THIS AGAIN.

689
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,099
YES.
PICK SOMETHING UNUSUAL,

690
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,475
AN UNUSUAL SUGGESTION.

691
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,643
SOMETHING WE CAN
BOTH BE SURE OF.

692
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,193
AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY...

693
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,822
WE MET.

694
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,074
WE DANCED.

695
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,618
YOU TALKED
ABOUT THE STARS.

696
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,079
I SUGGEST NOW
THAT IT HAPPENED

697
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,081
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

698
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,291
YOU SWEPT ME
OFF MY FEET

699
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,544
AND CARRIED ME
TO YOUR CABIN.

700
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,631
[LAUGHING]

701
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,425
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

702
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,096
CAPTAIN,
IF YOUR CREW SAW YOU
CARRY ME HERE...

703
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,140
MY CREW...

704
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,558
IS SWORN
TO SECRECY.

705
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,812
BUT MY REPUTATION...

706
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,313
I MEAN,

707
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,524
JUST HAVING
MET LIKE THIS.

708
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,359
OF COURSE,

709
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,654
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
IF YOU CARED FOR ME.

710
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,702
YOU WANT ME
TO MANUFACTURE A LIE,

711
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,328
WRAP IT UP AS A...

712
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,789
CHRISTMAS PRESENT
FOR YOU?

713
