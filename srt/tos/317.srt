1
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,847
A GHOST PLANET?

2
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:15,850
I SUGGEST NO
SUPERNATURAL
EXPLANATION, CAPTAIN.

3
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,226
I MERELY POINT OUT
THAT THE FACTS
DO NOT FIT

4
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,145
ANY KNOWN CATEGORIES
OF PLANETS.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,856
LET'S TAKE THE FACTS
ONE BY ONE.

6
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,065
THAT SHOULD EXPLAIN
SOMETHING.
UNDOUBTEDLY.

7
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,194
THE AGE OF THIS PLANET
WOULD SEEM TO BE ONLY
A FEW THOUSAND YEARS.

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,281
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR VEGETATION TO EVOLVE
IN SO SHORT A PERIOD.

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,242
ITS SIZE IS
APPROXIMATELY THAT
OF EARTH'S MOON.

10
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:38,455
BUT ITS MASS
AND ITS ATMOSPHERE
ARE SIMILAR TO EARTH.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,499
THAT WOULD BE
DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN.

12
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,084
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE,
CAPTAIN.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,338
AN ATMOSPHERE COULD NOT
EVOLVE IN SO SHORT
A PERIOD OF TIME.

14
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,674
AND YET IT HAS.
EVIDENTLY.

15
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,093
BUT THE INCONSISTENCIES
ARE SO COMPOUNDED
AS TO PRESENT

16
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,221
A SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE
PHENOMENON.

17
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,723
BUT A FASCINATING ONE,
MR. SPOCK.

18
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,099
PRECISELY, CAPTAIN.

19
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,394
IT WOULD BEAR
CLOSER INVESTIGATION,
IT WOULD SEEM,

20
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,229
IF WE'RE TO PROVIDE
STARFLEET WITH
AN ACCURATE REPORT.

21
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,105
LIEUTENANT,
SEND DR. McCOY

22
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,066
TO THE TRANSPORTER ROOM
FOR SURVEY PARTY.

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,652
WE'LL ALSO NEED SENIOR
GEOLOGIST D'AMATO.
AYE, AYE, SIR.

24
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,612
FEED BEAMDOWN
COORDINATES TO
THE TRANSPORTER ROOM.

25
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,698
MR. SULU,
YOU'LL ACCOMPANY ME.

26
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,951
MR. SPOCK,
YOU HAVE THE CON.

27
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:22,666
LIEUTENANT RADHA,
REPORT TO THE BRIDGE
IMMEDIATELY.

28
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,837
THIS EXPEDITION SHOULD
BE A GEOLOGIST'S DREAM,
MR. D'AMATO.

29
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,715
WELL, THE OPPORTUNITY
TO EXPLORE SO YOUNG
A PLANET

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,341
IS AN INCREDIBLE BIT
OF LUCK, CAPTAIN.

31
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,260
YES. IF MR. SPOCK
IS CORRECT, YOU'LL
HAVE A REPORT

32
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,596
TO STARTLE
THE FIFTH INTERSTELLAR
GEOPHYSICAL CONFERENCE.

33
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,096
WHY? WHAT IS IT, JIM?

34
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,140
A PLANET EVEN SPOCK
CAN'T EXPLAIN.

35
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,185
PREPARE TO TRANSPORT.

36
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,902
ENERGIZE.

37
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,530
WAIT! YOU MUST NOT GO!

38
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,344
JIM, DID YOU SEE
WHAT I SAW?

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,307
THAT WOMAN ATTACKED
ENSIGN WYATT. KIRK TO--
CAPTAIN. CAPTAIN!

40
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,953
MR. SPOCK!

41
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,537
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YES.

42
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,039
I BELIEVE
NO PERMANENT DAMAGE
WAS DONE.

43
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,582
WHAT HAPPENED?

44
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,584
THE OCCIPITAL AREA
OF MY HEAD SEEMS

45
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,504
TO HAVE IMPACTED WITH
THE ARM OF THE CHAIR.

46
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,881
NO, MR. SPOCK. I MEANT
WHAT HAPPENED TO US?

47
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,758
THAT WE HAVE YET
TO ASCERTAIN.

48
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,678
MR. SPOCK.
THE PLANET'S GONE!

49
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,641
WHAT KIND OF
EARTHQUAKES DO THEY
HAVE IN THIS PLACE?

50
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,810
I DON'T KNOW. ANY MORE
LIKE THAT, IT'LL TEAR
THIS PLANET APART.

51
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,186
CAPTAIN?

52
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,815
THIS TREMOR WE FELT,
IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS--

53
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,109
AND IT'S CERTAINLY
LIKE NO SEISMIC
DISTURBANCE

54
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,653
I'VE EVER FELT BEFORE--

55
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,572
I GOT A READING OF
ALMOST IMMEASURABLE
POWER.

56
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,866
BUT IT'S NOT THERE
ANYMORE.

57
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,077
COULD SEISMIC STRESS
HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR IT?

58
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:27,332
THE READING I GOT
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE SEISMIC FORCE.

59
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,168
THAT'S VERY STRANGE.
AND THAT WOMAN?

60
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,545
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

61
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,255
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>
COME IN.

62
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,051
HMM. SHOCK MAY HAVE
DAMAGED IT.

63
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,927
IT'S GONE!

64
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,972
THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>
IT'S GONE!

65
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,976
HE'S RIGHT, CAPTAIN.
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

66
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,645
HOW COULD IT JUST BE GONE?
WHAT THE DEVIL DOES THAT
MEAN, JIM?

67
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,189
FOR ONE THING...

68
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,817
IT MEANS
WE'RE STRANDED.

69
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,126
<i>SPACE--</i>
<i>THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

70
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,552
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE.

71
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,512
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

72
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,681
<i>TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>STRANGE NEW WORLDS...</i>

73
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,810
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...</i>

74
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,898
<i>TO BOLDLY GO WHERE</i>
<i>NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.</i>

75
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,857
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
MUST HAVE BLOWN UP.

76
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,734
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
THE HIGH RADIATION
READINGS,

77
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,861
WOULDN'T IT,
CAPTAIN, IF THE
MATTER/ANTIMATTER--

78
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,239
SHALL WE STOP GUESSING,
MR. SULU, AND TRY AND
ESTABLISH A PATTERN?

79
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,783
I GET NO READINGS
OF HIGH ENERGY
CONCENTRATION.

80
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,868
IF THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
HAD BLOWN UP,

81
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,954
IT WOULD HAVE LEFT
A HIGH RESIDUAL
RADIATION.

82
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,373
COULD IT BE
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> HIT US,
HIT THE PLANET?

83
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,376
ONCE IN SIBERIA,
THERE WAS A METEOR
SO GREAT

84
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,671
THAT IT FLATTENED
WHOLE FORESTS AND
WAS FELT AS FAR--

85
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,756
MR. SULU, IF I'D
WANTED A RUSSIAN
HISTORY LESSON,

86
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,842
I'D HAVE BROUGHT ALONG
MR. CHEKOV.

87
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,094
THIS IS A MATTER
OF SURVIVAL, GENTLEMEN.

88
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,222
WITHOUT THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>
WE NEED FOOD

89
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,433
AND WE NEED WATER
AND WE NEED THEM FAST.

90
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,936
I WANT A DETAILED ANALYSIS
MADE OF THIS PLANET
AND I WANT IT NOW.

91
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,353
AYE, SIR.

92
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,522
YES, SIR.

93
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,525
MR. SULU.

94
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,824
ENGINEERING, NO DAMAGE.
ALL POWER LEVELS NORMAL.

95
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,450
DAMAGE CONTROL
REPORT.

96
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,827
SHIP FUNCTIONING
NORMALLY.

97
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,453
MANY BUMPS
AND BRUISES.

98
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,455
ONE CASUALTY,
MR. SPOCK.

99
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,748
THE TRANSPORTER
OFFICER.

100
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,250
HE'S DEAD.

101
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,002
DEAD?

102
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,378
SPOCK TO SICK BAY.

103
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,048
SICK BAY.
DOCTOR M'BENGA.

104
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,883
REPORT ON THE DEATH
OF THE TRANSPORTER
OFFICER.

105
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,509
WELL, WE'RE NOT SURE.

106
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,137
DR. SANCHEZ
IS CONDUCTING
AN AUTOPSY RIGHT NOW.

107
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,722
HMM.

108
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,141
GIVE ME A FULL REPORT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, PLEASE.

109
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,143
SPOCK OUT.

110
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,644
MR. SCOTT...

111
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,522
HAVE THE TRANSPORTER
CHECKED FOR POSSIBLE
MALFUNCTION.

112
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,690
AYE, SIR.

113
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,608
NO DEBRIS
OF ANY KIND, SIR.

114
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,527
I'VE MADE
TWO FULL SCANS.

115
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,655
IF THE PLANET HAD
BROKEN UP, THERE'D
BE SOME SIGN.

116
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,491
BUT WHAT BOTHERS ME
IS THE STARS,
MR. SPOCK.

117
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,951
THE STARS.

118
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,871
YES, SIR.
THEY'RE WRONG.

119
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,623
WRONG?
YES, MR. SPOCK.

120
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,458
LOOK.

121
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,962
NOW HERE'S A REPLAY
OF THE STAR PATTERN

122
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,757
JUST BEFORE
THE EXPLOSION.

123
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,051
HMM.

124
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,928
A POSITIONAL CHANGE.

125
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,930
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

126
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,515
BUT SOMEHOW I'D SAY
THAT IN A FLASH,

127
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,017
WE'VE BEEN KNOCKED
1,000 LIGHT YEARS

128
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,102
AWAY FROM
WHERE WE WERE.

129
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,021
990.7 LIGHT YEARS

130
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,480
TO BE EXACT,
LIEUTENANT.

131
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,982
BUT THAT'S NOT
POSSIBLE.

132
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,609
NOTHING
CAN DO THAT.

133
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,611
MR. SCOTT,
SINCE WE ARE HERE,

134
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,988
YOUR STATEMENT
IS NOT ONLY ILLOGICAL

135
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,616
BUT ALSO UNWORTHY
OF REFUTATION.

136
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,118
IT IS ALSO ILLOGICAL
TO ASSUME

137
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,660
THAT ANY EXPLOSION,

138
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,205
EVEN THAT OF A SMALL STAR
GOING SUPERNOVA,

139
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,126
COULD HAVE HURLED US
A DISTANCE OF 990.7
LIGHT YEARS.

140
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,212
BUT THE POINT IS
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE
HURLED US ANYWHERE!

141
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,006
WHY, IT SHOULD HAVE
DESTROYED US IMMEDIATELY,
VAPORIZED US!

142
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,633
THAT IS CORRECT,
MR. SCOTT,

143
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,009
BY ALL THE LAWS
THAT WE KNOW.

144
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,219
THERE WAS NO PERIOD
OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS.

145
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,347
OUR SHIP'S CHRONOMETERS
REGISTERED A MATTER
OF ONLY A FEW SECONDS.

146
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,933
THEREFORE, WE WERE
DISPLACED THROUGH SPACE

147
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,560
IN SOME MANNER
WHICH I AM UNABLE
TO FATHOM.

148
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,813
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS THAT THE PLANET
DIDN'T BLOW UP

149
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,357
AND THE CAPTAIN
AND THE OTHERS,
THEY'RE STILL ALIVE!

150
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,402
PLEASE, MR. SCOTT,
RESTRAIN YOUR LEAPS
OF ILLOGIC.

151
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,821
I HAVE SAID NOTHING.
I WAS MERELY SPECULATING.

152
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,906
[BEEP]

153
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:10,991
SICK BAY
TO MR. SPOCK.

154
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,826
SPOCK HERE.

155
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,953
YOU ASKED FOR
AN AUTOPSY REPORT.

156
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,456
IT'S ONLY PRELIMINARY,
BUT THE CAUSE OF DEATH

157
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,125
SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
CELLULAR DISRUPTION.

158
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,793
EXPLAIN.

159
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,295
WELL, IT'S AS THOUGH
EVERY CELL IN THE BODY

160
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,672
HAD BEEN INDIVIDUALLY
BLASTED FROM INSIDE.

161
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,342
WOULD ANY KNOWN
DISEASE ORGANISM
DO THAT?

162
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,718
DR. SANCHEZ HAS RULED
THAT POSSIBILITY OUT, SIR.

163
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,139
PLEASE KEEP ME
FULLY ADVISED.
SPOCK OUT.

164
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,724
HE WAS IN
THE TRANSPORTER ROOM.

165
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:42,147
SOMEONE MAY HAVE ENTERED
AFTER CAPTAIN KIRK
AND HIS PARTY LEFT.

166
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,648
MR. SCOTT,

167
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,733
SINCE THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
IS OBVIOUSLY FUNCTIONAL,

168
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,819
I SUGGEST WE RETURN
TO OUR STARTING PLACE

169
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,946
AT TOP WARP SPEED.
AYE, SIR.

170
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,907
BUT EVEN AT THAT,
IT'LL TAKE US A
WHILE TO GET THERE.

171
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,534
IN THAT CASE,
MR. SCOTT,

172
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,536
I SUGGEST
WE START AT ONCE.

173
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,745
CAN YOU GIVE ME
WARP 8?

174
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,623
AYE, SIR. AND MAYBE
A WEE BIT MORE.

175
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,127
I'LL SIT ON THE
WARP ENGINES MYSELF
AND NURSE THEM.

176
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,713
THAT POSITION,
MR. SCOTT,

177
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,132
WOULD NOT ONLY BE
UNAVAILING,

178
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:13,011
BUT ALSO...UNDIGNIFIED.

179
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,890
LIEUTENANT RADHA,
PLOT A COURSE.

180
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,517
ALREADY PLOTTED
AND LAID IN, SIR.

181
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,101
GOOD.

182
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,270
THEN PREPARE TO COME
TO WARP 8.

183
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,023
YOUR REPORT COVERS
ALL VEGETATION?

184
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,566
YES, CAPTAIN.

185
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,486
ALL VEGETATION
IS INEDIBLE,
POISON TO US.

186
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,612
IF THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
HAS BEEN DESTROYED,

187
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,032
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
WE CAN SURVIVE?

188
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,950
YES.

189
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,702
I DON'T SEE ANY WATER,

190
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,704
BUT THERE MUST BE SOME
TO GROW THE VEGETATION.

191
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,582
A SOURCE OF WATER
WOULD STRETCH
OUR SURVIVAL.

192
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,502
DID YOU SEE
ANY EVIDENCE
OF RAINFALL?

193
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,628
NO, SIR. AND I HAVEN'T
SEEN ANY EVIDENCE

194
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,963
THAT THERE EVER HAS
BEEN ANY RAINFALL.

195
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,007
BUT THERE
IS EARTH-TYPE
VEGETATION.

196
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,633
IS IT POSSIBLE
THE VEGETATION COULD

197
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,511
ABSORB THE WATER
DIRECTLY FROM THE AIR?

198
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,137
YES,
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

199
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,014
THERE'S ALSO
THE POSSIBILITY OF
UNDERGROUND WATER.

200
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,516
YES, SIR.
IT COULD BE.

201
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,600
WELL, SULU'S PICKED UP
AN ORGANISM

202
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,478
THAT'S ALMOST A VIRUS,
LIKE A PLANT PARASITE,

203
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,606
AND IT'S THE NEAREST
BIOLOGICAL FORM OF LIFE
THAT I CAN FIND.

204
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,192
THIS APPARENTLY IS GOING
TO BE OUR HOME FOR
AS LONG AS WE LAST.

205
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,445
I SUGGEST WE FIND OUT
AS MUCH AS WE CAN
ABOUT IT.

206
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,196
WE'LL SPLIT UP.
D'AMATO,

207
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,655
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
UNDERGROUND WATER.
YES, SIR.

208
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,617
SULU, RUN AN ATMOSPHERIC
ANALYSIS.
AYE, SIR.

209
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,620
BONES, SEE IF YOU CAN
FIND OUT ANYTHING

210
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,582
ABOUT THE VEGETATION
AND YOUR PARASITE.

211
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,584
HOW DO THEY GET
THEIR MOISTURE?

212
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,002
IF YOU CAN DISCOVER
HOW THEY SURVIVE,

213
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,130
MAYBE WE CAN.

214
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,645
SULU TO CAPTAIN.

215
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,397
KIRK HERE.

216
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,024
CAPTAIN, I WAS MAKING
A STANDARD MAGNETIC
SWEEP.

217
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,194
FROM ZERO,
I SUDDENLY GOT A READING
THAT WAS OFF THE SCALE,

218
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,614
THEN A REVERSE
OF POLARITY, AND...

219
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,698
NOW I GET NOTHING.

220
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,826
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS READING...

221
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,829
LIKE...A DOOR OPENED

222
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,623
AND THEN CLOSED AGAIN.

223
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,919
KIRK OUT.

224
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,559
DO NOT BE AFRAID.

225
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,852
I'M NOT.

226
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,312
GEOLOGICAL DISTURBANCES
DON'T FRIGHTEN ME.

227
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,105
I'VE COME HERE
TO STUDY THEM.

228
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,440
MY SPECIALTY.

229
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,568
I KNOW.

230
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,110
YOU ARE LIEUTENANT
D'AMATO,

231
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,572
SENIOR GEOLOGIST.

232
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,989
THAT'S RIGHT.
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

233
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,617
FROM THE SPACE SHIP
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>

234
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,078
YES, AND WE'RE
STRANDED HERE.

235
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,955
YOU BEEN TALKING
TO MY FRIENDS?

236
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,710
DO NOT BE AFRAID.

237
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,713
OH, I'M NOT AFRAID.

238
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,592
I AM FOR YOU,
LIEUTENANT D'AMATO.

239
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,178
WHY, YOU'RE--

240
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,514
YOU'RE THE WOMAN
ON THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

241
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,225
I AM ONLY FOR
D'AMATO.

242
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,270
WELL, LUCKY D'AMATO.

243
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,188
I WANT TO HAVE
A CONFERENCE

244
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,772
ABOUT SHARING
YOUR FOOD AND WATER.

245
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,402
DO NOT CALL THE OTHERS...
PLEASE.

246
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,909
McCOY TO KIRK.

247
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,161
KIRK HERE.

248
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,956
JIM, I JUST GOT
A LIFE FORM READING
OF TREMENDOUS INTENSITY.

249
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,958
SUDDENLY IT WAS
JUST THERE.

250
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,585
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
JUST THERE?

251
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,170
JUST THAT.
ALL LEVELS WERE NORMAL,

252
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,799
AND THEN I GET THIS
BIOLOGICAL SURGE OF
LIFE FORM REGISTERING.

253
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,386
NO. NOW IT'S GONE.

254
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,097
AS THOUGH A DOOR
OPENED AND CLOSED.

255
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,098
YES.

256
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,099
WHAT DIRECTION?

257
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,310
WAIT A MINUTE. ZERO...

258
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:32,811
0-8-3.

259
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,188
HANG ON.

260
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,150
D'AMATO SECTION.
COME IN.

261
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,778
KIRK TO D'AMATO.
COME IN.

262
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,696
COME IN!

263
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,365
BONES, SULU,
D'AMATO DOESN'T ANSWER.

264
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,575
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

265
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,463
BONES!

266
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,561
JIM, EVERY CELL
IN HIS BODY'S
BEEN DISRUPTED.

267
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,618
JIM, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

268
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,162
DIGGING A GRAVE.

269
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,288
POOR D'AMATO.

270
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,208
WHAT A TERRIBLE
WAY TO DIE.

271
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,461
THERE ARE
NO GOOD WAYS, SULU.

272
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,729
THAT'S THE SAME
RED ROCK.

273
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,814
MY PHASER DIDN'T
CUT THROUGH IT.

274
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,066
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT HAS A MIGHTY HIGH
MELTING POINT.

275
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,150
8,000 DEGREES
CENTIGRADE.

276
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,193
IT LOOKS LIKE
IGNEOUS ROCK,

277
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,238
BUT INFINITELY
DENSER.

278
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,296
THIS WHOLE PLANET
MUST BE MADE UP
OF THIS SUBSTANCE

279
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,257
COVERED OVER
BY TOPSOIL.

280
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,801
MR. SULU, IT MIGHT
EXPLAIN THIS PLACE

281
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,928
A LITTLE BETTER IF WE KNEW
WHAT THE SUBSTANCE IS.

282
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,681
I KNOW IT WAS
D'AMATO'S FIELD,

283
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,140
BUT SEE WHAT
YOU CAN FIND OUT.

284
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,518
YES, SIR.

285
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,105
WELL, I GUESS
A TOMB OF ROCKS

286
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,649
IS THE BEST
WE CAN PROVIDE
FOR D'AMATO.

287
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,818
YEAH.

288
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,488
IT MIGHT BE
THE MOST SUITABLE
MEMORIAL AT THAT.

289
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,662
I WONDER
WHAT KILLED HIM.

290
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,416
I DON'T KNOW...

291
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,918
BUT SOMETHING OR...

292
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,963
SOMEONE...DID.

293
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,095
WE'RE HOLDING
WARP 8.4, SIR.

294
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,931
IF WE CAN MAINTAIN IT,

295
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,933
OUR ESTIMATED
TIME OF ARRIVAL

296
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,935
IS 11 AND 1/2
SOLAR HOURS.

297
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,938
11.337 HOURS,
LIEUTENANT.

298
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,689
I WISH YOU WOULD BE
MORE PRECISE.

299
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,316
SCOTT TO BRIDGE.

300
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,651
SCOTT TO BRIDGE.

301
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,860
[BEEP]

302
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,153
SPOCK HERE.

303
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,071
MR. SPOCK, THE SHIP
FEELS WRONG.

304
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,032
"FEELS," MR. SCOTT?

305
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,827
I KNOW IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

306
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:37,204
INSTRUMENTATION
READS CORRECT, BUT
THE FEEL IS WRONG!

307
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,457
IT'S SOMETHING
I CAN'T QUITE PUT
INTO WORDS.

308
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,834
THAT IS OBVIOUS,
MR. SCOTT.

309
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,543
I SUGGEST YOU AVOID
EMOTIONALISM

310
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,129
AND SIMPLY KEEP
YOUR INSTRUMENTS
CORRECT.

311
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,965
SPOCK OUT.

312
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,209
IT LOOKS
SO LONELY THERE.

313
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,170
IT WOULD BE WORSE
IF HE HAD COMPANY.

314
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,548
DOCTOR,
HOW CAN YOU
JOKE ABOUT IT?

315
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,800
I'M NOT JOKING.

316
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,927
UNTIL WE KNOW
WHAT KILLED HIM,
NONE OF US IS SAFE.

317
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,013
WE'VE GOT
TO FIGURE THIS OUT

318
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,015
AND DEVISE
A DEFENSE AGAINST IT.

319
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,393
IS IT POSSIBLE
THE ROCKS HAVE LIFE?

320
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,603
YOU REMEMBER
ON JANUS SIX, THE
SILICON CREATURES--

321
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,648
BUT OUR INSTRUMENTS
RECORDED THAT.
THEY WERE LIFE FORMS.

322
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,692
THEY REGISTERED
AS LIFE FORMS.

323
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,777
UNLESS WE'RE DEALING
WITH BEINGS--

324
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,822
INTELLIGENT BEINGS--
WHO CAN SHIELD THEMSELVES.

325
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,198
BEINGS
INTELLIGENT ENOUGH

326
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,616
TO HAVE DESTROYED
THE<i> ENTERPRISE?</i>

327
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,076
THAT'S THE PROBLEM, SULU.

328
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,037
WE HAVE ONLY QUESTIONS....

329
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,039
NO ANSWERS.

330
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,206
WATKINS.

331
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,166
CHECK
THE BYPASS VALVE

332
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,087
ON THE
MATTER/ANTIMATTER
REACTION CHAMBER.

333
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,130
MAKE SURE IT'S NOT
OVERHEATING.

334
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,674
BUT, MR. SCOTT,
THE BOARD SHOWS
CORRECT.

335
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,843
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO CHECK THE BOARD,
LAD.

336
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,678
YES, SIR.

337
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,448
WHO ARE YOU?

338
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,994
MY NAME
IS NOT IMPORTANT.

339
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,495
YOURS IS WATKINS,

340
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,122
JOHN B.

341
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,082
ENGINEER GRADE 4.

342
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,001
YOU KNOW
ALL ABOUT ME.

343
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,086
I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU BEFORE.

344
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,089
SHOW ME THIS UNIT.

345
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,299
I WISH TO LEARN.

346
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,929
WELL, THIS IS
THE MATTER/ANTIMATTER
INTEGRATOR CONTROL.

347
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,098
THAT'S
THE CUTOFF SWITCH.

348
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,850
NOT CORRECT.

349
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,105
THAT IS THE EMERGENCY
OVERLOAD BYPASS,

350
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,066
WHICH ENGAGES
ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY.

351
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,527
A WISE PRECAUTION,

352
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,571
CONSIDERING IT TAKES
THE ANTIMATTER
LONGER TO EXPLODE

353
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:01,909
ONCE THE MAGNETIC
FLOW FAILS.

354
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,749
I AM FOR YOU,
MR. WATKINS.

355
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,878
MR. SCOTT,
THERE'S A STRANGE WOMAN

356
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,921
WHO KNOWS THE ENTIRE PLAN
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

357
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,423
AAH!

358
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,643
OH, YA POOR LAD.

359
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,480
SCOTT TO BRIDGE.
SCOTT TO BRIDGE.

360
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,066
SPOCK HERE.

361
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,651
MY ASSISTANT WATKINS
IS DEAD.

362
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,738
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HE DIED OF,
MR. SCOTT?

363
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,447
I DIDN'T SEE IT
HAPPEN,

364
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,824
BUT HIS LAST WORDS
WERE A WARNING CRY

365
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,576
ABOUT SOME STRANGE
WOMAN.

366
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,453
SECURITY ALERT,
ALL DECKS.

367
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,415
FEMALE INTRUDER.
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

368
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,666
SECURITY ALERT.

369
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,836
ALL DECKS.

370
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,172
CONCLUSIONS.

371
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,798
THE BASIC SUBSTANCE
OF THIS PLANET

372
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,009
IS AN ALLOY
OF DIBURNIUM-OSMIUM.

373
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,095
IT COULDN'T HAVE
EVOLVED NATURALLY.

374
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,763
CAPTAIN, IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

375
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,765
IN FACT, NOTHING
ABOUT THIS PLANET
MAKES SENSE.

376
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,183
EXCEPT FOR
A MOMENTARY
FLUCTUATION

377
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,769
ON YOUR
INSTRUMENTS,

378
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,771
THIS PLANET
HAS NO MAGNETIC
FIELD.

379
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,272
THE APPARENT
AGE OF THESE
ROCKS

380
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,733
IS ONLY A FEW
THOUSAND YEARS.

381
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,735
NO KNOWN PROCESS
COULD EVOLVE
THE PLANT LIFE

382
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,862
THEY HAVE HERE
IN THAT SHORT
SPACE OF TIME.

383
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,782
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THIS MIGHT BE
AN ARTIFICIAL PLANET?

384
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,158
BUT, CAPTAIN, WHERE ARE
THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT?

385
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,244
WHY CAN'T WE SEE THEM?

386
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,121
THE PLANET
MIGHT BE HOLLOW.

387
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,164
THEY MIGHT BE
SHIELDING
THEMSELVES

388
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,958
FROM OUR
SENSOR PROBES.

389
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,293
IT'S DARK.
LET'S GET SOME REST.

390
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,670
TOMORROW WE'LL HAVE
TO FIND SOME FOOD
AND SOME WATER,

391
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,589
OR IT'S GOING
TO BE A VERY
UNPLEASANT STAY.

392
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,966
WHILE IT LASTS.

393
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,592
I'LL TAKE
THE FIRST WATCH, SIR.

394
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,593
ALL RIGHT.

395
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,303
TAKE D'AMATO'S
TRICORDER.

396
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,222
SET IT FOR
AUTOMATIC DISTRESS.

397
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:46,889
YOU NEVER CAN TELL.

398
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,641
AYE, SIR.

399
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,571
[BEEPING]

400
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,002
SPOCK TO SICK BAY.

401
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,795
HAVE YOU
COMPLETED THE AUTOPSY
ON WATKINS, DOCTOR?

402
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,421
YES, WE HAVE,
MR. SPOCK.

403
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,381
WAS THE CAUSE
OF HIS DEATH THE SAME

404
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,884
AS THAT WHICH KILLED
THE TRANSPORTER OFFICER?

405
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,887
WELL, THE PATTERN
OF CELLULAR DISRUPTION
WAS THE SAME.

406
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,724
BUT AS TO THE CAUSE,
WELL, YOUR GUESS IS
AS GOOD AS MINE.

407
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,519
<i>MY</i> GUESS, DOCTOR,

408
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,062
WOULD BE VALUELESS.

409
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:38,149
I SUGGEST WE REFRAIN
FROM GUESSING AND FIND
SOME FACTS.

410
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,358
SPOCK OUT.

411
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,488
THE POWER
OF THIS INTRUDER

412
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,575
TO DISRUPT
EVERY CELL IN A BODY...

413
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,912
COMBINED WITH THE ALMOST
INCONCEIVABLE POWER

414
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,248
REQUIRED TO HURL
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
SUCH A DISTANCE

415
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,375
SPEAK OF
A VERY HIGH CULTURE

416
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,961
AND A VERY GREAT DANGER.

417
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,297
YOU MEAN THAT ONE OF
THE PEOPLE WHO THREW US

418
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,423
1,000 LIGHT YEARS AWAY
FROM THAT PLANET

419
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,135
IS ONBOARD
AND KILLING OUR PEOPLE?

420
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,637
A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION,
MR. SCOTT.

421
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,472
THEN YOU'RE RIGHT,
MR. SPOCK.

422
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,142
WATKINS MUST'VE
BEEN MURDERED.

423
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,602
I SENT HIM IN TO CHECK
THE MATTER/ANTIMATTER
REACTOR.

424
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,563
THERE ARE NO EXPOSED
CIRCUITS THERE.

425
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,524
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ANYTHING HE TOUCHED.

426
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,111
IF THERE ARE MORE
OF THOSE BEINGS
ON THAT PLANET,

427
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:28,782
THE CAPTAIN
AND THE OTHERS ARE
IN VERY GREAT DANGER.

428
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,960
I AM UNARMED.

429
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,171
WHO ARE YOU?

430
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,965
THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT.

431
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,553
YOU ARE LIEUTENANT SULU?

432
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,429
YOU WERE BORN
ON THE PLANET EARTH.

433
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,515
YOU'RE HELMSMAN
FOR THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

434
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,310
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?
WHERE DID YOU GET
THIS INFORMATION?

435
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,728
ARE YOU FROM
THIS PLANET?

436
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,437
I AM FROM HERE.

437
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,439
THEN THE PLANET
<i>IS</i> HOLLOW.

438
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,317
WHO KILLED
LIEUTENANT D'AMATO?

439
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,904
ALL RIGHT.

440
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,240
THE CAPTAIN WILL WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.
THAT WAY.

441
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:11,617
MOVE!

442
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,037
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

443
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,874
I HAVE COME FOR YOU.

444
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,418
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

445
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,338
I WANT...TO TOUCH YOU.

446
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,133
YOU WERE ON
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

447
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,969
KEEP BACK!

448
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,971
STOP
OR I'LL SHOOT!

449
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,974
I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO KILL
A WOMAN!

450
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,570
CAPTAIN KIRK!

451
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,948
CAPTAIN KIRK!

452
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,832
AAH!

453
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,376
HOLD IT!

454
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,337
WHO ARE YOU?

455
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,671
I AM FOR HIM.

456
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,714
I AM FOR
LIEUTENANT SULU.

457
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,133
DON'T LET HER
TOUCH YOU, CAPTAIN!

458
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,677
THAT'S HOW D'AMATO DIED!
PHASERS WON'T STOP HER!

459
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,137
I AM FOR LIEUTENANT SULU.

460
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:16,098
PLEASE, I MUST TOUCH HIM.

461
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,607
HOW CAN YOU
DESTROY OTHERS
AND NOT ME?

462
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,278
I DON'T WANT TO DESTROY.

463
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,904
I DON'T WANT TO.

464
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,406
WHO ARE YOU?

465
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,532
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO KILL US?

466
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,828
ONLY SULU.

467
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,665
I MEAN YOU NO HARM.

468
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,212
ARE THERE MEN
ON THIS PLANET?

469
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,590
PLEASE,
I MUST TOUCH HIM.

470
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:51,717
I AM FOR
LIEUTENANT SULU.

471
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,551
NO!

472
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,606
BONES, DID YOU SEE THAT?

473
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,361
MAYBE SPOCK WAS WRONG.

474
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,531
PERHAPS THIS IS
A GHOST PLANET.

475
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,949
WELL, ALL I KNOW IS THAT
SHE ALMOST MADE A GHOST
OUT OF SULU.

476
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,077
HIS SHOULDER,
WHERE SHE TOUCHED IT,

477
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,871
EVERY CELL'S BEEN
DISRUPTED, EXPLODED
FROM WITHIN.

478
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,456
IF SHE'D REALLY
GOTTEN A GOOD GRIP
ON HIM, JIM--

479
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,583
HOW CAN SUCH PEOPLE BE,
CAPTAIN?

480
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,213
SUCH EVIL...

481
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,672
AND SHE'S SO...

482
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,925
SO BEAUTIFUL.

483
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,802
YES, I KNOW.

484
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,439
SECURITY SWEEPS
OF ALL DECKS ARE
NEGATIVE, MR. SPOCK.

485
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,107
NO EVIDENCE OF INTRUDER.

486
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,402
VERY WELL. CANCEL
RED ALERT, BUT MAINTAIN
INCREASED SECURITY.

487
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,405
AYE, SIR. ALL DECKS,
CANCEL RED ALERT.

488
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,365
MAINTAIN
INCREASED SECURITY.

489
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,368
PLEASE UPDATE
OUR SUBSPACE REPORT
TO STARFLEET

490
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,413
TO INCLUDE
SECURITY SEARCH.
RESULTS NEGATIVE.

491
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,415
HOW DID SHE GET OFF
THE SHIP, SIR?

492
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,917
PRESUMABLY
THE SAME WAY SHE GOT ON.

493
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,378
YES, SIR.

494
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,255
MR. SPOCK...

495
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,257
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
OF THE CAPTAIN

496
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,633
AND THE OTHERS
BEING ALIVE?

497
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,720
LIEUTENANT, WE ARE NOT
ENGAGED IN GAMBLING.

498
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,098
WE ARE PROCEEDING
IN THE ONLY LOGICAL WAY

499
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,350
TO RETURN TO THE PLACE
THEY WERE LAST SEEN

500
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:27,354
AND FACTUALLY ASCERTAIN
WHETHER OR NOT THEY STILL LIVE.

501
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,648
YES, MR. SPOCK.

502
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,945
MR. SPOCK, SPEED IS
INCREASED TO WARP 8.8.

503
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,905
BRIDGE TO ENGINEERING.

504
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,574
SCOTTY HERE.
I SEE IT.

505
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,200
IT'S A POWER SURGE.

506
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,868
I'M WORKING ON IT.

507
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,537
REDUCE SPEED UNTIL I
LOCATE THE TROUBLE.

508
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,332
VERY WELL.
REDUCE SPEED TO WARP 7.

509
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,708
AYE, SIR, WARP 7.

510
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,836
MR. SPOCK...

511
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,670
OUR SPEED
IS INCREASED
TO WARP 8.9

512
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,381
AND STILL CLIMBING.

513
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,550
BRIDGE TO ENGINEERING.

514
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,345
NEGATIVE EFFECT
ON POWER REDUCTION.
SPEED IS STILL INCREASING.

515
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,141
AYE, MR. SPOCK,

516
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,726
AND I FOUND OUT WHY.

517
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,686
THE EMERGENCY
BYPASS CONTROL

518
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,231
OF THE MATTER/
ANTIMATTER
INTEGRATOR IS FUSED.

519
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,816
IT'S COMPLETELY
USELESS.

520
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,485
THE ENGINES
ARE RUNNING WILD.

521
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,529
THERE'S NO WAY
TO GET AT THEM.

522
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,156
WE SHOULD REACH
MAXIMUM OVERLOAD IN
ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

523
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:23,452
I WOULD CALCULATE
14.87 MINUTES, MR. SCOTT.

524
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:27,498
THOSE FEW SECONDS
WILL NOT MAKE ANY
DIFFERENCE, MR. SPOCK,

525
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,083
BECAUSE YOU AND I AND
THE REST OF THE CREW

526
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,710
WILL NO LONGER
BE HERE TO BANDY IT
BACK AND FORTH.

527
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,840
THIS THING IS GOING
TO BLOW UP...

528
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,344
AND THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE UNIVERSE
CAN STOP IT.

529
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:55,359
THERE'S A LAYER
OF NECROTIC TISSUE
A FEW CELLS THICK.

530
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,195
A NORMAL WOUND
WOULD HEAL QUICKLY.

531
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,114
SHE JUST...TOUCHED ME.

532
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,158
HOW COULD IT HAPPEN
SO FAST?

533
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,744
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

534
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,163
SHE TOUCHED
THE TRANSPORTER CHIEF.

535
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,040
HE COLLAPSED IMMEDIATELY.

536
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,125
SHE APPARENTLY GOT
TO D'AMATO.

537
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,252
WE SAW
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

538
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,880
THE QUESTION IS...
WHY ARE YOU ALIVE?

539
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,799
CAPTAIN, I'M HAPPY
THE WAY IT TURNED OUT.

540
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,220
JIM...

541
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,888
WHAT KIND OF POWER
MUST SHE HAVE?

542
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:29,101
THE POWER TO TOTALLY DISRUPT
BIOLOGICAL CELL STRUCTURE.

543
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:32,229
SULU'S ALIVE
BECAUSE I INTERVENED.

544
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,607
BUT THAT RAISES
AN EVEN WORSE QUESTION.

545
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,066
YES.

546
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,445
WHY DIDN'T
SHE KILL YOU?

547
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,490
SHE'S NOT THROUGH YET.

548
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,543
IT'S USELESS.

549
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,045
AND THERE'S NO QUESTION
IT'S DELIBERATE.

550
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,255
SABOTAGE.

551
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,757
AYE, AND A THOROUGH JOB.

552
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,841
THE SYSTEM'S FOOLPROOF.

553
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,553
WHOEVER MURDERED WATKINS
SABOTAGED THIS.

554
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,724
YOU SAID IT WAS FUSED.
HOW?

555
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,143
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WORRIES ME.
WORRIES, MR. SCOTT?

556
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,437
WELL, IT'S FUSED,
ALL RIGHT,

557
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:17,232
BUT IT WOULD TAKE
ALL THE POWER OF OUR
MAIN PHASER BANKS TO DO IT.

558
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,318
INTERESTING.

559
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:22,821
I FIND NOTHING INTERESTING
IN THE FACT THAT WE'RE
ABOUT TO BLOW UP.

560
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:27,200
NO...BUT THE METHOD
IS FASCINATING.

561
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,996
WHATEVER DID THIS
IS STILL ABOARD THIS SHIP.

562
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,792
I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU CANCELED
THE SECURITY ALERT.

563
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:39,254
A FORCE
THAT COULD HURL US
990.7 LIGHT YEARS AWAY

564
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,715
AND AT THAT DISTANCE
STILL BE ABLE

565
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,801
TO SABOTAGE OUR
MAIN SOURCE OF ENERGY

566
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,595
WILL NOT BE
WAITING AROUND TO BE
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

567
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,846
AYE.

568
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,349
AS I RECALL THE PATTERN
OF OUR FUEL FLOW,

569
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,850
THERE IS AN
ACCESS TUBE LEADING

570
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,393
TO THE MATTER/ANTIMATTER
REACTION CHAMBER.

571
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,895
AYE, THERE'S
A SERVICE CRAWLWAY,

572
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,565
BUT IT'S NOT MEANT
TO BE USED WHILE THE
INTEGRATOR OPERATES.

573
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,109
STILL, IT IS THERE,
AND IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE

574
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,111
TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW
OF FUEL AT THAT POINT.

575
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,823
WHAT WITH?
BARE HANDS?

576
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,908
A MAGNETIC PROBE.

577
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,871
ANY MATTER THAT
COMES IN CONTACT
WITH ANTIMATTER

578
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,956
TRIGGERS THE EXPLOSION.

579
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,126
AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE
A MAN CAN LIVE
IN THE CRAWLWAY

580
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,128
IN THE ENERGY STREAM
OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD

581
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,172
THAT BOTTLES UP
THE ANTIMATTER.

582
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,716
I SHALL TRY.

583
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,925
YOU'LL BE KILLED, MAN.

584
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,927
UNLESS A SOLUTION
IS FOUND QUICKLY,

585
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,347
THAT FATE AWAITS
ALL OF US.

586
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,099
AYE. YOU'RE RIGHT.

587
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,227
WHAT HAVE WE GOT
TO LOSE?

588
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:37,270
BUT I'LL DO IT,
MR. SPOCK.

589
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,189
I KNOW
EVERY MILLIMETER
OF THAT SYSTEM.

590
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,316
I'LL DO WHATEVER
HAS TO BE DONE.

591
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,901
VERY WELL, MR. SCOTT.

592
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,404
YOU SPOKE OF THE FEEL
OF THE SHIP BEING WRONG.

593
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,824
AYE. IT WAS
AN EMOTIONAL STATEMENT.

594
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,201
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND IT.

595
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,161
I NOTE IT, MR. SCOTT,

596
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,664
WITHOUT NECESSARILY
UNDERSTANDING IT.

597
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,709
I PROPOSE TO RUN
AN ANALYSIS THROUGH
THE SHIP'S COMPUTERS,

598
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,211
COMPARING
THE PRESENT CONDITION
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

599
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,046
WITH HER IDEAL CONDITION.

600
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,173
MR. SPOCK,
WE DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THAT.

601
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,760
WE HAVE 12 MINUTES
AND 27 SECONDS.

602
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,679
I SUGGEST YOU DO
WHATEVER YOU CAN IN
THE SERVICE CRAWLWAY,

603
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,056
WHILE I MAKE
THE COMPUTER STUDY.

604
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,687
LIEUTENANT SULU,
DO YOU FEEL STRONG
ENOUGH TO MOVE ABOUT?

605
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,063
I FEEL FINE, CAPTAIN.
IS HE, BONES?

606
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,107
HE'S IN FAIR SHAPE.

607
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,692
ALL RIGHT.

608
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,027
WHATEVER DESTRUCTIVE POWER
THIS WOMAN HAS SEEMS

609
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,071
TO BE AIMED AT ONE
SPECIFIC PERSON

610
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,573
AT ONE SPECIFIC TIME.

611
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,533
IF I'M CORRECT,
WHEN SHE REAPPEARS,

612
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,035
THE OTHER TWO MIGHT
BE ABLE TO PROTECT
THE ONE SHE'S AFTER

613
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,037
BY INTERPOSING
THEIR BODIES.

614
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,623
NO WEAPONS SEEM
TO AFFECT HER.

615
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,667
BUT, CAPTAIN, HOW DOES
SHE KNOW ABOUT US?
DOES SHE READ OUR MINDS?

616
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:43,044
[HIGH-PITCHED WHINE]
PHASER ON OVERLOAD!

617
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,924
CONTROLS ARE FUSED.
DROP!

618
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,600
APPARENTLY SHE CAN
DESTROY OUR WEAPONS

619
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,101
AS WELL AS DESTROY US.

620
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,020
COME ON. LET'S GO.

621
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,613
ALL RIGHT, LADS.
GET THE CRAWLWAY DOOR OPEN.

622
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,573
HAND ME THE TOOLS.

623
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,620
COMMUNICATOR.

624
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,747
ALL RIGHT. HEAD FIRST.

625
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:22,459
I HOPE MR. SPOCK KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

626
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,116
SCOTT TO BRIDGE.

627
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,827
[SPOCK]
<i>GO AHEAD, MR. SCOTT.</i>

628
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:00,246
I'VE SEALED OFF
THE AFT END OF THE
SERVICE CRAWLWAY,

629
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,791
AND I'VE POSITIONED
EXPLOSIVE SEPARATOR
CHARGES TO BLAST ME

630
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,335
CLEAR OF THE SHIP
IF I RUPTURE
THE MAGNETIC BOTTLE.

631
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,548
I'M SO CLOSE
TO THE FLOW NOW,

632
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,926
AND IT FEELS
LIKE ANTS CRAWLING
ALL OVER MY BODY.

633
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,762
MR. SCOTT,
I SUGGEST YOU REFRAIN

634
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,764
FROM ANY FURTHER
SUBJECTIVE DESCRIPTIONS.

635
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,391
YOU NOW HAVE 10 MINUTES
AND 19 SECONDS

636
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,727
IN WHICH TO PERFORM
YOUR TASK.

637

<i>MR. SPOCK,</i>

639
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,106
I HEARD THAT.

640
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,026
THE SHIP'S NOT
STRUCTURED TO TAKE
THAT SPEED

641
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,653
FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME.

642
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:37,034
YOU NOW HAVE 10 MINUTES
AND 10 SECONDS.

643
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,209
ALL RIGHT, MR. SPOCK.

644
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:50,088
I'M STARTING TO OPEN
THE ACCESS PANEL NOW,

645
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,424

TO THE FLOW ITSELF.

646
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,843
IF THE MAGNETIC FLOW
JUMPS,

647
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:57,470
YOU MUST JETTISON ME.

648
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,389
THE SAFETY CONTROL

649
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,892

MORE THAN 2 SECONDS

00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,477

00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,479

DANCING ON THE INSTRUMENT.

661
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,071

MR. SCOTT, WHAT IS
YOUR SITUATION?

673
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:28,353
IT'S HARD TO SEE.

674
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,480
THERE'S
SO MUCH DISTURBANCE

THAT ANY ATTEMPT
TO GET AT THE FLOW

676
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,819

00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,621
I DON'T NEED
A BLOOMIN' CUCKOO CLOCK.

681
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:51,250
CAPTAIN,
I'M GETTING THAT STRANGE
MAGNETIC SWEEP AGAIN

682
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,669
FROM ZERO
TO OFF THE SCALE.

683
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,295
YES.

684
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,590

685
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,933

THIS TIME?

686
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,435

689
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,415
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO KILL US?

690
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,000
FOR DEFENSE.

691
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,960
YOU ARE
CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK,

692
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,754
COMMANDER OF

693
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,171
THEN WHY DO YOU WANT
TO KILL ME?

694
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,507
YOU...ARE AN INVADER.

695
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,178
WE'RE HERE ON
A PEACEFUL MISSION.

696
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,262
IT'S YOU WHO HAVE
KILLED OUR PEOPLE.

697
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,264
WE MEAN NO HARM

698
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,141
WE WANT TO LEAVE

699
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,309
CAPTAIN, I'M GETTING
NO LIFE FORM REGISTER.

700
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,770

701
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,564
NO, THAT WOULD GIVE
A MECHANICAL READING.
I'M GETTING NOTHING.

702
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,908

00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,039

706
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,415

707
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,167

708
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,757
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT KILLING ME?

709
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,509
FEEL?

710
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:27,264
KILLING...IS WRONG.

711
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,181
STAY BETWEEN US.

712
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,225
YOU MUST NOT
PENETRATE THIS STATION.

713
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,145
PLEASE.
I MUST TOUCH YOU.

714
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,939
YOU WANT TO KILL ME?

715
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,275
NO.

716
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,652
THEN WHY DO IT
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO?

717
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,947
I AM...SENT.

718
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,825

719
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,704
WE DEFEND THIS PLACE.

00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,166

722
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,174

723
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,055
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN ALONE?

724
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,557
ARE YOU LONELY?

725
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,868
SHE MUST BE SOMEWHERE.

726
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,829
SHE'S NOT
REGISTERING.

727
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,044
AND THERE'S
THIS POWER SURGE,

728
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,880
RIGHT OFF THE SCALE,

729
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:45,884
LIKE A DOOR CLOSING.

730
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,137
IT MUST BE
NEAR HERE.

731
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,641
IS THE POWER LEVEL
STILL HOLDING, JIM?

732
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,809
RIGHT OFF THE SCALE.

733
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,479
IT'S REMAINED AT A PEAK
EVER SINCE SHE DISAPPEARED.

734
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:03,568

735
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,498
YOU THINK WE'RE
BEING INVITED IN?

736
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,584
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE IT,

737
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,545
AND THE INVITATION
DOESN'T EXACTLY RELAX ME.

738
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,463
I'D RATHER BE ON

00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:25,924

CREATED THIS?

856
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,381
ARE THERE ANY
REPRESENTATIVES HERE?

857
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,967
THERE WERE REPLICAS
OF ONE OF THEM.

858
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,303
BUT THAT POWER
TO RECREATE THEM
HAS BEEN DESTROYED.

859
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:30,807
<i>THAT</i> IS A LOSS,
CAPTAIN.

860
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,891
WELL, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
THOUGHT SO, MR. SPOCK,
IF YOU'D BEEN AMONG US.

861
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,769
[WHIRRING]

862
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,649
<i>MY FELLOW KALANDANS,</i>

863
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,651
<i>WELCOME.</i>

864
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,444
<i>A DISEASE</i>
<i>HAS DESTROYED US.</i>

865
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,196
<i>BEWARE OF IT.</i>

866
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,739
<i>AFTER YOUR LONG JOURNEY,</i>

867
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:49,408
<i>I AM SORRY TO GIVE YOU</i>
<i>ONLY A RECORDED WELCOME,</i>

868
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:52,077
<i>BUT WE WHO HAVE GUARDED</i>
<i>THE OUTPOST FOR YOU</i>

869
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:56,040
<i>WILL BE DEAD BY THE TIME</i>
<i>YOU TAKE POSSESSION</i>
<i>OF THIS PLANET.</i>

870
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:59,960
<i>I AM THE LAST OF OUR</i>
<i>ADVANCE FORCE LEFT ALIVE.</i>

871
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,421
<i>TOO LATE THE PHYSICIANS</i>
<i>DISCOVERED THE CAUSE</i>

872
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,841
<i>OF THE SICKNESS</i>
<i>THAT KILLS US.</i>

873
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,009
<i>IN CREATING THIS PLANET,</i>

874
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,471
<i>WE HAVE ACCIDENTALLY</i>
<i>PRODUCED A DEADLY ORGANISM.</i>

875
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:14,891
<i>I HAVE AWAITED THE REGULAR</i>
<i>SUPPLY SHIP FROM HOME</i>
<i>FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE,</i>

876
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:19,188
<i>BUT I DOUBT NOW WHETHER</i>
<i>IT WILL ARRIVE IN TIME.</i>

877
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,692
<i>I WILL SET</i>
<i>THE OUTPOST CONTROLS</i>
<i>ON AUTOMATIC.</i>

878
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,653
<i>THE COMPUTER</i>
<i>WILL SELECTIVELY DEFEND</i>

879
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,531
<i>AGAINST ALL LIFE FORMS</i>
<i>BUT OUR OWN.</i>

880
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,493
<i>MY FELLOW KALANDANS,</i>

881
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,995
<i>I, LOSIRA...</i>

882
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,333
<i>WISH YOU WELL.</i>

883
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,753
THE PREVIOUS SHIPS
PROBABLY SPREAD THE DISEASE

884
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:43,295
ALL THROUGH THEIR PEOPLE.

885
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,173
THE SUPPLY SHIP THAT
SHE WAS WAITING FOR
NEVER CAME.

886
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,634
ALL THESE
THOUSANDS OF YEARS,
SHE'S BEEN WAITING

887
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,388
TO GREET PEOPLE
WHO WERE...DEAD.

888
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,432
TO DO THE JOB
OF DEFENSE,

889
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,393
THE COMPUTER PROJECTED
A REPLICA

890
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,228
OF THE ONLY IMAGE
AVAILABLE--

891
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,354
LOSIRA'S.

892
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,899
THE COMPUTER
WAS TOO PERFECT.

893
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,359
IT PROJECTED SO MUCH
OF LOSIRA'S PERSONALITY

894
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,780
INTO THE REPLICA
THAT IT FELT REGRET,

895
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:11,323
GUILT AT KILLING.

896
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:14,619
THAT BOUGHT US
THE TIME WE NEEDED
TO DESTROY IT.

897
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:18,205
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN...

898
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,582
A REMARKABLE WOMAN.

899
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,292
AND BEAUTIFUL.

900
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:24,670
BEAUTY IS TRANSITORY,
DOCTOR.

901
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:28,549
HOWEVER, SHE WAS EVIDENTLY
HIGHLY INTELLIGENT.

902
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,135
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>
FIVE TO BEAM UP.

903
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,429
I DON'T AGREE
WITH YOU, MR. SPOCK.
INDEED, CAPTAIN?

904
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:36,056
BEAUTY...

905
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,935
SURVIVES.
