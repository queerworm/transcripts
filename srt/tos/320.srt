10
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,419
THEY ARE RECEIVING
US, CAPTAIN.

11
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,547
I READ NO EVIDENCE
OF MALFUNCTION.

12
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,425
REPEAT--FEDERATION ORDERS
TO DETAIN YOU FOR--

13

PURSUE AND OVERTAKE.

00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,152
IF IT CONTINUES
ON COURSE,

19
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,572
IT WILL ENTER
ROMULAN SPACE.

20
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,240
ENGAGE.

21
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,992
Sulu: TRACTOR BEAM

BRING THEM IN.

23
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,452
THEY'VE NOT
GONE FAR, SIR.

24
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,038
THEY'RE STRUGGLING
TO ESCAPE.

25
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,832
THEIR ENGINES ARE SERIOUSLY
OVERHEATING, CAPTAIN.

26
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,753
<i>AURORA,</i> CUT POWER.

27
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,422

29
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,802
THEY CANNOT CONTINUE.

POWER BEYOND CRITICAL.

00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,397
EXPLOSION IS IMMINENT.

36
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,694
ARE WE WITHIN
TRANSPORTATION RANGE?

37
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,905

00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,067
THEY ARE.

00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,611
AND A NICE LOT, TOO.

45
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,421
SPACE...
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

46
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,848
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

47
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:05,602
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--
TO EXPLORE STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

48
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,564
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

49
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,276
TO BOLDLY GO
WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

50
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,446
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 5832.3.

51
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,033
THE SON OF THE CATULLAN
AMBASSADOR IS ONE OF 6

52
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,161
WE HAVE BEAMED ABOARD
FROM THE STOLEN CRUISER<i> AURORA.</i>

53
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,830
WE HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO
HANDLE HIM WITH EXTREME DELICACY

54
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,750
BECAUSE THE TREATY NEGOTIATIONS
NOW IN PROGRESS

55
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:14,588
BETWEEN THE FEDERATION AND
CATULLA ARE IN A CRUCIAL PHASE.

56
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,715
SCOTTY, TAKE THEM
TO THE BRIEFING ROOM.

57
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,551
Woman, on intercom:
WE ARE NOT IN THE MOOD,
HERBERT.

58
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,178
IRINA?

59
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,888
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

60
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,223
TAKE THIS FOR ME.

61
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,433
Man, on intercom:
NO, HERBERT.
IT'S NO GO.

62
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,268
All, on intercom:
NO GO! NO GO...

63
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,561
WHAT'S GOING ON?

64
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,562
Scott, on intercom:
THEY REFUSE, SIR.

65
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,521
WHY?

66
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,107
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

67
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,900
THEY'RE JUST
SITTING ON THE FLOOR,
THE LOT OF THEM.

68
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,526
YOU CAN HEAR
THEM YOURSELF.

69
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,153
SHALL I SEND
FOR SECURITY?

70
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,738
NO, I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

71
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,573
MR. SPOCK--

72
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,827
All: NO GO! NO GO!
NO GO! NO GO!

73
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:51,041
NO GO! NO GO! NO GO! NO GO!
NO GO! NO GO! NO GO--

74
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,294
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS TONGO RAD?

75
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,174
YOU CAN THANK
YOUR FATHER'S INFLUENCE

76
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,260
FOR THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE NOT UNDER ARREST.

77
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,762
IN ADDITION TO PIRACY,
YOU'VE LEFT YOURSELF OPEN

78
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,764
TO CHARGES OF VIOLATING
FLIGHT REGULATIONS,

79
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:06,974
ENTERING HOSTILE SPACE,

80
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,893
AND ENDANGERING
THE LIVES OF OTHERS,
AS WELL AS YOUR OWN.

81
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,436
I'M BLEEDING.

82
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,565
IN ADDITION, YOU'VE CAUSED
AN INTERSTELLAR INCIDENT...

83
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,735
WHICH MAY HAVE
DESTROYED EVERYTHING
THAT'S BEEN NEGOTIATED

84
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,821
BETWEEN YOUR PLANET
AND THE FEDERATION.

85
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,158
YOU'VE GOT
A HARD LIP, HERBERT.

86
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:28,787
IF YOU HAVE AN EXPLANATION,
I AM PREPARED TO HEAR IT.

87
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:46,930
WELL, MR. SPOCK,
TAKE THEM TO SICK BAY
FOR A MEDICAL CHECK.

88
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,267
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
RADIATION FROM
THE EXPLOSION.

89
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:54,104
CAPTAIN...
WITH YOUR PERMISSION...

90
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,563
BY ALL MEANS.

91
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,283
ONE.

92
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,244
WE ARE ONE.

93
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,122
Spock:
ONE IS THE BEGINNING.

94
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,373
ARE YOU ONE,
HERBERT?

95
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,336
I AM NOT HERBERT.

96
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,297
HE'S NOT HERBERT.
WE REACH.

97
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,758
IF YOU WILL STATE
YOUR PURPOSE AND
YOUR OBJECTIVES,

98
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,012
PERHAPS WE CAN ARRIVE
AT A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING.

99
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,182
IF YOU UNDERSTAND ONE...

100
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,433
YOU KNOW OUR PURPOSE.

101
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,562
I WOULD PREFER
THAT YOU STATE IT.

102
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,772
WE TURN OUR BACKS
ON CONFUSION

103
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,149
AND SEEK THE BEGINNING.

104
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,817
WHAT IS
YOUR DESTINATION?

105
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,319
THE PLANET EDEN.

106
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:46,323
THAT PLANET
IS A MYTH.

107
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:50,118
AND WE PROTEST AGAINST
BEING HARASSED, PURSUED,

108
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:54,248
ATTACKED, SEIZED,
AND TRANSPORTED HERE
AGAINST OUR WISHES.

109
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,290
RIGHT, BROTHER.

110
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,501
WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE
FEDERATION REGULATIONS,

111
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:02,047
NOR THE EXISTENCE
OF HOSTILITIES.

112
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,383
WE RECOGNIZE NO AUTHORITY

113
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,885
SAVE THAT WITHIN OURSELVES.

114
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,178
WELL, WHETHER YOU RECOGNIZE
AUTHORITY OR NOT,

115
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,347
I AM IT ON THIS SHIP.

116
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,474
I AM UNDER ORDERS
TO TRANSPORT YOU BACK
TO STARBASE PEACEABLY.

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,519
FROM THERE, YOU'LL BE FERRIED
TO YOUR VARIOUS PLANETS.

118
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,732
BECAUSE OF MY ORDERS,
YOU ARE NOT PRISONERS,
BUT MY GUESTS.

119
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,234
I EXPECT YOU
TO BEHAVE AS SUCH.

120
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,945
OH, HERBERT,
YOU ARE STIFF!

121
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,364
[LAUGHTER]

122
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,409
MR. SPOCK, YOU SEEM TO
UNDERSTAND THESE PEOPLE.

123
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,952
YOU WILL DEAL WITH THEM.

124
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,122
WE RESPECTFULLY
REQUEST THAT YOU
TAKE US TO EDEN.

125
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,915
AND AFTER THEY ARE
FINISHED IN SICK BAY,

126
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,418
SEE TO IT THAT THEY
ARE ESCORTED BACK TO
THEIR PROPER QUARTERS

127
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,086
AND GIVEN WHATEVER
CARE THEY NEED.

128
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,337
Spock:
YES, CAPTAIN.

129
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,883
WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST
THAT YOU TAKE US TO EDEN.

130
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,053
HMM...I HAVE ORDERS
TO THE CONTRARY.

131
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,097
THIS IS NOT
A PASSENGER SHIP.

132
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,890
HERBERT! HERBERT!

133
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,059
All: HERBERT! HERBERT!
HERBERT! HERBERT!

134
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,103
HERBERT!
HERBERT! HERBERT!

135
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,605
HERBERT! HERBERT! HERBERT!
HERBERT! HERBERT! HERBERT!

136
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,317
LIEUTENANT PALMER,

137
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,068
NOTIFY STARBASE
WE HAVE THE 6 ABOARD

138
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,820
WHO STOLE
THE SPACE CRUISER<i> AURORA.</i>

139
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,072
REGRETTABLY, THE SPACE CRUISER
ITSELF WAS DESTROYED.

140
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,115
AYE, SIR.

141
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,532
PERSONAL NOTE FOR
THE CATULLAN AMBASSADOR--

142
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,951
HIS SON IS SAFE.
CAPTAIN.

143
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,119
YES, WHAT IS IT?

144
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,122
SIR, I BELIEVE
I KNOW ONE OF THEM.

145
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,375
AT LEAST, I THINK
I RECOGNIZE HER VOICE.

146
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,754
HER NAME IS
IRINA GALLIULIN.

147
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,382
WE WERE IN STARFLEET
ACADEMY TOGETHER.

148
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,761
ONE OF THOSE
WAS IN THE ACADEMY?

149
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,763
YES, SIR.

150
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,017
SHE...DROPPED OUT.

151
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,394
SHE...

152
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,316
DO YOU WISH TO SEE HER?

153
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,360
PERMISSION
TO LEAVE YOUR POST.

154
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,610
THANK YOU, SIR.

155
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,906
ARE THEY
IN THE SICK BAY?

156
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,241
YES, CAPTAIN.

157
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,536
MR. SPOCK...

158
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:01,500
DO THEY REALLY BELIEVE
THAT EDEN EXISTS?

159
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,377
MANY MYTHS ARE BASED
ON TRUTH, CAPTAIN,

160
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,504
AND THEY ARE NOT
UNINTELLIGENT.

161
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,506
THEIR LEADER,
DR. SEVRIN, IS A MAN--

162
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,632
DR. SEVRIN
IS THEIR LEADER?

163
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,511
YES--A BRILLIANT
RESEARCH ENGINEER

164
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,095
IN THE FIELDS
OF ACOUSTICS,

165
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,639
COMMUNICATIONS,
AND ELECTRONICS ON TIBURON.

166
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,308
HE WAS DISMISSED
FROM HIS POST

167
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,228
WHEN HE STARTED
THIS MOVEMENT.

168
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,731
TONGO RAD
INHERITS HIS FATHER'S
EXTRAORDINARY ABILITIES

169
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,317
IN THE FIELD
OF SPACE STUDIES.

170
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,364
BUT...THEY'VE
REJECTED ALL THAT

171
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,700
AND ALL THAT THIS
TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES,

172
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,702
AND THEY SEEK
THE PRIMITIVE.

173
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,873
THERE ARE MANY WHO
ARE...UNCOMFORTABLE

174
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,542
WITH WHAT
