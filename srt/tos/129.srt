1
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:18,352
ANYTHING, LIEUTENANT?

2
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,854
NO, SIR.

3
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,356
I'VE TRIED EVERY MAJOR
TRANSMITTING STATION
ON DENEVA.

4
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,483
NONE OF THEM
HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED
MY CONTACT SIGNAL.

5
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,778
TRY GSK-783,
SUBSPACE FREQUENCY 3.

6
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,823
SIR, THAT'S A CALL SIGN
FOR A PRIVATE TRANSMITTER.

7
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,241
I'M VERY WELL AWARE
OF THAT, LIEUTENANT.
TRY IT.

8
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,284
YES, SIR.

9
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,036

MR. SPOCK.

10
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,663
AS I SPECULATED, CAPTAIN,

11
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:41,208
THE OVERALL PATTERN
OF MASS INSANITY
DESTROYING CIVILIZATIONS

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,794
FOLLOWS AN ALMOST
STRAIGHT LINE

13
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,796
THROUGH THIS SECTION
OF THE GALAXY.

14
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,007
OVER HERE
THE BETA PORTILIN SYSTEM--

15
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,550
THE ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS.

16
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,969
ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE
GIVEN US INFORMATION

17
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,179
INDICATING THAT THEY
WERE THE BEGINNING.

18
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,514
200 YEARS AGO,

19
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,726
LAVINIUS 5 WAS SWEPT
BY MASS INSANITY,

20
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,436
THEN PHETA SIGNI 12.

21
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,355
THE LAST WAS INGRIAM B,

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,314
TWO YEARS AGO.

23
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,275
AND NEXT IN LINE--
DENEVA.

24
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,904
BONES, WHAT'S
YOUR THEORY

25
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,112
ABOUT THE CAUSE
OF ALL THIS?

26
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,365
THERE IS NO MEDICAL
OR SCIENTIFIC CAUSE

27
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,909
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
ON THOSE PLANETS,
JIM.

28
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,451
BUT IT FOLLOWS
A DEFINITE PATTERN--

29
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:20,247
A SYSTEMATIC PROGRESSION
FROM PLANET TO PLANET.

30
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,623

31
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,250
WE'RE PICKING UP
A SHIP ON
OUR SENSORS,

32
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,960
HEADING
DIRECTLY INTO
THE DENEVAN SUN.

33
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,336
HE'LL BURN UP.

34
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,006

35
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,674
LIEUTENANT UHURA,

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,592
AYE, AYE, SIR.

37
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,976

OF DENEVAN CONFIGURATION,

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,352
HE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE
OUT OF CONTROL.

39
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,605
HIS COURSE IS
STRAIGHT FOR THE SUN.

40
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,190
SCOTTY, TRACTOR BEAMS?

41
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,692

42
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,323
Uhura:
MAKING CONTACT, CAPTAIN.

43
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,201

THE "U.S.S. ENTERPRISE."

48
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,136

REVERSE YOUR COURSE.

49
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,100
DO YOU HEAR ME?

50
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,268
REVERSE YOUR COURSE!

51
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,269

58

IT'S FINALLY GONE!
I'M FREE!

00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,883

SUBWARP SPEED.

68
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,998
TAKE US TO DENEVA.

69
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,791
AYE, AYE, SIR.

70
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,463
THAT DENEVAN SHIP
HEADED DELIBERATELY
INTO THE SUN. WHY?

71
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,840
THERE'S ONE POSSIBILITY.

72
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,093
THE MASS INSANITY
MAY HAVE REACHED
THIS PLANET, TOO.

73
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,763
CAPTAIN, I'M HAVING
DIFFICULTY ON THAT
TRANSMITTER CALL TO DENEVA.

74
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:42,890
KEEP TRYING.

75
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,099
YES, SIR.

Kirk: SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

79
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,253
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,379
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--

81

STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,308
WE HAVE TRACKED ACROSS
THIS SECTION OF THE GALAXY

87
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,228

ALREADY TOUCHED DENEVA.

THAT PLANET,
COLONIZED OVER A CENTURY AGO,

89
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,607
IS ONE OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL IN THE GALAXY.

IS NORMAL, CAPTAIN.

91
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,071

AS A FREIGHTING LINE

I'VE MADE CONTACT
WITH YOUR PRIVATE

I'M SORRY, SIR.

110
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,907

THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE AT
THE MOMENT, CAPTAIN.

113
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,414
THEY STOPPED
BROADCASTING
IMMEDIATELY.

114
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,417

ACKNOWLEDGE MY

123
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,478

HIS WIFE AURELAN.

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,543
MR. SPOCK.

352
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,544
NO, I WON'T.

353
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,800
MR. SPOCK--OH!

354
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,637
BRIDGE,
THIS IS SICK BAY.

355
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,513
TELL DR. McCOY
MR. SPOCK
JUST LEFT HERE.

356
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,766
HE'S DELIRIOUS AND
POSSIBLY DANGEROUS.

357
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,643
ALL DECKS,
SECURITY ALERT.

358
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,352
LOCATE AND RESTRAIN
MR. SPOCK.

359
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,771
HE MAY BE DANGEROUS.

360
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,315
USE PHASERS ON STUN
IF NECESSARY.

361
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,569
MUST TAKE SHIP--

362
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,635
DOWN!

363
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,594
I MUST...

364
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,347
TAKE IT DOWN.

365
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,194
GET HIM BACK TO THE SICK BAY.

366
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,112
USE SECURITY RESTRAINTS.

367
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:52,079
THE K-3 INDICATOR
REGISTERS THE LEVEL OF PAIN.

368
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,539
NOW WATCH IT
AS I TURN IT ON.

369
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:10,388
THAT'S WHAT HE'S
BEEN GOING THROUGH.

370
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,849
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

371
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,642
NO WONDER
THE POOR DEVILS
GO MAD.

372
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,157
DR. McCOY.

373
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,783
CAPTAIN.

374
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,535
SPOCK.

375
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,501
THESE RESTRAINTS WILL
NO LONGER BE NECESSARY.

376
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,879
NOR WILL
YOUR SEDATIVES, DOCTOR.

377
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,924
I'LL BE ABLE
TO RETURN TO DUTY.

378
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,218
I APOLOGIZE
FOR MY WEAKNESS EARLIER

379
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,847
WHEN I TRIED TO TAKE
CONTROL OF THE SHIP.

380
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,351
I SIMPLY
DID NOT UNDERSTAND.

381
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,478
WHAT IS THERE
TO UNDERSTAND,
MR. SPOCK?

382
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,315
I AM A VULCAN, DOCTOR.

383
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,610
PAIN IS A THING
OF THE MIND.

384
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,737
THE MIND CAN BE CONTROLLED.

385
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,780
YOU'RE ONLY HALF VULCAN.

386
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:11,825
WHAT ABOUT
THE HUMAN HALF?

387
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,620
IT IS PROVING TO BE
AN INCONVENIENCE,

388
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,081
BUT IT IS MANAGEABLE.

389
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,209
THE CREATURE, WITH ALL
OF ITS THOUSANDS OF PARTS,

390
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:23,629
EVEN NOW IS PRESSURING ME.

391
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,886
IT WANTS THIS SHIP,

392
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,763
BUT I AM RESISTING.

393
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,724
CAN HE CONTROL IT
THE WAY HE SAYS, BONES?

394
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,810
WHO KNOWS, JIM?

395
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:38,476
I KNOW
THE AMOUNT OF PAIN

396
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,439
THE CREATURE CAN
INFLICT UPON HIM,

397
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,691
BUT WHETHER
HE CAN CONTROL IT
HOUR TO HOUR...

398
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,486
I HAVE MY OWN WILL,
CAPTAIN.

399
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,364
LET ME HELP.

400
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,657
I NEED YOU, SPOCK...

401
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,786
BUT WE CAN'T
TAKE ANY CHANCES.

402
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,249
WE'LL KEEP YOU...

403
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,668
CONFINED
FOR A WHILE LONGER.

404
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:07,547
IF YOU CAN
MAINTAIN CONTROL,

405
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,590
WE'LL SEE.

406
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,635
UHH...

407
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,681
MY NEPHEW.

408
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:18,767
IF HE REGAINS
CONSCIOUSNESS,

409
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,102
WILL HE GO
THROUGH THAT?

410
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,315
YES.

411
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,483
HELP THEM.

412
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,110
I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT TAKES OR COSTS.

413
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,029
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP THEM.

414
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:34,408
JIM, AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

415
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,242
THERE ARE
OVER A MILLION COLONISTS

416
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:38,078
ON THAT PLANET
DOWN THERE

417
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,665
JUST AS MUCH
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

418
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,582
THEY NEED
YOUR HELP, TOO.

419
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:08,984
I AM A VULCAN.
I AM A VULCAN.

420
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,823
THERE IS NO PAIN.

421
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,903
MR. SPOCK. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE STILL CONFINED
TO SICK BAY.

422
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,363
I WAS.

423
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:58,033
HERE, NOW.
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

424
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,911
I HAVE AN ERRAND
ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE.

425
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,205
YOU WILL BEAM ME DOWN
TO THE SAME COORDINATES
AS BEFORE.

426
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,583
NOT LIKELY,
MR. SPOCK.

427
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,376
THAT IS AN ORDER,
MR. SCOTT.

428
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,628
AYE, SIR.
AND I'M SORRY
I HAVE TO DISOBEY IT.

429
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,299
THE CAPTAIN SAID NO ONE
WAS TO TRANSPORT DOWN.

430
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,804
MR. SPOCK.

431
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:27,645
FREEZE RIGHT THERE,
MR. SPOCK,

432
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,773
OR I'LL PUT YOU
TO SLEEP FOR SURE.

433
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,080
THIS IS MR. SCOTT
IN THE TRANSPORTER ROOM.

434
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,873
GET ME THE CAPTAIN.

435
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,468
MR. SPOCK, I GAVE YOU
AN ORDER TO STAY
IN THE SICK BAY.

436
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,137
UNTIL THE PAIN
WAS GONE, CAPTAIN.

437
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,722
IT HAS BEEN
DISCONTINUED...BY ME.

438
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,642
SCOTTY.

439
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,060
HE SAID HE WAS TRANSPORTING
DOWN TO THE SURFACE, SIR.

440
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,187
YOUR ORDERS WERE THAT
NO ONE WAS TO BEAM DOWN

441
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,189
UNLESS YOU AUTHORIZED IT,

442
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,651
AND KNOWING MISTER SPOCK'S
DETERMINATION ON SOME THINGS,

443
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,195
I THOUGHT I'D BETTER HOLD HIM
HERE UNTIL I GOT YOUR ORDERS.

444
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,908
ONE OF THE CREATURES
WILL HAVE TO BE CAPTURED
AND ANALYZED, CAPTAIN.

445
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,828
WE DID NOT HAVE
A CLEAR OPPORTUNITY
TO DO SO EARLIER

446
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,997
WHEN I WAS ATTACKED.

447
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,667
SINCE MY NERVOUS SYSTEM
IS ALREADY AFFECTED,

448
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,709
AS YOU POINTED OUT,
DOCTOR,

449
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,630
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY
CAN DO MUCH MORE TO ME.

450
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,131
JIM, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

451
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,132
I DON'T WANT MY PATIENTS
RUNNING AROUND.

452
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,592
HE SHOULD BE IN BED.

453
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,805
I AM IN COMPLETE CONTROL
OF MYSELF, DOCTOR.

454
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,641
THE FACT THAT I AM HERE

455
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,560
PROVES THAT I DO NOT
BELONG IN BED.

456
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,441
MR. SPOCK...

457
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:58,778
YOUR LOGIC, AS USUAL,

458
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,364
IS INESCAPABLE.

459
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,618
BEAM HIM DOWN.

460
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,078
STAY IN CONSTANT
TOUCH WITH US.

461
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,663
GIVE HIM YOUR PHASER.
HE'LL NEED THAT, TOO.

462
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,167
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

463
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,177
ENERGIZE.

464
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,533
JIM, THAT MAN IS SICK.

465
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,326
DON'T GIVE ME
ANY DAMNABLE LOGIC

466
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,370
ABOUT HIM BEING
THE ONLY MAN
FOR THE JOB.

467
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,581
I DON'T HAVE TO, BONES.
WE BOTH KNOW HE IS.

468
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,258
[BUZZING]

469
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,156
[SQUEAK SQUEAK]

470
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,024
COME IN, GENTLEMEN.

471
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,361
I BELIEVE YOU'LL
FIND THIS INTERESTING.

472
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,368
DOCTOR, YOUR MEDICAL
SKILL AND CURIOSITY

473
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,286
ARE QUITE ADMIRABLE,

474
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,289
BUT I ASSURE YOU
I'M ALL RIGHT.

475
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,793
YOU MAY BE
CONTROLLING
THE PAIN, MR. SPOCK,

476
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,128
BUT YOU'RE FAR
FROM ALL RIGHT.

477
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:46,256
UNIMPORTANT
AT THE MOMENT, DOCTOR.

478
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,466
PLEASE OBSERVE.

479
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,475
INTERESTING, GENTLEMEN.

480
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,686
A ONE-CELLED CREATURE
RESEMBLING, MORE THAN
ANYTHING ELSE,

481
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:03,482
A HUGE, INDIVIDUAL
BRAIN CELL.

482
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,943
YES. THAT WOULD ANSWER
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

483
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,903
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
I'M SUGGESTING, CAPTAIN?

484
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,947
I THINK SO.

485
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,366
THIS MAY BE ONE CELL
IN A LARGER ORGANISM,

486
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,494
AN INCREDIBLY HUGE ORGANISM,
IN FACT.

487
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,747
AND ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT
PHYSICALLY CONNECTED
TO THE OTHER CELLS,

488
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:22,501
IT IS, NEVERTHELESS,
PART OF THE WHOLE CREATURE,

489
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:23,543
GUIDED BY THE WHOLE,

490
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,296
DRAWING ITS STRENGTH
FROM THE WHOLE,

491
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,174
WHICH PROBABLY ACCOUNTS
FOR ITS UNUSUAL RESISTANCE

492
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,301
TO OUR PHASER WEAPONS.

493
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,846
EXISTING SO DIFFERENTLY

494
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:36,723
FROM ANY LIVING MATTER
OR ENERGY AS WE KNOW IT,

495
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,476
THAT IT MAY HAVE COME HERE
PLANET BY PLANET

496
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,437
FROM AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT GALAXY.

497
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:46,107
FROM A PLACE WHERE
OUR PHYSICAL LAWS
DO NOT APPLY.

498
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,318
WE MAY THEREFORE
FIND IT DIFFICULT
TO DESTROY, CAPTAIN.

499
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,697
BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE,
MR. SPOCK.

500
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,031
THE DENEVAN
THAT FLEW INTO THE SUN

501
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,241
CRIED OUT THAT HE WAS FREE,
THAT HE'D WON.

502
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,744
THAT'S THE ANGLE
TO WORK ON, GENTLEMEN.

503
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,747
I WANT AN ANALYSIS
OF ALL THIS

504
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,040
FROM MEDICAL AND
LIFE SCIENCE DEPARTMENTS

505
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,084
WITHIN THE HOUR.

506
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,294
YES, SIR.

507
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,999
I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN.
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING I CAN.

508
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,002
VARIANT RADIATION,
INTENSE HEAT EVEN AS GREAT
AS 9,000 DEGREES.

509
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,629
THEN YOU'RE
WASTING YOUR TIME.

510
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,297
THERE HAS TO BE
SOMETHING THAT'LL
KILL THE CREATURE

511
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,298
WITHOUT DESTROYING
THE HUMAN HOST.

512
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,884
WHICH HAPPENS
TO BE MY POINT.

513
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,677
THE THING WON'T DIE,

514
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,762
EVEN AT TEMPERATURES
AND RADIATION

515
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,556
WHICH WOULD BURN SPOCK
AND YOUR NEPHEW TO ASHES.

516
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:00,557
I CAN'T
ACCEPT THAT, BONES.

517
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,939
WE'VE GOT 14 SCIENCE
LABS ABOARD THIS SHIP.

518
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:08,899
THE FINEST EQUIPMENT AND
COMPUTERS IN THE GALAXY.

519
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:12,485
CAPTAIN...

520
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,321
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERN--

521
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,282
YOUR AFFECTION
FOR SPOCK,

522
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,034
THE FACT
THAT YOUR NEPHEW

523
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,244
IS THE LAST SURVIVOR
OF YOUR BROTHER'S
FAMILY.

524
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,956
NO, NO, BONES.

525
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,583
THERE'S MORE THAN
TWO LIVES AT STAKE HERE.

526
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:30,045
I CANNOT LET IT SPREAD
BEYOND THIS COLONY,

527
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,965
EVEN IF IT MEANS
DESTROYING

528
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,967
A MILLION PEOPLE
DOWN THERE.

529
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,433
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG.
STARDATE 3289.8.

530
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,102
I AM FACED
WITH THE MOST DIFFICULT

531
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,186
DECISION OF MY LIFE.

532
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,397
UNLESS WE FIND A WAY
TO DESTROY THE CREATURES

533
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,942
WITHOUT KILLING
THEIR HUMAN HOSTS,

534
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,944
MY COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES

535
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:58,865
WILL FORCE ME TO KILL
OVER A MILLION PEOPLE.

536
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,742
GENTLEMEN.

537
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,912
I REGRET I SEE NO OTHER
CHOICE FOR YOU, CAPTAIN.

538
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,832
WE ALREADY KNOW
THIS THING HAS DESTROYED
3 CIVILIZATIONS.

539
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,249
PERHAPS MORE.

540
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,918
GENTLEMEN, I WANT
IT STOPPED, TOO,

541
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,377
BUT NOT AT THE COST
OF DESTROYING

542
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,796
OVER A MILLION
PEOPLE.

543
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,632
INCLUDING MYSELF, DOCTOR,

544
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,468
AND CAPTAIN KIRK'S
YOUNG NEPHEW.

545
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,929
UNDERSTANDABLY UPSETTING,

546
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,598
BUT ONCE IT SPREADS
PAST HERE,

547
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,224
THERE ARE DOZENS
OF COLONIES BEYOND

548
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,726
AND BILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

549
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:31,690
IF KILLING
5 PEOPLE SAVES 10,
IT'S A BARGAIN.

550
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,192
IS THAT YOUR SIMPLE
LOGIC, MISTER SPOCK?

551
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,778
I WILL ACCEPT NEITHER OF THOSE
ALTERNATIVES, GENTLEMEN.

552
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:40,198
I CANNOT LET THIS THING
EXPAND BEYOND THIS PLANET,

553
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,284
NOR DO I INTEND TO KILL
A MILLION OR MORE PEOPLE
TO STOP IT.

554
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,494
I WANT ANOTHER ANSWER.

555
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,667
I'M PUTTING YOU GENTLEMEN
THE HOT SEAT WITH ME.

556
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,544
I WANT
THAT THIRD ALTERNATIVE.

557
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,386
REPORT.

558
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,262
I'M SORRY, JIM.
WE'VE BEEN
OVER AND OVER IT,

559
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,973
WE'VE MADE EVERY
CONCEIVABLE TEST.

560
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,683
I THEREFORE
REQUEST PERMISSION

561
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,518
TO BEAM DOWN TO
THE PLANET'S SURFACE.

562
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,645
I ALSO SUGGEST YOUR NEPHEW
ACCOMPANY ME.

563
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,147
REQUEST DENIED.

564
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,066
CAPTAIN...

565
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,902
I DO NOT MAKE
THIS REQUEST LIGHTLY.

566
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,319
I DO NOT KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER

567
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,613
I CAN HOLD OUT
AGAINST THE PAIN.

568
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,657
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT THE BOY
WILL GO THROUGH

569
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,285
SHOULD HE REGAIN
CONSCIOUSNESS.

570
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,537
REQUEST DENIED.

571
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,583
THERE MUST BE
ANOTHER ANSWER.

572
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:38,673
SOMETHING IN THE SUN
KILLED THAT THING

573
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,217
BEFORE THE DENEVAN DIED.

574
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,765
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

575
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,560
WE'VE TRIED...HEAT,

576
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,020
RADIATION.

577
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,149
WHAT OTHER QUALITIES
OR PROPERTIES

578
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,275
DOES THE SUN HAVE?

579
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,862
IT EXISTS
PHYSICALLY.

580
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,405
IT OCCUPIES SPACE,

581
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,324
IT HAS MASS,
THEREFORE, GRAVITY.

582
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,827
IT CONVERTS
MATTER TO ENERGY.

583
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,663
[PULSING]

584
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,416
JIM, WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH IT AND
THROUGH IT.

585
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,544
RADIATION,
HEAT...

586
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,631
BUT ONE OTHER THING
YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED.

587
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,469
IT'S BRIGHT.

588
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,430
IT RADIATES
A BLINDING LIGHT
IF YOU'RE CLOSE ENOUGH.

589
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,848
NOTHING LETHAL
ABOUT LIGHT.

590
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,059
NOT TO US.
BUT DOWN ON THE SURFACE,

591
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,019
THE CREATURES
STAYED IN THE SHADOWS
FOR THE MOST PART.

592
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,438
SUPPOSE...
THEY WEREN'T
SIMPLY HIDING.

593
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,816
SUPPOSE THEY'RE
SENSITIVE TO LIGHT,

594
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,193
LIGHT, LIKE IN A SUN
CLOSE UP.

595
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:45,782
A POSSIBILITY.

596
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,326
YOU CAN'T MOVE DENEVA
CLOSER TO THE SUN, JIM.

597
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,246
NO, BUT YOU CAN
MOVE THE EQUIVALENT
OF THE SUN TO DENEVA!

598
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,205
MR. SPOCK?

599
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,625
YES. IN ESSENCE
IT CAN BE DONE--

600
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,418
A STRING OF SATELLITES
AROUND THE PLANET

601
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,838
WITH BURNING TRIMAGNESITE
AND TRITIUM.

602
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:02,715
[SIGH]

603
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:06,219
WELL, I CAN RIG
A TEST CUBICLE
IN A BIO LAB,

604
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,345
PUT OUR SPECIMEN
IN IT.

605
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:07,846
BUT I DON'T--

606
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,514
GOOD.

607
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,556
LET'S GET ON IT.

608
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,156
YOUR FIGURES ARE,
OF COURSE, ACCURATE.

609
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,991
OF COURSE.

610
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,534
THE LIGHT OF THE SUN

611
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,537
AT THE PROXIMITY
WHERE THE DENEVAN
DECLARED HIMSELF FREE

612
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,456
WAS 1 MILLION CANDLES
PER SQUARE INCH.

613
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,209
IF THIS WORKS,

614
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:40,837
THE SATELLITES WE ORBIT
WILL PRODUCE LIGHT
OF SUCH INTENSITY

615
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,548
THAT EVEN SOMEONE
IN A CLOSED, DARKENED AREA

616
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:44,841
WILL BE AFFECTED BY IT.

617
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,425
READY, DOCTOR.

618
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,677
PUT ON
YOUR MASKS.

619
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,567
COMPLETED.

620
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,829
IT WORKED!

621
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,039
WE CAN DO IT.

622
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,630
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
JIM? WE CAN DO IT!

623
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,674
IT WORKED. IN A LAB.

624
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,594
WITH THE CREATURE
EXPOSED TO EVERYTHING
WE CAN GIVE IT.

625
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,597
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE INFECTED?

626
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:33,598
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE TRIAL--

627
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,559
MAYBE? THERE'S NO TIME
FOR MAYBES, BONES.

628
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,353
WE NEED TO KNOW NOW.

629
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,105
BUT I'D HAVE TO
PUT A--

630
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:45,277
YES, WE'D HAVE TO PUT
SOMEONE WHO'S INFECTED
UNDER THAT LIGHT.

631
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:49,114
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
OF THE RISK?

632
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:52,617
WE HAVE TO DUPLICATE
THE CONDITIONS
ON THE PLANET.

633
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:53,952
AND SPOCK...

634
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,703
Spock: CAPTAIN.

635
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,665
YOU'LL NEED A HOST

636
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,584
FOR THE NEXT STEP
IN THE TEST.

637
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,335
TO DETERMINE
WHETHER THE CREATURE

638
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,963
CAN BE DRIVEN
FROM THE BODY.

639
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,840
I AM THE LOGICAL CHOICE.

640
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,593
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
1-MILLION CANDLELIGHT
PER SQUARE INCH

641
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,345
CAN DO
TO YOUR OPTIC NERVES?

642
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,597
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY,
BONES.

643
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,058
WE HAVE TO DUPLICATE
THE BRILLIANCE THAT EXISTED

644
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:21,813
AT THE MOMENT THE DENEVAN
DECLARED HIMSELF FREED.

645
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,650
ALL RIGHT. I'LL RIG UP
A PROTECTIVE PAIR
OF GOGGLES.

646
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:29,154
THERE'LL BE NONE ON
THE PLANET'S SURFACE, DOCTOR.

647
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,947
I AGREE COMPLETELY.

648
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,701
UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

649
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,579
IT'S THE ONLY THING
WE CAN DO.

650
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,540
ALL RIGHT, MR. SPOCK.

651
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,959
MR. SPOCK'S
THE BEST FIRST OFFICER
IN THE FLEET.

652
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,169
PROCEED.

653
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,612
COMPLETED.

654
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,342
SPOCK, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

655
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,052
THE CREATURE WITHIN ME
IS GONE.

656
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,137
I AM FREE OF IT...

657
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:19,347
AND THE PAIN.

658
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,478
I AM ALSO...

659
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,938
QUITE BLIND.

660
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,734
AN EQUITABLE TRADE,
DOCTOR.

661
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:32,610
THANK YOU.

662
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,995
DOCTOR, THE RESULTS
OF THE FIRST TESTS

663
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,914
ON THE CREATURE'S REMAINS...

664
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,883
OH, NO.

665
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,845
WHAT IS IT?

666
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,141
I THREW THE TOTAL
SPECTRUM OF LIGHT
AT THE CREATURE.

667
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,559
IT WASN'T NECESSARY.

668
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,687
I DIDN'T
STOP TO THINK

669
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:12,024
THAT MORE THAN
ONE KIND OF LIGHT
MIGHT'VE KILLED IT.

670
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,568
INTERESTING.

671
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,571
JUST AS DOGS
ARE SENSITIVE
TO CERTAIN SOUNDS

672
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,739
WHICH HUMANS
CANNOT HEAR,

673
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:22,910
THESE CREATURES EVIDENTLY
ARE SENSITIVE TO LIGHT
WHICH WE CANNOT SEE.

674
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,037
ARE YOU TELLING ME...

675
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,915
THAT SPOCK NEED NOT
HAVE BEEN BLINDED?

676
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:33,671
I DIDN'T NEED TO THROW
THE BLINDING WHITE LIGHT
AT ALL, JIM.

677
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:39,844
SPOCK, I--

678
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:42,972
DOCTOR, IT WAS
MY SELECTION AS WELL.

679
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,807
IT IS DONE.

680
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,812
BONES.

681
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:55,443
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

682
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,961
COMPLETING
THE SEEDING ORBIT, CAPTAIN.

683
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:17,465
210 ULTRAVIOLET SATELLITES
NOW IN POSITION.

684
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,758
72 MILES ALTITUDE.

685
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,052
PERMANENT ORBIT
ABOUT THE PLANET.

686
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,095
GOOD. SCANNERS?

687
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,015
SCANNERS READY, SIR.

688
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,808
VERY WELL.
READY, HELM?

689
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,352
READY, CAPTAIN.

690
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,187
SATELLITE CONTROL,
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

691
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,730
ENERGIZE ALL SATELLITES.

692
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,483
AFFIRMATIVE.

693
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,776
ALL SATELLITES
OPERATIVE, CAPTAIN.

694
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,280
CAPTAIN, RECEIVING MESSAGES
FROM OUR GROUND STATION.

695
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,240
REPORT.

696
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,991
THE THINGS ARE DYING, SIR.

697
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,285
IT'S WORKING.

698
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:38,795
SICK BAY.

699
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,675
McCOY HERE.

700
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,845
TELL SPOCK...

701
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,055
IT WORKED.

702
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,685
YES, CAPTAIN.

703
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,353
HE'LL BE HAPPY
TO HEAR THAT.

704
00:46:57,774 --> 00:46:58,566
BONES...

705
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,779
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

706
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,282
BONES.

707
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,787
BONES.

708
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:24,049
YEOMAN, RECORD THIS
FOR STARFLEET COMMAND.

709
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,301
READY, SIR.

710
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,428
THE ALIEN CREATURES
ON DENEVA HAVE BEEN
DESTROYED--

711
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,472
CAPTAIN, LOOK.
MR. SPOCK.

712
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,058
Kirk:
SPOCK.

713
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:37,938
YOU CAN SEE.

714
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,900
THE BLINDNESS
WAS TEMPORARY, JIM.

715
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,820
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
HIS OPTICAL NERVES

716
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,322
WHICH AREN'T THE SAME
AS A HUMAN'S.

717
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,491
AN HEREDITARY TRAIT,
CAPTAIN.

718
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:49,701
THE BRIGHTNESS
OF THE VULCAN SUN

719
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:52,995
HAS CAUSED THE DEVELOPMENT
OF AN INNER EYELID,

720
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,956
WHICH ACTS
AS A SHIELD AGAINST
HIGH-INTENSITY LIGHT.

721
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,958
TOTALLY INSTINCTIVE,
DOCTOR.

722
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,586
WE TEND TO IGNORE IT,
AS YOU IGNORE YOUR
OWN APPENDIX.

723
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,805
MR. SPOCK.

724
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,353
REGAINING EYESIGHT
WOULD BE AN EMOTIONAL
EXPERIENCE FOR MOST.

725
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,355
YOU, I PRESUME,
FELT NOTHING?

726
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,897
QUITE THE CONTRARY,
CAPTAIN.

727
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,776
I HAD A VERY
STRONG REACTION.

728
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,277
MY FIRST SIGHT

729
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:29,156
WAS THE FACE OF DR. McCOY
BENDING OVER ME.

730
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,992
'TIS A PITY
YOUR BRIEF BLINDNESS
DID NOT INCREASE

731
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,119
YOUR APPRECIATION
FOR BEAUTY,
MR. SPOCK.

732
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,246
IF YOU GENTLEMEN
ARE FINISHED,

733
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:36,288
WOULD YOU MIND
LAYING IN A COURSE

734
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,874
FOR STARBASE 10,
MR. SPOCK?

735
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,291
MY PLEASURE,
CAPTAIN.

736
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,841
UNUSUAL EYE ARRANGEMENT.

737
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,844
I MIGHT'VE KNOWN
HE'D TURN UP WITH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

738
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,220
WHAT'S THAT,
DOCTOR?

739
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,722
I SAID, PLEASE DON'T
TELL SPOCK THAT I SAID

740
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,433
HE WAS THE BEST
FIRST OFFICER
IN THE FLEET.

741
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,436
WHY, THANK YOU,
DR. McCOY.

742
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,899
YOU'VE BEEN SO CONCERNED
ABOUT HIS VULCAN EYES,
DOCTOR.

743
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,276
YOU FORGOT ABOUT
HIS VULCAN EARS.

744
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,111
AHEAD WARP FACTOR 1,
MR. SULU.

745
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:08,446
WARP FACTOR 1,
SIR.
