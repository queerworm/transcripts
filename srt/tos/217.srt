00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,303
APPROACHING
SIGMA IOTA 2,
CAPTAIN.

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,305
STANDARD ORBIT,
MR. CHEKOV.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,350
CAPTAIN, I HAVE
RECEIVED VOCAL CONTACT

4
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,310
FROM
AN OFFICIAL STATION.

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,396
THEY RELAYED US
TO A MAN NAME OKMYX.

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,815
HIS TITLE IS "BOSS."

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,692
HA, HA.

8
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:25,400
BOSS?

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,696
ALL RIGHT, LIEUTENANT,
PUT HIM ON.

10
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,405
OKMYX.

11
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,199
THIS IS CAPTAIN
JAMES T. KIRK

12
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,868
OF THE STARSHIP
<i>ENTERPRISE,</i>

13
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,661
REPRESENTING
THE FEDERATION
OF PLANETS.

14
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:36,745
<i>HELLO, CAPTAIN.</i>

15
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:40,415
<i>YOU'RE FROM THE SAME</i>
<i>OUTFIT AS THE</i> HORIZON?

16
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,918
YES. UNFORTUNATELY,
THE<i> HORIZON</i> WAS LOST
WITH ALL HANDS

17
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,879
SHORTLY AFTER
LEAVING YOUR PLANET.

18
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,631
WE ONLY RECEIVED
HER RADIO REPORT
LAST MONTH.

19
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>LAST MONTH?</i>

20
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>WHAT ARE YOU</i>
<i>TALKING ABOUT?</i>

21
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,387
<i>THE</i> HORIZON<i> LEFT HERE</i>
<i>100 YEARS AGO.</i>

22
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,931
A LITTLE DIFFICULT
TO EXPLAIN.

23
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,308
WE RECEIVED A REPORT
100 YEARS LATE

24
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,936
BECAUSE IT WAS SENT
BY CONVENTIONAL RADIO.

25
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,773
YOUR SYSTEM IS
ON THE OUTER REACHES
OF THE GALAXY.

26
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,401
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
SUBSPACE COMMUNICATION
IN THOSE DAYS.

27
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,361
<i>TOWARD</i>
<i>THE EDGE OF WHAT?</i>

28
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,239
I'LL EXPLAIN IT IN MORE
DETAIL WHEN I SEE YOU.

29
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,824
THE SHIP WON'T LAND,

30
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,827
BUT WE'LL TRANSPORT
SEVERAL PEOPLE DOWN.

31
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,412
WELL, THAT'S
A LITTLE DIFFICULT

32
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,247
FOR YOU
TO UNDERSTAND, TOO.

33
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,374
I'LL EXPLAIN IT
IN MORE DETAIL

34
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,208
WHEN I SEE YOU.

35
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,835
WHERE WILL
BE CONVENIENT?

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,045
<i>WELL, THERE'S AN INTERSECTION</i>

37
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,295
<i>JUST AT THE END</i>
<i>OF THE BLOCK</i>

38
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,715
<i>NEAR A YELLOW</i>
<i>FIRE PLUG.</i>

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,758
<i>THINK YOU CAN YOU FIND IT?</i>

40
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:31,717
YELLOW FIRE PLUG--

41
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,387
SCOTTY, DO YOU
HAVE THE COORDINATES?

42
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:35,804
LOCATED, SIR.

43
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,556
GOOD.

44
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,350
MR. OKMYX,
WE HAVE YOUR
INTERSECTION LOCATED.

45
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,352
WILL FIVE MINUTES
BE ALL RIGHT?

46
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,938
<i>FINE. FINE.</i>

47
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>I'LL HAVE A RECEPTION</i>
<i>COMMITTEE THERE</i>
<i>TO MEET YOU.</i>

48
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,734
GOOD, I'LL BE LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.
KIRK OUT.

49
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,360
SCOTTY, YOU
HAVE THE COM.

50
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,862
AYE, SIR.

51
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,739
SPOCK, McCOY,
WE'RE BEAMING DOWN.

52
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,615
STANDARD EQUIPMENT.

53
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,953
THE HORIZON'S
CONTACT CAME

54
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,371
BEFORE THE NON-INTERFERENCE
DIRECTIVE WENT INTO EFFECT.

55
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,915
THEY MUST
HAVE INTERFERED

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,917
WITH THE NORMAL
EVOLUTION OF
THE PLANET.

57
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:05,709
IT WILL BE INTERESTING
TO SEE THE RESULTS
OF THE CONTAMINATION.

58
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,502
BUT WE DON'T KNOW THERE
IS A CONTAMINATION.

59
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,005
THE EVIDENCE IS ONLY
CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

60
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,298
WELL, WHAT WAS THE
STATE OF THE IOTIAN
CULTURE

61
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,383
BEFORE
THE<i> HORIZON</i> CAME?

62
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,635
THE BEGINNINGS
OF INDUSTRIALIZATION.

63
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,313
<i>HORIZON</i> REPORTS
INDICATE THE IOTIANS
ARE EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT

64
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,481
AND SOMEWHAT IMITATIVE.

65
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,191
SO WE'RE GOING DOWN
TO RE-CONTAMINATE
THEM.

66
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,193
THE DAMAGE
HAS BEEN DONE, DOCTOR.

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,112
WE ARE HERE
TO REPAIR IT.

68
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,446
LET'S NOT
ARGUE ABOUT IT.

69
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,490
LET'S GO STUDY IT.

70
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,124

72
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,270
FASCINATING.

73
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,230
THIS IS LIKE COMING HOME.

74
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,566
HOME WAS NEVER
LIKE THIS.

75
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,659
I'VE SEEN PICTURES
OF THE OLD DAYS

76
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,243
THAT LOOK LIKE THIS.

77
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,202
INTERESTING,

LET'S SEE YOU PETRIFIED.

SIR, WOULD YOU
MIND EXPLAINING
THAT STATEMENT, PLEASE?

83
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,221
I WANT TO SEE YOU
TURN TO STONE.

84
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,057
PUT YOUR HANDS
OVER YOUR HEAD,

85
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,266

TO HAVE NO HEAD

86
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,561

ASKED TO COME DOWN HERE

98
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,690
BY A MR. OKMYX. HE SAID--

99
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,234
I KNOW WHAT HE SAID, BUD.

100
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,153

THAT'S WHY YOU
CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.

175
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,629
YOU'RE THE GOVERNMENT
HERE?

176
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,340
WHAT GOVERNMENT?

177
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:30,135
LIKE I TOLD YOU, I
GOT THE TERRITORY,
AND I RUN IT, THAT'S ALL.

178
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,762
BUT THERE
ARE OTHER BOSSES,
OTHER TERRITORIES?

179
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,389
YEAH, SURE.

180
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,350
MAYBE A DOZEN OR SO,

181
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,977
NOT COUNTING
THE SMALL FRY,

182
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,229
BUT THEN THEY
GET BURNED ANYWAY,

183
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,148
AS SOON AS I
GET AROUND TO IT.

184
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,275
DOES THAT INCLUDE,
IF I MAY ASK,

185
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,027
A GENTLEMAN
CALLED KRAKO?

186
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,447
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT KRAKO?

187
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,614
HE HIT US, BOSS.

188
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,202
O.K.

189
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,163
YOU HIT HIM BACK,
YOU HEAR? HARD.

190
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,831
I'LL HANDLE IT.

191
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,804
CAPTAIN?

192
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,515
DOCTOR.

193
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,268
GANGSTERS.

194
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:20,768
CHICAGO.

195
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,687
MOBS.

196
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,024
PUBLISHED IN 1992.

197
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,818
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?

198
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,945
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S THE BOOK.

199
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,947
I KNOW IT'S A BOOK.

200
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,574
<i>THE</i> BOOK.

201
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,160
THEY LEFT IT,
THE OTHER SHIP,
THE<i> HORIZON.</i>

202
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,246
THIS IS THE
CONTAMINATION,
CAPTAIN.

203
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,163
ASTONISHING.

204
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,790
AN ENTIRE
CULTURE
BASED ON THIS.

205
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,126
YOU SAID THEY
WERE IMITATIVE
AND THE BOOK--

206
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,212
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE
CRACKS ABOUT THE BOOK.

207
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,630
DID THEY LEAVE
ANY OTHER BOOKS?

208
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,840
YEAH, SURE.

209
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,343
SOME TEXTBOOKS ON HOW
TO MAKE RADIO SETS

210
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,928
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,

211
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,223
BUT LOOK, I BROUGHT YOU
HERE SO YOU COULD HELP ME,

212
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,142
NOT FOR YOU TO
ASK ME QUESTIONS.

213
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,770
AFTER THAT,
I'LL ANSWER ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

214
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,105
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

215
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,232
WELL...

216
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,650
I WAS THINKING.

217
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,907
YOU FEDS MUST HAVE MADE
A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS

218
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,867
SINCE THAT OTHER
SHIP CAME HERE.

219
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:22,163
YOU PROBABLY GOT ALL KINDS
OF FANCY HEATERS UP THERE.

220
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,291
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

221
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,292
YOU GIVE ME ALL
THE HEATERS I NEED--

222
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,293
ENOUGH TOOLS
SO I CAN

223
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,546
KNOCK OFF ALL
THOSE PUNKS ALL AT ONCE.

224
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,214
THEN I'LL TAKE OVER,
THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO
DO IS DEAL WITH ME.

225
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,215
NOW LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT.

226
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,133
YOU WANT US
TO SUPPLY YOU

227
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,928
WITH ARMS AND ASSISTANCE

228
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,221
SO YOU CAN CARRY OUT
AN AGGRESSION AGAINST
YOUR NEIGHBORS?

229
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,056
WHAT AGGRESSION?
I GOT TO MAKE SOME HITS.

230
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,975
I WANT YOU TO HELP
ME HIT THEM, THAT'S ALL.

231
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,144
FASCINATING...

232
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,146
BUT QUITE
IMPOSSIBLE.

233
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,274
MR. OKMYX, MY ORDERS
ARE QUITE EXPLICIT.

234
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,484
UNDER NO CIRCUM--

235
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,735
I AIN'T INTERESTED
IN<i> YOUR</i> ORDERS.

236
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,030
FROM NOW ON, YOU'RE GOING
TO TAKE ORDERS FROM ME.

237
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,451
I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOU JUST EIGHT HOURS
TO GIVE ME THE THINGS I WANT.

238
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,245
IF I DON'T HAVE
THOSE TOOLS BY THEN,

239
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,998
I'M GOING TO CALL UP YOUR SHIP
AND HAVE THEM PICK YOU UP--
IN A BOX.

240
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,542
IS THAT
UNDERSTOOD, PAL?

241
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,099
HEY, BOSS,

242
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,060
THIS HERE'S
A HEATER,

243
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,396
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS.

244
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:30,649
WELL, LET'S SEE HOW
THIS THING WORKS.

245
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,485
DON'T DO THAT.

246
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,655
YOU COULD
KNOCK OUT THE SIDE
OF THE BUILDING.

247
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,448
THAT GOOD, HUH?

248
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,117
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
GIVE ME ABOUT 100 OF
THESE FANCY HEATERS,

249
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,495
AND WE'LL HAVE
NO MORE TROUBLE.

250
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,538
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

251
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:48,375
CAPTAIN KIRK, I
USUALLY GET WHAT I WANT.

252
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,168
WHAT'S THIS THING?

253
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,880
ALL RIGHT, BURN 'EM.

254
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,549
NOW, HOLD IT.

255
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,802
IT'S A COMMUNICATION
DEVICE.

256
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,096
HOW DOES IT WORK?

257
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,475
IT'S LOCKED ONTO
MY SHIP'S SYSTEM--

258
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,686
KALO, TAKE THEM
TO THE WAREHOUSE

259
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,479
AND PUT THEM IN A BAG.

260
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,897
KEEP A SHARP EYE
ON THEM, YOU HEAR?

261
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,692
IN THE BAG, BOSS.
COME ON.

262
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,079
[COMMUNICATOR BEEPS]

263
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,500
HEY, YOU...

264
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,711
IN THE SHIP UP THERE!

265
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,173
HEY, YOU IN THE SHIP.

266
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,174
SCOTT HERE.

267
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,092
WHO IS THIS?

268
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,635
THIS IS BELA OKMYX.

269
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,598
I GOT YOUR CAPTAIN
AND HIS FRIENDS DOWN HERE.

270
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,183
YOU WANT TO SEE
THEM ALIVE AGAIN,

271
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,561
YOU'LL SEND ME 100
OF THESE FANCY HEATERS

272
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,064
AND SOME TROOPS TO
SHOW ME HOW TO USE THEM.

273
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,359
AM I TO UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE HOLDING THE
CAPTAIN AND HIS PARTY?

274
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,776
YOU HEARD RIGHT, PAL.

275
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,446
I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOU JUST EIGHT HOURS

276
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,448
TO GET ME THE
GOODS I WANT,

277
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,200
OR I PUT THE HIT
ON YOUR FRIENDS.

278
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,286
YOU UNDERSTAND?

279
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,997
I DON'T KNOW.

280
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,166
HEH HEH.

281
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,627
HEH HEH HEH HEH!

282
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:16,087
LIEUTENANT HADLEY,
CHECK THE LANGUAGE BANKS

283
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,839
AND FIND OUT WHAT A...

284
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,550
HEATER IS.

285
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,019
ONE BOOK ON THE
GANGS OF CHICAGO
DID ALL THIS.

286
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,688
IT'S AMAZING.

287
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,565
THEY EVIDENTLY SEIZED
UPON THAT ONE BOOK

288
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,983
AS THE BLUEPRINT
FOR AN ENTIRE SOCIETY.

289
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,151
AS THE BIBLE.

290
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,860
IN OLD CHICAGO,

291
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,781
CONVENTIONAL GOVERNMENT
ALMOST BROKE DOWN, THE
GANGS NEARLY TOOK OVER.

292
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,534
YEAH, WELL, THIS
OKMYX IS THE WORST
GANGSTER OF ALL.

293
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,912
WE MAY QUARREL
WITH MR. OKMYX' METHODS,

294
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,123
BUT HIS GOAL IS
ESSENTIALLY THE
CORRECT ONE.

295
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,833
THIS SOCIETY
MUST BECOME UNITED,

296
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,211
OR IT WILL DEGENERATE
INTO TOTAL ANARCHY.

297
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,588
IF THIS SOCIETY BROKE DOWN

298
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,591
AS A RESULT OF
THE HORIZON'S INFLUENCE,

299
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,176
THEN THE FEDERATION'S
RESPONSIBLE,

300
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,927
AND WE'VE GOT
TO DO SOMETHING TO
STRAIGHTEN THIS MESS OUT.

301
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,264
SPOCK, IF YOU COULD GET TO
THE SOCIOLOGICAL COMPUTERS,

302
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,849
DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD FIND A SOLUTION?

303
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,688
UNFORTUNATELY,
I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS
TO MY COMPUTERS,

304
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,607
NOR ARE THESE GENTLEMEN
LIKELY TO PERMIT IT.

305
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,652
WELL, I'VE GOT AN
IDEA ABOUT THAT.

306
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,907
GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN.

307
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:31,204
THIS--THIS CARD GAME
IS A KID'S GAME.

308
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,163
YOU THINK SO?

309
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,041
OH, YES. I WOULDN'T
WASTE MY TIME.

310
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,167
WHO'S ASKING YOU?

311
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,586
ON BETA ANTARES 4,
THEY PLAY A REAL GAME.

312
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:39,962
IT'S A MAN'S GAME,
BUT OF COURSE, IT'S

313
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,674
PROBABLY A
LITTLE BEYOND YOU.

314
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,675
IT REQUIRES
INTELLIGENCE.

315
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,843
LISTEN, KIRK,

316
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,261
I CAN PLAY ANYTHING
YOU CAN FIGURE OUT.

317
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,306
TAKE THE CARDS,
BIG MAN.

318
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,808
SHOW US
HOW IT'S PLAYED.

319
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,017
CAPTAIN, I AM FAMILIAR WITH
THE CULTURE ON BETA ANTARES 4.

320
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,477
I DON'T KNOW--

321
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,979
SPOCK. SPOCK.

322
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,071
OF COURSE, THE CARDS
ON BETA ANTARES 4
ARE DIFFERENT,

323
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,656
BUT NOT TOO DIFFERENT.

324
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,450
THE NAME OF THE
GAME IS CALLED...

325
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,660
FIZZBIN.

326
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,786
FIZZBIN?

327
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,038
FIZZBIN. IT'S...
NOT TOO DIFFICULT.

328
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,040
EACH PLAYER
GETS SIX CARDS,

329
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,375
EXCEPT FOR THE DEALER--
THE PLAYER ON

330
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,044
THE DEALER'S RIGHT,
WHO GETS SEVEN.

331
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,295
ON THE RIGHT?

332
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,923
YES. THE SECOND CARD
IS TURNED UP,
EXCEPT ON TUESDAY.

333
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,007
ON TUESDAY?

334
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,510
[KIRK]
MM-HMM.

335
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,514
OH, LOOK WHAT YOU
GOT, TWO JACKS.

336
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,725
YOU GOT A HALF
FIZZBIN ALREADY.

337
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:35,894
I NEED ANOTHER JACK.

338
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,978
NO, NO, IF YOU
GOT ANOTHER JACK,

339
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,022
WHY, YOU'D HAVE A SRALK.

340
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:40,940
A SRALK?

341
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,776
YES, YOU'D
BE DISQUALIFIED.

342
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,152
NO, WHAT YOU NEED
NOW IS EITHER A
KING AND A DEUCE,

343
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,072
EXCEPT AT NIGHT, OF COURSE,
WHEN YOU'D NEED A QUEEN AND A 4.

344
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,282
EXCEPT AT NIGHT.

345
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,742
RIGHT.

346

00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,876
HOW WONDERFUL FOR YOU.

351
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,086
NOW, IF YOU DIDN'T
GET ANOTHER JACK--

352
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,922
IF YOU HAD GOTTEN A KING,

353
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,424
WHY, THEN, YOU'D
GET ANOTHER CARD,

354
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,968
EXCEPT WHEN IT'S DARK,
WHEN YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE IT BACK.

YES, BUT WHAT YOU'RE
AFTER IS A ROYAL FIZZBIN,

357
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,893
BUT THE ODDS IN
GETTING A ROYAL FIZZBIN
ARE ASTRON--

358
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,186

IN GETTING A ROYAL FIZZBIN?

359

THEM, CAPTAIN.

ABOUT THE DEAL I WANT.

00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,970
I'M AFRAID I FIND IT
DIFFICULT TO TRUST
YOU, MR. OKMYX.

ABOUT GIVING ME A HAND.

00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,109
YOU WILL SHOW
NO FURTHER
HOSTILITY?

FORCED TO TRUST

511
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,520
THOUGH WE HOPE
TO AVOID INTERFERENCE,

512
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,523
I SUGGEST YOU SET
ONE OF OUR PHASER BANKS

513
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,317
ON A STRONG STUN
POSITION.

514
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,443
AYE, SIR.

515
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,526
NOW YOU'RE BEGINNING
TO MAKE SENSE.

516
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,822
I TRUST WE SHALL
NOT HAVE TO
USE THEM,

517

LIKE A PIECEWORK FACTORY.

868

FROM NOW ON, IT'S GOING
TO BE UNDER ONE ROOF.

00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,962
YOU'RE GOING TO RUN
IT LIKE A--LIKE A BUSINESS.

870
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,257
AND THAT MEANS YOU'RE
GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT.

00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:14,467
AND WHAT'S
YOUR PERCENTAGE?

872
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:19,264
I'M CUTTING THE
FEDERATION IN FOR 40%.

873

IS YOU AND A COUPLE

LET ME SAY SOMETHING.

00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:06,102
I ONLY SAW THREE

ABOUT BOTH.

00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,572

CONTINUE IT, OR ARE YOU
GOING TO DISCUSS IT?

964

BROODING NOR SOMBER.

HAVE RESERVATIONS
ABOUT YOUR SOLUTION

TO THE PROBLEM
OF THE IOTIANS.

967
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,532
AH, YES.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

968
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:48,741
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S LOGICAL

969
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:51,744
TO LEAVE A CRIMINAL
ORGANIZATION IN
CHARGE.

970
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,079

TO COLLECT OUR "CUT."

YES, THAT'S A VERY
GOOD QUESTION, MR. SPOCK.

975
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,681
I PROPOSE THAT OUR

PLANETARY TREASURY

976

THE IOTIANS INTO
A MORE ETHICAL SYSTEM.

DESPITE THEMSELVES,
THEY'LL BE FORCED

978
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,021
TO ACCEPT CONVENTIONAL
RESPONSIBILITIES.

979
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,399
ISN'T THAT LOGICAL?

980
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,656
ALL RIGHT, BONES,

OF THE PLANET,

SERIOUS THIS IS, JIM.

983
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,582

KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU.

00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:38,290
WELL, GO AHEAD.

985
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,168

00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,215

989
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,217
SOMEWHERE.
I'M NOT CERTAIN.

990
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,219
YOU'RE NOT
CERTAIN OF WHAT?

991
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,513
I LEFT MY COMMUNICATOR.

992
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,223
IN BELA'S OFFICE?

993
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,183
CAPTAIN, IF THE IOTIANS,

994
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,728
WHO ARE VERY BRIGHT
AND IMITATIVE PEOPLE,

995
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,354
SHOULD TAKE THAT
COMMUNICATOR APART--

996
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,232
THEY WILL, THEY WILL,
AND THEY'LL FIND OUT
HOW THE TRANSTATOR WORKS.

997
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,859
THE TRANSTATOR
IS THE BASIS

998
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:08,028
FOR EVERY IMPORTANT
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT
THAT WE HAVE.

999
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,197
DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S THAT SERIOUS?

1000
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,156
SERIOUS? SERIOUS, BONES?

1001
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,575
IT UPSETS THE
WHOLE PERCENTAGE.

1002
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,201

1003
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,161
WELL, IN A FEW YEARS,

1004
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,289

A PIECE OF OUR ACTION.
