1
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:07,000
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 5718.3.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,625
THE "ENTERPRISE"
IS ORBITING ELBA II,

3
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,000
A PLANET WITH
A POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,667
WHERE THE FEDERATION
MAINTAINS AN ASYLUM

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:17,458
FOR THE FEW REMAINING
INCORRIGIBLE, CRIMINALLY INSANE

6
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,041
OF THE GALAXY.

7
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:22,667
WE ARE BRINGING A REVOLUTIONARY
NEW MEDICINE TO THEM,

8
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:25,667
A MEDICINE WITH WHICH
THE FEDERATION HOPES

9
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,667
TO ELIMINATE MENTAL ILLNESS
FOR ALL TIME.

10
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,917
I AM TRANSPORTING DOWN
WITH MR. SPOCK,

11
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:33,041
AND WE'RE DELIVERING
THE MEDICINE

12
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,083
TO DR. DONALD CORY,
THE GOVERNOR OF THE COLONY.

13
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,125
DONALD.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

14
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,000
GOVERNOR.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,458
GENTLEMEN,
YOU DON'T KNOW

16
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,375
WHAT A TREAT
THIS IS FOR ME.

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,083
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG
SINCE I'VE HAD
COMPANY, JIM.

18
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,250
THE FORCE FIELD'S
BACK IN PLACE NOW.

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,041
THAT MEANS YOU TWO
ARE TRAPPED HERE,

20
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,250
AND I'M NOT ACCEPTING
ANY EXCUSES

21
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,250
FOR YOUR NOT DINING
WITH ME.

22
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,500
Kirk:
WE'D BE DELIGHTED.

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,291
GOVERNOR,
YOU INDICATED ONE
ADDITIONAL INMATE

24
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,333
SINCE
OUR LAST VISIT,

25
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,500
MAKING
A TOTAL OF 15.
IS THAT CORRECT?

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,750
IT IS. THE
REHABILITATION PROGRAM

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,208
ISN'T PROGRESSING
TOO WELL,

28
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,000
AND I HAVE MY DOUBTS

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,500
ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS
OF THIS MEDICINE, TOO.

30
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,583
WHY, DONALD, ARE YOU
BECOMING A PESSIMIST?

31
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,041
[CHUCKLING]
I'M AFRAID I HAVE.

32
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:16,667
A TOTAL OF
15 INCURABLY INSANE
OUT OF BILLIONS

33
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:19,291
IS NOT
WHAT I WOULD CALL
AN EXCESSIVE FIGURE.

34
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,166
WHO IS
THE NEW INMATE?

35
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:21,417
GARTH.

36
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:29,709
GARTH OF IZAR, A FORMER
STARSHIP FLEET CAPTAIN.

37
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:33,250
Kirk: WHEN I WAS A CADET
AT THE ACADEMY,

38
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,500
HIS EXPLOITS
WERE REQUIRED READING.

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,750
HE WAS ONE
OF MY HEROES.

40
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,125
I'D LIKE
TO SEE HIM, DONALD.

41
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:38,750
OF COURSE.

42
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,834
Woman: CAPTAIN,

43
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,792
YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE.

44
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,750
CAPTAIN KIRK
IS PRESSED FOR TIME
AT THE MOMENT, MARTA.

45
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,583
THERE'S NOTHING
THE MATTER WITH ME.

46
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,166
CAN'T YOU SEE
JUST BY LOOKING AT ME?

47
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,291
CAN'T YOU TELL
JUST BY LISTENING?

48
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,417
SHE SOUNDS
RATIONAL ENOUGH,
CAPTAIN.

49
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:16,542
I AM RATIONAL.

50
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:17,667
WELL, WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

51
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,458
I CAN'T TELL YOU
IN FRONT OF HIM.

52
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,917
YOU'RE AFRAID
TO TALK IN FRONT
OF GOVERNOR CORY?

53
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:27,500
HE ISN'T REALLY
GOVERNOR CORY AT ALL.

54
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,709
THAT'S JUST IT.

55
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,083
SHE'S BEEN SAYING
THAT FOR DAYS NOW.

56
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,166
OUR MEDICAL STAFF
CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY.

57
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:51,834
HERE'S GARTH. HE'S BEEN
UNUSUALLY DISTURBED,

58
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:56,417
AND WE'VE HAD TO IMPOSE
ADDITIONAL RESTRAINT.

59
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:56,875
CORY?

60
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:01,250
YES, JIM. I'M CORY.

61
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,125
[LAUGHING MANIACALLY]

62
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,208
IT'S TRUE.
HE TRICKED YOU.

63
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,834
[LAUGHING]

64
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,625
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME, CAPTAIN.

65
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,542
WELL, HERE I AM.

66
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:23,458
HA HA HA!

67
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,917
SPACE:
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

68
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,333
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES OF
THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

69
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,250
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--

70
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,834
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS,

71
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:57,917
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

72
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:01,375
TO BOLDLY GO
WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

73
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,875
YOUR VULCAN FRIEND
IS STILL ALIVE, CAPTAIN.

74
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,750
MY PHASER WAS SET
TO STUN, NOT TO KILL.

75
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,166
HE'LL BE QUITE
COMFORTABLE...

76
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,834
ALMOST AS COMFORTABLE
AS YOU AND OUR
ESTEEMED GOVERNOR.

77
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,125
GARTH, DO YOU
HAVE TO MAKE HIM
SUFFER LIKE THAT?

78
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,542
YOU WILL ADDRESS ME
BY MY PROPER TITLE, KIRK.

79
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:06,208
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE SAID,
"CAPTAIN GARTH."

80
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,959
I AM LORD GARTH,
FORMERLY OF IZAR,

81
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,917
AND I LEAD THE FUTURE
MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE.

82
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:15,917
I'M SORRY, LORD GARTH.

83
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,792
YOU EARTH PEOPLE
ARE A STIFF-NECKED
LOT, AREN'T YOU?

84
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:24,959
RELEASE HIM.

85
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,166
I'M AFRAID THAT
SUBJUGATING YOU
WON'T BE ENOUGH.

86
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,500
YOU MUST BE CONFINED,

87
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,458
AND ALL THE PEOPLE
OF THE GALAXY

88
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,917
WHO WILL NOT BOW
TO MY WILL

89
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,542
MUST BE CONFINED
OR DESTROYED.

90
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:40,583
CAPTAIN GARTH,
LISTEN TO ME.

91
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,917
HO HO!

92
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:45,125
OUR BELOVED GOVERNOR
HAS DECIDED TO ADDRESS US,

93
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,792
AND WE HAVE NOT GIVEN HIM
OUR PERMISSION TO SPEAK.

94
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,834
ARE YOU SO AFRAID
OF HIM THAT YOU MUST
KEEP HIM PINNED?

95
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,083
I'M AFRAID OF NO ONE!

96
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,333
YOU'RE ALL POWERLESS
AGAINST ME.

97
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,750
THANK YOU.

98
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,834
NOW, WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE WITH THE MEDICINE?

99
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,667
THE MEDICINE?
YOU MEAN, THE POISON.

100
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,625
I DESTROYED IT
AT THE PORT.

101
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,959
DESTROYED IT?!
IT WAS YOUR ONLY HOPE.

102
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,166
SILENCE!

103
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,458
THE CHATTER OF INFERIOR
WEAKLINGS WEARIES ME,

104
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,125
AND IT'S TIME I TOOK
COMMAND OF THE "ENTERPRISE."

105
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,166
YOU'LL HELP ME, OF COURSE.

106
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:23,750
[SARCASTICALLY]
OF COURSE.

107
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,250
MY CREW MUTINIED.

108
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,583
THE FIRST USE I WILL MAKE
OF THE "ENTERPRISE"

109
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,875
IS TO HUNT THEM DOWN
AND PUNISH THEM FOR THAT.

110
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,750
THE CREW OF
THE "ENTERPRISE"
WILL ALSO MUTINY.

111
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,333
HEH HEH. BUT THEY WON'T!

112
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:37,917
YOU SEE, CAPTAIN,

113
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,542
THERE'S A HELPFUL
TECHNIQUE I'VE MASTERED.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,959
HA HA HA!

115
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:44,959
HA HA HA!

116
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,125
GOOD-BYE, DARLING.
I'LL MISS YOU.

117
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,959
HA HA HA!

118
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,583
GOVERNOR CORY,
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,041
ALL RIGHT.

120
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,417
THERE IS NO HELP
FOR ANY OF US

121
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:10,458
IF THAT MADMAN
IS IN COMMAND

122
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,041
OF THE "ENTERPRISE."

123
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,959
HE BOASTS
THAT HE'S CREATED

124
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,834
THE MOST
POWERFUL EXPLOSIVE
IN THE UNIVERSE,

125
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,709
AND I BELIEVE HIM.

126
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,291
HOW DOES HE MANAGE
TO CHANGE FORM AT WILL?

127
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,125
THE PEOPLE OF ANTOS
TAUGHT HIM

128
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,834
THE TECHNIQUES
OF CELLULAR
METAMORPHOSIS

129
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:29,250
TO RESTORE
THE DESTROYED PARTS
OF HIS BODY.

130
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,625
BY HIMSELF,
HE LATER LEARNED

131
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,625
TO USE THE TECHNIQUE
TO RE-CREATE HIMSELF

132
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,959
INTO ANY FORM
HE WISHED.

133
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,917
THE FIRST TIME
WE KNEW ABOUT IT

134
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,417
WAS WHEN A GUARD,
SEEING WHAT HE
THOUGHT WAS ME

135
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:44,000
IN GARTH'S CELL,
RELEASED HIM.

136
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,667
HE WAS SUCH A GENIUS.
WHAT A WASTE.

137
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,208
FORCE FIELD'S OFF.
GOOD. REMAIN HERE,
OUT OF SIGHT,

138
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,000
UNTIL I GIVE YOU
THE ORDER TO JOIN ME.

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,583
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

140
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,083
SCOTT HERE, SIR.

141
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,000
BEAM ME ABOARD.

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,625
AYE, SIR. QUEEN
TO QUEEN'S LEVEL 3.

143
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,166
I SAID,
"BEAM ME ABOARD."

144
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,458
I SAID, "QUEEN
TO QUEEN'S LEVEL 3."

145
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,667
WE HAVE NO TIME
FOR CHESS PROBLEMS.

146
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:17,375
BEAM ME ABOARD.

147
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,583
I'M FOLLOWING
YOUR ORDERS, CAPTAIN.

148
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,458
QUEEN
TO QUEEN'S LEVEL 3.

149
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,917
JUST TESTING.

150
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,667
BE IN TOUCH
WITH YOU LATER.

151
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,792
NO!

152
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,625
NO!

153
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,834
NO!

154
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,625
[MOANING]

155
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:50,667
AAH!

156
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,834
AAH!

157
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,000
I GAVE HIM THE SIGN.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,709
WHY DIDN'T HE GIVE ME
THE COUNTERSIGN?

159
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,709
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

160
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,250
USING
THE CHESS PROBLEM

161
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:25,792
WAS THE CAPTAIN'S
OWN SUGGESTION.

162
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:27,959
HE COULDN'T HAVE
FORGOTTEN IT,

163
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:28,542
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE WAS TESTING ME.

164
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:32,208
LIEUTENANT,
REESTABLISH
COMMUNICATION.

165
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:32,500
AYE, SIR.

166
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,458
THERE'S NO RESPONSE,
MR. SCOTT.

167
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,583
SEND AN ARMED
DETAIL

168
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,333
TO THE TRANSPORTER
ROOM IMMEDIATELY.

169
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:41,792
AYE-AYE, SIR.

170
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,458
MR. SULU, WHAT DO
YOUR SENSORS SHOW?

171
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,333
WE CAN'T BEAM
ANYBODY DOWN, SIR.

172
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,375
THE FORCE FIELD
ON THE PLANET

173
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,750
IS IN FULL
OPERATION, AND ALL
FORMS OF TRANSPORT

174
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,000
INTO THE ASYLUM DOME
ARE BLOCKED OFF.

175
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,417
WELL, WE COULD
BLAST OUR WAY

176
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,083
THROUGH THE FIELD,
BUT ONLY AT THE RISK

177
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,291
OF DESTROYING
THE CAPTAIN, MR. SPOCK,

178
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,583
AND ANY OTHER LIVING
THING ON ELBA II.

179
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,959
HOW CAN WE BE
POWERFUL ENOUGH

180
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,417
TO WIPE OUT A PLANET

181
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,166
AND STILL BE
SO HELPLESS?

182
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,875
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE
THE "ENTERPRISE."

183
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,750
DO YOU HEAR ME?

184
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,750
WE ARE GOING TO
TAKE HER,

185
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,709
IF I HAVE TO
SHATTER EVERY BONE

186
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,834
IN CAPTAIN KIRK'S BODY.

187
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:42,834
CAPTAIN!

188
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:45,542
CAPTAIN KIRK!

189
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,000
WELL, I HOPE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN TOO UNCOMFORTABLE,
CAPTAIN.

190
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:52,000
I THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONCERN.

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,834
ALL IN ALL,
IT'S BEEN RATHER RESTFUL.

192
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:57,625
GOOD. STILL, I'M AFRAID
I'VE BEEN QUITE REMISS

193
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,625
IN MY DUTIES
AS YOUR HOST.

194
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,166
BUT I DID INVITE YOU
DOWN TO DINNER,
AS YOU MAY RECALL.

195
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:02,208
I'VE FORGOTTEN.

196
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,000
BUT I HAVEN'T.

197
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,375
YOU AND MR. SPOCK
ARE TO BE MY GUESTS.

198
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,709
WHERE IS MR. SPOCK?

199
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,291
RIGHT HERE.
MARTA!

200
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,291
WHY CAN'T I
BLOW OFF JUST ONE
OF HIS EARS?

201
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:22,750
STOP THAT, MARTA.

202
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,000
MR. SPOCK WILL
THINK WE'RE LACKING
IN HOSPITALITY.

203
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,709
WON'T YOU JOIN US,
CAPTAIN?

204
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,166
HOW ARE YOU,
MR. SPOCK?

205
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:32,959
VERY WELL, INDEED.
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

206
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,417
ISN'T GOVERNOR CORY
JOINING US?

207
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,333
NO. THE GOVERNOR
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
ON THE GUEST LIST.

208
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,583
OH? AN OVERSIGHT?

209
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:41,208
AN INTENTIONAL ONE.

210
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,417
THE GOVERNOR'S
FASTING.

211
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:45,083
IN THAT CASE,
WE MUST DECLINE
WITH THANKS.

212
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:46,333
UH, CAPTAIN...

213
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,250
DON'T BE A FOOL, JIM.
GO ALONG WITH HIM.

214
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:52,792
GOOD ADVICE,
GOVERNOR.

215
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:54,875
WELL, CAPTAIN?

216
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,834
YOU'LL FIND WE SET
A HANDSOME TABLE,

217
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:01,750
AND THE
ENTERTAINMENT
IS MOST ENJOYABLE.

218
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,625
YOU'RE VERY
PERSUASIVE.

219
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:06,625
YES, I AM.

220
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:08,959
I CERTAINLY AM.

221
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,709
HYAH!

222
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,583
KEEP YOUR HANDS
OFF KIRK!

223
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,750
YOU TREACHEROUS
THING.

224
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,792
HA HA HA!

225
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,166
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

226
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,667
I AM ABOVE
THAT SORT OF THING.

227
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:39,959
THE CAPTAIN IS ANNOYED
BY YOUR ATTENTIONS,
THAT'S ALL.

228
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,208
AM I ANNOYING YOU,
DEAREST?

229
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,250
WELL, NOT REALLY.

230
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,750
HA HA! HE FINDS ME
FASCINATING,

231
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,709
AND YOU'RE
BOTHERED BY IT.

232
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:49,667
ADMIT IT.

233
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:50,792
I MAY HAVE YOU
BEATEN TO DEATH.

234
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,834
NO, YOU WON'T,

235
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:57,125
BECAUSE I AM
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN ON THIS PLANET.

236
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,208
YOU'RE THE ONLY WOMAN
ON THIS PLANET,
YOU STUPID COW.

237
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,792
WELL, I'M THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
IN THIS GALAXY.

238
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:03,542
YOU'RE REPULSIVE.

239
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,417
Marta: I'M BEAUTIFUL!

240
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,166
AND I'M
INTELLIGENT, TOO.

241
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,625
I WRITE POETRY,

242
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,083
AND I PAINT
MARVELOUS PICTURES,

243
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,667
AND I AM
A WONDERFUL DANCER.

244
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,834
LIES. ALL LIES!

245
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,959
YOU ARE THE GREATEST LIAR
I HAVE EVER MET!

246
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:23,917
LET ME HEAR ONE POEM
YOU'VE WRITTEN.

247
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:28,083
IF YOU LIKE.

248
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,500
Spock:
CAPTAIN, IF YOU COULD
CREATE A DIVERSION,

249
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,834
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND
THE CONTROL ROOM

250
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,291
AND OPEN
THE FORCE FIELD.

251
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,875
ALL WE NEED
IS A FEW SECONDS,

252
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,083
BECAUSE SCOTTY HAS ALERTED
THE SECURITY DETAIL.

253
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,125
GENTLEMEN, COURTESY
FOR THE PERFORMER.

254
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,667
SHALL I COMPARE THEE
TO A SUMMER'S DAY?

255
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:49,375
THOU ART MORE LOVELY
AND MORE TEMPERATE.

256
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,625
ROUGH WINDS DO SHAKE
THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY,

257
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,542
AND SUMMER'S LEASE
HATH ALL--

258
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,291
YOU WROTE THAT?!

259
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,000
YESTERDAY,
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,125
IT WAS WRITTEN
BY AN EARTHMAN
NAMED SHAKESPEARE

261
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,542
A LONG TIME AGO.

262
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,542
WHICH DOES NOT
ALTER THE FACT

263
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:05,291
THAT I WROTE IT
AGAIN YESTERDAY.

264
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:09,083
I THINK IT'S ONE
OF MY BEST POEMS,

265
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,625
DON'T YOU?

266
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,750
I MAY KILL YOU
WITH MY BARE HANDS!

267
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,917
ACTUALLY, CAPTAIN,
SHE IS A SUPERB DANCER.

268
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:23,083
MARTA, MY DEAR,
WON'T YOU DANCE
FOR OUR GUESTS?

269
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:28,083
THAT WAS NOT
A REQUEST.

270
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,166
[GONG SOUNDS]

271
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,917
[MUSIC PLAYING]

272
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,166
MARVELOUS,
ISN'T SHE, CAPTAIN?

273
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,792
YES. UM...INCREDIBLE.

274
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:58,542
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION,
MR. SPOCK?

275
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,583
WELL, I FIND
IT, UM...

276
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,667
MILDLY INTERESTING
AND SOMEWHAT NOSTALGIC,

277
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,000
IF I UNDERSTAND
THE USE OF THAT WORD.

278
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,500
NOSTALGIC?

279
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,667
YES, IT IS SOMEWHAT
REMINISCENT

280
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,750
OF THE DANCES THAT
VULCAN CHILDREN DO

281
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,250
IN NURSERY SCHOOL.

282
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,959
OF COURSE, THE CHILDREN
ARE NOT SO...

283
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,333
WELL-COORDINATED.

284
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,166
[APPLAUSE]

285
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,667
SHE'S YOURS
IF YOU WISH, CAPTAIN.

286
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,125
OH, UH...
THANK YOU.

287
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,834
THAT'S, UM...

288
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:35,750
VERY MAGNANIMOUS
OF YOU.

289
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,083
WELL, YOU'LL FIND
THAT I AM MAGNANIMOUS...

290
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,792
TO MY FRIENDS
AND MERCILESS
TO MINE ENEMIES.

291
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,792
AND I WANT YOU,
BOTH OF YOU,
TO BE MY FRIENDS.

292
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,875
ON WHAT, PRECISELY,

293
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,625
IS OUR FRIENDSHIP
TO BE BASED?

294
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,917
WELL, UPON THE FIRMEST
OF FOUNDATIONS, MR. SPOCK:

295
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,208
ENLIGHTENED
SELF-INTEREST.

296
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,166
YOU, CAPTAIN,
ARE SECOND ONLY TO ME

297
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,667
AS THE FINEST MILITARY
COMMANDER IN THE GALAXY.

298
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,417
Kirk: THAT'S
VERY FLATTERING.

299
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,917
I...AM PRIMARILY
AN EXPLORER NOW,

300
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:12,375
CAPTAIN GARTH.

301
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,667
AND SO HAVE I BEEN.

302
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,834
I HAVE CHARTED
MORE NEW WORLDS

303
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,750
THAN ANY MAN
IN HISTORY.

304
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,208
AND TRIED TO DESTROY
ANTOS IV.

305
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,625
WHY?

306
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,000
WELL, I COULD SAY
BECAUSE THEY WERE

307
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
ACTIVELY HOSTILE
TO THE FEDERATION.

308
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,458
YES, YOU COULD SAY,
BUT THAT WOULD
BE UNTRUE.

309
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:28,333
AGREED.

310
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,959
ACTUALLY, THEY WERE
QUITE HARMLESS,

311
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,208
AND THEY MADE ME WHOLE

312
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,792
WHEN I WAS MAIMED
AND DYING.

313
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:36,750
AND IN MY GRATITUDE,

314
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,750
I OFFERED THEM
THE GALAXY.

315
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,083
THEY REJECTED ME,
AND I CONDEMNED
THEM TO DEATH.

316
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,834
HOW COULD YOU,
A STARSHIP FLEET
CAPTAIN,

317
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:46,792
BELIEVE THAT
A FEDERATION CREW

318
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,375
WOULD BLINDLY OBEY
YOUR ORDER

319
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,625
TO DESTROY THE ENTIRE
ANTOS RACE,

320
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,583
A PEOPLE FAMOUS
FOR THEIR BENEVOLENCE

321
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,125
AND PEACEFUL PURSUITS?

322
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,792
THAT WAS MY ONLY
MISCALCULATION.

323
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,041
I HAD CHANGED.

324
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,166
I HAD RISEN ABOVE
THIS DECADENT WEAKNESS,

325
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,166
WHICH STILL HAS YOU
IN ITS COMMAND,

326
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,542
BY THE WAY, CAPTAIN.

327
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,208
MY CREW HAD NOT.

328
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,834
I COULDN'T SWAY THEM.

329
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:11,709
BUT MY NEW CREW,
YOU MET IN THIS ROOM,

330
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,458
WILL OBEY MY ORDERS
WITHOUT QUESTION.

331
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,625
GENTLEMEN,
YOU HAVE EYES,

332
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,792
BUT YOU CANNOT SEE.

333
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,375
GALAXIES SURROUND US,

334
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,542
LIMITLESS VISTAS,

335
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:27,417
AND YET THE FEDERATION
WOULD HAVE US

336
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,750
DRUM AWAY LIKE SOME ANTS

337
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,667
ON SOME...SOMEWHAT LARGER
THAN USUAL ANTHILL.

338
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,166
BUT I AM NOT AN INSECT.

339
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,959
I AM MASTER
OF THE UNIVERSE,

340
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,709
AND I MUST CLAIM
MY DOMAIN.

341
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:43,125
I AGREE THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN WAR WAS NECESSARY,

342
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,083
AND YOU WERE
OUR GREATEST WARRIOR.

343
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,542
I STUDIED
YOUR VICTORY AT AXENAR
WHEN I WAS A CADET.

344
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,583
IN FACT, IT'S STILL
REQUIRED READING
AT THE ACADEMY.

345
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:51,959
AS WELL IT SHOULD BE.

346
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,917
VERY WELL. BUT MY FIRST
VISIT TO AXENAR

347
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,959
WAS AS A NEW-FLEDGED CADET
ON A PEACE MISSION.

348
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,458
PEACE MISSION!
POLITICIANS AND WEAKLINGS!

349
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,500
THEY WERE HUMANITARIANS
AND STATESMEN,

350
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,125
AND THEY HAD A DREAM,

351
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,542
A DREAM THAT BECAME
A REALITY

352
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,500
AND SPREAD THROUGHOUT
THE STARS,

353
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,125
A DREAM THAT MADE
MR. SPOCK AND ME BROTHERS.

354
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,625
MR. SPOCK!

355
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,000
YOU CONSIDER CAPTAIN KIRK
AND YOURSELF BROTHERS?

356
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,917
CAPTAIN KIRK SPEAKS
SOMEWHAT FIGURATIVELY

357
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,625
AND WITH UNDUE EMOTION.

358
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,000
HOWEVER, WHAT HE SAYS
IS LOGICAL,

359
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,041
AND I DO, IN FACT,
AGREE WITH IT.

360
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:34,291
BLIND! TRULY BLIND.

361
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,417
CAPTAIN KIRK IS
YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER!

362
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:39,500
YOU ARE HIS SUBORDINATE,
AND THAT IS ALL.

363
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,458
YET, MR. SPOCK, YOU
ARE A WORTHY COMMANDER

364
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,375
IN YOUR OWN RIGHT,

365
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,375
AND IN MY FLEET,
YOU WILL SURELY HAVE

366
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,667
A STARSHIP TO COMMAND.

367
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,458
PLEASE FORGIVE ME,

368
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,917
BUT EXACTLY WHERE
IS YOUR FLEET?

369
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,041
OUT THERE

370
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,333
WAITING FOR ME.

371
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,917
THEY WILL FLOCK
TO MY CAUSE,

372
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,625
AND FOR GOOD REASON--

373
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,834
LIMITLESS POWER,

374
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,917

375
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,750
AND SOLAR SYSTEMS
RULED BY THE ELITE.

376
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,000
WE, GENTLEMEN,
ARE THAT ELITE,

377
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,917
AND WE MUST TAKE
WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY OURS

378
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,250
FROM THE DECADENT
WEAKLINGS THAT NOW HOLD IT.

379

380
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,041
LORD GARTH.

381
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,917
AS YOU WISH.
AT ANY RATE,

382
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:25,542
YOU MUST BE AWARE
OF THE FACT

383
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:28,083
THAT YOU
ARE ATTEMPTING
TO RE-CREATE

384
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,083
THE DISASTER
WHICH RESULTED

385
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,500
IN YOUR BECOMING
AN INMATE
IN THIS PLACE.

386
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,834
I WAS BETRAYED
AND TREATED BARBARICALLY.

387
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,208
ON THE CONTRARY.
YOU WERE TREATED
WITH JUSTICE

388
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,125
AND WITH COMPASSION,
WHICH YOU
FAILED TO SHOW

389
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,875
TOWARDS ANY
OF YOUR INTENDED
VICTIMS.

390
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,750
LOGICALLY,
THEREFORE, ONE
MUST ASSUME--

391
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,583

392
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:56,250

SOME OF THIS WINE,

IT HAS A ROBUST,
FULL-BODIED FLAVOR,

394
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,583

YOU'LL FIND DIVERTING.

I PREFER TO JOIN
MR. SPOCK.

THAT YOU REMAIN HERE.

DIVERTISSEMENT ENCHANTING,

00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,125
DIDN'T WE, CAPTAIN?

400
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,375
BUT THERE'S MUCH,
MUCH MORE TO COME.

HAS MERELY BEGUN.

I ASSUME YOU PLAY CHESS.

SO DO I. HOW WOULD
YOU RESPOND TO QUEEN
TO QUEEN'S LEVEL 3?

YOU'RE AWARE

IN ONLY ONE.

408
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,291
I CAN'T,
FOR THE LIFE OF ME,
IMAGINE WHICH ONE.

409
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,875
"FOR THE LIFE
OF ME" IS A PHRASE
WELL-CHOSEN, CAPTAIN.

COME TO THAT.

AND THE ANGER IN THE SKY.

00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,959

THIS MORNING.

BEFORE YOU, CAPTAIN,

QUITE ORDINARY
IN APPEARANCE.

ALMOST PRIMITIVE,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:45,333
YES, I RECOGNIZE IT.

435
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,458

OF THE REHABILITATION

QUITE PAINLESS,

00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:52,083
TO DO THAT.

520
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,959
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

521
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,542
OH, YES, IT IS.

522
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:59,583
IT IS IF I CAN GET
TO THE CONTROL ROOM

523
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:02,625
AND REMOVE
THE FORCE FIELD.

524
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,291
THEN GARTH
IS FINISHED.

525
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,166
GARTH IS MY LEADER.

526
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,542
HE WILL LEAD YOU
TO DESTRUCTION.

527
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:13,208
HE'S ALREADY DESTROYED

528
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,458
THE MEDICINE THAT
COULD HAVE HELPED YOU.

529
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:20,000
BUT THERE'S
MORE MEDICINE
ABOARD THE SHIP.

530
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,834
I'LL HELP YOU,
BUT YOU MUST WAIT.

531
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:25,625
YOU DO SEE THAT,
DON'T YOU?

532
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,166
SOON, YOUR FRIEND SPOCK
WILL BE HERE, AND THEN--

533
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,291
SPOCK!

534
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,000
AT LEAST I'VE
ARRANGED THAT MUCH.

535
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,375
HOW DID YOU
MANAGE THAT?

536
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:37,000
A CONVINCING LIE
TOLD TO A GUARD

537
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,333
WHO FINDS ME...
DESIRABLE.

538
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,000
DARLING...

539
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:06,208
NO, NO.
YOU MUSTN'T STOP ME.

540
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:09,333
HE'S MY LOVER,
AND I HAVE TO KILL HIM.

541
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,417
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE
WORKED OUT

542
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:18,709
AN INFALLIBLE METHOD

543
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,625
FOR ENSURING PERMANENT
MALE FIDELITY.

544
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,125
INTERESTING.

545
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,875
I'M VERY GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

546
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,959
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.
WE'RE NOW ARMED.

547
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,417
I PRESUME WE SHALL
TRY TO REACH
THE CONTROL ROOM.

548
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:29,041
YES, YOU PRESUME
CORRECTLY.

549
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,166
THE FORCE FIELD
IS NOW OFF, CAPTAIN.

550
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,834
KIRK TO
"ENTERPRISE."

551
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:24,125
KIRK
TO "ENTERPRISE."

552
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:26,083
MR. SCOTT,
IT'S THE CAPTAIN.

553
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,875
SCOTT HERE, CAPTAIN.

554
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,667
YOU HAD US WORRIED.

555
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,959
MR. SCOTT, I WANT
A FULLY-ARMED
SECURITY DETAIL

556
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,792
BEAMED DOWN HERE
ON THE DOUBLE.

557
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,375
THEY'RE ALREADY
IN THE TRANSPORTER
ROOM, SIR.

558
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:40,875
AND HAVE DR. McCOY
PREPARE ADDITIONAL
MEDICINE

559
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,291
AS QUICKLY
AS POSSIBLE.

560
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:43,834
AYE-AYE, SIR.

561
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:46,166
CAPTAIN, I SUGGEST
YOU RETURN TO
THE SHIP AT ONCE.

562
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,083
YOUR SAFETY IS VITAL
TO THE "ENTERPRISE."

563
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,208
Scott: WAITING FOR
YOUR ORDER, CAPTAIN.

564
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:52,166
I ALSO REQUEST PERMISSION
TO REMAIN HERE

565
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:54,417
IN CHARGE OF
THE SECURITY TEAM
YOU BEAM DOWN.

566
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:55,583
VERY WELL.

567
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,125
STILL WAITING,
CAPTAIN.

568
00:30:57,125 --> 00:31:00,500
MR. SCOTT,
THE CAPTAIN'S LIFE
IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER.

569
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,208
BEAM HIM ABOARD
AT ONCE.

570
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,458
THE SECURITY TEAM
WILL BE ENTRUSTED TO ME.

571
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,917
QUEEN TO QUEEN'S
LEVEL 3. REPEAT.

572
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:10,208
QUEEN TO
QUEEN'S LEVEL 3.

573
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,500
HE'S WAITING FOR
THE PROPER REPLY, CAPTAIN.

574
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,583
Scott: GIVE THE
COUNTERSIGN AS ORDERED.

575
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:23,834
SCOTTY, MR. SPOCK
WILL GIVE
THE COUNTERSIGN.

576
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:31,417
GIVE HIM THE COUNTERSIGN,
CAPTAIN.

577
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:35,250
Scotty: SECURITY DETAIL,
STAND BY TO BEAM DOWN.

578
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,375
BLAST AWAY, CAPTAIN,
IF YOU CAN.

579
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,250
YOU THINK
I'M FOOL ENOUGH

580
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,041
TO GIVE YOU
A CHARGED PHASER?

581
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:58,917
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH SPOCK?

582
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,250
WHERE IS HE?

583
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,291
I HAVE DONE NOTHING
WITH HIM AS OF YET,

584
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:04,458
BUT I DO HAVE
PLANS FOR HIM.

585
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,291
THE VULCAN WILL DIE
RATHER HORRIBLY,

586
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,125
AND HIS DEATH WILL BE
ON YOUR CONSCIENCE.

587
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:15,166
CAPTAIN GARTH--

588
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,458
LORD GARTH!

589
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,542
NO, SIR.

590
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:19,959
CAPTAIN GARTH.

591
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,125
STARSHIP FLEET CAPTAIN.

592
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:25,750
THAT'S
AN HONORABLE TITLE.

593
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,834
AND I WAS THE GREATEST
OF THEM ALL, WASN'T I?

594
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,000
YES, YOU WERE.

595
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,083
YES.

596
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,625
BUT YOU'RE
A SICK MAN NOW, SIR.

597
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,750
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
MORE HEALTHY.

598
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,083
NO. NO, THINK.

599
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,875
THINK BACK
TO WHAT YOU WERE

600
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,792
BEFORE THE ACCIDENT

601
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:48,750
THAT SENT YOU
TO ANTOS IV.

602
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,875
TRY.

603
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,125
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

604
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,625
IT'S ALMOST
AS IF I HAD DIED

605
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,041
AND WAS REBORN.

606
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,333
NO, I...
I CAN REMEMBER.

607
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:03,375
YOU...

608
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:06,709
WERE THE FINEST STUDENT
AT THE ACADEMY,

609
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:09,083
THE FINEST
STARSHIP CAPTAIN.

610
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,375
YOU WERE
THE PROTOTYPE,

611
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:12,583
THE MODEL
FOR THE REST OF US.

612
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,583
YES. I DO
REMEMBER THAT.

613
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,583
IT WAS A GREAT
RESPONSIBILITY,

614
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,375
BUT ONE I WAS
PROUD TO BEAR.

615
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,709
AND YOU BORE IT
WELL.

616
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,792
AND THE...DISEASE

617
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,917
THAT CHANGED YOU...

618
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:32,542
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

619
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:35,625
AND THE TERRIBLE THINGS
YOU DID SINCE THEN,

620
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,208
YOU'RE NOT TRULY
RESPONSIBLE.

621
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,750
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ANYMORE.

622
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,250
YOU'RE WEAK,
AND YOU'RE TRYING

623
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,709
TO DRAIN ME
OF MY STRENGTH.

624
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,041
NO, I'M NOT.

625
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,875
I WANT YOU TO FIND
WHAT YOU ONCE HAD.

626
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,625
I WANT YOU TO GO BACK
TO THE GREATNESS

627
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,000
THAT YOU'VE LOST,
CAPTAIN GARTH.

628
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I AM LORD GARTH,

629
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,917
MASTER
OF THE UNIVERSE.

630
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:54,792
YOU DOUBT ME ONLY
BECAUSE I HAVE NOT,

631
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,792
AS OF YET,
HAD MY CORONATION.

632
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:58,875
NO, SIR,
LISTEN TO ME, I--

633
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:01,333
STOP!

634
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:01,667
ON YOUR KNEES.

635
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:02,875
NO.

636
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,333
ON YOUR KNEES
BEFORE ME!

637
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:08,333
ALL THE OTHERS
BEFORE ME
HAVE FAILED.

638
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:11,375
ALEXANDER, CAESAR,
NAPOLEON, HITLER,

639
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:13,959
LEE KWAN, CROTUS.

640
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,917
ALL OF THEM
ARE DUST!

641
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:20,166
BUT I WILL TRIUMPH.

642
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,625
I WILL MAKE...

643
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:23,458
THE ULTIMATE
CONQUEST.

644
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,125
THE THRONE
MUST BE HIGHER...

645
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,000
IT MUST BE HIGHER

646
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,125
THAN ANYTHING ELSE
IN THIS ROOM.

647
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:52,917
HMM...USE THAT TABLE
AS A PEDESTAL.

648
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:55,250
AH, WELCOME BACK,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

649
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,959
I'M GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT
FOR THE CORONATION.

650
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:59,291
CORONATION?

651
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:02,375
YES. OH, I KNOW
THAT EVEN A REAL THRONE

652
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:04,709
IS NO MORE
THAN MERELY A CHAIR,

653
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:07,125
BUT THE SYMBOLISM
IS IMPORTANT,
DON'T YOU AGREE?

654
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:08,583
YES, I AGREE.

655
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:10,959
YOU'LL WEAR A CROWN,
TOO, I PRESUME?

656
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,250
THEN AGAIN,
JUST AS A TOKEN.

657
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,417
NOT IMPRESSIVE
IN ITSELF, BUT...

658
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:16,083
IT WILL SERVE
AS A STANDARD

659
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,291
AROUND WHICH
OUR FOLLOWERS WILL RALLY.

660
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:20,583
GARTH, YOU HAVE
ONLY A HANDFUL OF MEN.

661
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:23,458
YOU DO REFUSE
TO ENTER INTO
THE SPIRIT OF THE THING,

662
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,000
DON'T YOU, CAPTAIN?

663
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,792
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
A LARGER ROLE
IN THE CEREMONY.

664
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,375
YOU COULD SERVE
AS HUMAN SACRIFICE,
FOR EXAMPLE.

665
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,709
NO, I WOULDN'T
ENJOY THAT AT ALL.

666
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:34,625
BESIDES, YOU SEEM
TO NEED ME ALIVE.

667
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,333
AH, TRUE.

668
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:39,000
ALL RIGHT. UH...

669
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,542
HOW ABOUT
CROWN PRINCE?

670
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,750
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU
OUR HEIR APPARENT.

671
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,125
HEIR APPARENT,
I BELIEVE,

672
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:44,667
IS THE PROPER ROLE
FOR YOU.

673
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:47,542
BESIDES, WE HAVE
OTHER CANDIDATES

674
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:49,792
FOR OUR HUMAN
SACRIFICE, HMM?

675
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:51,417
WHO KNOWS?

676
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:52,959
READY.

677
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,166
WELL, SINCE THERE IS
NO ONE MIGHTY ENOUGH

678
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,959
TO PERFORM
THIS CEREMONY,

679
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:25,166
WE'LL PERFORM IT
OURSELVES.

680
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:29,250
THEREFORE, WE HEREBY
PROCLAIM THAT I AM

681
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,291
LORD GARTH,
MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE.

682
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:37,125
AND WE DESIGNATE
OUR BELOVED MARTA

683
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,792
TO BE OUR CONSORT.

684
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:48,250
AND WE FURTHER DESIGNATE
CAPTAIN JAMES KIRK

685
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,917
OF THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE"

686
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:51,667
TO BE OUR HEIR APPARENT.

687
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,625
[APPLAUSE]

688
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:19,917
AND NOW REMOVE
OUR HEIR APPARENT

689
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:22,083
THAT WE MAY CONCLUDE
THIS CEREMONY.

690
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:44,166
LISTEN TO ME.

691
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,750
THIS MAY BE
OUR LAST CHANCE--

692
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:50,166
GARTH WILL DESTROY
ALL OF US

693
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,709
UNLESS YOU HELP ME
STOP HIM.

694
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:53,291
AND HE'S USING YOU,
YOU KNOW,

695
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:55,375
BECAUSE HE WANTS
THE POWER FOR HIMSELF.

696
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:58,125
I BROUGHT SOMETHING
DOWN HERE THAT MIGHT
HAVE CURED YOU,

697
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,834
BUT HE DESTROYED IT.

698
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:01,375
IF I CAN GET
A PATROL DOWN HERE,

699
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:02,792
THEY'D BRING SOME MORE
OF THAT MEDICINE DOWN HERE--

700
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:04,041
OH!

701
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:10,417
WELL DONE.

702
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,875
WELL, CAPTAIN,
YOU CONTINUE TO RESIST.

703
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:18,333
HOW STUPID OF YOU.

704
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:21,125
PUT HIM IN THAT CHAIR
RIGHT HERE.

705
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,041
I'VE ARRANGED
A SMALL ENTERTAINMENT.

706
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:25,583
I WOULDN'T WANT HIM
TO MISS ANY OF IT.

707
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:35,625
WELL, CAPTAIN,
EVEN YOU MUST ADMIT
THAT I'M A GENIUS.

708
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:38,625
WHAT YOU SEE HERE
IS MY LATEST INVENTION.

709
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,875
THIS IS AN EXPLOSIVE,

710
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:43,750
THE MOST POWERFUL ONE
IN HISTORY.

711
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,542
IF I WERE TO DROP
THIS FLASK,

712
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:48,166
THE RESULTING EXPLOSION

713
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:49,709
WOULD VAPORIZE
THIS PLANET.

714
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,583
NOW DO YOU SEE
WHY IT IS RIDICULOUS

715
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,709
FOR YOU TO RESIST ME,
CAPTAIN?

716
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,125
WELL,
PERHAPS YOU REQUIRE

717
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:01,500
THE DEMONSTRATION
I'VE ARRANGED.

718
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:05,917
WATCH CLOSELY.

719
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:06,834
NOW, IT IS TRUE

720
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:10,333
THAT SHE IS DEADLY
AS A POISONOUS SERPENT,

721
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:13,125
BUT SHE IS ALSO
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

722
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:16,083
AND YOU HAVE HELD HER
IN YOUR ARMS, CAPTAIN.

723
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,458
I'VE ORDERED MY MEN
TO DRIVE HER OUT

724
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,041
OF THE PROTECTIVE DOME.

725
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,625
AND, OF COURSE,
SHE WOULD CHOKE TO DEATH

726
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:27,709
ON THE OUTSIDE
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES,

727
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:29,125
BUT I'VE ARRANGED

728
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,750
A MORE MERCIFUL END
FOR HER.

729
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,417
BECAUSE AFTER ALL,
CAPTAIN.

730
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:35,166
SHE IS MY CONSORT.

731
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,208
ONE TINY CRYSTAL

732
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,333
IMPLANTED
IN HER NECKLACE--

733
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:43,083
A PORTION
OF THIS EXPLOSIVE

734
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,250
NO BIGGER
THAN A GRAIN OF SAND.

735
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,083
I PROPOSE TO DETONATE
IT FROM HERE.

736
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,250
OH, POOR GIRL.

737
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:05,917
POOR DEAR,
SUFFERING CHILD.

738
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,625
I WILL HELP HER...

739
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,208
NOW.

740
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,041
THERE'S BEEN
AN EXPLOSION
ON ELBA II.

741
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,750
0.95!

742
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,917
MUST HAVE WIPED OUT
EVERYTHING.

743
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:34,291
IMMEDIATE PROBE.

744
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:36,458
IS THE FORCE FIELD
IN PLACE, MR. SULU?

745
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,083
YES, SIR.
SOLIDLY.

746
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,917
LIFE CONTINUES TO EXIST
ON THE PLANET.

747
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:42,834
GOT TO BREAK
THROUGH IT SOMEHOW.

748
00:40:42,834 --> 00:40:45,208
DOCTOR, I TOLD YOU
WE COULDN'T DO IT

749
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:48,333
WITHOUT KILLING EVERYONE
IN THE ASYLUM DOME.

750
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,709
I KNOW IT, SCOTTY.

751
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:51,250
WELL...

752
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,875
THERE'S ONE LAST THING
WE MIGHT TRY.

753
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:54,959
PERHAPS THE SHIP'S
PHASERS

754
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,917
CAN CUT
THROUGH A SECTION
OF THE FORCE FIELD

755
00:40:56,917 --> 00:40:58,458
AT ITS WEAKEST POINT.

756
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,625
WHERE DID YOU SAY
THAT WAS LOCATED,
MR. SULU?

757
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,750
ON THE FAR SIDE
OF THE PLANET,
MR. SCOTT.

758
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,750
WILL IT LEAVE
A MARGIN OF SAFETY
FOR THE PEOPLE BELOW?

759
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,375
Sulu: YES, SIR.

760
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:07,333
PREPARE TO CHANGE
ORBITAL PATH, MR. SULU.

761
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,959
ORBITAL COORDINATES
RELEASED, SIR.

762
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,500
BREAK
SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT.

763
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,959
COME TO COURSE 1-4,
MARK 6-8.

764
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:22,083
COURSE 1-4,
MARK 6-8.

765
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,917
SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT
REESTABLISHED, SIR.

766
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,583
SHIP'S PHASERS
TO NARROW BEAM.

767
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,250
SHIP'S PHASERS
READY, SIR.

768
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,458
LET'S PUNCH A HOLE
IN IT. FULL POWER.

769
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,208
ANOTHER BLAST.
FULL POWER.

770
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,500
FORCE FIELD
STILL HOLDING, SIR.

771
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:47,917
HERE.

772
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,792
HA HA HA!

773
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:57,834
HOW ARE YOUR
NERVES, KIRK?

774
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:59,750
ALL I CAN SAY,
GARTH,

775
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,542
IF IT HAPPENS TO ME,
IT HAPPENS TO YOU.

776
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:03,875
YOU'RE AN EXTRAORDINARY
FELLOW, KIRK.

777
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:08,625
YOUR STUBBORNNESS
DEFIES ALL LOGIC.

778
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,125
LOGIC...

779
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,250
THAT IS THE KEY.

780
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:15,333
YOUR FRIEND SPOCK
IS A LOGICAL MAN...

781
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:18,542
A VERY LOGICAL MAN.

782
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,667
GO AND BRING THE VULCAN
HERE TO ME.

783
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:31,333
SPOCK IS NOT ONLY

784
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,125
A MORE LOGICAL MAN
THAN YOU, CAPTAIN.

785
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:33,917
HE'S A MORE
INTELLIGENT ONE,

786
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:34,208
I'M SURE.

787
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:38,750
I SHALL ESTABLISH
A RAPPORT WITH HIM.

788
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:39,750
[BEEP BEEP BEEP]

789
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:51,959
FASCINATING.

790
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:57,208
YOUR VULCAN FRIEND IS
A VERY INGENIOUS FELLOW.

791
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:58,375
THIS COULD BE
MOST AMUSING.

792
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:09,125
THAT'S GARTH.
STUN HIM.

793
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:11,166
HOLD IT, SPOCK.
THAT'S GARTH.

794
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:21,959
LOOK AT ME
CAREFULLY, SPOCK.

795
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,000
CAN'T YOU TELL
I'M YOUR CAPTAIN?

796
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,917
QUEEN TO QUEEN'S
LEVEL 3.

797
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:27,458
I WON'T ANSWER THAT.

798
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,625
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE WANTS TO KNOW.

799
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,083
VERY CLEVER, GARTH.

800
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,583
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY.

801
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:36,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

802
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,959
ARRANGING TO BEAM DOWN
A SECURITY TEAM.

803
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:40,375
ARE THERE
ANY OBJECTIONS?

804
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,792
YES. THEY MAY
WALK INTO A TRAP.

805
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:47,166
THAT'S RIGHT.
GARTH CAN DESTROY US.

806
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:50,875
FASCINATING.

807
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:50,792
WHAT MANEUVER DID WE USE TO
DEFEAT THE

808
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,417
ROMAN VESSEL NEAR TAU
CETI?

809
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:57,667
VERY GOOD, SPOCK.

810
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,333
THE COCHRANE
DECELERATION.

811
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,125
SPOCK...

812
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:03,917
YOU KNOW THE COCHRANE
DECELERATION'S

813
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:05,291
A CLASSIC
BATTLE MANEUVER.

814
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:06,959
EVERY STARSHIP CAPTAIN
KNOWS THAT.

815
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:10,083
AGREED, CAPTAIN...

816
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:13,458
CAPTAINS.

817
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,417
GENTLEMEN, WHICHEVER
ONE OF YOU

818
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:19,583
IS CAPTAIN GARTH

819
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,625
MUST AT THIS MOMENT
BE EXPENDING

820
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,333
A GREAT DEAL OF ENERGY

821
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:24,959
TO MAINTAIN THE IMAGE
OF CAPTAIN KIRK.

822
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:26,542
THAT ENERGY LEVEL

823
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:28,959
CANNOT BE MAINTAINED
INDEFINITELY,

824
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,542
AND I HAVE TIME.

825
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:25,166
I'M YOUR CAPTAIN,
SPOCK.

826
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:26,875
CAN'T YOU TELL?
SHOOT! SHOOT!

827
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,250
HE'S RIGHT, SPOCK.
YOU MUST SHOOT,

828
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,792
BUT YOU MUST SHOOT
BOTH OF US.

829
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:34,667
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO ENSURE THE SAFETY
OF THE "ENTERPRISE."

830
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:49,041
CAPTAIN KIRK,
I PRESUME.

831
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:51,875
MR. SPOCK.

832
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,667
SPOCK TO "ENTERPRISE."

833
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,792
Scott:
"ENTERPRISE" HERE.

834
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:02,917
QUEEN TO QUEEN'S
LEVEL 3.

835
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:04,166
QUEEN TO KING'S
LEVEL ONE.

836
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:10,625
WILL INTRAMUSCULAR
INJECTION BE
SATISFACTORY?

837
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,375
INTRAVENOUS
IS INDICATED,

838
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:14,709
UNLESS CIRCUMSTANCES
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE.

839
00:47:14,709 --> 00:47:16,291
HOW LONG BEFORE
IT TAKES EFFECT,
DR. McCOY?

840
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,375
REVERSAL OF ARTERIAL
AND BRAIN DAMAGE

841
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:23,000
SHOULD BEGIN
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.

842
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,417
[SOFT HUMMING]

843
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,458
[HUMMING STOPS]

844
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:38,750
Kirk: CAPTAIN GARTH,

845
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,375
I'M JAMES KIRK.

846
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:44,750
I'M MR. SPOCK,

847
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,125
SCIENCE OFFICER
ON A STARSHIP.

848
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,291
THE STARSHIP
"ENTERPRISE."

849
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:52,291
STARSHIP...

850
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:55,583
STARSHIP.

851
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,917
YES, SIR.
THE "ENTERPRISE."

852
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,542
I'M THE CAPTAIN.

853
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:11,667
CAN I HELP YOU?

854
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:13,000
NO, CAPTAIN.

855
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,291
THE MEDICINE SEEMS
TO BE TAKING EFFECT.

856
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:16,792
I CAN MANAGE.

857
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:17,083
IT'S VERY
ENCOURAGING.

858
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,083
SHOULD I KNOW YOU, SIR?

859
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:31,375
NO...

860
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,834
CAPTAIN. NO.

861
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,959
MR. SPOCK?

862
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,625
YES, CAPTAIN.

863
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:43,959
TELL ME SOMETHING.

864
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:45,583
WHY WAS IT
SO IMPOSSIBLE

865
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,542
TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US?

866
00:48:47,542 --> 00:48:49,291
IT WAS NOT
IMPOSSIBLE, CAPTAIN.

867
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:50,709
OUR PRESENCE HERE
IS PROOF OF THAT.

868
00:48:51,792 --> 00:48:54,875
YES, AND--AND
CONGRATULATIONS.

869
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:56,667
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG?

870
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:59,083
THE INTERVAL
OF UNCERTAINTY

871
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,333
WAS ACTUALLY FAIRLY
BRIEF, CAPTAIN.

872
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:03,375
IT ONLY SEEMED
LONG TO YOU.

873
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,291
I WAS WAITING
FOR A VICTOR

874
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:06,750
IN THE HAND-TO-HAND
STRUGGLE,

875
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,208
WHICH I ASSUMED
WOULD BE
CAPTAIN GARTH.

876
00:49:09,959 --> 00:49:12,750
BECAUSE OF YOUR
DEPLETED CONDITION.

877
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,875
FAILING A RESOLUTION
TO THE STRUGGLE,

878
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:18,750
I WAS FORCED TO USE
OTHER MEANS

879
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,208
TO MAKE
MY DETERMINATION.

880
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:21,166
I SEE.

881
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:26,083
MR. SPOCK, UM...

882
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,917
LETTING YOURSELF
BE HIT ON THE HEAD--

883
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:30,625
AND I PRESUME YOU
LET YOURSELF BE
HIT ON THE HEAD--

884
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:34,083
IS NOT EXACTLY
A METHOD

885
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:35,500
KING SOLOMON
WOULD HAVE APPROVED.

886
00:49:36,709 --> 00:49:39,125
MR. SCOTT,
READY TO BEAM UP.

887
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:39,542
Scott: AYE, AYE, SIR.
