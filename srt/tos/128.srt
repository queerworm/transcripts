00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,939

WE CAN'T AVOID

HAVE THEM PLOTTED

00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,862
WE'RE GUIDING AROUND

AT THAT TIME, CAPTAIN,

90
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,060

WHAT IS THIS THING,
MR. SPOCK?

102
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,630
IT SEEMS TO BE PULSATING
WITH POWER OF SOME KIND.

103
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,676
ANALYSIS, PLEASE.

104
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,595
UNBELIEVABLE, CAPTAIN.

105
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,597
THAT'S FUNNY.

106
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,266

FOR THIS TO DO
WHAT IT DOES

111
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,568
IS IMPOSSIBLE
BY ANY SCIENCE

112
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,033
IT IS OPERATING
EVEN NOW...

113

PUTTING OUT
WAVES AND WAVES OF

114
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,414

116
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,086

MECHANICS.

121
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,228
THEN WHAT IS IT?

122
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,188
<i>A QUESTION.</i>

123
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,777

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,914
A TIME PORTAL, CAPTAIN--

137
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,791
A GATEWAY TO OTHER TIMES

138
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,209

139
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,711
<i>AS CORRECT AS POSSIBLE</i>

140
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,756
<i>YOUR SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE</i>

143

00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,790
KILLERS!
I WON'T LET YOU GET ME!

147
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,834
I'LL KILL YOU FIRST!

148
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,171
I WON'T LET YOU GET ME!

SPOCK!

151
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,021
IF THAT IS A DOORWAY
BACK THROUGH TIME,

152
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,274
COULD WE
SOMEHOW TAKE BONES

153
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,485
BACK A DAY IN TIME,
THEN...

154
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,028
RELIVE THE ACCIDENT,

155
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,740
THIS TIME BE CERTAIN
THAT THE HYPO ACCIDENT
IS AVOIDED?

156
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,039
LOOK AT THE SPEED
WITH WHICH THE CENTURIES
ARE PASSING, CAPTAIN.

157
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,125
TO STEP THROUGH
ON PRECISELY
THE DAY WE WISH...

158
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,546
GUARDIAN.

159
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,676
CAN YOU CHANGE
THE SPEED AT WHICH
YESTERDAY PASSES?

160
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,305
<i>I WAS MADE TO OFFER</i>
<i>THE PAST IN THIS MANNER.</i>

00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,891
<i>I CANNOT CHANGE.</i>

162
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,192
STRANGELY COMPELLING,
ISN'T IT?

163
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,653
TO STEP THROUGH THERE...

164
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,991
AND LOSE ONESELF
IN ANOTHER WORLD.

165
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,535
I AM A FOOL.

166
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,912
OUR TRICORDER
IS CAPABLE OF RECORDING

167
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,539
EVEN AT THIS SPEED.

168
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,916
I'VE MISSED
TAPING CENTURIES
OF LIVING HISTORY

169
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,709
WHICH NO MAN BEFORE
HAS EVER--

170
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,752
DR. McCOY!

171
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,212
BONES, NO!

172
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,679
WHERE IS HE?

173
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,932
<i>HE HAS PASSED INTO...</i>

174

175
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,564

LOST CONTACT

176

00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,061
SHE'LL BECOME
VERY IMPORTANT,

525
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,438
NATIONALLY FAMOUS.

526
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:20,355
OR, CAPTAIN,

527
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,234
EDITH KEELER
WILL DIE THIS YEAR.

528
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,487
I SAW HER OBITUARY.

529
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,163
SOME SORT OF
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.

530
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,041
YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.

531
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:44,713
THEY BOTH CAN'T BE TRUE.

532
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:48,049
CAPTAIN, EDITH KEELER IS
THE FOCAL POINT IN TIME
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR,

533
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:52,262
THE POINT IN TIME THAT
BOTH WE AND DR. McCOY
HAVE BEEN DRAWN TO.

534
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,515
SHE HAS TWO
POSSIBLE FUTURES THEN,

535
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:59,812
AND, DEPENDING ON WHETHER
SHE LIVES OR DIES,

536
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:04,149
ALL OF HISTORY
WILL BE CHANGED.

537
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,150
AND McCOY...

538
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,444
IS THE RANDOM ELEMENT.

539
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,573
IN HIS CONDITION,
WHAT DOES HE DO?
DOES HE KILL HER?

540
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,533
OR PERHAPS
HE PREVENTS HER
FROM BEING KILLED.

541
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,535
WE DON'T KNOW WHICH.

542
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,457
GET THIS THING FIXED.

543
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:24,294
WE MUST FIND OUT
BEFORE McCOY ARRIVES.

544
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,754
CAPTAIN...

545
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:26,755
SUPPOSE WE DISCOVER

546
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,967
THAT, IN ORDER
TO SET THINGS
STRAIGHT AGAIN,

547
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,344
EDITH KEELER
MUST DIE?

548
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,142
ASSASSINS!

549
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,770
MURDERERS!

550
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,898
MURDERERS!

551
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,650
ASSASSINS!

552
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,946
YOU!

553
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,656
WHAT PLANET IS THIS?

554
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,335
NO!

555
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,670
DON'T RUN!

556
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,463
I WON'T KILL YOU!

557
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,049
IT'S THEY
WHO DO THE KILLING!

558
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,093
DON'T RUN!
I WON'T KILL YOU!

559
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,889
WHY?

560
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:03,769
WHAT IS SO FUNNY
ABOUT MAN REACHING
FOR THE MOON?

561
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,103
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

562
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,688
I JUST KNOW,
THAT'S ALL.

563
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,565
I--I FEEL IT,

564
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,692
AND MORE,
I THINK THAT ONE DAY

565
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,111
THEY'RE GOING TO
TAKE ALL THE MONEY
THAT THEY SPEND NOW

566
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,613
ON WAR AND DEATH--

567
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,156
AND MAKE THEM SPEND IT
ON LIFE.

568
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,158
YES.

569
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,004
YOU SEE THE SAME
THINGS THAT I DO.

570
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,091
WE SPEAK
THE SAME LANGUAGE.

571
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,885
THE VERY SAME.

572
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,304
OHH!

573
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,889
I'M GLAD YOU
GOT AWAY, TOO.

574
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,766
YEAH. I--

575
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,017
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY WANT TO
KILL US?

576
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,394
LOOK, FELLA.
YOU--YOU TAKE A SIP

577
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,688
TOO MUCH OF THAT
OLD WOOD ALKY,

578
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,774
AND ALMOST ANYTHING
SEEMS LIKE IT--

579
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,818
WHERE?

580
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:57,489
WHERE ARE WE?
EARTH?

581
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,659
CONSTELLATIONS
SEEM RIGHT, BUT--

582
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,994
EXPLAIN!

583
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,578
EXPLAIN THIS TRICK.

584
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,288
I--I...

585
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,669
[DOG BARKING]

586
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,506
BIPED...

587
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,758
SMALL...

588
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,681
GOOD CRANIAL
DEVELOPMENT.

589
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,183
NO DOUBT,
CONSIDERABLE
HUMAN ANCESTRY.

590
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,895
IS THAT HOW
YOU'RE ABLE TO
FAKE ALL OF THIS?

591
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:32,732
VERY GOOD.

592
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,401
MODERN MUSEUM
PERFECTION...

593
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,532
RIGHT DOWN
TO THE CEMENT BEAMS.

594
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,703
VERY, VERY GOOD.

595
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,832
OH, I'D GIVE A LOT
TO SEE THE HOSPITAL.

596
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,209
PROBABLY...

597
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,294
NEEDLES AND...

598
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,213
SUTURES.

599
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,383
ALL THE PAIN.

600
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,678
THEY USED TO
HAND-CUT AND SEW PEOPLE

601
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,680
LIKE GARMENTS.

602
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:07,308
NEEDLES AND SUTURES...

603
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,687
ALL THE TERRIBLE PAIN!

604
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,086
HOW LONG BEFORE WE GET
A FULL ANSWER?

605
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,670
I'LL NEED AT LEAST
TWO MORE DAYS

606
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,714
BEFORE I DARE MAKE
ANOTHER ATTEMPT.

607
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,177
McCOY COULD HAVE BEEN
IN THE CITY A WEEK NOW
FOR ALL WE KNOW,

608
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,972
AND WHATEVER HE DOES
THAT AFFECTS HER

609
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:31,017
AND CHANGES HISTORY
COULD HAPPEN TONIGHT,
TOMORROW MORNING.

610
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:34,479
CAPTAIN, OUR LAST
BIT OF INFORMATION

611
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,773
WAS OBTAINED
AT THE EXPENSE
OF 30 HOURS' WORK

612
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:40,652
AND FUSED
AND BURNED CIRCUITS.

613
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:46,491
I MUST KNOW WHETHER SHE
LIVES OR DIES, SPOCK.

614
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,410
I MUST KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

615
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:55,875
Man: EXTREE, EXTREE.
GET YOUR MORNING PAPER!

616
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:59,087
EXTRA! PAPER!
READ ALL ABOUT IT!

617
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,608
OH, MISS...

618
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,402
THAT COFFEE, IT JUST
SMELLS WONDERFUL.

619
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,404
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE!

620
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,365
YOU BETTER SIT DOWN.
COME ON.

621
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,367
I CAN'T. I GOT
TO KEEP MOVING.

622
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,409
I CAN'T LET THEM
FIND ME.

623
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,538
THERE'S A COT
IN THE BACK ROOM.

624
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:36,208
THEY WON'T FIND YOU
THERE. COME ON.

625
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:55,060
THIS IS HOW HISTORY WENT
AFTER McCOY CHANGED IT.

626
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:56,644
HERE...

627
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,647
THE LATE 1930s--
A GROWING PACIFIST MOVEMENT

628
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,192
WHOSE INFLUENCE DELAYED
THE UNITED STATES' ENTRY

629
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,652
INTO THE SECOND WORLD WAR.

630
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,072
WHILE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
DRAGGED ON,

631
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:09,866
GERMANY HAD TIME TO COMPLETE
ITS HEAVY-WATER EXPERIMENTS.

632
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,784
GERMANY--

633
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,204
FASCISM, HITLER.

634
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,330
<i>SIEG...</i>

635
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,706
<i>HEIL!</i>

636
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,833
<i>SIEG HEIL!</i>

637
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,835
WON THE SECOND
WORLD WAR...

638
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,382
BECAUSE ALL THIS
LETS THEM DEVELOP
THE A-BOMB FIRST.

639
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,176
THERE'S NO MISTAKE,
CAPTAIN.

640
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,845
LET ME RUN IT AGAIN.

641
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,937
EDITH KEELER, FOUNDER
OF THE PEACE MOVEMENT.

642
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,564
BUT SHE WAS RIGHT.
PEACE WAS THE WAY.

643
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,359
SHE<i> WAS</i> RIGHT,
BUT AT THE WRONG TIME.

644
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,693
WITH THE A-BOMB,

645
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,238
AND WITH THEIR
V-2 ROCKETS
TO CARRY THEM,

646
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,156
GERMANY CAPTURED
THE WORLD.

647
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,532
NO.

648
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,952
AND ALL THIS
BECAUSE McCOY CAME BACK

649
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:58,373
AND SOMEHOW
KEPT HER FROM DYING
IN A STREET ACCIDENT,

650
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,042
AS SHE WAS MEANT TO.

651
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,169
WE MUST STOP HIM, JIM.

652
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,802
HOW DID SHE DIE?

653
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,720
WHAT DAY?

654
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,058
I CAN ESTIMATE
GENERAL HAPPENINGS
FROM THESE IMAGES,

655
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:20,145
BUT I CAN'T TRACE
DOWN PRECISE ACTIONS

656
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,314
AT EXACT MOMENTS,
CAPTAIN.

657
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,773
I'M SORRY.

658
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,151
SPOCK...

659
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,989
I BELIEVE...

660
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:35,576
I'M IN LOVE
WITH EDITH KEELER.

661
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,373
JIM, EDITH KEELER
MUST DIE.

662
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,975
HEY, NOW. COME ON.

663
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,226
YOU'RE NOT READY
TO TAKE ON

664
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:01,478
ANY TIGERS JUST YET.

665
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,520
LIE DOWN.

666
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:11,154
THE MOST COMMON QUESTION
TO ASK WOULD BE,

667
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,198
WHERE AM I?

668
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:15,825
I DON'T THINK
I'LL ASK IT.

669
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,119
WHY NOT?

670
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,954
THE ONLY POSSIBLE ANSWER

671
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,166
WOULD CONCLUSIVELY
PROVE THAT I'M...

672
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:27,086
EITHER UNCONSCIOUS
OR DEMENTED.

673
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,391
THIS LOOKS
LIKE OLD EARTH
AROUND 1920 OR '25.

674
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:42,101
WOULD YOU CARE
TO TRY FOR '30?

675
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,439
I<i> AM</i> UNCONSCIOUS...

676
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,274
OR DEMENTED.

677
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,402
I HAVE A FRIEND THAT TALKS
ABOUT EARTH

678
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:51,277
THE SAME WAY
THAT YOU DO.

679
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,530
WOULD YOU
LIKE TO MEET HIM?

680
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,989
I'M A SURGEON,

681
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,909
NOT A PSYCHIATRIST.

682
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,874
I AM LEONARD McCOY,

683
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:09,712
SENIOR MEDICAL
OFFICER ABOARD
THE<i> U.S.S. ENTERPRISE.</i>

684
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:17,429
I DON'T MEAN
TO DISBELIEVE YOU,

685
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,473
BUT THAT'S HARDLY
A NAVY UNIFORM.

686
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,349
IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

687
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,268
IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT,
DEAR...

688
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:27,897
BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE
IN YOU, EITHER.

689
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,485
GET SOME REST.

690
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,752
EDITH.

691
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,881
ARE YOU
FOLLOWING ME, SIR?

692
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,841
WITH ULTERIOR
MOTIVES.

693
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:56,968
DOES THAT
PLEASE YOU?

694
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,512
I HOPE
IT MEANS WHAT--OH!

695
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,310
HOW STUPID! I'VE BEEN
UP AND DOWN THOSE STAIRS
A THOUSAND TIMES.

696
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:08,354
I COULD HAVE
BROKEN MY NECK.

697
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,173
CAPTAIN, I DID NOT
PLAN TO EAVESDROP.

698
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:38,009
NO, OF COURSE
YOU DIDN'T.

699
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:42,221
I MUST POINT OUT THAT
WHEN SHE STUMBLED...

700
