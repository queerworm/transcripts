1
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,604
START YOUR READINGS.

2
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,337
WELL...

3
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,255
I JUST MIGHT
STAKE OUT A CLAIM

4
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,298
AND SETTLE DOWN
HERE, JIM.

5
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,342
IT IS SPECTACULAR,
ISN'T IT?

6
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,678
IT'S A SHAME
TO INTRUDE.

7
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:56,765
WELL, THE LAST SCOUT SHIP
REPORTED SOME PRETTY
STRANGE SENSOR READINGS.

8
00:00:58,684 --> 00:00:59,810
STARFLEET WANTS
IT INVESTIGATED

9
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,102
AND THE INHABITANTS
CONTACTED.

10
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,938
WE DO WHAT WE'RE TOLD.

11
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,274
THE SOIL HERE IS
REMARKABLY RICH AND
FERTILE, CAPTAIN.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,485
HUSBANDRY WOULD BE
QUITE EFFICACIOUS.

13
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,612
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

14
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,280
OH, QUITE SURE.

15
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,241
READINGS INDICATE
THE ENTIRE PLANET

16
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,243
IS COVERED WITH
GROWTH LIKE THIS.

17
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,745
CURIOUS--
EVEN AT THE POLES

18
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,830
THERE'S VERY
LITTLE VARIATION
IN TEMPERATURE

19
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,332
WHICH MAINTAINS
A PLANETWIDE AVERAGE
OF 76 DEGREES.

20
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,002
I KNOW.
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.

21
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,962
IT MAKES ME HOMESICK.

22
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,923
JUST LIKE RUSSIA.

23
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:32,551
MORE LIKE THE GARDEN
OF EDEN, ENSIGN.

24
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,677
OF COURSE, DOCTOR.

25
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,263
THE GARDEN
OF EDEN WAS JUST
OUTSIDE MOSCOW.

26
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,473
A VERY NICE PLACE.

27
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,226
IT MUST'VE MADE
ADAM AND EVE
VERY SAD TO LEAVE.

28
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,395
"JUST OUTSIDE MOSCOW."
ALL RIGHT.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,147
THERE'S A VILLAGE ABOUT
17 KILOMETERS AWAY
ON BEARING 2-3-2.

30
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,566
WE'LL HEAD THAT WAY.

31
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,076
CAPTAIN.

32
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,582
Captain.

33
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,298
DEAD.

34
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,513
WHAT DID SOMEBODY SAY?

35
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,977
THAT PARADISE MUST'VE
LOOKED LIKE THIS?

36
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:36,073
SPACE--THE FINAL FRONTIER.

37
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:46,291
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES OF
THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

38
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,501
ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--

39
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,211
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

40
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,257
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

41
00:02:54,382 --> 00:03:35,590
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

42
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,929
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 3715.3.

43
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,597
WHILE MAKING
A ROUTINE EXPLORATION

44
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,766
OF THE UNEXPLORED
GAMMA TRIANGULI 6,

45
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,853
ONE OF MY MEN HAS BEEN KILLED
BY A POISONOUS PLANT.

46
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,148
AS SOON AS WE GET
OUT OF THE WAY,
BEAM THE BODY UP.

47
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,357
AYE, CAPTAIN.

48
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,359
THAT'S A SHAME
ABOUT HENDORFF.

49
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,028
WE SEEM TO HAVE
A PROBLEM HERE, TOO.

50
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,320
WHAT IS IT?

51
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,907
WE'RE LOSING POTENCY
IN OUR ANTIMATTER PODS.

52
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,658
I DON'T THINK
IT'S SERIOUS,
BUT WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT.

53
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,243
WHAT'S CAUSING IT?

54
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,079
I'M NOT SURE, SIR.

55
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,455
BUT WE'VE RUN MEASUREMENTS
ON THE ELECTROMAGNETIC
FIELD OF THE PLANET,

56
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,666
AND THEY ARE
A WEE BIT ABNORMAL.

57
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,585
THAT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT.

58
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,171
BUT YOU SAY
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT?

59
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,799
WELL, SIR, I DIDN'T
EXACTLY SAY THAT.

60
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,884
WELL, STAY
ON TOP OF IT.

61
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,260
WE'VE GOT A JOB
TO DO HERE. WE MIGHT
AS WELL FINISH IT.

62
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,763
I HEAR
IT'S NICE DOWN THERE.

63
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,931
YEAH.

64
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,640
IT'S NICE.

65
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,517
IF WE'RE A LITTLE
MORE CAREFUL,

66
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,104
WE SHOULDN'T RUN
INTO ANY MORE TROUBLE.

67
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,023
I COULD DO WITH A NICE
WALK IN A GARDEN

68
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,234
WITH GREEN LEAVES
AND GRASS.

69
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,485
WE'LL DO
THE WALKING, SCOTTY.

70
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,613
YOU GET ON
THE ANTIMATTER POD.

71
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,823
IF IT GETS ANY WORSE,
LET ME KNOW, WE'LL BEAM UP.

72
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,617
KIRK OUT.

73
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,326
I FIND THAT MOST
UNUSUAL, CAPTAIN.

74
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,121
WELL, SCOTTY
WILL HANDLE IT.

75
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,997
WE GOT A JOB TO DO.

76
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,208
TURN UP ANYTHING
ON YOUR TRICORDER?

77
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,961
INDEED. SUBSURFACE
VIBRATIONS FOR MILES
IN ALL DIRECTIONS.

78
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,503
THAT'S STRANGE.

79
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,758
QUITE STRONG,
FAIRLY REGULAR,
ARTIFICIALLY PRODUCED.

80
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,010
MALLORY.

81
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,304
YES, CAPTAIN?

82
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,431
WE'RE HEADING
FOR THE VILLAGE.

83
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,018
AVOID CONTACT
WITH THE HUMANOIDS.

84
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,104
AND I WANT YOU
AND MARPLE TO MAKE
A FULL RECONNAISSANCE.

85
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,107
SO BE CAREFUL. THERE
MAY BE OTHER DANGERS
BESIDES POISONOUS PLANTS.

86
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,524
KEEP IN CONSTANT
COMMUNICATION.

87
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,152
AYE-AYE, SIR.

88
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,611
CAPTAIN.

89
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,283
WHAT IS IT?

90
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:28,369
THERE'S A HUMANOID HIDING
DIRECTLY BEHIND US

91
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,914
MOVING WITH
REMARKABLE AGILITY,

92
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,625
BEARING 1-8.

93
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,096
WHAT IS IT,
MR. SPOCK?

94
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,597
A VISITOR.

95
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:56,606
ONE WANTING TO RETAIN HIS
ANONYMITY, I SHOULD SAY.

96
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,195
ALL THIS BEAUTY,

97
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,446
AND NOW MR. HENDORFF DEAD,

98
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,073
SOMEBODY WATCHING US.

99
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,201
IT'S FRIGHTENING.

100
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,494
IF YOU INSIST
ON WORRYING,

101
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,579
WORRY ABOUT ME.

102
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,125
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO GET YOU IN
A PLACE LIKE THIS

103
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,375
FOR A LONG TIME.

104
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,712
MR. CHEKOV,
LIEUTENANT LANDON.

105
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,005
I KNOW YOU FIND EACH
OTHER FASCINATING,

106
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,673
BUT WE'RE NOT HERE

107
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,091
TO CONDUCT
A FIELD EXPERIMENT
IN HUMAN BIOLOGY.

108
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,135
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO TAKE SOME READINGS.

109
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,094
ANYTHING?

110
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,056
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT MOVES LIKE A CAT.

111
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,182
JIM, I DON'T LIKE THIS.

112
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,433
NEITHER DO I.
ALL HANDS!

113
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,103
WE'VE BEEN WATCHED,
WE'LL PROBABLY
BE WATCHED.

114
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,105
WE'RE MOVING OUT.

115
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,523
FORMATION "L."

116
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,092
INTERESTING.

117
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,052
EXTREMELY LOW
SPECIFIC GRAVITY,

118
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,972
SOME URANINITE,
HORNLBLENDE,
QUARTZ.

119
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,102
FRAGILE,
GOOD CLEAVAGE.

120
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,437
AN ANALYSIS SHOULD
PROVE INTERESTING.

121
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,652
WOULD YOU MIND
BEING CAREFUL WHERE YOU
THROW YOUR ROCKS, MR. SPOCK?

122
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,653
OBVIOUSLY HIGHLY
UNSTABLE, CAPTAIN.

123
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,031
THIS COULD BE A FIND
OF SOME IMPORTANCE.

124
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,866
IN LARGE QUANTITIES,

125
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,077
IT COULD BE
A CONSIDERABLE
SOURCE OF POWER.

126
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,037
GARDEN OF EDEN...

127
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,123
WITH LAND MINES.

128
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,855
"ENTERPRISE"
TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

129
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:01,940
KIRK HERE.

130
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,691
SCOTT, SIR.

131
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,610
OUR ANTIMATTER PODS
ARE COMPLETELY INERT.

132
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,821
I COULDN'T STOP IT,
BUT I KNOW WHY.

133
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,281
WHY?

134
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,991
SOMETHING FROM THE SURFACE.

135
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,285
IT'S LIKE A PAIL
OF WATER ON A FIRE.

136
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,578
A BEAM, MAYBE,
OR A TRANSMISSION.

137
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,247
AND IT'S STILL ON.

138
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,748
I'M HAVING IT ANALYZED,

139
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,626
BUT IT'S LIKE NOTHING
I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE.

140
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,796
AND IT'S PINPOINTED
IN THE AREA OF THAT VILLAGE
WE LOCATED DOWN THERE.

141
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,756
WE'RE HEADING
THERE NOW, SCOTTY.
NEED ANY HELP?

142
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,675
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING YOU
CAN DO ABOUT IT, SIR.

143
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,261
AND THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
ANY IMMEDIATE DANGER.

144
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,347
ALL RIGHT, SCOTTY.
WE'LL TRY AND FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN HERE.

145
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,015
KIRK OUT.

146
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,891
IF SCOTT IS CORRECT
ABOUT THE FORCE
FROM THE SURFACE,

147
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,686
IT MAY HAVE TO DO
WITH THE VIBRATIONS
I READ EARLIER.

148
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,104
SOME KIND OF GENERATOR?

149
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,148
IF SO,
AN IMMENSE ONE,

150
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,317
PROBABLY
SUBTERRANEAN.

151
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,071
WHAT'S THAT?

152
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,282
SOME OF THE THORNS LIKE
THOSE THAT KILLED HENDORFF.

153
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,741
SEE THE STUFF
ON THE END?

154
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,328
IT'S LIKE SAPLIN, ONLY
IT'S 1,000 TIMES STRONGER

155
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,746
PECULIAR STUFF
TO FIND IN PARADISE.

156
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,999
JIM!

157
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,338
SPOCK!

158
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,552
SPOCK!

159
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,140
SECURITY ALERT.

160
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,522
IS HE ALIVE?

161
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,607
[HYPOSPRAY HISSES]

162
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,864
I FILLED HIM WITH
ENOUGH MASSOFORM "D"

163
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,366
TO MAKE
THE WHOLE CREW
TURN HANDSPRINGS

164
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,576
AND HE'S NOT
RESPONDING.

165
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,537
WE'VE GOT
TO GET HIM BACK
TO THE SHIP, JIM.

166
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,331
KIRK TO "ENTERPRISE."

167
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,832
SCOTT HERE, SIR.

168
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,918
WE'RE BEAMING UP.
NOTIFY TRANSPORTER ROOM.

169
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,253
AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO
PICK UP MALLORY AND MARPLE.

170
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,796
THEY'RE SCOUTING
AHEAD OF US.

171
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,382
AYE-AYE, SIR.

172
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,176
TRANSPORTER ROOM, STAND BY
TO BEAM UP LANDING PARTY.

173
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,178

00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,187
STATUS--ARE YOU
STILL HOLDING?

351
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,063
KYLE.

352
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,230
NO, SIR.
WE'RE SLIPPING.

353
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,191
COMPUTER BANKS,
KYLE.

354
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,360
FEED IN OUR RATE.
GET ME A FIGURE.

355
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,404
WE MIGHT BE
ABLE TO PULL OUT
WITH WARP DRIVE.

356
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,615
BUT WITHOUT IT,
WE'RE LIKE A FLY
ON FLYPAPER.

357
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,617
EVEN WORSE,
WE'RE STARTING
TO LOSE GROUND.

358
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,743
HURRY UP WITH
THAT FIGURE, KYLE.

359
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,329
MAINTAIN FULL REVERSE THRUST
AGAINST THE PULL.

360
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,289
PUT A TEAM ON
THAT WARP DRIVE.
GET IT WORKING.

361
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,916
I'VE DONE THAT,
CAPTAIN.

362
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,627
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO DO A THING.

363
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,463
IT'S NO GOOD, CAPTAIN.

364
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,675
WITH MAXIMUM THRUST
AGAINST THE PULL,

365
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,428
WE'LL ONLY BE ABLE
TO MAINTAIN FULL POWER
FOR 16 HOURS,

366
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,806
THEN WE BURN UP FOR SURE.

367
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,349
SCOTTY...

368
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,852
YOU'RE MY CHIEF ENGINEER.

369
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,647
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT THAT SHIP THAT
THERE IS TO KNOW,

370
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,273
MORE THAN THE MEN
WHO DESIGNED IT.

371
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,028
IF YOU CAN'T GET THOSE
WARP ENGINES WORKING...

372
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,487
YOU'RE FIRED.

373
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,657
I'LL DO EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO DO, SIR.
SCOTT OUT.

374
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,373
TELL ME ABOUT VAAL.

375
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,959
ALL THE WORLD
KNOWS ABOUT VAAL.

376
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,379
HE CAUSES THE RAINS
TO FALL AND THE SUN
TO SHINE.

377
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,381
ALL GOOD
COMES FROM VAAL.

378
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,799
TAKE ME TO HIM.

379
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,760
I WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM.

380
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,970
I SHALL
TAKE YOU TO HIM,

381
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,724
BUT HE WILL
NOT SPEAK TO YOU. HE
SPEAKS ONLY TO ME.

382
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,642
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

383
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,156
VAAL.

384
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:41,675
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 3715.6.

385
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,512
WE HAVE BEEN
INTRODUCED TO VAAL.

386
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,641
EVIDENTLY THE SOURCE
OF THE PLANET'S
POWER EMANATIONS

387
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,226
AND POSSIBLY THE FORCE

388
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,896
THAT THREATENS BOTH US
AND OUR SHIP.

389
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,023
FASCINATING.

390
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,568
VERY HIGH
ORDER OF WORKMANSHIP.

391
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,487
VERY ANCIENT.

392
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,447
GENERATING GREAT POWER.

393
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,075
BUT THIS IS NOT THE
CENTER, MR. SPOCK?

394
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,494
NO, CAPTAIN. THE CENTER IS
DEEP IN THE EARTH BENEATH US.

395
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,454
THIS IS AN ACCESS POINT.

396
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,124
IT WOULD
ALSO SEEM TO BE--

397
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,878
A FORCE FIELD?

398
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,130
OBVIOUSLY.

399
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:19,964
YOU ALL RIGHT?

400
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,590
YES, QUITE.

401
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:28,472
IT EXTENDS SOME
30 FEET BEYOND THE FIGURE
IN ALL DIRECTIONS.

402
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,891
CONVENTIONAL
IN COMPOSITION...

403
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,351
AND QUITE FORMIDABLE.

404
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:37,857
AKUTA, HOW DO YOU
TALK TO VAAL?

405
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,275
VAAL CALLS ME.

406
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,400
ONLY THEN.

407
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,944
WELL, WE CAN'T GET TO IT.

408
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,865
WE CAN'T TALK TO IT
UNLESS IT WANTS
TO TALK TO US.

409
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,991
VAAL SLEEPS NOW.

410
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,035
WHEN HE IS HUNGRY,

411
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,871
YOU MAY BE ABLE
TO SPEAK WITH HIM
IF HE DESIRES IT.

412
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,873
WHEN DOES HE GET HUNGRY?

413
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,082
SOON.

414
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,834
COME. WE WILL GIVE YOU
FOOD AND DRINK.

415
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,628
IF YOU ARE TIRED,
YOU MAY REST.

416
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,692
THESE ARE
PEOPLE OF VAAL.

417
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,696
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

418
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,868
THERE ARE NO OTHERS.

419
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,704
THE, UH, CHILDREN.

420
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,456
CHILDREN?

421
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,459
HA HA. YOU USE
UNKNOWN WORDS TO ME.

422
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,878
LITTLE ONES
LIKE YOURSELVES.

423
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,880
THEY GROW.

424
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,882
AHH! REPLACEMENTS.

425
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,466
NONE ARE NECESSARY.

426
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,593
THEY ARE FORBIDDEN
BY VAAL.

427
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:51,722
BUT WHEN A MAN
AND WOMAN FALL IN LOVE...

428
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,473
"LOVE."
HA HA HA HA.

429
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,892
STRANGE WORDS--
CHILDREN, LOVE.

430
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,186
WHAT IS LOVE?

431
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,814
LOVE IS...

432
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,983
WHEN TWO PEOPLE ARE...

433
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,442
AHH...

434
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,862
YES. THE HOLDING.
THE TOUCHING.

435
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,281
VAAL HAS FORBIDDEN THIS.

436
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:11,325
WELL, THERE GOES
PARADISE.

437
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,494
THESE PEOPLE...

438
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,871
ARE FROM ANOTHER PLACE.

439
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,997
THEY HAVE COME AMONG US.

440
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,665
WELCOME THEM!

441
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,711
WELCOME TO VAAL.
WELCOME TO VAAL.

442
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,507
OUR HOMES
ARE OPEN TO YOU.

443
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,843
WELL, THANK YOU.

444
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,846
IT, UH,
DOES SOMETHING FOR YOU.

445
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,848
YES, INDEED
IT DOES, CAPTAIN.

446
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,892
IT MAKES ME
UNCOMFORTABLE.

447
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:37,977
I AM SAYANA.

448
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,895
YOU HAVE A NAME?

449
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,938
YES. SPOCK.

450
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,856
I AM SPOCK.

451
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:43,899
HA HA HA.
SPOCK?

452
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,567
HA HA HA.

453
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,654
I FAIL TO SEE
WHAT THEY FIND
SO AMUSING.

454
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,239
HA HA HA HA!
HA HA...

455
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,573
COME!

456
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,506
THIS HOUSE IS YOUR HOUSE.

457
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:12,470
I WILL SEND YOU
MORE FOOD AND DRINK.

458
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:16,098
YOU ARE WELCOME
IN THE PLACE OF VAAL.

459
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,853
NOW WE'RE WELCOME.

460
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:24,106
A WHILE AGO,
THIS WHOLE PLANET
WAS TRYING TO KILL US.

461
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,816
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

462
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,027
NOTHING MAKES
SENSE DOWN HERE. KIRK
TO "ENTERPRISE." COME IN.

463
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,236
SCOTT HERE.

464
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,612
STATUS REPORT, SCOTTY.

465
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,198
NO CHANGE, CAPTAIN.

466
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,407
THE ORBIT IS DECAYING
ALONG COMPUTED LINES.

467
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,326
NO SUCCESS WITH
THE WARP DRIVE.

468
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,161
WE'RE GOING DOWN,
AND WE CAN'T STOP IT.

469
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,997
I'M SICK OF HEARING
THAT WORD "CAN'T." GET
THAT SHIP OUT OF THERE!

470
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:43,209
SIR, WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WITHIN
ENGINEERING REASON.

471
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,294
THEN USE
YOUR IMAGINATION.

472
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,671
TIE EVERY OUNCE OF
POWER THE SHIP HAS
INTO THE IMPULSE ENGINES.

473
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,507
DISCARD THE WARP DRIVE
AND NACELLES
IF YOU HAVE TO

474
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,091
AND CRACK OUT OF THERE
WITH THE MAIN SECTION,

475
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,052
BUT GET THAT SHIP
OUT OF THERE!

476
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,095
SIR, I'M GOING TO
SWITCH OVER EVERYTHING

477
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,432
BUT THE LIFE SUPPORT
SYSTEMS AND BOOST
THE IMPULSE POWER,

478
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,059
BUT THAT'S JUST
ABOUT AS DANGEROUS.

479
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,061
DO IT. KIRK OUT.

480
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,063
INCREDIBLE.

481
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,481
REPORT.

482
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,233
I JUST RAN A THOROUGH
CHECK ON THE NATIVES,

483
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,026
AND THERE'S
A COMPLETE LACK

484
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,610
OF HARMFUL BACTERIA
IN THEIR SYSTEMS,

485
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,113
NO DECALCIFICATION,
NO DEGENERATION
OF TISSUE,

486
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,115
NO ARTERIOSCLEROSIS.

487
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,410
IN SIMPLE TERMS, JIM...

488
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:18,702
THEY'RE NOT GROWING OLD,

489
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,705
AND I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL
YOU HOW OLD THEY ARE--

490
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,999
20 YEARS OR 20,000 YEARS.

491
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,377
I SEE.

492
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:28,879
OPINION.

493
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,381
QUITE POSSIBLE.

494
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,466
IT CHECKS WITH
MY ATMOSPHERIC ANALYSIS.

495
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,510
THEIR ATMOSPHERE
COMPLETELY NEGATES

496
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,762
ANY HARMFUL EFFECTS
FROM THEIR SUN.

497
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:41,434
ADD TO THAT
A SIMPLE DIET...

498
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,144
PERFECTLY CONTROLLED
TEMPERATURE...

499
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,604
NO NATURAL ENEMIES...

500
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,567
APPARENTLY NO VICES,
NO REPLACEMENTS NEEDED.

501
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,152
MAYBE IT IS PARADISE
AFTER ALL.

502
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,364
[GONG SOUNDS]

503
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,587
MR. SPOCK.

504
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,067
APPARENTLY,
OUR HYPOTHESIS
IS CORRECT.

505
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,528
THERE IS
NO LIVING BEING THERE.

506
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,823
IT IS A MACHINE,
NOTHING MORE.

507
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,454
WELL, THE FIELD'S DOWN,
PEOPLE ARE GOING IN.

508
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,415
LET'S SEE WHAT KIND
OF LUCK WE HAVE.

509
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,543
[THUNDER]

510
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,506
THAT'S NOT THE WAY.

511
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,090
EVIDENTLY NOT.

512
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,758
THIS IS NO ORDINARY
MACHINE, CAPTAIN.

513
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,929
IT MAY WELL POSSESS
A RUDIMENTARY INTELLIGENCE.

514
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,182
BUT IT NEEDS
TO EAT FREQUENTLY,

515
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,309
SO IT CAN'T HAVE ANY
GREAT POWER RESERVES.

516
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,228
THAT MAY NOT BE
OF ANY HELP.

517
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,147
THE "ENTERPRISE" HAS
ONLY 10 HOURS LEFT

518
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,650
IN WHICH TO BREAK FREE.

519
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,276
YEAH.

520
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,320
WHAT HAPPENS...

521
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:19,948
IF VAAL WEAKENS
AROUND FEEDING TIME?

522
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:25,245
SPOCK, CHECK THE
ELECTROMAGNETIC SECTION
OF THE ASTROPHYSICS LAB.

523
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,330
GET AN ESTIMATE
OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT
OF ENERGY

524
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,290
BEING EXPENDED
AGAINST THE SHIP.

525
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,626
HAVE THEM MEASURE IT
HOUR BY HOUR.

526
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,836
ACKNOWLEDGED.

527
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,893
WHAT'S GOING ON, JIM?

528
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,853
MESS CALL.

529
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,190
IN MY VIEW,
A SPLENDID EXAMPLE
OF RECIPROCITY.

530
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,942
IT WOULD TAKE
A COMPUTERIZED VULCAN
MIND, SUCH AS YOURS,

531
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,153
TO MAKE THAT KIND
OF A STATEMENT.

532
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,490
DOCTOR, YOU INSIST ON
APPLYING HUMAN STANDARDS
TO NONHUMAN CULTURES.

533
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,660
I REMIND YOU THAT HUMANS
ARE ONLY A TINY MINORITY
IN THIS GALAXY.

534
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,872
THERE ARE
CERTAIN ABSOLUTES,
MR. SPOCK.

535
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,875
AND ONE OF THEM IS
THE RIGHT OF HUMANOIDS

536
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,835
TO A FREE AND
UNCHAINED ENVIRONMENT,

537
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,255
THE RIGHT
TO HAVE CONDITIONS
WHICH PERMIT GROWTH.

538
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,340
ANOTHER IS THEIR RIGHT
TO CHOOSE A SYSTEM

539
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,842
WHICH SEEMS
TO WORK FOR THEM.

540
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,262
JIM, YOU'RE NOT JUST
GOING TO STAND BY

541
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,348
AND BE BLINDED
TO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

542
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,350
THESE ARE HUMANOIDS,
INTELLIGENT.

543
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,810
THEY NEED
TO ADVANCE AND GROW.

544
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,021
DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT
MY READINGS INDICATE?

545
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,316
THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE
OR PROGRESS HERE IN
AT LEAST 10,000 YEARS.

546
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,860
THIS ISN'T LIFE.
IT'S STAGNATION.

547
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,572
DOCTOR, THESE PEOPLE
ARE HEALTHY
AND THEY ARE HAPPY.

548
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,449
WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE
TO CALL IT,

549
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:46,577
THIS SYSTEM WORKS,
DESPITE YOUR EMOTIONAL
REACTION TO IT.

550
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,454
IT MIGHT WORK FOR
YOU, MR. SPOCK,

551
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,623
BUT IT DOESN'T
WORK FOR ME.

552
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:54,000
HUMANOIDS...LIVING
SO THEY CAN SERVICE

553
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,128
A HUNK OF TIN.

554
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,547
GENTLEMEN, I THINK
THIS PHILOSOPHICAL
ARGUMENT CAN WAIT

555
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,048
UNTIL OUR SHIP
IS OUT OF DANGER.

556
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,967
[COMMUNICATOR BEEPS]

557
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,719
KIRK HERE.

558
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,095
SCOTTY, SIR.

559
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,139
WE HAVE A READING
ON THE POWER SOURCE

560
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,724
MR. SPOCK REQUESTED.

561
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,309
WHEN WE FIRST MONITORED,

562
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,269
IT WAS GENERATING
ALTERNATING CYCLES

563
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,229
TOTALLING 100
TO THE 20th POWER
WALTHAM UNITS.

564
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,564
DID IT MAINTAIN, SCOTTY?

565
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,651
NO, SIR.
POWER'S DROPPING
BIT BY BIT,

566
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,152
NOMINAL
BUT A DEFINITE DRAIN.

567
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,862
GOOD. KEEP MONITORING.

568
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,116
HOW ARE YOU
COMING ALONG WITH
THE CIRCUIT SWITCHOVER?

569
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,118
WE'RE PUTTING EVERYTHING
BUT THE KITCHEN SINK

570
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,662
INTO THE IMPULSE POWER, SIR.

571
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,623
IT WILL TAKE US
ANOTHER EIGHT HOURS
TO COMPLETE THE WORK.

572
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,040
THAT'S CUTTING IT
A BIT FINE, SCOTTY.

573
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,462
AYE, BUT IF WE
DON'T BREAK OUT...

574
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:42,090
I'D RATHER WE DIDN'T
HAVE TO WAIT TOO LONG

575
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,925
FOR THE END OF IT.

576
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,512
KIRK OUT.

577
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,813
EVERY TIME I THINK
OF THE "ENTERPRISE,"
BURNING UP AND US--

578
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,230
YEOMAN, YOU'RE
WASTING ENERGY.

579
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,649
CAPTAIN,
WE ARE TRAPPED ON THIS--

580
00:30:58,774 --> 00:30:59,775
SIT DOWN...

581
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,318
AND HAVE
SOMETHING TO EAT.

582
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,236
THE "ENTERPRISE"
IS UP THERE--

583
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,489
THAT HASN'T
HAPPENED YET.

584
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,870
I WONDER WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN...

585
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,872
YEOMAN, SPECULATE.

586
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,584
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF SOMEONE
ON THIS PLANET DIED?

587
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,795
BUT THEY CAN'T.

588
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,548
YOU SAID THAT VAAL
TAKES CARE OF THEM.

589
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,633
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.

590
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:28,679
YES...I SUPPOSE
IF SOMEONE

591
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,556
WERE TO FALL OFF
A CLIFF OR SOMETHING,

592
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,599
THAT MIGHT
UPSET THE BALANCE
OF THE POPULATION.

593
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:35,519
THEN THEY WOULD
NEED A REPLACEMENT.

594
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,937
THEY'D NEED
A REPLACEMENT.

595
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,147
OPINION, MR. SPOCK?

596
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,982
I SEE
NO ALTERNATIVE.

597
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,860
BUT THESE PEOPLE...

598
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:47,197
I MEAN, IF THEY DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT...

599
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,540
WHAT I MEAN IS...

600
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,793
THEY DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE ANY NATURAL...

601
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,087
UM...

602
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,424
I MEAN...
HOW IS IT...DONE?

603
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:15,308
MR. SPOCK?

604
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,477
YOU'RE
THE SCIENCE OFFICER.

605
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,187
WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN IT
TO THE YOUNG LADY?

606
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:30,908
WELL,
I...CAN BELIEVE
IT'S SAFE--AHEM--

607
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,369
SAFE TO ASSUME
THAT THEY WOULD...

608
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,956
RECEIVE
THE NECESSARY...
INSTRUCTIONS.

609
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,751
FROM A MACHINE?

610
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,838
THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE.

611
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,102
I UNDERSTAND, VAAL.

612
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,354
IT SHALL BE DONE.

613
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,536
YOU KNOW, IF IT
WEREN'T FOR...VAAL,

614
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,247
THIS PLACE WOULD BE
A PARADISE.

615
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:30,008
ANY PLACE
WE CAN BE TOGETHER
IS PARADISE.

616
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,768
PAV...

617
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,771
CAN THE SHIP
REALLY BREAK AWAY?

618
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,898
I DON'T KNOW.

619
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,068
WILL WE BE ABLE
TO GET BACK ABOARD?

620
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,947
MARTHA, I DON'T KNOW.

621
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,619
BUT IF WE DO
HAVE TO STAY HERE,

622
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,039
WOULD IT BE SO...
VERY BAD?

623
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,252
NO...

624
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,588
NOT IF YOU'RE WITH ME.

625
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,734
WHY DO YOU
LOOK LIKE THAT?

626
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,653
THE WAY THEY TOUCHED...

627
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,697
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

628
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,490
THEY WERE NOT ANGRY.

629
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,993
I THINK IT WAS
PLEASANT FOR THEM.

630
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,412
BUT WHAT IS
TO BE GAINED?

631
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,706
IT IS NOT A DANCE.

632
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,251
IT GATHERS NO FOOD.

633
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:49,004
IT DOES NOT SERVE VAAL.

634
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,342
BUT...

635
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,637
IT DID SEEM
AS THOUGH IT WAS...

636
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,472
PLEASANT TO THEM.

637
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,926
IT IS PLEASANT, MAKORA.

638
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,554
YES.

639
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,936
THEY TOUCHED...

640
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,771
IN THIS WAY.

641
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,340
[THUNDER]

642
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,759
VAAL! HE IS ANGRY.

643
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,803
THE LAW IS PLAIN.

644
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,806
I HAVE GIVEN YOU
THE WORDS OF VAAL.

645
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,808
DO YOU BEG
THE LIGHTNING TO STRIKE?

646
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:28,186
WE SAW THE STRANGERS,
THE TWO OF THEM,
DO THIS THING.

647
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,521
YOU COPIED THEM?

648
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,023
WE MEANT NO HARM.

649
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,232
[ALARM SOUNDS]

650
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,866
VAAL SPEAKS TRULY TO ME.

651
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,535
THE NEWCOMERS ARE A DANGER.

652
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,331
TELL THE MEN OF VAAL TO
MEET ME IN THE CLEAR PLACE

653
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,458
WHEN THE STRANGERS
ARE ASLEEP.

654
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,294
IT IS VAAL'S OWN WORDS.

655
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,268
VAAL HAS SPOKEN TO ME.

656
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,312
HIS WORDS ARE TRUE.
HEAR THEM.

657
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,858
WE ARE TO KILL
THE STRANGERS.

658
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:15,859
KILL?

659
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,903
AKUTA...

660
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,738
WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

661
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:26,452
IT IS A...THING TO DO,
LIKE...LIKE FEEDING VAAL.

662
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:30,082
VAAL EXPLAINED IT TO ME.
I WILL SHOW YOU.

663
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:34,669
THIS...IS THE HEAD
OF ONE OF THE STRANGERS.

664
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,714
FIND--A HEAVY STICK.

665
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,008
COME UP FROM BEHIND
THE STRANGER

666
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,843
AND DO THIS.

667
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,685
IT IS A SIMPLE THING.

668
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,312
IT IS THE WORD OF VAAL.

669
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,398
IT WILL BE DONE...

670
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,483
TO ALL OF THEM...

671
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:01,071
WHEN THE SUN RETURNS
IN THE MORNING.

672
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,962
I AM CONCERNED, CAPTAIN.

673
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,047
THIS MAY NOT BE
AN IDEAL SOCIETY,

674
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,715
BUT IT IS A VIABLE ONE.

675
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,716
BONES WAS RIGHT.

676
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,219
THESE PEOPLE
AREN'T LIVING.
THEY'RE EXISTING.

677
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,554
THEY DON'T CREATE,
THEY DON'T PRODUCE,
THEY DON'T EVEN THINK.

678
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,932
THEY EXIST
TO SERVICE A MACHINE.

679
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,935
IF WE DO WHAT
IT SEEMS WE MUST,

680
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,519
IN MY OPINION,

681
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,480
IT WOULD BE
IN DIRECT VIOLATION

682
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,898
OF THE NONINTERFERENCE
DIRECTIVE.

683
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,524
THESE ARE PEOPLE...

684
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,735
NOT ROBOTS.

685
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,116
THEY SHOULD HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY
OF CHOICE.

686
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,119
WE OWE IT TO THEM
TO INTERFERE.

687
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,412
STARFLEET COMMAND
MAY THINK OTHERWISE.

688
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,415
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

689
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,417
WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A LOOK AROUND?

690

691
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,421
HERE, SIR.

692
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,631
HOW IS IT GOING,
SCOTTY?

693
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,342
ALMOST READY, SIR. WE NEED
A HALF AN HOUR YET.

694
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,969
YOU REALIZE THAT
WITHIN 45 MINUTES,

695
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,930
THE SHIP WILL
BE PULLED DOWN INTO
THE ATMOSPHERE?

696
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,058
I KNOW THAT.
AS YOU SAID, THAT'S
CUTTING THINGS FINE.

697
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,059
YES, I--

698
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:14,060
CAPTAIN!

699
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:15,645
KIRK OUT.

700
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,773
WHAT IS IT?

701
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,233
DISTURBING.

702
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,443
THE PEOPLE OF VAAL SEEM
TO HAVE DISAPPEARED.

703
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,825
FORCE FIELD, CAPTAIN.

704
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,457
VAAL...

705
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,880
WE ARE ON
A PEACEFUL MISSION.

706
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,799
WE MEAN NO HARM TO YOU
OR YOUR PEOPLE.

707
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,634
[THUNDER]

708
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,224
VARIATION IN IMPULSES,
CAPTAIN.

709
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,809
I BELIEVE IT IS
READING US.

710
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,602
STRONG JUMP
ON ALL WAVELENGTHS.

711
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,570
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

712
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,588
BONES!

713
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,851
SECOND-DEGREE BURNS.

714
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,938
NOT SERIOUS,
BUT I'LL BET THEY SMART.

715
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:43,275
DOCTOR, YOU HAVE
AN UNSURPASSED TALENT

716
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,526
FOR UNDERSTATEMENT.

717
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,697
MARPLE!

718
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,352
PUT THEM IN THE HUT.

719
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,729
FIND OUT
WHERE THE WOMEN ARE.

720
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,606
PUT THEM IN THERE, TOO.

721
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,031
THE GOOD DOCTOR
WAS CONCERNED

722
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,451
THAT THE VAALIANS
ACHIEVE TRUE HUMAN
STATURE.

723
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,411
I SUBMIT THERE IS
NO CAUSE FOR WORRY.

724
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,205
THEY'VE TAKEN
THE FIRST STEP.

725
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:41,666
THEY'VE LEARNED TO KILL.

726
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,723
WE'RE READY HERE, SIR.

727
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,142
ALL AVAILABLE POWER
HAS BEEN CHANNELED

728
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,643
INTO THE IMPULSE ENGINES.

729
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,729
WE HAVE 12 MINUTES
BEFORE ENTERING
ATMOSPHERE.

730
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,107
ALL RIGHT, SCOTTY,
PUT HER IN FULL REVERSE.

731
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,360
GET HER OUT OF THERE.

732
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,531
FULL REVERSE,
MR. KYLE, ALL ENGINES.

733
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,037
SIR!

734
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,123
CAPTAIN, WE'RE DOING IT.
WE'RE PULLING AWAY!

735
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,465
SCOTTY,
WHAT HAPPENED?

736
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,467
IT'S NO GOOD, SIR.

737
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,593
THERE'S ONLY A FEW SYSTEMS
RESPONDING.

738
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,805
CAPTAIN, WE PULLED
AWAY A LITTLE,

739
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,683
BUT WE GAINED...
MAYBE AN HOUR...

740
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:45,146
BUT WE BLEW ALMOST
EVERY SYSTEM IN
THE SHIP DOING IT.

741
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,106
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
TO TRY AGAIN.

742
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,401
I GUESS YOU'LL
HAVE TO FIRE ME, SIR.

743
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,236
YOU'RE FIRED.

744
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,244
400 PEOPLE...

745
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,703
JIM...

746
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,789
THEY'LL DIE
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
SEE A WARNING SIGN.

747
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:07,668
I HAD TO
FOLLOW ORDERS,
ALWAYS ORDERS.

748
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,587
[GONG SOUNDS IN DISTANCE]

749
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,304
GET BACK IN THERE!

750
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,932
A FINE TIME TO RING
THE DINNER BELL.

751
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,601
GET BACK
IN THERE NOW!

752
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,228
BONES, THAT'S IT.

753
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,563
Chekov: BACK IN THERE. GO.

754
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,356
STAY WITH CHEKOV.

755
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,649
KEEP THOSE PEOPLE
FROM FEEDING VAAL.

756
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,735
DON'T LET THEM
FEED VAAL!

757
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,779
KEEP THEM
IN THE HUT.

758
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,655
MR. SPOCK.

759
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:43,955
SCOTTY, DO YOU STILL
HAVE PHASER POWER?

760
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,831
AYE, BUT WHAT--

761
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,917
LOCK ALL BANKS ON
THE COORDINATES
OF THE ENERGY FIELD

762
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,212
YOU LOCATED DOWN HERE.

763
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:55,300
ON MY COMMAND,
COMMENCE FIRING
ON THOSE COORDINATES.

764
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:58,595
AYE, SIR, BUT
THEY WON'T PENETRATE
THAT FORCE FIELD.

765
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,598
IF MY GUESS IS CORRECT,
THEY WON'T HAVE TO.
STAND BY.

766
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,393
VAAL CALLS TO US.

767
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,563
LET US GO TO HIM.
HE HUNGERS.

768
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,064
PLEASE.

769
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,569
READINGS ARE GETTING
WEAKER, CAPTAIN.

770
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,446
WIDE VARIATION
IN ENERGY TRANSMISSIONS,

771
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,491
AS THOUGH VAAL
WERE TRYING TO DRAW
ON OTHER SOURCES.

772
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:20,908
TAPPING
ITS ENERGY CELLS.

773
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,410
I WOULD ASSUME SO.

774
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,204
GOOD. THE SHIP'S
PULLING AWAY MUST
HAVE WEAKENED IT

775
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,998
CONSIDERING
IT HAS TO BE FED,

776
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,792
BUT ITS RESERVE CAPACITY
COULD HOLD OUT FOR DAYS.

777
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,796
IF IT HAD TO REINFORCE
ITS ENERGY FIELD TO WARD
OFF A PHASER ATTACK,

778
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,632
IT WOULD HAVE TO
DRAW MORE HEAVILY
ON ITS RESERVES.

779
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,258
MY PLAN EXACTLY.

780
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,427
SCOTTY.

781
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,512
SCOTT HERE, SIR.

782
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,806
SCOTTY, COMMENCE FIRING
AND MAINTAIN.

783
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:49,604
MR. KYLE, ALL PHASERS
COMMENCE FIRING.

784
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:04,785
TREMENDOUS UPSURGE
IN GENERATED POWER,
CAPTAIN.

785
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,459
OBVIOUSLY, VAAL IS
TRYING TO REINFORCE
HIS ENERGY FIELD.

786
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,628
GOOD.
LET'S SEE HOW LONG
HE CAN DO IT.

787
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,930
[THUNDER]

788
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,347
Kirk:
SCOTTY! CEASE FIRE!

789
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:38,087
NO POWER GENERATION
AT ALL, CAPTAIN.

790
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,756
VAAL IS DEAD.

791
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,550
MR. SCOTT,
STATUS REPORT.

792
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:46,845
TRACTOR BEAM GONE.

793
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,805
POTENCY RETURNING
TO ANTIMATTER PODS.

794
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,309
I'LL HAVE ALL ENGINEERING
SECTIONS WORKING ON
THE CIRCUITS IMMEDIATELY.

795
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,645
TRANSPORTER WILL
BE READY IN AN HOUR.

796
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,229
SCOTTY, YOU'RE REHIRED.

797
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,981
AS SOON AS
THE TRANSPORTER'S FIXED,

798
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,692
FORM AN ENGINEERING
DETAIL WITH FULL
ANALYTICAL EQUIPMENT

799
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,360
AND BEAM THEM DOWN.

800
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:02,027
KIRK OUT.

801
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,447
CHEKOV, BONES...

802
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,031
LET THOSE PEOPLE GO.

803
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:12,538
BUT IT WAS VAAL WHO...

804
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,957
PUT THE FRUIT
ON THE TREES,

805
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,959
CAUSED THE RAIN TO FALL.

806
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,796
VAAL...

807
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,422
CARED FOR US.

808
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,425
YOU'LL LEARN TO CARE
FOR YOURSELVES
WITH OUR HELP.

809
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,303
AND THERE'S NO TRICK
TO PUTTING FRUIT
ON TREES.

810
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:28,763
YOU MIGHT EVEN ENJOY IT.

811
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,847
YOU'LL LEARN TO BUILD
FOR YOURSELVES,

812
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,266
THINK FOR YOURSELVES,
WORK FOR YOURSELVES,

813
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,352
AND WHAT YOU CREATE
IS YOURS.

814
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,187
THAT'S WHAT
WE CALL FREEDOM.

815
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,023
YOU'LL LIKE IT A LOT.

816
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,442
AND YOU'LL
LEARN SOMETHING
ABOUT MEN AND WOMEN,

817
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,487
THE WAY THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE--
CARING FOR EACH OTHER,

818
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,365
BEING HAPPY
WITH EACH OTHER, BEING
GOOD TO EACH OTHER.

819
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,743
THAT'S WHAT
WE CALL...LOVE.

820
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,620
YOU'LL LIKE THAT,
TOO, A LOT,

821
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:54,246
YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN.

822
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,665
WHAT ARE CHILDREN?

823
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,917
THE...LITTLE ONES
THAT LOOK LIKE YOU.

824
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:02,421
JUST GO ON
THE WAY YOU'RE GOING.
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

825
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,812
WELL, I DON'T AGREE
WITH YOU AT ALL,
MR. SPOCK.

826
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,480
THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL,
DOCTOR.

827
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,024
HEY, JIM, I WANT YOU
TO HEAR THIS.

828
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,527
CAPTAIN,
I'M NOT AT ALL CERTAIN
WE DID THE CORRECT THING

829
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,404
ON GAMMA TRIANGULI 6.

830
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:29,198
WE PUT THOSE PEOPLE
BACK ON A NORMAL COURSE
OF SOCIAL EVOLUTION.

831
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,825
I SEE NOTHING WRONG
IN THAT.

832
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,244
WELL, THAT'S
A GOOD OBJECT
LESSON, MR. SPOCK,

833
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:37,081
AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN
HAPPEN WHEN A MACHINE
BECOMES TOO EFFICIENT,

834
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,291
DOES TOO MUCH WORK
FOR YOU.

835
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,211
CAPTAIN, YOU ARE AWARE
OF THE BIBLICAL STORY
OF "GENESIS."

836
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,672
YES, OF COURSE. I'M
AWARE THAT ADAM AND EVE
TASTED THE APPLE

837
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,132
AND AS A RESULT
WERE DRIVEN
OUT OF PARADISE.

838
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,384
PRECISELY, CAPTAIN,

839
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:49,677
AND IN A MANNER
OF SPEAKING,

840
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:52,680
WE HAVE GIVEN
THE PEOPLE OF VAAL
THE APPLE,

841
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,682
THE KNOWLEDGE
OF GOOD AND EVIL,
IF YOU WILL,

842
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:58,060
AS A RESULT OF WHICH
THEY, TOO, HAVE BEEN
DRIVEN OUT OF PARADISE.

843
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,646
DOCTOR,
DO I UNDERSTAND
HIM CORRECTLY?

844
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:04,149
ARE YOU CASTING ME
IN THE ROLE OF SATAN?

845
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,651
NOT AT ALL, CAPTAIN.

846
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:08,654
IS THERE ANYONE
ON THIS SHIP WHO
EVEN REMOTELY...

847
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,032
LOOKS LIKE SATAN?

848
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,788
I AM NOT AWARE
OF ANYONE

849
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:18,497
WHO FITS THAT DESCRIPTION,
CAPTAIN.

850
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,458
NO, MR. SPOCK,
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD.
