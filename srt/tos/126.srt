1
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,224
CAPTAIN, WE'VE REACHED
THE DESIGNATED POSITION

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,392
FOR SCANNING
THE CODED DIRECTIVE.

3
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,102
GOOD.

4
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,861
WE'VE BOTH
GUESSED RIGHT.

5
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,362
NEGOTIATIONS WITH
THE KLINGON EMPIRE

6
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,405
ARE ON THE VERGE
OF BREAKING DOWN.

7
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:35,118
STARFLEET COMMAND
ANTICIPATES
A SURPRISE ATTACK.

8
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,496
WE ARE TO PROCEED
TO ORGANIA

9
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,666
AND TAKE WHATEVER
STEPS ARE NECESSARY

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,835
TO PREVENT
THE KLINGONS

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,420
FROM USING IT
AS A BASE.

12
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,255
STRATEGICALLY SOUND.

13
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,257
ORGANIA IS THE ONLY
CLASS "M" PLANET

14
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,342
IN THE DISPUTED AREA,

15
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,761
IDEALLY LOCATED
FOR USE BY EITHER SIDE.

16
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:57,265
ORGANIA'S DESCRIPTION,
MR. SPOCK.

17
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,518
INHABITED
BY HUMANOIDS,

18
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,437
A VERY PEACEFUL,
FRIENDLY PEOPLE

19
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,105
LIVING ON
A PRIMITIVE LEVEL.

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,649
LITTLE OF
INTRINSIC VALUE.

21
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,860
APPROXIMATELY
CLASS "D-"

22
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,152
ON RICHTER'S SCALE
OF CULTURES.

23
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,822
ANOTHER ARMENIA, BELGIUM.

24
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,114
SIR?

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,950
THE WEAK INNOCENTS.

26
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,369
THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO BE
LOCATED ON THE NATURAL
INVASION ROUTES.

27
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,788
CAPTAIN, THE AUTOMATIC DEFLECTOR
SCREEN JUST POPPED ON.

28
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:20,956
BODY APPROACHING.

29
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,416
CONFIGURATION,
MR. SULU.

30
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:36,055
PHASER BANKS. LOCK ON.
RETURN FIRE.

31
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,813
MAINTAIN FIRING RANGE.

32
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,857
100% DISPERSAL PATTERN.

33
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,195
WE'VE HIT HIM, CAPTAIN.
HE'S HURT.

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,115
DAMAGE CONTROL, REPORT
TO THE FIRST OFFICER.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,618
CAPTAIN, THE OTHER SHIP
DOESN'T REGISTER.

36
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,828
ONLY DRIFTING DEBRIS.

37
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,080
WE GOT HIM.

38
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,749
ALL HANDS,
MAINTAIN GENERAL ALERT.

39
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,292
HOLD BATTLE STATIONS.

40
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,877
DAMAGE REPORT, MR. SPOCK.

41
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,336
MINOR, CAPTAIN.
WE WERE MOST FORTUNATE.

42
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,965
BLAST DAMAGE
IN DECKS 10 AND 11.

43
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,676
MINOR BUCKLING
IN THE ANTI-MATTER PODS.
CASUALTIES ARE LIGHT.

44
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,053
MAINTAIN SURVEILLANCE,
MR. SULU.

45
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,512
NO CONTACT, CAPTAIN.
HE BLEW UP, ALL RIGHT.

46
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,765
WELL, WE'VE BEEN
ANTICIPATING
AN ATTACK.

47
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,516
I'D SAY WHAT WE'VE
JUST EXPERIENCED

48
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,601
VERY
NEARLY QUALIFIES.

49
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,313
YES. IT WOULD SEEM TO BE
AN UNFRIENDLY ACT.

50
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,148
AUTOMATIC
ALL-POINTS RELAY

51
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,651
FROM STARFLEET COMMAND,
CAPTAIN. CODE 1.

52
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,406
WELL, THERE IT IS--

53
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,908
WAR.

54
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,828
WE DIDN'T WANT IT,
BUT WE'VE GOT IT.

55
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,454
CURIOUS
HOW OFTEN YOU HUMANS

56
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,706
MANAGE TO OBTAIN THAT
WHICH YOU DO NOT WANT.

57
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,793
WAR OR NOT,
WE'VE STILL GOT
A JOB TO DO--

58
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,837
DENYING ORGANIA
TO THE KLINGONS.

59
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,005
WITH THE OUTBREAK
OF HOSTILITIES,

60
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,339
THAT MIGHT NOT BE EASY.

61
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,716
LAY IN A COURSE FOR
ORGANIA, MR. SULU.

62
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,010
AYE, AYE, SIR.

63
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,804
NEGOTIATING WITH THE ORGANIANS
WILL BE TIME-CONSUMING, CAPTAIN.

64
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,180
AND TIME IS THE ONE THING
WE'LL HAVE THE LEAST OF.

65
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,600
WELL, WE WON'T
GET IT BY TALKING
ABOUT IT, MR. SPOCK.

66
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,685
THE TRIGGER
HAS BEEN PULLED.

67
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,354
WE'VE GOT TO GET THERE
BEFORE THE HAMMER FALLS.

68
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,647
AHEAD WARP FACTOR 7.

69
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,123
SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

70
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:30,335
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE.

71
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,419
ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--

72
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:35,256
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

73
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,635
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,140
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

75
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,550
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 3198.4.

76
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,509
WE HAVE REACHED ORGANIA

77
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,720
AND ESTABLISHED
STANDARD ORBIT.

78
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,555
NO SIGNS OF HOSTILE
ACTIVITIES IN THIS AREA.

79
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:25,724
CAPTAIN...

80
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,144
UNIT X-Y 75847
REPORT A FLEET
OF KLINGON SHIPS

81
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,938
IN THEIR SECTOR,
SIR.

82
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,313
WHAT BEARING?

83
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,690
UNABLE
TO ASCERTAIN, SIR.

84
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,109
MR. SULU,
HAVE THE PHASER CREWS

85
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,693
STAND BY THEIR POSITIONS.

86
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,903
FULL POWER
DEFLECTOR SCREENS.

87
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,487
YES, SIR.

88
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,406
MR. SPOCK AND I
ARE GOING DOWN

89
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,491
TO THE PLANET'S SURFACE.
YOU WILL BE IN COMMAND.

90
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,493
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
IS TO THE ENTERPRISE,

91
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,912
NOT TO US.
IS THAT CLEAR?

92
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,038
PERFECTLY, SIR.

93
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,581
THE KLINGON FLEET
IS IN THIS QUADRANT.

94
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,126
WE KNOW THAT ORGANIA
WILL BE A TARGET.

95
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,835
IF THEY SHOULD EMERGE--

96
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,295
WE'LL HANDLE THEM, SIR.

97
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,798
YOU WILL EVALUATE
THE SITUATION.

98
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,841
IF THERE IS
A FLEET OF THEM,

99
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,676
YOU'LL GET OUT
OF HERE, MR. SULU.

100
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,928
BUT, CAPTAIN--

101
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,179
NO BUTS.

102
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,306
YOU'LL GET TO SAFETY
AND ALERT THE FLEET.

103
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,809
YOU WILL NOT ATTACK
ALONE.

104
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,019
MR. SPOCK AND I
WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

105
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:16,275
MR. SPOCK,
LET'S YOU AND I

106
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,526
PAY THE ORGANIANS
A VISIT.

107
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,880
YOU'D THINK THEY HAD PEOPLE
BEAMING DOWN EVERY DAY.

108
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,758
YES. CURIOUS
LACK OF INTEREST.

109
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,931
NOTICE THE RUINS IN
THE DISTANCE, CAPTAIN.

110
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,308
QUITE LARGE.

111
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,518
YES. A FORTRESS, PERHAPS.
A CASTLE.

112
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,770
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT WOULD SEEM
TO BE INCONSISTENT

113
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,605
WITH THE REPORTS
WE'VE BEEN GIVEN
ON THIS CULTURE.

114
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,526
WELCOME.

115
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,903
RECEPTION COMMITTEE?

116
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,738
SEEMS SO.

117
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:14,749
YOU ARE OUR VISITORS.
WELCOME. WELCOME.

118
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,711
I AM AYELBORNE.

119
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,630
I AM CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK
OF THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE,

120
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,300
REPRESENTING THE UNITED
FEDERATION OF PLANETS.

121
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,426
THIS IS MY FIRST OFFICER
MR. SPOCK.

122
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,471
YOU'RE MOST WELCOME,
MY FRIEND.

123
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,265
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK
TO SOMEONE IN AUTHORITY.

124
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,519
WE...WE DON'T HAVE
ANYBODY IN AUTHORITY,

125
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,105
BUT I AM THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS.

126
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,397
PERHAPS I WOULD DO.

127
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,650
YOU PEOPLE ARE
IN GREAT DANGER.

128
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,361
IS THERE SOMEPLACE
WE CAN GO AND TALK?

129
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,613
OH, YES. OUR COUNCIL CHAMBERS
ARE NEARBY. PLEASE.

130
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,083
CAPTAIN,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

131
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,335
I SHOULD LIKE TO WANDER
ABOUT THE VILLAGE

132
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,087
AND MAKE SOME STUDIES.

133
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,257
OF COURSE, MY FRIEND.
OUR VILLAGE IS YOURS.

134
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,759
CAPTAIN.

135
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,440
GENTLEMEN, MY GOVERNMENT
HAS INFORMED ME

136
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,944
THAT THE KLINGONS
ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE
AGAINST YOUR PLANET

137
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,696
WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MAKING IT
A BASE OF OPERATION

138
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,323
AGAINST THE FEDERATION.

139
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,285
MY MISSION, FRANKLY, IS...

140
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,578
TO KEEP THEM
FROM DOING IT.

141
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,707
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, CAPTAIN,
IS THAT WE SEEM TO HAVE A CHOICE

142
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,293
BETWEEN DEALING WITH YOU
OR YOUR ENEMIES.

143
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,543
NO, SIR.

144
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,130
WITH THE FEDERATION,
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

145
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,923
YOU HAVE NONE
WITH THE KLINGONS.

146
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,716
THE KLINGONS ARE
A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP.

147
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,762
WAR IS THEIR WAY OF LIFE.

148
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:55,142
LIFE UNDER THE KLINGON RULE
WOULD BE VERY UNPLEASANT.

149
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,851
WE OFFER YOU PROTECTION.

150
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,604
WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR
ALTRUISTIC OFFER, CAPTAIN,

151
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,399
BUT WE REALLY DO NOT
NEED YOUR PROTECTION.

152
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,068
WE ARE A SIMPLE
PEOPLE, CAPTAIN.

153
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,528
WE HAVE NOTHING
THAT ANYBODY COULD WANT.

154
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,031
YOU HAVE THIS PLANET AND
ITS STRATEGIC LOCATION.

155
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:14,995
I ASSURE YOU THAT
IF YOU DON'T TAKE
ACTION TO PREVENT IT,

156
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,704
THE KLINGONS
WILL MOVE AGAINST YOU

157
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,999
JUST AS SURELY
AS YOUR SUN RISES.

158
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,336
WE WILL HELP YOU
BUILD DEFENSES,
BUILD FACILITIES.

159
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,588
WE HAVE NO DEFENSES,
CAPTAIN, NOR ARE ANY NEEDED.

160
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,592
GENTLEMEN...

161
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,139
I HAVE SEEN
WHAT THE KLINGONS DO

162
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,932
TO PLANETS LIKE YOURS.

163
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,560
THEY ARE ORGANIZED INTO
VAST SLAVE LABOR CAMPS.

164
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,104
NO FREEDOMS WHATSOEVER.

165
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,730
YOUR GOODS
WILL BE CONFISCATED.

166
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,276
HOSTAGES TAKEN, KILLED.
YOUR LEADERS CONFINED.

167
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,695
BE FAR BETTER OFF
ON A PENAL PLANET.

168
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,280
INFINITELY BETTER OFF.

169
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,323
CAPTAIN, WE SEE
THAT YOUR CONCERN

170
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,075
IS GENUINE.
WE ARE MOVED.

171
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:58,038
BUT AGAIN WE ASSURE YOU THAT WE
ARE IN ABSOLUTELY NO DANGER.

172
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,290
IF ANYBODY'S IN DANGER,
YOU ARE.

173
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,668
THAT CONCERNS US GREATLY.
IT WOULD BE BETTER

174
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,004
IF YOU RETURNED TO YOUR SHIP
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

175
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,088
YOU KEEP INSISTING
THAT THERE'S NO DANGER.

176
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,674
I KEEP ASSURING YOU
THAT THERE IS. WOULD YOU
MIND TELLING ME--

177
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,135
IT IS OUR WAY OF LIFE,
CAPTAIN.

178
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,554
THAT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT WOULD BE LOST.

179
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,434
EXCUSE ME.

180
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,103
I'M A SOLDIER,
NOT A DIPLOMAT.

181
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,481
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU
THE TRUTH.

182
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,276
IF YOU WILL
EXCUSE US, CAPTAIN,

183
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,320
WE WILL DISCUSS
YOUR KIND OFFER.

184
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,531
YES, CERTAINLY.

185
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,086
CAPTAIN, OUR INFORMATION
ON THESE PEOPLE

186
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,296
AND THEIR CULTURE
WAS NOT CORRECT.

187
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,298
THIS IS NOT
A PRIMITIVE SOCIETY

188
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,509
MAKING PROGRESS
TOWARD MECHANIZATION.

189
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,094
THEY ARE
TOTALLY STAGNANT.

190
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,595
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE
OF ANY PROGRESS

191
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,222
AS FAR BACK AS MY
TRICORDER CAN REGISTER.

192
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,266
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY.

193
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,392
NEVERTHELESS,
IT IS TRUE.

194
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,894
FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF YEARS,

195
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,854
THERE HAS BEEN
ABSOLUTELY
NO ADVANCEMENT,

196
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,857
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
IN THEIR PHYSICAL
ENVIRONMENT.

197
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,278
THIS IS
A LABORATORY SPECIMEN
OF AN ARRESTED CULTURE.

198
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,114
THANK YOU, MR. SPOCK.
THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL.

199
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:20,078
WE HAVE DISCUSSED
YOUR OFFER, CAPTAIN,

200
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,122
AND OUR OPINION
IS UNCHANGED.

201
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,040
WE ARE IN NO DANGER.

202
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,084
WE THANK YOU FOR
YOUR KIND OFFER
OF ASSISTANCE,

203
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,752
ALTHOUGH WE MUST
DECLINE IT,

204
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,546
AND WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND
THAT YOU LEAVE ORGANIA

205
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,590
BEFORE YOU YOURSELVES
ARE ENDANGERED.

206
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,384
GENTLEMEN, I MUST
GET YOU TO RECONSIDER.

207
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,344
WE CAN BE OF IMMENSE
HELP TO YOU.

208
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,513
IN ADDITION
TO MILITARY AID,

209
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,932
WE CAN SEND YOU
SPECIALISTS, TECHNICIANS.

210
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,351
WE CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO
FEED A THOUSAND PEOPLE

211
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,936
WHERE ONE WAS FED BEFORE.

212
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,355
WE CAN HELP YOU BUILD
SCHOOLS, EDUCATE THE YOUNG

213
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,690
IN THE LATEST TECHNOLOGICAL
AND SCIENTIFIC SKILLS.

214
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,487
YOUR PUBLIC FACILITIES
ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT.

215
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,948
WE CAN HELP YOU
REMAKE YOUR WORLD,

216
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,700
END DISEASE,
HUNGER, HARDSHIP.

217
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,287
AND ALL WE ASK IN RETURN

218
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,788
IS THAT
YOU LET US HELP YOU...

219
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,957
NOW.

220
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,712
CAPTAIN, I CAN SEE
THAT YOU DO NOT
UNDERSTAND US.

221
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,298
[COMMUNICATOR BEEPS]

222
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,342
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
KIRK HERE.

223
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,511
[SULU] CAPTAIN,
A LARGE NUMBER

224
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,678
OF KLINGON VESSELS
HAVE JUST ARRIVED.

225
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,098
THEY'RE OPENING FIRE.

226
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,350
[KIRK] POSITIVE
IDENTIFICATION?

227
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,226
YES, SIR.
MY SCREENS ARE UP.

228
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,270
I CAN'T DROP THEM
TO BEAM YOU ABOARD.

229
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,855
MR. SULU,
FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS.

230
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,731
GET OUT OF HERE.
CONTACT THE FLEET.

231
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,652
RETURN IF THE ODDS
ARE MORE EQUAL.
KIRK OUT.

232
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,903
GENTLEMEN, YOU KEPT
INSISTING THAT THERE
WAS NO DANGER--

233
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,696
THAT IS CORRECT, CAPTAIN.
THERE IS NO DANGER.

234
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,781
AYELBORNE.

235
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,285
8 SPACE VEHICLES
HAVE ASSUMED ORBIT
AROUND OUR PLANET.

236
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,872
THEY ARE ACTIVATING
THEIR MATERIAL
TRANSMISSION UNITS.

237
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,748
THANK YOU, TREFAYNE.

238
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,459
CAN YOU
VERIFY THAT?

239
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,879
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN,
BUT IT SEEMS A LOGICAL
DEVELOPMENT.

240
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,797
CAPTAIN, SINCE IT IS
TOO LATE FOR YOU TO ESCAPE,

241
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,716
PERHAPS WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING
ABOUT PROTECTING YOU.

242
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,594
IF YOU HAD
LISTENED TO ME--

243
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:03,014
WE MUST BE SURE THAT
YOU ARE NOT HARMED.

244
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,391
AYELBORNE,
SEVERAL HUNDRED MEN

245
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,476
HAVE APPEARED
NEAR THE CITADEL.

246
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,187
THEY BRING
MANY WEAPONS.

247
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,273
HOW DOES HE KNOW THAT?

248
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,942
OH, OUR FRIEND TREFAYNE
IS REALLY QUITE INTUITIVE.

249
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,903
YOU CAN REST ASSURED

250
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,530
THAT WHAT HE SAYS
IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

251
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,618
SO, WE'RE STRANDED HERE

252
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,705
IN THE MIDDLE
OF A KLINGON OCCUPATION ARMY.

253
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,289
SO IT WOULD SEEM.

254
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,874
NOT A VERY
PLEASANT PROSPECT.

255
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,834
YOU HAVE A GIFT
FOR UNDERSTATEMENT,
MR. SPOCK.

256
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,588
IT'S NOT A VERY
PLEASANT PROSPECT AT ALL.

257
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,801
CAPTAIN'S LOG--
STARDATE 3201.7.

258
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,222
MR. SPOCK AND I
ARE TRAPPED ON
THE PLANET ORGANIA,

259
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,224
WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS
OF BEING OCCUPIED

260
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,602
BY THE FORCES
OF THE KLINGON EMPIRE.

261
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,229
THE ORGANIANS
HAVE PROVIDED US
WITH NATIVE CLOTHING

262
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,897
IN THE HOPES WE MAY BE
TAKEN FOR ORGANIANS.

263
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,067
CAPTAIN, OUR PHASERS
ARE GONE.

264
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,776
DID YOU TAKE THEM?

265
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,778
YES, CAPTAIN,
I TOOK THEM.

266
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,115
I MUST ASK YOU
TO RETURN THEM.

267
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,866
I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN.
I CANNOT DO THAT.

268
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,203
WERE YOU ARMED, YOU MIGHT
BE TEMPTED TO USE VIOLENCE,

269
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,538
AND THAT
WE CANNOT PERMIT.

270
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,625
YOU, CAPTAIN, WILL PASS
AS AN ORGANIAN,

271
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,419
AND MR. SPOCK...

272
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,421
MR. SPOCK PRESENTS
A PROBLEM.

273
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,090
HE DOES NOT LOOK
LIKE AN ORGANIAN.

274
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,426
A VULCAN TRADER PERHAPS,

275
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,678
A DEALER IN KEVOSS
AND TRILIUM,

276
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,055
HARMLESS TO THE KLINGONS.

277
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,682
THEY KNOW THAT
VULCAN WAS A MEMBER
OF THE FEDERATION.

278
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,311
VULCAN MERCHANTS
ARE NOT UNCOMMON, CAPTAIN.

279
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,438
IT IS A PRACTICAL
APPROACH.

280
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,440
WHAT ABOUT
THE REST OF YOU?

281
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,609
WE SHOULD CONTINUE
AS BEFORE.

282
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,403
WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.

283
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,197
YOU HAVE A LOT
TO LEARN...SIR.

284
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,451
AND IF I KNOW
THE KLINGONS,

285
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,870
YOU'LL BE LEARNING IT
THE HARD WAY.

286
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,762
THIS IS
THE RULING COUNCIL?

287
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,474
I AM AYELBORNE,
TEMPORARY HEAD
OF THE COUNCIL.

288
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,849
I BID YOU WELCOME.

289
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,852
NO DOUBT YOU DO.

290
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:18,024
I AM KOR, MILITARY
GOVERNOR OF ORGANIA.

291
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,569
WHO ARE YOU?

292
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,197
HE IS BARONA,
ONE OF OUR LEADING CITIZENS.

293
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,324
AND HE HAS NO TONGUE?

294
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,035
I HAVE A TONGUE.

295
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,329
GOOD.

296
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,458
YOU WILL BE TAUGHT
HOW TO USE IT.

297
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,629
WHERE IS YOUR SMILE?

298
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,715
MY WHAT?

299
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,886
THE STUPID, IDIOTIC
SMILE EVERYONE ELSE
SEEMS TO BE WEARING.

300
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,891
A VULCAN.

301
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,270
DO YOU ALSO
HAVE A TONGUE?

302
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,735
I AM SPOCK, A DEALER
IN KEVOSS AND TRILIUM.

303
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,404
YOU DO NOT LOOK
LIKE A STOREKEEPER.

304
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,946
TAKE THIS MAN.

305
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,990
VULCANS ARE MEMBERS
OF THE FEDERATION.

306
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,283
HE MAY BE A SPY.

307
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,244
HE'S NO SPY.

308
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,627
WELL...HAVE WE
A RAM AMONG THE SHEEP?

309
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,421
YOU OBJECT TO US
TAKING HIM?

310
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,173
HE'S DONE NOTHING.
NOTHING AT ALL.

311
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,008
COMING FROM AN ORGANIAN,

312
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,970
YOURS IS PRACTICALLY
AN ACT OF REBELLION.

313
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,056
VERY GOOD.

314
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,183
SO YOU WELCOME ME.

315
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,144
DO YOU ALSO WELCOME ME?

316
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,441
YOU'RE HERE.
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

317
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:46,654
GOOD HONEST HATRED.

318
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,032
VERY REFRESHING.

319
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,202
HOWEVER, IT MAKES
NO DIFFERENCE

320
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,788
WHETHER
YOU WELCOME ME OR NOT.

321
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,581
I AM HERE,
AND I WILL STAY.

322
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,584
YOU ARE NOW SUBJECTS
OF THE KLINGON EMPIRE.

323
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,253
YOU'LL FIND THERE ARE
MANY RULES AND REGULATIONS.

324
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,922
THEY WILL BE POSTED.

325
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,216
VIOLATION
OF THE SMALLEST OF THEM

326
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,177
WILL BE PUNISHED
BY DEATH.

327
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,639
WE SHALL OBEY
YOUR REGULATIONS, COMMANDER.

328
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,017
YOU DISAPPROVE, BARONA.

329
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,812
YOU NEED MY APPROVAL?

330
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,522
I NEED YOUR OBEDIENCE.

331
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,859
NOTHING MORE.

332
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,862
WILL I HAVE IT?

333
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,617
YOU SEEM TO BE
IN COMMAND.

334
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,410
YES...

335
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,704
I AM.

336
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,582
I SHALL NEED
A REPRESENTATIVE
FROM AMONG YOU,

337
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,294
LIAISON BETWEEN
THE FORCES OF THE OCCUPATION

338
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,463
AND THE CIVIL POPULATION.

339
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,759
SMILE AND SMILE.

340
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:55,264
I DON'T TRUST MEN
WHO SMILE TOO MUCH.

341
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,644
YOU, BARONA,
YOU'RE THE MAN.

342
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,980
ME? I DON'T
WANT THE JOB.

343
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,358
HAVE I ASKED WHETHER
OR NOT YOU WANT IT?

344
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,197
WE KLINGONS HAVE A REPUATION
FOR RUTHLESSNESS.

345
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,741
YOU WILL FIND
THAT IT IS DESERVED.

346
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,203
SHOULD ONE KLINGON
SOLDIER BE KILLED,

347
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:21,666
A THOUSAND ORGANIANS
WILL DIE.

348
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,252
I WILL HAVE ORDER.
IS THAT CLEAR?

349
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,463
COMMANDER,
I ASSURE YOU,

350
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,216
OUR PEOPLE WANT
NOTHING BUT PEACE.

351
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,468
WE SHALL CAUSE YOU
NO TROUBLE.

352
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,388
I'M SURE YOU WILL NOT.

353
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,098
TAKE THE VULCAN
TO THE EXAMINATION ROOM.

354
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,684
YOU, COME WITH ME.

355
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,102
I WILL FAMILIARIZE YOU
WITH YOUR NEW DUTIES.

356
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,855
WHAT ABOUT MR. SPOCK?

357
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,939
YOU ARE CONCERNED.

358
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,440
HE IS MY FRIEND.

359
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,109
YOU HAVE A POOR CHOICE
OF FRIENDS.

360
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,611
HE WILL BE
EXAMINED.

361
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,947
IF HE IS LYING,
HE WILL DIE.

362
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,033
IF HE IS TELLING
THE TRUTH...

363
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:59,286
HE WILL FIND THAT
BUSINESS HAS TAKEN
A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

364
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,248
TAKE HIM.

365
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,631
YOU DO NOT LIKE
TO BE PUSHED.

366
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,303
VERY GOOD.

367
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,808
YOU MAY BE A MAN
I CAN DEAL WITH, BARONA.

368
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,896
COME WITH ME.

369
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,621
"FROM THIS DAY ON,

370
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:45,207
"NO PUBLIC ASSEMBLAGES
OF MORE THAN THREE PEOPLE.

371
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,419
ALL PUBLICATIONS
TO BE CLEARED
THROUGH THIS OFFICE."

372
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,838
"NEIGHBORHOOD CONTROLS
WILL BE ESTABLISHED,

373
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,799
HOSTAGES SELECTED..."

374
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,469
A SOMEWHAT LENGTHY
LIST OF CRIMES
AGAINST THE STATE.

375
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,891
YOU DO NOT
LIKE THEM?

376
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,021
WELL?

377
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,398
HE IS WHAT
HE CLAIMS TO BE,
COMMANDER--

378
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,275
A VULCANIAN MERCHANT
NAMED SPOCK.

379
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,402
HIS MAIN CONCERN
SEEMS TO BE

380
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,195
HOW HE WOULD CARRY
OUT HIS BUSINESS

381
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,031
UNDER
OUR OCCUPATION.

382
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,951
NOTHING ELSE?

383
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,995
THE USUAL--

384
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,622
A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF APPREHENSION
REGARDING US.

385
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,958
HIS MIND
IS REMARKABLY
DISCIPLINED.

386
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,335
YOU ARE SURE?

387
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,711
I USED FORCE 4...

388
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,548
WHICH IS SUFFICIENT
TO BREAK DOWN ANY PRETENSE.

389
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,884
VERY WELL,
LIEUTENANT.

390
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,013
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TRY OUR LITTLE
TRUTH FINDER?

391
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,056
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

392
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,100
IT'S A MIND SIFTER...

393
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,019
OR MIND RIPPER,

394
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,188
DEPENDING ON
HOW MUCH FORCE IS USED.

395
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,357
WE CAN RECORD
EVERY THOUGHT...

396
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,527
EVERY BIT OF KNOWLEDGE
IN A MAN'S MIND.

397
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,114
OF COURSE, WHEN
THAT MUCH FORCE IS USED,

398
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,240
THE MIND IS EMPTIED...

399
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,827
PERMANENTLY, I'M AFRAID.

400
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:06,789
WHAT'S LEFT IS MORE
VEGETABLE THAN HUMAN.

401
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,666
AND YOU'RE PROUD OF IT.

402
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,417
IT IS A TOOL...

403
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,544
A WEAPON.

404
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:16,132
SOMEWHAT DRASTIC,
BUT VERY EFFICIENT.

405
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,758
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

406
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,845
PERFECTLY, BARONA.

407
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,263
BUT IT WAS
AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE.

408
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,141
ALL RIGHT, VULCAN,
YOU MAY GO.

409
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,810
BUT YOU ARE
AN ENEMY ALIEN.

410
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,271
YOU WILL BE
UNDER OUR SCRUTINY
AT ALL TIMES.

411
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,817
IF I HAVE TO
WARN YOU...

412
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,612
NOT NECESSARY, COMMANDER.
I UNDERSTAND YOU...

413
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,573
VERY WELL.

414
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,413
RETURN TO YOUR COUNCIL,
BARONA.

415
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,415
YOU WILL RECEIVE OUR
OFFICIAL NOTIFICATIONS

416
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,042
AS SOON AS THEY
ARE PUBLISHED.

417
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,334
IN THE MEANTIME...

418
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:56,797
KEEP THE PEOPLE
IN ORDER.

419
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,592
IT IS
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

420
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,763
OR I WILL BE KILLED.

421
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,891
THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

422
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,686
YOU WILL BE KILLED.

423
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,233
THAT MIND SIFTER
CAN'T BE ALL THE TERROR
THEY THINK IT IS.

424
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,984
IT SHOULD NOT BE
UNDERESTIMATED, CAPTAIN.

425
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,444
IT REACHES DIRECTLY
INTO THE MIND.

426
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,572
WE VULCANS HAVE
CERTAIN MENTAL--

427
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:26,827
CERTAIN DISCIPLINES
WHICH ENABLE ME TO
MAINTAIN A SHIELD.

428
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,704
WITHOUT THOSE DISCIPLINES,
THERE WOULD BE NO PROTECTION.

429
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,207
I'LL TRY
AND AVOID IT.

430
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,542
OUT OF THE WAY,
ORGANIAN.

431
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,628
I'M SORRY, SIR.
WE DID NOT NOTICE YOU.

432
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:36,921
NEXT TIME,
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN,

433
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,423
OR I'LL SHUT THEM
PERMANENTLY.

434
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,842
CAPTAIN,
I STRONGLY SUGGEST

435
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,220
WE DIRECT OUR ENERGIES
TOWARD THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM--

436
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,763
ACCOMPLISHING
OUR MISSION HERE.

437
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,223
YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK
I WAS GOING TO

438
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,557
BEAT HIS HEAD IN,
DID YOU?

439
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,226
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

440
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,356
BUT AS YOU SAY,
WE STILL HAVE A JOB TO DO.

441
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,984
WE'LL RECEIVE NO HELP
FROM THE ORGANIANS.

442
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,527
MAYBE, BUT SOONER OR LATER,
THEY'RE GOING TO START RESENTING

443
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,196
HOW THE KLINGONS
RUN THINGS.

444
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,530
IF WE COULD PROVE
TO THEM...

445
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,992
THEY COULD DO SOMETHING
TO STRIKE BACK,

446
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,660
TO KEEP THE KLINGONS
OFF BALANCE.

447
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,997
VERBAL PERSUASION
SEEMS TO BE INEFFECTIVE.

448
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,874
PERHAPS A MORE
DIRECT APPROACH.

449
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,668
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

450
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,420
MR. SPOCK, DID I
OR DID I NOT SEE SOMETHING

451
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,922
THAT LOOKED LIKE
A MUNITIONS DUMP

452
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,049
OUTSIDE
OF KOR'S HEADQUARTERS?

453
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:22,967
YOU DID.

454
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,426
I THINK IT'S TIME

455
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,429
WE DID A LITTLE
SIMPLE AND PLAIN
COMMUNICATING. TONIGHT.

456
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,224
A VERY MERITORIOUS IDEA,
CAPTAIN.

457
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,185
WE'RE SHORT OF TOOLS.

458
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,562
I'M CERTAIN THE KLINGONS
WILL PROVIDE WHATEVER
IS NECESSARY.

459
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,024
IT'S A PLEASURE
DOING BUSINESS
WITH YOU, MR. SPOCK.

460
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,604
O.K. SO FAR.

461
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,232
SONIC GRENADE.

462
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,607
WITH A DELAYED-ACTION FUSE.

463
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,400
GOOD.

464
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,402
THESE CRATES CONTAIN
CHEMICAL EXPLOSIVES.

465
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,572
THEY SHOULD MAKE A MOST
SATISFACTORY DISPLAY.

466
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,576
6...5...4...3...

467
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,954
[EXPLOSION]

468
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,220
YOU WERE RIGHT,
MR. SPOCK.

469
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,723
A MOST SATISFACTORY
DISPLAY.

470
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,810
OF COURSE WE BLEW IT UP.
DELIBERATELY.

471
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,645
BUT THAT
WAS VIOLENCE.

472
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,939
WE DID IT TO SHOW YOU
THAT YOU COULD FIGHT BACK,

473
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,815
THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE SHEEP.
YOU CAN BE WOLVES.

474
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:02,983
TERRIBLE...

475
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,195
TO DESTROY.

476
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,780
HISTORY IS FULL
OF EXAMPLES

477
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,323
OF CIVIL POPULATIONS
FIGHTING BACK
SUCCESSFULLY

478
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,658
AGAINST A MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP.

479
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,994
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO DESTROY THE KLINGONS,

480
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,622
BUT IF WE CAN TIE THEM UP,
BLOW UP THEIR INSTALLATIONS,

481
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:17,957
DISRUPT
THEIR COMMUNICATIONS,

482
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,209
MAKE ORGANIA
USELESS TO THEM--

483
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,544
OUR FLEET WILL
EVENTUALLY ARRIVE.

484
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,297
IN THE MEANTIME,
THE BATTLE IS OURS.

485
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,133
IT CAN BE
A SUCCESSFUL ONE.

486
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,635
CAPTAIN,
I IMPLORE YOU

487
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,345
NEVER TO DO
SUCH A THING AGAIN.

488
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,974
WHY? ARE YOU AFRAID
OF RETRIBUTION?

489
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,559
DOES YOUR PERSONAL FREEDOM
MEAN SO LITTLE TO YOU?

490
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,686
HOW LITTLE YOU
UNDERSTAND US, CAPTAIN.

491
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,647
ALL I UNDERSTAND IS THAT
YOU APPRENTLY DON'T HAVE

492
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,815
THE BACKBONE
TO STAND UP AND FIGHT

493
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,733
AND PROTECT
THE ONES YOU LOVE.

494
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,778
YOU SPEAK OF COURAGE,
GENTLEMEN.

495
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,156
DOES COURAGE
MEAN SO LITTLE TO YOU?

496
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,455
[FOOTSTEPS]

497
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,583
YOU SPEAK
OF COURAGE.

498
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,461
OBVIOUSLY
YOU DO NOT KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE

499
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:08,257
BETWEEN COURAGE
AND FOOLHARDINESS.

500
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:15,264
ALWAYS IT IS
THE BRAVE ONES WHO DIE,

501
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,224
THE SOLDIERS.

502
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,477
I HOPE YOU WILL
CONTINUE TO SAVOR

503
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:23,189
THE SWEETNESS
OF YOUR LIFE.

504
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,483
YOU DISGUST ME.

505
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,734
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
DO WITH HIM, COMMANDER?

506
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,612
WHAT IS ALWAYS
DONE WITH SPIES
AND SABOTEURS.

507
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,198
HE WILL BE KILLED

508
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:37,244
AFTER HE HAS HAD
FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE

509
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,038
OF OUR MIND SCANNER.

510
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,998
THERE'S NO NEED TO USE
YOUR MACHINE ON HIM, COMMANDER.

511
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,333
I CAN TELL YOU
HIS NAME.

512
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,418
IT IS CAPTAIN
JAMES T. KIRK.

513
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,087
AYELBORNE.
WHAT?

514
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:56,805
CAPTAIN OF
THE U.S.S. ENTERPRISE.

515
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,850
A STARSHIP COMMANDER.

516
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:04,063
AND HIS FIRST OFFICER?

517
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,022
HMM.

518
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,817
I HAD HOPED TO MEET YOU
IN BATTLE, BUT...

519
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,987
FOR SOME REASON, HE FEELS THAT
HE MUST DESTROY YOU, COMMANDER,

520
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,407
JUST AS YOU FEEL
YOU MUST DESTROY HIM.

521
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,537
THAT'S GOING TO BE
RATHER DIFFICULT NOW.

522
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,579
ISN'T IT, CAPTAIN?

523
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:33,008
WHAT AN ADMIRABLE
PEOPLE.

524
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,762
DO YOU ALWAYS
BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS?

525
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,138
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO HARM HIM.

526
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:41,808
I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN.
IT WAS FOR THE BEST.

527
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,769
NO HARM
WILL COME OF IT.

528
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,979
I'M USED TO
THE IDEA OF DYING.

529
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,815
BUT I HAVE
NO DESIRE TO DIE

530
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,317
FOR THE LIKES OF YOU.

531
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,821
I DON'T BLAME YOU,
CAPTAIN.

532
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,990
LOCK UP THE VULCAN.

533
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,993
TAKE THE CAPTAIN
TO MY OFFICE.

534
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,704
WE'LL HAVE A TALK

535
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,040
BEFORE I DO WHAT...

536
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,877
MUST BE DONE.

537
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,432
YOU'LL HAVE A DRINK
WITH ME, CAPTAIN?

538
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,350
NO, THANK YOU.

539
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,436
I ASSURE YOU
IT ISN'T DRUGGED.

540
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,439
WITH OUR MIND SCANNER,
WE HAVE NO NEED

541
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,816
FOR SUCH CRUDE METHODS.

542
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,443
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

543
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,987
OH, A VERY GREAT DEAL,

544
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,030
BUT FIRST
I WANT TO TALK.

545
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,907
JUST TALK.

546
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,618
YOU THINK
I'M GOING TO SIT HERE

547
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,869
AND JUST TALK
WITH THE ENEMY?

548
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,205
YOU'LL TALK.

549
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,791
EITHER HERE, NOW,
VOLUNTARILY,

550
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,629
OR UNDER
OUR MIND SCANNER.

551
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,380
THE FACT IS, CAPTAIN,

552
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:56,049
I HAVE
A GREAT ADMIRATION
FOR YOUR STARFLEET.

553
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,926
A REMARKABLE INSTRUMENT.

554
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,554
AND I MUST CONFESS
TO A CERTAIN
ADMIRATION FOR YOU.

555
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,223
I KNOW, OF COURSE,
THAT IT WAS YOU

556
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,435
WHO DESTROYED
OUR SUPPLIES LAST NIGHT.

557
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,646
SOMETHING WAS DESTROYED?

558
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,023
NOTHING INCONSEQUENTIAL,
I HOPE.

559
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,775
HA HA HA. HARDLY.

560
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,194
THEY WERE QUITE
IMPORTANT TO US,

561
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,821
BUT THEY CAN BE
REPLACED.

562
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,199
YOU OF THE FEDERATION,

563
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,741
YOU ARE MUCH LIKE US.

564
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,410
WE'RE NOTHING LIKE YOU.

565
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,621
WE'RE A DEMOCRATIC BODY.

566
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,289
COME NOW, CAPTAIN.

567
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,000
I'M NOT REFERRING
TO MINOR IDEOLOGICAL
DIFFERENCES.

568
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,878
I MEAN THAT WE ARE
SIMILAR AS A SPECIES.

569
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:36,714
HERE WE ARE,
ON A PLANET OF SHEEP,

570
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,634
TWO TIGERS,

571
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,428
PREDATORS, HUNTERS...

572
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,305
KILLERS,

573
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,976
AND IT IS PRECISELY THAT
WHICH MAKES US GREAT.

574
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,229
AND THERE IS A UNIVERSE
TO BE TAKEN.

575
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,981
IT'S A VERY LARGE
UNIVERSE, COMMANDER,

576
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,859
FULL OF PEOPLE WHO
DON'T LIKE THE KLINGONS.

577
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,027
EXCELLENT.

578
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,155
THEN IT SHALL BE
A MATTER OF TESTING
EACH OTHER'S WILLS.

579
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,990
OF POWER.

580
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,493
SURVIVAL MUST BE EARNED,
CAPTAIN.

581
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,665
TELL ME ABOUT THE DISPERSAL
OF YOUR STARFLEET.

582
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,629
GO CLIMB A TREE.

583
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,425
I CAN GET WHAT I WANT
THROUGH OUR MIND SCANNER,

584
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,596
BUT THERE WOULD BE VERY LITTLE
OF YOUR MIND LEFT, CAPTAIN.

585
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,431
I HAVE NO DESIRE

586
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,974
TO SEE YOU BECOME
A VEGETABLE.

587
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,438
THIS FRIEND OF YOURS,
THE VULCAN.

588
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,231
HE SEEMS TO HAVE
THE ABILITY

589
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,815
TO BLOCK OUR SCANNER.

590
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,818
I THINK PERHAPS
I WILL FIND OUT WHY.

591
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,530
I WILL HAVE HIM DISSECTED.

592
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,823
YOUR FRIEND KILLED.

593
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,201
YOU A MENTAL VEGETABLE.

594
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,161
NOT A PLEASANT
PROSPECT, CAPTAIN,

595
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,663
BUT IT LIES AHEAD FOR YOU

596
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,667
UNLESS YOU TELL ME
EVERYTHING I WANT TO KNOW.

597
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,048
12 HOURS, CAPTAIN.

598
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,807
IT WILL TAKE A LOT
LONGER THAN THAT,
COMMANDER.

599
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,018
LONGER THAN THAT
I WILL NOT WAIT.

600
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,605
I RESPECT YOU,
CAPTAIN, BUT...

601
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,232
THIS IS WAR,

602
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,819
A GAME WE KLINGONS
PLAY TO WIN.

603
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,449
TAKE HIM TO THE CELL
WITH HIS FRIEND.

604
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,498
AND WATCH HIM CLOSELY.

605
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,553
IT'S NO USE, JIM.

606
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,681
THERE'S NO WAY OUT.

607
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:07,032
HOW MUCH OF THE 12 HOURS
DO WE HAVE LEFT?

608
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,325
6 HOURS, 43 MINUTES,

609
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,243
IF THE KLINGONS
ARE PUNCTUAL.

610
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,496
I THINK WE CAN COUNT
ON THEM BEING PUNCTUAL.

611
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,122
BLOWING THAT MUNITIONS DUMP
WASN'T ENOUGH.

612
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,624
WE GET OUT OF HERE,

613
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,418
WE'VE GOT TO CARRY
THE ATTACK DIRECTLY TO KOR.

614
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:22,631
THESE ORGANIANS...

615
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,424
THEY DO NOT SEEM
TO UNDERSTAND.

616
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,009
MOST PECULIAR.

617
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,927
NEVERTHELESS,
OUR ORDERS STILL STAND.

618
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,013
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE
SOME ATTEMPT

619
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,851
TO NEUTRALIZE
THE KLINGON OCCUPATION.

620
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,602
WE MAY NOT GET
THE CHANCE, CAPTAIN.

621
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:36,770
THESE WALLS
ARE VERY THICK.

622
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,399
AND THERE ARE GUARDS
EVERY FEW FEET DOWN THE HALL.

623
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,442
[BANGING]

624
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,500
OH, THERE YOU ARE,
GENTLEMEN.

625
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,001
I TRUST YOU ARE
IN GOOD HEALTH?

626
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,128
SHALL WE GO?

627
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,381
GO?

628
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,633
YES. YOUR CAPTORS PLANNED
TO DO VIOLENCE TO YOU.

629
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,134
THAT WE CANNOT PERMIT.

630
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,012
I CAME TO TAKE YOU AWAY.

631
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,014
YOU TURNED US OVER
TO THEM.

632
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,518
YOU EXPECT US
TO TRUST YOU NOW?

633
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,437
IS THERE REALLY
A CHOICE, CAPTAIN?

634
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,523
I OFFER YOU SAFETY.

635
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,115
WE CAN'T STAY HERE.

636
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,033
THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE
THEY'LL LOOK.

637
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,993
THEY WILL NOT COME HERE,
CAPTAIN. YOU MAY BELIEVE ME.

638
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,746
YOU TURN US IN,
THEN GET US OUT.

639
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,956
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW,
WAITING FOR THE KLINGONS

640
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,833
TO POST A REWARD

641
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,376
SO YOU CAN TURN US IN AGAIN
AND COLLECT IT?

642
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,211
HOW LITTLE
YOU UNDERSTAND US,
CAPTAIN.

643
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,798
NOR DO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE GUARDS
AT THE CITADEL.

644
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,633
PLEASE DO NOT
CONCERN YOURSELF
ABOUT THEM.

645
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,843
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

646
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,054
WHY, NOTHING HAPPENED
TO THEM, CAPTAIN.

647
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,640
NOTHING AT ALL.

648
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,893
COMMANDER!

649
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,561
DON'T YOU SEE I'M BUSY?

650
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,439
THE TWO FEDERATION
PRISONERS--THEY'RE GONE.

651
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,610
YOU MEAN
THEY'VE ESCAPED?

652
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,612
I SWEAR,
NO ONE WAS AT FAULT.

653
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,614
THE GUARDS, 10 OF THEM,
WERE CONSTANTLY ON DUTY

654
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,198
WATCHING THE CELL.

655
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,241
THEN WHEN THEY OPENED IT
TO GIVE THEM FOOD,

656
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,243
THEY SIMPLY WEREN'T THERE.

657
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,537
AND THERE WAS NO WAY OUT.

658
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,623
IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME...

659
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:20,666
I SWEAR!

660
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:27,005
ALL RIGHT,
LIEUTENANT.

661
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,049
IMPLEMENT SPECIAL
OCCUPATION ORDER
NUMBER FOUR.

662
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:30,717
IMMEDIATELY!

663
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,886
SIR!

664
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,643
IS THAT ALL
YOU CAN DO, SMILE?

665
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,144
YOU ARE FREE, CAPTAIN.

666
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,229
I WANT TO KNOW
HOW I'M FREE AND WHY.

667
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,272
INDEED. THERE ARE
SOME QUESTIONS

668
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,191
I WOULD LIKE
TO ASK AS WELL.

669
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,026
THIS IDIOTIC
PLACIDITY OF YOURS,

670
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,736
YOUR REFUSAL TO DO ANYTHING
TO PROTECT YOURSELVES...

671
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,613
WE HAVE ALREADY
ANSWERED THAT QUESTION.

672
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,324
TO US, VIOLENCE
IS UNTHINKABLE.

673
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,492
[KOR] ATTENTION.

674
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,244
ATTENTION ALL ORGANIANS.
ATTENTION.

675
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,664
THIS IS COMMANDER KOR.

676
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,668
THE TWO FEDERATION
PRISONERS HAVE ESCAPED,

677
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,379
OBVIOUSLY WITH OUTSIDE AID.

678
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,632
THEY WILL BE RETURNED
IMMEDIATELY.

679
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,052
SO THAT YOU WILL KNOW
WE MEAN WHAT WE SAY...

680
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,890
LISTEN.

681
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,265
[PHASER WHIRRING]

682
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,226
THOSE ARE
KLINGON PHASERS.

683
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,687
TAKE THE DOOR.
GET DOWN, GENTLEMEN.

684
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,693
IN THE COURTYARD
OF MY HEADQUARTERS...

685
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,612
200 ORGANIANS
HAVE JUST BEEN KILLED.

686
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,243
200 OF THEM.

687
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:42,831
[KOR] IN 2 HOURS,
200 MORE WILL DIE

688
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:46,418
AND 200 MORE AFTER THAT

689
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,086
UNTIL THE TWO
FEDERATION SPIES

690
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,714
ARE TURNED OVER TO US.

691
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,550
THIS IS THE ORDER OF KOR.

692
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,685
DID YOU HEAR THEM?

693
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,689
YES, OF COURSE, CAPTAIN.
BUT NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

694
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:15,530
WELL, MR. SPOCK,
IT SEEMS IT'S UP TO YOU AND ME.

695
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,156
IT WOULD
APPEAR SO, CAPTAIN.

696
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,659
THE FEDERATION HAS INVESTED
A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY
IN OUR TRAINING.

697
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,912
THEY'RE ABOUT DUE
FOR A SMALL RETURN.

698
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,580
WE HAVE 2 HOURS
WITH WHICH TO DO IT.

699
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,665
BUT ONLY 2.
MORE ORGANIANS
WILL DIE--

700
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:29,168
NO, MR. SPOCK. NO MORE
WILL DIE ON ACCOUNT OF US.

701
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,587
WHERE ARE THOSE PHASERS?

702
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,547
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

703
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,556
YOU'VE TOLD US A GREAT DEAL
ABOUT HOW YOU HATE VIOLENCE.

704
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,475
UNLESS YOU TELL ME
WHERE THOSE PHASERS ARE,

705
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,893
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE MORE VIOLENCE

706
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,561
THAN YOU KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH.

707
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,271
YOU MEAN YOU WOULD
ACTUALLY USE FORCE?

708
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,356
IT'S ENTIRELY
UP TO YOU.

709
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,400
AYELBORNE, THIS IS
OF NO MATTER.

710
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,444
PERHAPS
YOU'D BETTER LET HIM
HAVE WHAT HE WANTS.

711
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,781
VERY WELL. BUT IT WILL
DO YOU NO GOOD.

712
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,993
THEY'RE IN THAT CABINET.

713
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:08,166
GENTLEMEN, I HAVE
NO GREAT LOVE FOR YOU,

714
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,751
YOUR PLANET,

715
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,377
YOUR CULTURE.

716
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,963
DESPITE THAT,

717
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,173
MR. SPOCK AND I
ARE GOING TO GO OUT THERE

718
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,969
AND QUITE PROBABLY DIE

719
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,428
IN AN ATTEMPT TO SHOW YOU

720
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:24,808
THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS
WORTH DYING FOR.

721
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,101
THERE ARE ONLY
TWO OF YOU
AGAINST AN ARMY.

722
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,145
DON'T YOU REALIZE

723
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,981
THAT WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO
WILL BE HOPELESS?

724
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,777
COME ON, MR. SPOCK,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

725
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,911
BRAVE MEN.

726
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,164
YES,
BUT SO FOOLISH.

727
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,125
INTERESTING, HOWEVER.

728
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,918
OF COURSE
WE CANNOT ALLOW IT.

729
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,628
TO STOP THEM
IS VERY BAD.

730
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:57,174
IT IS NECESSARY.
THEY MAY HARM ONE ANOTHER.

731
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,341
TREFAYNE.

732
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,510
THEY WILL WAIT
UNTIL DARKNESS.

733
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,887
AND THEN?

734
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,347
TERRIBLE,
INCONCEIVABLE,
SAVAGE.

735
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,557
[SIGHS]

736
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,392
WE WILL WAIT.

737
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,565
[DOG BARKING]

738
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,568
MR. SPOCK, CAN WE
GET THOSE 2 GUARDS?

739
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:17,694
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
THE ODDS ARE

740
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,444
ON OUR GETTING
OUT OF HERE?

741
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,238
DIFFICULT TO BE
PRECISE, CAPTAIN.

742
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,365
I SHOULD SAY
APPROXIMATELY

743
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,452
7,824.7 TO ONE.

744
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:30,623
DIFFICULT TO BE PRECISE?
7,824 TO ONE?

745
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,418
7,824.7 TO ONE.

746
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,921
THAT'S A PRETTY CLOSE
APPROXIMATION.

747
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,964
I ENDEAVOR
TO BE ACCURATE.

748
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,174
YOU DO QUITE WELL.

749
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,467
SET YOUR PHASER ON STUN.

750
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,136
WE'RE AFTER THE TOP DOG,

751
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,846
NOT THE MEMBERS
OF THE PACK.

752
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,931
VERY GOOD.

753
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,140
BUT IF THE SITUATION
CALLS FOR IT,

754
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,391
WE KILL.
IS THAT CLEAR?

755
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,308
CLEAR, CAPTAIN.

756
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,644
I'LL TAKE THE ONE
ON THE LEFT.

757
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,856
FIRE.

758
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,957
IT HAS BEGUN.

759
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,166
VERY WELL.

760
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,209
IT WILL BE HARD.

761
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,377
PREPARE YOURSELVES.

762
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,971
NO RESULTS, COMMANDER.

763
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,139
NOTHING?

764
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,681
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND
THESE PEOPLE.

765
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,558
THEY KNOW WHAT
DEATH IS, DON'T THEY?

766
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,602
THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE
WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING.

767
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,437
BAD ENOUGH TO BE
A MILITARY GOVERNOR,

768
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,564
BUT TO GOVERN
A POPULATION OF SHEEP?

769
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:40,152
VERY WELL, LIEUTENANT.
ROUND UP 200 MORE.

770
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:41,736
YES, SIR.

771
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,197
FOOLS! WILL I HAVE TO
KILL THEM ALL?

772
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,840
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW,

773
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,676
I'LL KILL YOU
HERE AND NOW,
IS THAT CLEAR?

774
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,053
YES, THAT'S CLEAR.

775
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,764
IS KOR'S OFFICE
DOWN THERE?

776
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,933
YES.

777
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,352
WHAT ABOUT
THE HOSTAGES?

778
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,770
TALK.

779
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,938
TALK.

780
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,774
I AM TO GATHER
200 MORE.

781
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,152
TO BE KILLED?

782
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,736
YES.

783
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,780
MR. SPOCK.

784
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,617
UH!

785
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,332
WELL, WHAT ARE
THE ODDS NOW?

786
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,457
LESS THAN 7,000-TO-1,
CAPTAIN.

787
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,918
IT'S REMARKABLE
WE'VE GOTTEN THIS FAR.

788
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,753
LESS THAN 7,000-TO-1.

789
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:44,007
WELL...GETTING BETTER.
GETTING BETTER.

790
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,557
JUST STAY
WHERE YOU ARE,
COMMANDER.

791
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,562
YOU HAVE DONE WELL
TO GET THIS FAR
THROUGH MY GUARDS.

792
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,315
I BELIEVE YOU'LL FIND
THAT SEVERAL OF THEM

793
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,818
ARE NO LONGER IN PERFECT
OPERATING CONDITION.

794
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,486
SO...

795
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,364
YOU ARE HERE.

796
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,117
YOU WILL BE INTERESTED
IN KNOWING

797
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,912
THAT A FEDERATION FLEET
IS ON ITS WAY HERE

798
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,788
AT THE MOMENT.

799
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,583
OUR FLEET IS PREPARING
TO MEET THEM.

800
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,793
CHECKMATE, COMMANDER.

801
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,713
SHALL WE WAIT AND SEE
THE RESULTS

802
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,842
BEFORE YOU, UH...
KILL ME?

803
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,387
I DON'T INTEND
TO KILL YOU
UNLESS I HAVE TO.

804
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,348
AH, SENTIMENTALITY...

805
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,766
MERCY...

806
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,851
THE EMOTIONS OF PEACE...

807
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,146
YOUR WEAKNESS,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

808
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,899
THE KLINGON EMPIRE
SHALL WIN.

809
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,984
THINK OF IT,

810
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,613
AS WE SIT HERE,
IN SPACE ABOVE US,

811
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:52,367
THE DESTINY OF THE GALAXY
WILL BE DECIDED

812
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,120
FOR THE NEXT 10,000 YEARS.

813
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,956
CAN I OFFER YOU A DRINK?

814
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,542
WE CAN TOAST THE VICTORY
OF THE KLINGON FLEET.

815
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,336
YOU MAY BE PREMATURE.

816
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,754
THERE ARE
MANY POSSIBILITIES.

817
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,757
TODAY WE CONQUER.

818
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,135
THOUGH IF SOMEDAY
WE ARE DEFEATED,

819
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,971
WELL, WAR HAS
ITS FORTUNES,

820
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:16,141
GOOD AND BAD.

821
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,184
DO YOU KNOW WHY
WE ARE SO STRONG?

822
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,146
BECAUSE WE ARE A UNIT.

823
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:24,565
EACH OF US IS PART
OF THE GREATER WHOLE,

824
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,359
ALWAYS
UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

825
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,113
EVEN A COMMANDER
LIKE MYSELF.

826
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,157
ALWAYS UNDER SURVEILLANCE,
CAPTAIN.

827
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,992
IF YOU WILL NOTE.

828
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,163
COVER, SPOCK! BACK!

829
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,789
SHOOT! SHOOT!

830
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,333
OH!

831
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:42,541
AAH!

832
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:43,042
OH!

833
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,086
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

834
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,379
WHAT IS IT, SPOCK?

835
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,340
INEXPLICABLE, CAPTAIN.
EXTREME HEAT.

836
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:50,342
NOT ONLY THE WEAPONS,
BUT THE BODIES AS WELL.

837
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,593
AAH!

838
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,602
WE ARE TERRIBLY SORRY

839
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,522
TO BE FORCED TO INTERFERE,
GENTLEMEN,

840
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,566
BUT WE CANNOT PERMIT YOU
TO HARM YOURSELVES.

841
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,444
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

842
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,904
WE HAVE PUT A STOP
TO YOUR VIOLENCE.

843
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,200
YOU...ARE STOPPING THIS?
YOU?

844
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,495
ALL INSTRUMENTS
OF VIOLENCE
ON THIS PLANET

845
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,164
NOW RADIATE
A TEMPERATURE
OF 350 DEGREES.

846
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,000
THEY ARE
INOPERATIVE.

847
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,751
MY FLEET!

848
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,381
THE SAME CONDITIONS EXIST
ON BOTH STARFLEETS.

849
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:30,798
THERE WILL BE NO BATTLE.

850
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,133
RIDICULOUS!

851
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,551
I SUGGEST YOU
CONTACT THEM.

852
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,553
YOU, TOO, CAPTAIN.

853
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:39,349
YOUR SHIP IS NOW
WITHIN RANGE OF YOUR
COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE.

854
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,184
KIRK TO ENTERPRISE.
COME IN.

855
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,519
[SULU] CAPTAIN...

856
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,770
I--I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

857
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,524
WE WERE JUST CLOSING IN
ON THE KLINGON FLEET

858
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,526
WHEN EVERY CONTROL
ON OUR SHIP

859
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,027
BECAME TOO HOT
TO HANDLE.

860
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,244
OUR POWER IS GONE.

861
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,162
OUR PHASER BANKS
ARE DEAD.

862
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,788
STAND BY, SULU.

863
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,624
MY FLEET...

864
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,002
IT'S HELPLESS.

865
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,547
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

866
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:13,132
AS I STAND HERE,
I ALSO STAND UPON

867
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:16,302
THE HOME PLANET
OF THE KLINGON EMPIRE

868
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:19,764
AND THE HOME PLANET
OF YOUR FEDERATION, CAPTAIN.

869
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:22,767
I'M GOING TO PUT A STOP
TO THIS INSANE WAR.

870
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,561
YOU'RE WHAT?

871
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,644
YOU'RE TALKING NONSENSE.

872
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,355
IT IS BEING DONE.

873
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,525
YOU CAN'T JUST
STOP THE FLEET.

874
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,026
WHAT GIVES YOU
THE RIGHT?

875
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,945
YOU CAN'T INTERFERE.

876
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,031
WHAT HAPPENS IN SPACE
IS NOT YOUR BUSINESS.

877
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,533
UNLESS BOTH SIDES AGREE

878
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,535
TO AN IMMEDIATE CESSATION
OF HOSTILITIES,

879
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,538
ALL YOUR ARMED FORCES,
WHEREVER THEY MAY BE,

880
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,998
WILL BE IMMEDIATELY
IMMOBILIZED.

881
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,875
WE HAVE LEGITIMATE
GRIEVANCES AGAINST
THE KLINGONS.

882
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,045
THEY'VE INVADED
OUR TERRITORY,
KILLED OUR CITIZENS.

883
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,047
THEY'RE OPENLY
AGGRESSIVE.
THEY'VE BOASTED

884
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,673
THAT THEY'LL
TAKE OVER HALF
THE GALAXY.

885
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,468
AND WHY NOT?
WE'RE THE STRONGER!

886
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:58,136
YOU'VE TRIED
TO HEM US IN,

887
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,388
CUT OFF VITAL SUPPLIES,
STRANGLED OUR TRADE!

888
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:01,556
YOU'VE BEEN ASKING
FOR WAR!

889
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,516
YOU'RE THE ONES WHO
ISSUED THE ULTIMATUM

890
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,017
TO WITHDRAW FROM
THE DISPUTED AREAS!

891
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,644
THEY'RE NOT DISPUTED!
THEY'RE CLEARLY OURS!

892
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,647
AND NOW YOU STEP IN
WITH SOME KIND OF TRICK.

893
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,774
IT IS NO TRICK,
COMMANDER.

894
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,110
WE HAVE SIMPLY
PUT AN END TO YOUR WAR.

895
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,987
ALL YOUR MILITARY FORCES,
WHEREVER THEY ARE,

896
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:19,031
ARE NOW COMPLETELY
PARALYZED.

897
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:22,368
WE FIND INTERFERENCE
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S
AFFAIRS

898
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,496
MOST DISGUSTING,

899
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:27,499
BUT YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE
GIVEN US NO CHOICE.

900
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,375
YOU SHOULD BE
THE FIRST TO BE
ON OUR SIDE.

901
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,169
200 HOSTAGES KILLED.

902
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,921
NO ONE HAS BEEN
KILLED, CAPTAIN.

903
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:39,344
NO ONE HAS DIED HERE
IN UNCOUNTED THOUSANDS
OF YEARS.

904
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,137
YOU ARE LIARS.

905
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,388
YOU ARE MEDDLING
IN THINGS

906
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,057
THAT ARE NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

907
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,685
EVEN IF YOU
HAVE SOME...

908
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,313
POWER THAT WE DON'T
UNDERSTAND...

909
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,940
YOU HAVE
NO RIGHT TO DICTATE
TO OUR FEDERATION--

910
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,066
OR OUR EMPIRE!

911
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,692
HOW TO HANDLE

912
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,362
OUR INTERSTELLAR
RELATIONS!

913
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:58,655
WE HAVE THE RIGHT--

914
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,490
TO WAGE WAR, CAPTAIN?

915
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,241
TO KILL MILLIONS
OF INNOCENT PEOPLE?

916
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:06,371
TO DESTROY LIFE
ON A PLANETARY SCALE?

917
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:08,540
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE DEFENDING?

918
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,380
WELL, NO ONE
WANTS WAR...

919
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,716
BUT THERE ARE
PROPER CHANNELS.

920
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:24,222
PEOPLE HAVE
A RIGHT TO HANDLE
THEIR OWN AFFAIRS.

921
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,558
EVENTUALLY,
WE WILL...

922
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:29,310
OH, EVENTUALLY,
YOU WILL HAVE PEACE,

923
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,646
BUT ONLY AFTER MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED.

924
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,730
IT IS TRUE THAT
IN THE FUTURE,

925
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,274
YOU AND THE KLINGONS
WILL BECOME FAST FRIENDS.

926
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,318
YOU WILL WORK TOGETHER.

927
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,735
NEVER!

928
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,406
YOUR EMOTIONS
ARE MOST DISCORDANT.

929
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,324
WE DO NOT WISH
TO SEEM INHOSPITABLE,

930
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,785
BUT, GENTLEMEN,
YOU MUST LEAVE.

931
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,745
YES.
PLEASE LEAVE US.

932
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,708
THE MERE PRESENCE
OF BEINGS LIKE YOURSELVES

933
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,293
IS INTENSELY
PAINFUL TO US.

934
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,628
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

935
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,255
"BEINGS
LIKE YOURSELVES?"

936
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,258
MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO,
CAPTAIN...

937
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:02,719
WE WERE HUMANOID,
LIKE YOURSELVES,

938
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,762
BUT WE HAVE DEVELOPED
BEYOND THE NEED
OF PHYSICAL BODIES.

939
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,307
THAT OF US WHICH YOU SEE

940
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,851
IS MERE APPEARANCE...

941
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,687
FOR YOUR SAKE.

942
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,109
CAPTAIN, IT'S A TRICK.

943
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:21,320
WE CAN HANDLE THEM.
I HAVE AN ARMY.

944
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,991
FASCINATING.

945
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:09,160
PURE ENERGY...

946
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,078
PURE THOUGHT...

947
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,748
TOTALLY INCORPOREAL...

948
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,625
NOT LIFE
AS WE KNOW IT AT ALL.

949
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,294
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THIS PLANET?

950
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,588
THE FIELDS,
THE BUILDINGS,
THIS CITADEL?

951
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:23,591
CONVENTIONALIZATIONS,
I SHOULD SAY...

952
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,551
USELESS TO THE ORGANIANS,

953
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:27,762
CREATED SO THAT VISITORS,
SUCH AS OURSELVES,

954
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,348
COULD HAVE CONVENTIONAL
POINTS OF REFERENCE.

955
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:33,058
BUT IS ALL OF THIS
POSSIBLE?

956
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:36,270
WE HAVE SEEN IT
WITH OUR OWN EYES.

957
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,106
I SHOULD SAY THE ORGANIANS
ARE AS FAR ABOVE US

958
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,442
ON THE EVOLUTIONARY
SCALE...

959
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,903
AS WE ARE ABOVE
THE AMOEBA.

960
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,743
WELL, COMMANDER, I GUESS
THAT TAKES CARE OF THE WAR.

961
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:55,456
OBVIOUSLY, THE ORGANIANS
AREN'T GOING TO LET US FIGHT.

962
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,753
A SHAME, CAPTAIN.

963
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:05,007
IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN GLORIOUS.

964
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:33,411
YOU'VE BEEN
MOST RESTRAINED
SINCE WE LEFT ORGANIA.

965
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:36,497
I'M EMBARRASSED.

966
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,624
I WAS FURIOUS
WITH THE ORGANIANS

967
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,543
FOR STOPPING A WAR
I DIDN'T WANT.

968
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,628
WE THINK OF OURSELVES

969
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,672
AS THE MOST POWERFUL
BEINGS IN THE UNIVERSE.

970
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:48,885
IT'S UNSETTLING
TO DISCOVER
THAT WE'RE WRONG.

971
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,555
CAPTAIN...

972
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,390
IT TOOK MILLIONS OF YEARS
FOR THE ORGANIANS

973
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:57,769
TO EVOLVE
INTO WHAT THEY ARE.

974
00:48:57,894 --> 00:49:01,522
EVEN THE GODS DID NOT
SPRING INTO BEING OVERNIGHT.

975
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,149
YOU AND I HAVE NO REASON
TO BE EMBARRASSED.

976
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:07,319
WE DID, AFTER ALL,
BEAT THE ODDS.

977
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,987
OH, NO, NO, NO,
MR. SPOCK,

978
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:11,115
WE DIDN'T BEAT THE ODDS.
WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE.

979
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,158
THE ORGANIANS
RAIDED THE GAME.
