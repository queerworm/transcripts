6
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,852
ALL RIGHT, CHIEF,
BEGIN MATERIALIZATION.

7
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,451
CAPTAIN RAMART,
I'M CAPTAIN KIRK.

8
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,871
THIS IS MY NAVIGATOR
TOM NELLIS.

9
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,455
HOW DO YOU DO?

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,957
AND THIS IS OUR
YOUNG CASTAWAY CHARLIE,

11
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,375
CHARLIE EVANS,
HIS DOSSIER.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,501
MR. EVANS.

13
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,337
WE'VE HEARD
A GREAT DEAL ABOUT YOU.

14
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,547
WELCOME ABOARD.

15
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,930
Ramart:
WONDERFUL BOY,
CHARLIE.

16
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,307
IT'S BEEN A GREAT
PLEASURE HAVING HIM
ABOARD WITH US.

17
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,893
WHY, IT'S BEEN
A GREAT PLEASURE.

18
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:00,310
THE THINGS
THAT HE'S LEARNED...

19
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,645
ABSOLUTELY.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,229
TO THINK THIS BOY
SPENT PRACTICALLY
HIS WHOLE LIFE

21
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,605
ALONE
ON THAT PLANET.

22
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,566
EVERYONE KILLED,
JUST A FEW
MICROTAPES

23
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:06,483
TO LEARN FROM.

24
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,903
HOW MANY HUMANS
LIKE ME ON THIS SHIP?

25
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,156
LIKE A WHOLE CITY
IN SPACE, CHARLIE.

26
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,075
OVER 400 IN THE CREW
OF A STARSHIP,

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,827
AREN'T THERE,
CAPTAIN?

28
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,162
428, TO BE EXACT.

29
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,707
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO
FOR YOU, CAPTAIN?

30
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,083
MEDICAL SUPPLIES,
PROVISIONS?

31
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,126
HUNDREDS!

32
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,755
ALL HUMAN, LIKE ME.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,423
THAT'S EXCITING.

34
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,592
IS THAT THE RIGHT WORD?

35
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,053
THAT'S PERFECT.
IT'S THE EXACT WORD.

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,138
YOU SEE,
WE'D LIKE TO KEEP
CHARLIE WITH US.

37
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,225
BUT WITH HIS CLOSEST
LIVING RELATIVES
ON COLONY 5

38
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,770
AND YOUR VESSEL
GOING THAT WAY--

39
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,479
I'D LIKE TO SEE
YOUR SHIP NOW.

40
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,481
ALL OF IT, THE PEOPLE
AND EVERYTHING.

41
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,400
YOU KEEP INTERRUPTING,
MR. EVANS.

42
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,527
THAT'S
CONSIDERED WRONG.

43
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,031
I'M SORRY.

44
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,200
WE HAVE A LARGE SUPPLY
OF ENTERTAINMENT TAPES,
GENTLEMEN.

45
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,244
NO. WE'VE A TIGHT
SCHEDULE TO MAKE,
CAPTAIN.

46
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,246
JUST 20 OF US, WE'RE
MAKING OUT FINE.

47
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,123
THIS MUST BE
A SPACE FIRST.

48
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,792
A TRANSPORT SHIP
THAT DOESN'T NEED
ANYTHING?

49
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,251
NOTHING.

50
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,252
NOT EVEN
SARIAN BRANDY?

51
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,296
WE'RE FINE,
THANK YOU.

52
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,298
PLEASANT JOURNEY,
CAPTAIN.

53
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,507
THANK YOU.

54
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,220
YEOMAN RAND,
THIS IS CHARLES EVANS.

55
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,598
SHOW HIM
TO HIS QUARTERS

56
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,184
AND DROP HIS RECORDS OFF
AT DR. McCOY'S OFFICE,
IF YOU WILL.

57
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,144
YES, SIR.

58
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,021
COME WITH ME,
PLEASE.

59
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,993
A-ARE YOU A GIRL?

60
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,915
IS THAT A GIRL?

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,709
THAT'S A GIRL.

62
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,352
<i>SPACE--THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

63
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:09,857
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE.

64
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,525
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

65
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,112
<i>TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>STRANGE NEW WORLDS,</i>

66
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,239
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,</i>

67
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:22,703
<i>TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN</i>
<i>HAS GONE BEFORE.</i>

68
00:03:56,028 --> 00:04:00,407
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STAR DATE 1533.7.</i>

69
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,743
<i>WE HAVE TAKEN ABOARD</i>
<i>AN UNUSUAL PASSENGER</i>

70
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,204
<i>FOR TRANSPORT</i>
<i>TO COLONY ALPHA 5--</i>

71
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,415
<i>CHARLES EVANS,</i>

72
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,419
<i>THE SOLE SURVIVOR</i>
<i>OF A TRANSPORT CRASH</i>
<i>14 YEARS AGO.</i>

73
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,880
<i>THE CHILD,</i>
<i>ALONE FROM AGE 3,</i>

74
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:15,923
<i>HAS NOT ONLY SURVIVED,</i>

75
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,219
<i>BUT HAS GROWN TO INTELLIGENT,</i>
<i>HEALTHY ADOLESCENCE.</i>

76
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,307
TELL ME, UM, THE,
UH, SHIP'S SUPPLY
OF FOOD CONCENTRATES

77
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,728
COULDN'T HAVE
LASTED 14 YEARS.

78
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,147
AFTER THAT I FOUND
OTHER THINGS TO EAT,

79
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,108
JUST...GROWING AROUND.

80
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,609
AND YOU LEARNED TO TALK

81
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,319
BY JUST LISTENING
TO THE SHIP'S TAPES?

82
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,864
THE MEMORY BANKS
STILL WORKED.

83
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,992
THEY TALKED TO ME,
AND I TALKED BACK.

84
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,452
YOU'RE A 4-0.

85
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,661
A WHAT?

86
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,624
4-0, 100%, SOUND OF
WIND AND LIMB.

87
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,843
THAT--THAT
CAPTAIN...KIRK?

88
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,386
YEAH.

89
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,223
WHY DOES HE
CALL ME MR. EVANS?

90
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,641
'CAUSE THAT'S YOUR NAME.

91
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,020
HE'S NOT...

92
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,106
HE ISN'T LIKE
CAPTAIN RAMART.

93
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,065
WELL, NO.

94
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,401
CAPTAIN KIRK IS
ONE OF A KIND, CHARLIE.

95
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:24,574
DO YOU LIKE ME?

96
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,826
WHY NOT?

97
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,412
SOME...

98
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:33,333
THE OTHER SHIP,
THEY DIDN'T LIKE ME.

99
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,670
I TRIED.

100
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,464
I'M TRYING TO MAKE
PEOPLE LIKE ME.

101
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,175
I WANT THEM
TO LIKE ME.

102
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,761
MOST 17-YEAR-OLDS DO.

103
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,555
COME ON. LET'S GO.

104
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,766
I'LL SHOW YOU
TO YOUR QUARTERS.

105
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,756
HEY. I'LL PUT
THE EQUIPMENT AWAY.

106
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:22,841
SEE YOU
IN THE REC ROOM, HUH?

107
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,259
YOU GOT
A DEAL, FRIEND.

108
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,468
ALL RIGHT.

109
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,471
HELLO.

110
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,991
I BROUGHT YOU A PRESENT.

111
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,576
OH, THANK YOU.

112
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,913
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT,
BUT...BUT I HAVE TO GO.

113
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,122
I-I'M ON DUTY.

114
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,999
DO YOU LIKE THAT KIND?

115
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,625
YES, I...

116
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,923
IT'S MY FAVORITE!

117
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,674
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

118
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,177
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY
IN THE SHIP'S STORES.

119
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,221
IT'S A PRESENT.

120
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,015
I KNOW,
BUT WHERE DID...

121
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,183
GEE, I'M LATE, CHARLIE.

122
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,019
I--I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

123
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,021
CAN'T YOU STAY AND TALK
A LITTLE WHILE?

124
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,107
LOOK,
I'M OFF DUTY AT 1400.

125
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,692
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN ME

126
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,070
IN RECREATION ROOM 6,
DECK 3?

127
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,739
YOU GOT A DEAL,
FRIEND.

128
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,617
CHARLIE!

129
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,496
OH, I THOUGHT...

130
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,498
DON'T BE ANGRY.
I DIDN'T...

131
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,541
I WANTED...

132
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,002
CHARLIE, YOU--YOU...

133
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:45,882
YOU JUST DON'T GO AROUND
SLAPPING GIRLS ON THE...

134
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:52,139
IT'S O.K., BUT, UH,
JUST DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

135
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,182
DON'T BE ANGRY.

136
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,935
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL CAPTAIN KIRK

137
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,937
OR DR. McCOY
WHAT YOU DID,

138
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,064
AND THEY'LL EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU, O.K.?

139
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,024
I WILL.

140
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,193
O.K.

141
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:17,164
McCoy: BUT TELL ME, WHAT
REASON WOULD HE HAVE TO LIE

142
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,332
IF THERE ARE THASIANS?

143
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,418
THAT IS A VERY
INTRIGUING QUESTION.

144
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,295
SCANNERS SHOW
NO DISTURBANCES

145
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,255
IN THIS QUADRANT,
CAPTAIN.

146
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,465
GOOD.

147
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,468
DR. McCOY, MR. SPOCK
IS WORKING OUT--

148
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,802
EXCUSE ME, CAPTAIN.
STATUS REPORT.

149
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,429
THANK YOU.

150
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,056
HE'S WORKING OUT
A TRAINING PROGRAM
FOR CHARLIE EVANS--

151
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,809
EARTH HISTORY,
HIS OWN BACKGROUND,
THAT SORT OF THING.

152
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,520
I'D LIKE YOU
TO GIVE HIM

153
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,855
THE NECESSARY
MEDICAL ORIENTATION

154
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,441
ON THE PROBLEMS
OF, UM...UH...

155
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,985
ADOLESCENCE.

156
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,987
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER
FOR A FATHER IMAGE?

157
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,114
HE ALREADY
LOOKS UP TO YOU.

158
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,991
THE JOB IS YOURS, BONES.

159
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,575
FLATTERY WILL GET YOU
NOWHERE.

160
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,455
DOCTOR, DIDN'T THE BOY
MAKE ANY REFERENCE
AT ALL TO THASIANS?

161
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,291
DO YOU BELIEVE
THE LEGEND, MR. SPOCK,

162
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,293
THAT THASIANS STILL
EXIST ON THAT PLANET
IN SOME FORM?

163
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,170
CHARLIE'S VERY EXISTENCE
PROVES, IN FACT,
THERE MUST BE

164
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,964
SOME INTELLIGENT
FORM OF LIFE ON THASUS.

165
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,384
HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY
HAVE SURVIVED ALONE.

166
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,718
THE SHIP'S
FOOD CONCENTRATES

167
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,428
WOULD HAVE BEEN
EXHAUSTED IN A YEAR OR SO.

168
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,472
BY WHICH TIME HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN EATING
FRUITS, VEGETABLES.

169
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,974
PROBES OF THASUS INDICATE
VERY LITTLE EDIBLE LIFE.

170
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,142
PROBES HAVE
BEEN KNOWN WRONG.

171
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,394
DOCTOR, ARE YOU SPEAKING

172
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,187
SCIENTIFICALLY
OR EMOTIONALLY?

173
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,065
GENTLEMEN, THE FACT
IS THE BOY IS HERE

524
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,098
NO, I DON'T THINK SO,

525
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,809
NOT UNLESS THEY'RE EXACTLY
LIKE EARTHLINGS.

526
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,269
THE DEVELOPMENT
OF HIS FINGERS AND TOES

527
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,146
EXACTLY MATCHES
PRESENT DEVELOPMENT
OF MAN'S ON EARTH.

528
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,773
AGREED.
WELL,
WHATEVER HE IS,

529
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,318
WE HAVE SOME IDEA
OF THE POWER HE HAS.

530
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,153
I KNOW WHAT I SAW HIM DO
IN THE GYMNASIUM.

531
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,322
CONSIDERING THE EFFECT

532
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,741
A NORMAL ADOLESCENT HAS
ON A HOME, CHARLIE,
WITH THE POWER HE HAS--

533
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,868
SHORT-TEMPERED,
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND.

534
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,579
HE NEEDS, HE WANTS.
NOTHING HAPPENS
FAST ENOUGH.

535
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:13,622
THE PROBABILITY IS
HE'S RESPONSIBLE

536
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,875
FOR THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE<i> ANTARES,</i>

537
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,753
WHICH WOULD INDICATE
TOTAL DISREGARD
FOR HUMAN LIFE.

538
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,588
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT LIFE IS.

539
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,006
HE'S A BOY.

540
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,009
WELL, WHAT DO WE DO
WITH THIS BOY, JIM?

541
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,637
HOW DO WE KEEP HIM
CAGED UP?

542
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:29,555
IT GOES EVEN FURTHER,
DOCTOR.

543
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,099
WE CAN'T TAKE HIM
TO EARTH COLONY 5.

544
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,144
IMAGINE WHAT HE'D DO
IN AN OPEN, NORMAL
ENVIRONMENT.

545
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,439
TALK TO HIM,
LISTEN TO HIM.

546
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:42,609
HE'S A BOY
IN A MAN'S BODY
TRYING TO BE ADULT,

547
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,070
THE ADOLESCENT IN HIM
GETTING IN THE WAY.

548
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,572
WITH A WEAPON IN HIM,

549
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,782
WHICH COULD DESTROY
YOU OR ANYONE

550
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,868
ANYWHERE ON THIS SHIP.

551
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,582
WELL, FOR THE MOMENT
HE'S STOPPED.

552
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,000
YOU'RE AN AUTHORITY
HE RESPECTS, JIM.

553
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,377
AGREED.

554
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,255
THE STRUGGLE MUST REMAIN
BETWEEN YOU AND HIM.

555
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,716
SHOULD ANY OF US
INTERFERE...

556
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,100
YOU WANTED TO ASK ME
SOMETHING, HE SAID.

557
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,352
ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED

558
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,105
TO THE<i> ANTARES,</i> CHARLIE?

559
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,315
WHY?
ANSWER ME.

560
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,862
YES.

561
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,447
THERE WAS A WARPED
BAFFLE-PLATE

562
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,907
ON THE SHIED
OF THEIR
ENERGY PILE.

563
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,241
I MADE IT GO AWAY.

564
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,619
IT WOULD'VE
BLOWN UP ANYWAY.

565
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,665
WELL, THEY WEREN'T
NICE TO ME!

566
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,042
THEY WANTED
TO GET RID OF ME.

567
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,629
THEY DON'T NOW.

568
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,632
WHAT ABOUT US, CHARLIE?

569
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,932
I DON'T KNOW.

570
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,448
WE'RE IN THE HANDS
OF AN ADOLESCENT.

571
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,496
LIEUTENANT,
RAISE COLONY 5.

572
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,289
I WANT TO SPEAK DIRECTLY
TO THE GOVERNOR.

573
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,334
NAVIGATOR, LAY IN A COURSE
AWAY FROM COLONY 5.

574
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:22,876
BUY ME SOME TIME.

575
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,086
YES, SIR.

576
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,546
AAH!

577
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,594
SPOCK, GET THE DOCTOR
UP HERE ON THE DOUBLE.

578
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,053
HOW BAD IS IT?

579
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,055
I THINK
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SIR.

580
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,183
SIR, THERE'S NO REASON
FOR THAT PANEL

581
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,810
TO CROSS-CIRCUIT
LIKE THAT.

582
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,729
I CHECKED IT OVER MYSELF
NOT 15 MINUTES AGO.

583
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,231
CAPTAIN, I CAN'T FEED
ANY COURSE COORDINATES

584
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,692
INTO THE PANEL, SIR.

585
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:47,943
IT REJECTS
THE COURSE CHANGE.

586
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,903
HELM DOESN'T
RESPOND EITHER, SIR.

587
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,157
MR. SPOCK, YOU
GETTING READINGS
ON YOUR INSTRUMENTS?

588
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,784
YES, SIR. THERE'S A--

589
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,953
TIGER, TIGER,
BURNING BRIGHT

590
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,330
IN THE FOREST
OF THE NIGHT.

591
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,582
MR. SPOCK.

592
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:03,834
I'M TRYING TO--

593
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,293
SATURN RINGS
AROUND MY HEAD,

594
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,087
DOWN A ROAD
THAT'S MARTIAN RED.

595
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,549
YOU'RE TRYING
TO CHANGE COURSE, CAPTAIN.

596
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,468
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

597
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,847
I WANT TO GET TO COLONY 5
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

598
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,643
RELEASE THE TRANSMITTER.

599
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,688
YOU DON'T NEED ALL THAT
SUBSPACE CHATTER.

600
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,357
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

601
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,818
SPOCK CALLS ME
TO THE BRIDGE

602
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,237
AND THEN GOES INTO SOME
KIND OF POETRY.

603
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:33,697
SEE TO HER, DOCTOR.

604
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:34,406
ONCE UPON
A MIDNIGHT DREARY

605
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:35,866
WHILE I PONDERED
WEAK AND WEARY...

606
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,451
VERY NICE,
MR. EARS.

607
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,454
OH, I CAN MAKE HIM
DO ANYTHING--

608
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,458
WHIRL AROUND,
LAUGH, ANYTHING.

609
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,334
THAT'S ENOUGH, CHARLIE.

610
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,378
DON'T YOU THINK
HE'S FUNNY?

611
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,838
I THINK HE'S FUNNY.

612
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,631
LEAVE MY CREW ALONE.

613
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,856
JIM, HE'LL
SOON REACH A POINT

614
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,858
WHERE
HE WON'T BACK DOWN.

615
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,610
I KNOW.

616
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,617
CHARLIE, WHAT'S WRONG?

617
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,638
I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

618
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,442
PINK IS YOUR FAVORITE,
ISN'T IT?

619
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,991
YOU DON'T
WALK INTO A ROOM
WITHOUT KNOCKING.

620
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:03,202
DON'T EVER
LOCK YOUR DOOR
ON ME AGAIN, JANICE.

621
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,621
I LOVE YOU.

622
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,082
I'LL LOCK IT
WHEN I PLEASE.

623
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,584
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT
ANYWAY?

624
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,674
YOU.

625
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,104
I ONLY WANT
TO BE NICE TO YOU.

626
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,064
I CAN GIVE YOU ANYTHING.

627
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,149
JUST--JUST TELL ME.

628
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,483
I WANT YOU
TO GET OUT.

629
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,276
<i>BUT I ONLY WANT</i>
<i>TO BE NICE TO YOU.</i>

630
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,736
<i>GET OUT,</i> CHARLIE.
SPOCK.

631
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:40,824
<i>I CAN'T MAKE IT</i>
<i>ANY PLAINER</i>
<i>THAN THAT.</i>

632
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,409
I LOVE YOU.

633
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,370
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE WORD MEANS.

634
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,788
THEN SHOW ME.

635
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,206
NO!

636
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,879
CHARLIE.

637
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,931
WHY DID SHE DO THAT?

638
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,146
I LOVED HER,

639
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,899
BUT SHE WASN'T NICE
AT ALL.

640
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,196
WHAT YOU DID
WASN'T NICE EITHER,

641
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,157
BUT I STILL NEED YOU,
CAPTAIN.

642
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,868
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> ISN'T
QUITE LIKE THE<i> ANTARES.</i>

643
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,495
RUNNING THE<i> ANTARES</i>
WAS EASY.

644
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,291
YOU HAVE TO BE NICE.

645
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,461
ALL RIGHT?

646
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,942
MR. SPOCK?

647
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,068
MY LEGS--

648
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,652
THEY'RE BROKEN.

649
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,199
LET HIM GO, TOO,
CHARLIE.

650
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,867
WHY?

651
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,535
BECAUSE I'M
TELLING YOU TO.

652
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,289
YOU NEED ME
TO RUN THE SHIP,
AND I NEED HIM.

653
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,222
IF YOU TRY
TO HURT ME AGAIN,

654
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,557
I'LL MAKE A LOT
OF PEOPLE GO AWAY.

655
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,976
AND WHAT ABOUT
YEOMAN JANICE?

656
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,102
IS SHE DEAD?

657
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,105
GONE?
DESTROYED?

658
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,109
I WON'T TELL YOU.

659
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,412
GROWING UP
ISN'T SO MUCH.

660
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,666
I'M NOT A MAN,
AND I CAN DO ANYTHING!

661
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,752
YOU CAN'T.

662
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,469
I'LL ACTIVATE
THE FORCE FIELD MYSELF.

663
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,513
YOU CAN RETURN
TO YOUR SECTION.

664
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,515
HE HAD A MEAN LOOK.

665
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,475
I HAD TO FREEZE HIM.

666
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,227
I LIKE HAPPY LOOKS.

667
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,317
AREN'T YOU COMING IN?

668
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,222
THAT WASN'T NICE.

669
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,307
YOU'LL BE SORRY.

670
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,267
YOU WAIT.
YOU'LL SEE.

671
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,644
YOU'LL BE SORRY
YOU DID THAT.

672
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,856
YOU WILL.

673
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,838
AAH!

674
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,757
[LAUGHING]

675
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:26,966
NO.

676
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:27,842
NO LAUGHING!

AAH! AAH!

680
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,557
[MOANING]

681
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,071
CAPTAIN KIRK...

682
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,906
MY INSTRUMENTS SHOW
WE'RE RECEIVING A MESSAGE

683
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:53,993
ON SUBSPACE FREQUENCY 3,
SHIP-TO-SHIP.

684
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,579
I CAN'T HEAR IT, SIR.

685
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,538
YOU'RE CREATING
THAT MESSAGE, CHARLIE,

686
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,083
OR YOU'RE BLOCKING ONE
THAT'S COMING IN.

687
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,168
IT'S MY GAME, CAPTAIN.

688
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,544
YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT.

689
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,547
LIKE YOU SAID, THAT'S
HOW THE GAME'S PLAYED.

690
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,049
YOU CAN HAVE IT NOW.

691
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:11,386
I'VE LOCKED ON COURSE
FOR COLONY 5 AGAIN.

692
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,169
I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH.

693
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,962
I'M GOING
TO TAKE HIM ON.

694
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,006
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY SPECIAL IMMUNITY.

695
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,215
NOT ANYMORE.

696
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,716
PUSH FAR ENOUGH,

697
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,344
HE'D SEND YOU
TO OBLIVION, TOO.

698
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:53,136
MR. SPOCK?

699
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,637
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

700
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,598
WAIT A MINUTE.

701
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,392
DOES CHARLIE...

702
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,519
NOW, WAIT...

703
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,856
SPOCK, HAS HE
DONE AWAY WITH ANYBODY

704
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,441
SINCE HE TOOK OVER?

705
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,068
NOT SO FAR AS
WE KNOW.

706
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,155
THEN MAYBE HE CAN'T.

707
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,491
COULD BE
HE'S OVERREACHED HIMSELF.

708
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,244
IT'S A BIG SHIP.
HE'S TAKEN FULL CONTROL.

709
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,246
IF WE COULD
TAX HIS POWER--

710
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,832
TURN ON EVERY
DEVICE ON THE SHIP,

711
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,169
EVERY CIRCUIT,
EVERY LIGHT,
ALL OF IT--

712
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,254
AND WHILE
HE'S FIGHTING THAT,

713
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,256
IF I COULD
DISTRACT HIM,

714
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,300
MAYBE YOU COULD
TRANQUILIZE HIM,

715
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,260
KEEP HIM UNDER,

716
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,304
UNTIL WE REACH
COLONY 5.

717
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,390
RISKY, JIM.

718
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:40,392
IF WE DON'T TRY,
DOCTOR,

719
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,102
HE'LL GET RID OF US
ANYWAY.

720
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,646
THERE'S NO CHOICE,
GENTLEMEN,

721
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,399
NONE AT ALL.

722
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,194
I CAN MAKE YOU ALL
GO AWAY...

723
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,611
ANYTIME I WANT TO.

724
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,575
GET OUT OF MY CHAIR,
CHARLIE,

725
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,284
AND GET OUT
OF IT NOW.

726
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,787
I'VE GOT YOUR SHIP,
CAPTAIN.

727
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,585
MAYBE, CHARLIE,

728
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,589
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE ANY MORE.

729
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,181
I THINK YOU'VE
REACHED YOUR LIMIT

730
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,600
AND CAN'T TAKE ON
ONE MORE THING.

731
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,482
BUT YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO.

732
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,452
I COULD'VE SENT
YOU AWAY BEFORE,
BUT I DIDN'T.

733
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:43,079
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TAKE ME ON.

734
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,539
DON'T MAKE ME
DO IT NOW!

735
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,542
YOU'VE GOT MY SHIP,
AND I WANT IT BACK.

736
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:51,546
I WANT MY CREW BACK
WHOLE,

737
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,632
IF I HAVE TO BREAK
YOUR NECK TO DO IT!

738
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,885
DON'T PUSH ME.

739
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,471
AAH!

740
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:01,347
AAH! AAH!

741
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,015
AAH.

742
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,729
SORRY.

743
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,773
I'M SORRY...

744
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,317
BUT...

745
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:13,151
AAH!

746
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,612
[RECEIVER CRACKLES]

747
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,781
STOP THAT.

748
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,743
I SAID STOP IT!

749
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,871
CAPTAIN,
THE NAVIGATION CONSOLE
IS CLEAR NOW.

750
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,457
THE SHIP IS
ANSWERING THE HELM.

751
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,126
SIR, SOMETHING OFF
OUR STARBOARD BOW.

752
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,629
THE MESSAGE SAYS
THEY'RE FROM THASUS.

753
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,759
OH.

754
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,887
CAPTAIN, HOW DID I--

755
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,181
IT'S ALL RIGHT, YEOMAN.

756
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,974
SENSORS SHOW
SOMETHING'S THERE.

757
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,602
DEFLECTORS INDICATE
NO SOLID SUBSTANCE.

758
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,398
NO!

759
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,859
OH, NO, PLEASE...

760
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,278
DON'T LET THEM TAKE ME.

761
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,573
I CAN'T LIVE WITH THEM
ANYMORE!

762
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,127
YOU'RE MY FRIENDS.

763
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:19,509
YOU SAID YOU WERE
MY FRIENDS, REMEMBER?

764
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,344
WHEN I CAME ABOARD!

765
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,396
PLEASE...

766
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,774
I WANT TO GO HOME.

767
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,071
TAKE ME HOME.

768
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,580
<i>I HAVE TAKEN MY FORM</i>
<i>CENTURIES AGO,</i>

769
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:51,583
<i>SO THAT I MAY</i>
<i>COMMUNICATE WITH YOU.</i>

770
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:56,795
<i>WE DID NOT REALIZE</i>
<i>UNTIL TOO LATE</i>

771
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,881
<i>THAT THE BOY HAD GONE,</i>

772
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,342
<i>AND WE ARE SADDENED</i>
<i>THAT HIS ESCAPE</i>

773
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,720
<i>COST THE LIVES</i>
<i>OF THE FIRST SHIP.</i>

774
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,888
<i>WE COULD NOT HELP THEM,</i>

775
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,974
<i>BUT WE HAVE RETURNED</i>
<i>YOUR PEOPLE</i>

776
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,227
<i>AND YOUR SHIP TO YOU.</i>

777
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:15,189
<i>EVERYTHING IS AS IT WAS.</i>

778
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:22,113
I WON'T DO IT AGAIN.

779
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,948
PLEASE, I'LL BE GOOD.

780
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:27,368
I WON'T EVER
DO IT AGAIN.

781
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:36,168
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE<i> ANTARES.</i>

782
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,630
I'M SORRY!

783
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:40,673
WHEN I CAME ABOARD.

784
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,972
PLEASE...

785
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,642
I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.

786
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,310
HELP ME!

787
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,743
THE BOY BELONGS
WITH HIS OWN KIND.

788
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,704
<i>THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.</i>

789
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,998
WITH TRAINING,
WE CAN TEACH HIM
TO LIVE IN OUR SOCIETY.

790
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:17,293
IF HE CAN BE TAUGHT
NOT TO USE HIS POWER...

791
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:21,005
<i>WE GAVE HIM POWER</i>
<i>SO HE COULD LIVE.</i>

792
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,676
<i>HE WILL USE IT</i>
<i>ALWAYS,</i>

793
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:27,679
<i>AND HE WOULD</i>
<i>DESTROY YOU</i>
<i>AND YOUR KIND,</i>

794
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:30,515
<i>OR YOU</i>
<i>WOULD BE FORCED</i>
<i>TO DESTROY HIM</i>

795
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,349
<i>TO SAVE YOURSELVES.</i>

796
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,976
IS THERE NOTHING
YOU CAN DO?

797
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,270
<i>WE OFFER HIM LIFE,</i>

798
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,565
<i>AND WE WILL</i>

799
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,279
<i>COME, CHARLES.</i>

800
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:52,620
OH, PLEASE...

801
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,081
DON'T LET THEM TAKE ME.

802
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,545
I CAN'T EVEN TOUCH THEM!

803
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,797
JANICE...

804
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,800
THEY CAN'T FEEL.

805
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,177
NOT LIKE YOU!

806
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,306
THEY DON'T LOVE!

807
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,143
PLEASE...

808
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,689
I WANT TO STAY...

809
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:20,897
<i>STAY...</i>

810
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,149
<i>STAY...</i>

811
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:22,817

812
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:23,942

<i>STAY.</i>

815
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:44,213
Uhura:
CHARLIE'S BACK ON BOARD
THE THASIAN SHIP, SIR.

816
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,634
THEY SIGNALED
THEY'RE LEAVING.

817
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,103
IT'S ALL RIGHT, YEOMAN.

818
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:01,773
IT'S ALL OVER NOW.
