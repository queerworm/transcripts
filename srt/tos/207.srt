OF CREATURES LIKE YOURSELF.

362
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:09,889
MIND PROBING?

363
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,183
HYPNOSIS?

364
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,643
YOU LIKE
TO THINK OF YOURSELVES

365
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,187
AS COMPLEX CREATURES,

366
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,647
BUT YOU'RE FLAWED.

367
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,235
ONE GAINS
ADMITTANCE TO YOUR MINDS

368
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,819
THROUGH MANY LEVELS.

369
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,405
YOU HAVE TOO MANY
TO KEEP TRACK OF YOURSELVES.

370
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,824
THERE ARE
UNGUARDED ENTRANCES

371
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,577
TO ANY HUMAN MIND.

372
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,208
TELEPATHY.

373
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,543
NOT ENTIRELY.

374
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,628
NO, TELEPATHY
DOESN'T IMPLY CONTROL,

375
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,049
AND I ASSURE YOU THAT
I HAVE FULL CONTROL

376
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,551
OVER YOUR FRIENDS.

377
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:49,929
DON'T MOVE!

378
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,847
COVER THEM.

379
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,641
NOW, I WANT THE REST
OF OUR WEAPONS

380
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,269
AND OUR EQUIPMENT.

381
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,187
I WANT SOME ANSWERS.

382
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,189
PUT THAT WEAPON DOWN!

383
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,196
CAPTAIN, IT SEEMS
SO FOOLISH OF YOU

384
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,031
TO INSIST
ON DEMONSTRATIONS.

385
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,708
IN THE MYTHOLOGY
OF YOUR RACE,

386
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,543
THIS IS CALLED
SYMPATHETIC MAGIC.

387
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,424
JACKSON,
THE CREW MEMBER WHO
RETURNED TO THE SHIP,

388
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,466
YOU WONDERED
WHAT KILLED HIM.

389
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,468
I MADE AN IMAGE OF HIM.

390
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,846
IN THE ESSENCE
OF MY THOUGHTS,

391
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,682
THE IMAGE WAS JACKSON.

392
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,144
AND WHEN I KILLED
THE IMAGE

393
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,562
AND KNEW
THAT IT WAS DEAD,

394
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,522
HE DIED.

395
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,861
YOU CAN'T
THINK A MAN TO DEATH.

396
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,907
YOUR COMMUNICATOR.

397
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,746
NOW...

398
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,541
SIGNAL YOUR SHIP.

399
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,002
DON'T.

400
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,921
SYLVIA, DON'T.

402
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,514

405
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,856
FROM CAPTAIN KIRK.
COME IN.

406
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:24,982
CAPTAIN,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

407
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,400
WHERE ARE YOU?

408
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,734
ARE THE OTHERS
ALL RIGHT, SIR?

409
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,237
NEVER MIND ABOUT US.
WHAT'S HAPPENING UP THERE?

410
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:31,613
THE TEMPERATURE, SIR--

411
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,032
KEEPS RISING.

412
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:33,782
READING, MISTER.

413
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:39,621
IT'S OVER 60 DEGREES
IN THE PAST 30 SECONDS.

414
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,542
WE'RE BURNING UP, SIR.

415
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,057

417
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,394

419
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,730
<i>IT HAD NO EFFECT.</i>

00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,899
<i>WE'RE COOKING UP HERE.</i>

421
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,526
ALL RIGHT.

422
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,196
I'LL HANDLE IT DOWN HERE.
KIRK OUT.

423
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,873
YOU'VE WON.

424
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,084
HEE HEE!

425
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,752
YOU CAN RELAX NOW,
CAPTAIN.

426
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,586
YOUR SHIP IS SAFE.

427
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,091
TEMPERATURE IS ALMOST
BACK TO NORMAL--

428
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,093
DROPPING DOWN FAST.

429
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,555
LIEUTENANT, TRY TO RAISE
THE CAPTAIN AGAIN.

TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

431
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,100

433
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,895
<i>ENTERPRISE</i>
TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

434
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,564
ACKNOWLEDGE.

[STATIC]

436
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,445
WE'VE LOST HIM AGAIN,
MR. DeSALLE.

437
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,573
CAPTAIN, YOU'VE SEEN
SOMETHING OF OUR SCIENCE,

438
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,075
NOW--NOW TELL US
ABOUT YOURS.

439
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,536
YOU SEEM TO BE SINGING
A DIFFERENT TUNE.

440
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,704
I'D RATHER KNOW
MORE ABOUT YOURS.

441
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,622
YOU CALL IT MAGIC,
YOU CALL IT SCIENCE.

442
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,543
IT SEEMS TO BE UNRELATED
TO BOTH OF THEM.

443
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,461
WHAT WOULD YOU NAME IT?

444
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,628
I WOULDN'T ATTEMPT
AT NAMING IT.

445
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,923
YOU SEEM TO DO
WITH YOUR MIND

446
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,467
WHAT WE DO WITH TOOLS.

447
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,802
YOU ALTER MATTER--

448
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,720
MOVE IT ABOUT
BY TELEKINESIS.

449
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,973
YES, WE CAN CHANGE
THE MOLECULAR STRUCT--

450
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,434
KOROB,
YOU TALK TOO MUCH.

451
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,186
YOU KEPT SCOTT AND SULU
AS CAT'S-PAWS

452
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,481
TO LURE US DOWN HERE.

453
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,483
HOW'D YOU KNOW
WE'D COME?

454
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,109
OH, WE DIDN'T
HAVE TO KNOW.

455
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,110
THEY KNEW.

456
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,445
ENOUGH OF THIS!

457
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,323
YOU WILL TELL US
WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW.

458
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,366
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR THREATS.

459
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,577
YOU LET ME
CONTACT THE SHIP.

460
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,995
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
IT WILL BE BEFORE
A SEARCH PARTY ARRIVES?

461
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,997
SOME TIME, CAPTAIN.

462
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,832
QUITE SOME TIME.

463
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:06,477
THERE WILL
BE NO SEARCH PARTY,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

464
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,148
AN IMPENETRABLE
FORCE FIELD

465
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,274
AROUND YOUR SHIP, CAPTAIN.

466
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,734
IT WILL NOT HINDER ORBIT,

467
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,488
BUT YOUR PEOPLE
ARE PRISONERS WITHIN IT.

468
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:22,326
IT'S SOME KIND
OF A FORCE FIELD, SIR...

469
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,997
BUT NOT LIKE ANY OTHER
I'VE EVER HEARD OF BEFORE.

470
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,000
IT'S NOT COMING
FROM ANYWHERE.

471
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,252
IT'S SIMPLY
ALL AROUND US.

472
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,672
I WOULD ADVISE YOU
TO COOPERATE, CAPTAIN.

473
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,174
FORCIBLE EXTRACTION
OF THE INFORMATION
WE WISH FROM YOU

474
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,092
IS NOT COMPLICATED,

475
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,094
BUT IT IS
EXTREMELY PAINFUL,

476
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,097
AND IT HAS A CERTAIN
DRAINING EFFECT.

477
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,141
WE HAVE NOTHING
TO DISCUSS.

478
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,352
TAKE THEM TO THEIR CELL.

479
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,866
WAIT.

480
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,743
THE DOCTOR WILL STAY.

481
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,120
YOU'RE TURN WILL BE
NEXT, CAPTAIN. IT MAKES
LITTLE DIFFERENCE.

482
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,665
TAKE THEM
OUT OF HERE.

483
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,098
WAVELENGTH ANALYSIS,
MR. CHEKOV.

484
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,642
IT WILL NOT ANALYZE,
SIR.

485
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,895
ALL RIGHT...

486
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,649
BUT IT'S THERE,
AND IT'S REAL.

487
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,944
IF IT'S REAL,
IT CAN BE AFFECTED.

488
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,157
ENGINEERING,
STAND BY TO DIVERT
ALL POWER SYSTEMS

489
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,285
TO THE OUTER HULL.

490
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,161
PREPARE IMPULSE ENGINES
FOR GENERATION
OF MAXIMUM HEAT

491
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,997
DIRECTED AS ORDERED.

492
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,625
MAYBE WE CAN'T BREAK IT,

493
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,085
BUT I'LL BET YOU
CREDITS TO NAVY BEANS

494
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,921
WE CAN PUT A DENT
IN IT.

495
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,177
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

496
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,514
22 MINUTES, 17 SECONDS.

497
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,974
THANKS.

498
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,603
I WONDER WHAT
THEY'RE DOING TO DOC.

499
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,481
I'M SURE
WE'LL FIND OUT SHORTLY.

500
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,858
JIM...

501
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,071
ALL THESE THINGS
THAT WE'VE SEEN--

502
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,698
TO AN EARTHMAN
LIKE YOURSELF,

503
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,241
THEY MUST SEEM
QUITE FAMILIAR.

504
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,119
TO ME?

505
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,704
STARTLING...

506
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,871
NOT RATIONAL.

507
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:32,539
PRECISELY.

508
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:36,126
I REFER YOU TO
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY

509
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,044
OF THE RACIAL SUBCONSCIOUS.

510
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,463
THE UNIVERSAL MYTHS,
SYMBOLS--

511
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,673
GHOSTS, WITCHES.

512
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,883
AND DUNGEONS AND CASTLES
AND BLACK CATS.

513
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,471
THEY ALL BELONG
TO THE TWILIGHT WORLD
OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

514
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,933
THEY TRIED TO TAP
OUR CONSCIOUS MIND.

515
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,477
AND THEY MISSED.

516
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,270
THEY REACHED BASICALLY
ONLY THE SUBCONSCIOUS.

517
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:59,608
KOROB SEEMED QUITE PUZZLED

518
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,820
BY YOUR REACTION
TO THE ENVIRONMENT
HE'D PROVIDED.

519
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,404
HE EXPECTED ME TO REACT

520
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,573
AS THOUGH
IT WERE ALL NORMAL.

521
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:10,327
WELL, HE ADMITTED
THAT THEY WEREN'T
NATIVE TO THIS PLANET.

522
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,330
AND NOT TO HAVE A KNOWLEDGE
OF OUR SCIENTIFIC METHODS

523
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,290
IS MOST UNLIKELY
FOR ANY LIFE FORM

524
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,292
WE'VE MET IN THIS GALAXY.

525
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,712
THEY REFER TO US
AS CREATURES,

526
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,714
AS THOUGH WE WERE
SOME SPECIES

527
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,632
THAT THEY WERE
UNFAMILIAR WITH.

528
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,634
WELL, IF WE'RE
CREATURES...

529
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,556
I WONDER WHAT
THEY'RE REALLY LIKE.

530
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:34,934
EVIDENTLY SOMETHING
TOTALLY ALIEN

531
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,062
IN ALL RESPECTS.

532
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,605
AGREED.
TOTALLY ALIEN.

533
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,567
AND I DON'T LIKE
HOSTILE STRANGERS

534
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:43,569
SHOWING SUCH
AN ACUTE INTEREST

535
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,278
IN OUR GALAXY,
OUR WORLD, SPOCK.

536
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,865
NOT AT ALL
LIKE FRIENDLY VISITORS.

537
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:52,202
WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO STOP THEM COLD.

538
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,540
BUT AT THE MOMENT...

539
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,961
I, TOO, AM AT A LOSS
AT THIS TIME

540
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,005
TO SUGGEST
A COURSE OF ACTION.

541
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,841
[DOOR OPENS]

542
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,521
OH, BONES.

543
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:38,624
DOC.

544
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,591
YOU FORGET WHAT WE
WERE SENT HERE FOR.

545
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,093
I FORGET NOTHING.
I'M NOT A PUPPET,
KOROB, LIKE YOU.

546
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,137
YOU'RE A TRAITOR.

547
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,972
YOU ARE A FOOL.

548
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,481
WE HAVE
NOTHING LIKE THIS,

549
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,149
AND I LIKE IT.

550
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,692
TO TOUCH, TO FEEL,

551
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:08,487
TO UNDERSTAND
THE IDEA OF LUXURY--

552
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,322
I LIKE IT.

553
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,704
AND I DON'T INTEND
TO LEAVE IT.

554
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,081
WE HAVE A DUTY
TO THE OLD ONES.

555
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,125
WHAT DO THEY KNOW
OF SENSATIONS?

556
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,376
THIS IS A NEW WORLD.

557
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,210
YOU'RE CRUEL.

558
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,713
YOU TORTURE
OUR SPECIMENS.

559
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,132
AND THAT, TOO,
IS A NEW SENSATION.

560
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:29,967
I FIND IT STIMULATING.

561
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,718
YOU'RE WRONG!

562
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,095
YOU'RE DISCARDING
EVERYTHING WE LIVE BY.

563
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,139
I LIVE BY
MY OWN DECISIONS.

564
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,141
YOU'RE A WEAK FOOL, KOROB.

565
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,018
I HAVE THE POWER.

566
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,020
BUT YOU'RE AFRAID
TO USE IT.

567
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,981
DON'T THREATEN ME.

568
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,733
I CAN SQUASH YOU,

569
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:50,195
AND THAT WOULD BE
AN INTERESTING SENSATION, YES.

570
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,573
I FIND I LIKE
THESE NEW SENSATIONS.

571
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,368
DON'T TRY TO PUSH ME.

572
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,625
OH, CAPTAIN.

573
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,879
IT'S TIME FOR OUR TALK.

574
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,716
KOROB, LEAVE US ALONE,

575
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,968
AND TAKE THESE MEN
WITH YOU.

576
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,267
THIS IS NOT ENDED,
SYLVIA.

577
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:25,022
BUT IT MAY END SOON,
OLD MAN.

578
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,196
WHAT NOW?

579
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:38,159
YOU WAVE YOUR MAGIC WAND
AND DESTROY MY MIND, TOO?

580
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,079
THERE'S NO REAL DAMAGE
TO THE MIND, CAPTAIN,

581
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,582
SIMPLY A DRAIN
OF KNOWLEDGE AND WILL.

582
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,250
YOU DON'T
CALL THAT DAMAGE?

583
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,335
WHY SHOULD I?

584
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,129
YOU'D KNOW...

585
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,090
IF YOU HAD COMPASSION.

586
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,968
A WOMAN
SHOULD HAVE COMPASSION,

587
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,637
BUT I FORGET
YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN.

588
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,097
BUT YOU'RE MISTAKEN,
CAPTAIN.

589
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:03,727
I AM A WOMAN NOW.

590
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,229
I COME FROM A WORLD
WITHOUT SENSATION,

591
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,857
AS YOU AND I NOW KNOW IT.

592
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,984
IT EXCITES ME.

593
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,070
I WANT MORE.

594
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,906
YOU SEEM TO NEED US.
WHY?

595
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,700
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
KNOWLEDGE WHICH I LACK,

596
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,911
BUT WERE OUR ABILITIES
PUT TOGETHER...

597
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,084
TELL ME ABOUT POWER,
CAPTAIN.

598
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,047
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

599
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,107
WHAT ABOUT KOROB?

600
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,817
HE IS A FOOL.

601
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,902
I'LL DO WITHOUT HIM,

602
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,529
BUT YOU--

603
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,240
WHY DO I
FIND YOU DIFFERENT?

604
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,329
WHY WOULD IT
BE SO DIFFICULT
TO DISPOSE OF YOU?

605
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,921
WHY DON'T YOU SIMPLY
PROBE MY MIND

606
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,464
AND GET WHAT YOU WANT?

607
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,510
NO, NOT THAT,
NOT FOR YOU.

608
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,512
WHAT I WANT IS...

609
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,017
IS A JOINING--

610
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,519
MY MIND TO YOURS
WILLINGLY.

611
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,730
THINK OF THE SECRETS
YOU WOULD LEARN.

612
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,108
THINK OF THE POWER
THAT WOULD BE YOURS.

613
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,028
ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE,
I CAN GIVE YOU.

614
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:38,279
YOU'RE VERY PERSUASIVE.

615
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,956
WHAT HAPPENS
IF I GO ALONG?

616
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,960
THEN EVERYTHING
WOULD BE OURS TOGETHER.

617
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,131
I'VE NEVER
CONCEIVED OF THE IDEA
OF TOGETHERNESS BEFORE.

618
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,132
IT EXCITES ME.

619
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,010
YOU EXCITE ME.
WHY?

620
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,972
FOR THE SAME REASONS
YOU EXCITE ME.

621
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,349
YOU'RE
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

622
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,194
YOU FIND ME BEAUTIFUL?

623
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,573
BUT I CAN BE
MANY WOMEN.

624
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,378
YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE...

625
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:42,385
OR DO YOU PREFER ME
AS I WAS?

626
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,313
YOU HAVE A KNACK
FOR GIVING ME
DIFFICULT CHOICES.

627
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,124
YOU HAVE
NOTHING LIKE THAT
WHERE YOU COME FROM?

628
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,332
NOTHING.

629
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,461
YOUR PEOPLE...

630
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:17,712
WHEN THEY COME HERE...

631
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,215
THEY'RE LIKE...

632
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,509
LIKE FEATHERS IN THE WIND
WITHOUT THE TRANSMUTER.

633
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,137
TRANSMUTER?

634
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:26,512
THE SOURCE.

635
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,056
YOU WILL LEARN.

636
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,642
I WILL TEACH YOU LATER--
LATER.

637
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,187
THEN IT'S A DEVICE.
YOU DO USE TOOLS.

638
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,981
OH, IT GIVES ONLY FORM.

639
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,649
YOU'RE TEACHING ME
SUBSTANCE.

640
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,151
YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED YOUR MIND?

641
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,277
YOU WON'T RETURN HOME?

642
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,654

IS HERE WITH YOU--

A BILLION WORLDS
OF SENSATION
TO PICK AND CHOOSE.

644
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,547
YOU ARE USING ME.

645
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,094
YOU HOLD ME IN YOUR ARMS,

646
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,513
AND THERE IS NO FIRE
IN YOUR MIND.

647
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,515
YOU'RE TRYING
TO DECEIVE ME!

648
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,518
IT'S HERE
LIKE WORDS ON A PAGE.

649
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:14,769
YOU ARE USING ME.

650
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,397
AND WHY NOT?
YOU'VE BEEN USING
ME AND MY CREW.

[DOOR OPENS]

652
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,659
YOU WILL BE SWEPT AWAY--

654
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:36,291
YOUR WORLDS!

655
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,639
I DON'T SEE ANY CHANGE.

00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,641
IT'S THERE,

657
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,145
IT WAS
THAT ELECTRICAL FIELD
WE SET UP, MR. DeSALLE,

658
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,021
THAT DENT YOU WANTED.

659
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,148
IT'S NOT MUCH,

660
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,692
BUT IT IS A START.

661
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,069
KEEP IT UP,

IT'S STARTING
TO WEAKEN.

00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,131
I'VE RELEASED
THE MODEL OF YOUR SHIP

FROM THE CRYSTAL,

668
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,969
ALTHOUGH THEY WOULD HAVE
FREED THEMSELVES SOON.

669
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:34,140
IT'S DIFFICULT TO CONTROL
SO MANY THINGS

670
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,808
IN SO LITTLE TIME.

671
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,936
HERE.

672
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,523
YOU MUST GO
BEFORE SHE FINDS
THE WEAPON IS MISSING.

673
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,276
I'M NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT MY MEN.

674
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:46,152
THEY'RE NOT
YOUR MEN ANYMORE.

675
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,696
THEY BELONG TO SYLVIA.

676
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,116
I CAN NO LONGER
CONTROL THEM...

677
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,742
OR HER.

678
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,703

THE STRAIN OF ADOPTING
TO YOUR FORM,

FOR SENSATION

WAS NOT NECESSARY.

00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,593
WE COULD HAVE ENTERED
YOUR GALAXY IN PEACE.

00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,053
YOU CAME IN A SHIP?

685
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,512
WE USED THE TRANSMUTER.

686
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,390
TRANSMUTER, YES.
SHE MENTIONED THAT.

687
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,393
THERE'S NO TIME
TO EXPLAIN NOW.

688
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,104
SHE MEANS
TO DESTROY US ALL.

689
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,481
THERE MIGHT STILL
BE A CHANCE.

690
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,941

WHY A CAT?

697
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,357
RACIAL MEMORIES.

698
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:08,234
THE CAT IS
THE MOST RUTHLESS,

699
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,861
MOST TERRIFYING
OF ANIMALS,

700
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,155
AS FAR BACK AS
THE SABER-TOOTHED TIGER.

701
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,908
I THINK
I CAN STOP HER.

702
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,203
YOU BETTER LET US.

703
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,787
IT'S OUT OF ENERGY.

704
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:20,705
SHE MUST HAVE DRAINED IT.

705
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,791
WE COULD HAVE JUMPED
SCOTT AND SULU
AT ANY TIME.

706
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,543
WE DIDN'T KNOW.

NO WAY OUT.

00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,554

00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:10,588
GET READY.

717
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,551
[GRRR]

718
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,726
NO!

719
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:24,727
[GRRR]

720
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,895
GET BACK.

721
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,356
GET BACK.

722
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,316
GET BACK!
GET BACK!

723
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:31,901
KOROB,
THAT DOOR WON'T LAST.

724
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,652
GET BACK!

725
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,905
GET BACK!
GET BACK!

726
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:42,787
GO.

727
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:43,788
GO!

728
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,499
[GRRR]

729
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:51,003
[GRRR]

730
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,100
QUICKLY, CAPTAIN.

731
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,894
KOROB SEEMED TO THINK
THIS WAS IMPORTANT.

732
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,229
SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A TRANSMUTER.

733
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,403
CAPTAIN,
A BIT MORE ALACRITY,
IF YOU PLEASE.

734
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,494
CAPTAIN.

735
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:41,679
DOC.

736
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,556
AHA!

737
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,208
JIM!

738
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,178
WELL, AT LEAST
WE FOUND THEM.

739
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,888
FORTUITOUS, CAPTAIN.

740
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:26,765
AND NOW THAT WE HAVE
THEM ALL TOGETHER?

741
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,519
[GRRR]

742
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,483
[GRRR]

743
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,241
MOST UNPLEASANT
SITUATION, CAPTAIN.

744
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,951
IF ONLY YOUR PHASER
HAD SOME POWER.

745
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,329
[GRRR]

746
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,915
MAYBE WE DO.

747
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,044
[GRRR]

748
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,444
SYLVIA...

749
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:20,861
I HAVE THE TRANSMUTER.

750
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,030
IT'S MINE NOW.

751
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,616
[GRRR]

752
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,244
[GRRR]

753
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:34,125
YOU'RE VERY CLEVER,
CAPTAIN--

754
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,210
MORE SO THAN I'D IMAGINED.

755
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,920
CLEVER...

756
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,838
RESOURCEFUL...

757
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,340
AND HANDSOME.

758
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:44,552
DON'T LET HER
TOUCH THE WAND, CAPTAIN.

759
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,728
JIM!

760
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,690
DON'T YOU GET TIRED
OF THESE GAMES?

761
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:00,067
I'VE NEVER PLAYED GAMES.
GIVE IT TO ME.

762
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,944
I WASN'T SURE BEFORE,
BUT I AM NOW.

763
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,029
THIS IS THE SOURCE
OF YOUR POWER, ISN'T IT?
THE TRANSMUTER?

764
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,491
NO, NOT THE SOURCE.
IT'S MERELY AN AMPLIFIER.

765
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:07,533
A DIRECT TO THE MIND
IS THE SOURCE.

766
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:09,452
MINE IS SIMPLE,
BUT YOURS HAS THE KEY,

767
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,036
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO USE IT.

768
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,580
I CATCH ON QUICKLY.

769
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:15,082
IT IS NOT TOO LATE,
CAPTAIN JAMES KIRK.

770
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,084
COME WITH ME.
I WILL TEACH YOU.
YOU WILL TEACH ME.

771
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,919
WHY? BECAUSE YOUR
PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING
OF YOUR OWN?

772
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,505
IS THAT WHY YOU NEED US?

773
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,256
WE NEED YOUR DREAMS,
YOUR AMBITION.

774
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,300
WITH THEM I CAN BUILD.
GIVE ME THE TRANSMUTER.

775
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,926
NO.

776
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,052
YOU FOOL.

777
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,472
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GIVING UP?

778
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,683
EVERYTHING
THAT YOUR SPECIES
FINDS DESIRABLE.

779
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:33,267
LOOK AT ME.

780
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,187
I AM A WOMAN.
I AM ALL WOMEN.

781
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,189
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE,

782
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,191
BUT YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN.

783
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,400
YOU'VE TORTURED MY MEN

784
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,860
AND TAKEN THEIR MINDS
FROM THEM.

785
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,904
YOU ASK FOR LOVE
AND RETURN PAIN INSTEAD.

786
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,365
KOROB WAS WRONG.

787
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,907
I DIDN'T DESTROY
ALL YOUR WEAPONS.

788
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,285
GIVE ME THE TRANSMUTER.

789
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,078
GIVE IT TO ME!

790
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,141
WHAT HAPPENED, JIM?

791
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,184
THAT'LL TAKE
SOME EXPLAINING, BONES.

792
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,686
EVERYTHING'S VANISHED.

793
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,270
NOT EVERYTHING.

794
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,618
KOROB AND SYLVIA
AS THEY REALLY ARE.

795
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:34,328
THEIR FORMS
WERE AN ILLUSION,

796
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,789
JUST LIKE THE CASTLE
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

797
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,791
ONLY THE POWER PACK
GAVE THEM REALITY.

798
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:39,584
FASCINATING.

799
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:43,254
A LIFE FORM
TOTALLY ALIEN
TO OUR GALAXY.

800
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:46,591
IF WE COULD PRESERVE
AND STUDY THIS...

801
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,346
TOO LATE.

802
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:58,143
ALL OF THIS,
JUST AN ILLUSION.

803
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,354
NO ILLUSION.

804
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,774
JACKSON IS DEAD.

805
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,527
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>
COME IN.

806
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,279
Uhura:
<i>STANDING BY, CAPTAIN.</i>

807
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:09,530
FIVE TO BEAM UP.
