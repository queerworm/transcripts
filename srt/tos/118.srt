179
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,831
IT'S PRETTY CLOSE
FOR, UH, ONE OF THESE
LITTLE JEWELS, CAPTAIN.

180
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,584
IT'LL BE A LOT CLOSER
TO THEM. STAND CLEAR.

182

Sulu: CAPTAIN,
THE ALIEN'S WITHDRAWING.

184
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,115
SHE'S AT EXTREME RANGE,

185
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,408
BUT OUR SENSORS INDICATE

186
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,992
SHE JUST ACTIVATED
HER TRANSPORTERS.

187
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,578
LOCK ON TO THE ALIEN,
MR. SULU.

188
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,870
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE HER.

189
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,163
AYE, AYE, SIR.

190
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,290
OUR SCREENS ARE DOWN.

191
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,250
WE CAN BEAM
YOU UP NOW, SIR.

192
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,044
I WANT A SEARCH PARTY
OF 30 MEDICAL PERSONNEL

193
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,004
BEAMED DOWN IMMEDIATELY
TO SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS.

194
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,882

CAPTAIN'S LOG,

197
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,225
WE HAVE BEAMED BACK
TO THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

198
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,060
AND IMMEDIATELY SET OUT
IN PURSUIT

199
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,270
OF THE ALIEN VESSEL.

200
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,148
IT APPEARS TO BE HEADED
TOWARDS A LARGELY UNEXPLORED

201
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,732
SECTION OF THE GALAXY.

202
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,692
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

203
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,862
SCANNERS
REPORTED A SHIP
APPROACHING.

204
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,072
WE GET THEM
NOW AND THEN.

205
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,532
THEY'RE ALL
WELCOME TO USE
OUR FACILITIES.

206
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,741
YOU KNOW THAT.

207
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,409
YES, I KNOW.

208
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,704
THEY CAME IN
SPACE NORMAL SPEED,

209
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,999
USING OUR REGULAR
APPROACH ROUTE,
BUT...

210
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,502
THEY KNOCKED OUT
OUR PHASER BATTERIES

211
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,003
WITH THEIR
FIRST SALVO.

212
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,754
FROM THEN ON,
WE WERE HELPLESS.

213
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,047
WE WEREN'T
EXPECTING ANYTHING!

214
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,715
WHY SHOULD WE?!

215
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,010
WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING ANYONE
WOULD WANT!

216
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,053
EASY. EASY.

217
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,388
THEY POURED IT ON,

218
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,600
LIKE--LIKE PHASERS,
ONLY WORSE,

219
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,768
WHATEVER THEY
WERE USING.

220
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,771
I TR-TRIED
TO SIGNAL THEM.

221
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,774
WE CALLED UP,
TRIED TO SURRENDER.

222
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,527
WE HAD WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.

223
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,529
I TOLD THEM THAT.
I BEGGED THEM.

224
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:36,363
THEY WOULDN'T
LISTEN.

225
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,282
THEY DIDN'T LET UP
FOR A MOMENT.

226
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:46,289
LIEUTENANT, THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
RECEIVED 2 MESSAGES,

227
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,790
OSTENSIBLY
FROM CESTUS 3--

228
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,126
ONE FOR THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
TO GO THERE

229
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,629
AND THE OTHER FOR MYSELF
AND MY TACTICAL CREW

230
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,297
TO BEAM DOWN
TO THE SURFACE.

231
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,218
THEY HIT US A FULL DAY
BEFORE YOU GOT THERE,
CAPTAIN.

232
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:03,515
NO MESSAGES
CAME FROM US, CAPTAIN.

233
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,308
WHY DID THEY DO IT?

234
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,061
WHY?!

235
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,313
WHY DID THEY DO IT?

236
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,028
THERE HAS TO BE
A REASON.

237
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,947
THERE HAS
TO BE A REASON!

238
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,366
IT WAS A TRAP--

239
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,536
GETTING<i> THE ENTERPRISE</i>
TO COME TO CESTUS 3,

240
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,079
GETTING US AND OUR WHOLE CREW
TO COME ASHORE.

241
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,288
VERY CLEVER.

242
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,540
AS TO THE REASON...

243
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:29,916
THE REASON
IS CRYSTAL CLEAR.

244
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,792
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
IS THE ONLY PROTECTION

245
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,169
IN THIS SECTION
OF THE FEDERATION.

246
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,379
DESTROY THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

247
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,422
AND EVERYTHING
IS WIDE OPEN.

248
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,756
YOU ALLUDE TO INVASION,

249
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,133
YET POSITIVE PROOF HAS--

250
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,387
I HAVE ALL THE PROOF
I NEED ON CESTUS 3.

251
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,514
NOT NECESSARILY, SIR.
SEVERAL POSSIBLE
EXPLANATIONS COME--

252
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,141
HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN
A MASSACRE LIKE THAT?

253
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,560
NO, MR. SPOCK,

254
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,770
THE THREAT IS CLEAR
AND IMMEDIATE.

255
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,066

256
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,198
VERY WELL, THEN.

257
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,243
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

258
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,828
YOU MUST MAKE CERTAIN
THAT THE ALIEN VESSEL

259
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,497
NEVER REACHES
ITS HOME BASE.

260
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,331
I INTEND TO.

261

IN THE DARK

262
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,792
AS TO OUR STRENGTH,

263
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,795

MOVE AGAINST US.

00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,995

308
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,374
I MEAN TO CATCH THEM.

309
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,668
WE'LL EITHER
CATCH THEM, OR WE'LL
BLOW UP, CAPTAIN.

310
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,004
THEY MAY BE FASTER
THAN WE ARE.

311
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,923

TO PROVE IT.

YOU MEAN TO DESTROY

314
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,020
OF COURSE.

315
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,314
I THOUGHT PERHAPS
THE HOT PURSUIT ALONE

316
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,232
MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT.

317
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,776

UNNECESSARY.

THE DESTRUCTION

320
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,700
WILL NOT HELP
THAT COLONY, JIM.

321
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,035
IF THE ALIENS
GO UNPUNISHED,

322
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,161
THEY'LL BE BACK,

WE ARE THE METRONS.

00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,496

INTO OUR SPACE
ON A MISSION OF VIOLENCE.

AND HAVE LEARNED

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,590
THAT YOUR VIOLENT TENDENCIES
ARE INHERENT.

00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,175
SO BE IT.

454
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,469
WE WILL CONTROL THEM.

00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,232
THIS IS KIRK.

459
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,151
WE HAVE PREPARED

00:21:58,276 --> 00:21:59,735
WITH A SUITABLE
ATMOSPHERE.

461
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,946
YOU WILL BE TAKEN THERE,

462
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,116
AS WILL THE CAPTAIN
OF THE GORN SHIP WHICH
YOU HAVE BEEN PURSUING.

463
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,619
THERE YOU WILL SETTLE
YOUR DISPUTE.

464
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,037

465
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,538

WITH A RECORDING-TRANSLATING
DEVICE

467
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,085
IN HOPES THAT A CHRONICLE
OF THIS CONTEST

468
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,172
WILL SERVE TO DISSUADE
OTHERS OF YOUR KIND

469
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:20,256
FROM ENTERING OUR SYSTEM,

470
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,091
BUT YOU WILL
NOT BE PERMITTED

471
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,843
TO COMMUNICATE
WITH YOUR SHIP.

472
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:27,554
YOU WILL EACH
BE TOTALLY ALONE.

YOU CAN INTERFERE--

IT IS YOU
WHO ARE INTERFERING.

00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,603
WE ARE SIMPLY
PUTTING A STOP TO IT.

476
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,688
THE PLACE WE HAVE
PREPARED FOR YOU

477
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,398
CONTAINS SUFFICIENT ELEMENTS
FOR EITHER OF YOU

478
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,109
TO CONSTRUCT WEAPONS
LETHAL ENOUGH

479
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,944
TO DESTROY THE OTHER,

480
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,697
WHICH SEEMS
TO BE YOUR INTENTION.

481
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,282
THE WINNER OF THE CONTEST
WILL BE PERMITTED

482
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,326
TO GO HIS WAY UNHARMED.

483
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,204

ALONG WITH HIS SHIP,

484
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:54,915

IN THE INTERESTS OF PEACE.

485
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,501
THE CONTEST WILL BE ONE
OF INGENUITY AGAINST INGENUITY,

00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,837
BRUTE STRENGTH
AGAINST BRUTE STRENGTH.

487
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,715

WILL BE FINAL.

489
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,384
THERE WILL BE
NO DISCUSSION.

00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,109
NO, I WON'T KILL HIM!

708
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,195
DO YOU HEAR?

709
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,407
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET
YOUR ENTERTAINMENT
SOMEPLACE ELSE!

710
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,967
YOU'RE A METRON?

711
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,429
DOES MY APPEARANCE
SURPRISE YOU, CAPTAIN?

712
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,308
YOU SEEM
MORE LIKE A BOY.

713
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:13,521
I AM APPROXIMATELY
1,500 OF YOUR
EARTH-YEARS OLD.

714
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,732
YOU SURPRISE<i> ME,</i>
CAPTAIN.

715
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,567
HOW?

716
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,694
BY SPARING
YOUR HELPLESS ENEMY

717
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,987
WHO SURELY WOULD
HAVE DESTROYED YOU,

718
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:25,700
YOU DEMONSTRATED
THE ADVANCED
TRAIT OF MERCY,

719
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,952
SOMETHING
WE HARDLY EXPECTED.

720
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,455
WE FEEL THERE MAY BE
HOPE FOR YOUR KIND.

721
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,374
THEREFORE YOU WILL
NOT BE DESTROYED.

722
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,917
IT WOULD NOT BE...

723
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,669
CIVILIZED.

724
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,508
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE GORN?

725
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:45,511
I SENT HIM
BACK TO HIS SHIP.

726
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:49,056
IF YOU LIKE,
I SHALL DESTROY HIM
FOR YOU.

727
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:52,393
NO. THAT WON'T
BE NECESSARY.

728
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,731
WE CAN TALK...

729
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,483
MAYBE...

730
00:46:58,608 --> 00:46:59,108
REACH AN AGREEMENT.

731
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,403
VERY GOOD, CAPTAIN.

732
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,489
THERE<i> IS</i> HOPE FOR YOU.

733
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:07,992
PERHAPS IN
SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS,

734
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,035
YOUR PEOPLE AND MINE

735
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,498
SHALL MEET
TO REACH AN AGREEMENT.

736
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:16,501
YOU ARE
STILL HALF SAVAGE,

737
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,127
BUT THERE IS HOPE.

738
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,837
WE WILL CONTACT YOU
WHEN WE ARE READY.

739
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,346
Uhura: CAPTAIN!

740
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:29,722
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

741
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:31,557
I DON'T KNOW.

742
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,353
I DON'T KNOW.

743
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,773
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
BACK TO YOUR POSTS.

744
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,066
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

745
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,828
CAPTAIN.

746
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,745
MR. SULU.

747
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,122
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, BUT...

748
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,500
THERE'S SIRIUS
OVER THERE WHEN IT
SHOULD BE HERE.

749
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,794
AND CANOPUS...

750
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,086
AND ARCANIS.

751
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,422
WE'RE--

752
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,633
ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE'RE
CLEAR ACROSS THE GALAXY,

753
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:09,094
500 PARSECS FROM WHERE
WE ARE--I MEAN, WERE.

754
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,012
I MEAN...

755
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,098
DON'T TRY AND
FIGURE IT OUT, MR. SULU.

756
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,601
JUST PLOT A COURSE
FOR US BACK TO CESTUS 3.

757
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,603
AYE, AYE, SIR.

758
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,156
AFTER YOU TOUCHED OFF
YOUR PRIMITIVE CANNON, CAPTAIN,

759
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,117
WE LOST THE PICTURE
THE METRON WAS SENDING US.

760
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,578
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED
DOWN THERE?

761
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:36,080
MOST OF IT.

762
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,457
I WOULD BE
INTERESTED IN KNOWING
WHAT FINALLY HAPPENED.

763
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:43,254
WE'RE A MOST PROMISING
SPECIES, MR. SPOCK...

764
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,214
AS PREDATORS GO.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

765
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,924
I FREQUENTLY
HAD MY DOUBTS.

766
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,594
I DON'T.

767
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:51,804
NOT ANYMORE.

768
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:55,516
AND MAYBE IN
A THOUSAND YEARS OR SO,

769
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,101
WE'LL BE ABLE
TO PROVE IT.

770
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,478
NEVER MIND, MR. SPOCK.

771
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:02,273
IT DOESN'T MAKE
MUCH SENSE TO ME EITHER.

772
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:05,276
TAKE US BACK
TO WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE, MR. SULU.

773
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:06,611
WARP FACTOR 1.

774
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:08,237
WARP FACTOR 1.

775
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,989
A THOUSAND YEARS,
CAPTAIN?

776
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:14,034
WELL, THAT GIVES US
A<i> LITTLE</i> TIME.
