1
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,802
PASSING
OUTER PLANET ZEON.

2
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,095
WE WANT
THE INNER ONE, EKOS.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,931
PLOT A STANDARD ORBIT,
MR. CHEKOV, AND TAKE US IN.

4
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,474
AYE, SIR.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,267
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
TRY TO RAISE JOHN GILL

6
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,644
ON STARFLEET
COMMUNICATIONS.

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:19,603
AYE, AYE,
SIR.

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,104
STARFLEET'S
BEEN TRYING
FOR SIX MONTHS.

9
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,230
IF HE'S STILL
ALIVE,

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,650
ISN'T IT UNLIKELY
THAT HE'D RECEIVE
US NOW?

11
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:25,985
I DON'T KNOW, BONES.

12
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,488
WE'RE HERE TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S HAPPENED
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW.

13
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,031
I NEVER MET JOHN GILL,

14
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,492
BUT I STUDIED
EARTH HISTORY FROM
THE TEXT HE PREPARED.

15
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,035
I KNEW HIM VERY WELL.

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,996
HE WAS MY INSTRUCTOR
AT THE ACADEMY.

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,915
WHAT IMPRESSED ME MOST
WAS HIS TREATMENT
OF EARTH HISTORY

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,251
AS CAUSES AND MOTIVATIONS
RATHER THAN DATES
AND EVENTS.

19
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,837
[UHURA]
CAPTAIN,

20
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,755
NO RESPONSE ON ANY
STARFLEET CHANNEL.

21
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,299
SPACECRAFT APPROACHING
FROM INNER PLANET.

22
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,344
FROM EKOS?

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,305
YES, BUT IT MUST BE
A ZEON SHIP.

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,767
THE ZEONS DO HAVE
A CRUDE INTERPLANETARY
CAPABILITY.

25
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,060
REACTION POWERED,

26
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,688
A SMALL ROCKET.

27
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,025
IT IS ON
AN INTERCEPT COURSE.

28
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,572
THAT WOULD MEAN
IT HAS SOPHISTICATED
DETECTION DEVICES

29
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,949
WHICH NEITHER ZEON
NOR EKOS SHOULD HAVE.

30
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:14,950
HAVE YOU RAISED ANYONE,
LIEUTENANT?

31
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,410
NOTHING, SIR.

32
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,328
CAPTAIN, IT IS
AN UNMANNED PROBE

33
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,999
WHICH SEEMS TO BE
CARRYING A WARHEAD.

34
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,294
STAND BY PHASERS.

35
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,297
PHASERS READY.

36
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,174
RANGE, MR. CHEKOV?

37
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,718
2,000 KILOMETERS.

38
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,553
CLOSING FAST.

39
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,097
FIRE.

40
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,522
FASCINATING.

41
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,106
A THERMONUCLEAR
WARHEAD.

42
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,736
THAT'S GENERATIONS AHEAD
OF WHERE THESE PEOPLE
SHOULD BE TECHNICALLY.

43
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,071
HOW DID THEY
MANAGE THAT?

44
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,031
MAYBE THEY HAD HELP.

45
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,797
<i>SPACE--THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

46
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,640
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE,

47
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,894
<i>IT'S FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>
<i>TO EXPLORE STRANGE</i>
<i>NEW WORLDS,</i>

48
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,856
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,</i>

49
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:31,485
<i>TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN</i>
<i>HAS GONE BEFORE.</i>

50
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,192
GO TO MAXIMUM ORBIT.

51
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,029
TAKE US OUT OF RANGE
OF THEIR DETECTION
DEVICES.

52
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,613
MOST INTERESTING.

53
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,324
WE WERE ATTACKED
BY A THERMONUCLEAR
MISSILE

54
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,536
FROM A PLANET
WHICH SHOULD HAVE
NO SUCH WEAPON.

55
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,163
ORBIT COMPUTED
AND LOCKED IN,
SIR.

56
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,372
EXECUTE.

57
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,083
CAPTAIN, NO RESPONSE
FROM JOHN GILL
ON ANY CHANNEL.

58
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,002
HE MUST BE DEAD.

59
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,128
AND WHAT'S
GOING ON

60
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,212
DOWN THERE
ON EKOS?

61
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,589
ACCORDING
TO OUR RECORDS,

62
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,425
THE EKOSIANS
ARE A PRIMITIVE,
WARLIKE PEOPLE

63
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,969
IN A STATE OF ANARCHY.

64
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,972
THE OTHER PLANET, ZEON,
HAS A RELATIVELY
HIGH TECHNOLOGY,

65
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,807
AND ITS PEOPLE
ARE PEACEFUL.

66
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,393
WE'VE RUN INTO A FAR MORE
SERIOUS PROBLEM

67
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,436
THAN THE DISAPPEARANCE
OF JOHN GILL.

68
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,480
SPOCK, YOU AND I
WILL BEAM DOWN.

69
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,440
BONES, ONE PRECAUTION--

70
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,276
PREPARE A SUBCUTANEOUS
TRANSPONDER

71
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,697
IN THE EVENT WE CAN'T
USE OUR COMMUNICATORS.

72
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,782
INSERT THE TRANSPONDER,
DOCTOR.

73
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,835
MAKE ONE LOW PASS
TO COMMUNICATION RANGE
IN THREE HOURS.

74
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,546
IF WE FAIL TO MAKE CONTACT
AT THE APPOINTED TIME,

75
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,465
TAKE OUR COORDINATES
FROM THE TRANSPONDER
AND BEAM US ABOARD,

76
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,135
NO MATTER WHAT
OUR CONDITION MAY BE.

77
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,221
AYE, SIR.
WHATEVER
YOUR CONDITION.

78
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,222
YOU READY?

79
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,431
READY, CAPTAIN.

80
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,644
ENERGIZE.

81
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,532
THE EKOSIANS
ARE HUMANOID,

82
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,911
SO THERE IS APT
TO BE A SIMILARITY
IN ARCHITECTURE.

83
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,746
INTERESTING.

84
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,797
UGH...

85
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:57,798
HIDE!

86
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,216
THEY'RE RIGHT
BEHIND ME.

87
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,841
HIDE!

88
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,551
HIDE!

89
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,557
ZEON PIG.

90
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,187
ON YOUR FEET, PIG.

91
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,487
CAPTAIN,

92
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,363
THE NONINTERFERENCE
DIRECTIVE.

93
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,574
HOLD HANDS ABOVE
YOUR HEAD, ZEON.

94
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,243
HIGHER.

95
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,786
KEEP YOUR HANDS
IN THE AIR

96
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,621
SO YOU DON'T TOUCH
ANYTHING EKOSIAN.

97
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,499
YOU SWINE HAVE
DEFILED US FOR
THE LAST TIME.

98
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,417
BUT THAT'S NOW ENDED.
MOVE!

99
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,592
UNBELIEVABLE.

100
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,803
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THOSE UNIFORMS?

101
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,387
MID-20th CENTURY EARTH.

102
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,183
THE NATION STATE
CALLED NAZI GERMANY.

103
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,558
<i>ATTENTION...</i>

104
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,644
<i>ATTENTION...</i>

105
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,729
<i>ATTENTION...</i>

106
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,024
<i>AN ANNOUNCEMENT</i>
<i>FROM</i> FUHRER<i> HEADQUARTERS.</i>

107

<i>TODAY, THE</i> FUHRER
<i>HAS ORDERED OUR</i>
<i>GLORIOUS CAPITAL</i>

108
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,112
<i>TO BE MADE ZEON-FREE.</i>

109

<i>WHO'VE BEEN POISONING</i>
<i>OUR PLANET.</i>

111
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,368
HOW COULD THIS
HAVE HAPPENED?

112
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,163
THE CHANCES
OF ANOTHER PLANET

113
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,748
DEVELOPING A CULTURE
LIKE NAZI GERMANY,

114
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,168
USING THE FORMS,
THE SYMBOLS,
THE UNIFORMS

115
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,129
OF 20th CENTURY EARTH
ARE SO FANTASTICALLY SLIM.

116
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,797
VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE, CAPTAIN,

117
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,885
YET THE EVIDENCE
IS QUITE CLEAR.

118
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,930

THE<i> FUHRER?</i>

134
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,013
FASCINATING.

135
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,891
YOU, ZEONS!

136
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,610
WHAT KIND OF MONSTERS
ARE THE ZEONS SENDING
AGAINST US?

137
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,320
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE'S NOT ONE OF US.

138
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:25,904
WHAT DO YOU MEAN--US?

139
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,530
LOOK AT HIM.

140
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,743
SPOCK,
TAKE HIS UNIFORM.

141
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,037
YOU PROPOSE WE PASS
OURSELVES OFF AS
NAZIS, CAPTAIN?

142
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,455
IF JOHN GILL IS
THE<i> FUHRER,</i>

143
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,374
IT WOULD SEEM
THE LOGICAL APPROACH.

144
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,626
THAT'S VERY WELL
TAKEN, CAPTAIN.

145
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,852
THAT HELMET COVERS
A MULTITUDE OF SINS.

146
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,063
LIEUTENANT,

147
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,191
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

148
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,694
A ZEON?

149
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,780
YES. OBVIOUSLY HE'S
NOT ONE OF US.

150
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,157
I CAPTURED HIM.

151
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,408
IS THAT NOT THE
CORRECT PROCEDURE

152
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,368
WITH ENEMIES
OF THE FATHERLAND?

153
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,995
WITH ALL ZEON PIGS,
LIEUTENANT.

154
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,912
TAKE CHARGE OF HIM.

155
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,497
WITH PLEASURE.

156
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,541
TODAY WE HAVE A SURPRISE
PLANNED FOR YOU, ZEON.

157
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:25,839
YOUR UNIFORM,
CAPTAIN.

158
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,591
YES. IT'S A SHAME YOURS
ISN'T AS ATTRACTIVE AS MINE.

159
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,717
GESTAPO, I BELIEVE.

160
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,969
QUITE CORRECT.

161
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,848
YOU SHOULD MAKE
A VERY CONVINCING
NAZI.

162
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,484
LIEUTENANT!

163
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,653
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
HOW TO SALUTE?

164
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,739
YOUR PAPERS.

165
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,992
YOUR ORDERS,
LIEUTENANT.

166
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,244
HE WANTS TO SEE YOUR
ORDERS IN THE JACKET.

167
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,079
THE LIEUTENANT'S
A LITTLE DAZED.

168
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,415
HE CAPTURED
SEVERAL ZEONS
SINGLE-HANDED.

169
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,293
ONE OF THE PIGS STRUCK HIM
BEFORE HE DROPPED.

170
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:07,672
I PROMISE YOU
THAT PIG WILL NEVER
GET UP AGAIN.

171
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,590
GOOD WORK,
LIEUTENANT.

172
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,176
HAIL THE<i> FUHRER.</i>

173
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,178
HAIL TO THE<i> FUHRER.</i>

174
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,223
THIS IS A DAY
TO REMEMBER, MAJOR.

175
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,682
LIEUTENANT?

176
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,934
BETTER SEE A DOCTOR.

177
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,977
YOU DON'T LOOK WELL.

178
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,812
YOUR COLOR.

179
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,565
YES. I SHALL
TEND TO IT, MAJOR.

180
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,067
LIEUTENANT!

181
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,074
YOUR HELMET.
REMOVE IT.

182
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,910
WE HAVE URGENT BUSINESS
WITH THE<i> FUHRER.</i>

183
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,661
LIEUTENANT,

184
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,497
REMOVE YOUR HELMET.

185
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,781
ENOUGH.

186
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,664
DO YOU WISH
TO SPEAK NOW?

187
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,549
TELL ME YOUR ORDERS!

188
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,426
YOU WERE SENT HERE
TO KILL OUR<i> FUHRER.</i>
CONFESS!

189
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,885
DO YOU WANT SOME
MORE PERSUASION?

190
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,597
YOU'RE MAKING THIS
A RATHER ONE-SIDED
CONVERSATION, MAJOR.

191
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,849
DO NOT JOKE WITH ME,
ZEON PIG.

192
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,146
WHO IS THIS ALIEN?

193
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,147
THINGS MIGHT
GO EASIER FOR YOU

194
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,316
IF YOU TELL ME
ABOUT HIM.

195
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,817
LET ME SPEAK TO
YOUR<i> FUHRER.</i>

196
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,319
I'LL TELL HIM EVERYTHING
HE WANTS TO KNOW.

197
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,279
YOU'LL BE GLAD TO
TALK TO ME

198
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,573
BEFORE I'M
THROUGH WITH YOU.

199
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,991
MAJOR.

200
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,951
AH, CHAIRMAN ENEG.

201
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,039
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
I AM HONORED.

202
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,000
I'VE BEEN
INTERROGATING
THESE TWO SPIES,

203
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:07,917
CAPTURED IN--

204
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,211
I'VE HAD A FULL REPORT.

205
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,806
YOU ARE NOT
FROM ZEON.

206
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,682
OBVIOUSLY.

207
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,520
WHERE DO YOU
COME FROM?

208
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,897
I'LL EXPLAIN WHEN
I SEE THE<i> FUHRER.</i>

209
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,358
WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS
WITH THE<i> FUHRER?</i>

210
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,109
I'LL DISCUSS THAT
ONLY WITH HIM.

211
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,277
PIG!

212
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,820
YOU ARE SPEAKING
TO THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE PARTY.

213
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,822
THAT'S ENOUGH,
MAJOR.

214
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,788
WHAT WERE
THE WEAPONS
FOUND ON YOU?

215
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,290
WHAT DESIGN?

216
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:55,006
OUR FAMOUS S.S. LABORATORIES
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISCOVER
HOW THE WEAPONS WORK.

217
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,134
EXCELLENCY, GIVE ME
A FEW MINUTES WITH THEM.

218
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,260
I PROMISE YOU, I'LL--

219
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,263
YOU HAD
A FEW MINUTES,
WITHOUT RESULT.

220
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,224
THE TROUBLE
WITH YOU S.S.

221
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,767
IS THAT YOU
DON'T REALIZE

222
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,564
THAT PUNISHMENT
BECOMES INEFFECTIVE
AFTER A CERTAIN POINT.

223
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,566
MEN BECOME...

224
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,025
INSENSITIVE.

225
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,652
YES, EXCELLENCY.

226
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,154
LOCK THEM UP.

227
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,574
LET THEIR PAIN
ARGUE WITH THEM.

228
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,949
THEN I WILL
QUESTION THEM.

229
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,284
EXCELLENCY,
THE STANDING ORDER

230
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,744
IS TO INTERROGATE
AND EXECUTE.

231
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,581
THE INTERROGATION
IS FINISHED,
THEREFORE--

232
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:28,747
FINISHED?

233
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,167
WHAT HAVE YOU
LEARNED?

234
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,751
HOLD THEM
FOR AN HOUR.

235
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,045
EXCELLENCY,
THE ORDER--

236
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,381
THAT IS
<i>MY</i> ORDER, MAJOR.

237
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,593
I SUGGEST YOU DO NOT
DISOBEY IT.

238
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,428
YES, EXCELLENCY.

239
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,973
ALL RIGHT, PIGS...

240
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,101
I SHALL KEEP MY EYE
ON THE CLOCK.

241
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,395
WHEN THE HOUR IS UP,

242
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,648
YOU WILL DIE
MOST UNPLEASANTLY,
I PROMISE YOU!

243
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,776
LOCK THEM UP.

244
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,161
JOHN GILL
WAS THE KINDEST...

245
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,163
GENTLEST MAN
I EVER KNEW.

246
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,790
FOR HIM
TO BE A NAZI--

247
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,791
AH--

248
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,502
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

249
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,638
WHY DID THEY TAKE YOU?

250
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,223
YOU'RE NOT A ZEON.

251
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,808
HE CERTAINLY IS NOT ONE.

252
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,852
WHY DO THE NAZIS
TREAT YOU AS ENEMIES?

253
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,606
WHY DO THE NAZIS
HATE ZEONS?

254
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,275
WHY?

255
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,569
BECAUSE WITHOUT US
TO HATE,

256
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,781
THERE WOULD BE NOTHING
TO HOLD THEM TOGETHER.

257
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,200
SO THE PARTY HAS BUILT US
INTO A THREAT,

258
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,369
A DISEASE TO BE WIPED OUT.

259
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:52,081
IS ZEON
A THREAT TO THEM?

260
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,001
WHERE<i> DID</i> YOU COME FROM?

261
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,796
OUR WARLIKE PERIOD ENDED
DOZENS OF GENERATIONS AGO.

262
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,172
WE CAME HERE,

263
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,342
WE THOUGHT WE WERE
CIVILIZING THE EKOSIANS.

264
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,178
IT WOULD SEEM
THE ASSUMPTION
WAS PREMATURE.

265
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,514
WERE THEY LIKE THIS
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE?

266
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,557
WARLIKE, YES,
BUT NOT VICIOUS.

267
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,185
THAT STARTED
WHEN THE NAZI
MOVEMENT BEGAN.

268
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,894
IT WAS ONLY
A FEW YEARS AGO.

269
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,940
THAT WOULD COINCIDE
WITH THE TIME OF
JOHN GILL'S ARRIVAL.

270
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,026
WHEN THEY'VE
DESTROYED US HERE,

271
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,653
THEY WILL ATTACK
OUR PLANET.

272
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,155
THEY'LL USE
THE TECHNOLOGY
WE GAVE THEM.

273
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,659
THE DANGER IS
THAT TAKING LIFE IS SO
REPUGNANT TO OUR PEOPLE,

274
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,953
I'M AFRAID WE'LL GO DOWN
WITHOUT A STRUGGLE.

275
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,582
BUT AFTER WHAT I SAW
IN THE STREET TODAY,

276
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,626
I THINK I COULD KILL.

277
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,592
DO YOU KNOW THE PLAN
OF THIS BUILDING?

278
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,968
WHY?

279
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,304
IF WE CAN GET TO
THE S.S. WEAPONS LABORATORY--

280
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,764
GET OUR WEAPONS BACK--

281
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,725
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
STOP THE SLAUGHTER
OF THE ZEONS.

282
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,519
WHY SHOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN SAVING ZEONS?

283
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,189
WE MUST GET
OUR COMMUNICATORS,
CONTACT THE SHIP.

284
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,566
I POINT OUT,
CAPTAIN,

285
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,569
THE FLAW IN THE PLAN
IS THIS LOCKED DOOR

286
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:03,862
AND THE GUARD
BEYOND IT.

287
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,657
TO THE LOGICAL MIND,
THE OUTLOOK IS
SOMEWHAT GLOOMY.

288
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,539
THE TRANSPONDERS.

289
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:15,623
YES.

290
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,380
AND A WAY TO SHED
SOME LIGHT ON
THE GLOOM, MR. SPOCK.

291
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,798
OF COURSE.

292
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,719
THE RUBINDIUM CRYSTALS
IN THE TRANSPONDERS.

293
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,580
ARE--ARE YOU TRYING
TO KILL YOURSELVES?

294
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,388
I KNOW IT'S THERE.

295
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,807
McCOY PUT IT IN.

296
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,850
THERE.

297
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,687
DO YOU HAVE THE FIGURES
COMPUTED, MR. SPOCK?

298
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,231
YES. IT WILL BE
NECESSARY TO HOLD
THE CRYSTALS

299
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,525
RIGIDLY AT
A SPECIFIC DISTANCE,

300
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:30,323
WHICH I BELIEVE
SHOULD BE 27.2
MILLIMETERS.

301
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:35,829
27.2 MILLIMETERS
WOULD BE
APPROXIMATELY...

302
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,371
THERE.

303
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,499
THAT IS, OF COURSE,
A CRUDE ESTIMATION.

304
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,625
OF COURSE.

305
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,167
WHAT IS IT YOU'RE
MAKING THERE,

306
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,502
SOME KIND OF RADIO?

307
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,170
NO, NOT A RADIO.

308
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,631
THE POWER FROM THIS
LIGHT IS VERY LOW.

309
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,507
YES. TO REACH THAT
LIGHT,

310
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,301
I SHALL REQUIRE SOME
SORT OF PLATFORM.

311
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,763
I WOULD BE HONORED,
MR. SPOCK.

312
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:58,142
NOW, THE RUBINDIUM
CRYSTALS SHOULD FIND
ENOUGH POWER HERE

313
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:02,772
TO ACHIEVE
THE NECESSARY
STIMULUS.

314
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,775
AS I RECALL
FROM THE HISTORY
OF PHYSICS,

315
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,236
THE ANCIENT LASERS
WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE

316
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,155
THE NECESSARY
EXCITATION,

317
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,783
EVEN USING CRUDE
NATURAL CRYSTALS.

318
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:14,826
OHH--MR. SPOCK,

319
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,954
THE GUARD DID
A VERY PROFESSIONAL
JOB ON MY BACK.

320
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,121
I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D HURRY.

321
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,708
YES, OF COURSE,
CAPTAIN.

322
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,292
YOU REALIZE THAT
THE AIM

323
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,919
WILL, OF COURSE,
BE VERY CRUDE.

324
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:25,712
I...

325
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:30,216
DON'T CARE IF YOU
HIT THE BROAD SIDE
OF A BARN.

326
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,300
JUST HURRY, PLEASE.

327
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:36,014
CAPTAIN,
WHY SHOULD I AIM
AT SUCH A STRUCTURE?

328
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,598
NEVER MIND, SPOCK.

329
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,559
JUST GET ON
WITH THE JOB.

330
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,705
OH, MY GOODNESS.

331
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,590
BEAUTIFUL.

332
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,966
OH, SPOCK...

333
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,259
SPOCK...

334
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,220
BEAUTIFUL.

335
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,137
OVER THERE.

336
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,598
I'LL CREATE A COMMOTION.

337
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:19,515
HELP!

338
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,141
HELP! I'LL TALK!

339
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,309
I'LL TALK!

340
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,896
I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE!
I'LL TALK!

341
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:25,772
GUARD!

342
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,607
GUARD, I'LL TALK!

343
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:28,524
[DOOR OPENS]

344
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,484
GUARD, I'LL TALK.

345
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,778
I'LL TALK.

346
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,195
THE PAIN...

347
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,410
TAKE ME WITH YOU.

348
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,662
GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO FIGHT THEM.

349
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,329
CAPTAIN, I
REMIND YOU,

350
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,248
WE DID NOT
INTEND TO FIGHT.

351
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:48,294
TAKE ME WITH YOU,
OR YOU'LL NEVER FIND
THE LABORATORY.

352
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,714
TAKE HIM WITH US,
MR. SPOCK.

353
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,340
HE'S GOT A POINT.

354
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,634
HE'S OUR GUIDE.

355
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,230
WHICH IS
THE LABORATORY DOOR?

356
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,316
THE END OF THE HALL.

357
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,663
[DOOR CLOSES]

358
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,668
ALL RIGHT,
ZEON PIGS, MOVE.

359
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,797
OHH.

360
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:33,756
ZEON PIG.

361
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,341
THEY DO
NOTHING RIGHT.

362
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,300
DON'T WORRY.

363
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,802
THEY'RE
ON THEIR WAY

364
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,386
TO THE LABORATORY

365
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,638
FOR EXPERIMENTAL
WORK.

366
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,640
THEY'LL PAY.
MOVE!

367
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,525
MOVE! MOVE!

368
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,278
COVER THE DOOR.

369
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,790
HERE THEY ARE--

370
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,167
THE COMMUNICATORS...
DISASSEMBLED.

371
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:09,834
CAN YOU
GET ONE TO WORK?

372
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,335
POSSIBLY.

373
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,546
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?

374
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,588
THE PHASERS?

375
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,256
I DO NOT SEE THEM.

376
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,551
WHERE DO YOU COME FROM?

377
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,857
THE ALIEN PISTOLS

378
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,110
HAVE BEEN SENT
TO GESTAPO COMMAND
HEADQUARTERS.

379
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,363
WELL, THAT TAKES CARE
OF THE PHASERS.

380
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,209
YOU ZEONS,
FOR PEACEFUL PEOPLE,

381
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,585
ARE PRETTY THOROUGH.

382
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,586
YES.

383
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,171
WITH THIS UNIFORM,

384
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,174
WE CAN STEAL A CAR,
GET OUT OF THE CAPITAL.

385
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,759
WE CAME TO GET
JOHN GILL.

386
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,385
CAPTAIN,
WITHOUT PHASERS,

387
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,097
AND UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO
COMMUNICATE WITH THE SHIP,

388
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,058
IT IS ILLOGICAL TO ASSUME
THAT WE CAN HOLD OUT

389
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,351
AGAINST THE ENTIRE
MILITARY FORCE
OF THIS PLANET.

390
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,311
ALL RIGHT, MR. SPOCK.
YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT.

391
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,900
GET INTO THE UNIFORM
AND HIDE THOSE EARS AGAIN.

392
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,111
HUNTING'S GOOD.

393
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,029
WE'VE CAUGHT SO MANY ZEONS,

394
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,531
WE'VE GOT TO
DUMP THEM OUTSIDE.

395
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,900
WHO'S WITH YOU?

396
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,485
DAVOD, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

397
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,988
THEY HELPED ME ESCAPE
FROM THE PRISON.

398
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,114
I OWE THEM MY LIFE.

399
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,365
ISAK, WHAT IS ALL THIS?

400
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,492
ABROM...

401
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,828
ABROM, THANK GOD
YOU'RE WELL.

402
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,831
THIS IS MY BROTHER.

403
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,168
THEY WERE IN THE PRISON,
BEATEN AS I WAS, ABROM.

404
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,418
WHY WERE YOU
IN THEIR PRISON?

405
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,004
I WAS TRYING TO SEE
THE<i> FUHRER.</i>

406
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,214
THE<i> FUHRER?</i>

407
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,882
IF I CAN SEE HIM,

408
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:26,095
THERE MAY BE A WAY OF
STOPPING THIS INSANITY.

409
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,973
ABROM,
I OWE THEM MY LIFE.

410
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,560
ISAK...

411
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,606
ULETTA...

412
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,357
IS DEAD...

413
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,610
SHOT DOWN
IN THE STREETS.

414
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,833
SH-SHE WOULD'VE
BEEN MY WIFE.

415
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:03,381
SHE LIVED FOR FIVE HOURS...

416
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,634
WHILE THEY
WALKED PAST HER...

417
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,846
AND SPAT ON HER.

418
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,894
OUR OWN PEOPLE WERE
UNABLE TO HELP HER.

419
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,230
NOW YOU ASK ME TO...

420
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,481
HELP STRANGERS.

421
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,284
IF WE ADOPT
THE WAYS OF THE NAZIS,

422
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,661
WE'RE AS BAD AS THE NAZIS.

423
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,333
CAPTAIN...

424
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,336
I SUGGEST
THE MOST PROFITABLE
USE OF OUR TIME

425
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,631
WOULD BE
TO REASSEMBLE
OUR COMMUNICATORS.

426
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,385
MAY I WORK
UNDISTURBED
SOMEWHERE?

427
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,724
THIS WAY.

428
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,814
BY USING PARTS
FROM BOTH,

429
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,275
I'VE COMPLETED
ONE COMMUNICATOR.

430
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,945
I DO NOT KNOW
IF THE CIRCUITS
ARE CORRECT, CAPTAIN.

431
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,363
THERE'S NO WAY
TO TEST IT,

432
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,031
EXCEPT IN ACTUAL USE.

433
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,993
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
WON'T BE WITHIN RANGE
FOR ANOTHER HOUR.

434
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,707
OVER THERE
AGAINST THE WALL,
ALL OF YOU.

435
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,210
THE GIRL ON THE
VIEWSCREEN, CAPTAIN--
THE ONE RECEIVING A MEDAL.

436
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:21,835
DARAS.

437
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,461
QUIET.

438
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,257
HANDS IN THE AIR,
ZEON SWINE.

439
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,591
SO YOU'RE THE THREE

440
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,052
WHO ESCAPED FROM
THE CHANCELLERY
DETENTION CENTER.

441
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,306
WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN? SPEAK.
IT'S THE LAST CHANCE
YOU'LL GET.

442
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,682
I MUST SEE
THE<i> FUHRER.</i>

443
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,767
IT'S URGENT.

444
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,769
URGENT?

445
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,396
I'LL BET IT IS.

446
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,649
I ALONE AM
RESPONSIBLE FOR
WHAT HAPPENS HERE.

447
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,778
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO
TO RESPONSIBLE ZEONS?

448
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,704
NOW WE FINISH THE JOB.

449
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,303
STOP, NAZIS.

450
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,138
AFTER YOU'VE KILLED
THE LAST OF US OFF,

451
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,931
WHAT DO YOU DO,
TURN THE GUNS AGAINST
YOURSELVES?

452
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,557
NO, DON'T SHOOT.

453
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,725
DON'T SHOOT,
PLEASE.

454
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,936
NO, WAIT.

455
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,606
NO MORE.

456
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,899
YOU'VE PROVED
THEY'RE
ON OUR SIDE.

457
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,401
NOW, PLEASE FORGIVE US,

458
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,362
BUT WE HAD TO BE
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN.

459
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,864
YES. IF WE
HAD TAKEN YOU
INTO OUR CONFIDENCE,

460
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,324
WE COULD'VE BETRAYED
ALL OUR PEOPLE,

461
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,409
<i>IF</i> YOU HAD
BEEN NAZI SPIES.

462
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,576
ALL RIGHT, LEAVE US.

463
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,329
THE GESTAPO METHODS
ARE FRIGHTENINGLY EFFICIENT.

464
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,580
WE MUST BE VERY,
VERY CAREFUL

465
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,833
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE HERE.

466
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,794
WE OF THE UNDERGROUND
DON'T KNOW
WHO OUR LEADERS ARE.

467
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,880
THAT WAY, IF WE BREAK
UNDER PRESSURE,

468
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,090
WE CAN ONLY BETRAY
A HANDFUL OF OUR PEOPLE.

469
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,175
THIS YOUNG LADY'S
A NAZI,

470
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,177
A HERO
OF THE FATHERLAND.

471
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,678
WE SAW HER
BEING DECORATED.

472
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,930
I'M AN EKOSIAN,
FIGHTING
THE TERRIBLE THING

473
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,807
THAT'S HAPPENED
TO MY PEOPLE.

474
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,727
THE DECORATION
WAS FOR BETRAYING

475
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,063
MY OWN FATHER
TO THE PARTY.

476
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,942
IT WAS
MY FATHER'S IDEA.

477
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,903
SEE, HE USED TO BE
VERY CLOSE
TO THE<i> FUHRER.</i>

478
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,071
THEN HE
SAW THE CHANGES

479
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,697
AND WHERE
THEY WERE LEADING.

480
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,658
HE TURNED
AGAINST THE PARTY.

481
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,161
THEY IMPRISONED HIM.
MELAKON SENTENCED
HIM TO DEATH.

482
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,578
MELAKON?

483
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,457
THE DEPUTY<i> FUHRER.</i>
HE'S TAKEN OVER.

484
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,708
MY FATHER
DENOUNCED ME,

485
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,960
MAKING IT APPEAR
AS THOUGH I HAD
BETRAYED HIM.

486
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,339
HE GAVE ME A WEAPON
TO CONTINUE
THE FIGHT WITH.

487
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,716
BUT HOW COULD THIS
HAVE SEEMED RIGHT
TO JOHN GILL?

488
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,552
WHO?

489
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,969
JOHN GILL,
YOUR<i> FUHRER.</i>

490
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,595
HE'S ONE OF OUR PEOPLE.

491
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,181
AND WHAT IS
YOUR PEOPLE?

492
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,771
I'M CAPTAIN JAMES KIRK

493
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:46,439
OF THE UNITED
SPACESHIP<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

494
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,690
THIS IS MY FIRST OFFICER
MR. SPOCK.

495
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,776
JOHN GILL,
YOUR<i> FUHRER,</i>

496
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,319
WAS SENT HERE
BY THE FEDERATION

497
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,654
AS A CULTURAL OBSERVER.

498
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:02,162
YOU MEAN THAT
THE<i> FUHRER</i> IS AN ALIEN?

499
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,621
[SPOCK]
THAT IS CORRECT.

500
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,838
I GREW UP TO ADMIRE HIM,

501
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,301
LATER TO HATE AND DESPISE
EVERYTHING HE STANDS FOR.

502
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,927
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT

503
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,804
HE WAS ONE OF US.

504
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,223
NOW TO HEAR HE'S AN ALIEN
SENT HERE TO DESTROY US--

505
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,809
THAT WAS NOT
HIS MISSION, EVER.

506
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,229
HE WAS SENT HERE
TO OBSERVE,
NOT TO INTERFERE.

507
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,646
SOMETHING
WENT WRONG,

508
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,232
AND THAT'S
WHY WE'RE HERE,

509
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,025
TO FIND OUT
AND TO CORRECT.

510
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,860
WE MUST SEE HIM.

511
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:34,945
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

512
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,573
EVEN IF THIS
WERE ANOTHER TIME,

513
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,949
IT STILL WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE.

514
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,909
HE SEES NO ONE--
NO ONE BUT MELAKON,

515
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,953
AND HE'S UNDER
MAXIMUM SECURITY.

516
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,746
MAXIMUM SECURITY?

517
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,541
IS HE SO AFRAID?

518
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,750
THERE ARE MANY OF US--

519
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,961
EKOSIANS AND
YOUNGER ZEONS--

520
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,171
WHO WOULD GLADLY
RISK OUR LIVES
TO KILL HIM.

521
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,299
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE.

522
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,342
THIS GOES AGAINST

526

FROM THE CHANCELLERY.

527
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,646
ALL THE TOP PARTY OFFICIALS
WILL BE THERE.

528
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,938
WILL YOU BE THERE?

529
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,857
OF COURSE,

530
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:15,361
AS A SYMBOL
OF THE PROPER ATTITUDE
TOWARD THE FATHERLAND.

531
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,363
AS AN HONORED MEMBER
OF THE PARTY,

532
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:20,491

PAST THE GUARDS.

533
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,494
ONLY THE TOP,
MOST TRUSTED OFFICIALS
WILL BE ALLOWED IN.

534
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,871

FROM THE VIEWSCREENS.

535

FOR SURE, BUT I'M
AFRAID IT WILL BE

BE PART OF THE PLAN,

694
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,127
YAY!
YAY!

695
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,465
I'VE GOT TO HAVE
A CLOSE LOOK
AT HIM.

696
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,968
<i>MUST BE DECISIVE.</i>

697
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,303
<i>EVERY THOUGHT</i>

698
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,638
<i>DIRECTED TOWARD A GOAL.</i>

699
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,223
<i>THIS PLANET</i>

700
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,935
<i>CAN BECOME A PARADISE</i>

701
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,021
<i>IF WE ARE WILLING</i>
<i>TO PAY THE PRICE.</i>

702
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,277
<i>AS EACH CELL IN THE BODY</i>

703
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,237

00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,281
<i>OF THE ENTIRE</i>

705
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,367
GENTLEMEN, I WANT
A PICTURE OF YOU TWO

00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,745
WITH THE HERO OF
THE FATHERLAND

707
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,580
LISTENING TO THE
STIRRING<i> FUHRER'S</i> SPEECH.

708
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,958
GET THAT LIGHT
OVER THERE, PLEASE.

709
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,918
GET THIS LIGHT
AROUND HERE.

710
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,629
SMILE, GENTLEMEN.
TURN AROUND,
SMILE, AND--NOW.

HAIL<i> FUHRER!</i>
HAIL<i> FUHRER!</i>

715
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,946
THE<i> FUHRER</i>
HAS GIVEN US OUR ORDERS,

716
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,825
AND WE PLEDGE HIM OUR LIVES
IN THIS SACRED TASK.

717
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,451
DEATH TO ZEON!

718
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,244
DEATH TO ZEON!
DEATH TO ZEON!

719
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,788
DEATH TO ZEON!
DEATH TO ZEON!

720
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,999
DEATH TO ZEON!
DEATH TO ZEON!

721
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,625
DEATH TO ZEON!
DEATH TO ZEON!

722
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,923
DEFINITELY DRUGGED,
ALMOST COMATOSE.

723
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,466
WHAT DRUG?

724
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,053
I CAN'T IDENTIFY IT
WITHOUT A MEDI-COMP.

725
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,555
WITHOUT KNOWING,
AN ANTIDOTE
WOULD BE DANGEROUS.

726
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,472
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN DO?

727
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,141
I CAN GIVE HIM
A GENERAL STIMULANT,

728
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,018
BUT IT WOULD BE RISKY.

729
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,187
TAKE THE RISK.

730
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,357
[MELAKON]
DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS,

731
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,568
THEY REMAIN,
LIKE A CANCER,

732
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:17,861
EATING AWAY AT OUR STATE.

733
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,613
YAY!
YAY!

734
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,911
THERE'S NO REACTION.

735
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,787
WHATEVER YOU GAVE HIM
ISN'T WORKING.

736
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,415
BONES...

737
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,583
INCREASE THE DOSAGE.

738
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,586
I'M WORKING IN THE DARK.
I COULD KILL HIM.

739
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,047
IF THEY FIND US HERE,
WE'LL ALL BE KILLED.

740
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,007
10 MINUTES AGO,

741
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,259
ON OUR<i> FUHRER'S</i> ORDERS,

742
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,720
OUR TROOPS BEGAN
THEIR HISTORIC MISSION.

743
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,138
IN THE CITIES,

744
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,765
THE ELIMINATIONS
HAVE STARTED.

745
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,186
WITHIN AN HOUR,
THE ZEON BLIGHT WILL FOREVER

746
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,437
BE REMOVED FROM EKOS.

747
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,148
IT'S BEGUN.

748
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,275
IT'S FINALLY BEGUN.

749
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,319
THE STIMULANT'S
WORKING.

750
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,529
I NOW ANNOUNCE...

751
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,490
HE'S REACHING A LEVEL
OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

752
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,911
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
HE'S IN A LIGHT SLEEP.

753
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,747
NOW, THAT'S AS MUCH
AS I DARE DO.

754
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,666
OUR ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM
WILL FOREVER BE RID

755
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,293
OF THE DISEASE
THAT WAS ZEON.

756
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,628
SPOCK...

757
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,005
TRY TO GET
THROUGH TO HIM
WITH THE MIND PROBE.

758
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:20,590
IF YOU CAN'T, BONES,

759
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,718
YOU'LL HAVE TO USE
A STRONGER STIMULANT,

760
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,511
NO MATTER WHAT IT DOES.

761
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,933
OUR SPACE FLEET
IS ON ITS WAY TOWARD ZEON,

762
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,269
BOTH MANNED
AND UNMANNED WEAPONS.

763
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:43,947
THIS IS THE TIME
OF DESTINY.

764
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,157
HAIL VICTORY!

765
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,158
HAIL VICTORY!
HAIL VICTORY!

766
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,243
HAIL VICTORY!
HAIL VICTORY!

767
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,744
HAIL VICTORY!
HAIL VICTORY!

768
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,747
THERE'S
ONE CHANCE LEFT.

769
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,250
IF YOU'D USE
THE WEAPONS
YOU HAVE,

770
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,335
YOU
COULD DESTROY
THE FLEET.

771
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,921
THAT WOULD MEAN
THE DEATH OF THOUSANDS
OF EKOSIAN SPACE MEN.

772
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,841
I KNOW.
MANY OF MY FRIENDS
ARE ABOARD THAT SHIP,

773
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,592
MANY OF THE UNDERGROUND.

774
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,469
YES, BUT AGAINST
THOSE THOUSANDS

775
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,512
ARE MILLIONS
UPON MILLIONS

776
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,096
OF INNOCENT
ZEON LIVES.

777
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,764
YOU'VE
GOT TO CHOOSE

778
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,641
THE LESSER
OF TWO EVILS.

779
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,229
WE COULD SAVE ZEON...

780
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,482
BUT WHAT ABOUT EKOS?

781
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,650
CAPTAIN.

782
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,823
I'VE CREATED
A CONDITION

783
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:30,160
IN WHICH GILL
CANNOT INITIATE SPEECH
OR ANY OTHER ACTION,

784
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,162
BUT HE CAN REPLY
TO QUESTIONS.

785
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,122
WELL DONE, SPOCK.

786
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,460
THEY'VE KEPT
WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM
AS A FIGUREHEAD.

787
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,380
QUITE CORRECT.
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS,

788
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,632
THE REAL POWER
HAS BEEN MELAKON.

789
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,514
GILL.

790
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,059
GILL, WHY DID YOU
ABANDON YOUR MISSION?

791
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:57,896
WHY DID YOU INTERFERE
WITH THIS CULTURE?

792
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,943
PLANET...

793
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,279
FRAGMENTED...

794
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,947
DIVIDED.

795
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,160
TOOK LESSON
FROM EARTH HISTORY.

796
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:13,745
BUT WHY NAZI GERMANY?

797
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,540
YOU STUDIED HISTORY.
YOU KNEW WHAT THE NAZIS WERE.

798
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,127
MOST EFFICIENT
STATE...

799
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,170
EARTH EVER KNEW.

800
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,838
QUITE TRUE, CAPTAIN.

801
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,758
THAT TINY COUNTRY--
BEATEN, BANKRUPT,
DEFEATED,

802
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,552
ROSE IN A FEW YEARS
TO STAND

803
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,013
ONLY ONE STEP AWAY
FROM GLOBAL DOMINATION.

804
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,639
BUT IT WAS BRUTAL,
PERVERTED,

805
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,017
HAD TO BE DESTROYED
AT A TERRIBLE COST.

806
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,103
WHY THAT EXAMPLE?

807
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:42,481
PERHAPS GILL FELT
THAT SUCH A STATE,
RUN BENIGNLY,

808
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,984
COULD ACCOMPLISH
ITS EFFICIENCY
WITHOUT SADISM.

809
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,985
WHY, GILL?

810
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,529
WHY?

811
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,572
WORKED.

812
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,076
AT FIRST...

813
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,369
IT WORKED.

814
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,123
THEN MELAKON...

815
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,541
BEGAN TO TAKE OVER.

816
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,002
USED THE...

817
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,546
GAVE ME THE DRUG.

818
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,427
GILL.

819
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,220
GILL.

820
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,931
GILL, CAN YOU
HEAR ME?

821
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,767
YOU'VE GOT TO TELL
THOSE PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED!

822
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,770
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO
CAN PREVENT THE SLAUGHTER!

823
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,439
GILL!

824
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,449
HE'S STILL ALIVE,
BUT THE DRUG
THEY USE IS TOO STRONG.

825
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,533
IF I GIVE HIM
ANOTHER SHOT, WE'RE--

826
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,785
BONES, GIVE HIM
ANOTHER SHOT!

827
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,953
I DON'T DARE.

828
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,204
GUARD.

829
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,291
WE'VE RUN OUT
OF TIME, BONES.

830
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,627
NOW, WAIT.

831
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,922
AIM IT AT SPOCK.
SPOCK, TAKE OFF THE HELMET.

832
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,218
THE SECOND TIME

833
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,887
IN ONE DAY,
DARAS IS A HERO

834
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,389
TO THE FATHERLAND.

835
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,683
SHE CAPTURED
A ZEON SPY
THAT WAS ATTEMPTING

836
00:41:58,808 --> 00:41:59,934
TO ASSASSINATE
THE<i> FUHRER.</i>

837
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,311
GUARDS.

838
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,356
YES, LET US
MAKE AN EXAMPLE

839
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:07,484
OF THIS TRAITOR
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

840
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:12,030
WE'LL MAKE A PRESENT
OF HIM TO MELAKON.

841
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,616
CHAIRMAN ENEG,

842
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,119
THIS SPY MUST BE TAKEN
TO MELAKON.

843
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,543
PASS THEM
ON MY RESPONSIBILITY.

844
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,760
ENEG IS ONE OF US.

845
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,849
STAY CLOSE TO SPOCK.

846
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:42,560
STALL FOR TIME.

847
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,522
AND HOPE.

848
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,820
WHAT IS THIS?

849
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:53,946
A SPY, EXCELLENCY.

850
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,281
A RARE PRIZE.

851
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:57,325
THE DEPUTY<i> FUHRER</i>
CAN SEE

852
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,118
THIS IS
NO ORDINARY ZEON.

853
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,287
NOT A ZEON,
DEFINITELY NOT.

854
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,389
PROFESSOR GILL...

855
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,267
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

856
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,520
YOU'VE GOT TO SPEAK.

857
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,147
YOU'VE GOT TO SPEAK.

858
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,858
THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE.

859
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:33,319
GILL.

860
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,159
THE DEPUTY<i> FUHRER</i>
IS AN AUTHORITY

861
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,787
ON THE GENETICS
OF RACIAL PURITY.

862
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,457
HOW WOULD YOU
CLASSIFY THIS ONE?

863
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:48,209
VERY DIFFICULT.

864
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,253
NOTE
THE SINISTER EYES

865
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,756
AND THE MALFORMED
EARS.

866
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,758
DEFINITELY
AN INFERIOR RACE.

867
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,510
