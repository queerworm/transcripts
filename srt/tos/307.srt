00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,834
FULL SCAN.

00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:29,834
RESULTS--NEGATIVE.

4
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:31,500
RADIATION LEVEL--NORMAL.

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,542
ATMOSPHERE AND TERRAIN
ARE UNDISTURBED.

6
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:35,875
NO EVIDENCE OF A COLONY

7
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,041
NOR ANY RESIDUAL
AFTEREFFECT OF A FORCE

8
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,166
THAT MIGHT HAVE
ANNIHILATED IT.

9
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,291
LIFE READINGS, DR. McCOY?

10
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,250
NOTHING. THEY SAID
THEY WERE
BEING ATTACKED

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,000
BY AN UNIDENTIFIED SHIP.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,500
WHICH WE WERE UNABLE TO
DETECT UPON APPROACH.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,417
AN ENTIRE HUMAN COLONY.

14
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:53,041
A WHOLE SETTLEMENT.

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,500
100 MEN, WOMEN,
AND CHILDREN.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,291
WHO DID IT?

17
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,917
AND WHY?

18
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:04,041
[COMMUNICATOR BEEPS]

19
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,041
KIRK HERE.

20
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,166
SPOCK HERE, CAPTAIN.

21
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,333
SENSORS HAVE PICKED UP
A KLINGON SHIP,

22
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,583
CLOSING FAST.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,583
DEFLECTORS ON.
CONDITION RED.

24
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,959
PROTECT YOURSELVES.

25
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,417
TOTAL REPLY
IF ATTACKED.

26
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:17,917
SO THAT'S THE ANSWER--

27
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:18,583
KLINGONS.

28
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,291
TROUBLE ABOARD
THE KLINGON SHIP.

29
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,125
EVIDENCE OF EXPLOSIONS,

30
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,542
MASSIVE DESTRUCTION.

31
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,083
CAPTAIN, THE ENEMY SHIP
IS DRIFTING,

32
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,000
TOTALLY DISABLED,

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,959
AND WE NEVER FIRED
UPON HER.

34
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,375
MAINTAIN RED ALERT.

35
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,166
[FOOTSTEPS]

36
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,834
YOU ATTACKED MY SHIP!

37
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:51,125
400 OF MY CREW DEAD.

38
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,875
KIRK, MY SHIP IS DISABLED.

39
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,083
I CLAIM YOURS.

40
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,166
YOU ARE NOW PRISONERS
OF THE KLINGON EMPIRE

41
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,583
AGAINST WHICH YOU'VE COMMITTED
A WANTON ACT OF WAR!

42
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,542
Kirk: SPACE--THE FINAL FRONTIER.

43
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:29,083
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

44
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,750
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--

45
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,458
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

46
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:37,458
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

47
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,250
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

48
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,041
FOR 3 YEARS,
THE FEDERATION AND
THE KLINGON EMPIRE

49
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,917
HAVE BEEN AT PEACE,

50
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:34,000
A TREATY WE HAVE HONORED
TO THE LETTER.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,458
WE TOOK NO ACTION
AGAINST YOUR SHIP, KANG.

52
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,083
WERE THE SCREAMS
OF MY CREW IMAGINARY?

53
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,625
WHAT WERE YOUR
ORDERS, KIRK?

54
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,083
TO START A WAR?
YOU'VE SUCCEEDED.

55
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,166
TO TEST A NEW WEAPON?
WE SHALL BE HAPPY
TO EXAMINE IT.

56
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,834
THERE WAS A FEDERATION
COLONY ON THIS PLANET.

57
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:49,834
IT WAS DESTROYED.

58
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,250
BY WHAT?

59
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,333
NO BODIES,
NO RUINS.

60
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,208
A COLONY
OF THE INVISIBLE?

61
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,959
YES, A TEST OF A NEW
KLINGON WEAPON,

62
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,208
LEAVING NO TRACES.

63
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,959
FEDERATION SHIPS
DON'T SPECIALIZE
IN SNEAK ATTACKS.

64
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,083
WE HAVE WONDERED
WHEN YOU WOULD BEGIN.

65
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,583
YOU LURED MY SHIP
INTO AMBUSH

66
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,083
BY A FALSE KLINGON
DISTRESS CALL.

67
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,125
YOU WILL TELL US WHY
WITH THE PROPER PERSUASION.

68
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,500
YOU RECEIVED
A DISTRESS CALL?

69
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,250
WE RECEIVED
A DISTRESS CALL.

70
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,917
I DON'T PROPOSE TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

71
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:24,000
ON THIS BALL OF DUST,
ARGUING YOUR FANTASIES.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,417
THE "ENTERPRISE" IS MINE!

73
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,291
INSTRUCT YOUR TRANSPORTER
ROOM TO BEAM US ABOARD.

74
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,458
GO TO THE DEVIL.

75
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,417
WE HAVE NO DEVIL, KIRK.

76
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,583
BUT WE UNDERSTAND
THE HABITS OF YOURS.

77
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,125
I SHALL TORTURE YOU...

78
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,041
TO DEATH...

79
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,250
ONE BY ONE...

80
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,041
UNTIL YOUR NOBLE CAPTAIN
CRIES "ENOUGH."

81
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,625
WHO WILL BE FIRST?

82
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,250

83
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,417

00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:26,542

100 PEACEFUL PEOPLE

87
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,375
JUST LIKE YOU DID HERE.

88
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,500
MY BROTHER--YOU KILLED HIM.

89
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,083
AND YOU VOLUNTEER
TO JOIN HIM.

90
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,125
THAT IS LOYALTY.

91
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,917
AAH!

93
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,208
STOP THE TORTURE!

94
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:02,792
JIM, YOU CAN'T HAND OVER
THE "ENTERPRISE."

95
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:03,750
HELP CHEKOV.

96
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,959
DON'T PLAN ANY TRICKS,
KIRK.

97
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,208
I WILL KILL 100 HOSTAGES

98
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,625
AT THE FIRST SIGN
OF TREACHERY.

99
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,250
I'LL BEAM YOU ABOARD
THE "ENTERPRISE."

100
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,917

00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,375
Chekov: CAPTAIN,
YOU CAN'T.

102
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,291
DON'T LET THESE ANIMALS
HAVE THE SHIP.

103
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,083
MOVE ASIDE.

104
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,208
Kang: ANIMALS?

105
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,667
YOUR CAPTAIN
CRAWLS LIKE ONE.

106
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,000
A KLINGON WOULD NEVER
HAVE SURRENDERED.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,959
ORDER EVERYBODY IN THIS AREA
TO BE TRANSPORTED UP.

108
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,000
ALL WEAPONS ON HIM.

109
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,458

"ENTERPRISE."

110
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,917
MR. SPOCK.

111
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,125
HERE, CAPTAIN.

112
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,458
MR. SPOCK,
WE HAVE GUESTS.

113
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,458
ADJUST TRANSPORTER
TO WIDE FIELD.

114
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,417
BEAM UP EVERYONE
IN THE TARGET AREA.

115
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,792
UNDERSTOOD, CAPTAIN.

116
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,375
TRANSPORTER ROOM.

117
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,125
FULL SECURITY, JOHNSON,
ON THE DOUBLE.

118
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,125
GOOD WORK, SPOCK.

119
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,083
WHAT HAPPENED?

120
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,709
OUR LANDING PARTY
IS INTACT, DOCTOR.

121
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,625
ALL OTHERS SUSPENDED
IN TRANSIT.

122
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,125
WHO ARE THE GUESTS,
BY THE WAY?

123
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,291
KLINGONS.

124
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,375
WELL, THEY'RE RIGHT
IN HERE.

125
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,375

126
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,834

127
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:58,000
CAPTAIN, LEAVE THEM
WHERE THEY ARE--

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,583
NONEXISTENCE.

129
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,625
THAT'S SO MANY LESS
KLINGON MONSTERS
IN THE GALAXY.

130
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,917
BRING THEM IN.

131
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,542
MOVE 'EM OUT. MOVE!

132
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,583
LIAR!

133
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:27,083
I SAID NO TRICKS AFTER
WE REACH THE SHIP.

134
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,834
YOU'RE A PRISONER
OF THE FEDERATION OF PLANETS

135
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,792
AGAINST WHICH YOU MAY
OR MAY NOT

136
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,583
HAVE COMMITTED
AN ACT OF WAR.

137
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,000
THERE ARE STILL
SURVIVORS ABOARD
MY SHIP.

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,750
CAPTAIN, WE'VE NOT BEEN
ABLE TO GET THROUGH
TO STARFLEET COMMAND.

139
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,125
ALL SUBSPACE FREQUENCIES
HAVE BEEN BLOCKED,

140
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,375
AND THERE'S TOO MUCH RADIATION
COMING FROM THAT KLINGON SHIP.

141
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,625
IT'S A HAZARD
TO THE VICINITY.

142
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,417
PREPARE TO DESTRUCT.

143
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,667
COMPLETING THE JOB
YOU STARTED?

144
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,667
YOU WOULDN'T BE STANDING
HERE IF I HAD.

145
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,458
FIRST GROUP FROM
THE KLINGON VESSEL,
CAPTAIN.

146
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,333
MY WIFE MARA
AND MY SCIENCE OFFICER.

147
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,166
KANG, WHAT HAS HAPPENED?

148
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,417
MORE FEDERATION
TREACHERY.

149
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,875
WE ARE PRISONERS.

150
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,166
WHAT WILL THEY DO TO US?

151
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:19,333
I'VE HEARD OF
THEIR ATROCITIES,
THEIR DEATH CAMPS.

152
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,792
THEY WILL TORTURE US
FOR OUR SCIENTIFIC AND
MILITARY INFORMATION.

153
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,500
APPARENTLY YOU HAVE
A FEW THINGS
TO LEARN ABOUT US.

154
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,458
DETAIN THEM
IN THE CREW LOUNGE.

155
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,125
PROGRAM
THE FOOD SYNTHESIZER

156
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,458
TO ACCOMMODATE
OUR GUESTS.

157
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,333
YOU'LL BE WELL-TREATED,
KANG.

158
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,333
SO I HAVE SEEN.

159
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,500
SECURE FROM RED ALERT.

160
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,000
BUT MAINTAIN
GENERAL QUARTERS.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,458
SCAN THIS SECTOR
FOR OTHER SHIPS.

162
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,583
RUN A FULL CHECK
ON THE COLONY.

163
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,417
I WANT THIS THING
NAILED DOWN FAST.

164
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,083
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
THAT DISTRESS CALL.

165
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,208
AT THE MOMENT
WE RECEIVED
THE DISTRESS SIGNAL

166
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,417
FROM THE COLONY
ON BETA 12-A,

167
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,917
THE KLINGONS WERE
TOO FAR DISTANT

168
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:59,333
TO HAVE BEEN
THE ATTACKERS.

169
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,792
MOREOVER, THEY ALSO WERE
APPARENTLY ATTRACTED

170
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,208
BY A DISTRESS CALL.

171
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,750
LIES. THEY WANT
TO START A WAR

172
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,333
BY PRETENDING
THAT WE DID.

173
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,417
CHEKOV MAY BE RIGHT.

174
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,458
THE KLINGONS CLAIM
TO HAVE HONORED
THE TRUCE,

175
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,208
BUT THERE HAVE
BEEN INCIDENTS,

176
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,792
RAIDS ON
OUR OUTPOSTS.

177
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,667
NO PROOF THAT
THE KLINGONS
COMMITTED IT.

178
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,417
WHAT PROOF
DO WE NEED?

179
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:23,333
WE KNOW
WHAT A KLINGON IS.

180
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,750
OUR LOG TAPES WILL
INDICATE OUR INNOCENCE

181
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,959
IN THE PRESENT SITUATION.

182
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,625
UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE

183
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,709
THAT THEY WILL
BE BELIEVED.

184
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,417
REPORT.

185
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,542
STILL NO CONTACT WITH
STARFLEET COMMAND, SIR.

186
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,041
OUTSIDE COMMUNICATIONS
BLANKETED.

187
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,500
KEEP TRYING. WE'VE GOT
A DIPLOMATIC TIGER
BY THE TAIL.

188
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,083
Scotty:
TRANSPORTER ROOM
TO BRIDGE.

189
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,542
KLINGON SHIP
IS VACATED, SIR.

190
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,583
VERY GOOD, SCOTTY.
MR. SULU?

191
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,166
FORWARD PHASERS
LOCKED AND READY
TO FIRE, SIR.

192
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,125
FIRE PHASERS.

193
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,417
SENSOR SWEEPS
REVEAL NO OTHER SHIPS
WITHIN RANGE, CAPTAIN.

194
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:11,500
LIEUTENANT UHURA?

195
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,792
NO CONTACT
WITH STARFLEET
AS YET, SIR.

196
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,959
MR. SULU, CHANGE COURSE
TO 17 MARK 4,

197
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,125
WARP FACTOR 3.

198
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,375
WARP FACTOR 3, SIR.

199
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,458
WHEN I TAKE THIS SHIP,

200
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,709
I'LL HAVE KIRK'S HEAD
STUFFED AND HUNG
ON HIS CABIN WALL.

201
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:48,166
THEY WILL KILL US
BEFORE WE CAN ACT.

202
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,375
NO, THEY WISH
TO QUESTION US,

203
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,875
LEARN OUR STRENGTH,
OUR PLANS.

204
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,291
THEY NEVER WILL.

205
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,709
WE ARE 40 AGAINST 400.

206
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,834
4,000 THROATS
MAY BE CUT
IN ONE NIGHT

207
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,250
BY
A RUNNING MAN.

208
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,458
PATIENCE. VIGILANCE.

209
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,834
THEY WILL MAKE
THEIR MISTAKE.

210
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,834
CAPTURE OF THE "ENTERPRISE"
WILL GIVE US KNOWLEDGE

211
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,542
TO END THIS WAR QUICKLY.

212
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,542
CAPTAIN!

213
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,709
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

214
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:30,250
CARRIERS ARE NORMAL.
CHANNELS ARE OPEN.

215
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,709
THERE'S STILL NO
OUTSIDE CONTACT!

216
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,041
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT, SIR.

217
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,500
COULD THE KLINGONS
BE DOING SOMETHING?

218
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,041
SULU?

219
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,166
CHANGE IN COURSE,
ACCELERATING.

220
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,375
HELM DEAD.

221
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,375
AUXILIARY NAVIGATION
DEAD.

222
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,333
OVERRIDE.

223
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,500
NOTHING RESPONDS,
CAPTAIN.

224
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,667
SCOTTY, STOP ALL ENGINES.

225
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,500
I WOULD IF I COULD, SIR,

226
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,333
BUT THE CONTROLS
HAVE GONE CRAZY.

227
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,458
SOMETHING'S TAKEN OVER.

228
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,667
SCOTTY!

229
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:20,166
THE ENGINES, SIR.
THEY'VE GONE TO WARP 9

230
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,542
BY THEMSELVES!

231
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:23,875
NEW COURSE?

232
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,500
Sulu:
9-0-2, MARK 5.

233
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,792
THAT'LL TAKE US
OUT OF THE GALAXY.

234
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,333
CAPTAIN, REPORTS COMING IN
FROM THE LOWER DECKS.

235
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,667
EMERGENCY BULKHEADS
HAVE CLOSED.

236
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,625
ALMOST 400 CREWMEN ARE
TRAPPED DOWN THERE, SIR.

237
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,667
MOST INTERESTING.

238
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,000
THE BULK OF
YOUR CREW TRAPPED,

239
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,208
YOUR SHIP RACING
FROM THIS GALAXY

240
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,583
AT WILD SPEEDS?

241
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,542
DELIGHTFUL.

242
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,959
HOW DID I PERFORM
THIS SABOTAGE, KIRK?

243
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,667
ALL MY MEN ARE HERE.

244
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,625
JOHNSON.

245
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,083
GET DOWN TO SECURITY.
SEARCH EVERY SECTION.

246
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,667
SOME KLINGONS MAY HAVE
BEAMED ABOARD UNDETECTED
FROM THE WRECKED SHIP.

247
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,000
THEN GET DOWN TO ENGINEERING
AND HELP SCOTTY

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,750
HAMMER THINGS
BACK TO NORMAL.

249
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,000
AND FREE THOSE
TRAPPED CREWMEN.

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,458
AND BEFORE I PUT YOU
IN THE BRIG,

251
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,375
THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
I OWE YOU.

252
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,834
PHASERS.

253
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,375
OUT!

254
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,458
STAND AND FIGHT,
YOU COWARD.

255
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,917
SICK BAY.

256
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,375
BRIDGE.

257
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,709
THE KLINGONS ARE FREE.
THEY'RE ARMED AS WE ARE.

258
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,083
THEY'LL TRY
AND TAKE THE SHIP.

259
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,458
SCOTTY, HOW MANY MEN
DO WE HAVE?

260
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,583
Scotty:
392 TRAPPED BELOW DECKS.

261
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,375
DEPLOY FORCES TO PROTECT
YOUR SECTION

262
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,917
AND THE AUXILIARY
CONTROL CENTER.

263
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:51,583
CHECK THE ARMORY

264
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,583
AND TRY AND FREE
THOSE TRAPPED CREWMEN.

265
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,041
THE DOORS AND BULKHEADS
WON'T BUDGE.

266
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,750
WE'LL HAVE
TO CUT THROUGH.

267
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,333
BLOW OUT THE BULKHEADS
IF YOU HAVE TO.
WE NEED NUMBERS.

268
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,250
WHAT KIND OF LUCK
HAVE YOU HAD CONTROLLING
THE SHIP'S SPEED?

269
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,542
NO, SIR.
SHE'S A PROJECTILE
AT WARP 9.

270
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,542
AND DON'T ASK ME WHAT'S
HOLDING HER TOGETHER.

271
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,542
5-MINUTE REPORT, SCOTTY.
KIRK OUT.

272
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:09,792
FULL SENSOR SCAN
OF THE SHIP.

273
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,625
REPORT ON ANY MOVEMENT
BY THE KLINGONS.

274
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,041
THE KLINGON EMPIRE
HAS MAINTAINED
A DUELING TRADITION.

275
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,750
THEY THINK THEY CAN
BEAT US WITH SWORDS.

276
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,000
CAPTAIN, NEITHER THE KLINGON
TECHNOLOGY NOR OURS

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,750
IS CAPABLE OF THIS--

278
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,875
THE INSTANTANEOUS
TRANSMUTATION OF MATTER.

279
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,250
I DOUBT THAT THEY
ARE RESPONSIBLE.

280
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,375
ANY OTHER
LOGICAL CANDIDATE?

281
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,667
NONE.

282
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,458
HOWEVER, IF THEY HAD
SUCH POWER,

283
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,583
WOULD THEY NOT HAVE USED IT

284
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,750
TO CREATE
MORE EFFECTIVE WEAPONS

285
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,834
AND ONLY FOR THEMSELVES?

286
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,000
MR. SULU.

287
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,166
GET BELOW.

288
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,625
TAKE COMMAND
OF ENGINEERING

289
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,625
AND AUXILIARY CONTROL.

290
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,625
AYE, SIR.

291
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,625
CAPTAIN.

292
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,625
MR. CHEKOV.

293
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,834
CAPTAIN!

294
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:50,834
MR. CHEKOV,
AS YOU WERE.

295
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:51,834
CHEKOV!

296
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:55,375
SIR, LET ME GO, TOO.

297
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,542
I GOT A PERSONAL SCORE
TO SETTLE WITH THE KLINGONS.

298
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:59,917
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR A VENDETTA.
MAINTAIN YOUR POST.

299
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:00,959
CAPTAIN.

300
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,583
CHEKOV, MAINTAIN
YOUR POST.

301
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,500
DON'T TRY TO STOP ME,
CAPTAIN.

302
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,375
I SAW WHAT THEY LEFT
OF PIOTRE,

303
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,041
AND I SWORE ON HIS GRAVE

304
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,542
I WOULD AVENGE
HIS MURDER.

305
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,625
WHAT'S CHEKOV'S GRUDGE
AGAINST THE KLINGONS?

306
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,792
WHO'S PIOTRE?

307
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,125
HIS ONLY BROTHER,
KILLED IN A KLINGON RAID.

308
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,792
HIS BROTHER?
HE NEVER HAD A BROTHER.

309
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,959
HE'S AN ONLY CHILD.

310
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,542
SULU, GET DOWN
TO ENGINEERING.

311
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,875
AYE, SIR.

312
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,250
SECURITY,
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

313
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,667
FIND MR. CHEKOV
AND BRING HIM
TO THE BRIDGE.

314
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:42,166
CAPTAIN, WHY WOULD, WHY WOULD
CHEKOV

315
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,667
BELIEVE HE HAS
A BROTHER?

316
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:48,875
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT HE DOES.

317
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,583
AND NOW HE WANTS REVENGE

318
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,917
FOR A NONEXISTENT LOSS.

319
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:12,625
THERE.
THOSE FILTHY BUTCHERS.

320
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,208
THERE ARE RULES, EVEN IN WAR.

321
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:17,750
YOU DON'T KEEP HACKING
AT A MAN AFTER HE'S DOWN.

322
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,083
HAND ME THAT
NUMANOL CAPSULE.

323
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,917
LAYOUT AND SPECIFICATIONS
OF THE "ENTERPRISE,"

324
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,542
COMMANDER.

325
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:54,834
ENEMY NUMBERS ARE
THE SAME AS OURS.

326
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,500
WE HAVE
A FIGHTING BALANCE.

327
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,333
THEN WE TAKE THE SHIP.

328
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,542
A SHIP THAT IS HEADED
TOWARDS THE END
OF THE GALAXY?

329
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:03,000
IN TIME, IN TIME.

330
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,959
WE MUST TAKE THESE SECTIONS.

331
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,417
FIRST--ENGINEERING.

332
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,917
Kirk: KIRK HERE.

333
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:10,458
SCOTT HERE, SIR.

334
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,583
THERE'S NO USE TRYING TO FREE
THOSE MEN DOWN BELOW.

335
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,792
THE PHASER TORCHES, THEY WON'T
CUT THROUGH THE BULKHEADS,

336
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,917
NOR THE DOORS,
NOR THE DECKS.

337
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,250
THERE'S SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO THE METAL.

338
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,625
Kirk: WHAT ABOUT
THE ARMORY?

339
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,208
I'M THERE NOW, SIR,

340
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,834
AND YOU NEVER SAW
SUCH A FINE COLLECTION

341
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:29,333
OF ANTIQUES IN YOUR LIFE.

342
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,875
GET BACK
TO ENGINEERING.

343
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,875
TRY AND RE-ESTABLISH
ENGINE CONTROL,

344
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,375
AND TALK TO
ORDNANCE ABOUT

345
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,000
MANUFACTURING PHASER
REPLACEMENTS.

346
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,959
AYE, SIR.

347
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,041
A CLAYMORE.

348
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,917
YOU'RE A BEAUTY.

349
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,792
WHAT IN BLAZES
IS GOING ON?

350
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:02,000
SCANS INDICATE
THAT OUR FORCES

351
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,625
AND THOSE OF
THE KLINGONS

352
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,875
ARE EXACTLY EQUAL
AT 38 EACH.

353
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,917
THE KLINGONS
CONTROL DECK 6

354
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,166
AND STARBOARD
DECK 7

355
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,458
WHILE WE CONTROL
ALL SECTIONS ABOVE.

356
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,792
CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE,
MR. SPOCK.

357
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,375
MOST CURIOUS, CAPTAIN.

358
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,166
THERE APPEAR TO BE MORE
LIFE-ENERGY UNITS ON BOARD

359
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,667
THAN CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR
BY THE PRESENCE

360
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:26,792
OF THE "ENTERPRISE" CREW
PLUS THE KLINGONS.

361
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,542
A CONSIDERABLE DISCREPANCY.

362
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:31,166
COULD MORE KLINGONS
HAVE BEAMED ABOARD?

363
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,750
I SHALL ATTEMPT
A COMPENSATORY READING

364
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,000
OF KLINGON UNITS.

365
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,750
ANY SIGNS OF THOSE
DEVILS, MR. SULU?

366
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,834
ALL CLEAR, MR. SCOTT.

367
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,333
THEY'VE TAKEN
ENGINEERING.

368
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,959
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
MORE OF THOSE KLINGONS
ARE AROUND,

369
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,333
BUT WE'LL SPLIT UP HERE

370
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,125
AND TRY TO MAKE IT BACK
TO THE BRIDGE.
AYE.

371
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,875
VICTORY!
VICTORY!

372
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,542
VICTORY!
VICTORY!

373
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,875
NO ADDITIONAL KLINGONS
DETECTED, CAPTAIN.

374
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,333
IT IS AN ALIEN LIFE FORCE,

375
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,041
A SINGLE ENTITY.

376
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,583
AN ALIEN LIFE FORCE.

377
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:05,083
WE MUST MAKE CONTACT,

378
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,250
FIND OUT WHAT IT WANTS.

379
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,250
READINGS BEING DIVERTED
TO THE LIBRARY COMPUTER

380
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,709
FOR ANALYSIS.

381
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:14,959
COMPUTER, REPORT.

382
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,667
Computer voice:
ALIEN LIFE FORCE ON BOARD
IS COMPOSED OF PURE ENERGY.

383
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,125
TYPE UNKNOWN.

384
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,250
ACTIONS INDICATE
INTELLIGENCE AND PURPOSE.

385
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,166
WHAT PURPOSE?

386
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,166
INSUFFICIENT DATA
FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.

387
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,208
A BROTHER THAT
NEVER EXISTED.

388
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,291
A PHANTOM COLONY.

389
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,125
IMAGINARY
DISTRESS CALLS.

390
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:40,709
THE CREATION OF
THESE...WEAPONS.

391
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:45,083
DO YOU SENSE
A PATTERN,
MR. SPOCK?

392
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,875
IF THE ALIEN IS CREATING
THESE EVENTS, CAPTAIN,

393
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,583
IT IS APPARENTLY CAPABLE

394
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:53,125
OF MANIPULATING
MATTER AND MIND.

395
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,125
AND NOW IT HAS CONTROL
OF THE "ENTERPRISE"

396
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,542
AND TAKING US
OUT OF THE GALAXY.

397
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,041
BUT WHY?

398
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,875
CAPTAIN, I AM CONSTRAINED
TO POINT OUT

399
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,667
THAT SINCE MINDS
ARE EVIDENTLY
BEING INFLUENCED,

400
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,709
WE CANNOT KNOW
AT THIS MOMENT

401
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:08,083
WHETHER OUR OWN MEMORIES

402
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,667
ARE COMPLETELY ACCURATE
AND TRUE.

403
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,542
WE MUST TALK TO KANG,

404
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,083
BURY THE HATCHET.

405
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,166
AN APPROPRIATE
CHOICE OF TERMS, CAPTAIN.

406
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,667
HOWEVER, IT IS
NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT

407
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,750
TO ARRANGE A TRUCE
WITH THE KLINGONS

408
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,583
ONCE BLOOD HAS BEEN DRAWN.

409
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:23,875
TRUCE?

410
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,792
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

411
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,458
I'VE GOT MEN
IN SICK BAY,

412
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,125
SOME OF THEM DYING.

413
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,709
ATROCITIES COMMITTED
ON THEIR PERSONS,

414
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:34,750
AND YOU TALK ABOUT
MAKING PEACE
WITH THESE FIENDS?

415
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,667
IF OUR BACKS
WERE TURNED,

416
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,083
THEY'D JUMP US
IN A MINUTE.

417
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,166
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT KLINGONS DO
TO PRISONERS--

418
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,959
SLAVE LABOR,
DEATH PLANETS,
EXPERIMENTS!

419
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,458
McCOY...
WHILE YOU'RE
TALKING,

420
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,041
THEY'RE PLANNING
ATTACKS.

421
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,917
THIS IS A FIGHT
TO THE DEATH.

422
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,959
WE'D BETTER START
TRYING TO WIN IT!

423
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:52,250
WE ARE ATTEMPTING
TO END IT, DOCTOR,

424
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,542
BY REASON, PREFERABLY.

425
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:55,917
THERE IS AN ALIEN ON BOARD

426
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,792
WHICH MAY HAVE CREATED
THIS SITUATION.

427
00:23:57,792 --> 00:23:59,959
WHO CARES WHAT
STARTED IT,
MR. SPOCK?

428
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:02,709
WE'RE IN IT!
THOSE MURDERERS.

429
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:04,792
WE SHOULD WIPE OUT
EVERY ONE OF THEM!

430
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:06,417
THE ALIEN
IS THE REAL THREAT.

431
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:09,291
THAT'S THE ENEMY
WE HAVE TO WIPE OUT.

432
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,333
SICK BAY CALLING, DOCTOR.

433
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,583
THERE ARE MORE WOUNDED MEN
REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION.

434
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,792
HOW MANY MORE MEN
MUST DIE

435
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,750
BEFORE YOU TWO
BEGIN TO ACT LIKE
MILITARY MEN

436
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,834
INSTEAD OF FOOLS?

437
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,500
[INTERCOM SIGNAL]

438
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:36,625
KIRK HERE.

439
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,208
THIS IS KANG.

440
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,500
KANG, THERE'S
SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I MUST DISCUSS WITH YOU.

441
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,583
I HAVE CAPTURED YOUR
ENGINEERING SECTION

442
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,709
AND NOW CONTROL
THIS SHIP'S POWER

443
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,750
AND LIFE-SUPPORT
SYSTEMS.

444
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,041
I HAVE DEPRIVED
ALL AREAS
EXCEPT OUR OWN.

445
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:59,458
YOU WILL DIE
OF SUFFOCATION

446
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,542
IN THE ICY COLD
OF SPACE.

447
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,875
THE ENTERPRISE IS HEADING
OUT OF OUR GALAXY,

448
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:31,125
CONTROLLED BY
A MYSTERIOUS ALIEN

449
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,166
SOMEWHERE ABOARD THE SHIP.

450
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:37,083
ENGINEERING HAS BEEN
TAKEN OVER BY KLINGONS

451
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,959
WHO HAVE CUT OFF
LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEMS.

452
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,250
MR. SULU.
CAPTAIN.

453
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,875
GET DOWN TO EMERGENCY
MANUAL CONTROL.

454
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,792
TRY TO PROTECT OUR LIFE-SUPPORT
CIRCUITS AND AUXILIARY POWER.

455
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:46,917
AYE, CAPTAIN.

456
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,166
SIR. CHEKOV WAS RIGHT,
CAPTAIN.

457
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,208
SCOTTY, I'M GLAD
YOU'VE COME.

458
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:56,542
WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT
THOSE FUZZ-FACED GOONS
IN THE TRANSPORTER.

459
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:57,959
THAT'S RIGHT
WHERE THEY BELONG!

460
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,125
SCOTTY.

461
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,667
NONEXISTENCE!

462
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,500
NOW THEY CAN STUDY
THE "ENTERPRISE,"

463
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,041
ADD OUR TECHNOLOGY
TO THEIRS,

464
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,500
CHANGE THE BALANCE
OF POWER.

465
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,458
YOU'VE JEOPARDIZED
THE FEDERATION!

466
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:09,458
SCOTTY.

467
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:10,417
EASY, MR. SCOTT.

468
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:13,917
KEEP YOUR VULCAN HANDS
OFF ME.

469
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:16,125
JUST KEEP AWAY!

470
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,208
YOUR FEELINGS
MIGHT BE HURT,

471
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:21,875
YOU GREEN-BLOODED
HALF-BREED!

472
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:26,166
MAY I SAY THAT I HAVE
NOT THOROUGHLY ENJOYED
SERVING WITH HUMANS?

473
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:29,083
I FIND THEIR ILLOGIC
AND FOOLISH EMOTIONS

474
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,458
A CONSTANT IRRITANT.

475
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,792
THEN TRANSFER OUT! FREAK!

476
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:38,917
GENTLEMEN!

477
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:41,834
SPOCK!

478
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,083
SCOTTY.

479
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,834
SPOCK. SPOCK!

480
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:48,333
STOP IT!
YOU'RE HALF HUMAN!

481
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,291
WHAT ARE WE SAYING?

482
00:26:57,291 --> 00:27:00,917
WHAT ARE WE DOING
TO EACH OTHER?

483
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:03,291
FASCINATING.

484
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,333
A RESULT OF STRESS?

485
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,625
WE'VE BEEN UNDER
STRESS BEFORE.

486
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,583
IT'S NEVER SET US

487
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,333
AT EACH OTHER'S
THROATS.

488
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,166
BUT THIS IS WAR.

489
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,291
THERE ISN'T
ANY WAR!

490
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,834
OR IS THERE?

491
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,667
HAVE WE FORGOTTEN
HOW TO DEFEND OURSELVES?

492
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,625
SCOTTY.

493
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,166
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO US?

494
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,959
WE'VE BEEN
TRAINED TO THINK

495
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:29,125
IN OTHER TERMS
THAN WAR.

496
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:33,041
WE'VE BEEN TRAINED
TO FIGHT ITS CAUSES,
IF NECESSARY.

497
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,041
THEN WHY ARE
WE BEHAVING

498
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:37,333
LIKE A GROUP
OF SAVAGES?

499
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:40,000
LOOK AT ME.

500
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,500
LOOK AT ME.

501
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,917
TWO FORCES
ABOARD THIS SHIP,

502
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,458
EACH OF THEM
EQUALLY ARMED.

503
00:27:55,959 --> 00:28:00,458
HAS A WAR BEEN
STAGED FOR US,

504
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,583
COMPLETE
WITH WEAPONS

505
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:05,417
AND IDEOLOGY

506
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,291
AND PATRIOTIC
DRUM-BEATING?

507
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:09,500
EVEN...

508
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,500
SPOCK.

509
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,333
EVEN...

510
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,125
RACE HATRED?

511
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,458
RECENT EVENTS WOULD
SEEM TO BE DIRECTED

512
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:23,542
TOWARD A MAGNIFICATION
OF THE BASIC HOSTILITIES

513
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:26,125
BETWEEN HUMANS
AND KLINGONS.

514
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:29,333
APPARENTLY, IT IS BY DESIGN
THAT WE FIGHT.

515
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,291
WE SEEM TO BE PAWNS.

516
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:34,792
BUT WHAT'S THE GAME?

517
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:36,417
AND WHOSE?

518
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,250
AND WHAT ARE
THE RULES?

519
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,291
IT IS MOST URGENT

520
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:43,291
THAT WE LOCATE
THE ALIEN ENTITY IMMEDIATELY

521
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,750
AND DETERMINE ITS MOTIVES

522
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,000
AND A METHOD FOR HALTING
ITS ACTIVITIES.

523
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,125
WITHOUT SENSORS?

524
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,625
ALL OUR POWER DOWN?

525
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,875
THIS THING
COULD GO ANYWHERE.

526
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,083
YES.

527
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,125
MR. SULU, REPORT.

00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:25,083
KANG.

707
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,834
KANG, THIS IS
CAPTAIN KIRK.

708
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:30,041
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME,
SO DON'T CUT ME OFF.

709
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:33,208
WE HAVE MARA, YOUR WIFE.

710
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:36,000
WE TALK TRUCE NOW,

711
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,458
OR SHE DIES. REPLY.

712
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,917
SHE HAS 5 SECONDS
TO LIVE.

713
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:45,125
REPLY.

714
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,709
SHE IS A VICTIM
OF WAR, CAPTAIN.

715
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,417
SHE UNDERSTANDS.

716
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,667
HE CALLED MY BLUFF.

717
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,458
YOU'RE NOT GOING--

718
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:08,125
THE FEDERATION DOESN'T
KILL OR MISTREAT
ITS PRISONERS.

719
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,750
YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING
TO PROPAGANDA FABLES.
HOW MUCH TIME?

720
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,458
8 MINUTES, 42 SECONDS.

721
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:17,500
SO THIS WAS NO TRICK?

722
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,959
IT'S THE ALIEN
THAT'S DONE THIS.

723
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:21,500
WE'RE
IN ITS POWER,

724
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,166
OUR PEOPLE
AND YOURS.

725
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,875
WE ONLY WANTED TO
STOP THE FIGHTING
TO SAVE US ALL.

726
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,917
WE HAVE ALWAYS
FOUGHT.

727
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,917
WE MUST.

728
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:31,917
WE ARE HUNTERS,
CAPTAIN,

729
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,750
TRACKING AND TAKING
WHAT WE NEED.

730
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:39,083
THERE ARE POOR PLANETS
IN THE KLINGON SYSTEMS.

731
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:41,500
WE MUST PUSH OUTWARD
IF WE ARE TO SURVIVE.

732
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,208
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY
TO SURVIVE--

733
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:46,375
MUTUAL TRUST
AND HELP.

734
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:57,291
I WILL HELP YOU NOW.

735
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,625
HOW?

736
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:01,333
I WILL TAKE YOU TO KANG.

737
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,500
I WILL ADD MY VOICE
TO YOURS.

738
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,625
I WOULDN'T TRUST HER,
CAPTAIN.

739
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:10,959
WE CAN'T GET THROUGH
THE KLINGON DEFENSES
IN TIME

740
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:11,959
UNLESS...

741
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,458
SPOCK.

742
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:18,959
INTRASHIP BEAMING.

743
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:19,875
FROM ONE SECTION
TO ANOTHER,

744
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:21,333
IT'S POSSIBLE?

745
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:24,208
IT HAS RARELY BEEN DONE
BECAUSE OF THE DANGER
INVOLVED.

746
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,625
PINPOINT ACCURACY
IS REQUIRED.

747
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:30,041
IF THE TRANSPORTEE
SHOULD MATERIALIZE
INSIDE A SOLID OBJECT,

748
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,625
A DECK OR A WALL--

749
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:33,792
EVEN IF
IT COULD WORK,

750
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:36,875
SHE MAY BE
LEADING YOU
INTO A TRAP.

751
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:38,750
WE'RE ALL IN A TRAP.
THIS IS THE ONLY
WAY OUT.

752
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,792
WE'LL GO
WITH YOU.

753
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:43,000
NO. IT'LL START
THE FINAL BATTLE.

754
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:48,333
I BELIEVE HER.

755
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:55,083
PREPARE THE TRANSPORTER.
WE'LL WAIT FOR YOUR SIGNAL.

756
00:42:57,125 --> 00:43:00,250
BUT SHE CAN'T GUARANTEE
THAT KANG WILL STOP
TO LISTEN,

757
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,166
RIGHT, MR. SPOCK?

758
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:05,000
NO ONE CAN GUARANTEE
THE ACTIONS OF ANOTHER.

759
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:17,709
YOUR AUTOMATIC SETTING
IS LAID IN, CAPTAIN.

760
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:19,625
WHEN TRANSPORTER
IS ENERGIZED,

761
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:22,917
YOU'LL HAVE 8 SECONDS
TO GET TO THE PADS.

762
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:25,750
I HOPE YOUR COMPUTATIONS
ARE CORRECT, MR. SPOCK.

763
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,333
YOU'LL KNOW IN
7.9 SECONDS,
CAPTAIN.

764
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,083
MARA, YOU'RE ALIVE.

765
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:51,458
AND YOU BRING US
A PRIZE.

766
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:52,667
KANG, WAIT.

767
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,500
HE'S COME ALONE,
UNARMED.

768
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,458
HE MUST TALK TO YOU.

769
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,417
BRAVE CAPTAIN,
WHAT ABOUT?

770
00:43:58,417 --> 00:43:59,750
NO!

771
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,166
LISTEN TO HIM.

772
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:02,750
WE ARE ALL
IN DANGER.

773
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,875
MARA. BEFORE
YOU START KILLING,
GIVE ME ONE MINUTE.

774
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,667
KANG, DON'T!

775
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,834
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE
TO YOU, MARA?

776
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:11,792
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

777
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:12,959
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE
TO YOU?

778
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:21,500
I SEE WHY THE HUMAN BEAST
DID NOT KILL YOU.

779
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,333
THEY DIDN'T HARM ME.
LISTEN TO HIM.

780
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,417
STOP!

781
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:44,709
STOP, PLEASE!

782
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:51,667
WITH YOUR DEATH,
WE WIN.

783
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:52,959
NOBODY WINS.

784
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:54,917
HAVE ANY MORE OF
YOUR MEN DIED?

785
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,875
WE CAN'T BE KILLED.

786
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:58,875
THERE'S AN ALIEN ABOARD.

787
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:00,583
IT WANTS US ALIVE.

788
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,291
NO DOUBT
YOU WILL REASSEMBLE

789
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:08,166
AFTER I HAVE HACKED
YOU TO BITS!

790
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,500
YOU FOOL.

791
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:50,125
LOOK!

792
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,792
LOOK!

793
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,750
KANG, FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES--

794
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,667
A THOUSAND LIFETIMES--

795
00:45:57,667 --> 00:45:59,458
SENSELESS VIOLENCE,

796
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:00,834
FIGHTING,

797
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:02,458
WHILE A-AN ALIEN

798
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:04,250
HAS TOTAL CONTROL
OVER US.

799
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:21,417
ALL RIGHT.

800
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:25,125
ALL RIGHT.

801
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,125
IN THE HEART.
IN THE HEAD.

802
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,625
I WON'T STAY DEAD.

803
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,917
NEXT TIME I'LL DO
THE SAME TO YOU.
I'LL KILL YOU.

804
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:31,792
AND IT GOES ON AND ON,
THE GOOD OLD GAME
OF WAR,

805
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,959
PAWN AGAINST PAWN!

806
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,458
STOPPING THE BAD GUYS.

807
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:39,166
WHILE SOMEWHERE
SOME...THING

808
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:42,417
SITS BACK AND LAUGHS...

809
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:44,375
AND STARTS IT
ALL OVER AGAIN.

810
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,417
LET'S JUMP HIM.

811
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:51,333
THOSE WHO HATE
AND FIGHT

812
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,458
MUST STOP
THEMSELVES, DOCTOR.

813
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,291
OTHERWISE, IT IS
NOT STOPPED.

814
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:58,458
KANG, I AM YOUR WIFE.

815
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:01,041
I'M A KLINGON.

816
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:03,041
WOULD I LIE FOR THEM?

817
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:04,667
LISTEN TO KIRK.

818
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:06,291
HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.

819
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,417
BE A PAWN, BE A TOY,

820
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:12,417
BE A GOOD SOLDIER THAT
NEVER QUESTIONS ORDERS.

821
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:29,542
KLINGONS KILL
FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES.

822
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:31,291
ALL FIGHTING MUST END,
CAPTAIN,

823
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:32,250
TO WEAKEN THE ALIEN

824
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,375
BEFORE OUR DILITHIUM
CRYSTALS ARE GONE.

825
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:44,792
LIEUTENANT UHURA,

826
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:45,834
Uhura: YES, CAPTAIN?

827
00:47:45,834 --> 00:47:47,041
PUT ME ON SHIPWIDE
INTERCOM.

828
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:48,041
Uhura: AYE, SIR.

829
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:49,875
KANG.

830
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:50,875
Uhura: READY, CAPTAIN.

831
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:55,667
THIS IS CAPTAIN KIRK.

832
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,166
A TRUCE IS ORDERED.

833
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,083
THE FIGHTING IS OVER.

834
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,208
LAY DOWN YOUR WEAPONS.

835
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,333
THIS IS KANG.

836
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:10,250
CEASE HOSTILITIES.

837
00:48:11,792 --> 00:48:12,792
DISARM.

838
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:24,208
THE CESSATION
OF VIOLENCE

839
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,750
APPEARS TO HAVE
WEAKENED IT,
CAPTAIN.

840
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,333
I SUGGEST
THAT GOOD SPIRITS

841
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:29,834
MIGHT MAKE
AN EFFECTIVE WEAPON.

842
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:43,291
GET OFF MY SHIP!

843
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:44,375
YOU'RE A DEAD DUCK HERE.

844
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:46,041
YOU'RE POWERLESS.
WE KNOW ABOUT YOU.

845
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:50,000

WANT TO PLAY.

00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,959
MAYBE THERE ARE OTHERS
LIKE YOU AROUND.

848
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:56,792
MAYBE YOU'VE CAUSED
A LOT OF SUFFERING,

849
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:59,834
A LOT OF HISTORY,
BUT THAT'S ALL OVER.
