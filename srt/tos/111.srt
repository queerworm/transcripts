1
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,574
Welcome to Starbase
11, Captain.

2
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,326
The Commodore is
waiting to see you,

3
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,327
and he's curious why

4
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,121
you suddenly changed course
and came here.

5
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,460
We received a subspace message
asking us

6
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,836
to divert here immediately.

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,797
This base sent no message,
Captain.

8
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,473
You know, Jim, I just
can't understand this.

9
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,933
Mr. Spock received
a transmission

10
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:00,351
from this starbase.

11
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,687
A message from the former
commander of the<i> Enterprise,</i>

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,854
Fleet Captain Pike,

13
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,523
urgently requesting
that we divert here.

14
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:06,691
Impossible.

15
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:07,900
If my First Officer states

16
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:09,485
that he received
a transmission...

17A
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,404
Jim, I'm not doubting
anyone's word.

17B
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,404
Jose, I...

18
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,030
I'm simply telling
you it's impossible.

19
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,031
        Why?

20
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,825
You don't know?

21
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:16,992
You actually
don't know

22
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,661
what's happened
to Captain Pike?

23
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:21,164
There's been subspace chatter
about it for months.

24
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:25,418
I'm sorry to have to be the one
to show you.

25
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,295
He's upstairs in
the medical section.

26
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,765
You ever met
Chris Pike?

27
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,017
We met when he was promoted
to Fleet Captain.

28
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,019
About your age,

29
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,438
a big handsome man,
vital, active.

30
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:46,981
I took over the<i> Enterprise</i>
from him,

31
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:48,899
and Spock served with him
for several years.

32
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,152
11 years, four months,
five days.

33
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,154
What's his problem, Commodore?

34
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,072
Inspection tour
of a cadet vessel,

35
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,491
old class-J starship.

36
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,826
One of the baffle
plates ruptured.

37
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:02,955
The delta-rays?

38
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,709
He went in, bringing
out all those kids

39
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,085
that were still alive.

40
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,338
Just wanted you gentlemen
to be prepared.

41
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,724
MENDEZ:
Captain Pike?

42
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:25,145
(<i> motorized whir </i>)

43
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,920
Captain, you remember
these gentlemen.

44
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,838
They wanted to visit you.

45
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,383
(<i> two beeps </i>)

46
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,427
Two flashes mean no.

47
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,059
I thought you might make
an exception for them.

48
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:08,103
(<i> two beeps </i>)

49
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,855
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

50
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,568
Chris, if there's anything
I can do for you...

51
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,404
(<i> two tone </i>)

52
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:20,283
                Captain Pike,

53
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,159
may I remain
for a moment?

54
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,828
(<i> single tone </i>)

55
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,969
You know why I've come, Captain.

56
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,181
It's only six days away
at maximum warp,

57
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,891
and I have it well planned.

58
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,478
(<i> two beeps </i>)

59
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,322
I have never disobeyed
your orders before, Captain...

60
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,407
but this time, I must.

61
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,742
(<i> two beeps </i>)

62
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,201
I know.

63
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,536
I know it is treachery,

64
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,996
and it's mutiny.

65
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:11,626
But I must do this.

66
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,878
(<i> two beeps </i>)

67
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:16,005
I have no choice.

68
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:18,633
(<i> two beeps </i>)

69
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:31,354
<i>Space-- the final frontier.</i>

70
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:35,816
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship </i>Enterprise.

71
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,112
<i>Its five-year mission--</i>
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

72
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:44,825
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

73
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:49,246
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no man has gone before.</i>

74
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,332
(<i> theme song playing </i>)

75
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,037
Once more, Jose.

76
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,207
Spock stated he received
a message for us to come here.

77
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,459
He entered same in his log.

78
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,876
That's all the proof I require.

79
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,879
And what do those
record tapes show?

80
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,673
No message
sent from here.

81
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:43,133
No message received
by your vessel.

82
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,845
Then I suggest the record tapes
have been deliberately changed.

83
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,054
                    Oh.

84
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,515
A computer expert can change
record tapes, duplicate voices,

85
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,558
say anything, say nothing.

86
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,226
The fact remains that
your First Officer's

87
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:53,519
former captain
is hospitalized,

88
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,729
horribly injured
at this base,

89
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,564
and that same First Officer
seems to be the only one

90
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,023
who heard that message
ordering you here.

91
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,442
If he had wanted
to see Captain Pike,

92
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,693
he could have requested
a leave.

93
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:01,694
I would have granted it!

94
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:02,862
Well, that's
true, of course!

95
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,245
Who would want
to divert us here?

96
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:12,747
There's no trouble

97
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,666
in the space sector
we're patrolling now,

98
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,793
no alien problems.

99
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,882
Computer Center.

100
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:25,259
Chief Humbolt here, sir.

101
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:26,469
MENDEZ:
Have you rechecked

102
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,345
all the record tapes
on the date in question?

103
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,597
Yes, sir.

104
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,891
Is there any way at all
a message could have been sent

105
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,267
from here without us knowing it?

106
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,477
Negative, Commodore.

107
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,771
We've checked and double-checked
everything possible.

108
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,938
All right.

109
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,273
Start checking the impossible.

110
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:41,275
Mendez out.

111
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:43,653
(<i> whirring and beeping </i>)

112
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,653
Oh, have I introduced
Miss Piper, Jim?

113
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,862
Uh-uh.

114
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,238
This is Captain
Kirk, Miss Piper.

115
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,658
I recognized the Captain
immediately.

116
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,577
A mutual friend
described you, sir.

117
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,119
Lieutenant
Helen Johannson?

118
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,706
Helen described...

119
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,916
She merely mentioned
she knew you, sir.

120
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,335
(<i> quietly </i>):
Oh.

121
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,631
You have something
to report, Miss Piper.

122
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,966
Oh, yes, sir.

123
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,300
I'm afraid

124
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:50,970
our investigation turned up
very little, Commodore.

125
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,597
There is, of course,

126
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,182
Mr. Spock's years of service
with Captain Pike,

127
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:56,517
indications of his
extreme loyalty

128
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,643
to this former
commander...

129
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,520
Miss Piper, a Vulcan can
no sooner be disloyal

130
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,980
than he can exist
without breathing.

131
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,397
That goes
for his present commander

132
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,566
as well as his past.

133
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,110
We're forced to consider
every possibility, sir.

134
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:07,319
We can be certain

135
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:09,446
Captain Pike could not
have sent a message.

136
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,615
In his condition,

137
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,616
he's under
observation

138
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,867
every minute
of every day.

139
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,535
And totally unable to move, Jim.

140
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,370
His wheelchair
is constructed

141
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:18,330
to respond to
his brain waves.

142
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,791
Oh, he can turn it,
move it forwards

143
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,793
or backward slightly...

144
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,379
With a flashing light,
he can say yes or no.

145
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:27,507
MENDEZ:
But that's it, Jim.

146
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,884
That's as much as
that poor devil can do.

147
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,888
His mind is as active
as yours and mine,

148
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,055
but it's trapped

149
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,432
inside a useless,
vegetating body.

150
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,811
He's kept alive mechanically,

151
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,022
a battery-driven heart.

152
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,232
Then there's no way
he could even have asked

153
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:47,317
for that message to be sent?

00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,946
UHURA:
Repeat,<i> Enterprise </i>to Starbase.

181
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,405
Orders received.

182
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,992
We need operating confirmation
from the ship's captain.

183
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,954
Come in, Starbase.

184
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:23,623
Come in, Captain Kirk.

185
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,751
KIRK:
This is Captain Kirk.

186
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,628
You have confirmation,
Miss Uhura.

187
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,671
Hansen here, Captain.

188
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,506
Our destination
has been scramble-fed

189
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:33,674
into ship's computers.

190
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,509
Uh, how can I handle the helm

191
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:37,594
if I don't know
where we're going?

192
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:40,514
KIRK:
Mr. Spock is with me here.

193
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:41,849
He'll answer all questions.

194
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,600
Kirk out.

195
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,191
This is Mr. Spock.

196
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,193
The ship's computers
will handle the helm

197
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,611
on this voyage, Mr. Hansen.

198
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,239
Course will be computed
and set automatically.

199
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,324
You will not discuss this
with ship's crew

200
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,785
or Starbase personnel.

201
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,036
Do you read?

202
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,495
Acknowledged, sir.

203
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:04,705
Stand by.

204
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,041
We'll warp out of orbit
in one hour.

205
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,219
(<i> two beeps </i>)

206
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,638
(<i> two beeps </i>)

207
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,936
He keeps blinking "no".

208
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,938
"No" to what?

209
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,773
I've tried
questioning him.

210
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,108
He's almost agitated himself
into a coma.

211
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,443
How long will he live?

212
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:37,112
As long as any of us.

213
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,281
Blast medicine anyway.

214
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,450
We've learned to tie
into every human organ

215
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,286
in the body except
one: the brain.

216
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,789
The brain is what
life is all about.

217
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,292
Now, that man can think
any thought that we can,

218
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:54,797
and love, hope, dream
as much as we can...

219
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,468
but he can't reach out,
and no one can reach in.

220
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,971
He keeps blinking "no".

221
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,098
"No" to what?

222
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,100
They could question him
for days, weeks,

223
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,936
before they stumble
on the right thing.

224
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,272
                Bones...

225
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,943
could this have anything
to do with Spock?

226
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,278
I don't read you
at all, Jim.

227
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,615
What I mean is...

228
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:24,869
either a message
was received...

229
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,962
It was one of two things.

230
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,672
Either someone sent a message
diverting us here,

231
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,300
or someone on board the ship
lied about receiving it.

232
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,469
Could that someone be Mr. Spock?

233
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:44,972
Jim, forgetting how well
we both know Spock,

234
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,141
the simple fact
that he's a Vulcan

235
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,476
means he's incapable
of telling a lie.

236
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,312
He is also half-human.

237
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,482
And that half
is completely submerged.

238
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:59,319
To be caught acting like us
or even thinking like us

239
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,654
would completely
embarrass him.

240
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:03,032
Someone's interfering with
my command and my ship!

241
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,992
I don't know who it is,
but I mean to find out.

242
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,076
                Even you!

243
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,577
If I thought you had
the technical know-how,

244
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,454
I'd suspect you, but
you don't-- Spock does!

245
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,915
He would not make
a false entry...

246
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,332
There's a false entry
in the log right now

247
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,834
which doesn't jibe with
the established facts.

248
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,835
How do you explain that?

249
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,753
I can't, but to question Spock,

250
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,547
of all people? Me, yes.

251
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,424
I could run off half-cocked,
given a good reason.

252
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,592
So could you, but not Spock.

253
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,053
It's impossible.

254
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,931
COMMUNICATOR:
Dr. McCoy,
report to Transporter Control.

255
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,933
Dr. McCoy
to Transporter Control.

256
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,434
McCoy here.

257
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:32,436
You're needed
aboard the<i> Enterprise, </i>Doctor.

258
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,603
Medical emergency.

259
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,771
Well, what is it?

260
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,274
Sickness, injury? How bad is it?

261
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:40,694
That's all we have on it,
Doctor: Just "needed aboard".

262
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,199
(<i> sighs </i>)

263
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:50,454
Probably somebody
discovered a hangnail.

264
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:54,374
I'll beam up
and let you know, Jim.

265
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,550
"For Eyes Of Starfleet Command
Only."

266
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:07,554
Oh, I'm certifying
I ordered you to read it.

267
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:11,308
Know anything at all
about this planet?

268
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,477
KIRK:
What every ship captain knows.

269
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,729
General Order Seven:
"No vessel under any condition,

270
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:18,148
emergency or otherwise,
is to visit Talos IV."

271
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,151
And to do so is the only
death penalty left on our books.

272
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,070
Only Fleet Command
knows why.

273
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,155
Not even this file
explains that.

274
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,079
But it does name
the only Earth ship

275
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,331
that ever visited
the planet.

276
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:41,005
The<i> Enterprise.</i>

277
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,092
Commanded
by Captain Christopher Pike.

278
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,178
MENDEZ:
With a half-Vulcan
Science Officer named Spock.

279
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,680
Commodore!

280
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,892
Captain Pike-- he's gone!

281
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,105
Mendez here. What is it?

282
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,940
MAN:
Starship<i> Enterprise, </i>Commodore.

283
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,441
It's warping out of orbit.

284
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,818
Refuses to acknowledge
our signal.

285
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:20,210
Out of orbit,
Mr. Spock.

286
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,379
Seems strange with
no navigator on duty.

287
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:25,340
The<i> Enterprise </i>knows
where she's going, Mr. Hansen.

288
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,555
Someone's trying
to hail us, sir.

289
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,308
Maintain radio silence,
Lieutenant.

290
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,397
This is First Officer Spock.

291
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,732
Per Starfleet orders
this date,

292
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,486
I have been placed in temporary
command of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

293
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,949
While our destination is secret,

294
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,159
our mission
is relatively simple.

295
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,955
SPOCK:
Starbase Command has assigned
Captain Kirk medical rest leave

296
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,081
until our return.

297
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,332
His instructions are

298
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,210
that you will obey my orders
as you would his.

299
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,503
    First Officer out.

300
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,838
What's going on
around here?

301
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:06,798
Who said Jim needed
a medical rest leave?

302
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:09,468
And this call about me being
needed aboard the ship?

303
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,469
I've checked everywhere...

304
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,304
And no one from the ship
made such a call.

305
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:13,305
That's right.

306
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:14,306
SPOCK:
Doctor, I regret

307
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:15,890
they elected to keep
certain things from you.

308
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,434
Will you come with me, please?

309
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:36,036
What is this, Spock?

310
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,205
Captain, are you all right?

311
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,873
I see that you're
still signaling "no".

312
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,875
Doctor,
one moment, please.

313
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:42,709
(<i> two beeps </i>)

314
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,587
(<i> two beeps </i>)

315
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,256
(<i> single beep </i>)

316
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,009
Kirk to Dr. McCoy.

317
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,635
I'm recording you
this message, Bones,

318
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:53,220
so there'll be
no misunderstanding.

319
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,680
I'm sorry to have to make it
an order.

320
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,225
You are not to disturb
Captain Pike with any questions.

321
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,684
Simply take good care of him.

322
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,895
Follow Spock's instructions
to the letter.

323
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:03,272
Kirk out.

324
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,026
(<i> two beeps </i>)

325
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,986
(<i> two beeps </i>)

326
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,707
Sir, scanners report
an object following us

327
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,252
about the size of a
Starbase shuttlecraft.

328
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,549
Shall we reverse helm?

329
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,967
Take no action,
Mr. Hansen.

330
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,223
But at our speed,
they'll never catch us.

331
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,059
But in case they
want to reach us...

332
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,727
You have your orders,
Mr. Hansen.

333
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,480
We'll make no contact.

334
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,843
Starbase<i> Shuttlecraft One</i>
to<i> Enterprise.</i>

335
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,261
Come in, please.

336
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:20,682
<i>Enterprise, </i>Commodore Mendez
and Captain Kirk.

337
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:24,686
If you read me,
you are ordered to reply.

338
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,356
Repeating it on all
emergency frequencies, Jim.

339
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,692
Spock is headed for
Talos IV, all right.

340
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:33,027
Pulling ahead of us fast.

341
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,698
Fuel is down to 63.3.

342
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:39,201
If we turn back now,
we've just got barely enough

343
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,537
to get us back to the base.

344
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,040

356
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,001
Computed.

357
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:33,922
<i>Shuttlecraft </i>is already past
point of safe return.

358

00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:59,906
(<i> humming winding down </i>)

360
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,370

361
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,706
Blast you anyway.

362
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:11,376
You had no right to come along.

363
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,711
R.H.I.P., Captain.

364
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,629
"Rank hath its privileges".

365
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,929
Two hours of oxygen left.

366
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:25,224
Wonderful.

367
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,891
Part of me is hoping
that the<i> Enterprise</i>

368
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,892
won't come back for us.

369
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,061
We step on that deck,
Spock is finished,

370
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:32,105
court-martialed, disgraced.

371
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:36,818
He's dead... if he makes it
to Talos IV.

372
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,073
Why would he want
to get Pike there?

373
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,576
The Command report stated
Talos contained

374
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:46,578
absolutely no practical
benefits to mankind.

375
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:49,080
Spock would have some logical
reason for going there.

376
00:20:49,163 --> 00:20:50,582
Maybe.

377
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:52,501
Maybe he's just gone mad.

378
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,057
I keep wondering who might be
after us in a shuttlecraft,

379
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,060
and I keep coming up
with the same answers,

380
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:15,064
but I can't be right,
can I, Mr. Spock?

381
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:20,404
Computer control, lock onto
shuttlecraft following us.

382
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,072

385
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,498

Doctor, as senior

00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,204
I present myself
to you for arrest.

401
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:12,205
    What?!

402
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:15,750
The charge is
mutiny, Doctor.

403
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,087
I never received orders
to take command.

404

405
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,101
Doctor...

406
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,398
Mr. Spock is, um...
under arrest.

407
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,775
Is confinement
to quarters enough?

408
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,068
Adequate, Doctor.

409
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:43,820
I'll make no trouble.

410
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,031
(<i> sighs </i>)

411
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,575
Well, confine him.

412
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,118
                    Yes, sir.

423
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:22,901
His quarters?

(<i> bosun's whistle sounds </i>)

425
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,236

Reverse power.
Hold this position.

429
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,076
Tell whoever gave those orders
to report...

430
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,745
Sir, there's nobody up there
giving orders.

431
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:36,748
Mr. Spock has the computers
running the ship.

432
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:38,750
Disengage computer control,
Uhura.

433
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,251
We can't disengage, Captain.

434
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:42,253

00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:02,959
Mr. Spock...

463
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:05,253
you are aware of your right
to counsel of your choice?

464
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,589
Sir, I waive counsel.

465
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,716
Further,
I waive rights to this hearing

466
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,676
and request
immediate court-martial.

467
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,553
Request denied.

468
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,014
May I inquire
on what grounds, Captain?

469
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,059
Mutiny requires a trial board

470
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,771
of no less than three
command officers.

471
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,273
Since there are only two
of that rank available...

472
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:26,691
Sir, I must point out

473
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,443
that there are three officers
of command rank available--

474
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:33,865
yourself, Commodore Mendez,
and Captain Christopher Pike.

475
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:35,449
Denied.

476
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,410
Captain Pike
is a complete invalid.

477
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:39,078
I believe you'll find

478
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,956
he's still on
the active duty list.

479
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:45,669
We didn't have the heart
to retire him, Jim.

480
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,086
He's got you.

481
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,547
Whatever he's up to,
he's planned it well.

486
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:14,739
Mr. Spock, are you aware
in pleading guilty

487
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,533
that a further charge,
involving the death penalty,

488
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,868
must be held against you

489
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,412
should this vessel
enter the Talos Star Group?

490
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:22,664
I am.

491
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,458
                            Why?

492
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:28,086
        What does it accomplish
        to go there

493
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,629
or to take Captain Pike there?

494
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,840
            I want to know why.

495
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,176
Are your comments
a part of the record, sir?

496
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:37,011
Yes, it's on

497
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,304

499
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,808
For what purpose?

500
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,518
To comply with the request
you just made, sir--

501
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,605
that I explain the importance
of going to Talos IV.

502
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,358
By asking him why,
you've opened the door

503
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:52,902
to any evidence
he may wish to present.

504
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,279
Apparently what
he had in mind.

505
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,281
Present your evidence.

506
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,616

Mr. Spock, no vessel

517

makes record tapes
in that detail, that perfect.

518
00:27:59,093 --> 00:28:00,261
What were we watching?

519
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,430
I cannot tell you at this time,
sir.

520
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:06,142
Captain Pike, were
any record tapes of this nature

521
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:08,019
made during your voyage?

522
00:28:08,102 --> 00:28:12,065
(<i> two beeps, then two more </i>)

523
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,818
The court
is not obliged to view evidence

524
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,736
without knowing its source.

525
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,948
Unless the court asks
a prisoner why, Commodore.

526
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,783
You did ask that question.

527
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,285
You mean I was maneuvered
into asking.

528
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:26,370
Your evidence is out of order.

529
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,663
I am forced to contest that,
Commodore.

530
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,664
I want to see more.

531
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,208
You have that right, Captain.

532
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,877
But just because the prisoner
is your first officer

533
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,337
and your personal friend...

534
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,255
That has nothing to do with it.

535
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,174
Very well; continue.

536
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:41,010
Screen on, Mr. Scott.

537
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,345
(<i> high-pitched alarm tones </i>)

538
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:43,805
Now, there's something
out there.

539
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,348
There's still
something out there.

540
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:47,266
SPOCK:
As I stated, gentlemen,

541
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,143
this was 13 years ago.

542
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,812
We were on routine patrol

543
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,939
when the ship's sensors
detected something ahead.

544
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,316
At first, we were not certain
what it was.

545
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:56,943
...coming
at the speed of light.

546
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,361
Collision course.

547
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:04,283
(<i> high-pitched alarm tones </i>)

548
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,582
The meteorite beam
has not deflected it, Captain.

549
00:29:11,665 --> 00:29:12,792
Evasive maneuvers, sir?

550
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,543
Steady as we go.

551
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,766
It's a radio wave, sir.

552
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,769
We're passing through
an old-style distress signal.

553
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:34,022
They were keyed
to cause interference

554
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,775
and attract attention this way.

555
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,068
A ship in trouble
making a forced landing, sir.

556
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,070
That's it; no other message.

557
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,321
I have a fix.

558
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,490
It comes from
the Talos Star Group.

559
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:46,450
We've no ships or Earth
colonies that far out.

560
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,662
Their call letters check
with a survey expedition.

561
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:50,830
SS<i> Columbia.</i>

562
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,331
Disappeared in that region

563
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,833
approximately 18 years ago.

564
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,959
It would take that long

565
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,170
for a radio beam
to travel from there to here.

566
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,714
Records show the Talos Group
has never been explored.

567
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,801
Solar system similar to Earth.

568
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,093
SPOCK:
11 planets.

569
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,387
Number four seems to be...

570
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,516
Class-M... oxygen atmosphere.

571
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,728
Then they could still be alive,
even after 18 years.

572
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,605
If they survived the crash.

573
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,400
We aren't going to go...
to be certain?

574
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:22,695
Not without any indication
of survivors, no.

575
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:24,072
Continue on to the Vega Colony

576
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,324
and take care of our own sick
and injured first.

577
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:28,701
You have the helm.

578
00:30:28,784 --> 00:30:30,203
Maintain present course.

579
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,288
CREW WOMAN:
Yes, sir.

580
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,726

581
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:55,228
Royce here.

582
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,146
Drop by my cabin, Doctor.

583
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,362
Ah...

584
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,447
(<i> knock at door </i>)

585
00:31:13,787 --> 00:31:16,415
What's that?

586
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,376
I didn't say
there's anything wrong with me.

587
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:23,172
I understand we, uh,
picked up a distress signal.

588
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,465
That's right.

589
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:28,136
Unless we get
anything more positive on it,

590
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,430
it seems to me the condition
of our own crew takes precedent.

591
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,100
I'd like to log the ship's
doctor's opinion, too.

592
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,852
Oh, I concur
with yours, definitely.

593
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,106
You know, good, I'm glad you do,

594
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,483
'cause we're going to stop first
at the Vega Colony

595
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,652
and replace anybody
who needs hospitalization.

596
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:46,529
    And also...
                    (<i> clinking </i>)

597
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:49,615
What the devil are you
putting in there, ice?

598
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:52,535
Who wants a
warm martini?

599
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,580
What makes you think
I need one?

600
00:31:56,664 --> 00:32:01,002
Sometimes a man
will tell his bartender things

601
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,837
he'll never tell his doctor.

602
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,134
What's been on
your mind, Chris,

603
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,929
the fight on Rigel VII?

604
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,180
Shouldn't it be?

605
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,099
My only yeoman and two others
dead, seven injured.

606
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,392
Was there anything
you personally

607
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:17,643
could have done
to prevent it?

608
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:18,852
Oh, I should
have smelled trouble

609
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,229
when I saw the swords
and the armor.

610
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,772
Instead of that,
I let myself get trapped

611
00:32:21,855 --> 00:32:22,773
in that deserted fortress

612
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:24,483
and attacked
by one of their warriors.

613
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,361
Chris, you set standards for
yourself no one could meet.

614
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,573
You treat everyone on board like
a human being except yourself.

615
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:33,242
And now you're
tired, and you...

616
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,827
You bet I'm tired.

617
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,955
You bet.

618
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,748
I'm tired of being responsible
for 203 lives,

619
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,334
and I'm tired of deciding

620
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,461
which mission is too risky
and which isn't,

621
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,130
and who's going on the landing
party and who doesn't.

622
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,300
And who lives...

623
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:51,635
and who dies.

624
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,181
Oh, I've had it, Phil.

625
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,517
To the point of finally taking
my advice-- a rest leave?

626
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,145
To the point
of considering resigning.

627
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,440
And do what?

628
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:07,318
Well, for one thing, go home.

629
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:15,243
Nice little town with 50 miles
of parkland around it.

630
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,329
Remember I told you
I had two horses?

631
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:19,705
We used to take some food

632
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:20,873
and ride out all day.

633
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:22,416
Oh, that sounds exciting--

634
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,668
ride out with a picnic lunch
every day.

635
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:28,464
I said that's one place
I might go.

636
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:30,716
Or I'd, I'd go into business
on Regulus

637
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,385
or on the Orion Colony.

638
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,927
You, an Orion trader,

639
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,804
dealing in green
animal women slaves?

640
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,557
The point is that this
isn't the only life available.

641
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,809
There's a whole galaxy
of things to choose from.

642
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,145
                Not for you.

643
00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:47,983
A man either lives life
as it happens to him,

644
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,319
meets it head on and licks it,

645
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,571
or he... turns his back on it

646
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,407
and starts to
wither away.

647
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,452
Now, you're beginning to talk
like a doctor, bartender.

648
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,038
You take your choice.

649
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,416
We both get the same
two kinds of customers:

650
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,501
the living... and the dying.

651

We're intercepting

00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:12,067
                Mr. Spock,

672
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,820
I'm truly amazed
at your technical prowess

673
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:17,030
in somehow
manufacturing all this.

674
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,450
I congratulate you
on your imagination.

675
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:21,910
But this is a court
of Space Law, not a theater.

676
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:26,415
Captain, please tell the court
this is not imagination

677
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,418
nor some clever
photographic record.

678
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,213
Are we seeing the actual events
of 13 years ago?

679
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,173
(<i> single tone </i>)

680
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,511
Yes, gentlemen, on that screen,
as it happened,

681
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,346
the incredible experience

682
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,348
of Captain Christopher Pike
on Talos IV.

683
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,350
If after witnessing this,

684
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,269
the court wishes
to turn this vessel back,

685
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,062
I will release this ship
to manual control.

686
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,399
You're in no position
to bargain.

687
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,858
This is ridiculous.

688
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:54,485
This man mutinied,
stole your ship,

689
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:55,528
abducted Captain Pike.

690
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,363
Well, for me,
this has gone far enough.

691
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,198
We still haven't heard
the full story.

692
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,199
I vote to continue.

693
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,534
And I vote we
do not. Deadlock.

694
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,244
It's not a deadlock.

695
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,997
There's still one member of the
trial board to be heard from.

696
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,040
                    Very well.

00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,251
it's up to you.
