YES, ESPECIALLY
IN VIEW OF THE FACT

175
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,606
THAT THE RECORDS OF THIS
EXPEDITION INDICATE

176
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,985
THAT THEY DID HAVE
SOME FOR BREEDING
AND FOOD PURPOSES.

177
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,529
APPARENTLY,
NONE OF THEM SURVIVED.

178
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,072
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THE MEDICAL
RECORDS

179
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,156
ON THE
EXPEDITION.

180
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,242
YES, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT.

181
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,536
OH, CAPTAIN, I'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

182
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,079
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
OUR FIELDS AND CROPS.

183
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,416
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU
AND THE DOCTOR WHAT
WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED HERE.

184
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,584
OH, I'M AFRAID
I'LL HAVE
TO BOW OUT.

185
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,504
I HAVE TO CONTINUE
WITH THESE MEDICAL
EXAMINATIONS.

186
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,631
HOWEVER, IF I
FIND EVERYONE
ELSE'S HEALTH

187
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,009
TO BE AS PERFECT
AS YOURS, I...

AWAY HIS SHINGLE.

189
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,432
YOU'LL FIND
NO WEAKLINGS HERE.

190
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,891
CAPTAIN.

191
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,477
THIS IS THE REASON,
CAPTAIN.

192
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,522
THIS SOIL WILL GROW
ANYTHING WE PLANT
IN IT.

193
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,981
IT'S A PERFECT
WORLD.

194
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,609
WE HAVE
A MODERATE CLIMATE,

195
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,611
MODERATE RAINS
ALL YEAR ROUND.

196
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,905
IT GIVES US
ALL WE NEED.

197
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,115
IT<i> IS</i> PERFECT.

198
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,033
PARDON ME, CAPTAIN.

199
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,659

200
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,247
I HAVE WORK TO ATTEND
TO MYSELF, CAPTAIN.

201
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,208
GO AHEAD,
LIEUTENANT.

202
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,419
I HEARD SANDOVAL
SAYING THEY COULD
GROW ANYTHING HERE.

203
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,046
THAT'S TRUE, SIR.
THEY'VE GOT A VARIETY
OF CROPS IN.

204
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,047
GRAINS, POTATOES, BEANS.

205
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,341
MAKE YOUR POINT.

206
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,717
WELL, SIR, FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL COLONY,

207
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,096
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE VERY
LITTLE ACREAGE PLANTED.

208
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,056
THERE'S ENOUGH
TO SUSTAIN THE COLONY,

209
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,517
BUT VERY LITTLE MORE.

210
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,019
IT'S LIKE A JIGSAW
PUZZLE ALL ONE COLOR.

211
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,397
NO KEY TO WHERE
THE PIECES FIT IN.

212
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,148
WHY?

213
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,400
[COMMUNICATOR BEEPS]

214
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,109

00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,527

217
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,322

<i>NO, BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO</i>
<i>SEE THIS FOR YOURSELF.</i>

219
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,451
ON MY WAY.

220
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,623
SANDOVAL'S MEDICAL
RECORD FOUR YEARS AGO

221
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,166
WHEN THE EXPEDITION
LEFT EARTH.

222
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,168
HE REGISTERED
SCAR TISSUE ON HIS LUNGS

223
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,086
FROM LOBAR PNEUMONIA
SUFFERED WHEN
HE WAS A CHILD.

224
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,005
NO MAJOR OPERATIONS,

225
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,841
BUT THERE WAS
AN APPENDECTOMY.

226
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,385
RECEIVED ALL REQUIRED
INOCULATIONS, ET CETERA.

227
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,179
WHAT'S SO STRANGE
ABOUT THAT?

228
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,639
NOTHING.

229
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,016
BUT I EXAMINED THAT MAN
NOT MORE THAN TWO HOURS AGO,

230
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,810
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT
HIS READINGS WERE?

231
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,062
PERFECT, PERFECT,
AND PERFECT.

232
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,981
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
I'VE EXAMINED HERE.

233
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,358
INSTRUMENT MALFUNCTION?

234
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,985
NO. I THOUGHT OF THAT,
AND I TESTED IT ON MYSELF.

235
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,613
IT ACCURATELY RECORDED
MY LACK OF TONSILS

236
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,533
AND THOSE TWO BROKEN
RIBS I HAD ONCE.

237
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,619
IT DID NOT RECORD THE SCAR
TISSUE ON SANDOVAL'S LUNGS,

238
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,621
BUT IT DID RECORD
A HEALTHY APPENDIX

239
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,248
WHERE ONE WAS
SUPPOSEDLY REMOVED.

240
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,879
[TRICORDER HUMS]

241
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,090

00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,259
NOT EVEN INSECTS.

243
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,512
YET YOUR PLANTS GROW,

244
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,056
AND YOU'VE
SURVIVED EXPOSURE
TO BERTOLD RAYS.

245
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,559
THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED.

246
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:07,935
PLEASE DO.

247
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,937
LATER.

248
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,649
I HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD
THE FEMALE CAPACITY

249
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,318
TO AVOID A DIRECT
ANSWER TO ANY QUESTION.

250
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,238
AND I NEVER
UNDERSTOOD YOU.

251
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,407
UNTIL NOW.

252
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,034
THERE WAS ALWAYS
A PLACE IN HERE

253
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,743
WHERE NO ONE COULD COME.

254
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,997
THERE WAS ONLY THE FACE
YOU ALLOW PEOPLE TO SEE.

255
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,251
ONLY ONE SIDE
YOU'D ALLOW THEM TO KNOW.

256

259
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,892
LOGICALLY,
YOU SHOULD ALL BE DEAD.

260
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,520
IF I TELL YOU
HOW WE SURVIVE,

261
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,522
WILL YOU TRY
TO UNDERSTAND

262
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,898
HOW WE FEEL ABOUT
OUR LIFE HERE?

263
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,650

00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,689
TO EVACUATE ALL PERSONNEL
FROM THIS COLONY.

273
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,609
NATURALLY,
YOU'LL INFORM YOUR PEOPLE
TO BEGIN PREPARATIONS.

274
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,696
WE WILL HAVE
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR YOU
ABOARD THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

NO.

276
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,036
UH, IT'S NOT AN ARBITRARY
DECISION ON MY PART, SIR.

277
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,456
I HAVE MY ORDERS.

278
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,417

UNNECESSARY.

WE'RE IN NO DANGER HERE.

280
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,506
WE'VE EXPLAINED

AND
THEIR EFFECT.

282
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,550
CAN'T YOU
UNDERSTAND?

283
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:06,095
DOCTOR, HOW CAN
I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND?

284
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,474
YOUR OWN INSTRUMENTS
HAVE SHOWN THAT WE'RE
ALL IN PERFECT HEALTH.

285
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,225
WE'VE HAD NO DEATHS HERE.

286
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,811
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR ANIMALS?

287
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,937
WE'RE VEGETARIANS.

288
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,524
THAT DOESN'T ANSWER
MY QUESTION, SIR.

289
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,776
WHY DID ALL
YOUR ANIMALS DIE?

290
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:25,031
CAPTAIN, YOU STRESS
VERY UNIMPORTANT MATTERS.

291
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,161
WE WILL NOT LEAVE.

292
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,006
IT'S NOT MUCH FURTHER.

293
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,468
YOU'VE NOT YET
EXPLAINED THE NATURE
OF THIS THING.

294
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,471
ITS BASIC PROPERTIES
AND ELEMENTS ARE
NOT IMPORTANT.

295
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:53,142
WHAT IS IMPORTANT
IS IT GIVES LIFE,
PEACE, LOVE.

296
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,103
WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING

297
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,064
WAS ONCE KNOWN
IN THE VERNACULAR

298
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,483
AS A HAPPINESS PILL.

299
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,360
AND YOU,
AS A SCIENTIST,

300
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,904
SHOULD KNOW THAT
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

301
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,113
COME.

302
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,327

307
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,735
NO, I CAN'T.

NOT LIKE THIS,
IT DIDN'T HURT US.

I AM NOT LIKE YOU.

311
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,476

THERE'S NO NEED TO HIDE
YOUR INNER FACE ANY LONGER.

00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,653

00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,406
COMPLETE HEALTH
AND PEACE OF MIND.

520
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,409
THAT'S PARADISE?

521
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,120
WE HAVE NO NEED
OR WANT, CAPTAIN.

522
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,747
IT'S A TRUE EDEN, JIM.

523
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,874
THERE IS BELONGING...

524
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,126
AND LOVE.

525
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,795
NO WANTS. NO NEEDS.

526
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,758
WE WEREN'T MEANT
FOR THAT. NONE OF US.

527
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,094
MAN STAGNATES
IF HE HAS NO AMBITION,

528
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,221
NO DESIRE TO BE
MORE THAN HE IS.

529
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,390
WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED.

530
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,600
EXCEPT A CHALLENGE.

531
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,395
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, JIM,

532
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,607
BUT YOU'LL COME AROUND...
SOONER OR LATER.

533
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,776
JOIN US.

534
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,653
PLEASE.

535
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,200
I'M GOING BACK
TO THE SHIP.

536
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,665
ENGINEERING? SCOTTY?

537
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,379
BIOCHEMISTRY LAB?

538
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,756
SECURITY?

539
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,676
IS THERE ANYONE
ON BOARD?

540
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,511
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

541
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:50,080
CAPTAIN'S LOG.
STARDATE 3417.7.

542
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,294
EXCEPT FOR MYSELF,

543
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,338
ALL CREW PERSONNEL
HAVE TRANSPORTED

544
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,091
TO THE SURFACE
OF THE PLANET.

545
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,342
MUTINIED.

546
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,139
LIEUTENANT UHURA
HAS EFFECTIVELY SABOTAGED

547
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,807
THE COMMUNICATIONS
STATION.

548
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:14,396
I CAN ONLY CONTACT
THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET.

549
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,483
THE SHIP...

550
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,612
CAN BE MAINTAINED
IN ORBIT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS,

551
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,071
BUT EVEN WITH
AUTOMATIC CONTROLS,

552
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,282
I CANNOT PILOT HER ALONE.

553
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:32,956
IN EFFECT,
I AM MAROONED HERE.

554
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,722
I'M BEGINNING
TO REALIZE...

555
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,187
JUST HOW BIG THIS SHIP
REALLY IS, HOW QUIET.

556
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:59,817
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GET MY CREW BACK,

557
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,111
HOW TO COUNTERACT
THE EFFECT OF THE SPORES.

558
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,450
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I CAN OFFER

559
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,618
AGAINST...

560
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,373
PARADISE.

561
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,658
<i>ENTERPRISE</i>
TO MR. SPOCK.

562
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,368
YES, JIM.
WHAT IS IT NOW?

563
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,580
I'VE JOINED YOU.
I UNDERSTAND NOW.

564
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,668
WONDERFUL, JIM.
WHEN WILL YOU
BEAM DOWN?

565
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,337
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
IN MY QUARTERS
I WANT TO PACK.

566
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:06,383
GOOD. LAYLA AND I
WILL MEET YOU AT
THE BEAMDOWN POINT.

567
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,719
<i>KIRK OUT.</i>

568
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,791
NO.

569
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,466
NO!

570
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,011
I...

571
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,555
CAN'T...

572
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,934
LEAVE!

573
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,899
EMOTIONS.

574
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,571
VIOLENT EMOTIONS.

575
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:52,531
NEEDS.

576
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,869
ANGER.

577
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,303
CAPTAIN'S LOG--SUPPLEMENTAL.

578
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,933
I THINK I'VE
DISCOVERED THE ANSWER...

579
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,603
BUT TO CARRY OUT MY PLAN
ENTAILS CONSIDERABLE RISK.

580
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:28,191
MR. SPOCK IS
MUCH STRONGER THAN
THE ORDINARY HUMAN BEING.

581
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,570
AROUSED, HIS GREAT
PHYSICAL STRENGTH
COULD KILL.

582
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,241
BUT IT'S A RISK
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE.

583
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:39,452
ENTERPRISE<i> TO MR. SPOCK.</i>

584
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,453
SPOCK HERE.

585
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,747
<i>IT'S JIM.</i>

586
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,249
WHAT'S KEEPING
YOU, JIM?
WE'VE BEEN WAITING.

587
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,209
I'VE BEEN PACKING
SOME THINGS,

588
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,628
AND I REALIZE THERE'S
SOME EQUIPMENT HERE

589
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,006
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE
DOWN AT THE SETTLEMENT.

590
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,382
<i>YOU KNOW WE CAN'T</i>
<i>COME BACK ON BOARD</i>

591
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,761
<i>ONCE THE LAST</i>
<i>OF US HAS LEFT.</i>

592
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,554
DO YOU WANT ME
TO BEAM UP A PARTY?

593
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,182
NO. I THINK
YOU AND I CAN HANDLE IT.

594
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,976
WHY DON'T YOU
BEAM UP NOW?

595
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,186
JUST A MOMENT.

596
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,815
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.
DO YOU MIND?

597
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,609
I'LL WAIT.

598
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,492
READY TO BEAM UP, JIM.

599
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,997
ENERGIZING.

600
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:35,801
ALL RIGHT,
YOU MUTINOUS, DISLOYAL,
COMPUTERIZED HALF-BREED,

601
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,303
WE'LL SEE ABOUT YOU
DESERTING MY SHIP.

602
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:43,809
THE TERM HALF-BREED
IS SOMEWHAT APPLICABLE,

603
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,561
BUT COMPUTERIZED
IS INACCURATE.

604
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,314
A MACHINE CAN BE
COMPUTERIZED, NOT A MAN.

605
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,316
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU'RE A MAN?

606
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,776
YOU'RE AN OVERGROWN
JACK RABBIT,

607
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,612
AN ELF WITH
A HYPERACTIVE THYROID.

608
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,031
JIM,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND--

609
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,074
OF COURSE
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

610
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,325
YOU DON'T HAVE THE BRAINS
TO UNDERSTAND.

611
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,828
ALL YOU HAVE
IS PRINTED CIRCUITS.

612
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,956
CAPTAIN, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME--

613
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:10,251
WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT
FROM A SIMPERING,
DEVIL-EARED FREAK

614
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,171
WHOSE FATHER WAS
A COMPUTER AND
HIS MOTHER AN ENCYCLOPEDIA?

615
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,048
MY MOTHER WAS A TEACHER.

616
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,591
MY FATHER,
AN AMBASSADOR.

617
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:20,595
YOUR FATHER WAS
A COMPUTER LIKE HIS SON.

618
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,099
AN AMBASSADOR FROM
A PLANET OF TRAITORS.

619
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,852
THE VULCAN NEVER LIVED
WHO HAD AN OUNCE
OF INTEGRITY.

620
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:28,436
CAPTAIN, PLEASE DON'T--

621
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,856
YOU'RE A TRAITOR
FROM A RACE OF TRAITORS.

622
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,231
DISLOYAL TO THE CORE,

623
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,776
ROTTEN LIKE THE REST
OF YOUR SUBHUMAN RACE,

624
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:40,866
AND YOU'VE GOT THE GALL
TO MAKE LOVE TO THAT GIRL.

625
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,952
THAT'S ENOUGH.

626
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:46,830
DOES SHE KNOW
WHAT SHE'S GETTING, SPOCK?

627
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,166
A CARCASS FULL
OF MEMORY BANKS

628
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,584
WHO SHOULD BE
SQUATTING IN A MUSHROOM

629
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,462
INSTEAD OF
PASSING HIMSELF
OFF AS A MAN?

630
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,882
YOU BELONG
IN A CIRCUS, SPOCK,

631
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,758
NOT A STARSHIP...

632
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:03,055
RIGHT NEXT
TO THE DOG-FACED BOY.

633
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,626
HAD ENOUGH?

634
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,130
I DIDN'T REALIZE
WHAT IT TOOK

635
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,883
TO GET UNDER
THAT THICK HIDE OF YOURS.

636
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,219
ANYHOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SO MAD ABOUT.

637
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,096
IT ISN'T EVERY
FIRST OFFICER

638
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:47,599
WHO GETS TO BELT
HIS CAPTAIN...
SEVERAL TIMES.

639
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,479
YOU DID THAT TO ME
DELIBERATELY.

640
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:57,275
BELIEVE ME, MR. SPOCK,
IT WAS PAINFUL...

641
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,111
IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.

642
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:01,029
THE SPORES.

643
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,572
THEY'RE GONE.

644
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,577
I DON'T BELONG
ANYMORE.

645
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,080
YOU SAID THEY WERE
BENEVOLENT AND PEACEFUL.

646
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,290
VIOLENT EMOTIONS
OVERWHELM THEM,
DESTROY THEM.

647
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,168
I HAD TO MAKE YOU
ANGRY ENOUGH

648
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,795
TO SHAKE OFF
THEIR INFLUENCE.

649
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,090
THAT'S THE ANSWER,
MR. SPOCK.

650
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,968
THAT MAY BE CORRECT,
CAPTAIN,

651
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:24,844
BUT TRYING
TO INITIATE A BRAWL

652
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,431
WITH OVER 500 CREWMEN
AND COLONISTS IS
HARDLY LOGICAL.

653
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,433
I HAD SOMETHING ELSE
IN MIND.

654
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,604
CAN YOU PUT TOGETHER
A SUBSONIC TRANSMITTER--

655
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,064
SOMETHING WE CAN HOOK INTO
THE COMMUNICATIONS STATION

656
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:40,068
AND BROADCAST OVER
THE COMMUNICATOR?

657
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,319
IT CAN BE DONE.

658
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,571
GOOD.
LET'S GET TO WORK.

659
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,614
CAPTAIN.

660
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,662
STRIKING
A FELLOW OFFICER

661
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,206
IS A COURT-MARTIAL
OFFENSE.

662
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,751
WELL, IF WE'RE BOTH
IN THE BRIG,

663
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,421
WHO'S GOING TO BUILD
THE SUBSONIC TRANSMITTER?

664
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,301
THAT IS QUITE
LOGICAL, CAPTAIN.

665
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,393
WELL, NOW, IT'S
A LITTLE EARLY

666
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,272
TO BE COUNTING STARS,
MISS LAYLA.

667
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,607
I'M WAITING
FOR MR. SPOCK
AND THE CAPTAIN

668
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,151
TO TRANSPORT DOWN.

669
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,486
THEY HAD SOME
EQUIPMENT TO BE MOVED.

670
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,530
BUT IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

671
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:26,614
I WISH HE'D COME BACK.

672
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,994
WELL, NOW, I THINK
I CAN FIX THAT FOR YOU.

673
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,787
<i>ENTERPRISE?</i>

674
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,497
<i>[BEEP BEEP]</i>

675
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,546
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i> SPOCK HERE.

676
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,347
THIS IS LAYLA.

677
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,808
I BORROWED
THE DOCTOR'S COMMUNICATOR.

678
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,687
I WAS WORRIED SOMETHING
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU.

679
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,690
<i>YOU ARE ALL RIGHT,</i>
<i>AREN'T YOU?</i>

680
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,525
YES.

681
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,652
YES. I'M...I'M QUITE WELL.

682
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,656
CAN I COME ABOARD?

683
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,326
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A STARSHIP BEFORE,

684
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,037
<i>AND I WANT</i>
<i>TO TALK TO YOU.</i>

685
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,248
ARE YOU STILL
AT THE BEAMDOWN POINT,

686
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:19,376
AND IS THE DOCTOR THERE?

687
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,627
YES TO BOTH QUESTIONS.

688
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,673
GIVE YOUR COMMUNICATOR
BACK TO DR. McCOY.

689
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,093
YOU WON'T NEED IT
TO BEAM UP.

690
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:31,596
IT'LL TAKE A FEW MOMENTS.
JUST WAIT THERE.

691
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,598
OUT.

692
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,141
MR. SPOCK...

693
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,608
MISS COLOMI IS STRICTLY
YOUR CONCERN, BUT...

694
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,903
SHOULD YOU TALK TO HER
WHILE SHE'S STILL

695
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,572
UNDER THE INFLUENCE
OF THE SPORES?

696
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,535
I'LL BE BACK
SHORTLY, CAPTAIN.

697
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:37,662
YOU'RE NO LONGER
WITH US, ARE YOU?

698
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,041
I FELT SOMETHING
WAS WRONG.

699
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,877
IT WAS NECESSARY.

700
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,424
COME BACK TO
THE PLANET WITH ME.

701
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,384
YOU CAN BELONG AGAIN.

702
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,637
OH, COME BACK
WITH ME, PLEASE.

703
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,100
I CAN'T.

704
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,736
I LOVE YOU.

705
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,573
I SAID THAT
SIX YEARS AGO,

706
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,203
AND I CAN'T SEEM TO STOP
REPEATING MYSELF.

707
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:23,541
ON EARTH, YOU COULDN'T
GIVE ANYTHING OF YOURSELF.

708
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,878
YOU COULDN'T EVEN
PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME.

709
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,132
WE COULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TOGETHER THERE.

710
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,260
WE COULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TOGETHER
ANYPLACE ELSE.

711
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,472
BUT WE'RE HAPPY HERE.

712
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:42,185
I CAN'T LOSE YOU NOW,
MR. SPOCK. I CAN'T.

713
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,562
I HAVE
A RESPONSIBILITY...

714
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,191
TO THIS SHIP...

715
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:52,529
TO THAT MAN
ON THE BRIDGE.

716
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,950
I AM WHAT I AM, LAYLA...

717
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,914
AND IF THERE ARE
SELF-MADE PURGATORIES,

718
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,167
THEN WE ALL HAVE
TO LIVE IN THEM.

719
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,588
MINE CAN BE NO WORSE
THAN SOMEONE ELSE'S.

720
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,593
I HAVE LOST YOU,
HAVEN'T I?

721
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:24,977
NOT ONLY YOU,
I'VE LOST ALL OF IT.

722
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,106
THE SPORES...

723
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,691
I'VE LOST THEM, TOO.

724
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:35,780
THE CAPTAIN DISCOVERED
THAT STRONG EMOTIONS
AND NEEDS

725
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,615
DESTROY THE SPORE
INFLUENCE.

726
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,578
AND THIS IS FOR MY GOOD?

727
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:50,378
DO YOU MIND IF I SAY
I STILL LOVE YOU?

728
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:03,891
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
IF YOU HAD ANOTHER
NAME, MR. SPOCK.

729
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,987
YOU COULDN'T
PRONOUNCE IT.

730
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,458
THEY'LL NOT HEAR THIS,
OF COURSE.

731
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,876
IT'LL BE MORE
A SENSATION OF FEELING IT.

732
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,920
AS THOUGH SOMEBODY
HAD PUT ITCHING
POWDER

733
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:33,963
ON THEIR SKIN.

734
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,006
PRECISELY.

735
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:39,885
IT SHOULD BEGIN
TO WORK ON THEIR NERVES
IN A FEW MINUTES.

736
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,641
[HIGH-PITCHED HUM]

737
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:50,396
SORRY, DeSALLE.

738
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,773
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

739
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,317
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

740
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,692
MORE LIKE YOU'RE CLUMSY.

741
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,946
IF YOU HADN'T
GOTTEN IN MY WAY...

742
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,245
OOH!

743
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:17,798
COME ON. BREAK IT UP.
BREAK IT UP.

744
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:34,273
WELL, DOCTOR,
I'VE BEEN THINKING

745
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,652
ABOUT WHAT SORT OF WORK
I COULD ASSIGN YOU TO.

746
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:40,863
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT SORT OF WORK?
I'M A DOCTOR.

747
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,031
NOT ANYMORE, OF COURSE.

748
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,200
WE DON'T NEED YOU...
NOT AS A DOCTOR.

749
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,910
OH, NO?

750
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:53,876
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
JUST HOW FAST I CAN PUT
YOU IN A HOSPITAL?

751
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,003
I AM THE LEADER
OF THIS COLONY.

752
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,838
I'LL ASSIGN YOU
TO WHATEVER WORK
I THINK IS SUITABLE.

753
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,882
JUST A MINUTE.

754
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,595
YOU'D BETTER MAKE ME
A MECHANIC.

755
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,848
THEN I CAN TREAT
LITTLE TIN GODS LIKE YOU.

756
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,528
SORRY, SANDOVAL.

757
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:25,575
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MADE ME DO THAT.

758
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,581
WE'VE DONE
NOTHING HERE.

759
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,336
NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS,
NO PROGRESS.

760
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,173
THREE YEARS WASTED.

761
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:46,554
WE WANTED TO MAKE
THIS PLANET A GARDEN.

762
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:51,559
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.

763
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,353
YOU CAN'T SURVIVE
WITHOUT THE SPORES.

764
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:59,150
AFTER YOU'VE CLEARED
AT THE STARBASE,

765
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:02,403
YOU COULD BE RELOCATED.

766
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,114
IT DEPENDS UPON
WHAT YOU WANT.

767
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,532
I THINK I'D...

768
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,455
I THINK WE'D LIKE TO
GET SOME WORK DONE.

769
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,708
THE WORK WE STARTED
OUT TO DO.

770
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:19,712
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>

771
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:22,298
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>
SPOCK HERE.

772
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:26,218
THIS IS McCOY. SANDOVAL
WOULD LIKE TO TALK
TO THE CAPTAIN.

773
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,970
JUST A MOMENT.

774
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,181
THEY'RE ALL BEGINNING
TO CALL IN, CAPTAIN.

775
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:31,432
RATHER CONTRITELY,
I SHOULD SAY.

776
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,434
SANDOVAL WISHES
TO SPEAK TO YOU.

777
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,395
PUT HIM ON THE SPEAKER.
KIRK HERE.

778
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,732
OH, CAPTAIN, AS
I UNDERSTOOD IT,

779
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,652
YOU WERE TO
TRANSPORT US
TO STARBASE 27.

780
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,903
WE'LL GIVE YOU
EVERY COOPERATION.

781
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,616
START MAKING
PREPARATIONS,
MR. SANDOVAL.

782
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,661
WE'LL BEGIN TRANSPORTING
YOUR PEOPLE ABOARD

783
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:55,414
AS SOON AS MORE
OF OUR CREW CHECKS IN.

784
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,847
WELL, JIM,
I'VE JUST EXAMINED

785
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,348
THE LAST
OF THE COLONISTS,

786
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,852
AND THEY'RE ALL
IN ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,
PERFECT HEALTH.

787
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:19,522
A FRINGE BENEFIT
LEFT OVER BY THE SPORES.

788
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,566
GOOD.

789
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,696
WELL, THAT'S
THE SECOND TIME

790
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,240
MAN'S BEEN THROWN
OUT OF PARADISE.

791
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,451
NO, NO, BONES.
THIS TIME WE WALKED
OUT ON OUR OWN.

792
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:36,831
MAYBE WE WEREN'T
MEANT FOR PARADISE.

793
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,250
MAYBE WE WERE MEANT
TO FIGHT OUR WAY THROUGH--

794
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,794
STRUGGLE,
CLAW OUR WAY UP,

795
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,797
SCRATCH FOR EVERY INCH
OF THE WAY.

796
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:48,509
MAYBE WE CAN'T STROLL
TO THE MUSIC OF THE LUTE.

797
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:52,555
WE MUST MARCH
TO THE SOUND OF DRUMS.

798
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,014
POETRY, CAPTAIN.

799
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,307
NONREGULATION.

800
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,934
WE HAVEN'T HEARD
MUCH FROM YOU

801
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,480
ABOUT OMICRON CETI 3,
MR. SPOCK.

802
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:04,650
I HAVE LITTLE TO SAY
ABOUT IT, CAPTAIN,

803
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:10,782
EXCEPT THAT FOR
THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE...

804
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:12,700
I WAS HAPPY.
