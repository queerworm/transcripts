CHILDREN, CAPTAIN,
LOTS OF THEM.

189
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,720
WE COULDN'T BEGIN
TO GET CLOSE TO THEM.

190
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,139
THEY JUST SEEMED
TO SCURRY AWAY...

191
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,599
LIKE ANIMALS.

192
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,308
ONLY CHILDREN.

193
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,893
MIRI SAID
ALL THE ADULTS DIED.

194
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,272
THAT CREATURE
WHICH ATTACKED US
WAS CERTAINLY NO CHILD.

195
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,024
PERHAPS IT DIED
OF THE DISEASE

196
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,152
THE GIRL'S
TALKING ABOUT.

197
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,154
THERE MUST BE
RECORDS SOMEWHERE...

198
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,991
AND ANSWERS TO SOME
OF OUR QUESTIONS.

199
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,702
MIRI...

200
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,664
DO YOU
KNOW ANY BUILDINGS

201
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,707
WHERE THE DOCTORS
USED TO WORK?

202
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,334
YES, I KNOW THAT.

203
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,419
THEM AND THEIR PILLS
AND THINGS.

204
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,086
WILL YOU
TAKE ME THERE?

205
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,879
THAT'S A BAD PLACE.

206
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,590
IT'S IMPORTANT.

207
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,551
PLEASE?

208
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,928
ALL RIGHT.

209
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,685
DO YOU HAVE A NAME, TOO?

210
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,144
YES.

211
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,270
IT'S JIM.

212
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,189
I LIKE THAT NAME.

213
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,774
GOOD.

214
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,151
I LIKE YOURS, TOO.

215
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,236
I LIKE YOU.

216
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,698
DO YOU REALLY?

217
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:28,242
I WOULDN'T LIE
TO YOU.

218
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,329
I WOULDN'T LIE
TO YOU EITHER, JIM.

219
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,583
I REMEMBER THE GRUPS,
BUT YOU'RE NICE.

220
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,711
YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

221
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,589
WHY, THANK YOU.

222
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,971
IT'S ALREADY STARTING.

223
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,724
I KNEW IT WOULD.

224
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,476
JUST LIKE IT DID
WITH THE GRUPS.

225
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,854
IT'LL SPREAD ALL OVER YOU,
AND YOU'LL YELL.

226
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,439
YOU'LL TRY
TO HURT EVERYBODY.
THEN YOU'LL DIE.

227
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,526
I KNEW IT WOULD!
I KNEW IT WOULD!

228
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,917
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 2713.6.

229
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,336
THE BUILDING
MIRI LED US TO

230
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,130
ALSO HOUSED AN AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION STATION,

231
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,549
WHICH SENT OUT
THE SIGNALS

232
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,925
THAT DREW US
TO THIS PLANET.

233
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,177
WE ALSO DISCOVERED
SOMETHING ELSE--

234
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,763
THAT THE BLUE SPLOTCHES

235
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,222
CHARACTERISTIC
OF THE UNKNOWN DISEASE

236
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,141
HAD APPEARED
ON EACH OF US,

237
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,977
WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF MR. SPOCK.

238
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,731
THERE WAS A WELL-EQUIPPED
LABORATORY IN THE BUILDING.

239
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,733
DR. McCOY TOOK TISSUE SAMPLES
OF EACH OF US

240
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,903
IN AN ATTEMPT TO ISOLATE
THE ORGANISM RESPONSIBLE.

241
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,782
A VERITABLE
ZOO OF BACTERIA.

242
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,744
BEAM DOWN
A BIOCOMPUTER

243
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,662
AND A PORTABLE
ELECTRONIC MICROSCOPE.

244
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,872
IF I'M GOING TO BE
DEALING WITH VIRUSES,

245
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,249
I'M GOING TO NEED
BETTER EQUIPMENT
THAN I HAVE HERE.

246
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,085
YES, DOCTOR.
CAPTAIN KIRK.

247
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,128
YES, LIEUTENANT?

248
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,170
I'VE GOT VOLUNTEERS
STANDING BY

249
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,171
READY TO HELP YOU, SIR.

250
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,674
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES

251
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,050
DO I WANT ANYONE
TO BEAM DOWN FROM THE SHIP.

252
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,136
WE CAN'T TAKE
ANY CHANCES WITH
FURTHER CONTAMINATION.

253
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,764
BUT, CAPTAIN,
IF YOU BECOME TOO ILL--

254
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:13,807
MY ORDERS STILL STAND,
LIEUTENANT.

255
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,934
YOU CAN HELP US BEST BY
CLEARING THE COMPUTER BANKS

256
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,977
AND STANDING BY.
KIRK OUT.

257
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,315
BONES.

258
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,733
HMM?

259
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,192
WHY DO YOU THINK

260
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,154
THE SYMPTOMS
HAVEN'T APPEARED
IN MR. SPOCK?

261
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,449
I DON'T KNOW.

262
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,952
PROBABLY THE LITTLE BUGS
OR WHATEVER THEY ARE
HAVE NO APPETITE

263
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,203
FOR GREEN BLOOD.

264
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,749
BEING
A RED-BLOODED HUMAN

265
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:43,169
OBVIOUSLY HAS
ITS DISADVANTAGES.

266
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,923
THERE YOU HAVE
A MUSEUM PIECE, DOCTOR.

267
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,134
LENS TYPE--
MANUALLY OPERATED,
LIGHT-ACTIVATED.

268
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,137
SPARE ME THE ANALYSIS,
MR. SPOCK, PLEASE.

269
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,389
IT IS ENOUGH
THAT IT WORKS.

270
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,648
IT SPREADS
REAL FAST. I KNOW.

271
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,484
WHEN YOU'RE OLD,
IT COVERS YOU
LIKE ANYTHING.

279
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,147
DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH LUCK, DID THEY?

CAPTAIN'S LOG.

281
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,780
DR. McCOY'S BIOCOMPUTER

282
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,908
AND A PORTABLE
ELECTRONIC MICROSCOPE

283
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,367
HAVE BEEN BEAMED DOWN
FROM THE ENTERPRISE.

284
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,619
THEY WILL BE
USED IN CONJUNCTION

285
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,705
WITH COMPUTER BANKS
ON-BOARD SHIP.

286

EXTREME MULTIPLICABILITY.

287

FOR NUCLEIC ACIDS...

288
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,173
THIS WAS
300 YEARS AGO, CAPTAIN.

289
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,052
ALL THE ADULTS ARE DEAD.

290
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,930
ONLY THE CHILDREN
ARE LEFT ALIVE.

291
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,849
BUT CHILDREN
BECOME ADULTS.

292
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:23,185
AT LEAST...
THEY HAVE UP TO NOW.

293
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,030
DOCTOR?

294
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,909
THERE ARE CERTAIN
GLANDULAR CHANGES

295
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,160
WHICH TAKE PLACE
UPON ENTERING PUBERTY,

296
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,161
ARE THERE NOT?

297
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,122
OF COURSE.

298
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,374
IT CHANGES THE ENTIRE
BODY SYSTEM.

299
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,292
YOU KNOW THAT.

300
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,712
OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT.
WHY?

301
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:54,759
IS IT NOT POSSIBLE
THAT THESE CHILDREN HERE,

302
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,511
AS THEY ENTER PUBERTY,
CONTRACT THE DISEASE?

303
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,138
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN

304
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,099
WHY THERE ARE
NO ADULTS.

305
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,268

306
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,104
POSTPUBESCENT.

307
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,897
IT COULD BE.

308
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,067
IT'S ILLOGICAL.

309
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,902
IT DOES NOT FOLLOW.

310
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,362
ALL THE ADULTS
ON THIS PLANET DIED

311
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,740
300 YEARS AGO,

312
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,285
BUT THERE ARE CHILDREN
IN THE STREETS.

313
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,705
WHO DIE WHEN THEY
ENTER ADOLESCENCE.

314
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,835
BUT...HOW DO THEY
KEEP THE LINE GOING?

315
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,462
ONE THING, CAPTAIN.

316
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,673
IF SHE WERE
A WILD ANIMAL

317
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,508
EVER SINCE SHE'S
BEEN A LITTLE GIRL,

318
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,010
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

319
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,469
THAT SHE WANTS
TO STAY WITH US?

320
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,387
LONELINESS.
I DON'T KNOW.
CURIOSITY.

321
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,931
I THINK
CHILDREN HAVE
AN INSTINCTIVE NEED

322
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,016
FOR ADULTS.

323
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,268
THEY WANT TO BE TOLD
RIGHT AND WRONG.

324
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,480
THERE MAY BE
OTHER EMOTIONS AT WORK

325
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,356
IN THIS CASE, CAPTAIN.

326
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:54,568
[McCOY]
SHE LIKES YOU, JIM.

327
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,864
SHE'S BECOMING
A WOMAN.

328
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,377

HEY...CLEAN UP THAT DESK
FOR ME, WILL YOU?

342
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,635
ALL RIGHT, JIM.

343
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,767
ACCORDING TO THEIR
LIFE PROLONGATION PLAN,

344
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,351
WHAT THEY THOUGHT
THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHING,

345
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,562
A PERSON WOULD
AGE ONLY ONE MONTH

346
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,481
FOR EVERY 100 YEARS

347
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,986
100 YEARS
AND ONLY ONE MONTH?

348
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,240
EXACTLY, YEOMAN.

349
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,951
EVIDENTLY THROUGH
SOME MISCALCULATION,

350
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,745
THIS VIRUS ANNIHILATED
THE ENTIRE ADULT POPULATION

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,705
IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD,

352
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,415
LEAVING
ONLY THE CHILDREN.

353
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,417
BUT THAT MEANS
THESE CHILDREN...

354
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,963
COULD VERY WELL
BE IMMENSELY OLD.

355
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,464

ANSWER THE QUESTION

00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,133
OF WHAT HAPPENED
TO THEIR PARENTS.

357
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:41,175

IN A FEW MONTHS.

535
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,024
IN ADDITION, THE DISEASE
IS WORKING ON EACH OF US

536
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,902
ACCORDING
TO DR. McCOY'S PREDICTION.

537
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,195
OUR TEMPERS
ARE GROWING SHORT.

538
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,740
AND WE'RE NO FURTHER ALONG
THAN WE WERE TWO DAYS AGO.

539
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,157
HAVEN'T YOU FOUND
A THING YET?

540
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,660
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TAKE A CRACK AT IT?

541
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,382
[GLASS BREAKS]

542
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,760
NO!

543
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,930
NO!

544
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,348
NO!

545
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,449
I'M UPSET, CAPTAIN,

546
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,367
SO UPSET.

547
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,208
BACK ON THE SHIP,

548
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,545
I USED TO TRY TO GET YOU
TO LOOK AT MY LEGS.

549
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,719
CAPTAIN...

550
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,681
LOOK AT MY LEGS.

551
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:03,375
WE'RE ALL FRIGHTENED.

552
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,010
[McCOY]
JIM, I FOUND
SOMETHING!

553
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,977
THE LAST SLIDE
I EXAMINED,

554
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,562
I FAILED TO MAKE
THE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENT.

555
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:24,479
THE SLOWING DOWN
OF MY OWN RESPONSES--

556
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,772
NEVER MIND THAT,
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

557
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:29,275
THE DISEASE--
THE ONE THEY CREATED
300 YEARS AGO.

558
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:29,902
THERE'S
A CHANCE!

559
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,904
A CHANCE.

560
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:33,321
AT LEAST
IT'S A RACE NOW,

561
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,909
AND WE'VE JUST
WASTED A MINUTE.

562
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,553
THAT WOULD BE
SOME FOOLIE, MIRI,

563
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:57,763
BUT DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD WORK?

564
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,932
I KNOW. I KNOW.

565
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:02,225
DON'T YOU THINK
I'VE HEARD THEM TALK?

566
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,352
THEY HAVE
SUCH LITTLE TIME

567
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,730
TO DO THIS DUMB THING
OF THEIRS--

568
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,356
THIS BANINSKI THING.

569
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,983
IF WE GET HER AWAY--

570
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,526
THAT YEOMAN--

571
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,696
THAT'S ONE PERSON LESS
TO START OFF WITH.

572
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,990
BUT HOW, MIRI,
IF THEY'RE SO BUSY,

573
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,242
IF THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
THE BIG EMERGENCY,

574
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,036
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO GET HER AWAY?

575
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,370
IT'S EASY.

576
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,748
SHE'S ALWAYS ASKING ME
ABOUT THE YOUNGEST ONLIES--

577
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:25,749
THE LITTLE ONES.

578
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,085
"WHAT IF THEY GET SICK,
WHO TAKES CARE OF THEM?

579
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,045
"DO THEY HAVE ENOUGH
TO EAT?

580
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,463
WHERE DO THEY SLEEP?"

581
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:32,380
I'LL JUST TELL HER

582
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,634
ONE OF YOU FELL DOWN
AND GOT HURT.

583
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:36,969
ME. SAY IT'S ME.

584
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,595
ALL RIGHT. YOU.

585
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,347
BUT GRUPS--
THEY KNOW THINGS
AND ALL THAT.

586
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,517
YOU KNOW, I BET THEY'LL
BE ABLE TO DO IT

587
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,769
WITH ONE PERSON LESS.

588
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,437
NOT ONE--

589
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,731
TWO.

590
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,942
BECAUSE HE'LL TRY
TO FIND HER.

591
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,193
WHO?
WHO WILL, MIRI?

592
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,697
THE CAPTAIN.

593
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,951
HE'LL TRY TO FIND HER,
BUT HE WON'T...

594
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,411

595
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,497

ON THE HEAD.

IT HAS TO BE.

611
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,777
YEAH, BUT THE QUESTION
IS--WHAT'S THE DOSAGE?

612
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,362
HMM.

613
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,073
THAT IS A VERY GOOD
QUESTION.

614
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,783
WHERE IS SHE, MIRI?

615
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,035
WHERE IS SHE, MIRI?
WHERE'S JANICE?

616
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,161
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

617
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,537
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

618
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,791
WHERE IS SHE?

619
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,003
HAS SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HER?

620
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,213
DON'T YOU FEEL
ALL RIGHT?

621
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,716
NO, I DON'T
FEEL ALL RIGHT!

WHAT'S GOING ON?

ANYTHING TO HAPPEN
TO YOU.

625
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,646

626
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,272
THAT'S NOT ALL, CAPTAIN.

627
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,858
WE'VE GOT TO FIND
THOSE COMMUNICATORS.

628

WE'RE TRYING, MR. SPOCK.
WE'RE TRYING VERY HARD.

629

THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!

630
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:19,779
THIS COULD BE IT,

631
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:23,992
BUT WE CAN'T TEST IT
WITHOUT THE SHIP'S
COMPUTERS.

632
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,577
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE
THOSE COMMUNICATORS, JIM.

633
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,662
THIS IS THE VACCINE?

634
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,708
THAT'S WHAT
THE COMPUTERS
WILL TELL US.

635
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:37,214
WITHOUT THEM,
IT COULD BE A BEAKER
FULL OF DEATH.

636
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,350

637
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,978

A FEW HOURS LEFT.

641
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,659

SOMETHING.

YOU, YOUR FRIENDS,

00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:15,585
ARE GOING
TO GET THE DISEASE

UNLESS WE SUCCEED
IN WHAT WE'RE DOING.

645

YOUR FRIENDS GET IT.

646

SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS.

647
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,553
NOT SOMETIMES.
ALL THE TIMES, MIRI!

648
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,389
AS SOON AS YOU
START GROWING UP

649
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,682
THE WAY YOU ARE...

650
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,562
DON'T YOU KNOW

651
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:40,235
WHY YOU DON'T LIKE
TO PLAY GAMES ANYMORE,

652
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,445
WHY YOU DON'T
SEE YOUR FRIENDS
THE WAY YOU USED TO?

653
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,617
IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE BECOMING
A YOUNG WOMAN...

654
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:53,748
AND THE MOMENT YOU
BECOME A YOUNG WOMAN,

655
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,792
YOU GET THE DISEASE--
ALL OF YOU.

656
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,877
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IT JUST HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

657
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,587
ALL THE TIME, MIRI!

658
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,007
IT'S HAPPENING TO YOU
RIGHT NOW!

659
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,176
LOOK AT IT!

660
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,969
LOOK AT IT, MIRI,
IT'S IN YOU!

661
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:06,761
NO!

662
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,430
NO!

663
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,349
NO!

664
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,316
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!

665
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,110
NO, YOU GOT THE WRONG GAME--

00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,529
A TEACHER,
I TOLD YOU!

667
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:27,573
NOW, WHAT DOES
A TEACHER SAY, HUH?

668
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,618
YEAH.

669
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,788

OR BUNK BUNK,
BAD KID.

671
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,758
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

672
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,135
IT'S A FOOLIE.

673
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,511
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH ME?

674
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,348
YOU THINK I'D TELL YOU?

00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,018
[DOOR OPENS]

676
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,563
MIRI.

677
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,773
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

678
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,400
I KNOW.

679
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,693
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
SOMETHING GO WRONG?

680
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,362
NO.

681
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,863
OK, THEN.

682
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,074
JUST DON'T STAND THERE
IN THE DOORWAY.
COME ON IN.

683
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,041
LISTEN TO HIM.

684
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,085
YOU LISTEN, MIRI.

685
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,171
I DID.
WHY DO YOU THINK
I BROUGHT HIM HERE?

686
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,005
TELL THEM, JIM.

687
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,882
"TELL THEM, JIM."

688
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,342
"TELL THEM, JIM."

00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,410
THIS ISN'T A GAME.

708
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,619
IT NEVER WAS A GAME.

709

00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,044
I GOT TWO JOBS.
BUNK BUNK!

714
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,421
[CHILDREN]
BLAH BLAH BLAH!

715
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,798
BLAH BLAH BLAH!

716
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,008
BLAH BLAH BLAH!

717
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,219
LISTEN TO ME!

718
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:12,762
YOU'VE GOT
OUR COMMUNICATORS--

719
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,433
THE BOXES WE TALK INTO.

720
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,393
WE NEED THEM
TO TALK TO THE SHIP.

721
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,061
BLAH BLAH BLAH!

722
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,815
NO BLAH BLAH BLAH!

723
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:28,569
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T
TALK TO THE SHIP,

724
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,614
IF YOU DON'T HELP US...

725
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,243
THERE WON'T BE
ANY GAMES ANYMORE.

726
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:38,413
THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING...

727
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,958
NOTHING--

728
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,085
NO GRUPS, NO ONLIES,

729
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,629
NOBODY LEFT...

730
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,508
FOREVER AND EVER.

731
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,597
CAPTAIN.

732
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,647
NOW, LISTEN TO ME.

733
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,525
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP US
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

734
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,319
LET JANICE GO.

735
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,653
GIVE ME
THOSE COMMUNICATORS

736
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,865
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

♪ NYAH YAH YAH-YAH YAH ♪

738
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,997

742
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,008
YOU'VE SEEN YOUR FRIENDS

743
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,177
CHANGE ONE BY ONE

744
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,137
AS THEY GREW UP.

745
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,556
DID YOU EVER SEE
ONE OF THEM NOT CHANGE?

746
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,183
ONE BY ONE,
THEY GOT THE DISEASE,

747
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,893
AND THEY BECAME LIKE--

748
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,896
LIKE THOSE CREATURES
YOU'RE AFRAID OF--

749
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:45,688
LIKE LOUISE.

750
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,274
ONE BY ONE THEY CHANGED
AND GOT THE DISEASE.

751
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,776
THE DISEASE LIKE I'VE GOT,
LIKE MIRI HAS.

752
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,611
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

753
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:53,821
YOU'RE NOT BABIES.

754
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,990
WE CAN HELP YOU!

755
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:56,991
BUNK BUNK!

756
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,035
BUNK BUNK!

757
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,328
BUNK BUNK!

758
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,038
NO, PLEASE. NO!

759
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,925
IT'S WAITING FOR YOU.

760
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,510
IT MAY BE ONLY
A MATTER OF MONTHS.

761
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,429
LISTEN TO HIM.
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

762
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:21,682
HE'S FUNNY.
HE THINKS HE'S FUNNY.

763
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,893
BUNK BUNK!
GET HIM!

764
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,811
LOOK AT MY ARMS!

765
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,064
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO YOU...

766
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,941
UNLESS YOU LET ME HELP YOU.

767
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,734
BUNK BUNK!

768
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,069
BUNK BUNK!

769
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,363
AND THE LITTLE ONES...

770
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,826
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO THEM AFTER YOU'VE GONE,

771
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,496
AFTER YOU'VE TURNED
INTO CREATURES LIKE LOUISE?

772
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,124
THEY'LL STILL BE HERE,
BUT NOT FOR LONG,

773
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,000
BECAUSE THE FOOD'S
ALL GONE.

774
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,377
YOU'VE EATEN IT.

775
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,962
MAYBE SIX MONTHS LEFT,
THAT'S ALL,

776
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,465
AND THEN NOTHING LEFT
TO EAT,

777
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:56,884
NOBODY LEFT
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

778
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,553
THEY'LL DIE, TOO.

779
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,973
LOOK AT MY ARM, JAHN.
IT'S HAPPENING TO ME.

780
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:02,932
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

781
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,976
THEY'RE GRUPS!

782
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:05,935
BUNK BUNK!

783
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,979
BUNK BUNK!

784
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:08,938
BUNK BUNK!

785
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,107
BUNK BUNK!

786
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:11,941
ALL RIGHT,
YOU WANT A FOOLIE?

787
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,818
ALL RIGHT.

788
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,445
I DARE YOU.

789
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,616
I DOUBLE-DARE YOU.

790
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,161
LOOK AT THE BLOOD
ON MY FACE.
NOW LOOK AT YOUR HANDS.

791
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,746
BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS.

792
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:26,956
NOW WHO'S DOING
THE HURTING?

793
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,000
NOT THE GRUPS.

794
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,044
IT'S YOU HURTING, YELLING,
MAYBE KILLING,

795
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,630
JUST LIKE THE GRUPS
YOU REMEMBER

796
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,047
AND CREATURES
YOU'RE AFRAID OF.

797
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,424
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE THEM,

798
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,218
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE
JUST LIKE THEM

799
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,180
UNLESS YOU
LET ME HELP YOU.

800
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,183
I'M A GRUP.

801
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:49,020
AND I WANT TO HELP YOU.

802
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,229
I'M BEGGING YOU.

803
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,607
LET ME HELP YOU,

804
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:56,152
OR THERE WON'T BE
ANYTHING LEFT AT ALL.

805
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,739
PLEASE.

806
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,955
WE CAN'T WAIT
FOR THOSE COMMUNICATORS
ANY LONGER.

807
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,791
WE MUST. THE VACCINE
COULD BE FATAL.

808
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,377
THE DISEASE
CERTAINLY IS.

809
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:14,795
HOW LONG
DO WE HAVE LEFT--
HOURS, MINUTES?

810
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,965
HOW MUCH LONGER
DO YOU WANT TO WAIT?

811
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:21,594
BICKERING IS POINTLESS.

812
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:24,597
I'LL CHECK ON
THE CAPTAIN'S PROGRESS.

813
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,770
SPOCK!

814
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:34,041
IS HE DEAD, MR. SPOCK?

815
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,460
NOT YET.

816
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,178
3 HOURS,
11 MINUTES LEFT.

817
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,597
THANK YOU,
LIEUTENANT.

818
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,348
KEEP THIS CHANNEL OPEN.
CLEAR YOUR COMPUTERS.

819
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:00,485
WHAT HAPPENED TO McCOY?

820
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,445
HE INJECTED HIMSELF
WITH THE VACCINE.

821
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,862
HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS
WHEN I FOUND HIM.

822
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,826
LOOK AT HIS FACE.

823
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,294
THE BLEMISHES ARE FADING.

824
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,590
[SPOCK]
THEY'RE FADING.

825
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,955
I NEVER WILL UNDERSTAND
THE MEDICAL MIND.

826
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:10,555
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE
A GOOD THING, MIRI?

827
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,599
OF COURSE IT IS.

828
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:24,777
THEY WERE JUST CHILDREN.

829
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:27,655
SIMPLY
TO LEAVE THEM THERE
WITH A MEDICAL TEAM--

830
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,698
JUST CHILDREN--

831
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,491
300 YEARS OLD AND MORE.

832
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,869
I'VE ALREADY CONTACTED
SPACE CENTRAL.

833
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,412
THEY'LL SEND
TEACHERS, ADVISERS.

834
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,121
AND TRUANT OFFICERS,
I PRESUME.

835
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:36,789
THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

836
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:39,958
MIRI--

837
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,587
SHE REALLY LOVED YOU,
YOU KNOW.

838
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,173
YES.

839
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,763
I NEVER GET INVOLVED
WITH OLDER WOMEN, YEOMAN.

840
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,269
MR. SPOCK?

841
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,978
CAPTAIN?

842
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,898
FULL AHEAD.
WARP FACTOR 1.

843
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,859
WARP FACTOR 1, CAPTAIN.
