174
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,346
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO TAKE YOU OFF THE CASE

175
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,930
AND TURN IT OVER
TO DR. COLEMAN.

176
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,265
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

177
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,602
ON THIS SHIP, MY MEDICAL
AUTHORITY IS FINAL.

178
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,729
IF DR. COLEMAN WANTS TO ASSUME
THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY,
LET HIM DO IT.

179
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,357
I WON'T ALLOW IT.
IT'S DONE.

180
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,028
DR. COLEMAN, YOUR PATIENT.

181
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,823
UH... UH...

182
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,035
DR. COLEMAN, DIDN'T YOU
SUGGEST A SEDATION
TO REST THE PATIENT?

183
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,744
YES, CAPTAIN.
IT'S NOT NECESSARY,
JIM.

184
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,455
CAN'T YOU SEE SHE'S
COMING AROUND?

185

[MOANING]

186
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,715
DR. COLEMAN?

187
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,136
NURSE, ADMINISTER
THE SEDATIVE.

188
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,681
A SEDATIVE IS NOT
WISE AT THIS TIME,
CAPTAIN.

189
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,516
NURSE CHAPEL,
YOU HAVE YOUR ORDERS.

190
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,311
NURSE CHAPEL,

191
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,770
FOLLOW
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.

192
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,411
OH...

193
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,996
AM I...
REALLY LOSING

194
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,999

THE "ENTERPRISE"?

195
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,501
NO.

196
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,003
OH, NO. BAD DREAM.

197
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,505
OH,
BAD DREAM.

198
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,939
Kirk's voice: JAMES KIRK IS
RETURNING TO CONSCIOUSNESS

199
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,941
IN THE BODY OF JANICE LESTER.

200
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,569
THE "ENTERPRISE" IS PROCEEDING
TO ITS NEXT MISSION

201
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,280
ON THE COURSE SET FOR IT
BEFORE I TOOK OVER COMMAND.

202
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,491
NOW THE YEARS I SPENT
STUDYING EVERY SINGLE DETAIL

203
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,327
OF THE SHIP'S OPERATION
WILL BE TESTED.

204
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,204
WITH A LITTLE EXPERIENCE,

205
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,248
I WILL BE INVULNERABLE
TO SUSPICION.

206
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,678
Kirk's voice: AT LAST I ATTAINED
WHAT IS MY JUST DUE--

207
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,722
COMMAND OF A STARSHIP,

208
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,891
ALL THE MONTHS OF PREPARATION
NOW COME TO FRUITION.

209
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,444
COURSE, MR. CHEKOV?

211
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,326
MR. SULU, SET SPEED
AT WARP FACTOR 2.

212
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,662
WARP FACTOR 2,
SIR.

213
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,789
[INDISTINCT RADIO COMMUNICATIONS
IN BACKGROUND]

214
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,225
MR. CHEKOV,

215
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,894
PLOT A COURSE FOR
THE BENECIA COLONY.

216
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,064
DIRECT COURSE
TO BENECIA--
373 MARK 8.

217
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,651
HOW LONG TO THE COLONY
AT OUR PRESENT SPEED?

218
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,778
48 HOURS, SIR.

219
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,405
MR. SULU, SET COURSE
FOR THE COLONY--

220
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,906
373 MARK 8.

221
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,283
AYE, SIR.

222
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,910
373 MARK 8.

223
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,372
CAPTAIN, THAT WILL DELAY
OUR WORK AT BETA AURIGAE.

224
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,832
IT MEANS
REVERSING COURSE.

225
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,083
YES, IT CAN'T BE HELPED.
WE MUST TAKE DR. LESTER

226
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,418
TO A PLACE WHERE SHE
CAN BE TREATED.

227
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,919
MAY I POINT OUT
THAT STARBASE TWO

228
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,214
IS ON THE DIRECT ROUTE
TO OUR DESTINATION?

229
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,677
HOW LONG TO STARBASE TWO?

230
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,595
72 HOURS, CAPTAIN.

231
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,055
THAT'S 24 HOURS TOO LONG.

232
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,266
DR. LESTER'S CONDITION
IS INCREASINGLY SERIOUS.

233
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,476
CONTINUE PRESENT COURSE.

234
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,978
AYE, SIR.

235
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,606
SIR, IF THE DIAGNOSIS
OF DR. LESTER'S ILLNESS

236
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,358
IS THE CRITICAL PROBLEM,

237
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,236
THEN THE BENECIA COLONY
IS DEFINITELY NOT
THE PLACE FOR HER.

238
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,946
THEIR MEDICAL FACILITIES
ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE.

239
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,031
THEY WILL HAVE TO SERVE.

240
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,450
STARBASE TWO
IS FULLY EQUIPPED

241
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,828
AND STAFFED
WITH THE NECESSARY
SPECIALISTS

242
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,832
TO DETERMINE EXACTLY
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THE DOCTOR.

243
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,501
IS THAT NOT CRUCIAL
TO YOUR DECISION?

244
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,878
THANK YOU, MR. SPOCK,

245
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,379
BUT THE FACILITIES
WILL BE OF LITTLE USE

246
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,841
IF DR. LESTER'S DEAD.

247
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,885
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.
CONTINUE PRESENT COURSE.

248
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,851
AT MAXIMUM SPEED...

249
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,019
STARBASE TWO WOULD STILL
MEET THE EMERGENCY.

250
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,236
CAPTAIN, SHALL I ADVISE
STARFLEET COMMAND

251
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,614
OF THE CHANGE OF PLAN?

252
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,617
NO CHANGE OF PLAN HAS
BEEN ORDERED, LIEUTENANT.

253
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,160
OUR ARRIVAL AT BETA AURIGAE
WILL MERELY BE DELAYED.

254
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,205
OUR GRAVITATIONAL STUDIES
OF THAT BINARY SYSTEM
WILL NOT SUFFER,

255
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,957
AND A LIFE MAY BE SAVED.

256
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,418
THAT IS NOT UNUSUAL PROCEDURE
FOR THE "ENTERPRISE."

257
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,589
Spock: SIR, I BELIEVE
THAT STARFLEET WILL
HAVE TO BE NOTIFIED

258
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,091
THAT OUR RENDEZVOUS WITH
THE STARSHIP "POTEMKIN"

259
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,760
WILL NOT TAKE PLACE
AS SCHEDULED.

260
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,932
MR. SPOCK,
IF YOU'D CONCENTRATE

261
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,225
ON THE AREAS
FOR WHICH YOU
ARE RESPONSIBLE,

262
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,520
STARFLEET COMMAND
WOULD HAVE BEEN
INFORMED ALREADY.

263
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,398
SINCE THE CAPTAIN
USUALLY DEALS DIRECTLY

264
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,692
WITH STARFLEET
IN THESE MATTERS,

265
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,404
I ASSUMED THAT
MY SUGGESTIONS MIGHT
BE DEEMED INTERFERENCE.

266
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,785
INFORM STARFLEET
OF THE DELAY, LIEUTENANT.

267
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:34,786
AYE, SIR.

268
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,955
CONTINUE PRESENT COURSE.

269
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,039
INCREASE SPEED
TO WARP FACTOR 6.

270
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,673
I'LL LET MY RECORD
SPEAK FOR ME.

271
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,924
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO DEFENSIVE?

272
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,467
THERE'S NO IMPLIED
CRITICISM OF YOU

273
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,093
IN MY ORDER TO REMOVE YOU
FROM THE CASE.

274
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,512
THAT IS NOT
THE REASON I'M HERE.

275
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,806
I'M HERE BECAUSE
DR. COLEMAN'S RECORD

276
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,433
STATES THAT
HE'S INCOMPETENT.

277
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,769
THAT'S THE OPINION
OF AN INDIVIDUAL.
NO, SIR.

278
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,896
THAT IS THE OPINION
OF STARFLEET
COMMAND.

279
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,314
I CHECKED WITH THEM.

280
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,108
AND DR. COLEMAN
WAS REMOVED
FROM HIS POST

281
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,986
AS CHIEF MEDICAL
OFFICER OF HIS SHIP

282
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,737
FOR ADMINISTRATIVE
INCOMPETENCE.

283
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,365
THERE ARE
NO ADMINISTRATIVE
DUTIES REQUIRED HERE.

284
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,117
AS WELL AS FLAGRANT
MEDICAL BLUNDERS.

285
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,787
PROMOTIONS AND DEMOTIONS
CAN BE POLITICALLY
MANEUVERED.

286
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,997
YOU KNOW THAT, BONES.

287
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,124
NOT IN STARFLEET
HEADQUARTERS,
CAPTAIN,

288
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,085
AND CERTAINLY NOT
IN THE SURGEON
GENERAL'S OFFICE.

289
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,674
I'M AFRAID THE ORDER
WILL HAVE TO STAND.

290
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,971
I CAN ONLY SAY...

291
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,098
THAT DR. COLEMAN'S
EXPERIENCE WITH WHAT
HAPPENED ON THE PLANET

292
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,934
HAD TO BE THE DECIDING
FACTOR HERE.

293
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,229
I'M SURE THAT YOU CAN
APPRECIATE THAT.

294
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,482
I APPRECIATE
THE FACT THAT YOU HAD
A DECISION TO MAKE.

295
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,569
I ALSO FIND MYSELF
IN THAT POSITION NOW, JIM,

296
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,822
AND I'M ASKING YOU TO REPORT
FOR AN EXAMINATION.

297
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,949
WHY?

298
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,116
WHAT DO YOU
BASE THAT ON?

FROM THAT PLANET.

302
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,838
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE
THAT CHARGE STICK.

303
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,716
ANY FOOL CAN SEE
WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS.

304
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,261
I'LL LET STARFLEET COMMAND
BE THE JUDGE OF MY MOTIVES.

305
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:19,139
I WON'T SUBMIT TO
THIS PETTY SEARCH
FOR REVENGE.

306
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,560
BUT YOU WILL SUBMIT
TO STARFLEET REGULATIONS,

307
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,729
AND THEY STATE
THAT THE SHIP'S SURGEON

308
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,732
WILL REQUIRE FULL EXAMINATION
OF ANY CREW MEMBER

309
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,110
THAT HE HAS DOUBTS ABOUT,
INCLUDING THE CAPTAIN.

[INTERCOM WHISTLES]

311
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,621

312
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,372

REQUESTING ADDITIONAL
DETAILS ON THE DELAY.

314
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,502

BEST FOR YOU.

WHERE IS DR. McCOY?

322
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,965
I'M IN CHARGE NOW.

323
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,883
BRING DR. McCOY AT ONCE.

BY CAPTAIN KIRK?

328
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,228
IT WAS DONE FOR
YOUR OWN PROTECTION,

SHE DID THIS TO ME.

330

MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,819

AND AMBITION.

BRING MR. SPOCK
AND DR. McCOY
TO ME AT ONCE.

335
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,119

I AM IMPRISONED
IN HER BODY,

BUT I AM NOT

339
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,586

FROM THE DELUSION
OF BEING CAPTAIN KIRK.

340

00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,345
THE RADIATION SEEMS
TO HAVE INTENSIFIED IT.

343
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,263
SHE MUST BE KEPT
SEDATED.

344
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,932
SHALL I PREPARE
A MILD SEDATIVE, DOCTOR?

345
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,017
OF COURSE.

346
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,280
YOU ARE INSANE,
DR. LESTER.

347
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:07,391
Lester's voice:
CAPTAIN'S LOG, STARDATE UNKNOWN.

348
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,518
I HAVE LOST TRACK OF TIME.

349
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,021
I AM STILL HELD CAPTIVE
IN A STRANGE BODY

350
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,108
AND SEPARATED
FROM ALL MY CREW.

351
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,693
I MUST HAVE SOUNDED
QUITE MAD TO YOU BEFORE.

352
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,529
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY
BROKEN MOST OF US.

353
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,573
WELL, I'LL
BE ALL RIGHT NOW.

354
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,118
COULD I SEE
YOUR DR. McCOY?

355
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,080
I'M AFRAID THAT'S AGAINST
DR. COLEMAN'S ORDERS.

356
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,749
OH.

357
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,836
IS A VISIT BY THAT
VERY KIND MR. SPOCK
TO BE ALLOWED?

358
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,839
PERHAPS THAT CAN BE ARRANGED
BEFORE WE REACH
THE BENECIA COLONY.

359
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,425
THE BENECIA COLONY?
BUT ISN'T THE "ENTERPRISE"
GOING TO RENDEZVOUS

360
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,970
WITH THE "POTEMKIN"
AT BETA AURIGAE?

361
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,472
WELL, FIRST WE HAVE TO LET YOU
RECUPERATE AT BENECIA.

362
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,935
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE.

363
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,814
WELL, I'LL TRY.
THANK YOU.

364
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,735
OH, IT IS GOOD.
THANK YOU.

365

COULD I FINISH IT
SLOWLY, NURSE CHAPEL?

366
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,121
WELL--
I PROMISE I'LL BE GOOD.

367
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:16,210
WELL, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

368
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,962
I'M GLAD YOU'RE FEELING
SO MUCH BETTER.

369
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,771
THESE TESTS SHOULD HELP ME
PINPOINT THE CAUSE
OF JIM'S ILLNESS.

370
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,607
GOOD. KNOWLEDGE
OF THE CAPTAIN'S
ABERRANT BEHAVIOR

371
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:39,859
IS SPREADING
THROUGH THE SHIP.

372
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,987
THE CREW IS BECOMING
INCREASINGLY TENSE.

373
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,864
YES, WELL,
WHAT WORRIES ME MOST

374
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,074
IS THAT JIM SEEMS
COMPLETELY UNAWARE

375
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,285
THAT SOMETHING IS
WRONG WITH HIM.

376
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:50,995
NOW, WE'VE GOT
TO MAKE HIM REALIZE

377
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,579
THAT SOMETHING SERIOUS
IS HAPPENING

378
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,832
BEFORE TREATMENT
CAN EVEN BEGIN.

379
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,668
I'M AFRAID THAT IS
A FORLORN HOPE, DOCTOR.

380
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,378
THE ILLNESS APPEARS
TO BE PRIMARILY MENTAL.

381
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,048
WELL, ONE OF US SHOULD
BE ABLE TO GET TO HIM.

382

I...I DON'T KNOW.
I KEEP LOOKING
FOR AN APPROACH,

383
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:09,763
BUT THE SPEED OF WHICH
THE ILLNESS HAS TRAVELED
MAKES IT DOUBLY DIFFICULT.

384
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,099
PERHAPS THE SURGEON GENERAL'S
OFFICE SHOULD BE ALERTED.

385

THEY'RE ONLY
INTERESTED IN RESULTS
OF SPECIFIC TESTS.

00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,315
SO FAR, ALL WE HAVE TO
OFFER ARE OUR OPINIONS.

388
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,359
ARE YOU SURE THAT
THE CAPTAIN WILL COMPLY

389
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,777
WITH YOUR ORDER IN
HIS PRESENT STATE OF MIND?

390
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,655
I'LL USE MY MEDICAL
AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE IT
IF NECESSARY.

391
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:35,956

ON VERY THIN GROUND.

392
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,752

MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED.

IS CLEAR.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE
CAPTAIN ON THAT PLANET

396
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,261
MUST HAVE TAKEN PLACE
IN THE SHORT
SPACE OF TIME

397
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,763
THAT HE WAS ALONE
WITH DR. LESTER.

398
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,933
PERHAPS A CONVERSATION
WITH HER MIGHT SHED
SOME LIGHT.

399
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,642
WELL, IT'S WORTH A TRY.

400
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,145
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TO GET TO DR. LESTER
WHILE I EXAMINE JIM?

DON'T LET THEM LOCK ME
AWAY FROM YOU.

TO TALK TO YOU--

406
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,798
SHE MIGHT
HAVE KILLED SOMEONE.

407
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,799
PUT HER IN ISOLATION
IN HER ROOM.

A 24-HOUR WATCH.

409
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,720

IS TO TALK TO HER
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

410
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:32,805

HOW IS
THE DOCTOR?

413
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:59,081
SHE REGAINED
CONSCIOUSNESS
VERY QUICKLY.

414
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,167
GOOD. I HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS
TO ASK HER.

415
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,793
DID THE CAPTAIN
ORDER IT, SIR?

416
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,920
WHY SHOULD HE?
THEY'RE
MY QUESTIONS,

THEREFORE I AM
ORDERING IT,

418
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,300

THAT NO ONE IS ALLOWED
TO SPEAK TO DR. LESTER.

AN ORDER

NO, SIR.

422
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:18,184
MR. SPOCK, I THINK
THE CAPTAIN MEANT

423
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,435
THAT A GUARD
SHOULD BE PRESENT.

511
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,309
QUITE ALL RIGHT, ENSIGN.
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.

512
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:19,943
PHASERS.

513
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,945
THE REPETITION OF
YOUR PHYSICAL VIOLENCE

514
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,282
IS NOT CALLED FOR...SIR.

515
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,452
Spock:
NO PHYSICAL RESISTANCE
WILL BE OFFERED.

516
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,341
ATTENTION, ALL PERSONNEL.

517
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,802
FIRST OFFICER SPOCK HAS
BEEN PLACED UNDER ARREST.

518
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,971
HE HAS CONSPIRED
WITH DR. LESTER

519
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,931
TO TAKE OVER THE SHIP
FROM YOUR CAPTAIN.

520
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,559
A HEARING WILL BE
IMMEDIATELY CONVENED

521
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,479
TO CONSIDER THE CHARGES
AND SPECIFICATIONS

522
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,564
OF A GENERAL COURT-MARTIAL

523
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,899
ON THE CHARGE...

524
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:00,984
OF MUTINY.

525
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:11,161
KIRK'S VOICE:
CAPTAIN'S LOG, STARDATE 5930.3.

526
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,246
THE RESULTS OF
DR. MCCOY'S EXAMINATION

527
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,915
HAVE GIVEN ME COMPLETE
CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF.

528
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,626
MY FEARS ARE PAST.

529
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,961
I SHALL FUNCTION FREELY
AS THE CAPTAIN.

530
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,298
I AM THE CAPTAIN
OF THE "ENTERPRISE," IN FACT.

531
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,843
SURELY YOU MUST HAVE
MORE THAN THAT TO GO ON.

532
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,594
I HAVE STATED
MY EVIDENCE--

533
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:32,224
TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION
WITH THE MIND OF
CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK.

534
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,686
YOUR EVIDENCE IS
COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE.

535
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:40,357
WE HAVE TO HAVE EVIDENCE
THAT WE CAN EXAMINE
OUT IN THE OPEN.

536
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,150
SPOCK:
YOU'VE HAD A GREAT
DEAL OF EVIDENCE,

537
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,861
EXCEPT THAT OF
THE CHIEF WITNESS.

538
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,988
THE ONE WHO SHOULD
BE THE REAL SUBJECT
OF THIS INVESTIGATION

539
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,492
IS KEPT LOCKED AWAY
AND IN ISOLATION.

540
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,202
WHY...

541
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,663
CAPTAIN?

542
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,498
SHE'S DANGEROUSLY INSANE.

543
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,500
WE'VE SEEN THE EVIDENCE.

544
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,545
SHE IS DANGEROUS ONLY
TO YOUR AUTHORITY, SIR.

545
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,048
MR. SPOCK...

546
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,264
MR. SPOCK, MY AUTHORITY
HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ME
BY STARFLEET COMMAND,

547
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,642
AND ONLY
THAT HIGH AUTHORITY
CAN TAKE IT AWAY.

548
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,729
THE WITNESS, SIR.
BRING ON THE WITNESS.

549
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,647
LET YOUR OFFICERS PUT
THE QUESTIONS.

550
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,449
MR. LEMLI,

551
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,576
HAVE DR. JANICE LESTER
BROUGHT HERE.

552
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,660
AYE, SIR.

553
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,339
DR. MCCOY...

554
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,759
WHILE MR. SPOCK
WAS BUSY WITH
HIS AMBITIOUS PLOT,

555
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,636
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

556
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,387
EXAMINING YOU.

557
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,432
OH, YES. YOU WERE
DEEPLY CONCERNED
ABOUT MY HEALTH,

558
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,725
EMOTIONAL
AND PHYSICAL,

559
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,311
SINCE LEAVING CAMUS II.
IS THAT CORRECT?

560
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,020
YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

561
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,481
AND INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO DESTROY ME,

562
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,276
YOU WERE SEARCHING
FOR WAYS TO HELP ME.

563
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,820
DR. MCCOY,

564
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:12,157
FOR THE RECORD,
WILL YOU TELL THE COURT
YOUR FINDINGS?

565
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,701
THE CAPTAIN IS IN THE BEST
OF PHYSICAL CONDITION.

566
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,078
HIS EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL
STATE IS COMPARABLE

567
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,749
TO THE TIME THAT
HE ASSUMED COMMAND
OF THE "ENTERPRISE."

568
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:23,168
THANK YOU, DR. MCCOY.

569
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:28,047
MR. SPOCK, WERE YOU AWARE
OF DR. MCCOY'S FINDINGS?

570
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,633
I KNOW THEM NOW.

571
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:32,010
AND WHAT HAVE YOU
TO SAY NOW?

572
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,220
I AM DISAPPOINTED
AND DEEPLY CONCERNED

573
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,891
THAT THERE IS NO
OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE TO
SUPPORT MY POSITION...

574
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,101
SO FAR.

575
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,186
[DOOR OPENS]

576
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,527
DR. COLEMAN,
IF YOU'RE REQUIRED HERE,

577
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,653
WE'LL CALL YOU.

578
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,331
WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE
YOUR BEING HERE.

579
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,709
EVERYONE IS DEEPLY AWARE
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN

580
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,670
SUBJECTED TO INORDINATE
EMOTIONAL STRESS.

581
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,922
WE'D HOPED TO AVOID
ANY FURTHER STRESS,

582
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,091
BUT...MR. SPOCK
DISAGREES.

583
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,178
IT'S HIS OPINION
THAT YOUR TESTIMONY
IS IMPORTANT

584
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,806
IN DETERMINING
THE MERITS OF THIS CASE.

585
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:22,310
AND SINCE WE ARE SOLELY
INTERESTED IN ARRIVING
AT A JUST DECISION,

586
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:26,231
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

587
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,440
I'LL TRY NOT TO UPSET YOU.

588
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,824
YOU, UH,
CLAIM THAT, UH...

589
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:38,702
[CHUCKLES]

590
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,829
THAT YOU ARE
CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK?

591
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:44,332
NO. I AM NOT
CAPTAIN KIRK.

592
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,292
THAT IS
VERY APPARENT.

593
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,462
I CLAIM THAT
WHATEVER IT IS THAT
MAKES JAMES KIRK

594
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,382
A LIVING BEING
SPECIAL TO HIMSELF

595
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,885
IS BEING HELD HERE
IN THIS BODY.

596
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,219
OH.

597
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,472
HOWEVER,
A-AS I UNDERSTAND IT...

598
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,225
I...AM DR. JANICE LESTER.

599
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,274
THAT'S VERY CLEVER,

600
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,317
BUT I DIDN'T SAY IT.

601
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,905
I SAID, THE BODY OF
JAMES KIRK IS BEING USED

602
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,949
BY DR. JANICE LESTER.

603
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,869
MM-HMM. SUBTLENESS
AND OBFUSCATION.

604
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,622
I ASSUME THAT THIS,
UH...

605
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,541
SWITCH WAS ARRIVED AT
BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT.

606
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:30,336
NO. IT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT
BY A VIOLENT ATTACK
BY DR. LESTER

607
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,799
AND THE USE OF EQUIPMENT
SHE DISCOVERED
ON CAMUS II.

608
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,593
VIOLENCE...

609
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,053
BY THE LADY...

610
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,679
PERPETRATED
ON CAPTAIN KIRK?

611
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,514
TSK TSK TSK.

612
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,268
I ASK THE ASSEMBLED
PERSONNEL TO LOOK
AT DR. JANICE LESTER

613
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:49,773
AND VISUALIZE
THAT HISTORIC MOMENT.

614
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:53,693
CAN YOU--CAN YOU TELL ME
WHY, UH, DR. JANICE LESTER

615
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:57,614
WOULD AGREE TO
THIS LUDICROUS EXCHANGE?

616
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,493
YES. TO GET
THE POWER SHE CRAVED,

617
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,037
TO ATTAIN A POSITION
SHE DOESN'T MERIT

618
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,706
BY TEMPERAMENT
OR TRAINING,

619
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,836
AND MOST OF ALL,
SHE WANTED TO
MURDER JAMES KIRK,

620
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,505
A MAN WHO ONCE
LOVED HER,

621
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,050
BUT HER INTENSE HATRED
OF HER OWN WOMANHOOD

622
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,469
MADE LIFE WITH HER
IMPOSSIBLE.

623
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,266
ARE YOU PREPARED
WITH WITNESSES?
ONE WILL DO.

624
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,977
SIR...

625
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,688
THERE IS ONLY
ONE ISSUE HERE.

626
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,399
IS THE STORY OF
LIFE-ENTITY TRANSFER
BELIEVABLE?

627
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,777
THIS CREW HAS BEEN
TO MANY PLACES
IN THE GALAXY.

628
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,071
THEY'VE BEEN
WITNESS TO MANY
STRANGE EVENTS.

629
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,614
THEY'RE TRAINED
TO KNOW

630
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:43,326
THAT WHAT SEEMS
TO BE IMPOSSIBLE
OFTEN IS POSSIBLE,

631
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,245
GIVEN THE SCIENTIFIC
ANALYSIS OF
THE PHENOMENON.

632
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,582
MM-HMM. AND, MR. SPOCK,
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A CASE

633
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,127
SUCH AS DESCRIBED
BY DR. JANICE LESTER?

634
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,795
NOT PRECISELY, NO.

635
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,296
OH.

636
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,508
ASSUMING THAT YOU ARE
CORRECT IN YOUR BELIEF,

637
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,428
DO YOU EXPECT
STARFLEET COMMAND
TO PLACE THIS, UH...

638
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,556
THIS, UH, PERSON...

639
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,100
IN COMMAND
OF THE "ENTERPRISE"?

640
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:10,603
I EXPECT ONLY
TO REVEAL THE TRUTH.

641
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,023
AND WITH THE TRUTH
REVEALED THAT I AM
NOT REALLY THE CAPTAIN,

642
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,734
AND KNOWING THAT SHE
WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED
TO SERVE AS THE CAPTAIN,

643
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,862
THEN YOU WOULD
BE THE CAPTAIN!
IT IS INEVITABLE.

644
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,414
SPOCK...
SPOCK, GIVE IT UP.

645
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,749
RETURN TO
THE "ENTERPRISE" FAMILY.

646
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,667
ALL CHARGES
WILL BE DROPPED,

647
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:37,005
AND THE--THE MADNESS
THAT TEMPORARILY OVERCAME
ALL OF US ON CAMUS II

648
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,882
WILL FADE
AND BE FORGOTTEN.

649
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:42,427
AND WHAT WILL BECOME
OF DR. LESTER?

650
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,637
DR. LESTER WILL BE
CARED FOR, ALWAYS.

651
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,639
IT IS A DEBT
AND A RESPONSIBILITY

652
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,474
I OWE HER FROM THE PAST.

653
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,687
NO, SIR. I SHALL NOT
WITHDRAW A SINGLE CHARGE
THAT I HAVE MADE.

654
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,564
YOU ARE
NOT CAPTAIN KIRK.

655
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,942
YOU HAVE RUTHLESSLY
APPROPRIATED HIS BODY,

656
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,945
BUT THE LIFE ENTITY
WITHIN YOU IS NOT
THAT OF CAPTAIN KIRK.

657
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,197
YOU DO NOT
BELONG IN CHARGE
OF THE "ENTERPRISE,"

658
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,075
AND I SHALL
DO EVERYTHING IN
MY POWER AGAINST YOU.

659
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:17,003
LIEUTENANT LISA, PLAY BACK
THOSE LAST TWO SENTENCES
FROM MR. SPOCK'S TIRADE.

660
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,719
SPOCK ON TAPE: YOU DO NOT BELONG
IN CHARGE OF THE "ENTERPRISE,"

661
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,180
AND I SHALL DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER AGAINST YOU.

662
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,641
YOU HEARD THE STATEMENTS PLACED
INTO THE RECORD BY YOU.

663
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,059
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THE NATURE OF IT?

664
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,812
I DO,
AND I STAND BY IT.

665
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,482
IT IS MUTINY!

666
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,359
DELIBERATE, VINDICTIVE,
INSANE AT ITS BASE!

667
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,280
BUT MUTINY AS CHARGED
AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF MUTINY!

668
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,824
DR. MCCOY, MR. SCOTT,
YOU HEARD IT.

669
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,033
ON THE BASIS
OF THESE STATEMENTS,

670
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,785
I CALL FOR
AN IMMEDIATE VOTE

671
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,579
BY THE POWERS GRANTED
TO ME AS CAPTAIN OF
THE "ENTERPRISE."

672
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:55,583
A RECESS IS DECLARED,
TO BE FOLLOWED BY A VOTE.

673
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,376
SPOCK: YES, SIR,
AN IMMEDIATE VOTE

674
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,839
BEFORE OUR CHIEF WITNESS
CAN BE LEFT TO DIE
ON SOME OBSCURE PLANET

675
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,632
WITH THE TRUTH LOCKED
AWAY INSIDE OF HER.

676
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,094
SILENCE!

AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

693

IT MAY NOT BE SCIENTIFIC,

BUT IF MR. SPOCK
THINKS IT HAPPENED,

695
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,503

THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE CAPTAIN.

698

701

THE CAPTAIN OF THE "ENTERPRISE"

702
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,567
IS OUR PROBLEM.

703

THE VOTE IN A FEW MINUTES.

704

ONE LAST QUESTION.

SUPPOSE YOU VOTE WITH ME
IN FAVOR OF SPOCK.

706
00:40:55,703 --> 00:41:00,041
THAT MEANS TWO VOTES TO ONE
AND SPOCK IS FREE.

00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,793

THE CAPTAIN WILL DO?

708

712

HE CAN GET AWAY
