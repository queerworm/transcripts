00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,333

IT FITS, JIM.

166
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,291
SHE MUST BE AN EMPATH.

167
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,083
HER NERVOUS SYSTEM
IS SO SENSITIVE,
HIGHLY RESPONSIVE,

168

00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,709
ELECTRONICALLY
SOPHISTICATED
DEVICES.

177
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:08,750
I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
WHY MY TRICORDER

178
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,291
PREVIOUSLY GAVE
NO INDICATION OF
THEM BEING OUT THERE.

179
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,875
WELL, THEY'RE THERE NOW.
LET'S GO CHECK THEM OUT.

180
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,125
STAYING HERE ALONE
COULD BE DANGEROUS.

181
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:17,959
COME WITH US.

182
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:00,000
FASCINATING.

183
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,208
LOOK AT THIS STUFF.

184
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,917
BONES...

185
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,792
SPOCK, COME HERE.

186
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,709
JIM, SPOCK.

187
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,625
YOU ARE ON SCHEDULE.

188
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,792
SOME FURTHER SIMPLE
TESTS ARE NECESSARY.

189
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:16,542
WE'VE JUST SEEN THE RESULTS
OF SOME OF YOUR TESTS.

190
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,500
I FOUND OUR
MISSING MEN...DEAD.

191
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,125
ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR EXPERIMENTS?

192
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,083
YOU'RE WRONG.
THEIR OWN IMPERFECTIONS
KILLED THEM.

193
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,250
THEY WERE NOT FIT SUBJECTS.

194
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,083
COME.

195
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,000
TIME IS SHORT.

196
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,041
YES. YOUR TIME
IS RUNNING OUT.

197
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,834
THIS SUN IS
ABOUT TO NOVA.

198
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:36,667
WHEN IT DOES,
IT'LL DESTROY YOU,
THIS PLANET,

199
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,667
AND THIS INSANE
TORTURE CHAMBER.

200
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,667
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

201
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,792
READINGS INDICATE THE
PASSAGE TO THE SURFACE

202
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,750
LIES IN THIS DIRECTION.

203
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,834
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

204
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:29,625
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>
<i>COME IN.</i>

205
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,667
OUT OF RANGE.

206
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,041
READINGS, MR. SPOCK.

207
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,875
THE RESEARCH STATION
6 KILOMETERS

208
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,875
IN THAT DIRECTION,
CAPTAIN.

209
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,625
LET'S GET THERE
AS FAST AS WE CAN.

210
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,041
IF THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
<i>HAS A SEARCH PARTY,</i>
<i>IT'LL BE THERE.</i>

211
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:02,250
SPOCK!

212
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,375
MUCH FURTHER?

213
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,417
JUST AHEAD.

214
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:11,583
HEY, JIM, LOOK.

215
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,625
SCOTTY AND
A SEARCH PARTY.

216
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,000
-SCOTTY!
-SCOTTY!

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,875
STAY THERE!

218
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:18,792
COME ON!

219
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:19,291
WE'RE COMING!

220
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:31,959
KEEP GOING.

221
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:48,291
THEIR WILL
TO SURVIVE IS GREAT.

222
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,709
THEY LOVE LIFE GREATLY
TO STRUGGLE SO.

223
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:55,917
THE PRIME INGREDIENT.

224
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,041
WHERE DID THEY GO?

225
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,875
I BELIEVE THEY
WERE NEVER ACTUALLY
PRESENT, DOCTOR.

226
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,625
IT WAS A MIRAGE.

227
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,208
WHERE'S KIRK?

228
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,750
JIM.

229
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,333
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?
WHERE'S SCOTTY?

230
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,750
CAPTAIN,
IT WAS A MIRAGE.

231
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,458
CAPTAIN KIRK!

232
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:07,166
WE HAVE DECIDED
THAT ONE SPECIMEN
WILL BE SUFFICIENT.

233
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,083
YOU WILL
COME WITH US.

234
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,750
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS?

235
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,583
WE HAVE NO
INTEREST IN THEM.

236
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,333
THEY MAY GO.

237
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,542
VERY WELL.

238
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:21,333
YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE.
YOU'LL END UP LIKE
THE OTHER TWO.

239
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,000
CAPTAIN, I REQUEST
PERMISSION TO BE
ALLOWED TO--

240
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,583
-DENIED!
-BUT, CAPTAIN--

241
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,667
YOU HAVE YOUR ORDERS.

242
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:43,000
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY MEN?!

243
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,417
THEY ARE SAFE.

244
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,166
ONE SPECIMEN!
YOU SAID ONE SPECIMEN!

245
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,291
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY MEN?

246
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,750
INDEED, THE PRIME
INGREDIENT.

247
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,125
WHERE ARE THEY?
TELL ME!

248
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,291
YOU SAID YOU'D
LET THEM GO!

249
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,417
MR. SULU,

250
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:04,250
WILL YOU GIVE US
AN ESTIMATE ON
HOW MUCH LONGER

251
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,542
WE'LL HAVE UNTIL THOSE
SOLAR FLARES SUBSIDE?

252
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:07,625
AYE, SIR.

253
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:13,000
READINGS
NOW INDICATE 2.721

254
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,375
ON THE RITTER SCALE.

255
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,333
AT THE PRESENT
RATE OF DECREASE,

256
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,417
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT
AT LEAST 17 HOURS MORE

257
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:22,250
BEFORE WE
CAN EVEN ATTEMPT
TO ENTER ORBIT.

258
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,083
AYE.

259
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:28,083
WELL, AS LONG AS
WE'RE STUCK OUT HERE,

260
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:32,709
WE MIGHT AS WELL RELAX
UNTIL THE STORM PASSES.

261
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:36,542
THE STORM'S ALREADY
LASTED 4 HOURS LONGER
THAN WE'VE ANTICIPATED.

262
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,625
DO YOU SUPPOSE
OUR LANDING PARTY
COULD BE IN ANY DANGER?

263
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,166
THAT'S NOT LIKELY.

264
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:46,083
THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE
WILL GIVE THEM
AMPLE PROTECTION.

265
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,166
AND IF I KNOW CAPTAIN KIRK,

266
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,333
HE'LL BE MORE
WORRIED ABOUT US
THAN WE ARE ABOUT HIM.

267
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,959
AAH!

268
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,000
WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT TO KNOW?

269
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,375
WE SEEK
NO INFORMATION
AS YOU MEAN.

270
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,667
YOUR CIVILIZATION
IS YET TOO IMMATURE

271
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,959
TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE
OF VALUE TO US.

272
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,333
YOU DON'T NEED ANY
KNOWLEDGE FROM US,

273
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,250
YET YOU'RE WILLING
TO KILL FOR IT.

274
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,667
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED
TO LINKE AND OZABA?

275
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,625
WE DID NOT KILL THEM.

276
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,041
THEIR OWN
FEARS KILLED THEM.

277
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,000
WELL, WHAT DID YOU
EXPECT FROM THEM?

278
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,417
AND WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME?

279
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,291
WE'VE ALREADY
OBSERVED THE INTENSITY
OF YOUR PASSIONS,

280
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:35,000
AND GAUGED
YOUR CAPACITY
TO LOVE OTHERS.

281
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,458
NOW WE WANT YOU
TO REVEAL TO US
YOUR COURAGE

282
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,834
AND STRENGTH OF WILL.

283
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,792
WHY?

284
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,667
WHAT IS IT
YOU HOPE TO PROVE?

285
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:47,458
IF MY DEATH IS
TO HAVE ANY MEANING,

286
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:52,166
AT LEAST TELL ME
WHAT I'M DYING FOR.

287
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,917
IF YOU LIVE,
YOU WILL HAVE YOUR ANSWER.

288
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,625
AAH!

289
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,291
UHH!

290
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,667
COME ON, SPOCK,
THE PASSAGEWAY
WAS THERE BEFORE.

291
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,667
IT'S GOT TO BE THERE.

292
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,375
DOCTOR,
I AM UNABLE TO LOCK IN
ON THE PREVIOUS READINGS.

293
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,917
I CAN FIND
NO EXIT OUT OF HERE.

294
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:39,875
CAPTAIN!

295
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,500
JIM, WHAT IS IT?
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU?

296
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:05,208
HELP HIM! DON'T BE
AFRAID TO HELP HIM.

297
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,333
GEM.

298
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,875
YOU LIE STILL.
I'LL CHECK HER OUT
RIGHT AWAY.

299
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,208
WILL SHE LIVE?

300
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,500
SHE SEEMS
FINE NOW.

301
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,542
CAN YOU EXPLAIN
WHAT HAPPENED?

302
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,125
COMPLETE EMPATHY.

303
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,709
SHE MUST BE A TOTALLY
FUNCTIONAL EMPATH.

304
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,125
HER NERVOUS SYSTEM
ACTUALLY CONNECTED
TO YOURS

305
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,792
TO COUNTERACT THE WORST
OF YOUR SYMPTOMS.

306
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,250
AND WITH HER STRENGTH,

307
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,125
SHE VIRTUALLY
SUSTAINED YOUR BODY'S
PHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIONS.

308
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,792
BUT SHE WEAKENED.
I COULD FEEL IT.

309
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:34,125
IS HER LIFE IN DANGER?

310
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,417
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO SAY YET,

311
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:39,917
BUT SUPPLYING YOUR BODY
WITH LIFE SUPPORT
DID DRAIN HER.

312
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:42,959
HER WITHDRAWAL SEEMED
TO SUGGEST THE FEAR
OF DEATH, DOCTOR.

313
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:46,333
ONLY YOUR URGING HER ON
CAUSED HER TO CONTINUE.

314
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,834
THAT'S TRUE. FEAR
WOULD NATURALLY BE
A FIRST REACTION.

315
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,667
PERHAPS SHE DOESN'T
KNOW OUR CAPTAIN
WELL ENOUGH YET

316
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:54,166
TO OFFER UP
HER LIFE FOR HIM.

317
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:57,417
COULD THE STRAIN
REALLY HAVE KILLED HER?

318
00:24:57,417 --> 00:25:00,458
OH, YES. HOWEVER, I WOULD
ASSUME THAT HER INSTINCT
FOR SELF-PRESERVATION

319
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,291
WOULD TAKE OVER
TO PREVENT IT.

320
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:03,667
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

321
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:07,750
I'M...

322
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,834
TIRED.

323
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:10,792
CAN YOU RECALL
WHAT HAPPENED, CAPTAIN?

324
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:15,583
I REMEMBER
THE LABORATORY,

325
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:19,625
AND THEY WANTED
TO KNOW SOMETHING.

326
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,625
BUT I...
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

327
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:24,709
TAKE IT EASY.

328
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:26,583
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ME?

329
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:29,166
YOU HAVE ALL THE
SYMPTOMS OF THE BENDS.

330
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,917
NITROGEN BUBBLES
IN YOUR BLOOD
CAUSED THE PAIN.

331
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:35,125
NOW, HOW WOULD ONE
GET THE BENDS DOWN HERE?

332
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,583
YOU'LL HAVE
TO ASK THE VIANS.

333
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,500
WILL I LIVE?

334
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,417
WELL, YOU COULD USE
SOME TIME IN
A DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER.

335
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,959
BUT OTHERWISE,
I'D SAY YOUR RECOVERY
IS JUST ABOUT MIRACULOUS.

336
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,041
I WISH I COULD
TAKE THE CREDIT FOR IT,

337
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:49,709
BUT SHE DID THE WORK.

338
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:54,709
CAPTAIN, I NOTED THAT
A LIGHT PRECEDED YOU

339
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:57,792
AT THE MOMENT
YOU WERE RETURNED HERE
FROM THE VIANS' LABORATORY.

340
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:00,250
SPOCK,
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
GET SO ANALYTICAL--

341
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,667
HE'S RIGHT. CONTINUE.

342
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:04,625
I CONCLUDE THAT SUCH
A LIGHT IS AN ENERGY
TRANSFER POINT

343
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,250
LINKING THIS DEVICE
TO THE POWER SOURCE.

344
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,208
CAN YOU TAP INTO IT?

345
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:12,250
IF I CAN DETERMINE
THE FREQUENCY AT WHICH
THIS DEVICE OPERATES,

346
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,375
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO CAUSE
IT TO FUNCTION FOR US.

347
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:17,208
AND GET US OUT OF HERE
THE SAME WAY
THEY BROUGHT US IN.

348
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,208
I WOULD SAY SO.

349
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:18,792
THEN I WOULD SAY PROCEED.

350
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,500
YOU ARE CALLED CAPTAIN.

351
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,834
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE LIVES OF YOUR CREW.

352
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,250
IS THIS CORRECT?

353
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,291
IT IS.

354
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,917

TO HAVE THE COOPERATION

355
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:36,250
OF ONE OF YOUR MEN
IN OUR EFFORTS.

356
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,166
WE WILL NOT COOPERATE.

357
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,583
WHEN WE RESUME
OUR INTERROGATIONS,

358
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,667
YOU WILL DECIDE WHICH OF
YOUR MEN WE SHALL USE.

359
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:46,333
IT IS ESSENTIAL.

360
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:49,709
THERE'S AN 87% CHANCE
THAT THE DOCTOR WILL DIE,

361
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:53,500
AND WHILE COMMANDER SPOCK'S
LIFE IS NOT IN DANGER,

362
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,834
THE POSSIBILITY IS 93%

363
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:58,125
THAT HE WILL SUFFER
BRAIN DAMAGE

364
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:00,875

PERMANENT INSANITY.

366

BUT THAT IS ALL.

BEFORE THE VIANS COME BACK.

HOW THAT THING WORKS,

NOT A COAL MINER.

FOR YOU AND THE CAPTAIN

THE CAPTAIN.

400
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:43,000

401
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,000
HOW LONG WILL HE
BE ASLEEP, DOCTOR?

402

THE EMOTIONAL STRAIN

403

OF BENDS,

404
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:54,208

BAD SHAPE.

405

YOUR ACTION, DOCTOR.

I'M QUITE GRATEFUL FOR IT.

SPARED THE STRAIN

A DECISION.

409

YOU HAVE SIMPLIFIED
THE SITUATION CONSIDERABLY.

00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:08,083

IS ASLEEP,

GIVEN HIM THAT SHOT--

PRECISELY.
THE CHOICE WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE CAPTAIN'S.

417
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,542
NOW IT IS MINE.

418
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,083

IS HIGHLY UNETHICAL.

COME, THEN.

425
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,125

426
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,709
PLEASE UNDERSTAND
THAT IF THERE WAS
ANY OTHER WAY

00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:28,000

OUR PURPOSE...

429
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:51,125
WHY DID YOU
LET HIM DO IT?

430
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,417
I WAS CONVINCED IN THE SAME
WAY YOU WERE, CAPTAIN,

431

434
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,333

435
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,500
IT IS A CONTROL UNIT,

436
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,583
BUT NOT A CONTROL MECHANISM.

437
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,625
IN FACT, IT IS NOT
A MECHANICAL DEVICE.

00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:07,041
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT?

439
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,208
THIS CONTROL IS ATTUNED

BY THE MENTAL IMPULSES

OF THE PERSON
WHO POSSESSES IT.

443
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:19,417
IT IS ACTIVATED SOLELY
BY MENTAL COMMANDS.

444
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:23,709
CAN YOU ADAPT IT,
RE-ATTUNE IT TO FIT
OUR BRAIN PATTERN?

445

I SHALL ATTEMPT TO DO SO.

446
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:29,041
HOWEVER, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE
TO ADJUST THE CONTROL

ONE PATTERN AT A TIME.

LET US KEEP IT.

FASCINATING.
THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN

453
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,667
WE WERE CAPABLE OF
COMPREHENDING THIS CONTROL

454

AND MAKING USE OF IT.

455
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,291
AND THAT WE WOULD
USE IT TO ESCAPE.

456
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:51,834
THE ONLY LOGICAL ASSUMPTION

457
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:54,250
IS THAT THEY WISH
TO LET US GO.

THREATEN HER.

THAT SHE IS ESSENTIAL

DR. McCOY'S ANALYSIS
OF HER REACTION

525
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,125
ASSUMES THAT HER INSTINCT
FOR SELF-PRESERVATION

526
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,458
WOULD PREVENT IT.

527
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,083
HOWEVER, WE CANNOT
BE POSITIVE.

528
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,667
IF SHE COULD JUST
STRENGTHEN HIM

529
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:40,083
AND KEEP HIM
FROM SINKING FURTHER
INTO DEATH,

530
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,333
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO SAVE HIM.

531
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,333
NO INTERFERENCE
WILL BE PERMITTED.

532
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,458
SHE COULD SAVE
HIS LIFE.

533
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:56,041
LET US HELP HER
TO GO TO HIM.

534
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,667
SHE MUST NOT BE
URGED OR FORCED
TO TAKE ACTION.

535
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,917
ALL MUST PROCEED
WITHOUT
INTERFERENCE.

536
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:04,375
THE PURPOSE
THAT BROUGHT US
TOGETHER--

537
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,291
WHAT PURPOSE CAN
ALL THIS SERVE,

538
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:08,500
EXCEPT THE FULFILLMENT
OF SOME NEED OF YOURS?

539
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,875
WE HAVE BUT ONE NEED
LEFT IN LIFE--

540
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,500
AND THAT IS
TO SEE THE COMPLETION

541
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,417
OF THE FINAL MOMENT
OF OUR TEST.

542
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,625
BE PATIENT.

543
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,792
PATIENT? OUR FRIEND
IS DYING.

544
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,834
PERHAPS.

545
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:21,959
WHAT PURPOSE CAN BE SERVED
BY THE DEATH OF OUR FRIEND

546
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:23,834
EXCEPT TO BRING YOU PLEASURE?

547
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,834
SURELY BEINGS AS ADVANCED
AS YOURSELVES

548
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:28,166
KNOW THAT YOUR STAR SYSTEM
WILL SOON BE EXTINCT.

549
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,959
YOUR SUN WILL NOVA.

550
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,250
WE KNOW.

551
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,208
THEN YOU ALSO KNOW

552
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,333
THAT THE MILLIONS
OF INHABITANTS

553
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,875
ON ITS PLANETS ARE DOOMED.

554
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,208
THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE.

555
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:41,542
THIS ARENA OF DEATH
THAT YOU HAVE DEVISED
FOR YOUR PLEASURE--

556
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:44,291
WILL IT PREVENT
THIS CATASTROPHE?

557
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,542
NO, IT WILL NOT,

558
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:48,542
BUT IT MAY SAVE
GEM'S PLANET.

559
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,500
OF ALL THE PLANETS
OF MINARA,

560
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
WE HAVE THE POWER
TO TRANSPORT

561
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,000
THE INHABITANTS OF
ONLY ONE TO SAFETY.

562
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,458
IF GEM'S PLANET
IS THE ONE THAT
WILL BE SAVED,

563
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,333
WE MUST
MAKE CERTAIN

564
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,542
BEYOND ANY DOUBT
WHATSOEVER

565
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:04,583
THEY ARE WORTHY
OF SURVIVAL.

566
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:08,792
HOW WILL THE DEATH
OF OUR FRIEND
SERVE THIS PURPOSE?

567
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:12,083
HIS DEATH
WILL NOT SERVE IT,

568
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,000
BUT HER WILLINGNESS TO GIVE
HER LIFE FOR HIM WILL.

569
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,000
YOU WERE HER TEACHERS.

570
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,792
WE WERE?

571
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:23,250
WHAT COULD SHE
LEARN FROM US?

572
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,875
YOUR WILL TO SURVIVE.

573
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,333
YOUR LOVE OF LIFE.

574
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,458
YOUR PASSION TO KNOW.

575
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:33,083
THEY ARE RECORDED
IN HER BEING.

576
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:37,083
HER PLANET WILL
BE FORTUNATE.

577
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,291
EACH OF YOU WAS WILLING
TO GIVE HIS LIFE

578
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:40,875
FOR THE OTHERS.

579
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:43,500
WE MUST NOW FIND OUT
WHETHER THAT INSTINCT

580
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,125
HAS BEEN TRANSMITTED
TO GEM.

581
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:47,166
[RUMBLING]

582
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,208
TIME GROWS SHORT.

583
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,667
YOU WERE CORRECT,
CAPTAIN.

584
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,709
EVERYTHING THAT
HAS OCCURRED HERE

585
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:57,083
HAS BEEN CAUSED
TO HAPPEN BY THEM.

586
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,750
THIS HAS ALL BEEN
A GREAT LABORATORY,

587
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,917
AND WE HAVE BEEN
THE SUBJECTS OF THE TEST.

588
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,500
NO.

589
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,125
WE ONLY CREATED
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

590
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,458
THAT WAS NECESSARY.

591
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:11,083
YOUR ACTIONS
WERE SPONTANEOUS.

592
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:13,709
EVERYTHING THAT IS
TRUEST AND BEST

593
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:17,000
IN ALL SPECIES OF BEINGS
HAS BEEN REVEALED BY YOU.

594
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,125
THOSE ARE THE QUALITIES
THAT MAKE A CIVILIZATION

595
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,458
WORTHY TO SURVIVE.

596
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,417
BEHOLD.

597
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:55,959
THAT IS MOST
SIGNIFICANT.

598
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:59,125
AN INSTINCT
NEW TO THE ESSENCE
OF HER BEING

599
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,500
IS GENERATING.

600
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,959
COMPASSION FOR ANOTHER

601
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:06,875
IS BECOMING PART OF HER
FUNCTIONING LIFE SYSTEM.

602
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:05,000
SHE IS AFRAID.

603
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,250
SHE'S SAVING HERSELF.

604
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:14,750
SHE DOES NOT YET
HAVE THE INSTINCT

605
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,792
TO SAVE HER PEOPLE.

606
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:24,250
WE HAVE FAILED.

607
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:26,667
NO.

608
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:29,792
NO, NOT YET.

609
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:35,458
CAPTAIN,
DR. McCOY'S LIFE

610
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:37,875
IS NOT SOLELY
DEPENDENT ON GEM.

611
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:41,250
THE VIANS, TOO,
MUST BE CAPABLE
OF SAVING HIS LIFE.

612
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,500
TRUE.

613
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,291
THEN YOU CANNOT
LET HIM DIE.

614
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,166
HIS DEATH IS NOT
IMPORTANT.

615
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,375
WE MUST WAIT TO SEE
WHETHER HER INSTINCT
FOR SELF-SACRIFICE

616
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:53,875
HAS BECOME STRONGER
THAN HER INSTINCT
FOR SELF-PRESERVATION.

617
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:05,000
[COUGHING]

618
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,792
[COUGHING]

619
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,125
DON'T TOUCH ME.

620
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:26,333
STAY AWAY.

621
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,834
JIM.

622
00:44:31,834 --> 00:44:33,500
SPOCK.

623
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,125
ARE YOU HERE?

624
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:36,500
YES, BONES.

625
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,709
DON'T LET HER TOUCH ME.
SHE'LL DIE.

626
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,458
JIM...

627
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:46,667
I CAN'T DESTROY LIFE,

628
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:49,375
EVEN IF IT'S
TO SAVE MY OWN.

629
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:52,417
I CAN'T. NOW, YOU KNOW THAT.

630
00:44:52,417 --> 00:44:54,834
I CAN'T LET YOU DO IT.

631
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,083
CAPTAIN.

632
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:02,667
WHAT IS IT?

633
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,083
THE INTENSITY
OF EMOTION

634
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:05,583
IS DRAINING US

635
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:08,041
AND BUILDING UP
THE FORCE FIELD.

636
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,625
YES, I KNOW.

637
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:12,000
IT DRAWS ITS ENERGY
FROM US, CAPTAIN.

638
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,875
IN SPITE OF
WHAT WE SEE,

639
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,583
ALL EMOTION
MUST BE SUPPRESSED.

640
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,041
THAT MIGHT WEAKEN
THE FIELD.

641
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:21,208
I'LL TRY.

642
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,333
YES.

643
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,208
SPOCK.

644
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,625
YOU CANNOT USE OUR POWERS
TO CHANGE WHAT IS HAPPENING.

645
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:00,500
YOU MUST SAVE THE LIFE
OF OUR FRIEND.

646
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,709
NO.

647
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:03,291
WE WILL NOT.

648
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:08,917
HER INSTINCT MUST BE
DEVELOPED TO THE FULLEST.

649
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:11,250
THE TEST MUST BE COMPLETE.

650
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,792
IT IS COMPLETE.

651
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:15,417
GEM HAS EARNED
THE RIGHT OF SURVIVAL
FOR HER PLANET.

652
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:17,000
SHE OFFERED HER LIFE.

653
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,500
TO OFFER IS NOT
PROOF ENOUGH.

654
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,166
IF DEATH IS ALL
YOU UNDERSTAND...

655
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:25,083
HERE ARE 4 LIVES
FOR YOU.

656
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,750
WE WILL NOT LEAVE
OUR FRIEND.

657
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,792
YOU'VE LOST THE CAPACITY

658
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,208
TO FEEL THE EMOTIONS
YOU BROUGHT GEM HERE
TO EXPERIENCE.

659
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:42,000
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT IS TO LIVE.

660
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:47,333
LOVE AND COMPASSION
ARE DEAD IN YOU.

661
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:48,583
YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT INTELLECT.

662
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:47,500
FAREWELL.

663
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:10,542
STRANGE.

664
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:11,917
WHAT IS PUZZLING YOU,
CAPTAIN?

665
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:13,750
I'M NOT PUZZLED,
MR. SPOCK. I AM...

666
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:17,291
AWED.

667
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:19,709
I'M WITH YOU,
CAPTAIN.
SHE AWED ME.

668
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:23,000
NO, NO. I WASN'T
THINKING OF GEM.

669
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,834
I WAS THINKING
OF THAT FANTASTIC
ELEMENT OF CHANCE

670
00:48:25,834 --> 00:48:27,792
THAT OUT IN LIMITLESS SPACE

671
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:29,250
WE SHOULD COME TOGETHER
WITH GEM.

672
00:48:30,417 --> 00:48:32,417
CAPTAIN,
THE ELEMENT OF CHANCE

673
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:34,959
CAN VIRTUALLY BE ELIMINATED
BY A CIVILIZATION

674
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:36,792
AS ADVANCED AS THE VIANS.

675
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,750
NOT TO DISPUTE
YOUR COMPUTER,
MR. SPOCK,

676
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,792
BUT FROM WHAT LITTLE
YOU'VE TOLD ME,

677
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,542
I WOULD SAY THAT
SHE WAS A PEARL
OF GREAT PRICE.

678
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:45,917
WHAT, SCOTT?

679
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:48,375
DO YOU NOT KNOW
THE STORY OF
THE MERCHANT?

680
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:53,959
THE MERCHANT.

681
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:56,667
WHO, WHEN HE
FOUND ONE PEARL
OF GREAT PRICE,

682
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,709
WENT AND SOLD
ALL THAT HE HAD

683
00:48:58,709 --> 00:48:59,959
AND BOUGHT IT.

684
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:02,000
YES, SHE WAS ALL THAT.

685
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,333
BUT WHETHER THE VIANS
BOUGHT HER OR FOUND HER

686
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:07,125
MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE.
SHE WAS OF GREAT VALUE.

687
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:09,750
WELL, PERSONALLY,
I FIND IT FASCINATING

688
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,834
THAT WITH ALL THEIR
SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE

689
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:13,417
AND ADVANCES,

690
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,458
THAT IT WAS GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED HUMAN EMOTION

691
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:17,750
THAT THEY VALUED THE MOST.

692
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:21,041
PERHAPS THE VULCANS
SHOULD HEAR
ABOUT THIS.

693
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,625
MR. SPOCK, CAN YOU BE
PREVAILED UPON

694
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:25,333
TO BRING THEM THE NEWS?

695
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:26,667
POSSIBLY, CAPTAIN.

696
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:28,875
I SHALL CERTAINLY
GIVE THE THOUGHT

697
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:31,417
ALL THE CONSIDERATION
IT IS DUE.

698
00:49:35,709 --> 00:49:38,333
MR. SULU,
AHEAD WARP FACTOR 2.

699
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:39,667
AYE, AYE, SIR.
WARP FACTOR 2.
