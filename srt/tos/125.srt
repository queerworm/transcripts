1
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,195
WHO'S THERE?

2
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,447
IT'S YOUR RELIEF, SAM.

3
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,580
ALL QUIET?

4
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:39,915
DIDN'T SEE
A THING, CHIEF.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,876
NOBODY EVER DOES.

6
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,795
WHATEVER THE THING IS,
IT'S ALREADY KILLED
50 PEOPLE.

7
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,174
I NEVER REALIZED BEFORE
HOW DARK IT IS DOWN HERE.

8
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,843
STAY ON YOUR TOES,
SCHMITTER.

9
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,720
KEEP YOUR PHASER
IN YOUR HAND
AT ALL TIMES.

10
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,179
WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO?

11
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,389
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED
TO ED APPEL

12
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,725
WHEN HE TOOK A SHOT
AT THE THING.

13
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,267
HOW ABOUT ALL THOSE
OTHER PEOPLE,

14
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,895
BEFORE THE MONSTER
GOT THEM?

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,396
I'M SORRY, SCHMITTER,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,

16
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,523
BUT WE'VE GOT
TO HAVE GUARDS.

17
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,025
OK, CHIEF.

18
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,320
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

19
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,947
KEEP ALERT.

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,491
IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING OR
SEE ANYTHING, CALL IN.

21
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,577
SOMEBODY CAN BE HERE
IN 3 MINUTES.

22
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,328
A LOT CAN HAPPEN
IN 3 MINUTES.

23
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,124
CHIEF, IS IT TRUE
THE "ENTERPRISE"
IS ON ITS WAY?

24
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,919
IT'S COMING.

25
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,086
YOU THINK IT COULD GET HERE
IN THE NEXT 4 HOURS?

26
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,547
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

27
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,618
[FIERY NOISE]

28
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,705
NO.

29
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,749
AAH!

30
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:04,750
COME ON.

31
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,627
AAH...

32
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,843
SCHMITTER.

33
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,014
LIKE THE REST OF THEM.

34
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,016
BURNED TO A CRISP.

35
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:33,112
Kirk: SPACE--THE FINAL FRONTIER.

36
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:37,074
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES
OF THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

37
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,533
ITS 5-YEAR MISSION--

38
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,578
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

39
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,624
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

40
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,627
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

41
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:26,707
Kirk: CAPTAIN'S LOG--
STARDATE 3196.1.

42
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,291
A DISTRESS CALL
FROM THE PERGIUM

43
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,293
PRODUCTION STATION ON JANUS 6

44
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,378
HAS BROUGHT THE "ENTERPRISE"

45
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,673
TO THAT
LONG-ESTABLISHED COLONY.

46
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,509
MR. SPOCK, DR. McCOY,
AND I HAVE BEAMED DOWN

47
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,428
TO MEET WITH
CHIEF ENGINEER VANDERBERG,

48
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,556
ADMINISTRATIVE HEAD
OF JANUS 6.

49
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,232
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S ASSUME
THERE IS A MONSTER.

50
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,776
WHAT HAS IT DONE?
WHEN DID IT START?

51
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,779
ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO,
WE OPENED UP A NEW LEVEL.

52
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,574
SENSORS GAVE US
AN UNUSUALLY RICH
PERGIUM READING.

53
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,493
NOT ONLY PERGIUM,
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

54
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,245
URANIUM, SERIUM, PLATINUM.

55
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,497
THE WHOLE PLANET'S
LIKE THAT.

56
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,289
IT'S A TREASURE HOUSE.

57
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,417
YES, WE'RE AWARE
OF THAT.

58
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,586
IF MINING CONDITIONS
WEREN'T SO DIFFICULT,

59
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,547
JANUS 6 COULD SUPPLY
THE MINERAL NEEDS
OF A THOUSAND PLANETS.

60
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,716
BUT WHAT HAPPENED?

61
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,510
FIRST, THE AUTOMATIC
MACHINERY, PIECE BY PIECE,

62
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,262
STARTED TO ALMOST
DISINTEGRATE.

63
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,057
METAL BEGAN
DISSOLVING AWAY.

64
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,474
THERE WAS NO REASON
FOR IT,

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,310
AND OUR CHEMISTS
WERE UNABLE TO ANALYZE
THE CORROSIVE AGENT.

66
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,688
I'M SURE THERE
IS AN ANSWER.

67
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,066
IT SIMPLY HAS NOT
YET BEEN DISCOVERED.

68
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,027
YES, IT HAS.

69
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,487
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS
BUTCHERING MONSTER IS,

70
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,614
BUT I KNOW
WHAT IT'S DOING.

71
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,953
OUR MAINTENANCE
ENGINEER SENT DOWN
TO THE DRIFTS

72
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,455
TO REPAIR
THE CORRODED MACHINERY.

73
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,125
WE FOUND THEM...
SEARED TO A CRISP.

74
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,294
VOLCANIC ACTIVITY?

75
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,004
THERE IS NO CURRENT
VOLCANIC ACTIVITY

76
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,005
ON THIS PLANET, CAPTAIN.

77
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,841
HE'S RIGHT. NONE.

78
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,969
AT FIRST, THE DEATHS
WERE DOWN DEEP,

79
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,304
BUT THEY'VE BEEN
MOVING UP TOWARD
OUR LEVELS.

80
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,140
THE LAST MAN
DIED TWO DAYS AGO

81
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,766
3 LEVELS BELOW THIS.

82
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,935
SAME WAY? BURNED?

83
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,020
I'D LIKE
TO EXAMINE THE BODY.

84
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,190
WE KEPT IT FOR YOU.
THERE ISN'T MUCH LEFT.

85
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,483
ROBERTS WILL SHOW YOU.

86
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,739
IT ISN'T PRETTY.

87
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,825
YOU POST
SENTRIES? GUARDS?

88
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,245
OF COURSE. 5 OF THEM
HAVE DIED.

89
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,538
WHO ELSE HAS SEEN THIS?

90
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,208
I HAVE.

91
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,543
THIS IS ED APPEL,
CHIEF PROCESSING
ENGINEER.

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,881
DESCRIBE IT.

93
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,259
I CAN'T.
I ONLY GOT
A GLIMPSE OF IT,

94
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,887
BUT IT'S...
BIG AND SHAGGY.

95
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,222
ED SHOT IT.

96
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,892
OH. YOU MEAN
SHOT AT IT.

97
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,687
NO. I MEAN SHOT IT.
WITH THIS.

98
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,729
FASCINATING.

99
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,815
A GOOD, CLEAN SHOT.

100
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,357
DIDN'T EVEN
SLOW IT DOWN.

101
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,822
WELL, I'VE MADE
MY REPORT TO YOU.

102
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,033
PRODUCTION'S STOPPED,
NOBODY WILL GO INTO
THE LOWER LEVELS,

103
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,202
AND I DON'T BLAME THEM.

104
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,368
IF THE FEDERATION
WANTS PERGIUM,

105
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,496
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

106
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,041
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE,
MR. VANDERBERG.

107
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,876
YOU'RE ALL PRETTY
TOUGH, AREN'T YOU?

108
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,377
STARSHIP,
PHASERBANKS.

109
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,379
WELL, YOU CAN'T
GET YOUR STARSHIP
DOWN IN THE TUNNELS.

110
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,049
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO,
MR. APPEL.

111
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,301
MR. VANDERBERG,
I'LL NEED A COMPLETE
SUBSURFACE CHART

112
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,011
OF ALL THE DRIFTS,
GALLERIES, TUNNELS.

113
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,554
YOU'LL GET IT.

114
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,973
MR. VANDERBERG,
WHAT IS THIS?

115
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,975
IT'S A SILICON
NODULE.

116
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,227
THERE ARE A
MILLION OF THEM
ARE DOWN THERE.

117
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,602
NO COMMERCIAL
VALUE.

118
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,856
BUT A GEOLOGICAL ODDITY,
TO SAY THE LEAST.

119
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,107
PURE SILICON?

120
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,026
A FEW TRACE ELEMENTS.

121
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,195
LOOK, WE DIDN'T
CALL YOU HERE SO YOU
COULD COLLECT ROCKS.

122
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,445
THANK YOU,
MR. VANDERBERG.

123
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,157
WE'LL NEED YOUR
COMPLETE COOPERATION.

124
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,700
YOU'LL HAVE IT.

125
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,202
JUST FIND
THAT CREATURE,
WHATEVER IT IS.

126
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,913
I'VE GOT A QUOTA
TO MEET.

127
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,206
COME ON, APPEL.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,377
VAST NUMBER OF TUNNELS
IS NOT GONNA MAKE

129
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,419
OUR HUNTING ANY EASIER.
DOC?

130
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,256
SCHMITTER DIDN'T
BURN TO DEATH, JIM,

131
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,006
NOT IN THE USUAL
SENSE, ANYWAY.

132
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,632
EXPLAIN THAT.

133
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,133
WELL, THERE ARE
ONLY FRAGMENTS

134
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,426
OF BONE AND TEETH LEFT,

135
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:11,390
BUT THE PLANT'S PHYSICIAN
AGREES WITH ME--
A CHEMICAL CORROSION...

136
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,308
ALMOST AS IF HE'D BEEN
THROWN INTO A VAT

137
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,686
OF EXTREMELY
CORROSIVE ACID.

138
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,980
STRONG ENOUGH
TO EAT MACHINERY?

139
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,524
STRONG ENOUGH TO EAT
ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN THINK OF.

140
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,321
MR. SPOCK.

141
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,739
I'VE CHARTED
THE POSITIONS

142
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,158
OF THE DEATHS
AND THE ACTS
OF SABOTAGE.

143
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,744
HERE, HERE,
AND HERE.

144
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,246
IF THE TIMES
OF THESE INCIDENTS

145
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,538
ARE TO BE ACCEPTED
AS ACCURATE,

146
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,957
THE CREATURE WOULD
HAVE TO HAVE MOVED

147
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,583
AT AN INCREDIBLE
RATE OF SPEED.

148
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,834
MM-HMM.
MR. VANDERBERG,

149
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,753
HOW RECENT ARE
THESE CHARTS?

150
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,338
THEY WERE MADE
LAST YEAR.

151
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,757
BEFORE
THE APPEARANCE OF
WHATEVER IT IS?

152
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,217
THAT'S RIGHT.

153
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,176
I SEE.

154
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,470
MR. SPOCK...
GIVE US A REPORT

155
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,679
ON LIFE BENEATH
THE SURFACE.

156
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,308
WITHIN RANGE
OF OUR SENSORS,
THERE IS NO LIFE,

OTHER THAN

158
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,852
OF THIS COLONY
BENEATH THE SURFACE,

159
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,605
UH, AT LEAST, NO
LIFE AS WE KNOW IT.

160
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,233
WE CAN'T COVER
TUNNEL BY TUNNEL
ON FOOT.

161
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,776
WE MUST
GET PRODUCTION
GOING AGAIN.

162
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,570
WE MUST HAVE
THAT PERGIUM!

163
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,572
IF WE COULD FORCE
ANOTHER APPEARANCE
OF THIS CREATURE...

164
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,451
WHEN THAT CREATURE
APPEARS, MEN DIE.

[FIERY NOISE]

166
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,060
AAAAHHHH!

167
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,996
TOO MANY TUNNELS.
WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY.

168
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,623
MR. SPOCK, OUR SENSORS
CAN PICK UP

00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,751
NORMAL LIFE FUNCTIONS
AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE,

170
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,837

ABNORMAL LIFE FUNCTIONS?

HAPPENING IN
THE REACTOR ROOM!

173
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,600
BACK TO YOUR STATIONS.

00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,560
LOOK AT THAT.

175
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,984
I WOULDN'T
TOUCH IT, CAPTAIN.

176
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,487
AN EXTREMELY
ACTIVE CORROSIVE.

177
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,322
TRACES MAY LINGER.

178
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,698
KIRK! QUICKLY!

179
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,831
THE MAIN
CIRCULATING PUMP FOR
THE ENTIRE REACTOR--

180
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,251
IT'S GONE.

181
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,336
SAME INDICATION
AS SHOWN AT THE
DOOR, CAPTAIN--

182
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,421
VERY STRONG
CORROSIVE.

183
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,047
IS THERE A REPLACEMENT
FOR THAT?

184
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,882
NO. NONE.
IT'S OUTDATED.

185
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,175
WE'VE NEVER HAD
ANY TROUBLE WITH IT.

186
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,260
SPOCK, ONBOARD?

187
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,219
NOTHING FOR
A DEVICE

188
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,179
THIS ANTIQUATED,
CAPTAIN.

189
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,431
WITHOUT THE PUMP
MECHANISM,

190
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,266
THE REACTOR WILL
GO SUPERCRITICAL.

191
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,725
IT COULD POISON
HALF THE PLANET.

192
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,601
WE CAN'T
SHUT IT DOWN.

193
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,895
IT PROVIDES
HEAT AND AIR
AND LIFE SUPPORT

194
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,481
FOR THE WHOLE
COLONY.

195
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,110
MR. SPOCK, WE SEEM
TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN
A CHOICE--

196
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,695
DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION...

197
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,406
OR DEATH BY
RADIATION POISONING.

198
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,917
A PXK PERGIUM REACTOR?

199
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,920
NO, SIR. WE DON'T HAVE
ANY SPARE CIRCULATING PUMP

200
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:29,879
FOR A THING LIKE THAT.

201
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,173
I HAVEN'T SEEN
A PXK IN 20 YEARS.

202
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,135
CAN YOU RIG ONE UP?
IT'S VITAL.

203
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,928
WELL, SIR, I CAN
PUT TOGETHER
SOME ODDS AND ENDS,

204
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,097
BUT IT WON'T HOLD
FOR LONG.

205
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,474
HOW LONG?

206
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,850
48 HOURS MAYBE,
WITH A BIT OF LUCK.

207
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,019
48 HOURS IS BETTER
THAN NOTHING.

208
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,062
GET TOGETHER WHAT
YOU NEED AND BEAM

209
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,021
DOWN HERE WITH IT.

210
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,106
TOP PRIORITY.

211
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,567
AYE, CAPTAIN.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.
SCOTT OUT.

212
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,529
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
IT BREAKS DOWN?

213
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,531
HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE
FOUND THE MISSING
PART BY THEN.

214
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,865
HOPEFULLY?
SMALL CHANCE.

215
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,034
WE'LL HAVE TO,
CHIEF.
THE ALTERNATIVE

216
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,829
IS TO EVACUATE
ALL YOU PEOPLE UP
TO THE "ENTERPRISE."

217
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,372
A DOZEN PLANETS
DEPEND ON YOU

218
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,541
FOR PERGIUM
FOR THEIR REACTOR.

219
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,917
THEY'RE ALREADY
SCREAMING.

220
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,377
REACTORS
CLOSING DOWN, LIFE
SUPPORT SYSTEMS--

221
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,630
I'M CONCERNED
WITH MY PEOPLE
RIGHT HERE KIRK--

222
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,423
THEY'RE BEING MURDERED.

223
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,383
YOU FIND THAT MONSTER
AND KILL IT.

224
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,802
THE MISSING PUMP
WAS NOT TAKEN
BY ACCIDENT.

225
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,679
IT WAS THE ONE PIECE
OF EQUIPMENT
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL

226
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,307
FOR THE OPERATION
OF THE REACTOR.

227
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,517
DO YOU THINK
THE CREATURE

228
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,894
IS TRYING TO PUSH
THE COLONISTS
OFF THE PLANET?

229
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,937
IT WOULD SEEM SO.

230
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,689
BUT WHY NOW, MR. SPOCK?
THESE PRODUCTION FACILITIES

231
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,026
HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION
FOR OVER 50 YEARS.

232
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,321
I DON'T KNOW.

233
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,448
BUT THERE IS
A POSSIBILITY.

234
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,075
WHAT'S THAT?

235
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,581
LIFE AS WE KNOW IT

236
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:50,460
IS UNIVERSALLY BASED
ON SOME COMBINATION
OF CARBON COMPOUNDS.

237
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,134
BUT WHAT IF LIFE EXISTS
BASED ON ANOTHER ELEMENT?

238
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,302
FOR INSTANCE...

239
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,803
SILICON?

240
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,723
YOU'RE CREATING
FANTASIES, MR. SPOCK.

241
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,978
NOT NECESSARILY, BONES.
I'VE HEARD OF THE
THEORETICAL POSSIBILITY

242
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,522
OF LIFE BASED
ON SILICON,

243
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,316
BUT SILICON-BASED LIFE
WOULD BE OF AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT ORDER.

244
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,362
IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT OUR PHASERS

245
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,196
MIGHT NOT AFFECT IT.

246
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,656
CERTAINLY NOT PHASER ONE,

247
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,243
WHICH IS FAR LESS
POWERFUL THAN PHASER TWO.

248
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,452
ALL RIGHT.

249
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,830
HOW ABOUT THIS--

250
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,959
A CREATURE THAT LIVES DEEP
IN THE PLANET BELOW US,

251
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,961
AT HOME IN SOLID ROCK.

252
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,339
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE,

253
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:40,176
IT WOULD HAVE TO
HAVE SOME FORM
OF NATURAL ARMOR PLATING.

254
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,262
IT COULD EXPLAIN MUCH,

255
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,889
ESPECIALLY SINCE
THE COLONISTS ARE ARMED
ONLY WITH PHASER I.

256
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:45,932
BUT OUR PEOPLE HAVE
PHASER NUMBER TWO.

257
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,935
WHICH I COULD ADJUST
TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE
AGAINST SILICON.

258
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,398
SILICON-BASED LIFE
IS PHYSIOLOGICALLY
IMPOSSIBLE,

259
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,442
ESPECIALLY IN
AN OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE.

260
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,530
IT MAY BE, DOCTOR,
THAT THE CREATURE
CAN EXIST

261
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,324
FOR BRIEF PERIODS
IN SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE

262
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,619
BEFORE RETURNING
TO ITS OWN ENVIRONMENT.

263
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,746
I STILL THINK
YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS.

264
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,455
YOU MAY
BE RIGHT, DOCTOR,

265
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,582
BUT AT LEAST IT'S
SOMETHING TO GO ON.

266
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,375
MR. SPOCK,
HAVE LIEUTENANT
COMMANDER GIOTTO

267
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,210
ASSEMBLE
THE SECURITY TROOPS

268
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,212
AND ARM THEM WITH
PHASER NUMBER TWO.

269
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,796
YOU MAKE THE PROPER
ADJUSTMENTS.

270
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,313
YOU SEEM FASCINATED
BY THIS ROCK.

271
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,317
YES, CAPTAIN.

272
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,279
YOU RECALL THAT
VANDERBERG COMMENTED

273
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,991
THERE WERE
THOUSANDS OF THESE
AT A LOWER LEVEL--

274
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,410
THE LEVEL WHICH
THE MACHINERY OPENED

275
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,622
JUST PRIOR
TO THE FIRST APPEARANCE
OF THE CREATURE.

276
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,581
DO THEY TIE IN?

277
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,168
I DON'T KNOW.

278
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,377
SPECULATE.

279
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,594
I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN
DR. McCOY SUFFICIENT
CAUSE FOR AMUSEMENT.

280
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,555
I WOULD PREFER TO COGITATE
THE POSSIBILITIES
FOR A TIME.

281
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,015
A SHORT TIME,
MR. SPOCK.

282
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,850
WE HAVE VERY LITTLE.

283
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,064
HOW'S IT GOING,
SCOTTY?

284
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,608
WELL, SIR, IT'S
A PLUMBER'S NIGHTMARE,

285
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:19,442
BUT IT'LL HOLD
FOR A BIT.

286
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,819
IT HAS TO HOLD
LONGER THAN
A BIT.

287
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,695
[BEEP BEEP]

288
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,446
I'M SORRY, SIR.
THAT'S ABOUT
THE BEST I CAN DO,

289
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,239
AND I GUARANTEE
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

290
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,407
KIRK HERE.

291
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,034
Spock: CAPTAIN,

HAVE GATHERED

292
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,327
IN CHIEF VANDERBERG'S
OFFICE.

293
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,912
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
KIRK OUT.

294
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,790
SCOTTY,
RIDE HERD ON IT.

295
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,625
KIND WORDS.
TENDER, LOVING CARE.

296
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,627
KISS IT. BABY IT.
FLATTER IT
IF YOU HAVE TO,

297
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,712
BUT KEEP IT GOING.

298
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,421
I'LL DO WHAT
I CAN, SIR.

299
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,382
YOU'LL PROCEED
FROM LEVEL TO LEVEL,

300
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,092
CHECKING OUT
EVERY FOOT OF OPENING.

301
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,805
YOU ARE SEARCHING
FOR SOME SORT
OF CREATURE

302
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,140
WHICH IS HIGHLY RESISTANT
TO PHASER FIRE.

303
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,768
PHASERS WILL BE SET
ON MAXIMUM,
AND REMEMBER THIS--

304
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,770
50 PEOPLE HAVE DIED.
I WANT NO MORE DEATHS.

305
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,772
EXCEPT
THE BLOODY THING.

306
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,066
THE CREATURE
MAY OR MAY NOT
ATTACK ON SIGHT.

307
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,275
HOWEVER, YOU MUST.

308
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,736
IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT

309
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:06,906
THAT WE GET THIS INSTALLATION
BACK INTO PRODUCTION.

310
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,533
MR. VANDERBERG,
MAY I ASK
AT WHICH LEVEL

311
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,619
YOU DISCOVERED
THE NODULES
OF SILICON?

312
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,079
THE 23rd. WHY?

313
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,457
COMMANDER GIOTTO,
TAKE YOUR DETAIL.

314
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,958
GO DIRECTLY TO
THE 23rd LEVEL.

315
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,627
START YOUR SEARCH THERE.

316
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:20,336
AYE AYE, SIR.

317
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,755
MAY I ASK
IF YOU HAVE REASON

318
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,549
TO SUSPECT THIS
CREATURE MAY BE
ON THAT LEVEL?

319
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,843
IT'S ONE OF
THE POSSIBILITIES
WE'VE DISCUSSED.

320
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,553
I WANT YOUR PEOPLE
TO STAY ON THE TOP LEVEL,

321
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,054
TOGETHER AND AT
A SAFE PLACE.

322
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,432
I DON'T KNOW ANY
SAFE PLACE, CAPTAIN,

323
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,267
THE WAY THAT THING
COMES AND GOES.

324
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:36,936
WELL, GENTLEMEN,
YOU HAVE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.

325
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,187
LET'S GET AT IT.

326
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,938
[SENSOR TONE]

327
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,983
MR. SPOCK?

328
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,025
FIND SOMETHING?

329
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,444

330
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,028
TO REGISTER FOR
SILICON, CAPTAIN.

[SENSOR TONE CONTINUES]

332
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,576

00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,639
NO, SIR.

00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,376
AAAAAHHHH!

340
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,724
HE NEVER EVEN HAD
A CHANCE TO FIRE,
CAPTAIN.

341
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,976
IT'S ONLY
BEEN SECONDS SINCE
WE HEARD HIM SCREAM.

342
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,644
THE CREATURE MUST
STILL BE AROUND.

343
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,502

344
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,841
THIS TUNNEL.

00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,718
MY READINGS
INDICATE IT WAS MADE
WITHIN THE HOUR,

346
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:14,802
MOMENTS AGO,
IN FACT.

347
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,637
ARE YOU CERTAIN?
POSITIVE.

348
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,848
THIS TUNNEL GOES BACK
AS FAR AS THE EYE
CAN SEE.

349
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,683
OUR BEST MACHINERY
COULDN'T CUT A TUNNEL
LIKE THIS.

350
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,475
NOT EVEN
WITH PHASERS.

351
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,896
INDEED, CAPTAIN.
I'M QUITE AT A LOSS.

352
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,065
[FIERY NOISE]

353
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,207
GET DOWN.

354
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,834
DISAPPEARED.

355
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,294
ASTONISHING THAT
ANYTHING OF THAT BULK

356
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,046
COULD MOVE
SO RAPIDLY.

357
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,505
THESE WALLS ARE HOT.

358
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,131
INDEED.

359
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,716
THIS TUNNEL
WAS CUT

360
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,301
WITHIN THE LAST
TWO MINUTES.

361
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,844
YOU ALL RIGHT,
CAPTAIN?

362
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,804
YES. PERFECTLY.

363
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:58,471
DID YOU
SEE IT, SIR?

364
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,514
YES, WE SAW
WHERE DOES
THE TUNNEL GO?

365
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,683
READINGS INDICATE
A MAZE OF TUNNELS

366
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,644
OF THIS
GENERAL CATEGORY
IN THAT DIRECTION.

367
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,145
DID YOU GET A SHOT
AT IT?

368
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,521
YES. WE TOOK
A BITE OUT OF IT.

369
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,614
NOT ANIMAL TISSUE.

370
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,324
WHAT IS IT?

371
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,867
CLOSEST APPROXIMATION
I COULD COME TO

372
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,036
WOULD BE
FIBROUS ASBESTOS,

373
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,245
A MINERAL, CAPTAIN.

374
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,872
THEN YOUR GUESS
WAS RIGHT.

375
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,499
IT WOULD SEEM SO.

376
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,167
SILICON-BASED.

377
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,877
SUMMATION.

378
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,004
WE ARE DEALING WITH
A SILICON CREATURE

379
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,755
OF THE DEEP ROCKS,

380
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,214
CAPABLE OF MOVING
THROUGH SOLID ROCK

381
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,009
AS EASILY AS WE MOVE
THROUGH THE AIR.

382
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,343
THAT WOULD
ACCOUNT FOR
THE TUNNELS.

383
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,679
CORRECT.
THIS CREATURE'S BODY

384
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,140
SECRETES AN EXTREMELY
POWERFUL CORROSIVE.

385
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,143
POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO DISSOLVE THE DOOR
OF THE REACTOR CHAMBER.

386
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,560
AND IT EXPLAINS
THE MURDERED MEN.

387
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,482
IT'S DEFINITELY
PHASER RESISTANT.

388
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,861
WE HAD OUR WEAPONS
SET FOR SILICON
AND ON FULL POWER,

389
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,654
YET WE ONLY
DAMAGED IT.
IT STILL LIVES.

390
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,114
MEANING IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE TO KILL?

391
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,367
NO. NO,
IT MIGHT REQUIRE
AMASSED PHASERS.

392
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,037
OR A SINGLE PHASER
WITH MUCH LONGER CONTACT.

393
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,245
COMMANDER...

394
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,249
PASS THIS ON
TO YOUR MEN--

395
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,626
WE KNEW
IT WAS A KILLER.

396
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,586
NOW IT'S WOUNDED...

397
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,754
PROBABLY IN PAIN

398
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,590
SOMEWHERE
BACK THERE.

399
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,844
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE DANGEROUS THAN
A WOUNDED ANIMAL.

400
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,224
COMMANDER GIOTTO.

401
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,809
INSTRUCT YOUR MEN TO
CONCENTRATE THE SEARCH

402
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,977
IN THIS SECTOR.

403
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,436
REMIND THEM
THE CREATURE
IS WOUNDED.

404
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,855
AYE, AYE, SIR.

405
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,152
WHAT IS IT, SPOCK?

406
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,236
I'VE RUN A COMPLETE
SPHERICAL CHECK

407
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,988
ON ALL
LIFE FORMS, CAPTAIN,

408
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,656
RADIUS 100 MILES.

409
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,282
I'VE LOCATED OUR MEN,
ALL OF THEM,

410
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,451
AND I'VE LOCATED
ONE CREATURE

411
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,538
MOVING RAPIDLY
THROUGH NATIVE ROCK,
BEARING 201.

412
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,873
AND THAT IS ALL.

413
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,541
ONE CREATURE
IN 100 MILES?

414
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,085
EXACTLY.

415
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,587
CAPTAIN,
THERE ARE LITERALLY
THOUSANDS OF THESE TUNNELS

416
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,255
IN THIS GENERAL
AREA ALONE,

417
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,091
FAR TOO MANY TO BE CUT
BY THE ONE CREATURE

418
00:20:58,216 --> 00:20:59,299
IN AN ORDINARY
LIFETIME.

419
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,385
THEN WE'RE
DEALING WITH MORE
THAN ONE CREATURE,

420
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,261
DESPITE YOUR
TRICORDER READINGS,

421
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,346
OR WE HAVE
A CREATURE

422
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,224
WITH AN EXTREMELY
LONG LIFE SPAN.

423
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,268
OR IT IS THE LAST
OF A RACE OF CREATURES

424
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,811
WHICH MADE THESE TUNNELS.

425
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:15,191
IF SO, IF IT IS
THE ONLY SURVIVOR
OF A DEAD RACE,

426
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,444
TO KILL IT WOULD BE
A CRIME AGAINST SCIENCE.

427
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,576
MR. SPOCK...

428
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,369
OUR MISSION IS
TO PROTECT THIS COLONY,

429
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,537
TO GET THE PERGIUM
MOVING AGAIN.

430
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,497
THIS IS NOT A
ZOOLOGICAL EXPEDITION.

431
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,378
MAINTAIN A CONSTANT
READING ON THE CREATURE.

432
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,672
IF WE HAVE TO,
WE'LL USE PHASERS
TO CUT OUR OWN TUNNELS.

433
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,590
WE'LL TRY
TO SURROUND IT.

434
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,555
I'M SORRY, MR. SPOCK,

435
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,474
BUT I'M AFRAID
THE CREATURE MUST DIE.

436
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,812
I SEE NO ALTERNATIVE
MYSELF, CAPTAIN.

437
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,731
IT MERELY SEEMS A PITY.

438
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,691
THE SEARCH TEAM IS
GATHERING IN THE MAIN TUNNEL.

439
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,359
GOOD.

440
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:03,864
SO IT IS WOUNDED, AND THEREFORE
TWICE AS DANGEROUS.

441
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,825
STAY IN PAIRS.

442
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,410
IF YOU SEE IT,
CONCENTRATE YOUR PHASER FIRE

443
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,663
AT WHAT APPEARS
TO BE ITS HEAD.

444
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,957
CONCENTRATE IT.
MAINTAIN IT.

445
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,084
IT IS DEFINITELY RESISTANT,
BUT IT CAN BE HURT.

446
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,502
AND IF IT CAN BE HURT,
IT CAN BE KILLED.

447
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,920
MISTER SPOCK.

448
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,506
GENTLEMEN, IF YOU'LL
EXAMINE YOUR CHARTS,
PLEASE.

449
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,257
I LAST LOCATED
THE CREATURE

450
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,176
IN THE AREA
MARKED ATTIT-26

451
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:26,262
MOVING IN BEARING 201.

452
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,388
THIS PARTICULAR GROUP
WILL MOVE OUT
BEYOND THAT AREA

453
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,224
IN ALL DIRECTIONS
IN AN EFFORT

454
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,601
TO SURROUND IT,
POSSIBLY CAPTURE IT.

455
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,438
YOUR ORDERS ARE
SHOOT TO KILL.

456
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,774
PROTECT YOURSELF
AT ALL TIMES.

457
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,902
COMMANDER GIOTTO,
DISPERSE YOUR
SEARCH PARTIES.

458
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,154
AYE, AYE, SIR.

459
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,489
LOUIS, VINZI,
TAKE YOUR MEN OUT.

460
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,991
MR. SPOCK.

461
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,205
CAPTURE IT?
I DON'T RECALL GIVING
ANY SUCH ORDER.

462
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,249
YOU DID NOT, SIR.
I MERELY THOUGHT THAT IF
THE OPPORTUNITY AROSE--

463
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,543
I WILL LOSE
NO MORE MEN.

464
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,794
THE CREATURE WILL
BE KILLED ON SIGHT

465
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,588
AND THAT'S
THE END OF IT.

466
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,715
VERY WELL, SIR.

467
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,425
MR. SPOCK.

468
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,136
I WANT YOU
TO ASSIST SCOTTY

469
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,596
IN MAINTAINING
THAT MAKESHIFT
CIRCULATING PUMP.

470
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,809
I--I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR?

471
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,813
YOU HEARD ME. IT'S
VITAL THAT WE KEEP THAT
REACTOR IN OPERATION.

472
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,856
YOUR SCIENTIFIC
KNOWLEDGE--

473
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,649
IS NOT NEEDED THERE, SIR.

474
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,276
MR. SCOTT HAS
FAR MORE KNOWLEDGE

475
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,153
OF NUCLEAR REACTORS
THAN I DO.

476
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,364
YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT.

477
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,157
MR. SPOCK, YOU
ARE SECOND IN COMMAND.

478
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,117
THIS WILL BE
A DANGEROUS HUNT.

479
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,703
EITHER ONE OF US
BY HIMSELF
IS EXPENDABLE.

480
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,080
BOTH OF US ARE NOT.

481
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,749
CAPTAIN, THERE ARE
APPROXIMATELY 100 OF US

482
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:40,253
ENGAGED IN THIS SEARCH
AGAINST ONE CREATURE.

483
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:46,759
THE ODDS AGAINST
YOU AND I BOTH BEING
KILLED ARE 2,228.7 TO 1.

484
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:52,598
2,228.7 TO 1?

485
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,519
THOSE ARE
PRETTY GOOD ODDS,
MR. SPOCK.

486
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,272
AND THEY ARE
OF COURSE ACCURATE,
CAPTAIN.

487
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,522
OF COURSE.

488
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,192
WELL, I HATE
TO USE THE WORD,

489
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:07,696
BUT LOGICALLY,
WITH THOSE KIND
OF ODDS,

490
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,657
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
STAY.

491
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,493
BUT PLEASE STAY
OUT OF TROUBLE,
MR. SPOCK.

492
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,537
THAT IS ALWAYS
MY INTENTION, CAPTAIN.

493
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,125
[BEEP BEEP]

494
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,585
KIRK HERE.

495
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,003
SCOTTY HERE, CAPTAIN.

496
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,755
MY BRILLIANT IMPROVISATION
JUST GAVE UP THE GHOST.

497
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,924
IT COULDN'T
STAND THE STRAIN.

498
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:27,549
CAN YOU
FIX IT AGAIN?

499
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,428
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.
IT'S GONE FOR GOOD.

500
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,470
START IMMEDIATE
EVACUATION OF
ALL COLONISTS

501
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,889
TO THE "ENTERPRISE."

502
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,141
NOT ALL, CAPTAIN.

503
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,351
I AND SOME OF MY
KEY PERSONNEL ARE STAYING.

504
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,476
WE'LL BE DOWN
TO JOIN YOU.

505
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,104
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
PHASERS FOR YOU.

506
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,939
THEN WE'LL USE CLUBS.

507
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,566
WE'RE NOT BEING CHASED
AWAY FROM HERE.
WE'RE STAYING.

508
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,945
GOOD. GET EVERYBODY ELSE
ABOARD THE "ENTERPRISE."

509
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,863
THE FEWER PEOPLE WE HAVE
BREATHING THE AIR
DOWN HERE,

510
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,240
THE LONGER
THE REST OF US WILL BE
ABLE TO HOLD OUT.

511
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,950
HOW MUCH LONGER, SCOTTY?

512
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,368
THE REACTOR WILL
GO SUPERCRITICAL

513
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,453
IN ABOUT
10 HOURS, SIR.

514
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,079
YOU HAVE THAT
LONG TO FIND

00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,573
STRIKE BACK!

691
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,619
MONSTERS!

692
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,543
WHAT IN THE NAME OF...

693
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,974
WHAT IS SPOCK DOING?

694
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,850
IT'S WOUNDED--BADLY.
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP IT.

695
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,061
HELP THAT?

696
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,271
GO TAKE A LOOK.

697
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,031
Spock:
THE END OF LIFE...

698
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,368
MURDERERS.

699
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,264
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

700
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,474
THAT THING IS VIRTUALLY
MADE OUT OF STONE!

701
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,726
HELP IT. TREAT IT.

702
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,854
I'M A DOCTOR,
NOT A BRICKLAYER.

703
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,396
YOU'RE A HEALER.
THERE'S A PATIENT.

704
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,523
THAT'S AN ORDER.

705
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,035
MR. SPOCK...

706
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,580
TELL IT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP.

707
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,628
THE MECHANISM.

708
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,090
UNDERSTOOD.

709
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,596
IS THE END OF LIFE...

710
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,561
ETERNITY STOPS...

711
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,984
GO OUT...

712
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,361
INTO THE TUNNEL.

713
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:12,451
TO THE CHAMBER...
OF THE AGES.

714
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:24,005
CRY FOR
THE CHILDREN.

715
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:32,305
WALK CAREFULLY

716
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,308
IN THE VAULT
OF TOMORROW.

717
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:47,279
SORROW FOR
THE MURDERED
CHILDREN.

718
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,172
THE THING YOU
SEARCH FOR IS THERE.

719
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,759
GO.

720
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,469
GO.

721
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,182
SADNESS.

722
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,104
SADNESS...

723
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,815
FOR THE END OF THINGS.

724
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,487
GO...

725
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,571
INTO THE TUNNEL.

726
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:36,119
THERE IS A PASSAGEWAY.

727
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,996
QUICKLY, QUICKLY.

728
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,756
THE CAPTAIN SAID FOR YOU
TO WAIT HERE,

729
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,924
AND HERE IS WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA WAIT.

730
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,884
THAT MURDERING
MONSTER'S IN THERE

731
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,303
AND WE'RE GOING TO
GO IN THERE AND KILL IT.

732
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,595
YOU'RE GOING
TO STAY HERE.

733
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,599
THAT'S RIGHT, LIEUTENANT.

734
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,394
JUST BEAM IT DOWN
TO ME IMMEDIATELY,

735
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,103
AND NEVER MIND
WHAT I WANT IT FOR.

736
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,647
I JUST WANT IT!
NOW MOVE!

737
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,111
IT IS TIME...

738
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,321
TO SLEEP.

739
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,450
IT IS OVER.

740
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,912
FAILURE.

741
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,584
THE MURDERERS...

742
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,045
HAVE WON.

743
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,589
DEATH IS WELCOME.

744
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,720
LET IT END...

745
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:18,721
HERE.

746
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,597
MR. SPOCK...

747
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:23,851
MR. SPOCK...

748
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,644
SPOCK...

749
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,105
SPOCK...

750
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,273
COME OUT OF IT.

751
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,288
I FOUND THE UNIT
IN THERE.

752
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,873
IT'S
IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.

753
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,460
I ALSO FOUND ABOUT
A MILLION OF THESE...

754
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,378
SILICON NODULES.

755
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:51,837
THEY'RE EGGS,
AREN'T THEY?

756
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,631
YES, CAPTAIN, EGGS...

757
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,217
AND ABOUT TO HATCH.

758
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,178
MINERS MUST HAVE BROKEN
INTO THE HATCHERY.

759
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:03,182
THEIR OPERATIONS
DESTROYED THOUSANDS.

760
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,100
NO WONDER.

761
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,269
THERE. THEY'RE COMING.

762
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:12,609
ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO!

763
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,194
COME ON.

764
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,863
HOW ARE YOU DOING, DOC?

765
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,241
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

766
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:24,036
[RUNNING FOOTSTEPS]

767
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,622
NO, DON'T FIRE.

768
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,289
KILL IT!

769
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,542
FIRST MAN THAT FIRES
IS DEAD.

770
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,710
THAT THING HAS KILLED
50 OF MY MEN.

771
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,046
YOU'VE KILLED THOUSANDS
OF HER CHILDREN.

772
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,548
WHAT?

773
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,758
THOSE ROUND SILICON
NODULES YOU'VE BEEN

774
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,469
COLLECTING
AND DESTROYING?

775
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:40,761
THEY'RE HER EGGS.

776
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:45,975
TELL THEM, MR. SPOCK.

777
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,562
THERE HAVE BEEN
MANY GENERATIONS
OF HORTA ON THIS PLANET.

778
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,565
EVERY 50,000 YEARS,
THE ENTIRE RACE DIES,

779
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:55,318
ALL BUT ONE,
LIKE THIS ONE,

780
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:56,861
BUT THE EGGS LIVE.

781
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:57,945
SHE CARES FOR THEM...

782
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,696
PROTECTS THEM.

783
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,199
AND WHEN THEY HATCH,

784
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:04,661
SHE IS THE MOTHER TO THEM,
THOUSANDS OF THEM.

785
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,621
THIS CREATURE HERE IS
THE MOTHER OF HER RACE.

786
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:12,460
THE HORTA IS INTELLIGENT...
PEACEFUL...

787
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,711
MILD.

788
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,881
SHE HAD NO OBJECTION
TO SHARING THIS PLANET
WITH YOU,

789
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:17,965
TILL YOU BROKE
INTO HER NURSERY

790
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,426
AND STARTED
DESTROYING HER EGGS.

791
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:22,637
THEN SHE FOUGHT BACK
THE ONLY WAY SHE KNEW HOW,

792
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:27,433
AS ANY MOTHER WOULD FIGHT
WHEN HER CHILDREN
ARE IN DANGER.

793
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,062
WE DIDN'T KNOW.
HOW COULD WE?

794
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,480
YOU MEAN,
IF THESE EGGS HATCH,

795
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,273
THERE'LL BE THOUSANDS
OF THOSE THINGS

796
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,275
CRAWLING AROUND
DOWN HERE?

797
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,734
THIS IS WHERE THEY LIVE.

798
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,779
THEY DIGEST ROCK.
THEY TUNNEL
FOR NOURISHMENT.

799
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,282
AND THEY ARE
THE MOST INOFFENSIVE
OF CREATURES.

800
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,284
THEY HARBOR ILL WILL
TOWARD NO ONE..

801
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,995
LOOK, WE HAVE
PERGIUM TO DELIVER.

802
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,788
YES, I KNOW.

803
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,209
HERE'S YOUR
CIRCULATING PUMP.

804
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:57,338
YOU'VE COMPLAINED
THIS PLANET IS

805
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,090
A MINERALOGICAL
TREASURE HOUSE

806
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:02,093
IF YOU HAD THE EQUIPMENT
TO GET AT IT.

807
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:03,844
GENTLEMEN, THE HORTA
MOVES THROUGH ROCK

808
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:07,390
THE WAY WE MOVE THROUGH
AIR, AND IT LEAVES TUNNELS.

809
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,766
THE GREATEST NATURAL MINERS
IN THE UNIVERSE.

810
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:13,104
IT SEEMS TO ME WE COULD
MAKE AN AGREEMENT,

811
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,189
REACH A MODUS VIVENDI.

812
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:20,361
THEY TUNNEL.
YOU COLLECT AND PROCESS,

813
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,280
AND YOUR PROCESS OPERATION

814
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,616
WOULD BE A THOUSAND TIMES
MORE PROFITABLE.

815
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,040
IT SOUNDS ALL RIGHT
IF IT WILL WORK.

816
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,167
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.

817
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,336
THE HORTA IS
BADLY WOUNDED.

818
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:38,254
IT MAY DIE.

819
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:39,838
IT WON'T DIE!

820
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,173
BY GOLLY, JIM,
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK

821
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,050
I CAN CURE A RAINY DAY.

822
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,176
CAN YOU HELP IT?

823
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,802
HELP IT? I CURED IT.

824
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,138
HOW?

825
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,847
I HAD THE SHIP BEAM DOWN

826
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,433
100 POUNDS OF THAT
THERMAL CONCRETE.

827
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,643
YOU KNOW, THE KIND
WE USE TO BUILD

828
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:53,144
EMERGENCY SHELTERS
OUT OF.

829
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:55,438
IT'S MOSTLY SILICONE.

830
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,149
SO I JUST TROWELED IT
INTO THE WOUND

831
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:01,110
AND IT'LL
ACT LIKE A BANDAGE
UNTIL IT HEALS.

832
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,361
TAKE A LOOK.

833
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,820
IT'S AS GOOD AS NEW.

834
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,239
WELL, SPOCK, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ASK YOU

835
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,158
TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH THE HORTA AGAIN.

836
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:08,825
TELL HER OUR PROPOSITION.

837
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,496
SHE AND HER CHILDREN
CAN DO ALL THE TUNNELING
THEY WANT.

838
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:13,289
OUR PEOPLE WILL
REMOVE THE MINERALS,

839
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,916
AND EACH SIDE WILL
LEAVE THE OTHER ALONE.

840
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,460
THINK SHE'LL GO FOR IT?

841
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,003
IT SEEMS LOGICAL,
CAPTAIN.

842
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,506
THE HORTA HAS
A VERY LOGICAL MIND.

843
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:23,966
AND AFTER
CLOSE ASSOCIATION
WITH HUMANS,

844
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,636
I FIND THAT
CURIOUSLY REFRESHING.

845
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,651
SHIP READY TO LEAVE
ORBIT, CAPTAIN.
COURSE LAID IN.

846
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,152
VERY GOOD,
MR. SPOCK.

847
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,988
CHIEF ENGINEER
VANDERBERG STANDING BY
ON CHANNEL 1.

848
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:46,947
FINE.

849
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,449
YES, CHIEF.
KIRK HERE.

850
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,325
JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU THE EGGS

851
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,952
HAVE STARTED
TO HATCH, CAPTAIN.

852
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,706
FIRST THING
THE LITTLE DEVILS DO
IS START TO TUNNEL.

853
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:57,834
WE'VE ALREADY HIT
HUGE NEW PERGIUM
DEPOSITS.

854
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,461
I'M AFRAID TO TELL
YOU HOW MUCH
GOLD AND PLATINUM

855
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,171
AND RARE EARTHS
WE'VE UNCOVERED.

856
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,215
I'M DELIGHTED
TO HEAR THAT, CHIEF.

857
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,633
ONCE MOTHER HORTA
TELLS HER KIDS
WHAT TO LOOK FOR,

858
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,552
YOU PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE
EMBARRASSINGLY RICH.

859
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:09,261
YOU KNOW, THE HORTA
AREN'T SO BAD

860
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,556
ONCE YOU GET USED
TO THEIR APPEARANCE.

861
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:14,266
THAT'S ABOUT IT, KIRK.
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

862
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:15,852
OUR PLEASURE, CHIEF.
KIRK OUT.

863
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:19,689
CURIOUS.
WHAT CHIEF VANDERBERG
SAID ABOUT THE HORTA

864
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,567
IS EXACTLY WHAT
THE MOTHER HORTA SAID TO ME.

865
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:25,403
SHE FOUND HUMANOID
APPEARANCE REVOLTING,

866
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,238
BUT SHE THOUGHT
SHE COULD GET USED TO IT.

867
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,615
OH, SHE DID,
DID SHE?

868
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:30,408
TELL ME, DID SHE
HAPPEN TO MAKE

869
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:34,078
ANY COMMENT
ABOUT THOSE EARS?

870
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,954
NOT SPECIFICALLY.

871
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,874
BUT I DID GET
THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION

872
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,377
SHE FOUND THEM
THE MOST ATTRACTIVE HUMAN
CHARACTERISTIC OF ALL.

873
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:42,086
I DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART
TO TELL HER

874
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,295
THAT ONLY I HAVE--

875
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,424
SHE REALLY LIKED
THOSE EARS?

876
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:51,136
CAPTAIN, THE HORTA
IS A REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT
AND SENSITIVE CREATURE

877
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,431
WITH IMPECCABLE TASTE.

878
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:54,931
BECAUSE SHE APPROVED
OF YOU.

879
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,726
REALLY, CAPTAIN,
MY MODESTY...

880
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,478
DOES NOT BEAR CLOSE
EXAMINATION, MR. SPOCK.

881
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:03,107
I SUSPECT YOU'RE
BECOMING MORE AND MORE
HUMAN ALL THE TIME.

882
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,316
YOU...

883
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,654
CAPTAIN, I SEE NO REASON
TO STAND HERE
AND BE INSULTED.

884
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,285
AHEAD, WARP FACTOR 2.
