WHAT IS THIS?

80
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:31,563

82

FOR THAT TRANSPORTER

125
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,564
OBVIOUSLY,
THIS REPRESENTS

126
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,607
THE MELKOTIANS' CONCEPT

127
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,026

129
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,948
IT'S JUST BITS
AND PIECES.

00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,866
IT'S INCOMPLETE.

131
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,411
PERHAPS THE MELKOTIANS

132
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,247
HAVE INSUFFICIENT DATA
ABOUT THIS ERA.

133
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,499
OR PERHAPS THIS
IS ALL THEY REQUIRE

134
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,001
TO COMPLETE THE PATTERN
OF OUR DEATH.

135
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,003
AND THESE, CAPTAIN?

136
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,006
BEAUTIFUL SPECIMEN.

137
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,424

138
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,633
BUT DANGEROUS.

139
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,718
WHATEVER
THE MELKOTIANS
HAVE PLANNED FOR US,

140
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,179
IT WON'T
BE PLEASANT.

141
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,222
THESE COULD
BE USEFUL.

142
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,433
JUST REMEMBER
ONE THING.

143
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,644
TO INDIVIDUALS
AT CLOSE RANGE,

144
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,856
THESE COULD BE
AS DEADLY
AS PHASERS.

145
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,566
IN THE MIDST
OF WHAT SEEMS SO UNREAL--

146
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,194
THE HARSH REALITY.

147
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,820
THIS IS NOT A DREAM.

148
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,864
[BANGING]

149
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,998

TOMBSTONE.

153
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,839
HELL FOR LEATHER,

154
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,799
RIGHT OUT
OF HISTORY.

155
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,471
BUT WHY HERE?

156
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,431
AND WHY NOW?

157
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,267
CAPTAIN,
THE MELKOT SAID
YOU WERE THE PATTERN.

158
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,478
HE LOOKED
INTO YOUR MIND

159
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,522
AND SELECTED
WHAT HE CONSIDERED

160
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,815
THE PROPER TIME
AND PLACE
FOR OUR PUNISHMENT.

161
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,027
BECAUSE MY ANCESTORS PIONEERED
THE AMERICAN FRONTIER.

162
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:29,986
YES.

163
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,613
THE VIOLENCE
OF YOUR OWN HERITAGE

164
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,450
IS TO BE THE PATTERN
FOR OUR EXECUTION.

165
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,452
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH US? WE'RE TALKING
LIKE WE REALLY ARE

166
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,954
IN TOMBSTONE,
ARIZONA, IN 1881.

167
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,291
PRECISELY, IN TERMS
OF WHAT THE MELKOTS
INTEND FOR US.

168
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,876
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT DATE--

169
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,880
OCTOBER 26, 1881--

170
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,757
BUT WHAT WAS IT?

171
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,133
IKE!

172
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,847
IKE!

173
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,974
FRANK! BILLY! TOM!

174
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,561
IKE, I WAS AFRAID
YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO MAKE IT.

175
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,978
LOOKS LIKE
WE DID.

176
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,189
I KNEW YOU
WOULDN'T LET THEM
SCARE YOU AWAY.

177
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,775
THEY'RE A BUNCH
OF HOT AIR,
IF YOU ASK ME.

351
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,133
YES, OF COURSE YOU DID,
AND I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

352
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,303
WE'RE DONE
TALKING, CLANTON.

353
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,098
THERE'S BEEN SOME
SORT OF MISTAKE,
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

354
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,349
ALL RIGHT, CLANTON.
ONE MORE CHANCE--YOUR LAST.

355
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,061
YOU'VE GOT
UNTIL 5:00 TONIGHT

356
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,522
TO GET YOUR HORSE-STEALING
SCURVY CREW OUT OF TOWN.

357
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,776
ALL THE WAY.

358
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,613
YES, WE'D BE GLAD TO.
WE DON'T WANT TO FIGHT.

359
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:20,159
I ALWAYS SAID
YOU WAS YELLOW,
CLANTON.

360
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,248
I'LL MAKE ONE MORE
ATTEMPT TO GET THROUGH
TO YOU, MR. EARP.

361
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,668
MY NAME IS NOT CLANTON,
IT'S KIRK.

362
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,296
OH, YEAH. WE HEARD
THE TALK ABOUT
YOUR JOKES.

363
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,339
I'M NOT JOKING.

364
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:37,718
SURE. WELL, I'M GLAD
TO MEET YOU...

365
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,553
MR. KIRK.

366
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,980
DRAW, CLANTON.

367
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,731
NOT ME, MR. EARP.

368
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,692
YOU DRAW, OR I WILL.

369
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,111
NO, WYATT.

370
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,321
LET ME.

371
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,866
WHEN THE TIME COMES,

372
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,494
I'LL PAY HIM
FOR THIS.

373
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,208
WE DON'T WANT
ANY TROUBLE.

374
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,502
WE'D BE GLAD
TO COOPERATE.

375
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,254
5:00, CLANTON.
IS THAT CLEAR?

376
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,176
IF YOU'RE IN TOWN
AT 5:01,

377
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,178
WE'LL KILL
EVERY ONE OF YOU

378
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,723
WHETHER YOU DRAW OR NOT.

379
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,558
IS THAT CLEAR?

380
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,654
OUCH!

381
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,446
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

382
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,158
WHAT DO YOU CALL
THAT STUFF--FIRE?

383
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,160
TAOS LIGHTNING.
STRAIGHT BOURBON.

384
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,578
TRY SOME.
IN SMALL AMOUNTS,

385
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,830
IT WAS CONSIDERED
MEDICINAL.

386
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,166
THEY OUGHT TO LABEL IT
"FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY."

387
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,877
IT JUST TAKES A BIT OF
GETTING USED TO, CAPTAIN.

388
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,089
ACTUALLY, A MAN
COULD GROW QUITE FOND
OF THIS STUFF.

389
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,256
TAKE IT EASY,
MR. SCOTT.

390
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,216
I HATE TO THINK WHAT
THAT STUFF'S DOING

391
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,717
TO YOUR
STOMACH LINING.

392
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:00,676
AND YOUR REFLEXES.

393
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,096
AND WE'RE GONNA NEED
FAST REFLEXES FROM NOW ON.

394
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,389
THERE'S NO NEGOTIATING
WITH THE EARPS.
WE KNOW THAT.

395
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,017
AYE. IF WE ONLY
HAD A PHASER.

396
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,894
OR A COMMUNICATOR.

397
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,353
IT'D BE A PLEASURE
TO WATCH THOSE EARPS

398
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,397
AS WE BEAMED
BACK TO THE SHIP

399
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,274
AT EXACTLY 4:59:30.

400
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,984
COULD WE MAKE
A COMMUNICATOR?

401
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,611
IMPOSSIBLE, CAPTAIN.
IN THIS CENTURY,

402
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,614
THERE ARE NO METAL ALLOYS
OR POWER SOURCES

403
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,407
TO MAKE DEVICES
SUCH AS OURS.

404
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,867
THE PROBLEM IS CLEAR, SPOCK.

405
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,953
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEEK
CONTEMPORARY SOLUTIONS.

406
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,079
WHERE'S CHEKOV?

407
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,415
MR. CHEKOV IS INVOLVED,
CAPTAIN.

408
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,252
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME
BACK TO TOWN, BILLY.

409
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,296
MORGAN WILL KILL YOU
BECAUSE HE WANTS ME.

410
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,380
WITH HIS OUTDATED WEAPON?

411
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,092
IF HE SHOOTS AT ME,
I WILL JUST...

412
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,136
STEP OUT OF THE WAY.

413
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,471
YOU CAN JOKE ABOUT IT.

414
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,514
I'VE SEEN 'EM IN ACTION.

415
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,808
ESPECIALLY MORGAN.

416
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,061
A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THINGS
HAVE TRIED TO KILL ME.

417
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,854
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

418
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,773
MR. CHEKOV--
I MEAN BILLY...

419
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,357
COME ALONG.

420
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,152
YES, SIR.

421
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,029
BILLY?

422
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,658
PLEASE, DON'T EVEN
GO NEAR HIM.

423
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,451
GENTLEMEN.

424
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,001
WHERE ARE WE GOING,
CAPTAIN?

425
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:18,087
TO EXERCISE
THE BETTER PART OF VALOR.

426
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,942
WELL, THAT SETTLES THAT.

427
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,028
A FORCE FIELD.

428
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,238
[CLOCK CHIMING]

429
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,327
IT IS OBVIOUS
THE MELKOTIANS

430
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,620
ARE NOT GOING
TO PERMIT US
TO LEAVE THIS TOWN.

431
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,581
IF WE COULD ONLY
CONTACT THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

432
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,042
YES, BUT WHERE IS
THE<i> ENTERPRISE?</i>

433
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,835
MR. CHEKOV, IF YOU WERE
IN CHARGE OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

434
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,919
WHAT WOULD YOU
BE DOING?

435
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,088
I'D BE USING
THE SHIP'S SENSORS

436
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,464
TRYING TO LOCATE US.

437
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,467
VERY GOOD. IF WE
COULD FIND THE PLACE
WHERE WE BEAMED DOWN,

438
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,720
THE SHIP MIGHT
LOCK IN AND BEAM US UP.

439
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:08,679
WELL, LET'S GET THERE.

440
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,598
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
KNOW WHERE IT IS, DOCTOR.

441
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,101
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE
WITHIN A 1,000-MILE RADIUS.

442
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,478
MR. SPOCK, WHY DON'T YOU
JOIN US COMMON HUMANOIDS

443
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,064
IN TRYING TO FIND
A WAY OUT OF HERE

444
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,982
AND QUIT EXPLAINING
WHY WE CAN'T GET OUT
OF HERE.

445
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,026
WE HAVE UNTIL 5:00
TO FIND THAT WAY.

446
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,569
NOW CONSIDER THIS--

447
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:27,073
WHAT MATERIALS
WERE ON HAND IN 1881

448
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:30,576
THAT COULD HELP US
FIGHT THE EARPS
ON THEIR OWN TERMS?

449
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:31,994
WE HAVE THESE,
CAPTAIN.

450
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,538
NO, THE MELKOTS GAVE US
THOSE TO EXECUTE US.

451
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,873
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY

452
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,499
TO PUT THE EARPS
OUT OF ACTION.

453
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,960
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT EXISTS HERE AND NOW

454
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,545
THAT COULD HELP US
OUT OF THIS TRAP?

455
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,633
ALL THOSE
WESTERN COSSACKS HAD

456
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,969
WERE POISONOUS SNAKES
AND CACTUS PLANTS.

457
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,015
BONES...THE VENOM.
THE PLANTS.

458
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,974
CAN YOU MAKE
USE OF THEM?

459
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,517
A TRANQUILIZER!

460
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,020
OF COURSE, JIM. I CAN
MAKE A TRANQUILIZER!

461
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,273
I COULD MAKE A DEVICE
TO DELIVER IT ON TARGET.

462
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,775
FIRST, BONES,
THE INGREDIENTS
YOU REQUIRE?

463
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,485
I KNOW THE PLACE TO GET
THE PROPER DRUGS.

464
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,696
I'LL NEED A MORTAR
AND A PESTLE.

465
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,156
CHEKOV,
MORTAR AND PESTLE.

466
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,574
HOW DO YOU
INTEND TO DELIVER

467
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,992
THE TRANQUILIZER
ON TARGET?

468
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,328
I SHALL NEED SOME FUSING
AND SOME COTTON WADDING.

469
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,788
COTTON WADDING--
TRY THE APOTHECARY.

470
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:16,454
AYE.

471
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,457
I SHALL MANUFACTURE
THE EQUIVALENT

472
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,585
OF AN ANCIENT
GENERATING CANISTER,

473
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,798
MORE FAMILIARLY KNOWN
AS A GAS GRENADE.

474
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,058
I'LL BE ABOUT
FIVE MINUTES YET.

475
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,227
YOU COULD COME BACK.

476
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,603
WELL, THANK YOU.

477
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,773
MIND IF I LOOK
AROUND A BIT?

478
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,573
CRUDE,
BUT VERY USABLE.

479
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,660
I WOULDN'T
TOUCH THAT STUFF
IF I WAS YOU.

480
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:55,953
OH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY.

481
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,372
I KNOW HOW
TO HANDLE THIS.

482
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,251
I HAVE
AN URGENT NEED

483
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,670
FOR A SMALL SUPPLY
OF THIS DRUG, TOO.

484
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,131
THAT STUFF AIN'T MINE.
IT BELONGS TO HIM.

485
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,506
YOU'D BETTER ASK HIM.

486
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,760
OH, SO YOU'RE
THE DENTIST.

487
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,430
WELL, I'M A PHYSICIAN,
AND I HAVE A SERIOUS
EMERGENCY.

488
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,391
I WONDER IF YOU'D MIND
IF I BORROW

489
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,643
A SMALL QUANTITY
OF THIS.

490
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,110
YOU WANT IT NOW?

491
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,403
MY NAME IS McCOY.

492
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,696
I'M A DOCTOR.

493
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:35,909
THAT JOKE IS ALL
AROUND TOWN ALREADY...
McLOWERY.

494
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,912
WELL, MY NAME
IS STILL HOLLIDAY.

495
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,457
DOC HOLLIDAY.

496
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,088
THE EMERGENCY IS REAL.

497
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,424
I NEED THESE THINGS.

498
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,888
YOUR EMERGENCY
SURE IS REAL.

499
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,559
GO ON, TAKE THE STUFF.

500
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,104
HAVE SOME MORE FUN.

501
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,735
HA HA. TAKE MY BAG.

502
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,031
ONLY, BEST YOU BE
FINISHED BEFORE 5:00.

503
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,536
THAT IS MY INTENTION,
DOCTOR.

504
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,080
BECAUSE AT ONE MINUTE
PAST 5:00,

505
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,542
YOU'LL FIND A HOLE
IN YOUR HEAD...

506
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,586
RIGHT FROM THIS GUN.

507
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,997
AHEM.

508
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,499
SYLVIA!

509
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,587
HELLO.

510
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,339
BILLY CLAIBORNE,

511
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:16,051
DO YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY
I AM ABOUT YOU?

512
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,262
THAT'S...VERY NICE.

513
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,639
WELL, AREN'T YOU
GOING TO ASK ME

514
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,683
WHAT I'VE GOT
IN MY SHOPPING BAG?

515
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:27,480
THAT'S...JUST WHAT I WAS
PREPARING TO INQUIRE.

516
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,108
HAVE YOU BEEN SHOPPING?

517
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,734
OF COURSE, SILLY!

518
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,029
WHAT ELSE
WOULD I BE DOING
ON A BEAUTIFUL AFTERNOON

519
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,656
WITH THE DANCE
ONLY ONE WEEK AWAY?

520
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,951
OR HAVE YOU
FORGOTTEN THAT ALREADY?

521
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,036
NO...NO,
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN.

522
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,663
I AM LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT...

523
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,543
MOST EAGERLY.

524
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,296
YOU WILL BE
ABSOLUTELY WILD

525
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,799
WHEN YOU SEE ME
IN THE NEW GOWN
I'M GOING TO MAKE.

526
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,093
I FOUND THIS MOST
SCRUMPTIOUS MATERIAL,

527
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,638
YARDS AND YARDS OF IT.

528
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,935
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING, BILLY?

529
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,021
I WAS THINKING

530
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:12,024
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
WEDDING GOWN
IT WOULD MAKE.

531
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,988
WHY DON'T WE
JUST TURN THAT DANCE
INTO A WEDDING BALL?

532
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,283
IT WOULD BE SO HEAVENLY.

533
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,495
MARRIED?

534
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,874
I'M...AFRAID...

535
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,668
THAT WOULDN'T
BE POSSIBLE.

536
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,507
BUT I'M POSITIVE
THE GOWN WILL BE READY.

537
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,676
AND WHAT ELSE IS THERE
TO STOP A WEDDING?

538
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,345
BUT IT IS
ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE.

539
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,931
I AM NOT SOMEONE
YOU CAN MARRY.

540
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:49,520
IF...ONLY I COULD
MAKE...CLEAR TO YOU...

541
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,271
WHAT I REALLY AM.

542
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:54,525
DO YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW?

543
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,485
BILLY CLAIBORNE...

544
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,779
YOU ARE A CATTLE RUSTLER
AND A HORSE THIEF...

545
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,616
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT ELSE.

546
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:10,040
I WARNED YOU, CLAIBORNE.
STAY AWAY.

547
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,667
AAH!

548
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,384
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TAKE ANYTHING
FROM THAT SCUM,

549
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,552
NOT WHILE I'M HERE.

550
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,014
MR. EARP.

551
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,226
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF HER.

552
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,538
AAH!

553
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,544
BILLY!

554
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,693
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO, JIM.

555
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,630
COME ON, CLANTON.
LET'S DO IT NOW.

556
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,763
CAPTAIN, LET ME.
NO!

557
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:48,847
YEAH, COME ON,
CAPTAIN.

558
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,474
LET HIM.

559
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,309
CAPTAIN, WE CAN'T
JUST STAND HERE AND TAKE IT!

560
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,602
YES, WE CAN.

561
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,103
BUT THEY MURDERED CHEKOV!
IF YOU THINK I'M GOING TO--

562
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,855
SCOTTY...

563
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,358
THEY'RE TRYING TO PUSH US
INTO SOMETHING
WE'RE NOT READY FOR.

564
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,610
AND IT IS NOT
YET OUR TIME.

565
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,832
LET IT GO, JIM.
HE'S DEAD.

566
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:19,002
MAYBE HE WOULDN'T BE
IF I HADN'T IGNORED
THE MELKOT WARNING.

567
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,882
WE ALL KNEW THE RISK
WHEN WE JOINED THE SERVICE.

568
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,844
NOW LET IT GO.

569
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,679
GENTLEMEN,
THERE IS ONE THING

570
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,890
WHICH REQUIRES
THE IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
OF ALL OF US--

571
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,351
SPECIFICALLY, OUR FUTURE.

572
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:39,189
BUT NOT THIS MINUTE,
SPOCK.

573
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:43,318
IT TAKES US...
A LITTLE LONGER.

574
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,906
I UNDERSTAND
THE FEELING, CAPTAIN.

575
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,659
YOU TALK ABOUT
ANOTHER MAN'S FEELINGS.

576
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,619
WHAT DO YOU FEEL, SPOCK?

577
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:55,581
MY FEELINGS ARE NOT SUBJECT
FOR DISCUSSION, DOCTOR.

578
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,250
BECAUSE THERE ARE
NO FEELINGS TO DISCUSS!

579
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,670
MR. SPOCK,
CHEKOV IS DEAD!

580
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,506
I SAY IT NOW
AND I CAN HARDLY
BELIEVE IT,

581
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,466
BUT YOU WORKED
CLOSELY WITH HIM.

582
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,385
THAT DESERVES
SOME MEMORIAL.

583
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,430
SPOCK WILL HAVE NO TRUCK
WITH GRIEF, SCOTTY.

584
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,139
IT'S HUMAN.

585
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,392
BONES...SCOTTY--

586
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,935
CAPTAIN...

587
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,354
IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

588
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,690
THEY FORGET I AM
HALF HUMAN.

589
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,197
[CLOCK CHIMES THE HOUR]

590
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,790
WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME.

591
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:41,334
CAPTAIN...I VAGUELY REMEMBER
THE HISTORICAL ACCOUNT

592
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,129
OF THE FAMOUS BATTLE
IN WHICH WE ARE ABOUT
TO ENGAGE,

593
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,505
BUT I AM CONFUSED.

594
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,715
ABOUT WHAT?

595
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,134
SINCE EACH OF US
REPRESENTS MEMBERS

596
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,510
OF THE CLANTON GANG--

597
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:54,055
YOU, IKE CLANTON,
I, FRANK McLOWERY--

598
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,518
THEN MR. CHEKOV WOULD
BE THE OTHER BILLY,
WOULD HE NOT?

599
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,228
WILLIAM CLAIBORNE,
THAT'S RIGHT.

600
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,022
BUT DID NOT
WILLIAM CLAIBORNE

601
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,567
SURVIVE THE BATTLE
AT THE O.K. CORRAL?

602
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,741
GET TO THE POINT, SPOCK.

603
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,326
MR. CHEKOV IS DEAD.

604
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:18,413
BUT IN THE ACTUAL GUNFIGHT,
WILLIAM CLAIBORNE SURVIVED.

605
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,791
YES.

606
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,584
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

607
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,377
THAT MEANS IT
DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN

608
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,171
THE WAY IT HAPPENED.

609
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,923
WE CAN CHANGE IT.

610
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,344
BONES, HOW'S
THE TRANQUILIZER COMING?

611
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,262
I'LL HAVE IT READY
BEFORE SPOCK.

612
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,973
ANOTHER HOUR.
SPOCK?

613
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,891
AND WE'LL HAVE
A TRANQUILIZER GRENADE?

614
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:38,809
NOT PRECISELY.

615
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,477
FORGET PRECISION.
WILL IT WORK?

616
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,354
IT SHOULD.

617
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,396
MAKE SURE IT DOES, SPOCK.

618
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,982
IF WE DON'T
TRANQUILIZE THEM,

619
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,149
WE'LL HAVE TO FIGHT THEM.

620
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,901
AND IF WE FIGHT THEM,
WE ALL DIE.

621
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:48,944
WE KNOW THAT.

622
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,613
NEGOTIATING WITH THEM
COULD BUY US MORE TIME,
CAPTAIN.

623
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,616
BUT NOT WITH THE EARPS.
I'VE TRIED THAT. THAT'S OUT.

624
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,911
THERE MUST BE A WAY.

625
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,247
HISTORY HAS BEEN CHANGED

626
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,209
IN THE FACT THAT
BILLY CLAIBORNE DIDN'T DIE,

627
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,586
BUT CHEKOV
IS LYING THERE DEAD.

628
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:10,048
THAT MEANS THERE MUST BE
A WAY TO CHANGE THIS TIME
IN HISTORY.

629
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,591
IT WOULD BE WORTH A TRY,

630
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,636
AT LEAST UNTIL WE'RE CERTAIN
OF THE DEVICE.

631
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,055
THEN PERHAPS WE COULD
QUIET THINGS DOWN.

632
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,265
BUT NOT WITH THE EARPS.

633
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,394
THERE IS...

634
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,646
ONE OTHER PLACE I CAN TRY.

635
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,280
YOU LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY?

636
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,870
YES, SHERIFF.

637
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,331
I WANT YOU
TO STOP THE FIGHT.

638
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,208
STOP IT?
WHO WANTS TO STOP IT?

639
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,627
I SURE DON'T. YOU DON'T.

640
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:48,837
YOU DIDN'T YESTERDAY.

641
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,923
I DO NOW.

642
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:53,383
SINCE WHEN DOES
A CLANTON RUN CRAWLING
TO THE LAW FOR HELP?

643
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,468
HOW ELSE IS HE
GONNA GET JUSTICE?

644
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,804
FROM THIS! YOU AND YOUR BOYS
SET UP THIS WHOLE THING

645
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,056
TO TAKE CARE OF THE EARPS.

646
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,975
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
TO DECIDE YOU DON'T HAVE
THE BELLY FOR IT.

647
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,476
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

648
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,563
SHERIFF! SHERIFF...

649
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,275
THERE MUST BE PLENTY
OF DECENT PEOPLE
IN THIS TOWN

650
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,360
WHO DON'T LIKE
THE EARPS.
LET'S ORGANIZE THEM.

651
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,237
DON'T TALK NONSENSE.

652
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,239
PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
ARE COUNTING ON YOU

653
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,033
TO GET RID OF
THE EARPS FOR THEM.

654
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,242
THEN THE PEOPLE
BETTER WAKE UP

655
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,535
AND LET THE LAW
WORK FOR THEM.

656
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,079
YOU CAN TALK THAT WAY

657
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,581
AFTER WHAT THE EARPS
DID TO BILLY TODAY?

658
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,879
NOBODY HERE WILL DENY YOU
YOUR RIGHT TO YOUR REVENGE.

659
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,550
YES, I WANT REVENGE.

660
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:39,262
I WANT TO...
CRUSH THE LIFE
OUT OF THE EARPS.

661
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,807
BUT I CAN'T JUST
KILL THEM.

662
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,225
LISTEN TO ME.

663
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,519
GET DOWN TO THE O.K. CORRAL,
KEEP OUT OF SIGHT.

664
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,980
WHEN THE EARPS
COME LOOKING...

665
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:49,522
YOU BUSHWHACK 'EM!

666
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,858
CAN'T I GET IT THROUGH
YOUR STUPID HEAD
I CAN'T JUST KILL THEM?!

667
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,485
I CAN'T JUST KILL 'EM!
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

668
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,236
I CAN'T MURDER THEM!
I CAN'T KILL THEM!

669
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,865
KILL 'EM ANY WAY
YOU CAN!

670
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,121
THERE'LL BE NO QUESTIONS
ASKED. HONEST.

671
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,873
I GUARANTEE THAT!

672
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,095
THESE CRUDE SUPPLIES
WE WERE FORCED TO USE

673
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,388
WORKED QUITE WELL.

674
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,682
I DOUBT THAT THIS
COMBINATION OF THINGS

675
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,476
WAS EVER USED
FOR ANY PURPOSE
QUITE LIKE THIS.

676
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,939
PERHAPS THEY WOULD'VE BEEN
IF THEY'D HAD YOUR
INGENUITY, DOCTOR.

677
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,904
CAPTAIN.

678
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,075
HOW SOON WILL
THAT BE READY?

679
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,326
RIGHT NOW.

680
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,662
GOOD. HOW LONG
WILL IT TAKE

681
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,080
THE TRANQUILIZER
TO HAVE EFFECT?

682
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,166
3 OR 4 SECONDS.

683
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,543
HOW DID YOU MANAGE
TO TEST IT?

684
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,336
IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED.

685
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,172
IT'S NOT NECESSARY,
CAPTAIN.

686
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,298
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
NOTHING CAN GO WRONG.

687
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,342
UP TO NOW,
EVERYTHING HAS GONE WRONG.

688
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,468
I WANT IT TESTED NOW.

689
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:04,222
WOULD A VOLUNTEER
SOLVE THE PROBLEM?

690
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,265
IT WOULD.

691
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,560
ALL RIGHT.
ON ONE CONDITION.

692
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:12,397
THAT I'M WIDE AWAKE
AND WITH YOU
AT 5:00.

693

695
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,075
IT'S TO KILL THE PAIN.

696
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,951
BUT THIS IS PAINLESS.

697
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:28,080
WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE WARNED
ME SOONER, MR. SPOCK.

698
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:29,915

699
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,035
IT SHOULD HAVE WORKED.

700
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,287
DID YOU INHALE
THE GAS, SCOTTY?

701
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,163
AYE. DEEPLY.

702
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,249
YOU STILL FEEL
ALL RIGHT?

703
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,833
I NEVER FELT
BETTER.

705
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:17,837
IT DOESN'T WORK.

707
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,717

TO UNDERSTAND.

709
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,810
IT DID NOT FUNCTION,
BUT IT MUST FUNCTION.

710
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,146
NOTHING COULD GO WRONG,
CAPTAIN. IT SHOULD WORK.

711
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,231
A SCIENTIFIC FACT...

712
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,191
BUT IF THE TRANQUILIZER
DOES NOT FUNCTION,

713
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,152
WHICH IS CLEARLY IMPOSSIBLE,

714
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:44,072
THEN A RADICAL ALTERATION

MUST BE IN ORDER.

ABOUT THAT NOW, JIM.

END AT THE O.K. CORRAL.

WAIT RIGHT HERE

00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,054
WE BETTER
STAND AND FIGHT.

731
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,972
GOOD. IF THEY
WANT A FIGHT,

00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,473
LET'S GIVE THEM
A FIGHT.

733
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,850
THEY'RE EXPERTS
AT GUNFIGHTING.

THEN WE'D BETTER
BECOME EXPERTS, AND FAST.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

742
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,117
I MEAN, DOCTOR,
THAT WE ARE FACED

CONTRADICTION.

744

BEEN EFFECTIVE

749
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,758
WHAT KILLED MR. CHEKOV?

752
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,347

COME ON, SPOCK, IF YOU'VE
GOT THE ANSWER, TELL US.

754
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,393
PHYSICAL REALITY

DO NOT OPERATE,

757
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,481
THERE IS NO REALITY.

ALL OF THIS...

759
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,651
IS UNREAL.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN
UNREAL?

761
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,988
I EXAMINED CHEKOV.
HE'S DEAD.

762
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,615
BUT YOU MADE
YOUR EXAMINATION

763
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,951
UNDER CONDITIONS
WHICH WE CANNOT TRUST.

764
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,704
WE JUDGE REALITY
BY THE RESPONSE
OF OUR SENSES.

765
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,124
ONCE WE ARE CONVINCED
OF THE REALITY

766
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,125

767
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,168

THEREFORE THEY CAN KILL.

771
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,469
CHEKOV IS DEAD
BECAUSE HE BELIEVED

772
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,930
THE BULLETS
WOULD KILL HIM.

773
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,890
HE MAY INDEED BE DEAD.

774
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:16,933
WE DO NOT KNOW.

775
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,811
BUT WE DO KNOW

776
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,272
THAT THE MELKOTIANS
CREATED THE SITUATION.

777
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,523

ALLOW OURSELVES

778
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,192
TO BELIEVE THAT
THE BULLETS ARE REAL,

779
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,027

ARE UNREAL,

00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,783
THEREFORE
THEY CANNOT HARM ME.

783

YOU ARE, MR. SPOCK,

00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,660
CAPTAIN.

875
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,787
MAY I
ASK A QUESTION?

876
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,456
YOU NEEDN'T ANSWER
IF IT SEEMS
TOO PERSONAL.

877
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:42,002
I'M SURE I'LL BE ABLE
TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER,
MR. SPOCK.

878
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,296
THIS AFTERNOON,

879
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:47,258
YOU WANTED TO KILL,

880
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,594
DIDN'T YOU?

881
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:52,597
BUT HE DIDN'T KILL,
MR. SPOCK.

882
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:53,681
BUT HE WANTED TO,
DOCTOR.

883
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,225
IS THAT THE WAY
IT SEEMED TO YOU, MR. SPOCK?

884
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:56,933
YES, CAPTAIN.

885
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,772
MR. SPOCK...

886
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:02,314
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

887
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,859
THAT'S EXACTLY
THE WAY IT WAS.

888
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,278
MANKIND...

889
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,655
READY TO KILL.

890
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:11,908
THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS
IN 1881.

891
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,534
I WONDER

892
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,160
HOW HUMANITY

893
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,204
MANAGED TO SURVIVE.

894
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:22,334
WE OVERCAME OUR INSTINCT
FOR VIOLENCE.
