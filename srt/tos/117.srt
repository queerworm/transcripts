FOR NORMAL APPROACH, SIR.

862
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:09,804
NORMAL ORBIT
APPROACH PROCEDURES, MR. SULU.

863
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:10,722
CAPTAIN?

864
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,557
MR. SPOCK,
STILL THINKING ABOUT TRELANE,

865
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:13,599
IS THAT IT?

866
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,519
FOR THE RECORD, CAPTAIN,
HOW DO WE DESCRIBE HIM?

867
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:19,104
PURE MENTALITY?
FORCE OF INTELLECT?

868
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,399
EMBODIED ENERGY?
SUPER BEING?

869
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,109
HE MUST BE CLASSIFIED, SIR.

870
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,654
GOD OF WAR, MR. SPOCK.

871
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:29,240
WELL, I HARDLY
FIND THAT FITTING.

872
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,369
THEN A SMALL BOY,
AND A VERY NAUGHTY ONE AT THAT.

873
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,205
IT WILL MAKE A STRANGE ENTRY
IN THE LIBRARY BANKS.

874
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:37,874
WELL, THEN HE WAS
A VERY STRANGE, SMALL BOY.

875
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:39,458
ON THE OTHER HAND,
HE WAS PROBABLY DOING THINGS

876
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,461
COMPARABLE TO THE SAME
MISCHIEVOUS PRANKS YOU PLAYED

877
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,962
WHEN YOU WERE A BOY.

878
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,964
MISCHIEVOUS PRANKS, CAPTAIN?

879
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:50,052
YES, DIPPING LITTLE GIRLS' CURLS
IN INKWELLS,

880
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,679
STEALING APPLES
FROM THE NEIGHBOR'S TREES,

881
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,768
TYING CANS ON--

882
00:48:56,768 --> 00:49:00,730
FORGIVE ME, MR. SPOCK.

883
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,189
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

884
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:06,943
I SHALL BE DELIGHTED, CAPTAIN.

885
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:37,099
