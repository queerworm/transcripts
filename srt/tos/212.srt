1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,472
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

2
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,016
PERHAPS THEY WEREN'T
EXPECTING US.

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,978
OUR ARRIVAL WAS SCHEDULED
WELL IN ADVANCE, DOCTOR.

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,815
THE ANNUAL CHECK
OF EVERY SCIENTIFIC
EXPEDITION IS ROUTINE.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,818
I HAD A SUBSPACE CONTACT
WITH A ROBERT JOHNSON,

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,195
THE LEADER OF THIS
EXPEDITION, AN HOUR AGO.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,446
DID HE REPORT
ANYTHING WRONG?

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,032
NO, YET THERE WAS
SOMETHING WRONG.

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,742
I CAN'T QUITE
PIN IT DOWN.

10
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,911
HIS CONVERSATION
WAS DISJOINTED,

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,706
HIS THOUGHTS
A LITTLE FOGGY, UNRELATED.

12
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,290
CHEKOV, CHECK THAT BUILDING.

13
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,251
MR. SPOCK AND I
WILL CHECK THIS ONE.

14
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,005
THE REST OF YOU,
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANYONE.

15
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,485
CAPTAIN!

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,071
CAPTAIN!

17
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,907
CAPTAIN! CAPTAIN!

18
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,742
WHAT IS IT?

19
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,785
A MAN, SIR.
IN THERE.

20
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,620
A DEAD MAN.

21
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,810
WELL?

22
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,271
EXACTLY
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE--

23
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,231
DEATH
BY NATURAL CAUSES.

24
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,441
OLD AGE.

25
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,026
QUITE IMPOSSIBLE, DOCTOR.

26
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,445
I RAN A PERSONNEL CHECK
ON THIS ENTIRE EXPEDITION

27
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,446
BEFORE WE BEAMED DOWN.

28
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,407
I ASSURE YOU
THAT NONE OF THEM--

29
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,086
THEY'VE COME TO
PAY THEIR RESPECTS
TO ALVIN.

30
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,963
I'M CAPTAIN KIRK OF--

31
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,715
YOU'LL HAVE
TO SPEAK LOUDER.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,594
I SAY I'M CAPTAIN KIRK
OF THE U.S.S.<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

33
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,346
WHO ARE YOU?

34
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,933
I'M ROBERT JOHNSON.

35
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,561
THIS IS MY WIFE,
ELAINE.

36
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,650
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

37
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,943
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

38
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,945
I'M, UH...

39
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,863
LET ME SEE.

40
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,074
I AM 29,

41
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,576
AND ELAINE IS...

42
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,870
I'M 27.

43
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,592
Captain Kirk:<i> SPACE--</i>
<i>THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

44
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,811
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE.

45
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,729
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

46
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,149
<i>TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>STRANGE NEW WORLDS...</i>

47
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,652
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...</i>

48
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,906
<i>TO BOLDLY GO WHERE</i>
<i>NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.</i>

49
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:01,491
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG.</i>
<i>STARDATE 3478.2.</i>

50
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,534
<i>ON A ROUTINE MISSION</i>

51
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,494
<i>TO RESUPPLY</i>
<i>THE EXPERIMENTAL COLONY</i>

52
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,038
<i>AT GAMMA HYDRA 4,</i>

53
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,415
<i>WE DISCOVERED A MOST</i>
<i>UNUSUAL PHENOMENON.</i>

54
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,500
<i>OF THE SIX MEMBERS</i>
<i>OF THE COLONY,</i>

55
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,044
<i>NONE OF WHOM WERE OVER 30,</i>

56
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,963
<i>WE FOUND FOUR HAD DIED</i>
<i>AND TWO WERE DYING...</i>

57
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,882
<i>OF OLD AGE.</i>

58
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,341
MR. JOHNSON,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

59
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,052
I CAN HEAR YOU.

60
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,221
NOT DEAF YET,
YOU KNOW.

61
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,597
NOT YET.

62
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,307
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

63
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,560
WHAT HAPPENED?

64
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,687
DID YOUR INSTRUMENTS
SHOW ANYTHING?

65
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,982
ELAINE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

66
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,610
SO BEAUTIFUL.

67
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,530
SO BEAUTIFUL.

68
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,121
HE CAN HEAR YOU, JIM,

69
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,456
BUT HE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND.

70
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,042
LET'S LET HIM REST.

71
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,378
IF THEY SEEM LUCID,
I'LL BE IN THE BRIEFING ROOM.

72
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,882
STAY SEATED.
LET'S GET STARTED.

73
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,760
I'VE ASKED YOU TO BE
PART OF THIS BRIEFING

74
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,344
BECAUSE GAMMA HYDRA 4

75
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,846
FALLS IN YOUR
ADMINISTRATIVE AREA.

76
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,640
I APPRECIATE THAT, SIR.

77
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,810
DR. WALLACE, AS AN EXPERT
IN ENDOCRINOLOGY,

78
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,188
I'D APPRECIATE YOU WORKING
VERY CLOSELY WITH DR. McCOY.

79
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,355
YES, CAPTAIN.

80
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,776
AND DR. McCOY,
WOULD YOU FILL THEM IN?

81
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,737
THE EXPEDITION IS SUFFERING
FROM EXTREME OLD AGE.

82
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,782
THEY'RE GROWING OLDER
BY THE MINUTE.
MUCH OLDER.

83
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,035
MY EXAMINATIONS
HAVE TURNED UP
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

84
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,830
IN FACT,
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

85
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,874
WHAT ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE
AND ENVIRONMENT, MR. SPOCK?

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,211
SENSORS REVEAL NOTHING
WHICH IS INIMICAL
TO HUMAN LIFE.

87
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,629
THE ATMOSPHERE
SCREENS OUT

88
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,338
THE USUAL AMOUNT
OF HARMFUL COSMIC RAYS.

89
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,341
WE'RE CLOSE
TO THE NEUTRAL ZONE

90
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,886
BETWEEN OUR FEDERATION
AND THE ROMULAN EMPIRE.

91
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,639
IT'S POSSIBLE THE ROMULANS
HAVE A NEW WEAPON

92
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,891
AND ARE USING THIS COLONY
AS GUINEA PIGS.

93
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,102
I HAVE ALREADY BEGUN
INVESTIGATION

94
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,812
INTO THAT POSSIBILITY,
CAPTAIN.

95
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,856
GOOD. I WANT YOU ALL TO
CHECK OUT EVERYTHING
IN YOUR OWN DEPARTMENTS.

96
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,608
NO MATTER HOW REMOTE,
HOW FARFETCHED THE NOTION,

97
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,735
I WANT IT RUN DOWN.

98
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,779
WE'LL STAY IN ORBIT
UNTIL WE HAVE THE ANSWER.

99
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,447
I'M SURE YOU
UNDERSTAND

100
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,866
THAT I
AM ANXIOUS TO GET
TO STARBASE 10

101
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,366
TO ASSUME
MY NEW POST.

102
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,869
YES, COMMODORE. WE'LL DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN

103
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:09,995
TO MAKE SURE
YOU MAKE YOUR DUTY.

104
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,122
THANK YOU, SIR.

105
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:27,512
DOCTOR, IS THERE
SOMETHING I CAN DO
FOR YOU?

106
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,682
WELL, BE A LITTLE LESS
THE COOL, EFFICIENT CAPTAIN

107
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,768
AND A LITTLE MORE
THE OLD FRIEND.

108
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,897
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

109
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,523
SIX YEARS,
FOUR MONTHS,

110
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,817
AND AN ODD NUMBER
OF DAYS.

111
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,819
YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW?

112
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,447
WELL, IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME.

113
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,574
THINGS WOULDN'T CHANGE

114
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,035
IF IT STARTED
ALL OVER AGAIN, WOULD IT?

115
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,912
YOU HAVE YOUR JOB,

116
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:52,913
I HAVE MY SHIP,

117
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,456
AND NEITHER ONE OF US
WILL CHANGE.

118
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,084
YOU SAID IT.
I DIDN'T.

119
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,919
IN ALL THOSE YEARS,

120
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,504
I ONLY HEARD
FROM YOU ONCE--

121
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,507
A STARGRAM WHEN
MY HUSBAND DIED.

122
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,886
YOU KNOW,
YOU NEVER ASKED ME
WHY I GOT MARRIED

123
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,555
AFTER
WE CALLED IT OFF.

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,934
WELL, I SUPPOSED THAT
YOU MET SOMEONE YOU LOVED.

125
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,020
I MET A MAN I ADMIRED.
A GREAT MAN.

126
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,273
AND IN THE SAME FIELD.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
GIVE UP A THING.

127
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,941
NO.

128
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,068
JUST YOU.

129
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,160
Uhura:<i>  CAPTAIN KIRK,</i>

130
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,829
<i>MR. SPOCK WOULD LIKE</i>
<i>TO SEE YOU ON THE BRIDGE.</i>

131
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,040
I'M ON MY WAY.

132
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,917
STANDARD ORBIT,
CAPTAIN.

133
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,919
MAINTAIN.

134
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,630
I'VE RECHECKED
THE SENSORS, CAPTAIN.

135
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,092
GAMMA HYDRA 4 CHECKS OUT
AS A CLASS "M" PLANET

136
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,636
WITH A CONVENTIONAL
OXYGEN/NITROGEN ATMOSPHERE
AND NORMAL MASS.

137
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,472
I CAN FIND NOTHING AT ALL
OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

138
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,057
WHAT ABOUT THE COMET
THAT ASTROPHYSICS
REPORTED?

139
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,102
WE'RE RUNNING CHECKS ON IT.
I'VE REACHED NO
CONCLUSIONS AS YET.

140
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,938
THE COMET WAS A ROGUE
AND HAS NEVER BEEN
INVESTIGATED.

141
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,106
CAPTAIN KIRK?

142
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,232
YES, COMMODORE.

143
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,484
FACILITIES
AT STARBASE 10 ARE
MUCH MORE COMPLETE

144
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,111
THAN THOSE
ONBOARD SHIP.

145
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,405
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
YOUR INVESTIGATIONS
WOULD BE FACILITATED

146
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,282
IF WE PROCEEDED
THERE.

147
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,117
I ASSURE YOU ALL
COOPERATION.

148
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,162
THANK YOU.
I KNOW YOU'RE ANXIOUS
TO GET TO THE BASE,

149
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,746
BUT WE HAVE A FEW
FACILITIES OF
OUR OWN HERE.

150
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,457
I THINK
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
WILL DO QUITE NICELY.

151
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,375
I'LL BE IN ENGINEERING,
MR. SPOCK.

152
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,502
MAINTAIN STANDARD ORBIT,
MR. SULU.

153
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,921
YOU ALREADY GAVE
THAT COMMAND, SIR.

154
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,007
OH? WELL...

155
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,633
FOLLOW IT.

156
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,395
LIEUTENANT GALWAY.

157
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,898
DOCTOR,
MAY I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

158
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,525
OF COURSE.
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

159
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,487
I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO
SOUND FOOLISH,

160
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,698
BUT I SEEM TO BE
HAVING A LITTLE
TROUBLE HEARING.

161
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,201
IT'S PROBABLY
NOTHING IMPORTANT.

162
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,411
I NEVER HAD TROUBLE
BEFORE.

163
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,456
WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

164
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,958
PERHAPS A LITTLE
HYPERSONIC TREATMENT
MIGHT CLEAR IT UP.

165
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,752
THANK YOU.

166
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,511
PROGRESS REPORT,
MR. SPOCK.

167
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,096
ALL RESEARCH LINES
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.

168
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,933
ASTRONOMICAL SECTION
REPORTS THAT A COMET
RECENTLY PASSED BY.

169
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,394
CHECK INTO THAT.

170
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,522
I'M DOING THAT, CAPTAIN,
AS PER YOUR PREVIOUS
ORDER.

171
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,024
YOU EXPRESSED THAT
EARLIER.

172
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,903
OH, YES. LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU COME UP WITH.

YOU'RE PROBABLY
RIGHT, DOCTOR.

BETTER RUN A COMPLETE

00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,737
WHY?

195
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,116
JUST MUSCULAR STRAIN,

196
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,869
NO, JIM.

197
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,123

IT'S SPREADING.

FOR SOME FIGURES?

BASED ON WHAT
DR. McCOY GAVE ME,

I ESTIMATE THAT PHYSICALLY
WE EACH HAVE LESS THAN
A WEEK TO LIVE.

217
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:25,995
ALSO, SINCE OUR MENTAL
FACULTIES ARE AGING FASTER

KEEP ME POSTED AS TO CHEKOV.

269
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,279
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON YOUR WAY TO THE
BIOCHEMISTRY LAB, DOCTOR.

270

WE'RE BOTH GO IN
THE SAME DIRECTION.

271
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,784
SO WE DO.

272
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,493
LOOK, WE KNOW
THE PROBLEM.

273
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,037
WE KNOW THE PROGRESS
OF THE AFFLICTION.

274
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,331
THEREFORE, ONCE WE FIND
THE PROPER LINE OF RESEARCH,

275
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,417
IT'S ONLY LOGICAL
WE FIND THE SOLUTION.

276
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:03,504
HA HA HA! SOUND LIKE
MY FIRST OFFICER.

277
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,383
NO PROBLEM
IS INSOLUBLE,
NOT EVEN OURS.

278
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,304
THAT DIDN'T SPRING
FROM LOGIC.

279
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,014
OUR SITUATION
DOESN'T HAVE ITS
ROOTS IN LOGIC.

280
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,435

A LOGICAL ORGAN.

REALIZE THAT? TODAY?

TALK ABOUT HIM.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT US.

WILL YOU SIGN

DO YOU HAVE A REASON
FOR BEING ON THE BRIDGE,

323
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,445
I'D HOPED FOR A FEW WORDS
WITH YOU AT YOUR CONVENIENCE.

324
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,196

00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:58,054
SINCE YOU'RE SO CONCERNED,
I'LL SEND A MESSAGE
TO STARBASE 10.

333

SUCH A MESSAGE THIS MORNING.

338
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,900
I GAVE IT TO YOU,

SIGNED IT.

339
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:14,028
IF I HAD SIGNED IT,
I WOULDN'T ASK FOR IT,
NOW WOULD I?

340
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,036
YOUR SIGNATURE,
CAPTAIN.

341
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,023
CAPTAIN.
I BELIEVE--

342
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,031
CAPTAIN. CAPTAIN.

343
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,783
MR. SPOCK,
I WAS JUST THINKING.

344
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,037
YES, SIR.
UNDERSTANDABLE.

345
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,249
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO REPORT?

346
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,417
YES, SIR.

347
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,628
I BELIEVE WE HAVE
THE CAUSE OF THE AFFLICTION.

348
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,671
WHAT IS IT?

349
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,924
THE ORBIT OF GAMMA HYDRA 4
CARRIED THE PLANET

350
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,801
DIRECTLY THROUGH
THE COMET'S TRAIL.

351
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,013
ON CONVENTIONAL
RADIATION SETTINGS,
WE DISCOVERED NOTHING.

352
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,808
IN RESETTING OUR SENSORS
TO THE EXTREME LOWER
RANGE OF THE SCALE,

353
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,019
UNDETECTED RADIATION
APPEARED.

354
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,522
BELOW NORMAL
RADIATION LEVELS
BUT DEFINITELY PRESENT

355
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,775
AND UNDOUBTEDLY RESIDUE
FROM THE COMET.

356
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,944
GOOD, SPOCK.
WELL DONE.

357
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,032
LET'S GET THIS TO
DR. McCOY IMMEDIATELY.

358
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,618
OH, LIEUTENANT,
TAKE A MESSAGE
TO STARFLEET COMMAND.

359
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,912
AYE, SIR.

360
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:49,623
AND DUE TO THE PROXIMITY
OF THE ROMULANS,
BETTER USE CODE 2.

361
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,835
BUT CAPTAIN,
THE ROMULANS HAVE
BROKEN CODE 2.

362
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,253
IF YOU REMEMBER
THE LAST BULLETIN--

363
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,089
THEN USE CODE 3.

364
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,424
YES, SIR. CODE 3.

365
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:03,262
MESSAGE: KEY TO AFFLICTION
MAY BE COMET WHICH PASSED
BY GAMMA HYDRA 4.

366
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,472
SAID COMET IS NOW...

367
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,268
QUADRANT 448, SIR.

368
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,478
UH, QUADRANT...

369
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,816
ALL UNITS
ARE TO BE ALERTED

370
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:19,445
FOR COMPLETE ANALYSIS
OF RADIATION AND MEANS
FOUND TO NEUTRALIZE IT

371
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,114
COMES AS HIGHLY DANGEROUS.

372
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,741
KIRK, COMMANDING
<i>ENTERPRISE...</i>

373
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,034
IMMEDIATELY, LIEUTENANT.
LET'S GO.

374
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,619
AYE, SIR.

375
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,205
OH, MR. SULU.

376
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,208
INCREASE ORBIT TO
20,000 MILE PARAGEE.

377
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,461
YOU MEAN ANOTHER
20,000, CAPTAIN?

378
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:46,264
I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
WHY EACH ONE OF MY COMMANDS

379
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,141
IS BEING QUESTIONED.

380
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,851
NOW, DO AS YOU'RE
TOLD, MR. SULU.

381
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,229
MR. SULU, WHAT IS
OUR PRESENT POSITION?

382
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,439
ORBITING AT
20,000, SIR.

383
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,247
MAINTAIN.

384
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,581
MAINTAINING, SIR.

385
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,753
RADIATION. WELL, THAT'S
AS GOOD AN ANSWER AS ANY,

386
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,213
BUT WHY DIDN'T WE
KNOW ABOUT IT EARLIER?

387
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,299
POSSIBLY, DOCTOR,
BECAUSE MY THINKING PROCESS

388
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:25,219
IS NOT AS EFFICIENT
AS BEFORE.

389
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,720
RUN THIS THROUGH,
DOCTOR.

390
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,222
ALL RIGHT, BONES.
I'M GOING UP TO
THE BRIDGE.

391
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,556
KEEP ME POSTED.
SPOCK?

392
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:34,478
I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR THE DOCTOR.

393
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:42,695
DOCTOR, SHIP'S TEMPERATURE
IS INCREASINGLY
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR ME.

394
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,199
I'VE ADJUSTED THE
ENVIRONMENT IN MY QUARTERS
TO 125 DEGREES,

395
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:47,616
WHICH IS AT LEAST
TOLERABLE.

396
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,285
HOWEVER, I--

397
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,955
WELL...I SEE I'M NOT
GONNA BE MAKING ANY
HOUSE CALLS ON YOU.

398
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,919
I WONDERED IF PERHAPS
THERE WAS SOMETHING WHICH COULD
LOWER MY SENSITIVITY TO COLD.

399
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,756
I'M NOT A MAGICIAN, SPOCK,
JUST AN OLD COUNTRY DOCTOR.

400
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,218
YES...

401
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,553
AS I ALWAYS
SUSPECTED.

402
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,229
DR. McCOY, NONE OF OUR
USUAL RADIATION THERAPIES

403
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:18,772
WILL HAVE ANY EFFECT
ON HIS RADIATION SICKNESS.

404
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,233
WELL, WE JUST START
OVER, THAT'S ALL.

405
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,776
WE WORK HARDER,
FASTER,

406
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,238
AND WE START
COMPLETELY FROM SCRATCH
IF WE HAVE TO,

407
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,614
BUT WE FIND SOMETHING.

408
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,200
Commodore: SPOCK.

409
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,617
CAN I HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU?

410
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:31,911
COMMODORE.

411
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,413
MR. SPOCK, A STARSHIP
CAN FUNCTION WITH A
CHIEF ENGINEER,

412
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:39,793
CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER,
EVEN THE FIRST OFFICER
UNDER PHYSICAL HARM.

413
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,296
BUT IT IS DISASTROUS
TO HAVE A COMMANDING
OFFICER WHOSE CONDITION

414
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,464
IS ANY LESS
THAN PERFECTION.

415
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,632
I AM AWARE OF THAT.

416
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,176
PLEASE UNDERSTAND ME.

417
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,636
MY ADMIRATION FOR
CAPTAIN KIRK IS
UNBOUNDED.

418
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,638
HE IS A GREAT OFFICER.

419
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,849
BUT MR. SPOCK, I...

420
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,060
I NEED YOUR HELP
AND YOUR COOPERATION.

421
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,770
FOR WHAT, SIR?

422
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:01,648
I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO TAKE OVER COMMAND
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

423
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,984
ON WHAT GROUNDS,
COMMODORE?

424
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,986
ON THE GROUNDS
THAT THE CAPTAIN,

425
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,405
BECAUSE OF HIS
AFFLICTION,

426
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,115
IS UNABLE TO PERFORM
HIS DUTIES.

427
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,577
NEED I REMIND YOU, SIR,
THAT I, TOO, CONTRACTED
THE SAME AFFLICTION?

428
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,246
YES, BUT YOU'RE
A VULCAN.

429
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,206
YOU HAVE A MUCH
GREATER LIFESPAN.

430
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,540
YOU SHOW THE EFFECTS
TO A MUCH SMALLER
DEGREE.

431
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,418
I'M HALF HUMAN, SIR.

432
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,796
MY PHYSICAL REFLEXES
ARE DOWN. MY MENTAL
CAPACITY IS REDUCED.

433
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:28,801
I TIRE EASILY.
NO. SIR. I AM NOT
FIT FOR COMMAND.

434
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:33,222
WELL, IF YOU ARE NOT,
WITH YOUR VULCAN
PHYSIQUE,

435
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,474
THEN OBVIOUSLY CAPTAIN
KIRK CANNOT BE.

436
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,397
SIR, I DO HAVE
DUTIES TO PERFORM.

437
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,149
MR. SPOCK.

438
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,192
I DO NOT LIKE WHAT
I'M ABOUT TO SAY,

439
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,278
BUT REGULATIONS
DEMAND IT.

440
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,157
AND AS A STARFLEET
FLAG OFFICER, I MUST
FOLLOW REGULATIONS.

441
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,784
AS SECOND IN COMMAND
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

442
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,455
YOU MUST CONVENE
AN EXTRAORDINARY
COMPETENCY HEARING.

443
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:02,751
I RESIST THAT
SUGGESTION, COMMODORE.

444
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,838
IT'S NOT A MATTER
OF CHOICE.

445
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,216
WHEN A CAPTAIN IS UNFIT,
PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY,

446
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,093
A COMPETENCY HEARING
IS MANDATORY.

447
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,637
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
QUOTE A REGULATION

448
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,473
WHICH YOU KNOW
AS WELL AS I DO.

449
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,228
VERY WELL, SIR.

450
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,564
HEARING SHALL CONVENE
AT 1400 HOURS.

451
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,075
NOW, THIS ISN'T
GONNA HURT A BIT.

452
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,619
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
THE LAST TIME.

453
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,745
DID IT HURT?

454
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,456
YES.

455
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,750
UHH!

456
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,461
OHH!

457
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,546
BONES.

458
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,803
SHE'S DEAD.

459
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,682
HER METABOLISM CAUSED
HER TO AGE MORE RAPIDLY
THAN THE REST OF US,

460
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,228
BUT THE SAME THING'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO US
UNLESS...

461
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,230
HOW LONG HAVE WE
GOT, BONES?

462
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:10,444
OH...MATTER OF DAYS,
PERHAPS HOURS.

463
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,417
Spock: LET IT READ THAT THIS
COMPETENCY HEARING WAS ORDERED
BY COMMODORE STOCKER

464
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,335
AND RELUCTANTLY CALLED
BY MYSELF.

465
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,588
LET IT ALSO READ
THAT I CONSIDER IT
INVALID.

466
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,968
MR. SPOCK,
MAY I MAKE A STATEMENT?

467
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:39,390
I HAVE HAD TO RESORT TO
THESE LEGAL GROUNDS IN ORDER
TO SAVE THE LIVES

468
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,184
OF SOME VERY VALUABLE
MEMBERS OF THE STARFLEET.

469
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:47,273
I HAVE TRIED TO CONVINCE
CAPTAIN KIRK OF THE NECESSITY
OF PROCEEDING TO STARBASE 10,

470
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,983
BUT I'VE BEEN OVERRULED
IN EACH CASE.

471
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,195
THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS HEARING IS MINE.

472
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,030
ON THE CONTRARY,
COMMODORE.

473
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:59,368
AS PRESIDING OFFICER
AND AS SECOND IN COMMAND
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

474
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,662
THE RESPONSIBILITY
IS MINE.

475
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,375
CAPTAIN KIRK,

476
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,461
YOU LIKE TO MAKE
A STATEMENT?

477
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,629
YES, I WOULD LIKE
TO MAKE A STATEMENT.

478
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,802
I AM THE CAPTAIN
OF THIS SHIP

479
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:20,514
AND AM TOTALLY CAPABLE
OF COMMANDING HER.

480
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,975
NOW LET'S CALL THIS
WHOLE THING OFF AND
GET BACK TO WORK.

481
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,437
IT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE,
CAPTAIN.

482
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,939
REGULATIONS ARE
QUITE SPECIFIC.

483
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,318
YOU ARE ENTITLED TO
DIRECT EXAMINATION
OF ALL WITNESSES

484
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,362
IMMEDIATELY AFTER
THE BOARD HAS
QUESTIONED THEM.

485
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,615
VERY KIND OF YOU,
SPOCK.

486
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,452
MR. SULU,

487
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,661
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
SERVED WITH CAPTAIN KIRK?

488
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,623
TWO YEARS, SIR.

489
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,874
TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, HAS HE
EVER HAD ANY DIFFICULTY
MAKING DECISIONS?

490
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,002
NO, SIR.

491
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,087
DID HE ORDER YOU
TO MAINTAIN STANDARD ORBIT

492
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,380
AROUND GAMMA HYDRA 4?

493
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,048
YES, SIR.

494
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,092
DID HE NOT,
SEVERAL MINUTES LATER,

495
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,512
REPEAT THAT ORDER?

496
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,054
YES, SIR.

497
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,807
DID HE ORDER YOU
TO INCREASE ORBIT?

498
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,351
YES, SIR.

499
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:08,020
AND NOT SEVERAL
MINUTES LATER REPEAT
THAT ORDER?

500
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,896
HE DID NOT!

501
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,401
WHEN I GIVE AN ORDER,
I EXPECT IT TO BE OBEYED.

502
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,654
I DON'T HAVE TO
REPEAT MYSELF.

503
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,955
MR. SULU...

504
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,666
PLEASE
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

505
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,379
YES, SIR.

506
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,797
CAPTAIN KIRK
REPEATED HIS ORDER.

507
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,633
THANK YOU, MR. SULU.

508
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,643
YEOMAN ATKINS...

509
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,190
YOU HANDED CAPTAIN KIRK
A FUEL CONSUMPTION REPORT

510
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,526
IN THE PRESENCE
OF WITNESSES

511
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:59,405
WHICH HE READ AND SIGNED.
IS THAT CORRECT?

512
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,781
SIR, HE HAD MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS
ON HIS MIND.

513
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,033
YEOMAN,

514
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,661
YOU WILL SIMPLY
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

515
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,623
I...

516
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,294
I GUESS HE FORGOT
HE'D SIGNED IT.

517
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,213
YOU GUESS.

518
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,215
HE'D FORGOT
HE'D SIGNED IT.

519
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,343
THANK YOU, YEOMAN.

520
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,636
YOU MAY LEAVE.

521
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:31,645
LIEUTENANT UHURA...

522
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,277
I HAVE HERE A BULLETIN
FROM STARFLEET COMMAND

523
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:42,239
WHICH STATES THAT
THE ROMULANS HAVE
BROKEN CODE 2.

524
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,200
ARE THESE YOUR
INITIALS WHICH APPEAR
AT THE BOTTOM?

525
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,535
THEY ARE.

526
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,827
AND WHOSE INITIALS
ARE THOSE

527
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,497
WHICH APPEAR DIRECTLY
BELOW YOURS?

528
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:51,665
THOSE OF CAPTAIN KIRK.

529
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,378
DID CAPTAIN KIRK
ASK YOU TO SEND
A MESSAGE

530
00:29:56,503 --> 00:30:00,173
ABOUT THE COMET
WHICH PASSED
GAMMA HYDRA 4?

531
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,508
HE DID.

532
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,927
USING CODE 2.

533
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,556
OH, YES, BUT HE
CHANGED IT TO CODE 3.

534
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:13,353
AFTER YOU REMINDED HIM
THAT THE ROMULANS
HAD BROKEN CODE 2.

535
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,938
YES.

536
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,607
THANK YOU, LIEUTENANT.

537
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,612
DR. McCOY...

538
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,658
DR. McCOY!

539
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:27,951
YE-YES, SPOCK?

540
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,412
WHAT IS IT?

541
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,580
SEVERAL HOURS AGO,

542
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,956
AT THE REQUEST
OF THIS BOARD,

543
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,959
YOU RAN A COMPLETE
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
OF CAPTAIN KIRK.

544
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,753
I DID.

545
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,631
MEDICAL BANKS,
COMPUTE

546
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,592
AND DESCRIBE SUBJECT'S
PHYSICAL AGE,

547
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,469
USING ESTABLISHED NORMS
AS COMPARATIVE BASE.

548
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,888
<i>WORKING. SUBJECT'S</i>
<i>PHYSICAL AGE</i>

549
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,350
<i>BASED ON PHYSIOLOGICAL</i>
<i>PROFILE.</i>

550
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,560
<i>BETWEEN 60 AND 72.</i>

551
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,395
<i>AGING RAPIDLY.</i>

552
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:56,980
NO, I'M 34--

553
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,608
I'M 34 YEARS OLD.

554
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,902
THE COMPUTER DIFFERS
WITH YOU, CAPTAIN.

555
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,780
DR. McCOY...

556
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,698
YES.

557
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,034
WILL YOU GIVE US
YOUR PROFESSIONAL
EVALUATION

558
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,662
OF CAPTAIN KIRK'S
PRESENT PHYSICAL CONDITION?

559
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,667
OH...CAPTAIN KIRK
IS SUFFERING FROM A...

560
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:22,005
A PECULIAR
PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

561
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,133
WHICH STRONGLY
RESEMBLES AGING.

562
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,637
IS NOT HIS MENTAL
CAPACITY DEGENERATING
EVEN MORE RAPIDLY?

563
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:34,643
YES, YES, BUT HE'S
A BETTER MAN RIGHT NOW--

564
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:38,564
DOCTOR, YOU HEARD
THE COMPUTER'S ANALYSIS

565
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,983
OF CAPTAIN KIRK'S
PHYSICAL AGE.

566
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,318
DO YOU AGREE WITH IT?

567
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,487
THESE BLASTED MACHINES,
SPOCK.

568
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,114
YOU CAN'T ARGUE
WITH A MACHINE.

569
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,661
DO YOU AGREE WITH IT,
DOCTOR?

570
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,421
YES.

571
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,631
YES, I DO...AGREE.

572
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,637
AND I AM SORRY, JIM.

573
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,079
THIS BOARD HAS
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS...

574
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,623
UNLESS YOU,
COMMODORE STOCKER,

575
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,793
HAVE SOMETHING
THAT YOU WOULD
LIKE TO ADD.

576
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,629
NO. I AM...
QUITE SATISFIED,
MR. SPOCK.

577
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,676
DO YOU WISH TO CALL
ANY WITNESSES,
CAPTAIN KIRK?

578
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,428
HEH HEH HEH.

579
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:55,891
I AM PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF SPEAKING IN MY
OWN DEFENSE, MR. SPOCK.

580
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,392
CAPTAIN,
I WOULD SUGGEST--

581
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,269
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SPOCK.

582
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,730
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

583
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,482
THERE'S ONLY
ONE REASON...

584
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,360
AND ONE REASON ALONE...

585
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,570
FOR HAVING THIS...

586
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,155
HEARING.

587
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,616
I REFUSED TO LEAVE
GAMMA HYDRA 2.

588
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,287
GAMMA HYDRA 4,
CAPTAIN.

589
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,956
YES. A SLIP OF THE TONGUE.

590
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,752
CAPTAIN, YOUR INABILITY
TO REMEMBER HAVING
GIVEN COMMANDS,

591
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,254
READING AND SIGNING
IMPORTANT ORDERS

592
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,214
AND THEN
FORGETTING THEM,

593
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,133
YOUR PHYSICAL ANALYSIS
AS COMPILED BY

594
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,177
OUR OWN CHIEF SURGEON--

595
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,012
ALL THESE THINGS
WOULD APPEAR TO BE

596
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,641
IRREFUTABLE PROOF OF
FAILING PHYSICAL AND
MENTAL CONDITIONS.

597
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,185
SO I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

598
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,937
WHO WOULDN'T BE
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

599
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,272
MY SHIP'S IN TROUBLE,
MY SENIOR OFFICERS ARE ILL.

600
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,191
AND THIS NONSENSE

601
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,360
ABOUT A COMPETENCY HEARING

602
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,612
IS ENOUGH TO MIX UP
ANY MAN.

603
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:56,493
TRYING TO RELIEVE A CAPTAIN
OF HIS COMMAND IS...

604
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,704
WELL, THAT'S...

605
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,622
THAT'S...

606
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:08,630
SPOCK...

607
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,632
I WOULDN'T HAVE
BELIEVED IT OF YOU.

608
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,807
ALL RIGHT,
ASK ME QUESTIONS.

609
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,225
I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

610
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,435
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH MY MEMORY.

611
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,270
GO AHEAD!
ASK ME ANYTHING!

612
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,610
WE'RE IN ORBIT
AROUND GAMMA HYDRA 2,
RIGHT?

613
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,661
ANYHOW,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

614
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,581
THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO RUNNING A STARSHIP

615
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:46,167
THAN ANSWERING
A LOT OF FOOL QUESTIONS.

616
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,754
A LOT MORE.

617
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,547
GO AHEAD.
ASK ME QUESTIONS.

618
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,007
WE HAVE NO MORE
QUESTIONS, CAPTAIN.

619
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,425
ASK ME ANYTHING.

620
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,801
HEH HEH HEH.

621
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,636
ANYTHING.

622
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:03,101
THERE'LL BE
NO MORE QUESTIONS,
CAPTAIN.

623
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:08,941
IF YOU WOULD LEAVE THE ROOM
SO THE BOARD CAN VOTE...

624
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,358
GOOD IDEA.

625
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,484
GET THIS STUPID
VOTING OVER WITH

626
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,486
SO I CAN GET BACK
TO RUNNING THE SHIP.

627
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,114
THE MOST FOOL THING
I EVER HEARD OF.

628
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,199
A COMPETENCY HEARING
WHEN THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE.

629
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,803
I'LL BE IN MY QUARTERS...

630
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,638
AWAITING YOUR DECISION.

631
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:58,531
WELL, SINCE
THE SENIOR OFFICERS
ARE INCAPABLE

632
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,866
AND I AM OF FLAG RANK,

633
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,577
I AM FORCED BY REGULATIONS
TO ASSUME COMMAND.

634
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,288
SIR, YOU HAVE NEVER
COMMANDED A STARSHIP.

635
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,332
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE,
MR. SPOCK,

636
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,043
A JUNIOR OFFICER
WITH FAR LESS EXPERIENCE
THAN I HAVE?

637
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,670
THE DANGER
FROM THE ROMULANS--

638
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,630
MR. SPOCK, WE HAVE TO
SAVE THESE PEOPLE.

639
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,342
MR. SULU...

640
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:21,429
SET A DIRECT COURSE
FOR STARBASE 10.
WARP 5.

641
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,806
ACROSS THE NEUTRAL ZONE?

642
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,641
IMMEDIATELY, MR. SULU.

643
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,645
ALL OFFICERS ARE
TO RETURN TO THEIR POSTS.

644
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,657
SPOCK?

645
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,618
YES, CAPTAIN.

646
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,914
SO...

647
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,666
I'VE BEEN RELIEVED.

648
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,752
I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN.

649
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,004
YES.

650
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,548
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN
A PROSECUTING ATTORNEY.

651
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:57,841
REGULATIONS REQUIRE--

652
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,801
REGULATIONS.
DON'T GIVE ME REGULATIONS.

653
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,469
YOU'VE WANTED COMMAND
ALL ALONG.

654
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,762
FIRST LITTLE EXCUSE
YOU GET--

655
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,639
CAPTAIN, I HAVE NOT
ASSUMED COMMAND.

656
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,399
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

657
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,985
YOU'VE--YOU'VE
NOT ASSUMED COMMAND?

658
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,486
I SUFFER THE SAME
AFFLICTION
AS YOU, SIR.

659
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,280
IF YOU'RE NOT IN COMMAND,
WHO IS?

660
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,407
COMMODORE STOCKER.

661
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,950
STOCKER?

662
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:26,078
ARE YOU CRAZY?

663
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,038
HE'S NEVER HAD
A FIELD COMMAND.

664
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,248
MR. SCOTT WAS
UNFIT FOR COMMAND.

665
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,833
COMMODORE STOCKER
IS RANKING OFFICER--

666
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,586
NO! DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT RANK!

667
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,505
THE MAN'S
A CHAIR-BOUND PAPER-PUSHER.

668
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,798
I ORDER YOU
TO TAKE COMMAND.

669
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,633
I CANNOT, CAPTAIN.

670
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,847
ARE YOU REFUSING
A DIRECT ORDER?

671
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,140
NO, SIR.

672
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,102
ONLY COMMODORE STOCKER
CAN GIVE A COMMAND ORDER

673
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:51,394
ONBOARD THIS SHIP.

674
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,645
YOU TRAITOROUS...

675
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,524
DISLOYAL...

676
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:00,779
YOU STAB ME IN THE BACK
THE FIRST CHANCE YOU GET.

677
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:01,654
SPOCK...

678
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:10,413
GET OUT.

679
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,624
I NEVER WANT TO
HAVE TO LOOK AT YOU AGAIN.

680
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,646

OH, JIM. I'M SORRY.

DOESN'T MAKE A MAN OLD.

AND YOU
DON'T RUN A STARSHIP
WITH YOUR ARMS.

YOU RUN IT
WITH YOUR HEAD.

AS IT EVER WAS.

OF RADIATION POISONING,

A LITTLE GRAY,

DOING HERE?

OF THE MOST USE.

FOR A FEW MOMENTS.

00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,760
HE WAS SCARED!

726
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:29,886
HE SAW THE DEAD BODY

727
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,637
AND HE RAN OUT
OF THE BUILDING.

728
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,265
AND HE WAS SCARED TO DEATH.

ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE,
SHIELDS FAILING.

860
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:32,665
WILL IMPLEMENT DESTRUCT ORDER
USING COBRAMITE DEVICE

861
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,542
RECENTLY INSTALLED.

862
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,796
SINCE THIS WILL RESULT
IN THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

863
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:43,551
AND ALL MATTER WITHIN
A 200,000-KILOMETER DIAMETER

864
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:46,721
AND ESTABLISH
A CORRESPONDING DEAD ZONE,

865
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,973
ALL FEDERATION SHIPS
WILL AVOID THIS AREA

866
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:52,101
FOR THE NEXT
FOUR SOLAR YEARS.

867
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,353
EXPLOSION WILL TAKE PLACE
IN ONE MINUTE.

868
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:57,356
KIRK, COMMANDING
<i>ENTERPRISE,</i> OUT.

869
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,775
MR. SULU,

870
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,320
COURSE 1-8-8 DEGREES,
MARK 14.

871
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,989
SPEED...WARP FACTOR 8.

872
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,699
STAND BY.

873
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:08,534
STANDING BY, SIR.

874
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:14,123
ROMULANS GIVING GROUND,
CAPTAIN.

875
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,126
OBVIOUSLY, THEY TAPPED IN
AS YOU EXPECTED THEM TO.

876
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,252
A LOGICAL ASSUMPTION,
MR. SPOCK.

877
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,836
ARE THEY
STILL RETREATING?

878
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:20,963
YES, SIR.

879
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,089
GOOD.

880
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,551
ALL HANDS, STAND BY.

881
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,556
WARP FACTOR 8...NOW.

882
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,946
THE ROMULANS WERE
CAUGHT OFF-GUARD,
CAPTAIN.

883
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,657
THEY'RE FALLING BEHIND.

884
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:48,533
ARE WE OUT OF RANGE,
MR. SULU?

885
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,660
YES, SIR, AND OUT OF
THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

886
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:57,124
SECURE FROM RED ALERT.
ADJUST A NEW COURSE--
2-5-7 DEGREES, MARK 3,

887
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,835
HEADING FOR STARBASE 10.

888
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,003
2-5-7 DEGREES,
MARK 3.

889
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,339
CAPTAIN, I...

890
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,007
JUST WANTED TO ASSURE YOU

891
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,802
THAT I DID WHAT
I THOUGHT BEST TO SAVE
BOTH YOU AND THE MEN.

892
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,556
NOTED. YOU SHOULD KNOW,
HOWEVER, THERE'S VERY
LITTLE A STARBASE CAN DO

893
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:13,516
THAT A STARSHIP CAN'T.

894
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,767
IF I MAY SAY SO,
CAPTAIN,

895
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,395
I'M NOW QUITE AWARE
OF WHAT A STARSHIP
CAN DO...

896
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,023
WITH THE RIGHT MAN
AT THE HELM.

897
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,192
[DOOR OPENS]

898
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,901
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD,
DOC.

899
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,612
FEELING FINE.
SO IS SCOTTY.

900
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:27,946
SERUM WORKED.

901
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,448
PULLED A MUSCLE
DURING THE REACTION,

902
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:30,867
BUT OTHERWISE
HE'S FEELING FINE.

903
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:31,576
AND YOURSELF?

904
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,703
VERY WELL. A FEW BRUISES
HERE AND THERE.

905
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:34,412
OH.

906
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,955
ANYTIME YOU'RE
READY, MR. SPOCK.

907
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:40,334
I AM QUITE READY NOW,
DOCTOR.

908
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,294
BECAUSE OF
YOUR VULCAN PHYSIQUE,

909
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,130
I HAVE PREPARED
AN EXTREMELY POTENT
SHOT FOR YOU.

910
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,883
HOWEVER,
I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW

911
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,510
I'VE REMOVED
ALL THE BREAKABLES
FROM SICK BAY.

912
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,221
THAT'S VERY CONSIDERATE
OF YOU, DOCTOR.

913
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,598
I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE PLEASED TO HEAR THAT.

914
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,061
WELL, GENTLEMEN,
ALL AND ALL,

915
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,565
AN EXPERIENCE
WE'LL REMEMBER
IN OUR OLD AGE...

916
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:07,486
WHICH WON'T BE
FOR SOME WHILE, I HOPE.

917
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:08,571
TAKE OVER, MR. SULU.

918
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,698
STEADY AS SHE GOES.

919
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,909
STEADY AS SHE GOES,
CAPTAIN.

920
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,201
I THOUGHT I SAID THAT.
