1
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,725
NO LIFE FORM READINGS,
CAPTAIN.

2
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:17,977
CONTINUING SCAN.

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,604
WELL, SOMEBODY SENT
A DISTRESS CALL.

4
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,063
NO SIGN OF
THE SPACESHIP.

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,191
NO SIGN OF DEBRIS.

6
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,444
I AM
GETTING READINGS

7
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,781
ON SMALL
METALLIC OBJECTS,
CAPTAIN.

8
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,908
IT'S POSSIBLE
THE SHIP WAS
DESTROYED IN SPACE

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,328
AND THE SURVIVORS
PROCEEDED HERE
IN A SHUTTLE CRAFT.

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,788
BUT WHERE ARE THEY?

11
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,874
CAPTAIN, I'M GETTING
A READING NOW.

12
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:43,961
TWO HUMAN FORMS
AT BEARING 300
MARK 7.

13
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,587
CONFIRMED.

14
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,404
I'M CAPTAIN
JAMES T. KIRK

15
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,406
OF THE STARSHIP
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>

16
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,575
WE CAME IN ANSWER
TO YOUR DISTRESS CALL.

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,828
IT WAS VERY KIND OF YOU
TO RESPOND SO QUICKLY.

18
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,041
NOW YOU WILL SURRENDER
YOUR SHIP TO ME.

19
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,630
YOU HAVE A VERY STRANGE
SENSE OF HUMOR, MR...

20
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,562
I AM ROJAN OF KELVA.

21
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,522
I AM YOUR COMMANDER

22
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,566
FROM THIS MOMENT ON.

23
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,738
ANY EFFORTS
TO RESIST US...

24
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,282
OR TO ESCAPE...

25
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,534
WILL BE
SEVERELY PUNISHED.

26
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,955
SOON WE...

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,623
AND YOU...

28
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:06,501
WILL LEAVE
THIS GALAXY FOREVER.

29
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,003
YOU HUMANS...

30
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:13,675
MUST FACE THE END
OF YOUR EXISTENCE
AS YOU HAVE KNOWN IT.

31
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,395
<i>SPACE...</i>

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,481
<i>A FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

33
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:37,532
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE.

34
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,993
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

35
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,536
<i>TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>STRANGE NEW WORLDS,</i>

36
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,373
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,</i>

37
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,458
<i>TO BOLDLY GO</i>

38
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,711
<i>WHERE NO MAN</i>
<i>HAS GONE BEFORE.</i>

39
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,136
YOU ARE ALL PARALYZED
BY A SELECTIVE FIELD

40
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,929
THAT NEUTRALIZES
NERVE IMPULSES

41
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,264
TO THE VOLUNTARY MUSCLES.

42
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,143
WE CAN CONTROL YOU
AT WILL.

43
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,895
I WILL NOW RELEASE YOU.

44
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,812
[BEEP]

45
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,022
CAPTAIN.

46
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,439
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

47
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,607
INTERESTING.

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,525
A NEURAL FIELD?

49
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,153
YES. RADIATING
FROM A CENTRAL
PROJECTOR.

50
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,196
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,906
YOUR SHIP,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

52
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,074
IT WILL
SERVE US WELL

53
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,950
IN THE LONG VOYAGE.

54
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,202
VOYAGE? WHERE?

55
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,244
TO YOUR
NEIGHBORING GALAXY,

56
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,663
WHICH YOU CALL
ANDROMEDA.

57
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,664
ANDROMEDA?

58
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,916
WHY?

59
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,584
IT IS OUR HOME.

60
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,045
WHAT BRINGS
YOU HERE?

61
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,504
WITHIN 10 MILLENNIA,

62
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,925
HIGH RADIATION LEVELS
IN OUR GALAXY

63
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,467
WILL MAKE LIFE THERE
IMPOSSIBLE.

64
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,470
SO THE KELVAN EMPIRE
SENT FORTH SHIPS

65
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,098
TO EXPLORE
OTHER GALAXIES,

66
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,640
TO SEARCH FOR ONE

67
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,643
WHICH OUR RACE
COULD CONQUER AND OCCUPY.

68
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,979
WELL, SORRY. THIS GALAXY
IS ALREADY OCCUPIED.

69
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:35,358
CAPTAIN, YOU THINK
YOU ARE UNCONQUERABLE

70
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,402
AND YOUR SHIP
IMPREGNABLE,

71
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,529
BUT WHILE WE'VE TALKED,

72
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,823
THE CAPTURE
HAS ALREADY BEGUN.

73
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,077
SOMETHING PENETRATING
FROM THE PLANET.

74
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,495
INCREASE POWER
TO SHIELDS.

75
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,549
IT'S DEAD, SIR.
ALL MAJOR POWER DISABLED.

76
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,135
SOUND RED ALERT.

77
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,219
RED ALERT.
ALL PERSONNEL

78
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,179
MAN YOUR
BATTLE STATIONS.

79
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,847
GO TO RED ALERT.

80
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,397
ENGINEERING,
COME IN.

81
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,024
LIFE SUPPORT,
COME IN.

82
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,459
DREA, TOMAR, REPORT.

83
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,211
LIFE SUPPORT CONTROL,
SECURE.

84
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,130
ENGINEERING
IS SECURE.

85
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,547
ROJAN,
HANAR HERE.

86
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,132
REPORT, HANAR.

87
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,050
<i>THE SHIP IS OURS.</i>

88
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,677
<i>WE CONTROL THE BRIDGE,</i>
<i>ENGINEERING,</i>

89
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,137
<i>AND LIFE SUPPORT</i>
<i>SYSTEMS.</i>

90
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,014
PROCEED WITH
YOUR ORDERS.

91
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,272
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF CAPTURING MY SHIP?

92
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,523
EVEN AT MAXIMUM WARP,

93
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,274
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
COULDN'T REACH ANDROMEDA

94
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,317
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

95
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,402
CAPTAIN, WE WILL
MODIFY ITS ENGINES

96
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,487
IN ORDER TO
PRODUCE VELOCITIES

97
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,532
FAR BEYOND THE REACH
OF YOUR SCIENCE.

98
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,574
THE JOURNEY
BETWEEN GALAXIES

99
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,579
WILL TAKE LESS THAN
300 OF YOUR YEARS.

100
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,581
FASCINATING.

101
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,584
INTERGALACTIC TRAVEL
REQUIRING ONLY 300 YEARS?

102
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,170
THAT IS A LEAP

103
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,797
FAR BEYOND ANYTHING
MAN HAS YET ACCOMPLISHED.

104
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,259
YOU MADE A VOYAGE
OF 300 YEARS?

105
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,138
OUR SHIPS WERE OF
MULTIGENERATION DESIGN.

106
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,682
WE WERE BORN IN
THE INTERGALACTIC VOID.

107
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,352
WE SHALL DIE THERE
DURING OUR RETURN JOURNEY.

108
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,270
OUR MISSION
WILL BE COMPLETED

109
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,313
BY A COMMANDER WHO IS
MY DESCENDANT.

110
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,397
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SHIP?

111
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,774
THERE IS
AN ENERGY BARRIER

112
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,360
AT THE RIM
OF YOUR GALAXY.

113
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,777
YES, I KNOW.
WE'VE BEEN THERE.

114
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,530
WE MANAGED TO BREAK THROUGH IT
WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY.

115
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,865
OUR SHIP WAS DESTROYED.

116
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,909
WE BARELY MANAGED
TO ESCAPE

117
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,577
IN A LIFE CRAFT.

118
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,786
AND NOW...

119
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,581
WE HAVE THE MEANS
TO BEGIN OUR JOURNEY

120
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,208
BACK TO ANDROMEDA.

121
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,751
WHY USE OUR VESSEL?

122
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,670
WHY NOT
TRANSMIT A MESSAGE
TO YOUR GALAXY?

123
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,797
NO FORM OF TRANSMISSION
CAN PENETRATE THE BARRIER.

124
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,383
ROJAN,

125
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,261
THERE'S NO REASON
TO DO THIS BY FORCE.

126
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,679
LET'S TAKE YOUR PROBLEM
TO THE FEDERATION.

127
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,348
RESEARCH EXPEDITIONS

128
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,309
HAVE CATALOGUED HUNDREDS
OF UNINHABITED PLANETS
IN THIS GALAXY

129
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,061
SUITABLE
FOR COLONIZATION.

130
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,979
WE DO NOT COLONIZE.

131
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,480
WE CONQUER.

132
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,233
WE RULE.

133
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,944
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
FOR US.

134
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,404
IN OTHER WORDS,

135
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,072
THE GALAXY
ISN'T BIG ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.

136
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,574
THE FEDERATION
HAS HANDLED FOREIGN
INVASIONS BEFORE.

137
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,576
CAPTAIN, WE CAN CONTROL
THE FEDERATION

138
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,579
AS EASILY AS WE
CAN CONTROL YOU.

139
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,129
THE FATE OF THE INFERIOR
IN ANY GALAXY.

140
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,759
ALL IS PROCEEDING
ACCORDING TO PLAN, ROJAN.

141
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,054
KELINDA, TAKE THEM
TO THE HOLDING AREA.

142
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,807
WE'LL KEEP YOU
AND YOUR PARTY HERE,
CAPTAIN.

143
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,851
YOUR CREW WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY WISH
TO COOPERATE WITH US

144
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,187
IF THEY UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ARE HOSTAGES.

145
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:05,526
Kelinda:
MOVE THERE.

146
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,160
TOMAR HAS EXAMINED
THE SHIP.

147
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,619
THE MODIFICATIONS
ARE UNDERWAY.

148
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,416
SPACE AGAIN, HANAR.

149
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,502
I DO NOT THINK
WE COULD HAVE
KEPT OUR SANITY

150
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,464
LIVING TOO LONG
ON THIS ACCURSED PLANET.

151
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,881
IT IS AN UNDISCIPLINED
ENVIRONMENT.

152
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,467
ONE CANNOT CONTROL IT.

153
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,678
YET THERE ARE
THINGS OF INTEREST.

154
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,805
YES, BUT DISTURBING.

155
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,558
THESE SHELLS IN WHICH
WE'VE ENCASED OURSELVES,

156
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,936
THEY HAVE SUCH
HEIGHTENED SENSES.

157
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,813
TO FEEL...

158
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,814
TO HEAR...

159
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,316
TO SMELL.

160
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,693
HOW DO HUMANS
MANAGE TO EXIST

161
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,320
IN THESE
FRAGILE CASES?

162
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,696
SINCE THE SHIP
WAS DESIGNED

163
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,323
TO SUSTAIN
THESE FORMS,

164
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,657
WE HAVE
LITTLE CHOICE.

165
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,705
AT LEAST WE'LL BE AWAY
FROM ALL OF THIS OPENNESS.

166
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,459
NO, THIS IS TOO STRANGE
FOR US, HANAR.

167
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,712
WE ARE CREATURES
OF OUTER SPACE.

168
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:06,963
SOON...

169
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,465
WE WILL BE SAFE

170
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,759
IN THE COMFORTING
CLOSENESS OF WALLS.

171
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,096
FASCINATING MATERIAL.

172
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,098
SIMILAR TO DIBERNIUM,

173
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,225
BUT CONSIDERABLY
MORE DENSE.

174
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,601
I DOUBT EVEN
PHASER FIRE

175
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,936
COULD DISTURB
ITS MOLECULAR STRUCTURE.

176
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,604
WE CAN'T BREAK OUT.

177
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,939
THERE MUST BE
ANOTHER WAY.

178
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,441
CAPTAIN,
WHO DO THEY WANT
FROM US?

179
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,817
WHAT KIND
OF PEOPLE ARE THEY?

180
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,569
THAT'S A VERY GOOD
QUESTION.

181
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,987
THEY REGISTERED
AS HUMAN.

182
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:31,988
NO, DOCTOR.

183
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,573
MORE THAN THAT.

184
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,076
THEY REGISTERED AS PERFECT
HUMAN LIFE FORMS.

185
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,161
I RECALL NOTING

186
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,706
THE READINGS WERE
ALMOST CLASSIC
TEXTBOOK RESPONSES.

187
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,332
MOST CURIOUS.

188
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,292
SPOCK, WHAT
ARE THE ODDS

189
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,711
IN SUCH ABSOLUTE
DUPLICATION OF LIFE FORMS

190
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,255
IN ANOTHER GALAXY?

191
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,882
THE CHANCES
ARE VERY MUCH
AGAINST IT.

192
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,426
CAPTAIN, CAPTAIN.

193
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,431
HOWEVER PERFECT
THEY ARE,

194
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,517
THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE
VERY MANY OF THEM.

195
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,477
THEY HAVE
THE PARALYSIS FIELD.

196
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,730
ROJAN MENTIONED
SOMETHING ABOUT A...

197
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,774
CENTRAL PROJECTOR.

198
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,483
YES.

199
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,403
IF WE COULD PUT THAT
OUT OF OPERATION,

200
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,653
WE MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE.

201
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,573
GENTLEMEN, I'M
CONSTRAINED TO POINT OUT

202
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,157
WE DO NOT EVEN KNOW

203
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,617
WHAT THIS PROJECTOR
LOOKS LIKE.

204
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,659
THOSE DEVICES ON THEIR BELTS

205
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,912
MIGHT INDICATE THE SOURCE
OF THE FORCE FIELD.

206
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:21,580
POSSIBLE.

207
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,706
I WOULD HAVE
TO HAVE ONE
TO EXAMINE.

208
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,333
YOU'LL HAVE ONE, SIR,

209
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,168
IF I HAVE TO RIP
ONE OF THE KELVINS
APART TO GET IT.

210
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,129
YOU'LL
GET YOUR CHANCE,

211
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,255
BUT YOU'LL DO IT
UNDER ORDERS.

212
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,548
YES, SIR.

213
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,552
ON EMINIAR SEVEN,

214
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,971
YOU WERE ABLE
TO TRICK THE GUARD

215
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,556
BY A VULCAN MIND PROBE.

216
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,432
AS I RECALL,
CAPTAIN,

217
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,559
I LED HIM TO BELIEVE
WE HAD ESCAPED.

218
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,978
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN?

219
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,646
I SHALL ATTEMPT IT.

220
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,455
YOU ALL RIGHT?

221
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,998
YES, I WILL
BE ALL RIGHT,
CAPTAIN.

222
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,125
WE MUST HURRY.

223
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,934
[BEEP]

224
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,145
THIS CANNOT GO
UNPUNISHED.

225
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,523
HANAR.

226
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,528
THAT ONE.

227
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,863
TAKE HIM ASIDE.

228
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,075
KELINDA.

229
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,742
THE FEMALE.

230
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,085
CAPTAIN.

231
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,628
GO.

232
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,555
AS A LEADER,

233
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,557
YOU REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE
OF DISCIPLINE.

234
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,643
I NEED YOU AND
THESE OTHER SPECIALISTS,

235
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,562
BUT THOSE TWO
ARE UNNECESSARY.

236
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,525
I'M RESPONSIBLE.
LET THEM GO.

237
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,569
I THINK WE'RE
SOMEWHAT ALIKE, CAPTAIN.

238
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,488
EACH OF US CARES
LESS FOR HIS OWN SAFETY

239
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,491
THAN FOR THE LIVES
OF HIS COMMAND.

240
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,578
WE FEEL PAIN
WHEN OTHERS SUFFER
FOR OUR MISTAKES.

241
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,372
YOUR PUNISHMENT SHALL BE
TO WATCH THEM DIE.

242
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,625
CAPTAIN...

243
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,586
PROCEED, HANAR.

244
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,027
BRING THEM TO ME.

245
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,666
THIS IS THE ESSENCE
OF WHAT THEY WERE.

246
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,293
THE FLESH AND BRAIN

247
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,295
AND WHAT YOU CALL...

248
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,046
A PERSONALITY,

249
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,592
DISTILLED DOWN
INTO THESE COMPACT SHAPES.

250
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,805
ONCE CRUSHED...

251
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,360
THIS PERSON IS DEAD.

252
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,408
HOWEVER...

253
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,205
THAT ONE CAN BE RESTORED.

254
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,957
HANAR.

255
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,234
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 4657.5.</i>

256
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,778
<i>WORK IS PROCEEDING</i>
<i>ON THE</i> ENTERPRISE

257
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,781
<i>AS MY CREW IS FORCED TO</i>
<i>MAKE THE REQUIRED CHANGES</i>

258
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,783
<i>IN THE SHIP</i>
<i>FOR INTERGALACTIC TRAVEL.</i>

259
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,328
<i>I CAN'T FORGET THE PICTURE</i>
<i>OF YEOMAN THOMPSON</i>

260
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,206
<i>CRUSHED TO</i>
<i>A HANDFUL OF DUST.</i>

261
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,585
SPOCK, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

262
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,044
YES, QUITE
ALL RIGHT,
DOCTOR.

263
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,379
YOU DIDN'T
LOOK VERY WELL

264
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,757
WHEN YOU BROKE
THAT MIND TOUCH.

265
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,800
I DID NOT
BREAK IT, DOCTOR.

266
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,301
I WAS THROWN AWAY

267
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,969
BY SOMETHING I'VE NEVER
EXPERIENCED BEFORE.

268
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,138
WHAT WAS IT?

269
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:38,187
A SERIES OF BIZARRE
AND EXOTIC IMAGES

270
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,857
BURSTING ON MY MIND
AND CONSCIOUSNESS.

271
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,859
COLORS...

272
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,360
SHAPES...

273
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,530
MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS
FUSED AND BLURRED.

274
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,616
I'VE BEEN ATTEMPTING
TO ISOLATE THEM,

275
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,368
BUT SO FAR I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO RECALL CLEARLY

276
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,828
ONLY ONE.

277
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,789
IMMENSE BEINGS...

278
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,084
100 LIMBS WHICH
RESEMBLE TENTACLES,

279
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,169
MINDS OF SUCH CONTROL
AND CAPACITY

280
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,589
THAT EACH LIMB
IS CAPABLE OF PERFORMING

281
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,382
A DIFFERENT FUNCTION.

282
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,304
DO YOU MEAN THAT'S WHAT
THE KELVANS REALLY ARE?

283
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,472
UNDOUBTEDLY.

284
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,599
WELL, IF THEY
LOOK THAT WAY
NORMALLY,

285
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,226
WHY DID THEY
ADAPT THEMSELVES
TO OUR BODIES?

286
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,352
PERHAPS PRACTICALITY.

287
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,438
THEY CHOSE
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

288
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,399
AS THE BEST VESSEL
FOR THE TRIP.

289
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,653
IMMENSE BEINGS
WITH 100 TENTACLES

290
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,988
WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY
WITH THE TURBO LIFT.

291
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,073
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THEM.

292
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,659
WE OUTNUMBER THEM.

293
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,369
THEIR ONLY HOLD ON US
IS THE PARALYSIS FIELD.

294
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,413
THAT'S ENOUGH.
ONE WRONG MOVE,

295
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,916
AND THEY JAM
ALL OUR NEURO CIRCUITS.

296
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,959
JAM.

297
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:41,918
SPOCK,

298
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,419
IF YOU REVERSE
THE CIRCUITS

299
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,921
ON McCOY'S
NEURO-ANALYZER,

300
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,548
CAN YOU SET UP
A COUNTER FIELD

301
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,425
TO JAM THE
PARALYSIS PROJECTOR?

302
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,551
I'M DUBIOUS OF
THE POSSIBILITIES OF
SUCCESS, CAPTAIN.

303
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,929
THE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT
IS NOT DESIGNED

304
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,555
TO PUT OUT A GREAT DEAL
OF POWER.

305
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,933
THE POLARIZED ELEMENTS
WOULD BURN OUT QUICKLY.

306
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,434
IS THERE A CHANCE
AT ALL?

307
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,853
A SMALL ONE.

308
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,646
WE'LL TAKE IT.

309
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,023
YOU AND BONES
HAVE TO GET TO THE SHIP.

310
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,024
HOW?

311
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,233
YES, HO--

312
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,156
MR. SPOCK...

313
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,951
YOU'RE SICK.

314
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,954
I ASSURE YOU, CAPTAIN,
I'M IN PERFECT HEALTH.

315
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,622
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

316
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,041
DR. McCOY'S GIVEN YOU
A THROROUGH EXAMINATION,
AND YOU'RE ILL.

317
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,169
IN FACT, IF YOU DON'T
GET TO THE SICK BAY,
YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

318
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,380
IT'S A GOOD IDEA, JIM,
BUT ANYONE LOOKING AT HIM

319
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,923
CAN TELL HE'S HEALTHY.

320
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,927
VULCANS HAVE THE ABILITY
TO PLACE THEMSELVES
IN A KIND OF TRANCE,

321
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,597
COMPLETE RELAXATION
OF EVERY PART OF
THE MIND AND BODY.

322
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,975
WE FIND IT MORE
RESTFUL TO THE BODY

323
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,059
THAN YOUR
SO-CALLED VACATION.

324
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,186
CAN YOU DO IT NOW

325
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,105
AND COME OUT OF IT
IN THE SICK BAY,
SAY, IN A HALF AN HOUR?

326
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,400
IT WILL TAKE ME
A MOMENT TO PREPARE.

327
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,568
GO AHEAD.

328
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,129
JIM...

329
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,131
HIS HEARTBEAT
REALLY IS SLOW.

330
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,510
HIS PULSE IS
PRACTICALLY NONEXISTENT.

331
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,971
HANAR.

332
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,514
HANAR.

333
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,102
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
HUMAN?

334
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,396
MR. SPOCK IS ILL.

335
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,648
THE DOCTOR THINKS
HE MAY BE DYING.

336
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,862
THIS ILLNESS CAME ON HIM
RATHER SUDDENLY.

337
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,154
IS IT NOT UNUSUAL?

338
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,033
HE'S A VULCAN.
THEY DON'T REACT
LIKE HUMANS.

339
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,285
HE MAY DIE!
IF I CAN GET HIM
UP TO SICK BAY,

340
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,203
THERE'S A CHANCE
HE'LL LIVE.

341
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,791
STAND AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

342
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,844
I WILL HAVE YOU
BEAMED ABOARD.

343
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,931
DO WHAT YOU CAN
WITH HIM, BONES.

344
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,648
DOCTOR, WHAT HAPPENED?

345
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,817
PREPARE 2 CCs
OF STOKALINE.

346
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,110
STOKALINE?
BUT, DOCTOR, THAT--

347
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,570
DON'T ARGUE, NURSE.
JUST GET IT.

348
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,875
THIS MAY BE
THE TURNING POINT.
PREPARE ANOTHER SHOT.

349
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,376
BUT, DOC--

350
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,336
PLEASE, NURSE.

351
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,629
JUST FOLLOW ORDERS,
WILL YOU?

352
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,560
THERE, THAT
SHOULD DO IT.

353
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,813
JUST LET HIM
REST NOW.

354
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,732
YOU SEE,

355
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:55,653
IT'S A FLARE-UP
OF RIGELIAN KASSABA FEVER.

356
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,031
HE SUFFERED FROM IT
ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO,

357
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,533
AND IT RECURS
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

358
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,410
THERE'S NO DANGER
IF HE GETS MEDICATION
IN TIME.

359
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,163
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

360
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,539
VERY WELL.

361
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,583
I WILL INFORM ROJAN.
YOU WILL STAY HERE.

362
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,550
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH ME NOW?

363
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,301
WE WILL BEAM ABOARD
THE VESSEL SHORTLY.

364
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,095
I WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND
YOUR DUTIES.

365
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,972
MY DUTY IS TO STOP YOU
IN ANY WAY I CAN.

366
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,390
YOU WILL OBEY.

367
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,893
OR YOU'LL KILL
MORE OF MY PEOPLE.

368
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,896
CAPTAIN KIRK,

369
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,023
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND

370
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,733
THE IMPORTANCE
OF MY MISSION.

371
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,152
WE KELVANS HAVE
A CODE OF HONOR.

372
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,238
HARSH, DEMANDING.

373
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,490
IT CALLS FOR MUCH
FROM US...

374
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,869
AND MUCH FROM THOSE
WHOM WE CONQUER.

375
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,163
YOU HAVE BEEN CONQUERED.

376
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,000
I RESPECT YOUR DEVOTION
TO YOUR DUTY,

377
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,586
BUT I CANNOT PERMIT IT
TO INTERFERE WITH MINE.

378
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,214
THESE ARE LOVELY.

379
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,215
CAPTAIN KIRK,

380
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,967
WHAT IS IT YOU CALL THEM?

381
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,511
FLOWERS.

382
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,804
I DON'T KNOW
THE VARIETY.

383
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,849
OUR MEMORY TAPES
TELL US OF SUCH THINGS

384
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,308
ON KELVAN.

385
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,145
CRYSTALS THAT FORM
WITH SUCH RAPIDITY,

386
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,397
THEY SEEM TO GROW.

387
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,192
THEY LOOK LIKE
THIS FRAGILE THING SOMEWHAT.

388
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,195
WE CALL THEM SAHSHEER.

389
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,239
A ROSE BY
ANY OTHER NAME.

390
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,448
CAPTAIN?

391
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:27,286
A QUOTE FROM
A GREAT HUMAN POET...

392
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,329
SHAKESPEARE.

393
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,750
"THAT WHICH WE
CALL A ROSE
BY ANY OTHER NAME...

394
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,545
WOULD SMELL AS SWEET."

395
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,100
DREA HAS COMPUTED
AND LAID A COURSE
FOR KELVA, CAPTAIN.

396
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,644
WE'VE JUMPED TO WARP 8.

397
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,353
WE'LL GO FASTER YET.

398
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,564
INCREASE SPEED
TO WARP 11.

399
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,611
INCREASE SPEED
TO WARP 11, MR. CHEKOV.

400
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,242
ON COURSE AND PROCEEDING
AS PLANNED.

401
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,953
WE WILL APPROACH
THE BARRIER
WITHIN AN HOUR.

402
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,122
VERY WELL.

403
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,173
ROJAN,
I'M GOING TO SICK BAY.

404
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,924
MY FIRST OFFICER'S
TAKEN ILL.

405
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:22,967
YES, I WAS INFORMED.

406
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,136
YOU MAY GO.

407
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,017
ANYTHING?

408
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,310
I'VE LOCATED
THEIR POWER SOURCE, CAPTAIN.

409
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,187
IT'S INSTALLED
IN ENGINEERING.

410
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,855
WE'RE JUST GOING
TO JAM IT.

411
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,439
I'VE TIED IN ALL
THE LAB COMPUTERS.

412
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,859
THAT'LL GIVE US A BIT
MORE POWER TO PUSH WITH.

413
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,248
THIS IS IT.

414
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,833
ALL WE HAVE TO DO--

415
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,710
WHATEVER WE MUST DO,
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

416
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,586
WHY?

417
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,629
THIS MATERIAL
SURROUNDING
THE PROJECTOR

418
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,300
IS THE SAME
AS I DISCOVERED
ON THE PLANET.

419
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,302
READINGS INDICATE
IT IS IMPERVIOUS
TO ANY OF OUR WEAPONS.

420
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,386
WE CANNOT
PENETRATE THE CASING

421
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,723
TO GET TO
THE MACHINE.

422
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,390
THAT'S IT, THEN.

423
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,895
THERE IS ONE OTHER
POSSIBILITY, MR. SCOTT.

424
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,939
THE FINAL DECISION,
OF COURSE,
MUST BE THE CAPTAIN'S,

425
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,150
BUT I BELIEVE
WE MUST HAVE IT
READY FOR HIM.

426
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,400
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
IS PROPELLED

427
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,071
BY MATTER-ANTI-MATTER
REACTORS.

428
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,781
THE BARRIER
WE MUST TRAVERSE

429
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,326
IS NEGATIVE ENERGY.

430
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,661
I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING AT.

431
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,747
I CAN'T SAY I LIKE IT.

432
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,749
NOR I.

433
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,543
BUT IT MUST BE
MADE AVAILABLE
TO THE CAPTAIN.

434
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,636
<i>CAPTAIN KIRK</i>
<i>TO THE BRIDGE, PLEASE.</i>

435
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,105
WELL?

436
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,689
IMPOSSIBLE, CAPTAIN.

437
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,067
THE POWER SOURCE
IS PROTECTED BY A MATERIAL

438
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,652
WE CANNOT BREACH
EVEN WITH OUR PHASERS.

439
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,243
MR. SCOTT AND I
HAVE PREPARED THE MEANS

440
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,661
FOR THE ONLY LOGICAL
ALTERNATIVE TO US.

441
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,039
WHAT ALTERNATIVE?

442
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,665
THE BARRIER
WE MUST PENETRATE

443
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,042
IS COMPOSED
OF NEGATIVE ENERGY.

444
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,628
I HAVE OPENED
THE CONTROL VALVES

445
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:25,089
TO THE
MATTER-ANTI-MATTER
NACELLES.

446
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,715
ON YOUR SIGNAL,

447
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,925
I'LL FLOOD THEM
WITH POSITIVE ENERGY.

448
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,884
WHAT?

449
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,261
WHEN WE
ENGAGE THE BARRIER,

450
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,345
THE SHIP WILL EXPLODE.

451
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,973
THE KELVANS WILL
BE STOPPED HERE.

452
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:34,932
AND SO WILL WE.

453
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,767
ARE YOU MAD?

454
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,852
I CAN'T JUST--

455
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,479
TAKE YOUR PLACES,
GENTLEMEN.

456
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,316
WE'RE APPROACHING
THE BARRIER.

457
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,025
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 4658.9.</i>

458
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,819

<i>UNDER CONTROL OF THE KELVANS,</i>

459
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,446

463
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,163
<i>THEY HAVE RIGGED THE SHIP</i>

465
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,876
READING, SPOCK.

466
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,003
SENSORS INDICATE
DENSITY NEGATIVE,

467
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:46,962
RADIATION NEGATIVE,

468
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,215
ENERGY NEGATIVE.

469
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,519
ALL INSTRUMENTS
OFF THE DIAL, CAPTAIN.

470
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,397
WE ARE IN CONTACT
WITH THE BARRIER.

471
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,234
OUTSIDE HULL TEMPERATURES
RISING, SIR.

472
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,195
OVER 2,000 DEGREES NOW.

473
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,615
SIR!

474
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,829
HOLD YOUR POSITION.

475
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,411
WE...

476
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,995
MADE IT.

477
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,792

TO NORMAL, CAPTAIN.

478
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,837

00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,465

00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,592
NONE AFFECT

483
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,598
I'LL HAVE A FULL REPORT
ON SHIP'S STATUS FOR YOU
IN A MOMENT, SIR.

484
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,933
YOUR PEOPLE ARE
MOST EFFICIENT, CAPTAIN.

485
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,977
THANK YOU.

486
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,187
SO ARE YOURS.

487
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,522
HANAR,

488
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:31,317
START THE
NEUTRALIZING
OPERATION.

489
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,448
WHAT NEUTRALIZING
OPERATION?

490
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,866
YOU HUMANS ARE
TROUBLESOME FOR US.

491
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,077
WE NEEDED YOU

492
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,954
TO GET US THROUGH
THE BARRIER.

493
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,747
BUT THERE AREN'T
ENOUGH OF US

494
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,208
TO EFFICIENTLY
GUARD ALL OF YOU
ALL OF THE TIME.

495
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,793
FURTHER, THE FOOD
SYNTHESIZERS

496
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,088
CANNOT MANUFACTURE
ENOUGH FOOD FOR
THE ENTIRE JOURNEY.

497
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,174
WE ARE THEREFORE
NEUTRALIZING

498
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,592
ALL NONESSENTIAL
PERSONNEL.

499
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,135
NO.

500
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,554
THE PROCEDURE
IS ALREADY UNDERWAY.

501
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,642
NOW, AS TO
BRIDGE PERSONNEL...

502
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,061
DREA.

503
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,822
WE HAVE NO NEED
FOR COMMUNICATION.

504
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,334
AND SINCE DREA
IS CAPABLE

505
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,711
OF HANDLING THE SHIP
FROM HERE ON...

506
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,308
DO YOU NOT AGREE THAT
THIS IS A BETTER THING
FOR THEM

507
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,393
THAN EXPLODING
THE SHIP

508
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,812
AS YOUR ENGINEER
HAD THOUGHT TO DO?

509
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,774
WE DETECTED IT,
OF COURSE.

510
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,527
TOMAR HAS
DEVISED A MECHANISM

511
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,613
TO PREVENT ANY
FURTHER TAMPERING.

512
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,239
PLEASE ACCEPT
YOUR SITUATION,
CAPTAIN.

513
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,575
IT WILL MAKE THINGS
MUCH LESS PAINFUL.

514
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,633
IS THIS ALL?

515
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:04,261
I HAVE REVIEWED
SHIP'S PERSONNEL,
CAPTAIN.

516
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,804
IT APPEARS WE FOUR

517
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,391
ARE THE ONLY ONES
THE KELVANS CONSIDER
ESSENTIAL.

518
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,935
SCOTTY TELLS ME
YOU COULD'VE
DESTROYED THE SHIP

519
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,978
IN THE BARRIER.

520
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,563
WHY DIDN'T YOU?
I COULDN'T.

521
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,230
IF THAT WAS OUR ONLY
CHANCE TO STOP--

522
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,441
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS.

523
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,109
JIM--
BONES, THAT'S ENOUGH!

524
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,861
JIM, I SAW THEM REDUCE
FOUR OF MY DOCTORS AND NURSES--

525
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,614
THEY REDUCED
THE WHOLE CREW!

526
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,081
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE

527
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,126
TO CONSUME
THIS BULK MATERIAL

528
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,295
TO SUSTAIN YOURSELVES.

529
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,380
WE HAVE ASCERTAINED
THAT THESE CONTAIN

530
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,633
ALL THE NUTRITIONAL
ELEMENTS.

531
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,926
BEFORE YOU CONDEMN IT,
WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT?

532
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,345
I BELIEVE I WILL.

533
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,554
ASSIST ME.

534
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,475
IT'S YOUR IDEA, DOCTOR.
GO AHEAD.

535
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,853
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW
TO WORK THE SELECTOR.

536
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,425
SIR, WHY DON'T WE
TRY AGAIN

537
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,927
TO KNOCK OUT THE
PARALYSIS PROJECTOR?

538
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,388
I KNOW THE CASING
LOOKS IMPENETRABLE,

539
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,265
BUT I MAY BE ABLE
TO DO SOMETHING.

540
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,892
EVEN IF WE COULD,
IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.

541
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,062
WE NEED THAT PROJECTOR
TO BRING OUR PEOPLE
BACK TO HUMAN FORM.

542
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,689
THEN HOW WILL WE
STOP THE KELVANS?

543
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,399
Spock: CAPTAIN.

544
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,903
IT'S QUITE GOOD.

545
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,406
I'M DELIGHTED.

546
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,249
MOST CURIOUS.

547
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,500
WHAT IS?

548
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,503
THE ISOLATED GLIMPSES
OF THINGS I SAW

549
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,296
WHEN I TOUCHED
KELINDA'S MIND

550
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,924
ARE BEGINNING TO COALESCE
IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS.

551
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,302
THE KELVANS HAVE SUPERIOR
INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY.

552
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,387
TO ACHIEVE IT,

553
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,305
THEY HAVE APPARENTLY
SACRIFICED

554
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,016
ANYTHING WHICH WOULD
TEND TO DISTRACT THEM.

555
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,769
PERCEPTIVE SENSES

556
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:18,228
SUCH AS TASTE,
TOUCH, SMELL,

557
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,939
AND, OF COURSE, EMOTIONS.

558
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,358
BUT THEN TOMAR

559
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,861
SHOULDN'T BE ENJOYING
THE TASTE OF HIS FOOD.

560
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:26,862
YES.

561
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,447
QUITE CORRECT, CAPTAIN.

562
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,532
BUT THEY HAVE TAKEN
HUMAN FORM

563
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:35,328
AND ARE THEREFORE
HAVING HUMAN REACTION.

564
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,252
HMM.

565
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,212
IF HE KEEPS REACTING
LIKE THAT,

566
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,672
HE'S GONNA NEED A DIET.

567
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:49,050
IF THEY ALL RESPOND
TO STIMULATION OF THE SENSES,

568
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,428
THEN MAYBE WE CAN
DISTRACT THEM.

569
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,556
THEY CAN'T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO HANDLE
THE SENSES YET.

570
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,600
IF WE CAN CONFUSE
THEM ENOUGH,

571
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,019
WE CAN GET THOSE DEVICES
FROM THEIR BELTS.

572
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,730
THAT SEEMS REASONABLE.

573
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:02,648
ALL RIGHT.

574
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:05,358
IT MAY BE
OUR ONLY CHANCE.

575
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,277
LOOK FOR ANY WAY

576
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,237
TO STIMULATE
THE SENSES.

577
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,573
I CAN THINK OF ONE WAY
RIGHT OFF.

578
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,871
LAD, YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED SOMETHING

579
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,706
TO WASH THAT
DOWN WITH.

580
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:22,960
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED
ANY SAURIAN BRANDY?

581
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,050
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

582
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,178
PLEASE ARTICULATE.

583
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,806
THAT BODY OF YOURS
IS A BIT ANEMIC.

584
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,265
COMES FROM TAKING
FOOD IN PILLS

585
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,101
INSTEAD OF
SOLID SUSTENANCE.

586
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,020
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

587
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,396
GOING TO GIVE YOU
A SHOT.

588
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,608
HIGH POTENCY
VITAMIN CONCENTRATE.

589
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,987
YOU'LL NEED
THREE A DAY
FOR A FEW DAYS.

590
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:56,159
AND EAT SOME
SOLID FOOD, WILL YA?

591
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,842
NO MORE.

592
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,557
AM I DISTURBING YOU?

593
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,768
WHAT IS IT YOU WISH?

594
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,020
I...

595
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,022
WISH TO APOLOGIZE.

596
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,399
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
CAPTAIN.

597
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,484
FOR HITTING YOU.
I'M SORRY.

598
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,569
THAT IS NOT NECESSARY.

599
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:34,113
YOU ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE
AS WE WOULD HAVE.

600
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,615
YES, WELL, I...

601
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,075
DON'T USUALLY
GO AROUND

602
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,703
BEATING UP
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

603
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:40,954
WHY NOT?

604
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,581
WELL, THERE ARE
BETTER THINGS

605
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:43,916
FOR MEN AND WOMEN
TO DO.

606
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,752
LIKE WHAT?

607
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,092
IS THIS
WHERE I HIT YOU?

608
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,094
NO, THE OTHER SIDE.

609
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,012
OH.

610
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,805
I'M SORRY.

611
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:01,808
IS THAT BETTER?

612
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,268
BETTER?

613
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,771
WAS IT INTENDED
AS A REMEDY?

614
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,817
THIS IS.

615
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,578
IS THERE SOME
SIGNIFICANCE
TO THIS ACTION?

616
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,959
WELL, AMONG HUMANS,
IT'S, UH...

617
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,961
MEANT TO EXPRESS...

618
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,545
WARMTH AND LOVE.

619
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,547
OH.

620
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,758
YOU ARE TRYING
TO SEDUCE ME.

621
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,095
I HAVE BEEN
STUDYING YOU.

622
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,305
ME?

623
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,264
ALL HUMANS.

624
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,224
THIS BUSINESS
OF LOVE...

625
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,227
YOU HAVE DEVOTED
MUCH LITERATURE TO IT.

626
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,188
WHY DO YOU BUILD
SUCH A MYSTIQUE

627
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,357
AROUND A SIMPLE
BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION?

628
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,569
WE ENJOY IT.

629
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,238
THE LITERATURE?

630
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,325
KELINDA, I'M SORRY
I BROUGHT UP
THE WHOLE SUBJECT.

631
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,994
DO YOU
REALLY REGARD

632
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:02,953
THIS TOUCHING
OF THE LIPS
AS PLEASURABLE?

633
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,370
I DID.

634
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,790
CURIOUS.

635
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,792
LET ME TRY.

636
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,263
IS THERE
SOME PROBLEM, CAPTAIN?

637
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,556
NOT WHEN I CAME IN.

638
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:27,519
WHAT DID HE
WANT HERE?

639
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,105
HE CAME TO APOLOGIZE
FOR HITTING ME.

640
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,316
APPARENTLY IT INVOLVES
SOME PECULIAR
TOUCHING CONTACT.

641
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,651
IN WHAT MANNER?

642
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,578
VERY ODD CREATURES,
THESE HUMANS.

643
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,760
DO YOU HAVE MORE?

644
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,764
NOT OF THIS.

645
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,683
WELL, ANYTHING.

646
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,734
YES. HUMANS ARE
VERY PECULIAR.

647
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,778
I OFTEN FIND THEM
UNFATHOMABLE.

648
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,614
BUT AN INTERESTING
PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY.

649
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,617
WELL, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THIS BUSINESS

650
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:28,580
OF PRESSING WITH
THE LIPS TO APOLOGIZE.

651
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:32,375
I BELIEVE YOU'RE
REFERRING TO A KISS.

652
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,377
BUT IT IS
MY UNDERSTANDING

653
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,338
THAT SUCH APOLOGIES
ARE USUALLY EXCHANGED

654
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,716
BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE
SOME AFFECTION

655
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:40,884
FOR EACH OTHER.

656
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,929
KELINDA HAS NO AFFECTION
FOR CAPTAIN KIRK.

657
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,641
YOUR GAME IS OFF.

658
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,311
ARE YOU DISTURBED
BY THE INCIDENT?

659
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,565
WHY SHOULD I
BE DISTURBED?

660
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,567
YOU'VE KNOWN KELINDA
FOR SOME TIME.

661
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,402
SHE'S A KELVAN
AS YOU ARE.

662
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,865
AMONG HUMANS,
I'VE FOUND THE SYMPTOMS
YOU'RE DISPLAYING

663
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,575
USUALLY
INDICATE JEALOUSY.

664
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,954
I HAVE NO REASON
FOR SUCH A REACTION.

665
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,748
KELINDA'S A FEMALE,
NOTHING MORE.

666
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,961
CAPTAIN KIRK
SEEMS TO FIND HER
QUITE ATTRACTIVE.

667
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:17,170
WELL, OF COURSE SHE IS!

668
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,505
YOU ARE NOT JEALOUS.
NO!

669
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,716
NOR UPSET.
CERTAINLY NOT.

670
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,514
CHECKMATE.

671
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,815
I FOUND THIS ON
GANYMOOD...

672
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,566
UH, GANYMEDE.

673
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,110
WHAT IS IT?

674
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,528
WELL, IT'S, UM...

675
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,825
IT'S GREEN.

676
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,419
KELINDA, I'VE
BEEN THINKING.

677
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,629
YES?

678
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,090
I DO NOT WISH YOU
TO FRATERNIZE

679
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:02,340
WITH ANY
OF THE HUMANS.

680
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,509
WHY NOT?

681
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,552
WELL, THEY...

682
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,471
THEY OFFER SUCH
STRANGE IDEAS.

683
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,348
THEY'RE NOT
MEANT FOR US.

684
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,891
NOT FOR KELVANS.

685
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,852
HAVE YOU GIVEN
THIS ORDER
TO THE OTHERS?

686
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:17,522
NO. I WISH YOU
TO PARTICULARLY
AVOID CAPTAIN KIRK.

687
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:18,481
I WILL NOT!

688
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,233
YOU HAVE TOLD ME
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

689
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,277
HUMANS ARE
NO THREAT TO US.

690
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,529
WE ARE SUPERIOR.

691
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,865
I WILL DO
AS I PLEASE.

692
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,575
YOU WILL DO AS I SAY,

693
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,578
OR I WILL NEUTRALIZE
YOUR CAPTAIN KIRK

694
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,332
AND ALL THE OTHER HUMANS
AS WELL.

695
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:53,183
HOW MANY MORE OF THESE?

696
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,560
WELL, NOW, LET'S SEE.

697
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,603
YOU'VE HAD
THREE SHOTS...

698
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,314
YOU BETTER STAY
ON THEM FOR A FEW DAYS,

699
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,565
AND THEN WE'LL SEE
HOW YOU'RE RESPONDING.

700
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,735
I SEE NO REASON FOR YOU
TO REFER TO YOURSELF

701
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,820
IN THE PLURAL.

702
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,537
YOU HAVE MORE?

703
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,081
ALL I HAVE

704
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:21,419
IS A BOTTLE OF
VERY, VERY, VERY
OLD SCOTCH.

705
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,339
WHISKEY!

706
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,673
WELL,
I WILL TRY IT.

707
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,966
I'LL GET IT!

708
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,927
[GLASS BREAKS]

709
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,852
I WAS
SAVING YOU FOR--

710
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,354
WHAT?

711
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,606
NEVER MIND.

712
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,942
HERE'S YOUR GLASS.

713
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:50,823
I CAN'T TELL
IF WE'RE GETTING ANYWHERE.

714
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,201
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN SCOTTY
IN HOURS.

715
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,869
WE HAVEN'T SEEN
TOMAR EITHER.

716
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,747
BUT MY MAN HANAR IS
GETTING MORE IRRITABLE
BY THE MINUTE.

717
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,832
I'M GIVING HIM
SHOTS OF FORMAZINE.

718
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,294
THAT SHOULD HAVE HIM
CLIMBING THE WALLS.

719
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:04,587
ROJAN HAS EXHIBITED
SYMPTOMS OF JEALOUSY.

720
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,259
I WOULD LIKE TO
SPEAK WITH YOU,
CAPTAIN.

721
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,553
DOCTOR,

722
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,473
I'M DUE FOR
ANOTHER INJECTION
OF STOKALINE.

723
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,393
HMM?

724
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,394
STOKALINE.

725
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,645
OH.

726
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,483
YOU WILL PARDON US.

727
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,614
YOU HAD SOMETHING
TO SAY?

728
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,573
YES.

729
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,493
THIS CULTURAL MYSTIQUE

730
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,287
SURROUNDING THE
BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION.

731
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,496
YES.

732
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,540
YOU REALIZE HUMANS
ARE OVERLY PREOCCUPIED

733
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,126
WITH THE SUBJECT.

734
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,504
YES. WE DO THINK
A GREAT DEAL ABOUT IT.

735
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:51,343
I'VE DONE SOME
SUPPLEMENTAL READING
ON IT,

736
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,303
AND, UH...

737
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,804
YOU HAVE A QUESTION?

738
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,056
YES.

739
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,641
I WAS WONDERING,

740
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:02,270
WOULD YOU PLEASE
APOLOGIZE TO ME AGAIN?

741
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,486
ROJAN, I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

742
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,611
VERY WELL.

743
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,863
FIRST, I DO NOT
LIKE THE WAY

744
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,698
RESPONSIBILITY
AND DUTY HAS BEEN
PORTIONED OUT TO US.

745
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,741
IT'S THE WAY YOUR DUTIES
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ASSIGNED.

746
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,785
THAT IS MY
SECOND QUARREL
WITH YOU.
HANAR!

747
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,120
FURTHER,
I DO NOT CARE MUCH
FOR THE WAY

748
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,038
YOU RUN THIS SHIP.

749
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,539
HANAR, CONFINE YOURSELF
TO YOUR QUARTERS!

750
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:38,056
OHHH, ROJAN HAS
FORBIDDEN ME TO SEE YOU.

751
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:41,393
YES, THAT'S TOO BAD.

752
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,269
WHY DO YOU DEFY HIM?

753
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:44,979
IT'S NOT A QUESTION
OF DEFIANCE.

754
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,358
WE WERE TOLD TO
FIND OUT EVERYTHING
WE COULD ABOUT YOU.

755
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,318
WELL, HOW'S
THE RESEARCH GOING?

756
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:53,946
I NEED SOME MORE
EXPERIMENTS.

757
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,914
MR. SPOCK, YOU WERE NOT
ORDERED TO THE BRIDGE.

758
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,040
WHAT IS
YOUR PURPOSE HERE?

759
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,542
AUTOMATIC SENSORS

760
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,585
AND VARIOUS OTHER
RECORDING DEVICES

761
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,046
REQUIRE MONITORING
AND PERIODIC ADJUSTMENTS.

762
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,298
VERY WELL. PROCEED.

763
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,727
HAVE YOU SEEN
CAPTAIN KIRK?

764
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,396
IF YOU WISH,
I SHALL CALL HIM
TO THE BRIDGE.

765
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,981
NO.
I WAS WONDERING
WHERE HE WAS.

766
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,026
I LEFT HIM IN
THE RECREATION ROOM.

767
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,611
HE WAS ALONE THEN.

768
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,613
NO, KELINDA
WAS WITH HIM.

769
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,242
SHE SEEMED ANXIOUS
TO SPEAK TO HIM.

770
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,827
I TOLD HER
TO STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

771
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,830
IT WOULD APPEAR, SIR,
THAT YOU HAVE LITTLE
CONTROL OVER HER.

772
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,832
OR PERHAPS...

773
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,919
CAPTAIN KIRK HAS MORE.

774
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,606
VERY INTERESTING.

775
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,693
BUT I FEEL RATHER...

776
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,488
STRANGE.

777
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,289
WE DID IT,

778
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,374
YOU AND ME.

779
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,586
PUT HIM RIGHT
UNDER THE TABLE.

780
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,603
I'LL TAKE THIS
TO THE CAPTAIN.

781
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,042
KELINDA, I TOLD YOU
TO AVOID THIS HUMAN.

782
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,211
I DID NOT WISH TO.

783
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,879
I AM YOUR COMMANDER.

784
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:18,257
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH,
ROJAN.

785
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,259
YOU DID THIS TO HER,
CORRUPTED HER,

786
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,678
TURNED HER
AWAY FROM ME!

787
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,264
IF YOU CAN'T KEEP HER,
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

788
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,516
YOU WILL
RELEASE HER!

789
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,540
WHY DON'T YOU USE
YOUR PARALYZER?

790
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,599
YOU THOUGHT I WAS TAKING
YOUR WOMAN AWAY FROM YOU.

791
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:08,933
YOU'RE JEALOUS!

792
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:11,894
YOU TRIED TO KILL ME
WITH YOUR BARE HANDS.

793
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:12,769
WOULD A KELVAN DO THAT?
WOULD HE HAVE TO?

794
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,523
YOU'RE REACTING
WITH THE EMOTIONS
OF A HUMAN.

795
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:17,275
YOU<i> ARE</i> A HUMAN.

796
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,569
NO, I CANNOT BE!

797
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,487
I'M STIMULATING HIM.

798
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:32,915
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

799
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,130
TO USE THIS SHIP,

800
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,048
YOU HAVE TO USE
OUR FORM.

801
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:41,882
NOW YOU'RE
STUCK WITH IT,

802
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:42,300
YOU AND
YOUR DESCENDANTS

803
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:43,842
FOR THE NEXT
300 YEARS.

804
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,052
YOU FOOL!
THESE BODIES ARE TOOLS.

805
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:48,222
WE REMAIN KELVANS!

806
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,599
LOOK WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO YOU

807
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:50,767
IN THE SHORT TIME
YOU'VE BEEN
EXPOSED TO US.

808
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,728
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WILL HAPPEN
IN THREE CENTURIES?

809
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,730
WHEN THIS SHIP
GETS TO KELVA...

810
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,856
THE PEOPLE ON IT
WILL BE HUMAN.

811
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,858
THEY'LL BE ALIENS,
ENEMIES!

812
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,902
WE HAVE A DUTY...

813
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:02,654
OUR MISSION...

814
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:05,490
WE'VE GOT TO ACCOMPLISH
ANY WAY WE CAN.

815
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,700
YOUR MISSION IS
TO FIND NEW WORLDS

816
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:08,867
FOR YOUR PEOPLE
TO LIVE IN.

817
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,244
YOU CAN STILL
DO THAT.

818
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,455
WE CAN BRING
THIS PROBLEM
TO THE FEDERATION.

819
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,500
THERE ARE
MANY PLANETS
IN THIS GALAXY

820
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,460
THAT CAN
BE INHABITED.

821
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,422
YOU WOULD REALLY DO THAT?

822
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:25,551
YOU WOULD EXTEND WELCOME
TO INVADERS?

823
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:26,636
NO.

824
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,765
BUT WE WOULD
WELCOME FRIENDS.

825
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,602
ROJAN, YOU ARE ONLY
A LINK IN A CHAIN

826
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,355
FOLLOWING AN ORDER
GIVEN 300 YEARS AGO.

827
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,897
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY

828
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,900
FOR YOU TO ESTABLISH
A DESTINY OF YOUR OWN.

829
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,658
PERHAPS.

830
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,536
PERHAPS IT COULD BE DONE.

831
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,832
A ROBOT SHIP
COULD BE SENT TO KELVA

832
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,334
WITH THE FEDERATION
PROPOSAL.

833
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,212
BUT...

834
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,879
IF WE RETAIN THIS FORM,

835
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,800
WHERE COULD WE
FIND A PLACE?

836
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,010
IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT LITTLE PLANET
YOU WERE ON

837
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,554
WAS KIND OF NICE.

838
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,559
AND YOU...

839
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,771
YOU WOULD WISH
TO REMAIN WITH HIM?

840
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,190
HE'S MOST INTERESTING.

841
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,442
BUT I WISH TO GO WITH YOU.

842
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,944
I BELIEVE I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

843
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:36,581
MOST PLEASURABLE.

844
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,252
YES.

845
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,420
VERY CURIOUS.

846
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,296
YOU SEE, ROJAN,

847
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,298
BEING HUMAN DOES HAVE
CERTAIN ADVANTAGES.

848
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,343
BEING ABLE TO APPRECIATE
THE BEAUTY OF A FLOWER...

849
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,220
OR A WOMAN.

850
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:57,934
BRIDGE...

851
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,812
THIS IS ROJAN.

852
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:00,813
<i>YES, COMMANDER.</i>

853
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:04,525
I'M RETURNING
COMMAND OF THE SHIP
TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

854
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,860
YOU WILL FOLLOW
HIS ORDERS.

855
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,319
<i>SIR?</i>

856
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,782
TURN THE SHIP AROUND.

857
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,910
WE'RE GOING HOME.
