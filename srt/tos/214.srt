00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,362
I JUST COULD NOT
STAND TO WATCH,
SO I LEFT, I WENT HOME.

00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,705
SPOCK HERE, CAPTAIN.
MAY I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU?

343
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,834
YES.
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.

344
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,297
YES, MR. SPOCK?

345
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,301
CONCERNING THE SITUATION
YOU RELATED TO US--
IN MY OPINION,

346
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,888
THE ARGELIAN
EMPATHIC CONTACT IS AN
INTERESTING PHENOMENON,

347
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,725
BUT THE TECHNIQUE
IS NOT SOUND ENOUGH
TO RISK A MAN'S LIFE.

348
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,811
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST,
MR. SPOCK?

349
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,438
SIMPLY THAT WE BEAM
MR. SCOTT ONBOARD
THE "ENTERPRISE"

350
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,191
AND EMPLOY OUR COMPUTERS
TO LEARN THE TRUTH.

351
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,776
THESE ARE A PROUD PEOPLE.

352
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,778
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CUSTOMS,
THEIR OWN LAWS,

353
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,781
AND WHILE WE'RE HERE,
WE'RE SUBJECT TO THEM.

354
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:03,202
IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE
THIS MATTER BE RESOLVED

355
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,245
ACCORDING TO ARGELIAN LAW.
IS THAT CLEAR?

356
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,706
QUITE CLEAR, CAPTAIN.

357
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,666
I DON'T LIKE IT ANY MORE
THAN YOU DO, SPOCK,

358
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,878
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.
KIRK OUT.

359
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,508
Sybo:
LET US BEGIN.

360
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,511
LET THE CIRCLE
NOT BE BROKEN.

361
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,930
CONCENTRATE
UPON THE FLAME

362
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,017
WHICH BURNS
UPON THE ALTAR OF TRUTH.

363
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,021
YES...

364
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,982
THERE IS SOMETHING HERE...

365
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,903
SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

366
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,030
I FEEL ITS PRESENCE--

367
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:43,576
FEAR, ANGER, HATRED.

368
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,746
ANGER FEEDS THE FLAME.

369
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,039
OH...

370
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,957
OHH...

371
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,085
THERE IS EVIL HERE,

372
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,171
MONSTROUS,
TERRIBLE EVIL,

373
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,965
CONSUMING HUNGER,

374
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,801
HATRED OF ALL THAT LIVES,

375
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,762
HATRED OF WOMEN,

376
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,432
A HUNGER
THAT NEVER DIES.

377
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,434
IT IS STRONG,

378
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,519
OVERPOWERING,

379
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,730
AN ANCIENT TERROR.

380
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,565
IT HAS A NAME--

381
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,358
BERATIS, KESLA,

382
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,484
REDJAC!

383
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,528
DEVOURING ALL LIFE,
ALL LIGHT.

384
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,240
A HUNGER
THAT WILL NEVER DIE!

385
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,866
REDJAC!

386
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,826
REDJAC!

387
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,495
AAH!

388
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,521
THREE MURDERS...

389
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,275
AND SCOTTY THE ONLY
POSSIBLE ANSWER
EACH TIME.

390
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,611
I DON'T CARE WHAT
THE CIRCUMSTANCES
INDICATE, JIM.

391
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,196
SCOTTY SIMPLY COULD
NOT HAVE DONE IT.

392
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,698
NORMALLY, NO,
BUT THAT BLOW
ON HIS HEAD--

393
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,908
AH, NO, CAPTAIN.

394
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,493
SCOTTY, I'M SORRY.

395
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,163
YOU DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER WHETHER
YOU DID IT OR NOT.

396
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,789
I AGREE WITH YOU,
CAPTAIN.

397
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,874
I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED
MR. SCOTT IS GUILTY.

398
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,126
BUT NOT
RESPONSIBLE.

399
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,335
THAT IS UNPROVEN, SIR.

400
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,045
WE CAN PROVE IT
IF HE'S INSANE.

401
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,422
GENTLEMEN! PLEASE.

402
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:28,848
HOW COULD ANY MAN DO
SUCH MONSTROUS THINGS?

403
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,185
Kirk:
THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE
TO FIND OUT, SIR.

404
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:33,393
MR. SCOTT--

405
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,188
SIR, I SWEAR TO YOU
I DID NOT

406
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,065
KILL YOUR WIFE
OR THE OTHER LADIES.

407
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,526
BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER
YOU DID OR DIDN'T.

408
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,819
YOUR SO-CALLED
FAILING MEMORY--

409
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,361
MR. HENGIST.

410
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,613
ON THE "ENTERPRISE,"
WE CAN MAKE

411
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,157
A RECORDING
OF THE REGISTRATIONS

412
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,994
OF MR. SCOTT'S
CONSCIOUS AND
SUBCONSCIOUS MIND.

413
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,620
AND THEY WILL
TELL US

414
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,622
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
IN THE RECENT PAST.

415
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,624
McCoy: THERE WOULD BE
NO ROOM FOR DOUBT.

416
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,584
WE WOULD KNOW,
AND AFTER ALL, THAT'S

417
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,463
WHAT WE'RE AFTER,
ISN'T IT, PREFECT, TO KNOW?

418
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,299
Prefect:
YOU, SIR, CLAIM

419
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,343
TO REMEMBER NOTHING
ABOUT THE MURDERS.

420
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,469
AYE.

421
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,055
IF THIS IS SO,

422
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,640
YOU MAY HAVE KILLED
WITHOUT KNOWING IT.

423
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,103
WILL YOUR MACHINES
TELL US THIS?

424
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,190
NO DOUBT
WILL REMAIN.

425
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,151
VERY WELL.

426
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,279
WE WILL GO
TO YOUR SHIP...

427
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,532
AND HE WHO IS GUILTY

428
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,951
WILL FACE
THE ANCIENT PENALTIES,

429
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,914
BARBARIC AND HORRIBLE
THOUGH THEY MAY BE.

430
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,790
THE ANCIENT PENALTY
FOR MURDER

431
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,377
WAS DEATH BY SLOW TORTURE.

432
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,004
THAT LAW HAS
NEVER BEEN CHANGED.

433
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:45,132
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
MR. SCOTT?

434
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,052
AYE...

435
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,137
I UNDERSTAND.

436
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:02,482
"CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 3615.4.

437
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,819

DR. McCOY HAS ALREADY
FED THE COMPUTER
HIS MEDICAL REPORTS.

OUR LABORATORY EXPERTS
ARE EXAMINING THE MURDER WEAPON

448

AND WILL GIVE THEIR DATA TO
THE COMPUTERS FOR ANALYSIS.

449
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,055
SHALL WE BEGIN?

450
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,060
MR. SCOTT,
WILL YOU TAKE THE STAND?

HOW THAT CAN BE.

466
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:28,861
UNLESS SCOTTY'S
LYING ABOUT HIS LOSS
OF MEMORY.

467
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,946
I'M NOT LYING, CAPTAIN.

468
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,949

CAPTAIN...

473
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,837
I DIDN'T BLACK OUT WHEN
MR. JARIS' WIFE WAS KILLED.

474
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,717
ALL RIGHT, SCOTTY,

475
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,760
LET'S HAVE IT.

476
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,804
WE WERE HOLDING HANDS.

477
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,807
WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT,
THE CIRCLE WAS BROKEN.

478
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,726
I HEARD THE POOR LADY
SCREAM, AND I WAS--

479
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,395
I WAS NEAR THE HEAD
OF THE TABLE ANYWAY.

480
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,355
I WENT TOWARD HER, BUT...

481
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:08,025
THERE WAS...
SOMETHING IN MY WAY.

482
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,861
SOMETHING?
YOU MEAN, SOMEONE.

483
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,864
NO, CAPTAIN, SOME...

484
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,074
THING.

485
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,660
COLD, IT WAS,
LIKE A...

486
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,662
STINKING DRAFT OUT
OF A SLAUGHTERHOUSE,

487
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,706
BUT IT WASN'T R--

488
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,708
REALLY THERE.

489
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,669
LIKE A--

490
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,005
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

491
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,757

494
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,640
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S HIT IT
ON THE HEAD.

495
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,187
SCOTTY...

496
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,730
DID YOU KILL SYBO?

497
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,357
NO, CAPTAIN.

498
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,983
THAT I'M SURE OF.

499
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,944
HE'S BEEN SAYING THAT
RIGHT ALONG.

500
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,820
MEANS NO MORE NOW
THAN IT DID BEFORE.

501
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,864
SCOTTY, LIE TO ME.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

502
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,534
UH...22, SIR.

503
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,160
INACCURATE. INACCURATE.

504
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,455
DATA IN ERROR.

505
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,294
AFTER THE LIGHTS
WENT OUT, MR. SCOTT,

506
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,963
WHO WAS HOLDING YOUR HAND?

507
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,549
MORLA ON THE ONE SIDE
AND YOU ON THE OTHER, SIR.

508
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,593
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING, CAPTAIN.

509
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,553
WITH A ROOM THAT SMALL--
THE LIGHTS WERE OUT--

510
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,472
ANYONE WOULD'VE HAD TIME
TO KILL THE LADY.

511
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,931
Hengist:
BUT I REMIND YOU, WE FOUND

512
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,517
MR. SCOTT HOLDING HER IN
HIS ARMS, THE KNIFE ST--

513
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,894
I'M SORRY, SIR,
BUT I MUST.

514
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:29,064
THE KNIFE STILL IN HER BACK
AND BLOOD ON HIS HANDS.

515
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,649
THE VERIFIER SHOWED THAT
HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH

516
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,611
WHEN HE SAID
HE DIDN'T KILL HER.

517
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,946
THERE WERE TWO OTHER
WOMEN MURDERED.

518
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:41,201
MR. SCOTT...

519
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,871
DID YOU KILL KARA?

520
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,499
I DON'T REMEMBER.

521
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,083
DID YOU KILL
LIEUTENANT TRACY?

522
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,836
[SIGHS]
I DON'T REMEMBER.

523
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,421
COMPUTER, ACCURACY SCAN.

524
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,507
SUBJECT RELAYING
ACCURATE ACCOUNT.

525
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,967
NO PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES.

526
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,595
ALL THAT PROVES IS THAT
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH

527
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,180
WHEN HE SAYS
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER.

528
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,182
THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.

529
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,933
AFTER WE TAKE
THE TESTIMONY HERE,
WE'LL RUN

530
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,685
A PSYCHO-TRICORDER
ANALYSIS OF
MR. SCOTT'S MEMORY,

531
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,439
WHICH IS WHAT WE WANTED
TO DO ON THE SURFACE.

532
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,107
THAT WILL GIVE US
A COMPLETE RECORD.

533
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,651
WILL THAT SATISFY YOU,
MR. HENGIST?

534
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,278
WELL,
IF YOU CAN CONVINCE ME

535
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,364
THAT THE MACHINE
IS INCAPABLE OF ERROR

536
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,658
AND IF IT SHOWS
HE DID NOT KILL THE WOMEN.

537
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,284
THERE WILL BE NO ERROR.

538
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,827
AS FOR THE REST OF IT,

539
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,912
THE READINGS WILL SHOW.

540
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,208
I THINK YOU CAN
STEP DOWN NOW,
MR. SCOTT,

541
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,834
IF THERE ARE
NO OBJECTIONS.

542
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,419
I OBJECT TO THE
ENTIRE PROCEDURE.

543
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,880
MR. HENGIST,
WE ARE HERE ON
MY AUTHORITY.

544
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,798
WE WILL
COOPERATE.

545
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,510
PREFECT,
I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL,
BUT I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE--

546
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,470
FOR THE TIME BEING,
WE WILL ACCEPT

547
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,347
CAPTAIN KIRK'S
EXPLANATION

548
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,392
OF THE MACHINE'S
ACCURACY AS FACTUAL.

549
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,768
I DO, HOWEVER, RESERVE
TO MYSELF THE RIGHT

550
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,479
TO MAKE THE FINAL
DETERMINATION.

551
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,356
WE CAN ASK NO MORE.

552
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,150
MR. MORLA, WILL YOU
TAKE THE STAND?

553
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,165
WHERE WERE YOU AT THE TIME
THAT KARA WAS MURDERED?

554
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:13,711
I'M NOT SURE.
WALKING HOME, I--I ASSUME.

555
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,629
I WAS ANGRY.

556
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,424
ANGER IS
A RELATIVE STATE, SIR.

557
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,842
WERE YOU ANGRY ENOUGH
TO DO VIOLENCE?

558
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,678
I'VE NEVER DONE VIOLENCE
IN MY LIFE.

559
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,263
I DON'T THINK
THAT I COULD.

560
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,348
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME.
I WOULDN'T KILL HER.

561
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,601
I COULDN'T.

562
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,310
I LOVED HER,

563
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,062
AND SHE LOVED ME.

564
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,689
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

565
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,941
HE MIGHT THINK
SHE LOVED HIM,

566
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,984
BUT SHE DIDN'T.

567
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,278
SHE TOLD ME.

568
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,781
HE WAS JEALOUS

569
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,408
ALL THE TIME.

570
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,494
THEY FOUGHT CONSTANTLY.

571
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,288
DID YOU KILL
LIEUTENANT TRACY?

572
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,872
NO.

573
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:51,915
DID YOU KILL SYBO?

574
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,166
NO.

575
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,752

NO PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES.

579
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,971
ALL RIGHT, MR. MORLA,
I THINK YOU CAN
STEP DOWN NOW.

580
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,899
SYBO SPOKE OF A HUNGER
THAT NEVER DIED,

581
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,944
SOMETHING THAT THRIVES
ON...FEAR,

582
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,614
TERROR, DEATH.

583
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,283
MR. SPOCK, MAYBE
WE'RE GOING ABOUT IT
THE WRONG WAY.

584
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:31,121
LET'S ASSUME THAT SYBO
WAS A SENSITIVE--

585
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,166
THAT SHE DID
SENSE SOMETHING,
SOMETHING EVIL.

586
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,376
SENSITIVITY OF CERTAIN
ARGELIAN WOMEN

587
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,086
IS A DOCUMENTED FACT,
CAPTAIN.

588
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:41,131
MY POOR SYBO'S TALENT
WAS GENUINE, GENTLEMEN.

589
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,718
WHAT SHE TOLD YOU
WAS TRUE.

590
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,136
ALL RIGHT, THEN,

591
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,764
WHAT WAS IT
SHE SAID, EXACTLY?

592
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,266
MONSTROUS EVIL,
ANCIENT TERROR...

593
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,311
THAT DEVOURS
ALL LIFE AND LIGHT.

594
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,397
SHE SAID SOMETHING
ELSE--WORDS THAT
DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

595
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,065
YES.

596
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,651

00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,277

AND, UH...KESLA.

599
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,325
OBSCURE,
MEANINGLESS WORDS.

600
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,328

BUT TO THE COMPUTER?

601
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,955

JACK THE RIPPER?

622
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,261
WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
HE LIVED HUNDREDS
OF YEARS AGO.

623
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:13,139
A MAN COULDN'T SURVIVE
ALL THESE CENTURIES.

624
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,810
JUST BEFORE
SHE DIED,

625
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:20,814
MY WIFE SAID...

626
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:24,443
IT IS A HUNGER

627
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,738
THAT NEVER...DIES.

628
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,615
BUT ALL MEN DIE.

629
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,575
YES, ALL MEN DIE,

630
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,619
AND JACK THE RIPPER
COULDN'T BE ALIVE

631
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,537
IF HE WERE A MAN,

632
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,748
BUT EVERYTHING
WE'VE UNCOVERED POINTS

633
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,460
TO JACK THE RIPPER, WHICH IS
AN IMPOSSIBILITY, ISN'T IT?

634
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,754
OR IS IT?

635
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:47,173
HUMANS AND HUMANOIDS MAKE UP
ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE

636
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,134
OF THE LIFE FORMS
WE KNOW OF.

637
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,345
THERE ARE ENTITIES
POSSESSED OF EXTREMELY
LONG LIFE SPANS,

638
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,181
VIRTUALLY IMMORTAL.

639
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,184
WE KNOW THAT...

640
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,771
SOMEONE OR...

641
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:03,774
SOMETHING...KILLED
THREE WOMEN.

642
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,984
IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
FOR IT TO BE HUMAN,

643
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,027
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING
ELSE, SOMETHING
DRIVEN TO KILL.

644
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,948
BUT SYBO SAID THAT
IT FEEDS ON DEATH.

645
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,950
IN THE STRICT SCIENTIFIC
SENSE, DOCTOR,

646
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,077
WE ALL FEED ON DEATH,
EVEN VEGETARIANS.

647
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,790
YES, BUT IT SAID
MORE THAN THAT;
NOT JUST DEATH, BUT FEAR.

648
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,374
SAID IT ALSO FEEDS
ON FEAR.

649
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,418

TEND TO SUPPORT
THE PROPOSITION

650
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,170
THAT THE MURDERER
WAS NOT HUMAN.

651
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,380
DERIVING SUSTENANCE

653
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,802
AND FEAR IS AMONG
THE STRONGEST

654
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,137
AND MOST VIOLENT
OF THE EMOTIONS.

655
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,723
SURELY, PREFECT,
THIS HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH.

656
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,768

SOME MAN HAS KILLED
THREE WOMEN.

657
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,687
WE HAVE THE PRIME SUSPECT
IN OUR HANDS.

658
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,981
ARE WE GOING TO LET HIM GO
AND START CHASING GHOSTS?

659
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,359
NO, MR. HENGIST,

660
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,944
NOT GHOSTS.

661
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,696
POSSIBLY NOT HUMAN,
BUT NOT GHOSTS.

662
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,323

675

00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,318
WHEN IT'S AT REST,
IT'S SOLID.

691
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,741
MR. SPOCK, LET'S ASSUME THE
EXISTENCE OF THIS CREATURE.

692
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,577
I POINT OUT THAT
JACK THE RIPPER SLEW AT WILL

693
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,329
IN THE HEART OF THE MOST
POPULOUS CITY OF OLD EARTH

694
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,873
AND WAS NEVER IDENTIFIED.

695
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,332
DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY,
DOES IT?

696
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,544
I SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY
OF A HYPNOTIC SCREEN,

697
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,880
WHICH BLINDS ALL
BUT THE VICTIM

698
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,506
TO THE PRESENCE
OF THE KILLER.

699
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,550
IS THAT
POSSIBLE?

700
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,302
EXTREMELY POSSIBLE;
THERE ARE MANY SUCH

701
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,304
EXAMPLES THAT EXIST
IN NATURE.

702
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,264
WELL, THIS IS FANTASY!

703
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,850
WE ALL KNOW THE MURDERER IS
SITTING RIGHT HERE WITH US.

704
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,393
I MEAN, YOU'RE TRYING
TO CLOUD THE ISSUE.

705
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:46,895
I'VE GOT A MIND TO--

706
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:48,521
I AM SATISFIED
THE COURSE

707
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,649
OF THIS INVESTIGATION
IS VALID ENOUGH.

708
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,818
PLEASE BE SEATED,
MR. HENGIST.

709
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,699
ALL RIGHT, MR. SPOCK,
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

710
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:03,453
A CREATURE WITHOUT FORM

711
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:07,040
THAT FEEDS ON HORROR AND FEAR,

712
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:10,085
THAT MUST ASSUME
A PHYSICAL SHAPE

713
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,670
TO KILL.

714
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,672
AND, I SUSPECT,
PREYS ON WOMEN

715
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,674
BECAUSE WOMEN
ARE MORE EASILY

716
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,634
AND MORE DEEPLY
TERRIFIED,

717
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,846
GENERATING
MORE SHEER HORROR THAN
THE MALE OF THE SPECIES.

718
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,556
COMPUTER,
CRIMINOLOGICAL FILES.

719
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,559

731
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,672
10 WOMEN
KNIFED TO DEATH.

732
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,842
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL
EXAMPLES.

733
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:02,470
CAPTAIN, THOSE PLACES
ARE ALIGNED DIRECTLY

734
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,182
BETWEEN ARGELIUS
AND EARTH.

735
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,142
YES.

736
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:10,228
WHEN MAN MOVED OUT
INTO THE GALAXY,

737
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,773
THAT THING MUST'VE
MOVED WITH HIM.

738
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:16,818

THE PROPER NAMES

739
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,238

MASS MURDERER OF WOMEN

746
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,961

748
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,760
MURDERS ON RIGEL IV OCCURRED
ONE SOLAR YEAR AGO.

749
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,934
YOU COME FROM RIGEL IV.

750
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,937
WELL, MANY PEOPLE DO.
IT'S NOT A CRIME.

751
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,439
NO, BUT WHAT WE'RE
INVESTIGATING IS.

752
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,942
WOULD YOU MIND TAKING
THE STAND, MR. HENGIST?

753
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,193
WHY, I WILL NOT.

754
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,569
MR. HENGIST.

755
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,613
PREFECT,
THIS HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH.

756
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,489
I WILL NOT TAKE THE STAND.

757
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,533
I CAN APPRECIATE
YOUR POSITION, SIR.

758
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,536
YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF
CIVIL DISTURBANCES LOCALLY.

759
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,123
IF YOU ARE THE ENTITY
FOR WHICH WE SEARCH,

760
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,666
WHAT BETTER POSITION
FROM WHICH TO KILL

761
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,252
WITH IMPUNITY?

762
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,295
AND JUST AFTER YOU
LEFT JARIS' HOUSE,

763
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,672
WE DISCOVERED
THE MURDER KNIFE
WAS MISSING.

764
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,549
Kirk: AND YOU WERE
UNACCOUNTED FOR

765
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,093
WHEN LIEUTENANT TRACY
WAS MURDERED.

766
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,344
Spock:
AN ENTITY WHICH FEEDS

767
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,639
ON FEAR AND TERROR

768
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,683
WOULD FIND A PERFECT
HUNTING GROUND ON ARGELIUS,

769
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,769
A PLANET WITHOUT VIOLENCE,

770
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,605
WHERE THE INHABITANTS
ARE AS PEACEFUL AS SHEEP.

771
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,566
THE ENTITY WOULD BE

772
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,861
AS A HUNGRY WOLF
IN THAT FOLD.

773
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,822
GENTLEMEN, I KNOW
SOMETHING OF THE LAW.

774
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,616
YOU'RE ENGAGING
IN SHEER SPECULATION.

775
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,367
PERHAPS.

776
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,663
MR. SPOCK...

777
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,873
THE MURDER WEAPON.

778
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,834

00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,203
NOW, THEN, MR. HENGIST...

790
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,515
HE'S DEAD, JIM.

791
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,433
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

792
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,854
[HENGIST'S VOICE]

793

[MANIACAL LAUGHTER]

795
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,115
THE COMPUTER WILL NOT
RESPOND TO THESE CONTROLS.

796
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:11,784
THE ENTITY IS UNQUESTIONABLY
CONTROLLING IT.

797
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,786
AND THE COMPUTER

798
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,331
CONTROLS THE SHIP.

799
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,715
REDJAC! REDJAC!
REDJAC! REDJAC!
[MANIACAL LAUGHTER]

800
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,800
SCOTTY, GIVE ME A HAND.

801
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,180
NO USE, CAPTAIN.
THE BYPASS CIRCUITS
ARE BLOCKED.

802
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,266
AUDIO CUTOFF, SPOCK.

803
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,434
CAPTAIN!

804
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,022
Woman:
WHAT'S HAPPENING, CAPTAIN?

805
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,523
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

806
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,443
Kirk: IT MEANS
THAT THING CAN CONTROL

807
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,696
THE ENTIRE OPERATION
OF THE SHIP, INCLUDING
THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS.

808
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,531
YOU MEAN
IT COULD KILL US ALL?

809
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,533
INDEED IT WILL TRY,
BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY.

810
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,702
WE KNOW IT FEEDS
ON FEAR AND TERROR.

811
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,705
THERE ARE
NEARLY 440 HUMANS
ABOARD THIS SHIP.

812
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:00,750
SURELY IT WILL TRY
TO BREED FEAR AND
TERROR BEFORE IT KILLS.

813
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,460
ALL HANDS,
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN.

814
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,087
STAY AT YOUR POSTS.

815
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,713
REMAIN CALM.

818
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,263
WHAT'S
THE SEDATIVE SITUATION?

819
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:17,642
I'VE GOT SOME STUFF
THAT WOULD TRANQUILIZE
AN ACTIVE VOLCANO.

820
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,228
GOOD. START DISTRIBUTION
IMMEDIATELY.

821
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,605
THE LONGER WE CAN
HOLD BACK THAT FEAR,

822
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,650
THE MORE TIME WE'LL HAVE
TO GET THAT THING OUT
OF THE COMPUTER.

823
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:29,112
PREFECT,
YOU'LL ALL BE SAFER HERE.

824
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,197
SPOCK, COME WITH ME.

825
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,618
SPOCK, DON'T YOU HAVE
A COMPULSORY SCAN UNIT

826
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,203
BUILT INTO
THE COMPUTER BANKS?

827
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,164
YES, WE DO, CAPTAIN,
BUT WITH THE ENTITY
IN CONTROL--

828
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,207
WELL, AREN'T
THERE CERTAIN
MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS

829
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,209
WHICH SIMPLY
CANNOT BE SOLVED?
INDEED.

830
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,920
IF WE COULD FOCUS
THE ATTENTION OF THE
COMPUTER ON ONE OF THEM...

831
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,214
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

832
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,967
SPOCK!

833
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,428

WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME, CAPTAIN.

841
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,990
WELL, YOU SAID IT
YOURSELF, SPOCK,

842
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,118
IT WANTS TERROR,
NOT JUST DEATH.

843
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:24,376
CAPTAIN, THE LIFE
SUPPORT SYSTEM
OVERRIDE JAMMED.

844
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,378

846
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,048
CAPTAIN,
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

847
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,632
CUT THAT THING OFF.

848
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,676
YOU AND ALL ABOARD
YOUR SHIP

849
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,594
ARE ABOUT TO DIE!

850
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,847
TRY AND CUT
THAT THING OFF.

851
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,225
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I HEARD A MALFUNCTION
THREATEN US.

852
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,976
MAN YOUR POST, MR. SULU.

853
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,145
PREPARE YOUR

YOU MAY NEED THEM.

HAVE BEEN RESTORED,

857

WILL NOT LAST LONG,

858
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,036
A FEW HOURS AT BEST.

859
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,871
THAT SHOULD BE
ENOUGH TIME.

860
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,998
LET'S GET AT IT.

861
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,210
WHAT'S GOING ON,
CAPTAIN?

862
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,795
