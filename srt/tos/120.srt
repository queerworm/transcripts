<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 2947.3.</i>

2
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,719
<i>WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH</i>
<i>A SEVERE ION STORM.</i>

3
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,304
<i>ONE CREWMAN IS DEAD.</i>

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,056
<i>THE SHIP'S DAMAGE</i>
<i>IS CONSIDERABLE.</i>

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,976
<i>I HAVE ORDERED</i>
<i>A NONSCHEDULED LAYOVER</i>

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,854
<i>ON STARBASE 11</i>
<i>FOR REPAIRS.</i>

7
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,647
<i>A FULL REPORT OF DAMAGES</i>
<i>WAS MADE</i>

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:26,318
<i>TO THE COMMANDING OFFICER</i>
<i>OF STARBASE 11--</i>
<i>COMMODORE STONE.</i>

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,699
MAINTENANCE,
SECTION 18.

10
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,742
THE SECTION IS WORKING
ON THE<i> INTREPID.</i>

11
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:39,498
RESCHEDULE. THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
IS ON PRIORITY 1.

12
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,417
THAT MAKES THREE TIMES
YOU'VE READ IT, JIM.

13
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,961
IS THERE AN ERROR?

14
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,463
NO.

15
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,465
BUT THE DEATH
OF THE CREWMAN...

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,261
REGULATIONS, CAPTAIN.

17
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,472
AND THE EXTRACT FROM
YOUR SHIP'S COMPUTER LOG

18
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,517
CONFIRMING THIS
SWORN DEPOSITION?

19
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,768
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

20
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,186

<i>GO AHEAD, CAPTAIN.</i>

21
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,981
WHERE'S MR. SPOCK WITH
THAT COMPUTER LOG EXTRACT?

22
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,107
HE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN THERE
10 MINUTES AGO, SIR.

23
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,484
KIRK OUT.

24
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,527
IT'S A GREAT PITY.

25
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,862
THE SERVICE CAN'T
AFFORD

26
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:10,905
TO LOSE MEN
LIKE LIEUTENANT
COMMANDER FINNEY.

27
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,072
I AGREE.

28
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,491
I WAITED UNTIL
THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT.

29
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,160
WE WERE ON RED ALERT,
THE STORM GOT WORSE.

30
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,287
I HAD TO JETTISON
THE POD.

31
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,882
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG,
MR. SPOCK?

32
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,675
CAPTAIN...

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,384
I BELIEVE--

34
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,844
I'LL TAKE THAT.

35
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,436
JAME.

36
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,229
THERE YOU ARE.

37
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:48,067
I JUST WANTED ONE MORE
LOOK AT YOU--THE MAN
WHO KILLED MY FATHER.

38
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,401
THAT'S NOT SO.
HE WAS MY FRIEND.

39
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,736
YOUR FRIEND?

40
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,613
YOU HATED HIM
ALL YOUR LIFE!

41
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,657
THAT'S WHY
YOU KILLED HIM,
YOU MURDERER!

42
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:56,700
YOU MURDERER!

43
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,912
YOU MURDERER!

44
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,246
JAME.

45
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,044
MR. SPOCK,

46
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,712
WOULD YOU PLEASE...

47
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:16,011
MISS FINNEY,
COME WITH ME,
PLEASE.

48
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,930
CAPTAIN KIRK,

49
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,265
YOU SAY YOU JETTISONED
THE POD AFTER THE RED ALERT?

50
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,309
YOU HAVE
MY SWORN DEPOSITION.

51
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,811
THEN, CAPTAIN,
I MUST PRESUME

52
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,563
YOU HAVE COMMITTED
WILLFUL PERJURY.

53
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,232
THIS EXTRACT FROM
YOUR COMPUTER LOG SAYS
YOU JETTISONED THE POD

54
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,735
BEFORE GOING
TO RED ALERT.

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,821
CONSIDER YOURSELF
CONFINED TO THE BASE.

56
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,280
AN OFFICIAL INQUIRY
WILL DETERMINE

57
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,240

<i>I'M CONFIDENT</i>

71
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,322
TIMOTHY,
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU

72
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,326
SINCE THE VULCANIAN
EXPEDITION.

73
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,580
WELL, I SEE
OUR GRADUATING CLASS
FROM THE ACADEMY

74
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,165
IS WELL REPRESENTED.

75
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:12,753
ARGAN, HELLER...

76
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,129
HOW YOU DOING, MIKE?

77
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,256
I'LL GET BY, JIM.

78
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,218
I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE LAYING OVER
FOR REPAIRS.

79
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,552
BIG JOB?

80
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,929
COUPLE OF DAYS.

81
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,805
YOU MOVING OUT THEN?

82
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,348
IN A HURRY TO SEE ME GO?

83
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,767
OH, I JUST WONDERED
HOW LONG IT WOULD
TAKE YOU

84
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,978
TO GET A NEW
RECORDS OFFICER.

85
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,312
YOU CAN TALK
PLAINER THAN THAT.

86
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,981
I CAN,

87
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,567
BUT I THINK
THE POINT'S
BEEN MADE.

88
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,985
BEN WAS A FRIEND
OF OURS.

89
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:37,611
COME ON, JIM,
LET'S GO.

90
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,448
NO, GO ON. FINISH.

91
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,409
BEN WAS A FRIEND
OF YOURS, AND...

92
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,453
JIM.

93
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,788
GO ON.

94
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,123
I'M WAITING
TO HEAR THE REST.

95
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,834
WHY DON'T
YOU TELL US?

96
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,130
WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?

97
00:04:56,255 --> 00:05:03,095
YOU'VE ALREADY
MADE UP YOUR MINDS.

98
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,721
EXCUSE ME, BONES.

99
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,483
IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT,

100
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,278

OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

101
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,654
YES, I KNOW.

102
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,905
ARE YOU
A FRIEND OF HIS?

103
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,450

ONE OF THE FEW.

104
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,035

00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,036

00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,123

TOO...

108
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,457
AN OLD ONE.

109
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,669

THIS INQUIRY TO DETERMINE
WHETHER A GENERAL
COURT-MARTIAL

120
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,904

READY.

00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,746
LET US BEGIN
WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP

124
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,665
WITH COMMANDER FINNEY.

125
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,251
YOU KNEW HIM FOR
A LONG TIME, DIDN'T YOU?

126
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,712
YES. HE WAS
AN INSTRUCTOR
AT THE ACADEMY

127
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,754
WHEN I WAS
A MIDSHIPMAN.

128
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,839
THAT DIDN'T STAND
IN THE WAY

129
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,924
OF OUR BEGINNING
A CLOSE FRIENDSHIP.

130
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,592
HIS DAUGHTER JAME,
WHO WAS HERE LAST
NIGHT,

131
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,345
WAS NAMED AFTER ME.

132
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,014
IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE
THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

133
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,431
IT'S NO SECRET.

134
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,392
WE WERE ASSIGNED
TO THE SAME SHIP
SOME YEARS LATER.

135
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,729
I RELIEVED HIM
ON WATCH ONCE

136
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,814
AND FOUND A CIRCUIT
OPEN TO THE ATOMIC
MATTER PILES

137
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,774
THAT SHOULD'VE
BEEN CLOSED.

138
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,859
ANOTHER
FIVE MINUTES,

139
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,527
IT COULD HAVE
BLOWN UP THE SHIP.

140
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,780
<i>SHIP NOMENCLATURE--</i>
<i>SPECIFY.</i>

141
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,784
UNITED STARSHIP
<i>REPUBLIC,</i>
<i>NUMBER 1371.</i>

142
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,870
CONTINUE.

143
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,663
I CLOSED THE SWITCH

144
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,582
AND LOGGED
THE INCIDENT.

145
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,042
HE DREW A REPRIMAND

146
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,669
AND WAS SENT TO
THE BOTTOM OF
THE PROMOTION LIST.

147
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,380
AND HE BLAMED YOU
FOR THAT?

148
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,048
YES.

149
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,549
HE HAD BEEN
AT THE ACADEMY

150
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,302
FOR AN UNUSUALLY
LONG TIME AS
AN INSTRUCTOR.

151
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,762
AS A RESULT,
HE WAS LATE

152
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,931
IN BEING ASSIGNED
TO A STARSHIP.

153
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,974
THE DELAY, HE FELT,
LOOKED BAD ON
HIS RECORD.

154
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,102
MY ACTION,
HE BELIEVED,
MADE THINGS WORSE.

155
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,436
COMMENT--

156
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,521
SERVICE RECORD
OF LIEUTENANT

THIS INQUIRY.

158
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,192
<i>NOTED.</i>

159
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,279
NOW, LET'S GET INTO
THE SPECIFICS OF
THE STORM, CAPTAIN.

160
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,949
WEATHER SCAN
INDICATED AN ION STORM
DEAD AHEAD.

161
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,951
I SENT FINNEY
INTO THE POD.

162
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,202
WHY FINNEY?

163
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,536
HIS NAME WAS
AT THE TOP OF
THE DUTY ROSTER.

164
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,413
IF HE BLAMED YOU--

165
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,496
HE MAY HAVE
BLAMED ME

166
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,082
THAT HE NEVER ROSE
TO COMMAND A SHIP,

167
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,833
BUT I DON'T ASSIGN
JOBS ON THE BASIS
OF WHO BLAMES ME.

168
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,962
IT WAS
FINNEY'S TURN,
AND I ASSIGNED HIM.

169
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,632
HE HAD JUST
CHECKED IN WITH ME
FROM THE POD

170
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,885
WHEN WE HIT
THE LEADING EDGE
OF THE STORM.

171
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,012
NOT TOO BAD
AT FIRST...

172
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,681
I SIGNALED
A YELLOW ALERT.

173
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,392
THEN WE BEGAN
ENCOUNTERING
PRESSURE,

174
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,019
VARIANT STRESS,
FORCE 7, THE WORKS.

175
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,648
I FINALLY SIGNALED
A RED ALERT.

176
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,986
FINNEY KNEW HE HAD
A MATTER OF SECONDS.

177
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:10,782
I GAVE HIM
THOSE SECONDS
AND MORE.

178
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,741
BUT...

179
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,702
APPARENTLY
IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

180
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,414
THEN WHY CAPTAIN, DOES THE
COMPUTER LOG FROM YOUR SHIP

181
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,249
MADE AUTOMATICALLY
AT THE TIME,

182
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,460
INDICATE THAT YOU WERE
STILL ON YELLOW ALERT
WHEN YOU JETTISONED

183
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,879
AND NOT ON RED?

184
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,799
I DON'T KNOW.

185
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,259
THERE'S BEEN
A MISTAKE.

186
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,510
IT WOULD SEEM SO.

187
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,429
COULD THE COMPUTER
BE WRONG?

188
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,514
MR. SPOCK IS
RUNNING A SURVEY
RIGHT NOW,

189
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,101
BUT THE ODDS ARE
NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE.

190
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,980
STOP RECORDING.

191
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,648
NOW, LOOK, JIM...

192
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,819
NOT ONE MAN
IN A MILLION

193
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,654
COULD DO WHAT YOU
AND I HAVE DONE--

194
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,032
COMMAND A STARSHIP.

195
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,700
A HUNDRED
DECISIONS A DAY,

196
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,954
HUNDREDS OF LIVES
STAKED ON YOU MAKING
EVERY ONE OF THEM RIGHT.

197
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,873
YOU'RE PLAYED OUT, JIM.

198
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:00,790
EXHAUSTED.

199
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,250
IS THAT THE WAY
YOU SEE IT?

200
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,877
THAT'S THE WAY
MY REPORT WILL READ
IF YOU COOPERATE.

201
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,214
PHYSICAL BREAKDOWN,
POSSIBLY EVEN MENTAL
COLLAPSE?

202
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,465
POSSIBLY.

203
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,549
I'D BE ADMITTING
THAT A MAN DIED
BECAUSE--

204
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,758
ADMIT NOTHING.

205
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,719
SAY NOTHING.

206
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,388
LET ME BURY
THE MATTER HERE AND NOW.

207
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,515
NO STARSHIP CAPTAIN
HAS EVER STOOD TRIAL BEFORE,

208
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,099
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE THE FIRST.

209
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,600
BUT IF WHAT YOU SUSPECT
IS TRUE, THEN I'M
GUILTY.

210
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,685
I SHOULD BE PUNISHED.

211
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,522
I'M THINKING
OF THE SERVICE.

212
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,647
I WON'T
HAVE IT SMEARED.

213
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,068
BY WHAT,
COMMODORE STONE?

214
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,028
ALL RIGHT...

215
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,365
BY AN EVIDENT PERJURER
WHO IS EITHER COVERING UP
HIS BAD JUDGMENT,

216
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,615
HIS COWARDICE, OR
SOMETHING EVEN WORSE--

217
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,993
THAT'S AS FAR
AS YOU GO, SIR.

218
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,329
I'M TELLING YOU
I WAS THERE
ON THE BRIDGE.

219
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,122
I KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED.
I KNOW WHAT I DID.

220
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,707
IT'S IN THE TRANSCRIPT,

221
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,668
AND COMPUTER TRANSCRIPTS
DON'T LIE.

222
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,087
NOW, I'M TELLING YOU,
CAPTAIN,

223
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,713
EITHER YOU ACCEPT
A PERMANENT
GROUND ASSIGNMENT,

224
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,342
OR THE WHOLE
DISCIPLINARY WEIGHT
OF STARFLEET COMMAND

225
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,302
IS GOING TO ALIGHT
RIGHT ON YOUR NECK.

226
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,387
SO THAT'S THE WAY
WE DO IT NOW--

227
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,179
SWEEP IT
UNDER THE RUG

228
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,347
AND ME ALONG
WITH IT?

229
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,848
NOT ON YOUR LIFE.

230
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,016
I INTEND TO FIGHT.

231
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,102
THEN YOU DRAW
A GENERAL COURT.

232
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,228
DRAW IT?
I DEMAND IT.

233
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,604
AND RIGHT NOW,
COMMODORE STONE.

234
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,732
RIGHT NOW.

235
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,743
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG</i>
<i>STARDATE 2948.9</i>

236
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,995
<i>THE OFFICERS WHO WILL COMPRISE</i>

237
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,123

239
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:38,679
AREEL...

240
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,308
DR. McCOY SAID
YOU WERE HERE.

241
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,811
I SHOULD HAVE
FELT IT IN THE AIR
LIKE STATIC ELECTRICITY.

242
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,980
FLATTERY WILL
GET YOU EVERYWHERE.

243
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,072
IT'S BEEN...

244
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,158
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

245
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,328
FOUR YEARS, SEVEN
MONTHS, AND AN ODD
NUMBER OF DAYS--

246
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,745
NOT THAT
I'M COUNTING.

247
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,205
YOU LOOK MARVELOUS.

248
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,790
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED
A BIT.

249
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,543
BUT THINGS HAVE
CHANGED FOR YOU,
HAVEN'T THEY?

250
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,212
OH, YOU'VE HEARD
ABOUT THAT?

251
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,048
I'M A LAWYER IN
THE JUDGE ADVOCATE'S
OFFICE, REMEMBER?

252
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,300
I REMEMBER.

253
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,635
LET'S FORGET IT.

254
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,138
WE HAVE A LOT
OF LOST TIME
TO MAKE UP FOR.

255
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,182
YOU'RE TAKING IT
VERY LIGHTLY.

256
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,558
THE CONFIDENCE OF
AN INNOCENT MAN.

257
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,518
ARE YOU?

258
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:25,602
MM-HMM.

259
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,937
THAT'S NOT WHAT
THE RUMORS INDICATE.

260
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,230
LOOK--

261
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,774
LET'S NOT TALK SHOP.

262
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,776
JIM, THIS
COULD RUIN YOU.

263
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,403
WILL YOU TAKE
SOME ADVICE?

264
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,905
I NEVER COULD
TALK YOU INTO ANYTHING.

265
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,203
ALL RIGHT. FIRE AWAY.

266
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,246
THE PROSECUTION WILL
BUILD ITS CASE,

267
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,291
ON THE BASIS OF KIRK
VERSUS THE COMPUTER.

268
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,543
NOW, IF YOUR
ATTORNEY TRIES TO
DEFEND

269
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,711
ON THAT BASIS,
YOU WON'T HAVE
A CHANCE.

270
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,005
WHAT OTHER CHOICE
IS THERE?

271
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,507
THAT'S UP TO
YOUR ATTORNEY,

272
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,967
AND THAT'S WHY
HE'S GOT TO BE
A GOOD ONE.

273
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:58,968
YOU, PERHAPS?

274
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,054
NO. I--

275
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:01,929
I'M BUSY.

276
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,264
WELL...

277
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,683
A GIRL WITH YOUR
ABILITY

278
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,018
SHOULD BE ABLE TO
HANDLE TWO CASES AT ONCE.

279
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,229
JIM, BE SERIOUS.

280
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,771
YOU'RE NOT
AN ORDINARY HUMAN.

281
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,190
YOU'RE A STARSHIP
CAPTAIN,

282
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,609
AND YOU'VE STEPPED
INTO SCANDAL.

283
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,069
IF THERE'S ANY WAY
THEY CAN DO IT,

284
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,279
THEY'LL
SLAP YOU DOWN HARD
AND PERMANENTLY

285
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,824
FOR THE GOOD
OF THE SERVICE.

286
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,951
YOU STILL HAVEN'T MADE
ANY RECOMMENDATION.

287
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,745
SAMUEL T. COGLEY,
ATTORNEY-AT-LAW.

288
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,332
IF ANYONE CAN
SAVE YOU, HE CAN.

289
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,126
HE'LL BE PAYING YOU
A VISIT.

290
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,253
JIM, I'VE GOT TO GO.

291
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,714
AREEL...

292
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,756
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME
HOW YOU KNOW SO MUCH

293
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:42,053
ABOUT WHAT
THE PROSECUTION'S
GOING TO DO.

294
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:47,183
BECAUSE, JIM KIRK,
MY DEAR OLD LOVE...

295
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,603
I AM THE PROSECUTION,

296
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:54,023
AND I HAVE TO DO
MY VERY BEST TO HAVE
YOU SLAPPED DOWN HARD,

297
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,068
BROKEN
OUT OF THE SERVICE...

298
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,153
IN DISGRACE.

299
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,006
YOU KIRK?

300
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,300
YES.

301
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,429
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

302
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,846
I FIGURED WE'D BE
SPENDING SOME TIME
TOGETHER,

303
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:26,765
SO I MOVED IN.

304
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,225
I HOPE I'M NOT
CROWDING YOU.

305
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,017
WHAT'S THE
MATTER?

306
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:30,893
DON'T
YOU LIKE BOOKS?

307
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,604
OH, I LIKE THEM FINE,

308
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,355
BUT A COMPUTER
TAKES LESS SPACE.

309
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,232
HUH. A COMPUTER.

310
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,276
I GOT ONE OF THESE
IN MY OFFICE.

311
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,195
CONTAINS
ALL THE PRECEDENTS.

312
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:46,033
A SYNTHESIS OF ALL THE
GREAT LEGAL DECISIONS
WRITTEN THROUGHOUT TIME.

313
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,410
I NEVER USE IT.

314
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,286
WHY NOT?

315
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,704
I'VE GOT MY OWN SYSTEM.

316
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,457
BOOKS, YOUNG MAN, BOOKS.
THOUSANDS OF THEM.

317
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,750
IF TIME WASN'T SO IMPORTANT,

318
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,085
I'D SHOW YOU
SOMETHING--MY LIBRARY.

319
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,086
THOUSANDS OF BOOKS.

320
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,421
WHAT WOULD BE THE
POINT?

321
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,089
THIS IS WHERE
THE LAW IS,

322
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,802
NOT IN THAT HOMOGENIZED,
PASTEURIZED, SYNTHESIZED--

323
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,470
DO YOU WANT TO
KNOW THE LAW--

324
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,681
THE ANCIENT CONCEPTS
IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE,

325
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,475
LEARN THE INTENT
OF THE MEN
WHO WROTE THEM,

326
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,479
FROM MOSES
TO THE TRIBUNAL
OF ALPHA 3?

327
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,106
BOOKS.

328
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,150
YOU HAVE TO BE EITHER
AN EXCESSIVE CRACK BUD

329
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,318
WHO'S ESCAPED
FROM HIS KEEPER

330

OR SAMUEL T. COGLEY,

NEED A LAWYER?

372
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,956
MR. SPOCK,
AS A FIRST OFFICER,

373
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,750
YOU KNOW
A GREAT DEAL ABOUT
COMPUTERS, DON'T YOU?

374
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,251
I KNOW
ALL ABOUT THEM.

375
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,129
IT IS POSSIBLE FOR
A COMPUTER TO MALFUNCTION,
IS IT NOT?

376
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,088
AFFIRMATIVE.

377
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,715
DO YOU KNOW
OF ANY MALFUNCTION

378
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,468
WHICH HAS CAUSED
AN INACCURACY IN
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> COMPUTER?

379
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,761
NEGATIVE.

380
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,430
THAT ANSWER IS BASED ON
YOUR MECHANICAL SURVEY

381
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,932
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
COMPUTER

382
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,726
ORDERED BY THE DEFENDANT
PRIOR TO THIS TRIAL,
IS IT NOT?

383
00:16:58,852 --> 00:16:59,727
AFFIRMATIVE.

384
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,020
NOW THE STARDATE--

385
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,190
BUT THE COMPUTER
IS INACCURATE,
NEVERTHELESS.

386
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,066
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

387
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,027
IT REPORTS THAT
THE JETTISON BUTTON

388
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,237
WAS PRESSED BEFORE
THE RED ALERT.

389
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,699
IN OTHER WORDS, IT REPORTS
THAT CAPTAIN KIRK

390
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,868
WAS REACTING TO
AN EXTREME EMERGENCY

391
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,828
THAT DID NOT
THEN EXIST.

392
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,621
AND THAT
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

393
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,789
IS IT?

394
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,875
WERE YOU WATCHING HIM
THE EXACT MOMENT

395
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,376
HE PRESSED
THE JETTISON BUTTON?

396
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,378
NO. I WAS OCCUPIED.

397
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,839
THE SHIP WAS ALREADY
ON YELLOW ALERT.

398
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,175
THEN HOW CAN YOU
DISPUTE THE FINDING
OF THE LOG?

399
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,302
I DO NOT DISPUTE IT.

400
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,805
I MERELY STATE
THAT IT IS WRONG.

401
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,683
OH? ON WHAT DO YOU
BASE THAT STATEMENT?

402
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,434
I KNOW THE CAPTAIN.
HE IS IN--

403
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,312
PLEASE INSTRUCT
THE WITNESS
NOT TO SPECULATE.

404
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,480
LIEUTENANT,

405
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,774
I AM HALF VULCANIAN.

406
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,860
VULCANIANS
DO NOT SPECULATE.

407
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,153
I SPEAK
FROM PURE LOGIC.

408
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,822
IF I LET GO OF
A HAMMER

409
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,199
ON A PLANET
THAT HAS A POSITIVE
GRAVITY,

410
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,826
I NEED NOT
SEE IT FALL

411
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,328
TO KNOW THAT IT HAS,
IN FACT, FALLEN.

412
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,705
I DO NOT SEE WHAT--

413
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,998
GENTLEMEN,

414
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,417
HUMAN BEINGS HAVE
CHARACTERISTICS

415
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,586
JUST AS INANIMATE
OBJECTS DO.

416
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,422
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
FOR CAPTAIN KIRK

417
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,759
TO ACT OUT OF PANIC
OR MALICE.

418
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,510
IT IS NOT
HIS NATURE.

419
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:18,806
IN YOUR OPINION.

420
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,351

AN EXPERT IN PSYCHOLOGY,

459
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,703
ESPECIALLY
SPACE PSYCHOLOGY--

460

PATTERNS WHICH DEVELOP

JUST HEARD TESTIMONY

464

OF YOUR OWN
PERSONNEL OFFICER,

465
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,217
THAT IT WAS AN ACTION
OF THE THEN ENSIGN KIRK

466
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,094
WHICH PLACED
AN UNERASABLE BLOT

467

ON THE RECORD
OF THE THEN
LIEUTENANT FINNEY.

468
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,808
PSYCHOLOGICALLY,
DOCTOR, IS IT POSSIBLE

469
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,393
THAT LIEUTENANT
FINNEY BLAMED KIRK

470
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,062
FOR THE INCIDENT?

471
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,730
IT'S POSSIBLE.

472
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,649
HE COULD HAVE HATED KIRK
DOWN THROUGH THE YEARS,

473
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,443
BLAMED HIM FOR BEING
PASSED OVER FOR PROMOTION,

474
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,947
BLAMED HIM FOR NEVER
BEING GIVEN A COMMAND
OF HIS OWN, CORRECT?

475
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,240
HE COULD HAVE.

476
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,826
NOW LET US
HYPOTHESIZE, DOCTOR.

477
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,704
IS IT NORMAL FOR A PERSON
TO RETURN AFFECTION
FOR HATRED?

478
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,288
NO.

479
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,209
DO WE NOT TEND TO
AT FIRST RESENT AND THEN
ACTIVELY DISLIKE

480
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,418
THE PERSON
WHO HATES US?

481
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,253
WAIT A MINUTE.
I DON'T QUITE
FOLLOW YOU.

482
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,296
HYPOTHETICALLY.

483
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,091
WOULD NOT CAPTAIN SMITH

484
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,135
BEGIN TO HATE LIEUTENANT
COMMANDER JONES

485
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,637
ONCE HE LEARNED THAT
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER JONES

486
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,348
HATED AND DETESTED HIM?

487
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,226
WELL, YES, I SUPPOSE
IT COULD HAPPEN.

488
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,728
THEN I ASK YOU,
IS IT NOT POSSIBLE

489
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,271
THAT CAPTAIN KIRK
BECAME AWARE

490
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,066
OF LIEUTENANT COMMANDER
FINNEY'S HATRED TOWARD HIM

491
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,735
AND PERHAPS,
EVEN INVOLUNTARILY,

492
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,361
BEGAN TO RECIPROCATE?

493
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,780
NOT CAPTAIN KIRK.

494
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,699
ANY NORMAL HUMAN, DOCTOR.
IS IT POSSIBLE?

495
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,576
BUT HE'S NOT THAT
KIND OF A MAN.

496
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,872
IS IT THEORETICALLY
POSSIBLE, DOCTOR?

497
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,249
YES.

498
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,333
IT'S POSSIBLE.

499
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,002

542
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,818
WAS THERE INDEED
A RED ALERT

543
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,196
BEFORE YOU
JETTISONED THE POD?

544
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,989
YES, SIR, THERE WAS.

545
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,075
PLEASE TELL US
ABOUT IT.

546
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,247
FIRSTLY, I AM AT A LOSS
TO EXPLAIN THE ERRORS

00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:37,208
IN THE EXTRACT

548
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,877
WE WERE IN AN ION STORM.

549
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,297
EVERYONE HERE IN THIS COURT
KNOWS THE DANGERS INVOLVED.

550
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,507
I WAS IN COMMAND.

551
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,468
THE DECISIONS WERE MINE,
NO ONE ELSE'S.

552
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,721
CHARGES OF MALICE
HAVE BEEN RAISED.

553
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,349
THERE WAS NO MALICE.

554
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,269
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER FINNEY
WAS A MEMBER OF MY CREW,

555
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:59,730
AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY
HE WAS TREATED.

556
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,483
IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT
I PANICKED ON THE BRIDGE

557
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,112
AND JETTISONED THE ION POD
PREMATURELY.

558
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,906
THAT IS NOT SO.

559
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,909
YOU HAVE HEARD SOME OF THE
DETAILS OF MY RECORD.

560
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,370
THIS WAS NOT
MY FIRST CRISIS.

561
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,454
IT WAS ONE OF MANY.

562
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,251
DURING IT, I DID
WHAT MY EXPERIENCE
AND TRAINING

563
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,420
REQUIRED ME TO DO.

564
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,463
I TOOK THE PROPER STEPS
IN THE PROPER ORDER.

565
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,217
I DID EXACTLY
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE

566
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,594
EXACTLY WHEN IT
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE.

567
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,138
YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING,

568
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,472
BUT WOULD YOU
DO IT AGAIN?

569
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,813
GIVEN THE SAME
CIRCUMSTANCES...

570
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:44,358
I WOULD DO THE SAME THING
WITHOUT HESITATION...

571
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,360
BECAUSE THE STEPS I TOOK

572
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,363
IN THE ORDER I TOOK THEM

573
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,407
WERE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

574
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,492
IF I WERE TO SAVE MY SHIP.

575
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,037
AND NOTHING...

576
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,290
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN MY SHIP.

577
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,757
YOUR WITNESS, MISS SHAW.

578
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,974
THE PROSECUTION
DOES NOT WISH
TO DISHONOR THIS MAN,

579
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,600
BUT FACTS ARE FACTS.

580
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,103

00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,975
BUT I HAVE TO.

690
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,686
I NEVER REALIZED
HOW CLOSE YOU
AND DAD HAD BEEN

691
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,105
UNTIL I READ
THROUGH SOME OF THE
PAPERS HE WROTE,

692
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,525
LETTERS TO MOTHER
AND ME.

693
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,903
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I EVER COULD'VE
THOUGHT THAT YOU...

694
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,822
MR. COGLEY,

695
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,532
RUINING JIM
WON'T CHANGE

696
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:26,659
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

697
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,661
THAT'S VERY COMMENDABLE,
MISS FINNEY,

698
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,245
BUT MOST UNUSUAL.

699
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,414
AFTER ALL,
CAPTAIN KIRK IS ACCUSED

700
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,166
OF CAUSING
YOUR FATHER'S DEATH,

701
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,418
AND THE EVIDENCE
WOULD INDICATE HIS GUILT.

702
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,003
I WAS JUST
THINKING OF JIM.

703
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:41,131
I KNOW,
AND I THANK YOU.

704
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,966
I HAVE TO GO AND CHANGE.
YOU READY?

705
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:50,599
NO, BUT I MAY
BE GETTING READY.

706
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:54,102
<i>BISHOP HALF LEVEL RIGHT.</i>

707
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,729
WELL, I HAD TO SEE IT
TO BELIEVE IT.

708
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,605
EXPLAIN.

709
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,815
THEY'RE ABOUT
TO LOP OFF

710
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,358
THE CAPTAIN'S
PROFESSIONAL HEAD,

711
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,401
AND YOU'RE SITTING
HERE PLAYING CHESS
WITH THE COMPUTER.

712
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,153
THAT IS TRUE.

713
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,904
MR. SPOCK,
YOU'RE THE MOST
COLD-BLOODED MAN

714
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,282
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

715
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,618
WHY, THANK YOU,
DOCTOR.

716
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,830
I'VE JUST WON
MY FOURTH GAME.

717
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,913
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

718
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,415
OBSERVE
FOR YOURSELF.

719
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,377
ROOK TO KING'S
PAWN 4.

720
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,213
<i>BISHOP</i>
<i>HALF LEVEL RIGHT.</i>

721
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,966
NOW, THIS IS
THE COMPUTER'S MOVE.

722
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:30,556
AND NOW MINE.

723
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:34,434
CHECKMATE.

724
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,562
MECHANICALLY, THE
COMPUTER IS FLAWLESS.

725
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,313
THEREFORE, LOGICALLY,
ITS REPORT

726
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,607
OF THE CAPTAIN'S GUILT
IS INFALLIBLE.

727
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,568
I COULD NOT
ACCEPT THAT, HOWEVER.

728
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,361
SO YOU TESTED
THE PROGRAM BANK.

729
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,779
EXACTLY.

730
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,156
I PROGRAMMED IT
MYSELF FOR CHESS
SOME MONTHS AGO.

731
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,700
THE BEST
I SHOULD'VE BEEN
ABLE TO OBTAIN

732
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,451
WAS A DRAW.

733
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:54,204
WELL, WHY ARE YOU
JUST SITTING THERE?

734
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,832

MR. COGLEY!

747
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,882
SIR,
SOME NEW EVIDENCE

748
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,550
HAS JUST
BEEN BROUGHT
TO MY ATTENTION,

749
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,009
AND I'D LIKE
TO ASK THE COURT--

750
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,303
OBJECTION!

751
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,639
COUNSEL FOR
THE DEFENSE HAS
RESTED HIS CASE.

752
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:55,599
OF WHAT NATURE
IS THIS EVIDENCE?

753
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,392
I CAN'T TELL YOU.
I HAVE TO SHOW YOU,
SIR.

754
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,978
MR. COGLEY
IS WELL-KNOWN
FOR HIS THEATRICS.

755
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,440
IS SAVING
AN INNOCENT MAN'S
CAREER A THEATRIC?

756
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,525

DIRECT THEIR REMARKS

AND OF JUSTINIAN,

THESE DOCUMENTS
ALL SPEAK OF RIGHTS.

768
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,430
RIGHTS
OF THE ACCUSED

769
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,516

BY HIS PEERS,

770
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,726

THE RIGHTS OF

BUT
MOST IMPORTANTLY,

773
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,399
THE RIGHT
TO BE CONFRONTED

774
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,401
BY THE WITNESSES
AGAINST HIM--

775
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,570
A RIGHT TO
WHICH MY CLIENT
HAS BEEN DENIED.

776
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,113
YOUR HONOR,
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

777
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,032
WE PRODUCED
THE WITNESSES IN COURT.

778
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,951
MY LEARNED OPPONENT
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

779
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,369
TO SEE THEM,
CROSS-EXAMINE THEM--

780
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,371
ALL BUT ONE!

781
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,248
THE MOST
DEVASTATING WITNESS
AGAINST MY CLIENT

782
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,042
IS NOT A HUMAN BEING.

783
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,085
IT'S A MACHINE,

784
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,880
AN INFORMATION
SYSTEM--

785
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,965
THE COMPUTER LOG
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

786
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,092
AND I ASK THIS COURT
ADJOURN AND RECONVENE
ABOARD THAT VESSEL.

787
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,093
I PROTEST,
YOUR HONOR.

788
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,305
AND I REPEAT,
I SPEAK OF RIGHTS.

789
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,932
A MACHINE HAS NONE.

790
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,809
A MAN MUST.

791
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,896
MY CLIENT HAS THE RIGHT
TO FACE HIS ACCUSER,

792
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:26,648
AND IF YOU DO NOT
GRANT HIM THAT RIGHT,

793
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,691
YOU HAVE BROUGHT US DOWN

794
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,442
TO THE LEVEL
OF THE MACHINE.

795
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:33,864
INDEED, YOU HAVE ELEVATED
THAT MACHINE ABOVE US.

796
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,700
I ASK THAT MY MOTION
BE GRANTED,

797
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,744
AND MORE
THAN THAT, GENTLEMEN,

798
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,038
IN THE NAME
OF HUMANITY,

799
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,373
FADING IN THE SHADOW
OF THE MACHINE,

800
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,166
I DEMAND IT.

801
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,002
I DEMAND IT!

802
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:56,344
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 2950.1.</i>

804
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,765
<i>THE GENERAL COURT-MARTIAL</i>
<i>HAS RECONVENED</i>

00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,474
<i>ON BOARD THE</i> ENTERPRISE.

806
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,727
HOW MANY GAMES OF CHESS
DID YOU WIN

807
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,395
FROM THE COMPUTER,
MR. SPOCK?

808
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,230
FIVE IN ALL.

809
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,024
MAY THAT BE
CONSIDERED UNUSUAL?

810
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,025
AFFIRMATIVE.

811
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,818
WHY?

812
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,112
I PERSONALLY
PROGRAMMED THE
COMPUTER FOR CHESS

813
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,447
MONTHS AGO.

814
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,699
I GAVE THE MACHINE
AN UNDERSTANDING
OF THE GAME

815
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,534
EQUAL TO MY OWN.

816
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,954
THE COMPUTER CANNOT
MAKE AN ERROR.

817
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,539
AND ASSUMING THAT
I DO NOT EITHER,

818
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,583
THE BEST THAT COULD
NORMALLY
BE HOPED FOR

819
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,252
WOULD BE STALEMATE
AFTER STALEMATE,

820
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,255
AND YET I BEAT
THE MACHINE
FIVE TIMES.

821
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,468
SOMEONE, EITHER
ACCIDENTALLY
OR DELIBERATELY,

822
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,219
ADJUSTED
THE PROGRAMMING

823
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,596
AND, THEREFORE,
THE MEMORY BANKS

824
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,847
OF THAT COMPUTER.

825
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:47,479
COULD THAT HAVE HAD AN EFFECT ON
THE VISUAL PLAYBACK WE SAW?

826
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:48,647
OBJECT!

827
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,650
THE WITNESS WOULD BE
MAKING A CONCLUSION.

828
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:52,859
SUSTAINED.

829
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:55,112
HYPOTHETICALLY,
MR. SPOCK.

830
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,072
HYPOTHETICALLY,

831
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,199
IF WHAT YOU SUGGEST
HAD BEEN DONE,

832
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,202
IT WOULD BE BEYOND
THE CAPABILITIES
OF MOST MEN.

833
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,621
IS THAT TRUE?

834
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:05,998
AFFIRMATIVE.

835
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:09,793
WHAT MAN ABOARD SHIP
WOULD IT NOT
BE BEYOND?

836
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,336
THE CAPTAIN,
MYSELF,

837
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,796
AND THE RECORDS
OFFICER.

838
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,090
MM-HMM.
AND AT THE MOMENT,

839
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,800
YOU HAVE
NO RECORDS OFFICER.

840
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:17,884
AFFIRMATIVE.

841
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,344
UNTIL HE WAS LOST,

842
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:22,764

WAS LIEUTENANT

843
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,808
CAPTAIN KIRK,

844
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,559
WILL YOU TELL
THE STEPS YOU TOOK

845
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,521
TO FIND MR. FINNEY
AFTER THE STORM?

846
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,815
I INSTITUTED
A PHASE 1 SEARCH.

847
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,900
DESCRIBE
A PHASE 1 SEARCH.

848
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,319
IT'S A PAINSTAKING,
THOROUGH ATTEMPT

849
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,696
IN AND AROUND
THE SHIP

850
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,280
TO FIND A MAN WHO'S
PRESUMABLY INJURED

851
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,740
AND UNABLE
TO RESPOND.

852
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,450
IT PRESUPPOSES,
DOES IT NOT,

853
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,578
THAT A MAN WISHES
TO BE FOUND?

854
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:46,579
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

855
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,207
IF YOU START
A SEARCH
FOR A MAN,

856
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,668
YOU ASSUME, DON'T YOU,
THAT HE WANTS
TO BE FOUND?

857
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,003
HE'S NOT HIDING?

858
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,921
YES.

859
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,215
ON A SHIP
OF THIS SIZE,

860
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,095
COULD A MAN
EVADE SUCH A SEARCH?

861
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,724
POSSIBLY.

862
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,685
GENTLEMEN,

00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:55,122
IT'S NOT A FIRST
EDITION OR ANYTHING--
JUST A BOOK.

1038
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,709
SAM SAYS THAT
MAKES IT SPECIAL,
THOUGH.

1039
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,627
I DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHANCE
TO THANK HIM.

1040
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,838
HE'S BUSY
ON A CASE.

1041
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,256
HE'S DEFENDING
BEN FINNEY.

1042
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,800
HE SAYS HE'LL WIN.

1043
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:09,094
I WOULDN'T BE
A BIT SURPRISED.

1044
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,222
DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD CAUSE
A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN

1045
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,557
OF DISCIPLINE

1046
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:15,393
IF A LOWLY LIEUTENANT
KISSED A STARSHIP CAPTAIN

1047
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:18,937
ON THE BRIDGE
OF HIS SHIP?

1048
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,690
LET'S TRY.

1049
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:30,949
SEE? NO CHANGE.

1050
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,869
DISCIPLINE
GOES ON.

1051
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,246
AND SO MUST
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

1052
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:37,623
GOODBYE, JIM.

1053
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:39,709
GOODBYE, AREEL.

1054
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,127
BETTER LUCK
NEXT TIME.

1055
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,422
I HAD PRETTY GOOD LUCK
THIS TIME.

1056
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:47,091
I LOST, DIDN'T I?

1057
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,529
SHE'S A VERY GOOD LAWYER.

1058
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,572
OBVIOUSLY.

1059
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,198
INDEED SHE IS.
