1
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:20,855
THE DISTRESS CALL
DEFINITELY CAME

2
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,691
FROM ONE OF THE SOLAR
SYSTEMS IN THIS SECTOR,
CAPTAIN.

3
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,526
CAN YOU PINPOINT IT
ANY CLOSER, LIEUTENANT?

4
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,319
NEGATIVE. IT WAS
SO BADLY GARBLED

5
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,321
ALL WE GOT WAS
THE NAME<i> CONSTELLATION.</i>

6
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:29,947
THEN WE LOST IT.

7
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,282
[SULU]
SIR...

8
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,870
WE'RE NOW
WITHIN THE LIMITS
OF SYSTEM L-370,

9
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:37,162
BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO
LOCATE--

10
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,289
CAPTAIN, SENSORS SHOW

11
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,583
THIS ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM
HAS BEEN DESTROYED.

12
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,800
NOTHING LEFT BUT
RUBBLE AND ASTEROIDS.

13
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,677
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

14
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:54,555
THE STAR IN THIS SYSTEM
IS STILL INTACT.

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,182
ONLY A NOVA COULD
DESTROY LIKE THAT.

16
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,519
NONETHELESS, CAPTAIN,
SENSORS SHOW
NOTHING BUT DEBRIS

17
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,897
WHERE WE CHARTED
7 PLANETS LAST YEAR.

18
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:05,399
CONTINUE
SEARCH PATTERN.

19
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,525
AYE-AYE, SIR.

20
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,996
ENTERING LIMITS
OF SYSTEM L-374, SIR.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,415
SCANNERS SHOW THE SAME
EVIDENCE OF DESTRUCTION.

22
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,420
EVERY SOLAR SYSTEM
IN THIS SECTOR

23
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,338
BLASTED TO RUBBLE.

24
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,299
STILL NO SIGN
OF THE<i> CONSTELLATION.</i>

25
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,384
MATT DECKER'S
IN COMMAND.

26
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,594
WHAT COULD HAVE
HAPPENED TO HIM?

27
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,178
CAPTAIN, THE TWO
INNERMOST PLANETS
OF THIS SYSTEM

28
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,889
APPEAR TO BE INTACT.

29
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,391
SIR, I'M PICKING
UP A SHIP'S
DISASTER BEACON.

30
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,351
TRY TO RAISE IT,
LIEUTENANT.

31
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,395
I HAVE IT ON
THE SENSORS, CAPTAIN.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,646
BY CONFIGURATION--
A STARSHIP.

33
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,650
STOPPED IN SPACE.
SHE APPEARS TO
BE DRIFTING.

34
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:49,860
NO ANSWER,
CAPTAIN.

35
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,946
ALL I GET IS
THE AUTOMATIC
BEACON.

36
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,907
SENSORS NOT RECORDING
NORMAL ENERGY OUTPUT.

37
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,535
APPROACH COURSE,
MR. SULU.

38
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,051
IT'S THE<i> CONSTELLATION.</i>

39
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,220
LOOK AT THAT.

40
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,597
SHE MAY
HAVE BEEN WRECKED

41
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,349
BY WHATEVER DESTROYED
THESE SOLAR SYSTEMS.

42
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,611
SHE WAS ATTACKED.

43
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,032
RED ALERT!
RED ALERT!

44
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,784
MAN YOUR
BATTLE STATIONS!

45
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,953
<i>RED ALERT!</i>
<i>RED ALERT!</i>

46
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,080
<i>MAN YOUR</i>

47
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,720
<i>SPACE--</i>
<i>THE FINAL FRONTIER.</i>

48
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,813
<i>THESE ARE THE VOYAGES</i>
<i>OF THE STARSHIP</i> ENTERPRISE.

49
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,357
<i>ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--</i>

50
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,027
<i>TO EXPLORE</i>
<i>STRANGE NEW WORLDS...</i>

51
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,779
<i>TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE</i>
<i>AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...</i>

52
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,533
<i>TO BOLDLY GO WHERE</i>
<i>NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.</i>

53
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,915
MR. SULU?

54
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,499
ALL PHASER BANKS
MANNED AND READY, SIR.

55
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,168
GOOD. INITIATE
A FULL SENSOR SCAN
OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA

56
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,502
FOR ANY OTHER VESSEL.

57
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,503
AYE, SIR.

58
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,713
LIEUTENANT PALMER.

59
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,464
I CAN'T RAISE
THE<i> CONSTELLATION,</i> SIR.

60
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,050
I'M STILL GETTING
THE DISTRESS BEACON,

61
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,177
BUT THERE'S HEAVY
SUBSPACE INTERFERENCE.

62
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,803
IT'S ALMOST
BLOCKING THE SIGNAL.

63
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:22,554
KEEP TRYING.

64
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,681
MR. SPOCK, FULL
EVALUATION OF THE DAMAGE

65
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,933
TO THE<i> CONSTELLATION.</i>

66
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,517
ALL POWER PLANTS DEAD.

67
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,437
RESERVE ENERGY BANKS
OPERABLE AT A VERY
LOW POWER LEVEL.

68
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,479
LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS?

69
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,524
ALSO OPERATIVE
AT A LOW POWER LEVEL.

70
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,819
THE ENTIRE BRIDGE IS
DAMAGED AND UNINHABITABLE.

71
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,780
THE REST OF THE SHIP
SEEMS ABLE TO SUSTAIN LIFE.

72
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:40,989
RADIATION LEVELS?

73
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,785
NORMAL, BUT SUBSPACE
INTERFERENCE MAKES
READINGS DIFFICULT.

74
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,494
NO OTHER VESSELS
IN THE AREA, CAPTAIN.

75
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,537
ALL SCANNERS
SHOW CLEAR.

76
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,220
ALL HANDS
GO TO YELLOW ALERT.

77
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,847
STAND BY
BATTLE STATIONS.

78
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,142
LIEUTENANT, HAVE
DR. McCOY, MR. SCOTT,

79
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,394
AND A DAMAGE CONTROL
PARTY REPORT TO ME IN
THE TRANSPORTER ROOM.

80
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,520
AYE, SIR.

81
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,772
WE'RE GOING
TO BOARD HER.

82
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,690
MR. SPOCK,
YOU'RE IN COMMAND.

83
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:16,608
ACKNOWLEDGED.

84
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,962
RADIATION LEVEL
NORMAL.

85
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,131
ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE
11 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH.

86
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,217
THE FILTRATION
SYSTEMS ARE
OUT, SIR.

87
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,761
THE WHOLE COMMUNICATION
SYSTEM LOOKS TO BE
SHORTED OUT, TOO, SIR.

88
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,262
SCOTTY, CHECK
THE PHASER BANKS.

89
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,263
SEE IF THEY'VE
BEEN FIRED.

90
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,473
BONES, YOU
COME WITH ME.

91
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,808
COME ALONG, LADS.

92
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,251
WHAT A MESS.

93
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,880
NO CLUTTER,
NO HALF-EMPTY
CUPS OF COFFEE.

94
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,549
WHATEVER HAPPENED
DIDN'T HAPPEN
WITHOUT A WARNING.

95
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,967
WHAT DO YOU THINK
DID IT, SIR?

96
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,844
I DON'T KNOW, LAD.

97
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,306
BUT I WANT
A FULL STRUCTURAL AND
CONTROL DAMAGE CHECK,

98
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,641
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE
A LOOK AT THOSE ENGINES.

99
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,521
THE CREW WASN'T ABDUCTED,
THEY JUST LEFT.

100
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,480
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

101
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,024
<i>ENTERPRISE,</i>
<i>SPOCK HERE.</i>

102
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,319
NO SURVIVORS,
NO BODIES EITHER.

103
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,863
IS IT POSSIBLE THEY
WERE BEAMED DOWN
TO ONE OF THE TWO PLANETS?

104
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,156
IMPROBABLE, CAPTAIN.

105
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:50,035
THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE
OF THE INNER PLANET IS
THAT OF MOLTEN LEAD.

106
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,537
THE OTHER HAS AN
ATMOSPHERE POISONOUS
TO HUMAN LIFE.

107
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,373
WE'LL CONTINUE OUR SEARCH.
KIRK OUT.

108
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,926
CAPTAIN, I CHECKED
THE ENGINES.

109
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,096
THE WARP DRIVE IS
A HOPELESS PILE
OF JUNK.

110
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,764
THE IMPULSE ENGINES
ARE NOT TOO BADLY OFF.

111
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,349
WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE
TO DO SOMETHING
WITH THEM.

112
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,558
PHASER BANKS?

113
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,395
EXHAUSTED. THEY
DIDN'T GIVE UP
WITHOUT A BATTLE.

114
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,272
BUT WHERE ARE THEY?

115
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,232
I CAN'T IMAGINE
A MAN LIKE MATT DECKER
ABANDONING SHIP

116
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,068
WHILE HIS LIFE SUPPORT
SYSTEMS ARE STILL
OPERATIVE.

117
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,652
THE COMPUTER SYSTEM
IS STILL INTACT.

118
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,405
WE CAN PLAY BACK
THE DUPLICATE
CAPTAIN'S LOG

119
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,866
FROM THE AUXILIARY
CONTROL ROOM.

120
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,130
MATT.

121
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,714
MATT.

122
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,633
IT'S JIM KIRK.

123
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,099
COMMODORE?

124
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,977
COMMODORE DECKER?

125
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,447
MATT?

126
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,282
MATT.

127
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,994
KIRK.

128
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,413
IT'S JIM KIRK.

129
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,580
WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOUR SHIP, MATT?

130
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,793
MY SHIP...

131
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,837
ATTACKED!
THAT--THAT THING.

132
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:24,796
WHAT THING?
WHAT WAS IT?

133
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,507
THAT--

134
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,137
ANSWER ME!
WHAT WAS IT?

135
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,554
WHAT HAPPENED, MATT?

136
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,390
JIM, GIVE HIM
A MINUTE.

137
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,557
HE'S IN A STATE
OF SHOCK.

138
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,186
READY WITH
THE DUPLICATE
LOG, SIR.

139
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,605
GO.

140
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,775
Matt Decker:

149
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,550
AND BEAM THEM ABOARD

150
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,593
I WANT A FULL
ANALYSIS--A COMPLETE
REPORT OF WHAT HAPPENED

151
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,304
WHEN THEY WENT IN

152
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,974

153
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,726
UH, NO ONE HEARD.

154
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,062
NO ONE!

155
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,938
WE COULDN'T RUN.

156
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,606
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR CREW?

157
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,068
OH, I HAD TO BEAM THEM DOWN.

158
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,944
WE--WE WERE DEAD.

159
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,613

160
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,409
I STAYED BEHIND,

161

162
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,580
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO DO, ISN'T IT?

163
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,000
AND THEN IT HIT AGAIN,

164
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,462
AND THE, UH,
TRANSPORTER WENT OUT.

165
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,383
THEY WERE DOWN THERE,
AND I'M--I'M UP HERE.

166
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,552
WHAT HIT?
WHAT ATTACKED YOU?

167
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,100
THEY SAY THERE'S
NO DEVIL, JIM,

168
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,185
BUT THERE IS.

169
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,771

172
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:10,777

173
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,113
THERE IS
NO THIRD PLANET.

174
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,077
DON'T YOU THINK
I KNOW THAT?

175
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,872
THERE WAS,
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

176
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,708
THEY CALLED ME.
THEY BEGGED ME FOR HELP,

177
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,211
400 OF THEM.

178
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,796
I COULDN'T.

179
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,090
I--I COULDN'T.

180
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,390
CAPTAIN, WASHBURN
HAS OUR REPORT.

181
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,772
GO.

182
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,401
WE MADE A COMPLETE
CHECK ON STRUCTURAL
AND CONTROL DAMAGE, SIR.

183
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,693
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL,

184
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,279
SOMETHING CRASHED
THROUGH THE DEFLECTORS

185
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,780
AND KNOCKED
OUT THE GENERATORS.

186
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,616
SOMEHOW THE ANTIMATTER

187
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,201
IN THE WARP DRIVE PODS
HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED.

188
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,786
DEACTIVATED.

189
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,163
SCOTTY,

190
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,956
COULD SOME
KIND OF...

191
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,460
GENERAL ENERGY
DAMPENING FIELD DO THAT,

192
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,752
AND WOULD THE SAME
TYPE OF THING

193
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,671
ACCOUNT FOR THE HEAVY
SUBSPACE INTERFERENCE?

194
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,048
AYE, THAT
ALL ADDS UP.

195
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,550
BUT WHAT
SORT OF A THING
COULD DO ALL THAT?

196
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,135
IF YOU'D SEEN IT,
YOU'D KNOW.

197
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,471
THE WHOLE THING
IS A WEAPON.
IT MUST BE.

198
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,098
WHAT DOES
IT LOOK LIKE?

199
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,392
WELL, IT'S--IT'S
MILES LONG,

200
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,853
WITH A MAW
THAT COULD SWALLOW

201
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,813
A DOZEN STARSHIPS.

202
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,358
IT DESTROYS PLANETS,

203
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,900
CHOPS THEM INTO RUBBLE.

204
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,112
WHAT IS IT,
AN ALIEN SHIP?
OR IS IT ALIVE--

205
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,448
BOTH OR NEITHER.
I DON'T KNOW.

206
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,368
MATT, YOUR LOG STATED

207
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,036
THAT THE FOURTH PLANET
WAS BREAKING UP.

208
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:43,786
YOU WENT IN
TO INVESTIGATE.

209
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,622
WE SAW
THIS THING HOVERING
OVER THE PLANET,

210
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,875
SLICING OUT CHUNKS OF IT
WITH A FORCE BEAM.

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,961
DID YOU RUN
A SCANNER CHECK ON IT?
WHAT KIND OF A BEAM?

212
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,963
PURE ANTIPROTON.

213
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:54,964
ABSOLUTELY PURE.

214
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,635

UNABLE TO RAISE

218
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,765

221
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,813
SHE WAS ATTACKED BY
WHAT APPEARS TO BE
ESSENTIALLY...

222
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,649
A ROBOT,

223
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:16,152
AN AUTOMATED WEAPON
OF IMMENSE SIZE AND POWER.

224
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,612
ITS APPARENT FUNCTION

225
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,323
IS TO SMASH PLANETS
TO RUBBLE

226
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,284
AND THEN DIGEST
THE DEBRIS FOR FUEL.

227
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,743
IT IS, THEREFORE,
SELF-SUSTAINING

228
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,079
AS LONG AS THERE
ARE PLANETARY BODIES

229
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,540
FOR IT TO FEED ON.

230
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:34,795
A ROBOT WEAPON
THAT PURPOSELY DESTROYS
ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEMS.

231
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,423

232
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,882
UNKNOWN, CAPTAIN.

233
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,720
HOWEVER, MR. SULU
HAS COMPUTED THE PATH
OF THE MACHINE,

234
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,265

AS A BASE COURSE.

235

PROJECTING BACK
ON OUR STAR CHARTS,

236
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,728
WE FIND THAT IT
CAME FROM OUTSIDE,

237
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,229
FROM ANOTHER GALAXY.

238
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,357
<i>WHAT IS THE PROJECTED</i>
<i>COURSE OF THIS THING?</i>

239
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,984

00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,570

242
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,408

244
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,956
STAND BY, MR. SPOCK.
KIRK OUT.

245
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,125

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,167
A ROBOT.

247
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,044
A MACHINE LIKE
THAT--WHO WOULD
BUILD IT?

248
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,837
WE DON'T KNOW.

249
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,839
AN ALIEN RACE,
APPARENTLY FROM
ANOTHER GALAXY.

250
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,092
BUT WHY?

251
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,388

252
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,475
DID YOU EVER HEAR
OF A DOOMSDAY MACHINE?

253
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,561
NO. I'M A DOCTOR,
NOT A MECHANIC.

254
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,271
IT'S A WEAPON

255
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,731
BUILT PRIMARILY
AS A BLUFF.

256
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,441
IT'S NEVER
MEANT TO BE USED.

257
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,776
SO STRONG, IT COULD DESTROY

258
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,402
BOTH SIDES IN A WAR.

259
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,612
SOMETHING LIKE

260
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,406
THE OLD H-BOMB
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

261
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,991
THAT'S WHAT
I THINK THIS IS...

262
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,578
A DOOMSDAY MACHINE

263
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,413

IN A WAR

264
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,749
UNCOUNTED YEARS AGO.

265
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,000
THEY DON'T EXIST ANYMORE,

266
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,210
BUT THE MACHINE

267
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,671
IS STILL DESTROYING.

268
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,756
OH, FORGET ABOUT
YOUR THEORIES!

269
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,716
THAT THING'S ON
THE WAY TO THE HEART
OF OUR GALAXY.

270
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,050
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO ABOUT IT?

271
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,552

WE'RE GONNA DO

272
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:05,762
IS GET YOU BACK

273
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,888
OH, NO. I STAY HERE.
I'M NOT LEAVING MY SHIP!

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,315
YOU GO BACK TO THE
<i>ENTERPRISE</i> WITH THE DOCTOR

278
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,734

279
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,572

00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,566
IT CAME UP ON
US FAST, CAPTAIN,

288
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,777
BUT WE SEEM ABLE
TO MAINTAIN OUR DISTANCE.

289
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,029
<i>WE'RE BLIND HERE.</i>
<i>WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?</i>

290
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,622
IT LOOKS VERY MUCH
LIKE COMMODORE DECKER'S
PLANET KILLER.

291
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,589
AND IT IS PURSUING US.

292
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,582
WE ARE MORE MANEUVERABLE,
BUT IT IS GAINING ON US.

293
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,419

OF TOTAL CONVERSION DRIVE.

WE CAN'T LET IT GO BEYOND US
TO THE NEXT SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,638

00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,117
WASHBURN,
YOU GET IN THERE.

346
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,747
LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
ABOUT THIS VIEWING SCREEN.

347
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,750
I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE.

348
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,345
NO CASUALTIES,
MR. SPOCK.

349
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,304
HOW ARE WE DOING?

350
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,932
WE HAVE OUTRUN IT,
DOCTOR.

351
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,558
STATUS REPORT.

352
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,769
IMPULSE AND WARP
ENGINES OPERATIVE,

353
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:27,189

AND COMMUNICATIONS
UNDER REPAIR.

354
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,150
RANDOM CHANCE SEEMS
TO HAVE OPERATED
IN OUR FAVOR.

355
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,070
IN PLAIN,
NONVULCAN ENGLISH--

356
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,780
WE'VE BEEN LUCKY.

357
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,323
I BELIEVE
I SAID THAT, DOCTOR.

358
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,869
IT'S VEERING OFF,

359
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,080
BACK ON COURSE FOR
THE NEXT SOLAR SYSTEM--

360
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,040
THE RIGEL COLONY, SIR.

361
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,670
EVIDENTLY PROGRAMMED
TO IGNORE ANYTHING

362
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,757
AS SMALL
AS A SHIP BEYOND
A CERTAIN RADIUS.

363
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,174
WE'LL MAINTAIN
A DISCREET DISTANCE

364
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,843
AND CIRCLE BACK TO
PICK UP THE CAPTAIN.

365
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,595
YOU CAN'T LET
THAT THING REACH RIGEL.

366
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,472
WHY, MILLIONS OF INNOCENT
PEOPLE WOULD DIE.

367
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,516
I'M AWARE OF THE RIGEL
SYSTEM'S POPULATION,
COMMODORE,

368
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,851
BUT WE ARE
ONLY ONE SHIP.

369
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,895
OUR DEFLECTOR SHIELDS
ARE STRAINED,

370
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,605
OUR SUBSPACE TRANSMITTER
IS USELESS.

371
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,524
LOGICALLY,
OUR PRIMARY DUTY
IS TO SURVIVE

372
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,276
IN ORDER TO WARN
STARFLEET COMMAND.

373
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,737
OUR PRIMARY DUTY
IS TO MAINTAIN LIFE

374
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,781
AND THE SAFETY OF
FEDERATION PLANETS.

375
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,157
DO YOU DENY THAT?

376
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,999
MR. SULU,

377
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,750
YOU WILL LAY IN
AN EVASIVE COURSE

378
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,127
BACK TO
THE<i> CONSTELLATION.</i>

379
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,086
AYE-AYE, SIR.

380
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,296
BELAY THAT
LAST ORDER, HELMSMAN.

381
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,342
180-DEGREE TURN,
HARD ABOUT.

382
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,802
WE'RE GOING TO ATTACK.

383
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,726
YOU WILL CARRY OUT
MY LAST ORDER,
MR. SULU.

384
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,191
MR. SPOCK,

385
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,360
I'M OFFICIALLY
NOTIFYING YOU

386
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,696
THAT I'M
EXERCISING MY OPTION

387
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,866
UNDER REGULATIONS
AS A STARFLEET COMMODORE

388
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,077
AND THAT I AM ASSUMING
COMMAND OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

389
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,371
YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO DO SO,

390
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,372
BUT I WOULD
ADVISE AGAINST IT.

391
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,624
THAT THING
MUST BE DESTROYED.

392
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,418
YOU TRIED TO DESTROY IT
ONCE BEFORE, COMMODORE.

393
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,295
THE RESULT
WAS A WRECKED SHIP

394
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,714
AND A DEAD CREW.

395
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,890
I MADE A MISTAKE THEN.
WE WERE TOO FAR AWAY.

396
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,100
THIS TIME I'M GOING TO
HIT IT WITH FULL PHASERS

397
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,977
AT POINTBLANK RANGE.

398
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,355
SENSORS SHOW
THE OBJECT'S HULL
IS SOLID NEUTRONIUM.

399
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,817
A SINGLE SHIP
CANNOT COMBAT IT.

400
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,319
MR. SPOCK,
THAT WILL BE ALL.

401
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,696
YOU HAVE BEEN
RELIEVED OF COMMAND.

402
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,115
DON'T FORCE ME
TO RELIEVE YOU
OF DUTY AS WELL.

403
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,961
YOU CAN'T LET HIM
DO THIS, SPOCK.

404
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,713
DOCTOR, YOU
ARE OUT OF LINE.

405
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,798
SO ARE YOU...

406
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,759
SIR.

407
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,094
WELL, SPOCK?

408
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,804
UNFORTUNATELY,
STARFLEET ORDER
104, SECTION B,

409
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,472
LEAVES ME
NO ALTERNATIVE.

410
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,141
PARAGRAPH 1-A
CLEARLY STATES--

411
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,517
TO BLAZES
WITH REGULATIONS!

412
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,229
YOU CAN'T LET HIM
TAKE COMMAND WHEN
YOU KNOW HE'S WRONG!

413
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,272
IF YOU CAN CERTIFY
COMMODORE DECKER

414
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,150
MEDICALLY OR
PSYCHOLOGICALLY
UNFIT FOR COMMAND,

415
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,819
I CAN RELIEVE HIM
UNDER SECTION C.

416
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,948
I'LL CERTIFY THAT
RIGHT NOW.

417
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,324
YOU'LL ALSO BE ASKED
TO PRODUCE
YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS

418
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,535
TO PROVE IT.

419
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,330
NOW, YOU KNOW
I HAVEN'T HAD TIME

420
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,793
TO RUN AN
EXAMINATION ON HIM.

421
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:37,588
THEN YOUR
STATEMENT WOULD NOT
BE CONSIDERED VALID.

422
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,261
YOU MAY LEAVE
THE BRIDGE, DOCTOR.

423
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,221
WHAT ABOUT THE CAPTAIN?
WE CAN'T LEAVE--

424
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,973
DOCTOR...

425
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,892
YOU MAY
LEAVE THE BRIDGE.

426

DO SOMETHING!

428
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:01,946
MR. SPOCK KNOWS HIS DUTY
UNDER REGULATIONS, DOCTOR.

429

00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,556

ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ONE MAN TO HANDLE.

517
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,840
WE HAVEN'T
GOT IT!

518
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,259
WE'RE BEING
PULLED INSIDE!

519
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,870
SCOTTY, GIVE ME
THAT POWER.

520
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,038
YOU'VE GOT IT, CAPTAIN--
JUST ENOUGH TO MOVE US.

521
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,373
I CAN'T DO BETTER.

522
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,749
THAT'LL DO.

523
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,838
FULL AHEAD,
MR. SCOTT!

524
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,049
[ENGINES WHINE]

525
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,692

526
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,582
THAT'S IT, MR. SCOTT.

527
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,791
KEEP THAT POWER COMING.

528
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,759
FULL POWER ASTERN.

529
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,302
AYE, SIR.

530
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,977
WE STILL
CAN'T MOVE.

531
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,113
KEEP POURING IT ON,
SCOTTY.

532
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,740
CAPTAIN,
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

533
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,491
WE'RE MOVING.

534
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,660
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> ISN'T.

535
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,370
MAYBE THAT THING
WILL SEE US

536
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,498
AND LET
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> GO.

537
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,291
IF I ONLY HAD
SOME PHASERS.

538
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,251
PHASERS?
YOU'VE GOT 'EM.

539
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,211
I HAVE ONE BANK
RECHARGED.

540
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,630
SCOTTY,

541
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,548
YOU'VE JUST EARNED
YOUR PAY
FOR THE WEEK.

542
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,342
STAND BY.

543
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,638
FIRE PHASERS.

544
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,851
WE'RE LOOSE,
COMMODORE.

545
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,145
GOOD BOY, JIM.

546
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,522
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,
WE'LL KILL THAT THING.

547
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,275
MR. SCOTT,
IT WORKED. GREAT.

548
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,699
I<i> THINK</i> IT'S GREAT.
SCOTTY, GET US OUT OF HERE.

549
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,867
IT'S CLOSING FAST
ON THE<i> CONSTELLATION.</i>

550
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,536
STANDING BY, SIR.

551
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:30,954
COMMODORE,
I SUGGEST--

552
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,372
KIRK PULLED US
OUT OF THERE
BY DISTRACTING IT.

553
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:36,126
NOW IT'S OUR TURN.
FIRE PHASERS.

554
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,049
WE DID IT!

555
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,636
HARD ABOUT.
GIVE ME SOME DISTANCE.

556
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,475
WE'RE MOVING AWAY,
COMMODORE.

557
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,601
THIS MACHINE
SEEMS TO HAVE

558
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,311
A PROGRAM-DEFENSIVE
SPHERE.

559
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,146
ANY ENERGY SOURCE
ENTERING THAT FIELD

560
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,272
IS SUBJECT TO ATTACK.

561
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,065
MR. SPOCK,
STATUS REPORT.

562
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,400
WARP DRIVE
AND DEFLECTORS

563
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,943
WILL BE OUT
FOR A SOLAR DAY.

564
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,363
REPAIRS PROCEEDING
ON TRANSPORTER
AND COMMUNICATIONS.

565
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,323
IT'S CLOSING WITH US
AGAIN, SIR.

566
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,908
MAINTAIN SPEED
AND DISTANCE.

567
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,870
IT'S SUCKING IN
SPACE RUBBLE FROM
THOSE DESTROYED PLANETS,

568
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:12,788
REFUELING ITSELF.

569
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,956
WE CAN MAINTAIN
THIS SPEED FOR ONLY
SEVEN HOURS

570
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,583
BEFORE WE EXHAUST
OUR FUEL,

571
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,670
BUT IT CAN REFUEL
ITSELF INDEFINITELY.

572
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:20,295
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO
FIGHT IT NOW,

573
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,255
BEFORE IT GETS
ANY STRONGER.

574
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,591
ILLOGICAL.
WE CANNOT DESTROY IT,

575
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,844
THEREFORE WE CANNOT
SAVE RIGEL.

576
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:30,514
WE MUST TRANSPORT
THE CAPTAIN AND THE OTHERS
FROM THE<i> CONSTELLATION</i>

577
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,141
AND ESCAPE THIS THING'S
SUBSPACE INTERFERENCE

578
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,018
IN ORDER TO WARN
STARFLEET COMMAND.

579
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:35,602
MR. SPOCK...

580
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:38,063
WE'VE PIERCED
THE INTERFERENCE
LOCALLY.

581
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,481
CAN YOU RAISE STARFLEET?

582
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,275
NO, SIR, BUT I'VE GOT
SHIP-TO-SHIP
COMMUNICATIONS BACK.

583
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,527
PICKING UP CAPTAIN KIRK.

584
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,738

<i>WHAT HAPPENED TO SPOCK?</i>

593
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,298
NOTHING. I ASSUMED
COMMAND ACCORDING
TO REGULATIONS,

594
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,092
<i>SINCE YOUR FIRST</i>
<i>OFFICER</i>

<i>WAS</i>
<i>RELUCTANT TO TAKE</i>

596
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:09,928
YOU MEAN YOU'RE THE
LUNATIC WHO'S RESPONSIBLE

597
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,971
FOR ALMOST
DESTROYING MY SHIP?

598
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,016
YOU ARE SPEAKING
TO A SENIOR

599
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,393
<i>GIVE ME SPOCK.</i>

600

YOU WILL SAY IT
TO ME.

604
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,235
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
I WANT TO SAY
TO YOU, COMMODORE--

605
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,238
GET MY SHIP
OUT OF THERE.

WE'LL EXHAUST

AND I WILL GIVE
THE ORDERS, CAPTAIN.

620
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,772
WE ARE GOING TO
TURN AND ATTACK.

<i>NOT WITH MY SHIP,</i>
<i>YOU DON'T.</i>

622
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,359
MR. SPOCK, RELIEVE

THAT'S A DIRECT ORDER.

MR. SPOCK, I ORDER YOU

YOU ARE RELIEVED

628
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:25,838
I DON'T RECOGNIZE
YOUR AUTHORITY
TO RELIEVE ME!

629
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,590
YOU MAY FILE
A FORMAL PROTEST
WITH STARFLEET COMMAND,

630
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,844
ASSUMING WE SURVIVE
TO REACH A STARBASE.

631
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,553
BUT YOU ARE RELIEVED.

632
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:40,686

OF THAT MACHINE,

687
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,150

TO TAKE THIS THING

688
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,237

689
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,993
THIS IS KIRK. MATT,
YOU'LL BE KILLED.

690
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,453
I'VE BEEN PREPARED
FOR DEATH

691
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,371
EVER SINCE I--

692
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,665
EVER SINCE
I KILLED MY CREW.

693
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,375
NO ONE EXPECTS YOU TO DIE
FOR AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT.

694
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,169

695
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,421
FOR THE LIVES
OF HIS CREW...

696
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,590
AND FOR THEIR DEATHS.

697
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,382
WELL...

698
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,760

699
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,303
YOU CANNOT SUCCEED,

YOUR ONLY LOGICAL
ALTERNATIVE

701

702

YOUR LIFE AWAY LIKE THIS.

705
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,328

A STARSHIP COMMANDER.

706
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,205

A VALUABLE COMMODITY.

00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,859
10...

859
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,445
9...

860
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,529
8...

861
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:04,905
7...
<i>MR. SCOTT?</i>

862
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,407
6...

863
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,408
TRY HER NOW,
MR. KYLE.

864
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,786
<i>5...4...</i>

865
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:28,304
[EXPLOSION]

866
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,315
BRIDGE!
WE GOT HIM THROUGH!

867
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,741
ENERGY OUTPUT...

868
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,785
ZERO.

869
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,037
RADIATION LEVEL
NORMAL.

870
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,428
WELCOME ABOARD, CAPTAIN.

871
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:15,892
SENSORS SHOW
ALL ENERGY SOURCES
DEACTIVATED.

872
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:18,604
IT'S QUITE DEAD.

873
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,938
MR. SULU...

874
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,607
EASE US BACK
TO MINIMUM HEADWAY.

875
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:23,192
CONSERVE POWER
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

876
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,611
LIEUTENANT PALMER,
TELL MR. SCOTT

877
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:29,323
TO EXPEDITE REPAIRS
ON THE WARP DRIVE.

878
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,367
POOR MATT.

879
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,203
HE GAVE HIS LIFE
IN AN ATTEMPT
TO SAVE OTHERS.

880
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,705
NOT THE WORST WAY
TO GO.

881
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,708
INDEED, CAPTAIN.
I PRESUME YOUR LOG
WILL SHOW

882
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,001
THAT COMMODORE DECKER
DIED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

883
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,420
INDEED IT SHALL,
MR. SPOCK.

884
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:45,423
IRONIC, ISN'T IT?
WAY BACK
IN THE 20th CENTURY,

885
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,008
THE H-BOMB WAS
THE ULTIMATE WEAPON--

886
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,886
THEIR DOOMSDAY MACHINE.

887
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,472
WE USED SOMETHING LIKE
IT TO DESTROY ANOTHER
DOOMSDAY MACHINE.

888
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,433
PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME

889
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:58,143
SUCH A WEAPON HAS
EVER BEEN USED FOR
CONSTRUCTIVE PURPOSES.

890
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,355
APPROPRIATE, CAPTAIN.

891
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,565
HOWEVER, I CAN'T HELP
WONDERING

892
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,317
IF THERE ARE ANY MORE
OF THOSE "WEAPONS"

893
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,903
WANDERING AROUND
THE UNIVERSE.

894
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,154
WELL, I CERTAINLY
HOPE NOT.

895
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,407
I FOUND ONE
QUITE SUFFICIENT.
