THE SECRECY?

11
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,905
THIS STAR SYSTEM'S UNDER
FEDERATION CONTROL.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,490
IT'S IN A BORDER AREA,
MR. SCOTT.

13

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,243
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,

15
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,996
IT'S NOT WORTH
FIGHTING ABOUT.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,372
WHY ARE WE HERE, CAPTAIN?

17
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,665
MY ORDERS ARE TO COOPERATE
WITH AMBASSADOR PETRI

18
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,584

00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,172
KIRK HERE.
WHAT IS IT?

22
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,508
CAPTAIN,
I HAVE A SIGNAL
FROM THE ELASIANS.

23
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,593
THEY'RE READY
TO BEAM ABOARD,

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,013
AND THEY DEMAND
AN EXPLANATION
FOR THE DELAY.

25
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,057
DEMAND? WHAT DELAY?
ALL RIGHT, BEAM THEM ABOARD.

26
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,142
SOUNDS TYPICAL
OF THE ELASIANS.

27
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,937
THE SCIENTISTS WHO MADE
THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION

28
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,356
REPORTED THE MEN
WERE VICIOUS AND ARROGANT.

29
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,441
OH, THAT'S JUST
THE NEGATIVE PART,
MR. SPOCK.

30
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,527
I'VE BEEN
OVER THOSE RECORDS.

31
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,655
NOW, THE WOMEN,
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL.

32
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,365
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE

33
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,951
A KIND OF SUBTLE,
MYSTICAL POWER

34
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,913
THAT DRIVES MEN WILD.

35
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,877
AMBASSADOR PETRI,
WOULD YOU DROP
ALL THIS NONSENSE

36
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,587
AND TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

37
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,672
THAT MUST WAIT UNTIL
THE DOHLMAN IS ABOARD.

38
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,132
THE DOHLMAN?
WHAT THE DEVIL'S A DOHLMAN?

39
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,928
THE THING MOST FEARED
AND HATED BY MY PEOPLE.

40
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:35,012

TO OUR QUARTERS.

76
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,790
WELL, NOW,
JUST A MOMENT.

77
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,458

TO HAVE TO BE

78
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,043
SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING--

79
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,212

84

MAY I HAVE
YOUR PERMISSION TO GO?

85
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,483

YOU TOLD ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

90
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,789

92
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,001
IS TO BE THE WIFE
OF OUR RULER--

93
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,211
TO BRING PEACE.

94
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,254
OUR TWO WARRING PLANETS

95
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,298
NOW POSSESS
THE CAPABILITY

96
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,257
OF MUTUAL DESTRUCTION.

97
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,843
SOME METHOD
OF COEXISTENCE

98
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,261
MUST BE FOUND.

99
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,679
I SEE.

100
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,139
SO WE GO BACK
TO TROYIUS.

101
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,100
YES. AH,
BUT SLOWLY, CAPTAIN.

102
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,519
I WILL NEED TIME.

103
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,728
BEFORE WE REACH THERE,

104
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,231
SHE MUST BE TAUGHT
CIVILIZED MANNERS.

105
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,066
IN HER
PRESENT CONDITION,

106
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,235
MY PEOPLE WOULD
NEVER ACCEPT HER.

107
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,197
AND YOU ARE TO BE
HER TEACHER?

108
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,406
THOSE ARE MY ORDERS.

109
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,534
I MUST ASK
YOU AND YOUR CREW

110
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,830
TO RESPECT,
OR AT LEAST TOLERATE
THEIR ARROGANCE.

111
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,082
FRICTION MUST BE KEPT
AT A MINIMUM.

112
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,293
YES,
THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND.

113
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,420
ANOTHER THING
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND,
CAPTAIN.

114
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,631
YOU HAVE AS MUCH
AT STAKE AS I HAVE.

115
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,800
YOUR SUPERIORS HAVE
MADE THE STATEMENT

116
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,844
THAT FAILURE
OF THIS MISSION

117
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,429
WOULD BE AS CATASTROPHIC
FOR FEDERATION PLANNING

118
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,016
AS IT WOULD BE
FOR OUR TWO PLANETS.

119
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,685
TO GAIN PEACE
AT THE PRICE

120
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,937
OF ACCEPTING
SUCH A QUEEN

121
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,482
IS NO VICTORY.

00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,820

THE OFFICIAL GIFTS
I BEAR.

124
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,532
PERHAPS THAT
WILL SOFTEN HER MOOD.

LAY IN A COURSE FOR TROYIUS.

126

127
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,213
SPEED FACTOR .037.

128
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,923

129
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,132
YES, THAT'S CORRECT,
MR. SULU.

130
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:08,803
SUBLIGHT FACTOR .037.

131
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:09,888
AYE, AYE, SIR.

132
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,431
CAPTAIN...

133
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:15,476
YOU'LL NOT BE USING
THE WARP DRIVE?

134
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,646
ALL THE WAY ON IMPULSE?

135
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,192
THAT'LL TAKE
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME.

136
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,777
YOU IN A HURRY,
MR. SCOTT?

137
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,113
NO.

138
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,200
CAPTAIN, THE DOHLMAN
IS DISSATISFIED

139
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,618
WITH THE QUARTERS
PROVIDED.

140
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,953
AH.

141
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,329
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THEM, MR. SPOCK?

142
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,580
I DO NOT KNOW,

143
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,292
BUT ALL THE ELASIANS
SEEM MOST IRRATIONAL.

144
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,876
I GAVE UP MY QUARTERS--

145
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,421
YES, I APPRECIATE
YOUR SACRIFICE,
LIEUTENANT UHURA.

146
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,464
I'LL TALK TO HER
MYSELF.

147
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,721
SWINE!
TAKE BACK YOUR GIFTS!

148
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,765

YOUR WEDDING SLIPPERS.

150
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,186

BUY THE FAVORS

151
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,021

OF ELAS.

152
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,066

YOUR WEDDING DRESS,

PRIZED OF ROYAL JEWELS,

156

FOR YOUR LOVELY NECK.

157
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,413
I WOULD STRANGLE
IF I WAS TO PUT THE GIFT

158
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,124
OF A TROYIAN DOG
AROUND MY NECK.

159

BY WHOSE PERMISSION
DID HE ENTER?

160
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,797
HE CAME IN ANSWER
TO YOUR SUMMONS.

161
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,426
I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
WITH YOUR QUARTERS.

162
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,052

164
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,973
YES, NOT HAPPY...AT ALL.

165
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,266
AM I A SOFT TROYIAN FAWN

166
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,810
TO NEED PILLOWS
TO SIT ON?

167
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,313
AND THESE RIDICULOUS
FEMALE TRAPPINGS.

168
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,815
THEY ARE AN OFFENSE
TO MY EYES.

GENEROUSLY
VACATED THE ROOMS

HOPING YOU WOULD
FIND THEM SATISFACTORY.

172

I DO NOT FIND THEM SO.

173
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,534
AND I FIND HIM
EVEN LESS SATISFACTORY.

177
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,626
I EXPLAINED
TO HER GLORY

178
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,170
THAT HER
COUNCIL OF NOBLES

179
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,505
AND THE
TROYIUS TRIBUNAL

180
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,549
JOINTLY AGREED THAT
I SHOULD INSTRUCT--

181
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,636
MAKE HER ACQUAINTED

182
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,223
WITH THE CUSTOMS AND
MANNERS OF OUR PEOPLE.

183
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,849
KRYTON!

184
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,393
REMOVE HIM!

185
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,981
AND TAKE THAT GARBAGE
WITH YOU!

186
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,832
HE DARES TO SUGGEST
THAT I ADOPT

187
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,793
THE SERVILE MANNERS
OF HIS PEOPLE!

188
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,339
YOUR GLORY DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE RESPONDING
TO INSTRUCTION.

189
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,217
I WILL NEVER
FORGIVE THE COUNCIL

190
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,677
FOR PUTTING ME
THROUGH THIS TORTURE.

191
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,640
WERE YOU RESPONDING
TO MY DEMAND

192
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,017
FOR BETTER QUARTERS?

193
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,143
THERE ARE NONE BETTER.

194
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,312
I SUGGEST YOU
MAKE DO WITH THESE.

195
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,813
YOU SUGGEST?!

196
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,524
THERE ARE
NO MORE AVAILABLE,

197
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,734
BUT IF THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN GET GRATIFICATION,

198
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,446
I'LL ARRANGE TO HAVE
THE WHOLE ROOM FILLED
FROM FLOOR TO CEILING

199
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,281
WITH BREAKABLE OBJECTS.

200
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,241
I WILL NOT
BE HUMILIATED!

201
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,161
THEN ACT IN
A CIVILIZED FASHION.

202
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,622
I DID NOT GIVE YOU
PERMISSION TO LEAVE!

203
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,293
I DIDN'T ASK FOR ANY.

204
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,463
OHH!

205
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,425
CAPTAIN, I WISH TO
CONTACT MY GOVERNMENT.

206
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,427
I CANNOT
FULFILL MY MISSION.

207
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,095
IT WOULD BE AN INSULT
TO OUR RULER

208
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,972
TO BRING THIS
INCORRIGIBLE MONSTER
AS A BRIDE!

209
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,848
AMBASSADOR!

210
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,893
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
A PEACEFUL MISSION.

211
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,521
THERE CANNOT BE PEACE
BETWEEN US.

212
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,607
WE HAVE
DELUDED OURSELVES.

213
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,442
CAPTAIN,
WHEN I AM NEAR THEM,

214
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,444
I DO NOT WANT PEACE,

215
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,695
I WANT TO KILL THEM!

216
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,948
YOU'RE AS BAD
AS SHE IS.

217
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,825
IT'S NOT REQUIRED
THAT YOU LIKE EACH OTHER.

218
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,868
JUST...DO YOUR JOB.

219
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,538
THE JOB?
THE JOB IS IMPOSSIBLE.

220
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,914
WE CANNOT MAKE PEACE

221
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,500
WITH PEOPLE WE DETEST.

222
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,293
STOP TRYING
TO KILL EACH OTHER!

223
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,378
THEN WORRY ABOUT
BEING FRIENDLY.

224
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,879
BUT IF SHE WON'T
LISTEN TO ME--

225
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,923
THEN MAKE HER LISTEN,
AMBASSADOR.

226
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,551
USE A DIFFERENT APPROACH.

227
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,885
STOP BEING SO DIPLOMATIC.

228
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:18,970
SHE RESPECTS STRENGTH.

229
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,139
GO IN STRONG.

230
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,984
AT FIRST IT APPEARED
TO BE A SENSOR GHOST,

231
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,820
BUT I'VE RUN CHECKS
ON ALL THE INSTRUMENTATION.

232
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,448
ALL THE EQUIPMENT
IS FUNCTIONING PERFECTLY.

233
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,866
HYDROGEN CLOUD
REFLECTION?

234
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,451
NONE IN THIS AREA.

235
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,702
NOTHING THAT WOULD
ACCOUNT FOR IT.

236
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,954
THE GHOST APPEARS
INTERMITTENTLY.

237
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,123
SPECULATION.

238
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,042
NONE, CAPTAIN.

239
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,085
INSUFFICIENT DATA.

240
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,254
IT'S NOT AN INSTRUMENT
MALFUNCTION.

241
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,508
IT'S NOT A REFLECTION
FROM A NATURAL
PHENOMENON.

242
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,509
A SPACE SHIP?

243
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,803
Scotty: ENGINEERING
TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

244
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,430
KIRK HERE.

245
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,723
CAPTAIN,
I KNOW WHAT YOU SAID

246
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,226
ABOUT SHOWING RESPECT,

247
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,727
BUT MUST I HAVE
THESE PERSONS

248
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,021
FOOL AROUND
WITH MY EQUIPMENT?

249
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,606
HANG ON, SCOTTY.

250
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,608
BE PLEASANT NO MATTER
HOW MUCH IT HURTS.

251
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,318
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

252
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,033
WE'RE ONLY RUNNING
ON IMPULSE ENGINES NOW.

253
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,619
ORDINARILY, WE USE
THE WARP ENGINES
EXCLUSIVELY.

254
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,497
WELL...I SUPPOSE, UH,

255
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:28,623
LASSIE...

256
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:32,085
THAT EVEN OUR IMPULSE
ENGINES MUST SEEM FAST

257
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,795
COMPARED TO YOUR
NUCLEAR PROPULSION UNITS.

258
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,381
WE ARE INTERESTED

259
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,426
IN HOW THE SHIP
IS USED IN COMBAT,

260
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,553
NOT IN WHAT DRIVES IT.

261
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:45,014
ENGINES ARE FOR MECHANICS
AND MENIALS.

262
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,434
MENIALS?

263
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,602
WITHOUT ENGINES,

264
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,437
THERE'D BE NO FIGHTING OR--

265
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,187
Kirk: MR. SCOTT.

266
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,440
I WISH YOU HAD TOLD ME

267
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,525
THAT YOU WANTED A TOUR OF
THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT.

268
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,528
DO WE NOT HAVE
THE FREEDOM OF THIS SHIP?

269
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,280
WE HAVE GRANTED YOUR CREW
THE PERMISSION

270
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,323
NOT TO KNEEL
IN OUR PRESENCE.

271
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,700
WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?

272
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,286
COURTESY. REMEMBER?

273
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,496
COURTESY IS NOT
FOR INFERIORS.

274
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,666
COURTESY IS FOR
EVERYONE AROUND HERE,

275
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,293
AND YOU'LL FIND
YOU WON'T BE ABLE

276
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,003
TO EXIST ON TROYIUS
WITHOUT IT.

277
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,214
MR. SCOTT,
OUR CHIEF ENGINEER,

278
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,674
HAS SHOWN YOU
HIS ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT.

279
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:25,012
THAT'S A COURTESY.
YOU RESPOND
BY SAYING THANK YOU.

280
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,267
[INTERCOM WHISTLES]

281
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,102
Spock: BRIDGE TO CAPTAIN.

282
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,982
KIRK HERE.

283
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,900
THAT SENSOR GHOST
IS MOVING CLOSER.

284
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,487
ON MY WAY.

285
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,741
LOST CONTACT NOW.

286
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,495
CAPTAIN, WE HAD A MOMENTARY
FIX ON THE OBJECT,

287
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,497
LONG ENOUGH TO ESTABLISH
IT WAS A SPACE SHIP.

288
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,498
WHOSE?

289
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,707
NO DATA YET.

290
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:53,792
Sulu: CAPTAIN.

291
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,917
DISTANT BEARING,
SIR.

292
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,462
MARK 73.5.

293
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,464
MAIN SCREEN.

294
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,549
EXTREME MAGNIFICATION.

295
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,185
HMM.

296
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,937
OUR GHOST
HAS MATERIALIZED.

297
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,606
A KLINGON WARSHIP.

298
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,706
ANY CHANGE,
MR. SPOCK?

299
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,207
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.

300
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,335
THE KLINGON SHIP
HAS SIMPLY MOVED
INTO CONTACT RANGE.

301
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,213
SHE IS PACING US,
PRECISELY MATCHING
OUR SUBLIGHT SPEED

302
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,007
AND ON A PARALLEL COURSE.

303
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,689
SECURITY TO CAPTAIN KIRK.

304
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,648
KIRK HERE.
WHAT IS IT?

305
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,025
DISTURBANCE IN
THE DOHLMAN'S QUARTERS, SIR.

306
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,152
ON MY WAY.

307
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,284
CAPTAIN,
IT'S AMBASSADOR PETRI.

308
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,329
THEY REFUSE TO EXPLAIN
WHAT'S HAPPENING, BUT...

309
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,291
HER GLORY
HAS NOT SUMMONED YOU.

310
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,756
KRYTON,
REMOVE THAT TROYIAN PIG.

311
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,445
IT WAS A DEEP WOUND, JIM.

312
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,615
HE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD,
BUT HE'LL RECOVER.

313
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,241
IF I RECOVER,

314
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,578
IT WILL BE NO THANKS
TO YOU, CAPTAIN.

315
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,623
I SAID TALK WITH HER,
NOT FIGHT WITH HER.

316
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:57,957
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER

317
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,000
THAN TO
TALK TO HER UNARMED,

318
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,670
BUT YOU FORCED ME.

319
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,172
I HOLD YOU
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

320
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,174
WELL, I'VE HEARD OF
RELUCTANT BRIDES,

321
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,093
BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

322
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,052
CAPTAIN KIRK.

323
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,096
MAY I SPEAK
WITH YOU, SIR?

324
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,264
YES, CERTAINLY.

325
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,892
A MESSAGE JUST CAME IN
FROM STARFLEET COMMAND.

326
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,102
IT WAS CLASS-A SECURITY
AND SCRAMBLED.

327
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,520
I PUT IT THROUGH
THE DECODER.

328
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,354
WHAT WAS IT?

329
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,815
THE FEDERATION
HIGH COMMISSIONER

330
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,023
IS ON HIS WAY
TO TROYIUS

331
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,400
TO ATTEND
THE ROYAL WEDDING.

332
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,610
AMBASSADOR,

333
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,612
IF ELASIAN WOMEN
ARE THAT VICIOUS,

334
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,657
WHY ARE MEN
SO OVERWHELMINGLY
ATTRACTED TO THEM?

335
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,576
I MEAN, WHAT MAGIC
DO THEY POSSESS?

336
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,994
IT'S NOT MAGIC.

337
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,497
IT'S BIOCHEMICAL.

338
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,958
A MAN WHOSE FLESH
IS ONCE TOUCHED

339
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,961
BY THE TEARS
OF A WOMAN OF ELAS

340
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,380
HAS HIS HEART
ENSLAVED FOREVER.

341
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,968
AMBASSADOR, THERE'S
AN ADDED COMPLICATION.

342
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,594
THE FEDERATION
HIGH COMMISSIONER

343
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,596
WILL BE ATTENDING
THE WEDDING.

344
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,598
OH, THE FAT
WILL BE IN THE FIRE

345
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,558
WHEN HE LEARNS THE BRIDE
JUST TRIED TO MURDER

346
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,977
THE GROOM'S AMBASSADOR.

347
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,479
THERE WILL BE
NO WEDDING.

348
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,649
I WOULD NOT HAVE OUR RULER
MARRY THAT MONSTER

349
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,653
IF THE ENTIRE GALAXY
DEPENDED ON IT.

350
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,531
AND I WILL HAVE NOTHING
FURTHER TO DO WITH YOU.

351
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,658
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

352
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:14,659
JUST DO YOUR JOB
WITH HER.

353
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,619
HOW LONG WILL IT BE
BEFORE HE'S ON HIS FEET?

354
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,956
IT'LL BE A FEW DAYS.
A WEEK, AT LEAST, JIM.

355
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,001
HERE YOU PUT ME,
CAPTAIN.

356
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,044
HERE I WILL STAY.

357
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,255
I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER
TO SAY TO YOU.

358
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,596
SO...

359
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,057
AMBASSADOR PETRI
IS GOING TO RECOVER?

360
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,352
THAT IS TOO BAD.

361
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,021
YOU HAVE DELIVERED
YOUR MESSAGE.

362
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,981
NOW YOU MAY GO.

363
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,941
NOTHING WOULD PLEASE
ME MORE, YOUR GLORY,

364
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,109
BUT YOUR
IMPETUOUS NATURE--

365
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,195
YOUR TROYIAN PIG
WAS HERE IN MY QUARTERS

366
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,989
WITHOUT ANY PERMISSION,

367
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,574
SO I STABBED HIM.

368
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,826
JUST TO BE TROYIAN
IS ENOUGH.

369
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,119
YOU ELASIANS
PRIDE YOURSELVES

370
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,330
ON BEING
A WARRIOR PEOPLE.

371
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,042
YOU MUST
UNDERSTAND DISCIPLINE,

372
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,044
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE
AND TAKE ORDERS.

373
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,171
NOW, MY ORDERS ARE
TO TAKE YOU TO TROYIUS

374
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,673
TO BE MARRIED

375
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,509
AND TO SEE TO IT
THAT YOU LEARN
TROYIAN CUSTOMS.

376
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,677
I DESPISE TROYIANS.

377
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,013
ANY CONTACT WITH THEM
MAKES ME FEEL SOILED.

378
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,639
IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE

379
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,475
THAT THE PREJUDICES
PEOPLE FEEL
ABOUT EACH OTHER

380
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,395
DISAPPEAR WHEN THEY
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

381
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,647
IT'S NOT IN MY EXPERIENCE.

382
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,946
WELL, WE'RE STILL FACED
WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.

383
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,281
PROBLEM?

384
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,825
YES, THE PROBLEM
OF YOUR INDOCTRINATION

385
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,452
TO TROYIAN CUSTOMS
AND MANNERS.

386
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,038
I HAVE ELIMINATED
THAT PROBLEM.

387
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,873
YOU HAVE ELIMINATED
THE TEACHER.

388
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,750
THE PROBLEM
STILL REMAINS.

389
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,835
OH.

390
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,797
AND HOW DO WE
SOLVE THE PROBLEM?

391
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,466
BY...

392
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,802
GIVING YOU
A NEW TEACHER.

393
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,512
[LAUGHS]

394
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,389
TELL ME,

395
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,849
WHAT CAN YOU
TEACH ME?

396
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,559
TABLE MANNERS,
FOR ONE THING.

397
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,561
THIS IS A PLATE.

398
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,521
IT CONTAINS FOOD.

399
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,148
THIS IS A KNIFE.

400
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,524
IT CUTS THE FOOD.

401
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,151
THIS IS A GLASS.

402
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,152
LEAVE ME!

403
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,528
LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN

404
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,656
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
ORDERED TO LEARN!

405
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,955
YOU WILL RETURN ME
TO ELAS IMMEDIATELY.

406
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,414
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

407
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,416
EVERYTHING I ORDER
IS POSSIBLE.

408
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,710
THAT'S THE FIRST PROBLEM
WE'RE GONNA WORK ON.

409
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,378
THEN WE'LL GET YOU
READY TO GO TO TROYIUS.

410
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,172
I WILL NOT
GO TO TROYIUS,

411
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,381
I WILL NOT BE MADE
INTO A TROYIAN,

412
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,467
AND I WILL NOT BE
HUMILIATED,

413
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,178
AND I WILL NOT BE GIVEN
TO A GREEN PIG

414
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,555
AS A BRIBE
TO STOP A WAR!

415
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,437
YOU ENJOY THE PRIVILEGES
AND PREROGATIVES

416
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,856
OF BEING A DOHLMAN.

417
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,192
THEN BE WORTHY OF THEM.

418
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,653
IF YOU DON'T
WANT THE OBLIGATIONS

419
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,155
THAT GO ALONG
WITH THE TITLE,

420
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,739
THEN GIVE IT UP.

421
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,449
NOBODY SPEAKS TO ME
THAT WAY.

422
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,118
THAT'S ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR PROBLEMS.

423
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,953
NOBODY'S TOLD YOU

424
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,496
THAT YOU'RE
AN UNCIVILIZED SAVAGE,

425
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,123
A VICIOUS CHILD
IN A WOMAN'S BODY,

426
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,583
AN ARROGANT MONSTER!

427
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,755
THAT'S NO WAY
TO TREAT SOMEONE

428
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,674
WHO'S TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

429
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,645
TOMORROW'S LESSON
WILL BE ON COURTESY.

HIS INTENTIONS.

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,002
AYE, SIR.

AAH!

WILL YOU TELL HER GLORY
THAT CAPTAIN KIRK

448
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,568
REQUESTS
THE HONOR OF A VISIT?

449
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,737
THE DOHLMAN HAS PROMISED
I'LL BE WHIPPED TO DEATH

450
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,157
IF I LET CAPTAIN KIRK
PASS THROUGH THAT DOOR.

451

TAKE THEM TO SECURITY HOLDING.

453
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,754
CAPTAIN, YOUR ANALYSIS
OF THE SITUATION
WAS FLAWLESS,

454
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,090
ANTICIPATING
THAT SHE WOULD
DENY YOU ADMITTANCE.

455
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,344
HOWEVER, THE LOGIC
BY WHICH YOU ARRIVED
AT YOUR CONCLUSION

456
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,511
ESCAPES ME.

457
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,472
MR. SPOCK, THE WOMEN
ON YOUR PLANET ARE LOGICAL.

458
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,350
THAT'S THE ONLY PLANET
IN THIS GALAXY

NOW, ARE YOU GOING
TO BEHAVE OR NOT?

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,162
THE PENALTY IS DEATH
FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

WE'RE NOT ON ELAS.

YOU ARE WARNED, CAPTAIN,
NEVER TO TOUCH ME AGAIN.

IF I TOUCH YOU AGAIN,
YOUR GLORY,

470
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,098
IT'LL BE TO ADMINISTER
AN ANCIENT EARTH CUSTOM

00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:00,510
TO FIRE OUR WEAPONS.

702
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,553
KIRK OUT.

703
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,890
ELAAN,
I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THE BRIDGE.

704
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,517
PLEASE, YOU MUST GO
TO SICK BAY.

705
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,227
YES, MY LOVE.

706
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:18,028
TEST NUMBER 24.
COLLADIUM TRIOXIDE
IN ALGOBARIUM SOLUTION.

707
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,656
RESULTS ALSO NEGATIVE.

708
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,409
DOCTOR, THERE IS
NO ANTIDOTE

709
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,579
TO THE POISON
OF ELASIAN TEARS.

710
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,455
THE MEN OF ELAS
HAVE TRIED
DESPERATELY

711
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,333
FOR CENTURIES
TO DISPEL ITS POWER.

712
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,003
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME, DOCTOR.

713
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,338
IT IS MY TIME
TO WASTE, AMBASSADOR.

714
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,341
DOCTOR...THE CAPTAIN
ASKED ME

715
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,844
TO COME HERE
FOR SAFETY.

716
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,097
SAFETY?

717
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:47,390
WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE

718
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:51,519
OF OUR CHANCES
FOR SURVIVAL, DOCTOR?

719
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:55,982
THAT IS THE CAPTAIN'S
RESPONSIBILITY, AMBASSADOR.

720
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,570
CAPTAIN, MESSAGE
FROM THE KLINGON SHIP.

721
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,865
THEY ARE ORDERING US
TO STAND BY FOR BOARDING
OR BE DESTROYED.

722
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,491
THEY DEMAND
AN IMMEDIATE REPLY.

723
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,869
THEY'RE TRYING
TO FORCE A FIGHT.

724
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,871
SCOTTY, WHAT'S
OUR ENERGY STATUS?

725
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,331
93% OF IMPULSE POWER, SIR.

726
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,625
WE CAN
STILL MANEUVER.

727
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,169
MANEUVER? AYE.

728
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,296
WE CAN WALLOW LIKE
A GARBAGE SCOW

729
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,257
AGAINST A WARP-DRIVEN
STARSHIP.

730
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,716
OUR SHIELDS WILL HOLD
FOR A FEW PASSES,

731
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,969
BUT WITHOUT THE MATTER/
ANTI-MATTER REACTOR,

732
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,637
WE'VE NO CHANCE.

733
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,723
CAPTAIN, CAN YOU NOT
CALL STARFLEET
ON THIS EMERGENCY?

734
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,225
AND LET THE KLINGONS
KNOW THEY SUCCEEDED

735
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,810
IN WIPING OUT
OUR WARP ENGINES?

736
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,311
HELP COULD NOT
POSSIBLY ARRIVE

737
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,521
BEFORE THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
WOULD BE DESTROYED.

738
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,608
NOW THAT WE
ARE ALL ABOUT TO DIE,

739
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,237
I ASK YOU ONCE AGAIN

740
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:45,323
TO ACCEPT THIS NECKLACE

741
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,033
AND TO WEAR IT

742
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,619
AS A TOKEN OF RESPECT

743
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:55,000
FOR THE DESPERATE WISHES
OF YOUR PEOPLE AND MINE

744
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,043
FOR PEACE.

745
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,676
THAT'S ALL YOU MEN
OF OTHER WORLDS
CAN SPEAK OF,

746
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,053
DUTY AND
RESPONSIBILITY.

747
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,805
WE'LL STALL FOR TIME.

748
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,516
PROCEED ON COURSE

749
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,893
AND HOPE THE KLINGONS
CAN BE BLUFFED,

750
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,271
OR THAT THEY'RE
NOT PREPARED
FOR A GENERAL WAR.

751
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,815
OPEN A HAILING FREQUENCY.

752
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,984

753
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,612
THIS IS CAPTAIN
JAMES KIRK

754
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,533
OF THE U.S.S.<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
ON FEDERATION BUSINESS.

755
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:29,784
OUR MISSION IS PEACEFUL,

756
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,955
BUT WE'RE NOT PREPARED
TO ACCEPT ANY INTERFERENCE.

I'D SAY OUR STRATEGY
WASN'T TOTALLY EFFECTIVE.

00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,142
CAPTAIN, THE KLINGON
SHIP IS CLOSING

761
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,061

764
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:04,777
SCOTTY, CAN YOU
GIVE ME PARTIAL POWER
ON THE PHASER BANKS?

765
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,030
NO, SIR,
NOT A CHANCE.

300,000 KILOMETERS.

767
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,000
I TOLD YOU
TO STAY IN SICK BAY.

768
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,420
I WANT TO DIE WITH YOU.

769
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,635
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DIE.

770
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,388
NOW GET OFF THE BRIDGE.

HE'S PASSED US.
ALL SHIELDS HELD.

774
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,398
MR. SULU, BRING HER
TO 143 MARK 2.

775
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,360
KEEP OUR FORWARD
SHIELDS TO HIM.

776
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,362
HERE HE COMES AGAIN, SIR.

777
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,322
STAY WITH THE CONTROLS.

778
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,742
KEEP OUR FORWARD
SHIELDS TO HIM.

779
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,499
BETTER THAN WARP 7.

780
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,210
HARD OVER, SULU.
BRING HER AROUND.

781
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,586
HE'S GOING
FOR OUR FLANK.

782
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,801
SULU!

783
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,178
SORRY, CAPTAIN.
SHE WON'T RESPOND
FAST ENOUGH ON IMPULSE.

784
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,222
HE'S PASSED US AGAIN.

785
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,182
DAMAGE TO NUMBER FOUR
SHIELD.

786
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,101
HOW BAD?

787
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:22,855
IT WILL NOT WITHSTAND
ANOTHER FULL CHARGE, CAPTAIN.

788
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,984
I'M GETTING SOME VERY
PECULIAR ENERGY READINGS.

789
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:29,237
HE'S PARALLELING US
AGAIN.

790
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,614
HE SEEMS TO HAVE
BROKEN OFF THE ATTACK.

791
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,660
WHAT SORT OF READINGS,
MR. SPOCK?

792
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,961
SHE IS THE SOURCE.

793
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,755

00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,600
THE NECKLACE.

795
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,521
WHAT KIND OF JEWELS
ARE IN THIS?

796
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,563
THEY CALL THEM
RADANS.

797
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,484
THE NECKLACE
IS SUPPOSED TO
BRING YOU LUCK.

798
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,068
IT IS
OF LITTLE VALUE.

799
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,862
THEY ARE
COMMON STONES.

800
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,574
THESE ARE COMMON STONES?

801
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,246
SEE, CAPTAIN?
HERE AND HERE.

802
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:21,622
COMMON STONES?

803
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,042
NOW I SEE WHY
THE KLINGONS ARE INTERESTED

804
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,084
IN THIS SYSTEM.

805
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,003
MAY I HAVE THIS?

806
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:30,215
IF I CAN BE OF
ANY HELP, OF COURSE.

807
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,716
YOU MAY HAVE
JUST SAVED OUR LIVES.

808
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:35,011
MR. SPOCK, DO YOU THINK
SCOTTY COULD MAKE USE

809
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,221
OF DILITHIUM CRYSTALS?

810
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,847
NO DOUBT, CAPTAIN.

811

00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:47,828
75.

875
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,288

876
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:50,747
60.

877
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,708
50.

878
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,791
FIRE
AT MINIMUM RANGE.

879
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,293
40.

880
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,752
SHE WON'T STEADY DOWN.

881
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,505
30.

882
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,264
WARP IN, SCOTTY.
FULL POWER TO SHIELDS.

883
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,772
WARP FACTOR 2.

884
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:20,528
LAY US A COURSE
148 MARK 3.

885
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:27,243
CHEKOV...

886
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,495
PHOTON TORPEDOES--
FIRE!

887
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:30,955
AYE, SIR.

888
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,089
DIRECT HIT AMIDSHIPS
BY PHOTON TORPEDO.

889
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,717
DAMAGE TO KLINGON
NUMBER THREE SHIELD.

890
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,260
NUMBER FOUR SHIELD
OBLITERATED.

891
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,762
LOSS OF MANEUVER POWER.

892
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,388
HE'S BADLY DAMAGED,
CAPTAIN.

893
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:51,142
CONTINUING AWAY
AT REDUCED SPEED.

894
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,936
SECURE FROM
GENERAL QUARTERS.

895
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,271
WELL DONE, MR. SULU.

896
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,315
SCOTTY.

897
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,400
BUT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND YOU.

898
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,278
YOU MEAN YOU WON'T PURSUE
AND FINISH HIM OFF?

899
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,820
NO.

900
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,824
MR. SULU, RESUME COURSE
FOR TROYIUS.

901
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,535
AYE, AYE, SIR.

902
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,111
YOU WILL NOT BEAM DOWN
FOR THE CEREMONY?

903
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,862
NO.

904
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,160
I WANT YOU
TO HAVE THIS

905
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:55,122
AS A PERSONAL
MEMENTO.

906
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,249
I HAVE LEARNED
THAT ON TROYIUS,

907
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,335
THEY DO NOT WEAR
SUCH THINGS.

908
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:05,508
REMEMBER ME.

909
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,720
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

910
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:11,222
NOR HAVE I.

911
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,057
I HAVE ONLY
RESPONSIBILITIES...

912
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:16,769
AND OBLIGATIONS.

913
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,316
GOOD-BYE.

914
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,528
GOOD-BYE.

915
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,333
ENERGIZE.

916
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,520
IT'S STABILIZED NOW.

917
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:04,066
SPOCK, I'VE ISOLATED
THE BIOCHEMICAL SUBSTANCE

918
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,735
OF THE ELASIAN TEARS.

919
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,403
IT'S A KIND OF INFECTION,

920
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,154
AND I THINK I FOUND
AN ANTIDOTE FOR IT.

921
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,406
YOU'RE TOO LATE, DOCTOR.

922
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,449
THE CAPTAIN HAS FOUND
HIS OWN ANTIDOTE.

923
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:12,658
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR VULCAN MIND?

924
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,786
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
I'VE WORKED ON THAT--

925
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:17,996
THE ANTIDOTE
TO A WOMAN OF ELAS,
DOCTOR, IS A STARSHIP.

926
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,331
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
INFECTED THE CAPTAIN

927
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,834
LONG BEFORE
THE DOHLMAN DID.

928
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,545
MR. SULU, PREPARE
TO TAKE US OUT OF ORBIT.

929
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,882
WELL, I DOUBT SERIOUSLY

930
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:31,510
IF THERE'S
ANY KIND OF AN ANTIDOTE
FOR THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

931
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:34,096
IN THIS PARTICULAR
INSTANCE, DOCTOR,

932
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,891
I AGREE WITH YOU.

933
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,975
AHEAD WARP FACTOR 2.
