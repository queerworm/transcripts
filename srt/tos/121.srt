00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,910
IT'LL CALM HER DOWN.
TRUST US.

183
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,163
YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY
TO BRING HER BACK.

184
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,582
WHAT KIND OF FATHER
ARE YOU?

185
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,792
IT'S LANDRU'S WILL.

186
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,587
WHAT ABOUT LANDRU?
WHO IS HE?

187
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,130
IT IS TRUE THEN.

188
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,591
YOU DID NOT ATTEND
THE FESTIVAL
LAST NIGHT.

189
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,510
NO.

190
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,970
THEN YOU'RE NOT
OF THE BODY.

191
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,223
YOU COULDN'T BE.

192
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,397
SHE'S ASLEEP.

193
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,525
ARE YOU...

194
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:20,365
ARE YOU ARCHONS?

195
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,284
WHAT IF WE ARE?

196
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,995
IT WAS SAID
MORE WOULD FOLLOW.

197
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,581
IF YOU ARE INDEED--

198
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,290
WE MUST HIDE THEM.
QUICKLY. THE LAWGIVERS.

199
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,585
WE CAN TAKE CARE
OF OURSELVES.

200
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,461
LANDRU WILL KNOW.
HE WILL COME.

201
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,842
HE IS THE ONE.

202
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,596
HE MOCKED THE LAWGIVERS.
I HEARD HIM.

203
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,681
NO, HACOM.
IT WAS A JEST.

204
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,391
THE OTHERS,
THEY WERE HERE,

205
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,309
BUT THEY SCORNED
THE FESTIVAL.

206
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,686
I SAW IT.

207
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,939
TAMAR, STAND CLEAR.

208
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,153
I HEAR...

209
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,408
AND OBEY THE VOICE
OF LANDRU.

210
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,634
YOU ATTACKED
THE BODY.

211
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:27,223
YOU HAVE
HEARD THE WORD
AND DISOBEYED.

212
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,267
YOU WILL BE
ABSORBED.

213
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,394
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
ABSORBED?

214
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,272
THERE. YOU SEE?
NOT OF THE BODY.

215
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:38,568
YOU WILL BE
ABSORBED.

216
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,028
THE GOOD IS ALL.

217
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,991
LANDRU
IS GENTLE.

218
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,535
YOU WILL COME.

219
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,713
WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

220
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,965
IT IS THE LAW.

221
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,801
YOU MUST COME.

222
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,303
I SAID WE'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

223
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,770
EVIDENTLY THEY'RE NOT
PREPARED TO DEAL

224
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,356
WITH OUTRIGHT DISOBEDIENCE.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

225
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,483
EVERYTHING WE'VE
SEEN HERE SO FAR

226
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,736
SEEMS
TO INDICATE SOME
SORT OF COMPULSIVE,

227
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,237
INVOLUNTARY STIMULUS
TO ACTION.

228
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,616
YOUR ANALYSIS SEEMS LOGICAL.

229
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,378
IT IS CLEAR
THAT YOU SIMPLY
DID NOT UNDERSTAND.

230
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,547
I WILL REPHRASE.

231
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,132
YOU ARE ORDERED
TO ACCOMPANY US

232
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,552
TO THE ABSORPTION
CHAMBERS.

233
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,350
WHY DID YOU KILL THAT MAN?

234
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,018
OUT OF ORDER.

235
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,355
YOU WILL OBEY.

236
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,274
IT IS THE WORD
OF LANDRU.

237
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,027
YOU TELL LANDRU

238
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,321
THAT WE'LL COME
IN OUR OWN TIME

239
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,032
AND THAT WE'LL SPEAK
TO HIM.

240
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,455
YOU CANNOT.

241
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:18,752
IT IS LANDRU.

242
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,044
LANDRU.

243
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,339
FASCINATING.

244
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,675
THIS IS MERELY
A HOLLOW TUBE, CAPTAIN.

245
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,387
NO MECHANISM.

246
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,182
THEY'RE COMMUNING.
WE HAVE TIME. COME WITH ME.

247
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,267
WHERE TO?

248
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,560
TO A PLACE I KNOW.
YOU'LL BE SAFE THERE.

249
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,271
BUT WE MUST HURRY.
LANDRU WILL COME.

250
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,340
QUITE A FESTIVAL
THEY HAD.

251
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,341
PEACE.

252
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,969
WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF ALL THIS?

253
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,763
TOTALLY ILLOGICAL.

254
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,222
YESTERDAY WITHOUT APPARENT
CAUSE OR REASON,

255
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,558
THEY WROUGHT TOTAL HAVOC,

256
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,226
YET TODAY, NOW--

257
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,645
NOW THEY'RE BACK
TO NORMAL.

258
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,941
MORNING, FRIENDS.

259
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,651
GOOD MORNING, BILAR.

260
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,235
YOUR DAUGHTER--
THAT'S THE MAN!

261
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,154
NO, IT WASN'T BILAR.
IT WAS LANDRU.

262
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,573
LET'S HURRY.
WE HAVEN'T MUCH TIME.

263
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,539
IT'S TOO LATE. LOOK.

264
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,543
WHAT IS IT?

265
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,923
LANDRU--
HE'S SUMMONING THE BODY.

266
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,801
TELEPATHY, CAPTAIN.

267
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,601
PHASERS ON STUN.

268
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,563
WHICH WAY, REGER?

269
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,941
PERHAPS THROUGH THERE,
BUT LANDRU...

270
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,317
WE'LL HANDLE LANDRU.

271
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,610
JUST GET US
OUT OF THIS.

272
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,083
I DON'T WANT
TO HURT THEM.
WARN THEM BACK.

273
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,336
THEY'RE IN THE BODY.
IT'S LANDRU.

274
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,381
PHASERS ON STUN,
WIDE FIELD. FIRE.

275
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,019
FIRE.

276
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,528
SECURITY.

277
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,612
CAPTAIN.

278
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,367
LIEUTENANT O'NEIL.
HE'S ONE OF OUR MEN.

279
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,703
NOT ANYMORE.
HE'S BEEN ABSORBED.

280
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,996
BRING HIM ALONG.

281
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,748
BUT I TELL YOU,
HE'S ONE OF THEM.

282
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,541
WHEN HE WAKES, LANDRU
WILL FIND US THROUGH HIM.

283
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,543
LEAVE HIM THERE.
HE'S OUR ENEMY.
HE'S BEEN ABSORBED.

284
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,293
CAPTAIN, NOW THAT WE'VE
GOT LIEUTENANT O'NEIL,

285
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,837
LET'S BEAM UP
OUT OF HERE.

286
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,923
WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO THE ARCHONS.

287
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,008
WHICH WAY?
BRING HIM ALONG.

288
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,380
PUT HIM OVER THERE.

289
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,716
A LIGHTING PANEL.

290
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,218
AMAZING
IN THIS CULTURE.

291
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,016
COMES FROM A TIME
BEFORE LANDRU.

292
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,310
BEFORE LANDRU?
HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT?

293
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,354
NOBODY KNOWS
POSITIVELY.

294
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,024
SOME SAY AS LONG AGO
AS 6,000 YEARS.

295
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,442
CAPTAIN, IT TOOK
A VERY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY

296
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,569
TO CONSTRUCT A DEVICE
LIKE THIS--

297
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,154
INCONSISTENT
WITH THIS ENVIRONMENT--

298
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,615
BUT NOT INCONSISTENT
WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN.
SECURITY.

299
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,121
THOSE STAFFS,
HOLLOW TUBES--

300
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,206
ANTENNAE, SOME SORT
OF BROADCAST POWER.

301
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,126
WHAT IS IT, MR. SPOCK?

302
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,128
MOSTLY STRONG
POWER GENERATIONS, CAPTAIN,

303
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,047
NEAR HERE, BUT RADIATING
IN ALL DIRECTIONS.

304
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,381
HE'LL BE COMING AROUND
SOON, CAPTAIN.

305
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,635
HE MUST NOT.
HE'S BEEN ABSORBED.

306
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,015
ABSORBED?

307
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,766
THE BODY ABSORBS
ITS ENEMIES.

308
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,392
IT ONLY KILLS
WHEN IT HAS TO.

309
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,561
WHEN THE FIRST
ARCHONS CAME,

310
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,229
THEY WERE FREE,
OUT OF CONTROL,

311
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,398
OPPOSING THE WILL
OF LANDRU.

312
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,317
MANY WERE KILLED,
MANY MORE WERE ABSORBED.

313
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,319
WHEN HE REGAINS
CONSCIOUSNESS,

314
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,113
LANDRU WILL FIND US
THROUGH HIM,

315
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,447
AND IF
THE OTHERS COME--

316
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,533
WHAT OTHERS?

317
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:04,162
THOSE LIKE YOU AND ME,
WHO RESIST LANDRU.

318
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,579
AN UNDERGROUND?

319
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,166
HOW ARE YOU ORGANIZED?

320
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,754
IN THREES--

321
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,255
MYSELF,

322
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,175
TAMAR, WHO'S DEAD NOW,

323
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,217
AND ONE OTHER.

324
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:18,968
WHO?

325
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,095
I DON'T KNOW.

326
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,223
TAMAR WAS MY CONTACT.

327
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,060
GIVE ME
A DECISION, CAPTAIN.
HE'S COMING OUT OF IT.

328
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,813
HE MUST NOT
REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS.

329
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,024
HE'LL DESTROY US ALL.
HE'S OF THE BODY.

330
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,029
GIVE HIM A SHOT.

331
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,322
KEEP HIM ASLEEP.

332
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,615
REGER...

333
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,163
I WANT SOME ANSWERS.

334
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,043
THIS UNDERGROUND--

335
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,961
IF LANDRU'S
SO POWERFUL,

336
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,337
HOW DO YOU SURVIVE?

337
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,339
I DON'T KNOW, CAPTAIN.

338
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,176
SOME OF US ESCAPED
THE DIRECTIVES.

339
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,553
NOT MANY, BUT A FEW.

340
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,931
IT WAS THAT WAY
WHEN THE FIRST ARCHONS CAME.

341
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,559
THE ARCHONS...
TELL ME ABOUT THEM.

342
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,561
THEY HAD INVADED THE BODY,

343
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,272
BUT THEY RESISTED
THE WILL OF LANDRU.

344
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:17,026
YOU SEE, LANDRU
HAD PULLED THEM DOWN
FROM THE SKIES.

345
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,319
PULLED THEM DOWN
FROM THE SKIES?
A STARSHIP?

346
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,531
MR. SPOCK, THOSE
POWER READINGS YOU
TOOK, ARE THEY...

347
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,576
POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DESTROY
A STARSHIP? AFFIRMATIVE.

348
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,998
KIRK TO ENTERPRISE,
COME IN.

349
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,416
CAPTAIN,
WE'RE UNDER ATTACK.

350
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,210
THERE ARE HEAT BEAMS
OF SOME KIND

351
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,962
COMING UP
FROM THE PLANET'S
SURFACE.

352
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,130
STATUS REPORT.

353
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,214
OUR SHIELDS
ARE HOLDING,

354
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,673
BUT THEY'RE TAKING
ALL OUR POWER.

355
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,801
IF WE TRY TO WARP
OUT OR EVEN MOVE
ON IMPULSE ENGINES,

356
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,469
WE'LL LOSE

00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,176
WHATEVER YOU MAY
CALL YOURSELVES,

540
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,804
YOU ARE IN FULFILLMENT
OF PROPHECY.

541
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,054
WE ASK YOUR HELP.

542
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,515
WHERE IS REGER?

543
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,391
HE WILL JOIN US.

544
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,019
HE IS IMMUNE
TO ABSORPTION.

545
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,562
HURRY.

546
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:43,897
WE HAVE NOT
MUCH TIME.

547
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,524
WHO IS LANDRU?

548
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,777
I CANNOT ANSWER
YOUR QUESTIONS NOW.

549
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,404
LANDRU, HE WILL HEAR.

550
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,200
HERE ARE YOUR WEAPONS.

551
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,744
YOU MAY NEED THEM.

552
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:04,209
BEHAVE AS YOU SAW
YOUR CAPTAIN BEHAVE.

553
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,628
IT IS DONE.

554
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,089
JOY BE WITH YOU.

555
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,635
PEACE AND
CONTENTMENT.

556
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,153
CAPTAIN--

557
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,908
PEACE AND TRANQUILITY
TO YOU.

558
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,994
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

559
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,579
QUITE ALL RIGHT.

560
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:41,997
BE CAREFUL
OF DR. McCOY.

561
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,832
I UNDERSTAND.

562
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:45,959
LANDRU.

563
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,378
I AM FORMULATING
A THEORY, CAPTAIN.

564
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,546
AND?

565
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,632
NOT HERE.
THE DOCTOR.

566
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:58,722
YOU SPEAK IN
STRANGE WHISPERS.

567
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:02,017
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
OF LANDRU.

568
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,770
JOY BE YOURS,

569
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,188
AND TRANQUILITY,
MY FRIEND.

570
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,733
AND PEACE
AND HARMONY.

571
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,777
ARE YOU
OF THE BODY?

572
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,195
THE BODY IS ONE.

573
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,574
BLESSED
BE THE BODY

574
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,577
AND HEALTH TO ALL
OF ITS PARTS.

575
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,537
MY FRIENDS...

576
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,586
WHAT IS YOUR THEORY,
MR. SPOCK?

577
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,838
THIS IS A SOULLESS
SOCIETY, CAPTAIN.

578
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,966
IT HAS NO SPIRIT,
NO SPARK.

579
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,009
ALL IS INDEED PEACE
AND TRANQUILITY--

580
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,471
THE PEACE OF THE FACTORY,
THE TRANQUILITY
OF THE MACHINE,

581
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,556
ALL PARTS
WORKING IN UNISON.

582
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,643
AND WHEN SOMETHING
UNEXPLAINED HAPPENS...

583
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,398
THEIR ROUTINE
IS DISRUPTED?

584
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,984
UNTIL NEW ORDERS
ARE RECEIVED.

585
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,359
THE QUESTION IS,

586
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,527
WHO GIVES
THOSE ORDERS?

587
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,071
LANDRU.

588
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,156
THERE IS NO LANDRU,
CAPTAIN,

589
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,491
NOT IN
THE HUMAN SENSE.

590
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,829
YOU'RE THINKING
THE SAME THING I AM.

591
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,247
MR. SPOCK,

592
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,959
THE PLUG MUST BE PULLED.

593
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,585
SIR?

594
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,420
LANDRU MUST DIE.

595
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:16,091
CAPTAIN,
OUR PRIME DIRECTIVE
OF NONINTERFERENCE.

596
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,636
THAT REFERS TO
A LIVING, GROWING CULTURE.

597
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,055
DO YOU THINK THIS ONE IS?

598
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,566
JOY TO YOU ALL,
FRIENDS.

599
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,402
IT IS THE GIFT
OF LANDRU.

600
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,206
I BROUGHT YOUR
SIGNALING DEVICES.

601
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,791
YOU MAY NEED THEM.

602
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,627
WHAT WE REALLY NEED
IS MORE INFORMATION
ABOUT LANDRU.

603
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,008
YOU SAID YOU WANTED US
TO HELP YOU.

604
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,384
PROPHECY SAYS--

605
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,761
NEVER MIND WHAT
THE PROPHECY SAYS.

606
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,847
IF YOU WANT
TO BE LIBERATED
FROM LANDRU,

607
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,224
WE'LL NEED
YOUR HELP.

608
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,767
CAPTAIN.

609
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,228
YOU'RE NOT OF THE BODY!

610
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,230
PEACE...
YOU'RE NOT!

611
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,565
TO YOU, FRIEND.

612
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,774
LAWGIVERS!

613
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,984
PEACE.

614
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,152
LAWGIVERS!

615
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,278
TRAITOR! TRAITORS!

616
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,573
TRAITORS!

617
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,116
DOC, I DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOU.

618
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,617
TRAITORS!

619
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,788
AW, DOC...

620
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,250
SPOCK.

621
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,472
ISN'T THAT
SOMEWHAT OLD-FASHIONED?

622
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,808
THE ROBES.

623
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,773
WHERE IS LANDRU?

624
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:55,982
NO. NO.

625
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,525
WHERE DO WE FIND HIM?

626
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,989
WE DO NOT SEE HIM.

627
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,160
WE HEAR HIM

628
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,955
IN THE HALL
OF AUDIENCES.

629
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,664
IN THIS BUILDING?

630
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,586
YES.

631
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,713
YOU'RE GOING TO
TAKE US THERE.

632
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,257
OH.

633
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,801
SPOCK, CALL THE ENTERPRISE.

634
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,970
OH!

635
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:28,014
SNAP OUT OF IT!

636
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,808
START ACTING LIKE MEN.

637
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,893
SPOCK TO ENTERPRISE.
STATUS REPORT.

638
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,021
MR. SPOCK, I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO REACH YOU.

639
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,273
REPORT, SCOTT.

640
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,775
THE ORBIT'S
STILL DECAYING.

641
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,359
GIVE IT SIX HOURS,
MORE OR LESS.

642
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,070
THOSE HEAT BEAMS
ARE STILL ON US.

643
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,696
YOU'VE GOT TO CUT
THEM OFF, MR. SPOCK,

644
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,073
OR WE'LL COOK,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

645
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,075
SCOTTY,
STAND BY.

646
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,119
WE'RE DOING
THE BEST WE CAN.

647
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,578
HOW'S MR. SULU?

648
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,581
HE'S PEACEFUL ENOUGH,
BUT HE WORRIES ME.

649
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,416
PUT A GUARD ON HIM.

650
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,960
ON SULU?

651
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,837
THAT'S AN ORDER.

652
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,588
WATCH HIM.

653
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,840
CAPTAIN OUT.

654
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,842
CAPTAIN.

655
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,013
ALL RIGHT.

656
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,015
ABOUT LANDRU.

657
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,601
WELL...THERE WAS WAR,

658
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,435
CONVULSIONS.

659
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,230
THE WORLD WAS
DESTROYING ITSELF.

660
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,191
LANDRU WAS OUR LEADER.

661
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,400
HE SAW THE TRUTH.

662
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,444
HE CHANGED THE WORLD.

663
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,113
HE TOOK US BACK,

664
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,365
BACK TO A SIMPLE TIME,

665
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,992
A TIME OF PEACE
AND TRANQUILITY.

666
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,077
WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIM?

667
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:34,080
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

668
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,209
HE IS HERE NOW.

669
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,627
HE SEES. HE HEARS.

670
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:45,217
WE HAVE DESTROYED
OURSELVES.

671
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,384
PLEASE...

672
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,345
NO MORE.

673
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,098
YOU SAID
YOU WANTED FREEDOM.

674
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,142
IT'S TIME YOU LEARNED THAT
FREEDOM IS NEVER A GIFT.

675
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,852
IT HAS TO BE EARNED.

676
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,520
COME ON.

677
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,147
WE'RE GOING TO
FIND LANDRU.

678
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,191
NO! NO!
I WAS WRONG!

679
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,775
I SUBMIT!

680
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,194
I BEAR MYSELF
TO THE WILL OF LANDRU!

681
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,029
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

682
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:06,905
NO! NO! GIVE US HELP!

683
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,200
HELP ME!

684
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,492
ALL RIGHT,

685
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,994
IT'S UP TO YOU.

686
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,787
TAKE US TO LANDRU.

687
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,887
THIS IS THE HALL
OF AUDIENCES.

688
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,722
OPEN IT.

689
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,891
BUT THIS IS LANDRU.

690
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,893
OPEN IT.

691
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,834
LANDRU SPEAKS HERE.

692
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,427
LANDRU!

693
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,431
LANDRU!

694
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,849
WE ARE THE ARCHONS!

695
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,395
WE ARE THE ARCHONS!
WE'VE COME TO SPEAK!

696
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,687
WE ARE
THE ARCHONS.

697
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,856
WE WANT TO
TALK TO YOU.

698
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,566
LANDRU!

699
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,152
HE COMES!

700
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,751
DESPITE MY EFFORTS
TO SAVE YOU,

701
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,586
YOU HAVE INVADED
THE BODY,

702
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,255
AND YOU ARE
CAUSING GREAT HARM.

703
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,466
WE HAVE NO INTENTION
OF CAUSING HARM.

704
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,219
OBLITERATION
IS NECESSARY.

705
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:56,764
THE INFECTION IS STRONG.

706
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,352
FOR THE GOOD
OF THE BODY,

707
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,854
YOU MUST DIE.

708
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,024
IT IS...

709
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,026
A GREAT SORROW.

710
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,486
WE DO NOT INTEND TO DIE.

711
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,155
ALL WHO SAW YOU,

712
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,033
ALL WHO KNOW
OF YOUR PRESENCE HERE

713
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:18,370
MUST BE EXCISED.

714
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:22,081
THE MEMORY OF THE BODY
WILL BE CLEANSED.

715
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,210
LISTEN TO ME.

716
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,794
USELESS, CAPTAIN.

717
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,838
A PROJECTION.

718
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,509
YES, MR. SPOCK.

719
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:37,430
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
AT THE PROJECTOR.

720
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,951
OF COURSE.

721
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,787
IT HAD TO BE.

722
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,878
LANDRU.

723
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,922
A MACHINE.

724
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:14,592
THIS WHOLE SOCIETY
IS A MACHINE'S CONCEPT
OF PERFECTION--

725
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,219
PEACE, HARMONY...

726
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,388
BUT NO SOUL.

727
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,307
I AM LANDRU.
YOU HAVE INTRUDED.

728
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:25,603
PULL OUT ITS PLUG,
MR. SPOCK.

729
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,570
YOUR DEVICES
HAVE BEEN NEUTRALIZED.

730
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,988
SO IT SHALL BE WITH YOU.

731
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,950
I AM LANDRU.

732
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:42,787
LANDRU DIED
6,000 YEARS AGO.

733
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,205
I AM LANDRU.

734
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,248
I AM HE.

735
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,584
ALL THAT HE WAS
I AM--

736
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,377
HIS EXPERIENCE,
HIS KNOWLEDGE.

737
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,337
BUT NOT
HIS WISDOM.

738
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:53,548
HE MAY HAVE
PROGRAMMED YOU,

739
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,759
BUT HE COULD NOT
HAVE GIVEN YOU
A SOUL.

740
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,344
YOU ARE
A MACHINE.

741
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,889
YOUR STATEMENT
IS IRRELEVANT.

742
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,808
YOU WILL...

743
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:04,976
BE...

744
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,603
OBLITERATED.

745
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,939
THE GOOD OF THE BODY
IS THE PRIME DIRECTIVE.

746
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,984
THE GOOD OF THE BODY, CAPTAIN.
THAT'S THE KEY.

747
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,530
YES.

748
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:25,913
WHAT IS THE GOOD?

749
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,791
I AM LANDRU.

750
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,543
LANDRU IS DEAD.
YOU ARE A MACHINE.

751
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,379
A QUESTION HAS
BEEN PUT TO YOU.
ANSWER IT.

752
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:40,011
THE GOOD IS
THE HARMONIOUS CONTINUATION

753
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,429
OF THE BODY.

754
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:45,391
THE GOOD IS
PEACE, TRANQUILITY.

755
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:48,603
THE GOOD OF THE BODY
IS THE DIRECTIVE.

756
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,813
THEN I PUT IT TO YOU

757
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,149
THAT YOU HAVE DISOBEYED
THE PRIME DIRECTIVE.

758
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,942
YOU ARE HARMFUL
TO THE BODY.

759
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,194
THE BODY IS.

760
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,988
IT EXISTS.
IT IS HEALTHY.

761
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,199
THE BODY IS DYING.

762
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,408
YOU...

763
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:03,159
ARE DESTROYING IT.

764
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,620
DO YOU ASK A QUESTION?

765
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,376
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE

766
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,169
TO DO JUSTICE TO
THE FULL POTENTIAL

767
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:14,753
OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL
OF THE BODY?

768
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,298
INSUFFICIENT DATA.

769
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,758
WITHOUT
FREEDOM OF CHOICE,

770
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,093
THERE IS
NO CREATIVITY.

771
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,054
WITHOUT CREATIVITY,

772
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,930
THERE IS NO LIFE.

773
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,807
THE BODY DIES.

774
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,767
THE FAULT IS YOURS.

775
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,603
ARE YOU AIDING
THE BODY,

776
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,063
OR ARE YOU
DESTROYING IT?

777
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,190
I AM NOT PROGRAMMED

778
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,858
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

779
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:36,942
LANDRU!

780
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,861
GUIDE US!

781
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,947
LANDRU!

782
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,575
NOT NECESSARY,
CAPTAIN.

783
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,950
THEY HAVE
NO GUIDANCE,

784
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,203
POSSIBLY FOR
THE FIRST TIME
IN THEIR LIVES.

785
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,084
LANDRU...

786
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,044
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

787
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,005
PEACE, ORDER,
AND TRANQUILITY

788
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,840
ARE MAINTAINED.

789
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,800
THE BODY LIVES,

790
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,263
BUT I RESERVE
CREATIVITY TO ME.

791
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:06,847
THEN THE BODY DIES.

792
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,850
CREATIVITY IS NECESSARY
FOR THE HEALTH OF THE BODY.

793
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,227
THIS...

794
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:11,936
IS...

795
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,730
IMPOSSIBLE!

796
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,856
IS THIS
TRULY LANDRU?

797
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,567
WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM

798
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,151
AFTER HE BUILT
AND PROGRAMMED

799
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,487
THIS MACHINE
6,000 YEARS AGO.

800
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,574
YOU MUST CREATE
THE GOOD.

801
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:25,991
THAT IS THE WILL
OF LANDRU,

802
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,410
NOTHING ELSE.

803
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:28,411
BUT THERE IS EVIL.

804
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,955
THEN THE EVIL
MUST BE DESTROYED.

805
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,374
THAT IS
THE PRIME DIRECTIVE,

806
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,419
AND YOU
ARE THE EVIL.

807
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:38,879
I THINK.

808
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,506
I LIVE.

809
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,550
YOU ARE THE EVIL.

810
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,385
THE EVIL
MUST BE DESTROYED.

811
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,345
FULFILL
THE PRIME DIRECTIVE.

812
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:47,513
YOU...
LANDRU, HELP ME!

813
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,181
ARE THE EVIL.

814
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:51,392
FULFILL
THE PRIME DIRECTIVE.

815
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,603
HELP ME! HELP ME!
HELP ME! HELP ME!

816
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:21,880
WELL, MARPLON,
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW.

817
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,424
I HOPE
YOU'RE UP TO IT.

818
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,050
YOU CAN GET RID
OF THOSE ROBES.

819
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,385
AND IF I WERE YOU,

820
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:29,555
I'D START LOOKING
FOR ANOTHER JOB.

821
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,641
KIRK TO ENTERPRISE.
COME IN.

822
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,810
CAPTAIN,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

823
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:34,435
WHAT ABOUT THE SHIP?

824
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,688
THE HEAT RAYS HAVE GONE,
CAPTAIN,

825
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:39,982
AND MR. SULU'S
BACK TO NORMAL.

826
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,651
RELIEVING YOU.

827
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,444
EXCELLENT, SCOTTY.

828
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,904
STAND BY TO BEAM UP
LANDING PARTY.

829
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,573
LET'S GO SEE HOW THE
OTHERS ARE DOING.

830
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,826
MARPLON
CAN FINISH UP HERE.

831
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:52,995
CAPTAIN'S LOG.

832
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,665
STARDATE 3158.7--

833
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,335
THE ENTERPRISE IS
PREPARING TO LEAVE BETA 3

834
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,086
IN STARSYSTEM C-111.

835
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,130
SOCIOLOGIST LINDSTROM

836
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,258
IS REMAINING BEHIND
WITH A PARTY OF EXPERTS

837
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,803
WHO WILL HELP RESTORE
THE PLANET'S CULTURE

838
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,388
TO A HUMAN FORM.

839
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:11,597
MARVELOUS.

840
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:12,765
WHAT?

841
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,809
THE LATE LANDRU,
CAPTAIN,

842
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,811
A MARVELOUS FEAT
OF ENGINEERING--

843
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,270
A COMPUTER CAPABLE
OF DIRECTING THE LIVES

844
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,147
OF MILLIONS
OF HUMAN BEINGS.

845
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,982
BUT ONLY A MACHINE,
MR. SPOCK.

846
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,401
THE ORIGINAL LANDRU
PROGRAMMED IT WITH
ALL HIS KNOWLEDGE,

847
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:25,778
BUT HE COULDN'T
GIVE IT HIS WISDOM,

848
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,572
HIS COMPASSION,
HIS UNDERSTANDING,

849
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:29,948
HIS SOUL, MR. SPOCK.

850
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,410
PREDICTABLY
METAPHYSICAL.

851
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:33,411
I PREFER THE CONCRETE,

852
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,747
THE GRASPABLE,
THE PROVABLE.

853
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,957
YOU WOULD MAKE
A SPLENDID COMPUTER,
MR. SPOCK.

854
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,626
THAT IS VERY KIND
OF YOU, CAPTAIN.

855
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,378
CAPTAIN...

856
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,422
MR. LINDSTROM
FROM THE SURFACE.

857
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:45,798
YES, LINDSTROM.

858
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,007
JUST WANTED
TO SAY GOODBYE, CAPTAIN.

859
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,718
HOW'S IT GOING?

860
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,052
COULDN'T BE BETTER.

861
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,513
ALREADY THIS MORNING, WE'VE HAD
HALF A DOZEN DOMESTIC QUARRELS

862
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,766
AND TWO GENUINE
KNOCK-DOWN DRAG-OUTS.

863
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:57,894
IT MAY NOT BE PARADISE,
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY HUMAN.

864
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,646
SOUNDS MOST PROMISING.
GOOD LUCK.

865
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:04,983
HOW OFTEN MANKIND
HAS WISHED FOR A WORLD

866
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,570
AS PEACEFUL AND SECURE

867
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,238
AS THE ONE
LANDRU PROVIDED.

868
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,408
YES.
AND WE NEVER GOT IT.

869
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,536
JUST LUCKY, I GUESS.
