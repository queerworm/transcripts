1
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,476
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT,
CAPTAIN.

2
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:21,730
THE SPACE DEBRIS COMES
FROM THE SURVEY VESSEL
<i>S.S. BEAGLE.</i>

3
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:24,274
MISSING
FOR SIX YEARS,
AND NOW THIS--

4
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,193
JUNK IN SPACE.

5
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,612
PORTIONS OF
THE ANTIMATTER NACELLES,

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,656
PERSONAL BELONGINGS...

7
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,033
CAPTAIN, NO SIGNS
OF BODIES WHATSOEVER.

8
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,035
THEN WHATEVER
DESTROYED THE SHIP,

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,163
THE CREW WAS ABLE
TO GET OFF SAFELY.

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,958
NAVIGATOR, COMPUTE
THE PRESENT DRIFT
OF THE WRECKAGE.

11
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,168
COMPUTED AND ON
THE BOARD, SIR.

12
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,754
MR. SPOCK, ASSUMING THAT
THE WRECKAGE DRIFTED

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,175
AT THE SAME SPEED
AND DIRECTION FOR
THE PAST SIX YEARS...

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,178
IT WOULD HAVE COME
FROM PLANET 4,

15
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,181
STAR SYSTEM 892,
DIRECTLY AHEAD.

16
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,475
ONLY 1/16 PARSEC AWAY,
CAPTAIN.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,061
WE SHOULD BE THERE
IN SECONDS.

18
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,980
STANDARD ORBIT
AROUND THE PLANET.

19
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,940
THERE MAY BE
SURVIVORS THERE.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,525
<i>S.S. BEAGLE--</i>

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,277
SMALL CLASS FOUR
STARDRIVE VESSEL,

22
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,907
CREW OF 47,
COMMANDED BY...

23
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,493
JIM, I BELIEVE
YOU KNEW HIM.

24
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,203
CAPTAIN R.M. MERIK.

25
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,164
YES, AT THE ACADEMY.

26
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,167
HE WAS DROPPED
IN HIS FIFTH YEAR.

27
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,460
HE WENT INTO THE
MERCHANT SERVICE.

28
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,463
COMING UP
ON THE PLANET, CAPTAIN.

29
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,549
PUT IT ON
THE SCREEN.

30
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,094
DEFINITELY
CLASS "M."

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,014
SOMEWHAT SIMILAR
TO EARTH.

32
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,849
YES, SIMILAR,

33
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,476
BUT THE LAND MASSES
AND OCEANS

34
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,853
ARE QUITE DIFFERENT,
HOWEVER.

35
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,688
DIFFERENT IN SHAPE
ONLY, CAPTAIN.

36
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,648
THE PROPORTION
OF LAND TO WATER

37
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:47,858
IS EXACTLY
AS ON OUR EARTH.

38
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:51,653
DENSITY 5.5,
DIAMETER 7,917
AT THE EQUATOR.

39
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,282
ATMOSPHERE
IS 78% NITROGEN,
21% OXYGEN.

40
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,576
AGAIN,
EXACTLY LIKE EARTH.

41
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,621
EXACTLY IN SOME WAYS,
DIFFERENT IN OTHERS.

42
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,665
I ALSO PICKED UP
INDICATIONS OF LARGE CITIES.

43
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:04,875
WHAT ERA?

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,501
NO SIGN OF ATOMIC POWER
AS YET,

45
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,088
BUT FAR ENOUGH ALONG
FOR RADIO COMMUNICATIONS,

46
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,257
POWER TRANSPORTATION,
AN EXCELLENT ROAD SYSTEM.

47
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,594
CAPTAIN, BOTH AMPLITUDE
AND FREQUENCY MODULATION
BEING USED.

48
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,598
I THINK I CAN PICK UP
SOMETHING VISUAL.

49
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,224
IT'S A NEWS BROADCAST

50
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,061
USING A SYSTEM I THINK
THEY ONCE CALLED VIDEO.

51
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,064
TELEVISION
WAS THE COLLOQUIAL TERM.

52
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,149
PUT IT ON THE SCREEN.

53
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,651
RIGHT.

54
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,614

00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,874
SLAVES AND GLADIATORS.

77
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:30,585
WHAT ARE WE SEEING,
A 20th-CENTURY ROME?

78
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:34,255
CAPTAIN, THE ONE
DESCRIBED AS THE BARBARIAN

79
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,423
IS ALSO LISTED HERE.

80
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,676
FLIGHT OFFICER
WILLIAM B. HARRISON

81
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,095

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,472

READY THE TRANSPORTER
ROOM, MR. SPOCK.

84
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,395

00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,592

93
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,472
YOU COULD HAVE SELECTED
A MORE CONVENIENT PLACE,
MR. SPOCK.

94
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,224
BUT HARDLY MORE
PRACTICAL, CAPTAIN.

95
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,476
CLOSE TO THE CITY
WE LOCATED,
BUT NOT POPULATED.

96
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,311
WE SHOULD NOT
BE OBSERVED.

97
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,550
FASCINATING.

98
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,053
THIS ATMOSPHERE
IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR

99
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,429
TO YOUR 20th CENTURY.

CONTAINING SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS
OF CARBON MONOXIDE

102
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,314
AND PARTIALLY CONSUMED
HYDROCARBONS.

103
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,940
THE WORD WAS SMOG.

104
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,901
YES, I BELIEVE
THAT WAS THE TERM.

105
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,155
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE THAT MUCH
OF A HISTORIAN, DOCTOR.

106
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,698
I AM NOT, MR. SPOCK.

107
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,033
I WAS SIMPLY
TRYING TO STOP YOU

108
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,161
FROM GIVING US
A WHOLE LECTURE
ON THE SUBJECT.

109
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,329
JIM, IS THERE
ANYTHING AT ALL

110
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,830
WE KNOW ABOUT
THIS PLANET?

111
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,665
THE<i> S.S. BEAGLE</i>
WAS THE FIRST SHIP

112
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,584
TO MAKE A SURVEY
OF THE STAR SECTOR
WHEN IT DISAPPEARED.

113
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,461
THEN THE PRIME DIRECTIVE
IS IN FULL FORCE, CAPTAIN?

114
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,630
NO IDENTIFICATION
OF SELF OR MISSION.

115
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,300
NO INTERFERENCE WITH
THE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT
OF SAID PLANET.

116
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,509
NO REFERENCES TO SPACE

117
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,053
OR THE FACT THAT
THERE ARE OTHER WORLDS,

118
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,554
OR MORE
ADVANCED CIVILIZATIONS.

119
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,596
LET'S GO.

120
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,733
ONCE, JUST ONCE,
I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE
TO LAND SOMEPLACE

121
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:44,238
AND SAY,
"BEHOLD, I AM THE
ARCHANGEL GABRIEL."

122
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,614
I FAIL TO SEE
THE HUMOR IN THAT
SITUATION, DOCTOR.

123
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,490
NATURALLY.

124
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,450
YOU COULD HARDLY
CLAIM TO BE AN ANGEL

125
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,286
WITH THOSE
POINTED EARS,
MR. SPOCK,

126
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,248
BUT SAY YOU
LANDED SOMEPLACE

00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,514
I THINK HE MEANS IT,
SPOCK.

134
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,351
THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE
EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT.

135
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,998
WHO ARE YOU?

136
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,500

I CALL THEM EARS.

00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,060

00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,908
HAVE YOU HEARD
OF SUCH MEN?

174
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,161
SEPTIMUS, I KNOW
KILLING IS EVIL,

175
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,704
BUT SOMETIMES
IT'S NECESSARY.

176
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,373
NO.

177
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,790
BUT THEY'VE LOCATED US,
OUR HIDING PLACE.

178
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,585
IT'S BETTER
TO KILL A FEW OF THEM
THAN ALL OF US.

179
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,088
WAIT.

180
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,257
I CAN PROVE
WE'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.

181
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,592
A SMALL DEVICE.

182
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,553
I'LL TAKE IT OUT
SLOWLY.

183
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,848
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

184
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,100
COME IN.

185
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,684
<i>SCOTT HERE, CAPTAIN.</i>

186
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,230
SCOTTY, LOCK IN ON
MY TRANSMISSION BEAM.

187
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:05,980
SCAN US.

188
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,648
<i>SCANNING, SIR.</i>

189
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,402
INCLUDING OURSELVES,
HOW MANY OF US ARE THERE?

190
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,820
<i>12, CAPTAIN.</i>
GOOD, SCOTTY.

191
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,531
CONTINUE SCANNING.

192
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,242
WE'LL MAINTAIN TRANSMISSION.
KIRK OUT.

193
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,994
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i>
IS OUR SHIP,

194
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,371
SOMEWHERE AT SEA.

195
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,083
THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU.

196
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,751
IF IT ISN'T SUFFICIENT,

197
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,004
YOU WILL HAVE TO KILL US.

198
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,179
TELL ME THE EMPIRE
HAS A DEVICE
LIKE THAT, FLAVIUS,

199
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,764
AND YOU MAY KILL THEM.

200
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,893
OTHERWISE, ACCEPT THEM
AS FRIENDS.

201

NO, CAPTAIN.

217
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,357
I'M SURE I WOULD
HAVE HEARD

218
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,359
OF THE ARRIVAL
OF OTHER MEN
LIKE YOU.

219
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,487
PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD,
LET'S SAY,

220
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,990
AN IMPOSSIBLE STORY
OR A RUMOR...

221
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,036
OF MEN WHO CAME
FROM THE SKY OR...

222
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,829
FROM OTHER WORLDS.

223
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,498
THERE ARE
NO OTHER WORLDS.

224
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:47,374
THE STARS.

225
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,418
LIGHTS SHINING THROUGH
FROM HEAVEN.

226
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,129
IT'S WHERE THE SUN IS.

227
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,590
BLESSED BE THE SUN.

228
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,635
YES, OF COURSE.

229
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,808
CAPTAIN, I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT FIND THIS
INTERESTING.

230
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,150
SPOCK?

231
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,694
FASCINATING.

232
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,862
THE JUPITER 8.

233
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,822
CONVENTIONAL INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINE.

234
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,324
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE SMOG.

235
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,159
BUT THE JUPITER 8?

236
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,078
MARS TOOTHPASTE.

237
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,956
NEPTUNE BATH SALTS.

238
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,876
TAKEN FROM THE NAMES
OF FALSE GODS.

239
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,336
WHEN I WAS
A SENATOR,

240
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,462
I WORSHIPED THEM,
TOO,

241
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,048
BUT I HEARD THE
WORDS OF THE SUN.

242
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,757
I BECAME A BROTHER.

243
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,886
FOR THAT, THEY
MADE ME A SLAVE.

244
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,597
SEPTIMUS,

245
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,266
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

246
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,643
WE MUST GO
INTO THE CITY.

247
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,186
WE KNOW THAT ONE
OF OUR MISSING FRIENDS

248
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,938
WAS SEEN THERE RECENTLY.

249
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,523
MY ADVICE TO YOU
IS TO LEAVE.

250
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,400
GO BACK WHERE
YOU CAME FROM.

251
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,111
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

252
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,615
PERHAPS YOU KNOW HIS NAME--
MERIK. CAPTAIN MERIK.

253
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,159
MERIKUS?

254
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,626
YES. HE'S THE LEADER
OF OUR FRIENDS.

255
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,835
MERIKUS IS
FIRST CITIZEN.

256
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,421
BUTCHER.

257
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,589
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE
THE SAME MAN.

258
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,718
CAPTAIN, A LOGICAL
QUESTION, IF I MAY.

259
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,970
SEPTIMUS,
HOW MANY YEARS AGO

260
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,055
DID MERIKUS BECOME
YOUR FIRST CITIZEN?

261
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,974
PERHAPS FIVE YEARS.

262
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,684
ALMOST SIX.

263
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:33,146
I WAS THERE WHEN
HE BECAME LORD
OF THE GAMES.

264
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,231
IF HE IS
YOUR FRIEND,

265
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,443
YOU ARE NO
FRIENDS OF OURS.

266
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,990
SEPTIMUS, WHEREVER
WE MAY BE FROM,

267
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,785
YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT
IT IS ONE OF OUR MOST
IMPORTANT LAWS

268
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:51,331
THAT NONE OF US
INTERFERE WITH
THE AFFAIRS OF OTHERS.

269
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,208
IF CAPTAIN MERIK IS MERIKUS,

270
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,335
THEN HE HAS VIOLATED
THAT LAW,

271
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,378
AND HE MUST BE
TAKEN AWAY AND PUNISHED.

272
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,590
WILL YOU HELP US
TO GET TO THE TRUTH
OF ALL THIS?

273
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,599
FIRST I MUST DISCUSS IT
WITH THE OTHERS.

274
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:22,529
CURIOUS, CAPTAIN,
THE SIMILARITY IN NAMES.

275
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,196
WERE YOU TOLD
WHY MERIK WAS DROPPED

276
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,031
FROM THE SPACE ACADEMY?

277
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,825
HE FAILED
A PSYCHO-SIMULATOR TEST.

278
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,828
ALL IT TAKES IS
A SPLIT SECOND
OF INDECISION.

279
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,830
HARDLY THE TYPE TO BE
A POLITICAL STRONGMAN.

280
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,624
ODD THAT THESE PEOPLE
SHOULD WORSHIP THE SUN.

281
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,042
WHY, DOCTOR?

282
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,877
BECAUSE,
MY DEAR MR. SPOCK,

283
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,462
IT IS ILLOGICAL.

284
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,589
ROME HAD NO
SUN WORSHIPERS.

285
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,259
WHY SHOULD THEY
PARALLEL ROME
IN EVERY WAY EXCEPT ONE?

286
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,181
WE HAVE DECIDED.

287
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,225
FLAVIUS
WILL GUIDE YOU.

288
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,267
WE WILL
PROVIDE YOU

289
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,269
WITH SUITABLE
CLOTHING.

290
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,646
I CAUTION YOU,

291
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,231
TAKE GREAT CARE.

292
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,400
THE POLICE
ARE EVERYWHERE.

293
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:05,071
MAY THE BLESSINGS
OF THE SUN
BE UPON YOU.

294
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,300
WE'LL WAIT HERE
UNTIL DARK.

295
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,305
WERE YOU A SLAVE,
FLAVIUS?

296
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,850
YOU ARE BARBARIANS,
INDEED,

297
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,604
NOT TO KNOW
OF FLAVIUS MAXIMUS.

298
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:38,855
FOR SEVEN YEARS,

299
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:43,150
I WAS THE MOST
SUCCESSFUL GLADIATOR
IN THIS PROVINCE.

300
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,528
THEN YOU HEARD
THE WORD OF THE SUN?

301
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,449
YES.

302
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:53,411
THE WORDS OF PEACE
AND FREEDOM.

303
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,831
IT WASN'T EASY
FOR ME TO BELIEVE.

304
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,999
I WAS TRAINED
TO FIGHT.

305
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,586
BUT THE WORDS...

306
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,546
THE WORDS ARE TRUE.

307
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,299
THERE ARE MANY THINGS
I'D LIKE TO KNOW--

308
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,259
HOLD!

309
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,886
DON'T MOVE!

310
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,721
HANDS IN THE AIR!

311
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,203
FOUR FLEEING FISH.

312
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,456
A FINE HAUL.

313
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,709
FLAVIUS MAXIMUS.

314
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,383
YOU HAVE BEEN TOO LONG
ABSENT FROM THE GAMES,
FLAVIUS.

315
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,971
THE FIRST CITIZEN
WILL BE PLEASED.

316
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,936
RUNAWAY SLAVES
ARE ALWAYS WELCOME.

317
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,067
NO, NOT SLAVES.

318
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,402
BARBARIANS.

319
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,321
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

320
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,783
SINCE I'VE WATCHED
BARBARIANS DIE
IN THE ARENA.

321
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:24,002
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 4040.9.</i>

322
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,629
<i>UNIFORMED POLICE</i>
<i>LIKE THOSE OF EARTH;</i>

323
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,799
<i>A GREAT CITY, LIKE ROME,</i>
<i>WITH AUTOMOBILES;</i>

324
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,719
<i>ASTONISHING SIMILARITIES</i>
<i>TO 20th-CENTURY EARTH,</i>

325
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:37,015
<i>DOWN TO THE FINE CARBON STEEL</i>
<i>IN THE BARS.</i>

326
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,695
TELL MERIKUS
I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM.

327
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,779
THE FIRST CITIZEN?

328
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,407
WHY WOULD HE BOTHER
WITH ARENA BAIT
LIKE YOU?

329
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,869
TELL HIM IT'S JIM KIRK,
PERHAPS A FRIEND.

330
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,161
PERHAPS?

331
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,832
WELL, IF I AM A FRIEND
AND YOU DON'T TELL HIM,

332
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,459
DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO RISK THAT?

333
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,773
BUT IF THERE
HAVE BEEN SLAVES
FOR OVER 2,000 YEARS,

334
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:30,276
HASN'T THERE ALWAYS BEEN
DISCONTENT, RUNAWAYS?

335
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,361
LONG AGO, THERE
WERE REBELLIONS,

336
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,821
BUT THEY WERE SUPPRESSED.

337
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,032
AND WITH EACH CENTURY,

338
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,952
THE SLAVES ACQUIRED
MORE RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW.

339
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,871
THEY RECEIVED RIGHTS
TO MEDICINE,

340
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:46,000
THE RIGHT TO GOVERNMENT
PAYMENTS IN THEIR OLD AGE,

341
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,296
AND THEY SLOWLY LEARNED
TO BE CONTENT.

342
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,547
EVEN MORE FASCINATING.

343
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,884
SLAVERY EVOLVING
INTO AN INSTITUTION

344
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,761
WITH GUARANTEED
MEDICAL PAYMENTS,

345
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,137
OLD-AGE PENSIONS.

346
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,806
QUITE LOGICAL,
I'D SAY, MR. SPOCK,

347
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,682
JUST AS IT'S LOGICAL

348
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,978
THAT
A 20th-CENTURY ROME
WOULD USE TELEVISION

349
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,729
TO SHOW ITS
GLADIATOR CONTESTS

350
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,983
OR NAME A NEW CAR
THE JUPITER 8.

351
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,401
DOCTOR, IF I WERE ABLE
TO SHOW EMOTION,

352
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,029
YOUR NEW INFATUATION
WITH THAT TERM

353
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,781
WOULD BEGIN TO ANNOY ME.

354
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,116
WHAT TERM?

355
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,826
LOGIC?

356
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:23,203
MEDICAL MEN ARE TRAINED
IN LOGIC, MR. SPOCK.

357
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,957
REALLY, DOCTOR,
I HAD NO IDEA
THEY WERE TRAINED.

358
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,127
WATCHING YOU,
I ASSUMED IT WAS
TRIAL AND ERROR.

359
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,294
ARE THEY ENEMIES,
CAPTAIN?

360
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,506
I'M NOT SURE
THEY'RE SURE.

361
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:38,260
WHEN THE SLAVES BEGAN
TO WORSHIP THE SUN,

362
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,180
THEY BECAME DISCONTENT AGAIN.

363
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,598
WHEN DID
ALL THIS HAPPEN?

364
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,475
LONG AGO.

365
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,812
PERHAPS AS LONG AGO
AS THE BEGINNING
OF THE EMPIRE.

366
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,148
THE MESSAGE
OF THE SUN,

367
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,150
THAT ALL MEN
ARE BROTHERS,

368
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,277
WAS KEPT FROM US.

369
00:19:55,402 --> 00:20:00,700
PERHAPS I'M A FOOL
TO BELIEVE IT.

370
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:05,412
IT DOES OFTEN SEEM
THAT MAN MUST FIGHT
TO LIVE.

371
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,665
YOU GO ON BELIEVING IT,
FLAVIUS.

372
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,792
ALL MEN<i> ARE</i> BROTHERS.

373
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,885
FLAVIUS.

374
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,474
YOUR FRIENDS ARE
WAITING FOR YOU.

375
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,559
YOU'VE ALREADY
BEEN MATCHED

376
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,019
FOR THE MORNING
GAMES. COME.

377
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,687
I WILL NOT FIGHT.

378
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,564
I'M A BROTHER
OF THE SUN.

379
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,691
PUT A SWORD
IN YOUR HAND,
AND YOU'LL FIGHT.

380
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,901
I KNOW YOU, FLAVIUS.

381
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,195
YOU'RE AS PEACEFUL
AS A BULL.

382
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,955
YOU THREE
COME WITH US.

383
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,166
THREE AGAINST THREE.
WE MAY NEVER HAVE
A BETTER CHANCE.

384
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,376
NO TALKING. OUTSIDE.

385
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,837
I DOUBT IF HE'LL
GET VERY FAR.
HE FEELS ILL.

386
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,797
I DO?

387
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,050
OUTSIDE!

388
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,760
ALL RIGHT, BUT
HE'LL DOUBLE OVER

389
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,386
BEFORE WE GET
VERY FAR.

390
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,304
NO, I--I THINK
I CAN WALK.

391
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,598
I'LL--I'LL TRY.

392
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,601
OOH!

393
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,699
[KIRK]
LET'S GO.

394
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,617
WELL DONE, JIM...

395
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,083
BUT I'M AFRAID
IT ISN'T THAT EASY.

396
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,503
THEY'VE BEEN HANDLING SLAVES
HERE FOR 2,000 YEARS.

397
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,422
BUT IT WAS EXCITING.

398
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,092
THEY'D DO WELL
IN THE ARENA.

399
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,594
CAPTAIN MERIK, IS IT?

400
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,345
YES, IT'S ME.

401
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,016
THIS IS OUR PROCONSUL
CLAUDIUS MARCUS.

402
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:52,103
BUT THIS IS NO PLACE
FOR A REUNION.

403
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,063
THIS WAY.
YOUR FRIENDS, TOO.

404
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:04,907
THERE'S LOTS
TO TALK ABOUT,
LOTS TO EXPLAIN.

405
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,867
I AGREE.

406
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,497
DON'T JUDGE ME BEFORE
YOU KNOW THE FACTS.

407
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,877
COME ON. WE CAN
TALK FREELY HERE.

408
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,213
THE PROCONSUL KNOWS
WHO AND WHAT WE ARE.

409
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,351
YOU CAN
LEAVE US.

410
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,272
WELL,
A CELEBRATION.

411
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,858
A MEETING
OF OLD FRIENDS.

412
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,442
PREPARE FOOD
FOR OUR FRIENDS.

413
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,278
THEY'VE COME FROM
A GREAT DISTANCE.

414
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,780
GREAT DISTANCE,
INDEED.

415
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,825
SO THIS IS A VULCAN.

416
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,285
INTERESTING.

417
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,452
FROM WHAT
I'VE HEARD,

418
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:54,248
I WISH I HAD 50 OF
YOU FOR THE ARENA.

419
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,791
THIS OTHER IS
YOUR SHIP'S
SURGEON?

420
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,543
McCOY.

421
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,337
IT'S A PITY WE CAN'T
LET HIM LOOSE

422
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,546
IN OUR HOSPITALS.

423
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,672
OUR LEVEL
OF MEDICINE

424
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,840
WOULD IMPROVE
IMMEASURABLY,
I'M SURE.

425
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,842
COME. YOU MUST
BE HUNGRY.

426
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,886
GENTLEMEN.

427
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,731
OH, TRY THE SPARROW
BROILED IN GARUM.

428
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,191
DELICIOUS.

429
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,276
OR PERHAPS SOME
OF THIS ROAST KID.

430
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,195
LOVELY THING,
ISN'T SHE?

431
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,197
[CHUCKLES]

432
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,574
MERIK,
WHAT HAPPENED?

433
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,161
WE HAD METEOR
DAMAGE, JIM.

434
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,456
I WENT ASHORE
WITH A LANDING PARTY

435
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,709
TO LOOK FOR IRIDIUM ORE
FOR REPAIRS,

436
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,419
AND I MET THIS GENTLEMAN.

437
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,589
GO ON.

438
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,591
HE CONVINCED ME
IT WOULD BE UNFAIR
TO THIS WORLD

439
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,927
TO CARRY WORD OF
THEIR EXISTENCE ELSEWHERE.

440
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,845
CONTAMINATION.
CAN'T RISK THAT.

441
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:54,516
OH, UH, YOU'LL
UNDERSTAND AS YOU
LEARN MORE ABOUT US.

442
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,310
SO I MADE THE DECISION
TO STAY.

443
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,563
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR CREW?

444
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:06,320
DID THEY VOLUNTARILY BEAM--
COME ASHORE?

445
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,032
THIS IS
AN ORDERED WORLD, JIM,

446
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,242
A CONSERVATIVE WORLD

447
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,245
BASED ON TIME-HONORED
ROMAN STRENGTHS AND VIRTUES.

448
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,871
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR CREW?

449
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,250
THERE'S BEEN NO WAR HERE
FOR OVER 400 YEARS, JIM.

450
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,500
COULD, LET'S SAY,

451
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,628
YOUR LAND
OF THAT SAME ERA
MAKE THAT SAME BOAST?

452
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,423
I THINK YOU CAN SEE

453
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,925
WHY THEY DON'T WANT
TO HAVE THEIR STABILITY
CONTAMINATED

454
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,304
BY DANGEROUS IDEAS
OF OTHER WAYS AND PLACES.

455
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,390
INTERESTING, AND GIVEN
A CONSERVATIVE EMPIRE,

456
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,349
QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE.

457
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,892
ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR HEAD?

458
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,560
I SAID I UNDERSTOOD IT,
DOCTOR.

459
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,604
I FIND THE CHECKS
AND BALANCES OF
THIS CIVILIZATION

460
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,898
QUITE ILLUMINATING.

461
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,609
NEXT HE'LL BE TELLING US
HE PREFERS IT
OVER EARTH HISTORY.

462
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,611
THEY DO SEEM TO HAVE
ESCAPED THE CARNAGE

463
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,530
OF YOUR FIRST THREE
WORLD WARS, DOCTOR.

464
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,408
THEY HAVE SLAVERY,

465
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,452
GLADIATORIAL GAMES,
DESPOTISM--

466
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,329
SITUATIONS QUITE FAMILIAR
TO THE 6 MILLION

467
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,538
WHO DIED IN YOUR FIRST
WORLD WAR,

468
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,416
THE 11 MILLION WHO DIED
IN YOUR SECOND,

469
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,876
THE 37 MILLION
WHO DIED IN YOUR THIRD...

470
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,295
SHALL I GO ON?

471
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,880
INTERESTING.

472
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,966
AND YOU, CAPTAIN...

473
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,593
WHICH WORLD
DO YOU PREFER?

474
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:15,806
MY WORLD, PROCONSUL,
IS MY VESSEL,
MY OATH, MY CREW.

475
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,892
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR VESSEL
YOU'VE EXPLAINED.

476
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,978
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR OATH
IS OBVIOUS.

477
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,521
AND AS FOR MY MEN,

478
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,400
THOSE THAT WERE ABLE
TO ADAPT TO THIS WORLD

479
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,361
ARE STILL ALIVE.

480
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:31,447
THOSE WHO COULDN'T
ADAPT ARE DEAD.

481
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,531
THAT'S THE WAY
AS WITH LIFE EVERYWHERE,
ISN'T IT?

482
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,035
YOU SENT
YOUR OWN MEN
INTO THE ARENA?

483
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,661
JUST AS I DID, JIM,

484
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,955
YOU'RE GOING TO ORDER
YOUR OWN PEOPLE ASHORE.

485
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,375
YOU KNOW
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
STARFLEET REGULATIONS--

486
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,835
ARE DESIGNED

487
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,544
TO CIRCUMVENT
ANY SUCH ORDER.

488
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,800
THERE MAY BE OVER 400 MEN
ON YOUR SHIP, CAPTAIN,

489
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,177
BUT THEY CAN BE
BROUGHT DOWN

490
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,179
IF IT'S HANDLED PROPERLY,

491
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,432
SAY, A FEW AT A TIME.

492
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,142
YOU SEE,
I HAVE THE ADVANTAGE

493
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,601
OF A TRAINED SHIP CAPTAIN

494
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,355
TO TELL ME WHAT IS
AND WHAT IS NOT POSSIBLE.

495
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,151
YOUR COMMUNICATOR,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

496
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,198
NOW, DO SAVE US ALL
A LOT OF UNNECESSARY
TROUBLE

497
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:18,160
AND ISSUE
THE APPROPRIATE ORDERS.

498
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,246
THEY'RE GOING TO BE
ARRIVING SOON, ANYWAY, JIM--

499
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,331
A RECON PARTY,
THEN A RESCUE PARTY,

500
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,459
THEN ANOTHER
RESCUE PARTY.

501
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,379
I HAD LESS MEN.
IT ADDED UP THE SAME.

502
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,629
DO YOU
REALLY BELIEVE

503
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,758
I COULD BE MADE
TO ORDER MY OWN
PEOPLE DOWN?

504
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,718
I BELIEVE THIS, CAPTAIN.

505
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,804
THAT YOU WOULD DO
ALMOST ANYTHING...

506
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,098
RATHER THAN SEE
THESE TWO DEAR FRIENDS

507
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,725
PUT SLOWLY TO DEATH.

508
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,566
JIM.

509
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,153
KIRK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

510
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,239
<i>BRIDGE. SCOTT HERE.</i>

511
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,656
SCOTTY, IF YOU
HAVE A FIX--

512
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,497
STAND BY, SCOTTY.

513
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:08,544
VERY WISE OF YOU, CAPTAIN.

514
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,130
NO POINT IN SENDING UP
BULLET-RIDDEN CORPSES.

515
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,798
YET ON THE OTHER HAND,

516
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,883
MY CHIEF ENGINEER'S
STANDING BY FOR A MESSAGE.

517
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,470
I DO HOPE SO,
FOR YOUR SAKE.

518
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,973
NOW, CAPTAIN,

519
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,183
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
ORDER YOUR MEN TO DO?

520
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,440
IF I BROUGHT DOWN
A HUNDRED OF THEM

521
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,108
ARMED WITH PHASERS...

522
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,986
YOU COULD PROBABLY DEFEAT
THE COMBINED ARMIES

523
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,696
OF OUR ENTIRE EMPIRE...

524
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:37,781
AND VIOLATE YOUR OATH

525
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,327
REGARDING NONINTERFERENCE
WITH OTHER SOCIETIES.

526
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,121
I BELIEVE YOU ALL SWEAR
YOU'LL DIE

527
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,706
BEFORE YOU'D VIOLATE
THAT DIRECTIVE.

528
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,375
AM I RIGHT?

529
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,419
[MR. SPOCK]
QUITE CORRECT.

530
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,922
MUST YOU ALWAYS BE
SO BLASTED HONEST?

531
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,594
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

532
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,513
WHY EVEN BOTHER
TO SEND YOUR MEN DOWN?

533
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,139
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,

534
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,849
YOUR VESSEL COULD LAY WASTE

535
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,477
TO THE ENTIRE SURFACE
OF THE WORLD...

536
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,646
OH, BUT THERE'S THAT
PRIME DIRECTIVE
IN THE WAY AGAIN.

537
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,730
CAN'T INTERFERE.

538
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,775
JIM, YOU'VE ALREADY
STARTED A MESSAGE.

539
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,902
YOUR ENGINEER'S WAITING.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

540
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:26,664
SCOTTY. SORRY
TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

541
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,415
<i>WE WERE BECOMING</i>
<i>CONCERNED, CAPTAIN.</i>

542
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,416
<i>YOU WERE</i>
<i>A BIT OVERDUE.</i>

543
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,586
ORDER YOUR OFFICERS
TO COME DOWN.

544
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,796
CONDITION GREEN,
ALL'S WELL. KIRK OUT.

545
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,176
GUARDS, TAKE THEM.

546
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,220
PREPARE THEM
FOR THE GAMES.

547
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,930
AH...THAT WAS
STUPID, JIM.

548
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,642
THIS IS NOT
AN ACADEMY
TRAINING TEST.

549
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,893
THIS IS FOR REAL.

550
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,562
THEY'RE TAKING YOU
TO DIE.

551
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:10,249
SHIP'S LOG--
STARDATE 4041.2.

552
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,792
CHIEF ENGINEER SCOTT
RECORDING.

553
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,169
CAPTAIN KIRK
AND HIS LANDING PARTY

554
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,421
HAVE CHECKED IN,

555
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,548
BUT THEY HAVE USED THE CODE
TERM CONDITION GREEN,

556
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,925
WHICH MEANS
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE,

557
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,636
BUT IT ALSO PROHIBITS
MY TAKING ANY ACTION.

558
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:29,685
MR. CHEKOV, PINPOINT
POWER SOURCE LOCATIONS--

559
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,645
TYPE POWER, LOAD FACTORS,
AND HOW MUCH OUR BEAMS

560
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,772
WILL HAVE TO PULL
TO OVERLOAD THEM.

561
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,608
THAT MAY
TAKE SOME TIME.

562
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,651
LET IT TAKE TIME, LAD.

563
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,405
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE,

564
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,283
AND I'M UNDER ORDERS
NOT TO INTERFERE.

565
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:49,496
HOWEVER,
NO ORDER CAN STOP ME

566
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,583
FROM FRIGHTENING THEM.

567
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,793
MAY DO NO GOOD,

568
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,378
BUT IT MAY SUGGEST
TO SOMEONE

569
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,715
JUST WHAT A STARSHIP
CAN REALLY DO.

570
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,592
AYE.

571
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,352
GOOD EVENING,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

572
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,938
LIVE AND DIRECT
FROM CITY ARENA
AND IN COLOR,

573
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,106
WE BRING YOU
<i>NAME THE WINNER,</i>

574
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,899
BROUGHT TO YOU TONIGHT

575
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,443
BY YOUR JUPITER 8 DEALERS
FROM COAST TO COAST.

576
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,987
IN JUST A MOMENT,
TONIGHT'S FIRST HEAT.

577
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,989
WE'RE GONNA TAKE COMMERCIAL,
PROCONSUL, FOR 40 SECONDS,

578
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,116
THEN WE'LL BE BACK LIVE.

579
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,649
STAND BY. 10 SECONDS.

580
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,317
AND FIRST TONIGHT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

581
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,901
A SURPRISE EXTRA.

582
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,111
IN THE FAR CORNER,

583
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,488
A PAIR OF HIGHLY
AGGRESSIVE BARBARIANS--

584
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,573
STRONG, INTELLIGENT,
WITH STRANGE WAYS,

585
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,702
AND I'M SURE FULL
OF A LOT OF SURPRISES.

586
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,537
AND FACING THEM,
TWO FAVORITES HERE

587
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,163
FROM PREVIOUS ENCOUNTERS,

588
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,832
ACHILLES AND FLAVIUS.

589
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,292
[APPLAUSE]

590
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,884
VICTORY OR DEATH?

591
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,553
AND FOR WHICH OF THEM?

592
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,305
WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

593
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,349
YOU KNOW JUST AS MUCH ABOUT THAT
AT THIS MOMENT AS I DO

594
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,017
BECAUSE THIS IS
YOUR PROGRAM.

595
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,353
YOU NAME THE WINNER.

596
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,104
[CANNED CHEERING]

597
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,948
[CANNED BOOING]

598
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,788
I DON'T MIND FIGHTING,
BUT WHY YOU?

599
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,874
BEGIN!

600
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,593
FLAVIUS MAY BE GETTING OFF
TO A SLOW START,

601
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,219
BUT HE'S NEVER DISAPPOINTED
THIS CROWD--

602
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,387
AND THERE'S A CLOSE ONE.

603
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,180
THE BARBARIAN WITH
THE POINTY EARS

604
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,640
SEEMS TO BE IN TROUBLE.

605
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:19,979
I TELL YOU,
I'M WELL ABLE
TO DEFEAT YOU.

606
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,441
FIGHT, BARBARIAN.

607
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:28,071
MOST OF MY MEN
WENT THE SAME WAY.

608
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,657
I HOPED I WOULD
FEEL IT LESS
WITH YOURS.

609
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,329
I DO NOT
WANT TO INJURE YOU.

610
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,539
OH!

611
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,261
FIGHT, YOU TWO.

612
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,722
YOU BRING THIS
NETWORK'S RATINGS
DOWN, FLAVIUS,

613
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,724
AND WE'LL DO
A SPECIAL ON YOU.

614
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,279
QUESTION, CAPTAIN?

615
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,614
THE RULES.

616
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,449
IF SPOCK SHOULD FINISH
HIS MAN OFF FIRST,

617
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,659
WOULD HE BE ABLE TO HELP--

618
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,202
WE BELIEVE MEN SHOULD FIGHT
THEIR OWN BATTLES.

619
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,582
ONLY THE WEAK WILL DIE,
MY WORD AS A ROMAN.

620
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,546
READY TO ORDER
YOUR MEN DOWN, CAPTAIN?

621
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,556
MAYBE NOW
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY I GAVE IN, JIM.

622
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:40,059
THE ROMANS
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
THE STRONGEST,

623
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,603
AND THEY'VE
HAD PRACTICE

624
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,022
FOR OVER 2,000 YEARS
IN ENSLAVING MEN,

625
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,774
USING THEM,
KILLING THEM.

626
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,234
QUITE TRUE, CAPTAIN KIRK.

627
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,445
THE GAMES HAVE ALWAYS
STRENGTHENED US.

628
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,238
DEATH BECOMES
A FAMILIAR PATTERN.

629
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,616
WE DON'T FEAR IT
AS YOU DO.

630
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,961
AT LEAST
DEFEND YOURSELF.

631
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,880
I AM DEFENDING MYSELF!

632
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,631
NOT LIKE THAT,
YOU FOOL. HOLD
YOUR WEAPON HIGHER.

633
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,475
ADMIT IT.

634
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,561
YOU FIND THESE GAMES
FRIGHTENING, REVOLTING.

635
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,401
PROCONSUL,
IN SOME PARTS
OF THE GALAXY,

636
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,237
I HAVE SEEN FORMS
OF ENTERTAINMENT

637
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,782
THAT MAKES
THIS LOOK LIKE
A FOLK DANCE.

638
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,959
CERTAIN THIS ISN'T
DIFFERENT, CAPTAIN?

639
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,922
THOSE ARE YOUR MEN DYING,
NOT STRANGERS.

640
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,464
I'VE HAD TO SELECT
MEN TO DIE BEFORE

641
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,507
SO THAT OTHERS
COULD BE SAVED.

642
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,885
YOU'RE A CLEVER LIAR,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

643
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,595
MERIKUS WAS
A SPACESHIP CAPTAIN.

644
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,470
I'VE OBSERVED HIM
THOROUGHLY.

645
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,681
YOUR SPECIES HAS
NO SUCH STRENGTH.

646
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,017
HE COMMANDS NOT
JUST A SPACESHIP,
PROCONSUL,

647
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,561
BUT A STARSHIP.

648
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,856
A VERY SPECIAL
VESSEL AND CREW.

649
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,608
I TRIED
FOR SUCH A COMMAND.

650
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,693
I SEE NO EVIDENCE
OF SUPERIORITY.

651
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,153
THEY FIGHT NO BETTER
THAN YOUR MEN DID, MERIKUS.

652
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,655
PERHAPS NOT AS WELL.

653
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,503
[INDISTINCT].

654
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,924
NEED ANY HELP,
DOCTOR?

655
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,926
WHATEVER GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?

656
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,971
FIGHT, YOU
POINTED-EAR FREAK!

657
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,889
YOU TELL HIM, BUSTER.

658
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,349
OF ALL THE COMPLETELY...

659
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,977
RIDICULOUS...

660
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:46,185
ILLOGICAL QUESTIONS...

661
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,647
I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE!

662
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,005
A CLEAR FOUL, PROCONSUL.

663
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,256
YOUR DECISION?

664
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,301
YOUR OPINION, MERIKUS?

665
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,637
AFTER ALL,
THEY'RE LIKE YOURSELF.

666
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,226
IT'S YOUR DECISION,
PROCONSUL.

667
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,896
YOUR OPINION, CAPTAIN KIRK?

668
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,314
YOU LIKE ME
TO KILL THEM NOW?

669
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,399
AN EASY DEATH?

670
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,653
THEN YOU'D GLADLY ACCEPT
WHATEVER HAPPENS TO YOU.

671
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,868
TAKE THEM BACK
TO THEIR CAGE.

672
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:50,208
WELL, IT WON'T GO THAT
EASILY FOR THEM, CAPTAIN...

673
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,835
NOR FOR YOU.

674
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,966
TAKE HIM
TO MY QUARTERS.

675
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,958
I WAS TOLD
TO WAIT FOR YOU...

676
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,633
AND PROVIDE
WINE, FOOD,
WHATEVER YOU WISH.

677
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,846
I AM PROCONSUL'S
SLAVE DRUSILLA...

678
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,890
ALTHOUGH
FOR THIS EVENING...

679
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,602
FOR THIS EVENING,

680
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,355
I WAS TOLD
I AM YOUR SLAVE.

681
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,691
COMMAND ME.

682
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,665
IT WON'T WORK.

683
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,542
WHAT WILL NOT WORK?

684
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,253
WHATEVER HE HAS IN MIND
OR WHATEVER TRICKS.

685
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,464
YOU HEAR THAT, PROCONSUL?

686
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,382
IT WON'T WORK.

687
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,718
I'M NOT COOPERATING.
I MAY DIE,

688
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,803
BUT YOU WON'T GET

689
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,304
ANY ENTERTAINMENT
OUT OF IT.

690
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,557
WE'RE ALONE.

691
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,434
PLEASE BELIEVE ME.

692
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,728
I'VE NEVER LIED
TO ONE WHO OWNS ME.

693
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:55,250
ANGRY, MR. SPOCK?

694
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,503
OR FRUSTRATED,
PERHAPS?

695
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,546
SUCH EMOTIONS
ARE FOREIGN TO ME,
DOCTOR.

696
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,050
I'M MERELY TESTING
THE STRENGTH OF THE DOOR.

697
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:06,552
FOR THE 15th TIME.

698
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:23,278
SPOCK.

699
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,828
SPOCK, UH...

700
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,454
I KNOW WE'VE, UH...

701
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,541
HAD OUR
DISAGREEMENTS.

702
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,210
UH, MAYBE
THEY'RE JOKES.

703
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,585
I DON'T KNOW.
AS JIM SAYS,

704
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,963
WE'RE NOT OFTEN
SURE OURSELVES
SOMETIMES,

705
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,548
BUT WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS--

706
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:46,343
DOCTOR, I AM SEEKING
A MEANS OF ESCAPE.

707
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,261
WILL YOU PLEASE BE BRIEF?

708
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,888
WELL, WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY

709
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,224
IS YOU SAVED MY LIFE
IN THE ARENA.

710
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:55,018
YES, THAT'S QUITE TRUE.

711
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,104
I'M TRYING
TO THANK YOU,

712
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,233
YOU POINTED-EARED
HOBGOBLIN!

713
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,275
OH, YES.

714
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,402
YOU HUMANS HAVE
THAT EMOTIONAL NEED

715
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,821
TO EXPRESS GRATITUDE.

716
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:11,409
YOU'RE WELCOME, I BELIEVE,
IS THE CORRECT RESPONSE.

717
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,493
HOWEVER, DOCTOR,
YOU MUST REMEMBER

718
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:16,539
THAT I AM ENTIRELY
MOTIVATED BY LOGIC.

719
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,291
THE LOSS OF OUR
SHIP'S SURGEON,

720
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,543
WHATEVER I THINK OF
HIS RELATIVE SKILL,
WOULD MEAN A REDUCTION

721
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,795
IN THE EFFICIENCY
OF THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>

722
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,256
AND THEREFORE--

723
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,674
DO YOU KNOW WHY
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
TO DIE, SPOCK?

724
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,593
YOU'RE MORE AFRAID
OF LIVING.

725
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:33,139
EACH DAY YOU STAY ALIVE
IS JUST ONE MORE DAY

726
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,225
YOU MIGHT SLIP

727
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,103
AND LET YOUR
HUMAN HALF PEEK OUT.

728
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,567
THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?

729
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,820
INSECURITY.

730
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,158
WHY, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO

731
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:55,995
WITH A GENUINE, WARM,
DECENT FEELING.

732
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,088
REALLY, DOCTOR?

733
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,179
I KNOW.

734
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:15,098
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT JIM, TOO.

735
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,246
VERY GOOD.

736
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,712
EXCELLENT.

737
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,091
I WAS CONCERNED.

738
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,177
I AM ORDERED
TO PLEASE YOU.

739
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,597
I'VE BEEN IN
SOME STRANGE WORLDS,

740
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,225
STRANGE CUSTOMS.

741
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,893
PERHAPS THIS IS CONSIDERED
TORTURE HERE.

742
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,645
TORTURE?

743
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,148
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

744
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:05,982
I DO NOT WISH
TO SEE YOU TORTURED

745
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,026
IN ANY WAY.

746
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,029
AT THE FIRST SIGN
OF PAIN,

747
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:14,657
YOU WILL TELL ME?

748
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,326
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST
TO KNOW.

749
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,551
CAPTAIN.

750
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:41,518
I'M SORRY.
I WAS DETAINED.

751
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,102
SHOULD WE HAVE
OUR LITTLE TALK NOW?

752
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,396
SO FAR ON THIS PLANET

753
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:45,938
WE'VE KEPT YOU
RATHER BUSY.

754
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,607
I DON'T WONDER
YOU SLEPT THROUGH
THE AFTERNOON.

755
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,698
BY THE WAY,

756
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,117
ONE OF THE COMMUNICATORS
WE TOOK FROM YOU IS MISSING.

757
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,953
WAS IT MY PRETTY DRUSILLA
BY ANY CHANCE?

758
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,500
SEE IF HE HAS IT...

759
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,586
NOT THAT I WOULD
HAVE PUNISHED HER.

760
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,463
I WOULD HAVE
BLAMED YOU.

761
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,215
YOU'RE A ROMAN,
KIRK,

762
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,133
OR YOU SHOULD
HAVE BEEN.

763
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,177
IT'S NOT
ON HIS PERSON?

764
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,262
NO, PROCONSUL.

765
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:20,056
I AM SORRY
I WAS DETAINED.

766
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,558
I TRUST THERE WAS
NOTHING FURTHER
YOU REQUIRED?

767
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:25,270
NOTHING
EXCEPT PERHAPS
AN EXPLANATION.

768
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:30,442
BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN,
I OWE YOU THAT.

769
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:34,653
YOU MUST DIE SHORTLY,
AND BECAUSE YOU ARE A MAN...

770
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:38,657
WOULD YOU LEAVE US,
MERIK?

771
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:39,367
THE THOUGHTS
OF ONE MAN TO ANOTHER

772
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,161
CANNOT POSSIBLY
INTEREST YOU.

773
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,594
BECAUSE YOU ARE A MAN,

774
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,888
I GAVE YOU
SOME LAST HOURS
AS A MAN.

775
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,390
I APPRECIATE THAT.

776
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,309
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE MUST DEMONSTRATE

777
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:07,395
THAT DEFIANCE
IS INTOLERABLE.

778
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,814
OF COURSE.

779
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:12,317
BUT I'VE LEARNED
TO RESPECT YOU.

780
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:15,778
I PROMISE YOU
YOU WILL DIE EASILY, QUICKLY.

781
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,405
I THANK YOU.

782
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,864
AND MY FRIENDS?

783
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,617
WHEN THEIR TIME COMES,
THE SAME, OF COURSE.

784
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,833
GUARDS.

785
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,963
TAKE HIM
TO THE ARENA.

786
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,341
OH, WE'VE PREEMPTED
15 MINUTES

787
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,759
ON THE EARLY SHOW
FOR YOU...

788
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,345
IN FULL COLOR.

789
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,930
WE GUARANTEE YOU
A SPLENDID AUDIENCE.

790
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,976
OH, YOU MAY NOT
UNDERSTAND

791
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,144
BECAUSE YOU'RE CENTURIES
BEYOND ANYTHING

792
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,272
AS CRUDE AS TELEVISION.

793
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,941
I'VE HEARD IT WAS...

794
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,860
SIMILAR.

GOOD EVENING,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

800
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:14,212
BEFORE TONIGHT'S FIRST HEAT,
A SIMPLE EXECUTION.

801
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:15,421
STAY TUNED TO THIS CHANNEL.

802
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,465
THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT
COMING YOUR WAY.

803
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:23,471

SINGLE THRUST.

804

YOU'LL ONLY DIE HARDER.

813
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,515
STAND BACK.

814
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,689
OBSOLETE,
BUT EFFECTIVE.

815
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:15,440
WHAT HAPPENED, JIM?

816
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:16,733
WHAT DID THEY
DO TO YOU, CAPTAIN?

817
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:17,900
THEY THREW ME
A FEW CURVES.

818
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,318
NO TIME TO EXPLAIN.

819
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,572

I PITY YOU,

822
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,414

NOTE COMMENDATION TO
ENGINEERING OFFICER SCOTT.

830
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:25,384
DESPITE
ENORMOUS TEMPTATION

831
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,427
AND STRONG
PERSONAL FEELINGS,

832
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,430
HE OBEYED
THE PRIME DIRECTIVE.

833
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,016
HIS TEMPORARY BLACKOUT
OF THE CITY BELOW

834
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,810
RESULTED IN NO INTERFERENCE
WITH THE SOCIETY

835
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,561
AND YET SAVED
THE LIVES OF MYSELF

836
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:38,063
AND THE LANDING PARTY.

837
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,524
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

838
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,365
GENTLEMEN.

839
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,115
CAPTAIN, I SEE
ON YOUR REPORT

840
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,701
FLAVIUS WAS KILLED.

841
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:51,452
I AM SORRY.

842
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,372
I LIKED THAT HUGE
SUN WORSHIPER.

843
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:56,833
I WISH WE
COULD HAVE EXAMINED

844
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,959
THAT BELIEF OF HIS
MORE CLOSELY.

845
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,629
IT SEEMS ILLOGICAL
FOR A SUN WORSHIPER

846
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,382
TO DEVELOP A PHILOSOPHY
OF TOTAL BROTHERHOOD.

847
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:06,425
SUN WORSHIP IS
USUALLY A PRIMITIVE

848
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:09,094
SUPERSTITION RELIGION.

849
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,056
I'M AFRAID YOU HAVE IT
ALL WRONG, MR. SPOCK,
ALL OF YOU.

850
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:16,227
I'VE BEEN MONITORING
SOME OF THEIR OLD-STYLE
RADIO WAVES,

851
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:20,272
THE EMPIRE SPOKESMAN TRYING
TO RIDICULE THEIR RELIGION,

852
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,400
BUT HE COULDN'T.

853
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:30,491
WELL, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

854
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,910
IT'S NOT THE SUN
UP IN THE SKY.

855
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,830
IT'S THE SON OF GOD.

856
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:42,127
CAESAR...

857
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,421
AND CHRIST,

858
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,297
THEY HAD THEM BOTH.

859
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,759
AND THE WORD IS SPREADING

860
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,468
ONLY NOW.

861
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:52,012
A PHILOSOPHY
OF TOTAL LOVE

862
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,598
AND TOTAL
BROTHERHOOD.

863
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:56,642
IT WILL REPLACE
THEIR IMPERIAL ROME,

864
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:59,186
BUT IT WILL HAPPEN
IN THEIR 20th CENTURY.

865
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,020
WOULDN'T IT BE
