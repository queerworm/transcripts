00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,846
We believe what you say,
Captain Kirk,

3
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,764
but our position
has not altered.

4
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,224
The Halkan Council
cannot permit your federation

5
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,853
to mine dilithium crystals
on our planet.

6
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:21,480
We have shown the council
historical proof

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,273
that our missions
are peaceful.

8
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:27,361
We accept that your federation
is benevolent at present,

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,447
but the future
is always in question.

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,575
Our dilithium crystals
represent awesome power.

11
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,828
Wrongful use of that power,

12
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:39,206
even to the extent
of the taking of one life,

13
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,668
would violate our history
of total peace.

14
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,170
To prevent that,
we would die, Captain,

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,631
as a race if necessary.

16
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,217
I admire your ethics

17
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,387
and hope to prove ours.

21
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,811
Report on magnetic storm,
Mr. Spock.

22
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:05,065
Standard ion type, Captain,
but quite violent and...

23
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,734
and unpredictable.

24
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,402
Rough ride?

25
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,987
<i>If we stay.</i>

26
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,031
Stand by to beam up
landing party.

27
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,742
<i>Plot an extended orbit</i>
<i>to clear disturbance. Kirk out.</i>

28
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:15,993
Comply, Mr. Sulu.

29
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,160
Aye, sir.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,914
When may we
resume discussion?

31
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,833
The council
will meditate further,

32
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,919
but do not be hopeful
of any change.

33
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:28,129

34
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,424
Captain.

35
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,342
You do have the might

36
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,678
to force the crystals
from us, of course.

37
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,932
But we won't.
Consider that.

Trouble, sir.

42
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,896
Spock was right.
It was a rough trip.

Yes, sir.

Status of mission,
Captain?

46
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,172
No change.

47
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,925
Standard procedure,
Captain?

48
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,605
Mr. Sulu, you will program
phaser barrage on Halkan cities.

00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,155
None.

52
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:19,950
Regrettable that this society
has chosen suicide.

53
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,952
Mr. Kyle,
you were instructed

54
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,996
to compensate
during the ion storm.

55
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,497
But I tried to--

56
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,291
Carelessness with the equipment
cannot be tolerated.

57
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,710
But, Mr. Spock,
I tried--

58
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,336
Your agonizer.
No, Mr. Spock.

59
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,672
Your agonizer, please.

60
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,090
No, Mr. Spock!

61
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,634
I tried.
I really tried.

in your section.

80
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,086
There are also injuries

81
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,130
requiring your attention,
Doctor.

82
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,422
Well, gentlemen?

00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,091

00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,309
Due to your error,
Mr. Kyle?

88
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,060
No, Mr. Spock.
Before.

89
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,022
Possibly a result
of the severe storm.

90
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,066
Captain, did you feel
any abnormal effects?

91
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,027
Yes.

92
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,611
Dr. McCoy,
you better look us over.

93
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,155

00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,115
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,786
Mr. Spock.

96
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,914
Have those transporter circuits
checked.

97
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,461
Captain,
what is all this?

98
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,754
How did we get
into--

99
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,923
Not now. Not now.

what's happened?

105

No, not everything.

106
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,325
That spot--

107
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,285
I spilled acid there
a year ago.

108
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,661
Jim,
what in blazes is--

109
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,288
I don't know.

110
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,707
It's our<i> Enterprise,</i>

111
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,210
but it isn't.

112
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,212
Maybe...
Maybe what,
Captain?

113
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,713
Any of you feel dizzy

114
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,757
when we were
in the transporter beam...
Yes.

115
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,842
...when we first
materialized?
I did.

116
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,261
It happened twice.

117
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,304
First we were
in our own transporter chamber,

118
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,638
then we faded.

119
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,849
And then,
when we finally materialized,

120
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,768
we were here,
wherever this is.

121
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,520
Captain, the transporter chief
mentioned a surge of power.

122
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,564
The transporter lock
might have been affected

123
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,149
by the ion storm

124
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,151
and we just materialized
somewhere else.

125
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,695
Yes, here.

126
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,157
Not our universe,
not our ship.

127
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,952

00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,620

129
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,747
a parallel universe

130
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,833
coexisting with ours
on another dimensional plane.

131
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:43,088
Everything's duplicated...
almost.

00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,799

Spock with a beard.

133
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,260
Another Captain Kirk,
another Dr. McCoy, an--

134
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,719
An exchange.
Another--

135
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,263
If we're here...

136
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,557
Then our counterparts
must have been transporting up

137
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,018
at the exact same time.

138
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,272
Similar storms on both universes
disrupted the circuits.

139
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,233
We're here, and they're--

140
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,693
on our<i> Enterprise,</i>

141
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,779
probably asking
the same questions.

142
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,697
Are we in another universe,

143
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,284
and if so, how do we
get back to our own?

144
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,911
They'll use the computer,
and we have to.

145
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,455
What about the Halkans?

146
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,665
We can't let them
be destroyed.

147
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,043
Scotty, can you
buy me some time?

148
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,587
Get below and short out
the main phaser couplings.

149
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,840
They'll think the storm
blew the standby circuits.

150
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,717
Aye, sir.
Then get on this technology.

151
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,761
It's all we have to work with
if we want to get back home.

152
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,721
The intercom

00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,477
Aye, sir.

Yes, sir.

157
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,396
Get up to your post.

Run today's communication

Yes, sir.

165
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,881
Bones, let's take a look
at the library.

166
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,050
We have a lot to learn.

171
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,346
Hm?

172
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,098
I could change your mind.

173
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,393
You are away
from your post, mister.

174
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,271

Is Spock here?

175
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,109

176
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,166

180
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,758

182
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,729
Approaching optimum range.

183
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,444
Commence fire, Captain?

184
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,323
Captain?

185
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,408
Stand by, Mr. Sulu.

186
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:06,207
I've, uh...been ordered
to check phaser couplings

187
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,502
for possible damage
by the storm.

188
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,171
Do you have authorization
from security, sir?

189
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,631
Captain's orders.

190
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,342
I'll have to check with
Security Chief Sulu, sir.

191
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,886
Never mind.
I'll attend to it.

192
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,602
( intercom whistles )

193
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,978
Kirk here.

194
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,523
Phaser report, sir.
No damage.

195
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,733
Very good.
Thank you, Mr. Scott.

196
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,653
Kirk out.

197
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,743
Planet's rotation
is carrying primary target

198
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,663
beyond arc of phaser lock.

199
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,831
Shall I correct orbit
to new firing position?

200
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,583
No.

201
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,420
Lock on to secondary city.

202
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,963
Aye, sir.

203
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,591
Lieutenant Uhura,
contact the Halkan Council.

204
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,801
I wish to talk to them again.
Yes, sir.

205
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,803
Captain?

206
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,056
This is a new race.

207
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,393
They offer other things of value
besides dilithium crystals.

208
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,853
But it is clear that we cannot
expect their cooperation.

209
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,689
They have refused the Empire.

210
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,273
Command procedure dictates

211
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,775
that we provide
the customary example.

212
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,529
Secondary target now moving
beyond our phaser lock.

213
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,323
Put phasers
on standby, Mr. Sulu.

214
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,577
A serious breach
of orders, Captain.

215
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,579
I have my reasons,

216
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,248
and I'll make them clear
to you

217
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,251
in my own good time.

218
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,044
Captain, I have the leader
of the Halkan Council

219
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,880
waiting on channel B.

220
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,717
KIRK:
It is useless to resist us.

221
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,052
<i>We do not resist you.</i>

222
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,055
You have 12 hours
to consider your position.

223
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:48,226
<i>12 years, Captain Kirk,</i>
<i>or 12,000--</i>

224
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,936
<i>we are ethically compelled</i>

225
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:54,023
<i>to deny your demand</i>
<i>for our dilithium crystals,</i>

226
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,775
<i>for you would use their power</i>
<i>to destroy.</i>

227
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,529
We will level your planet
and take what we want.

228
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,863
That is destruction.

229
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,198
You will die as a race.

230
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,743
<i>To preserve what we are.</i>

231
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,870
We will not argue.
12 hours. No more.

232
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,872
Close communications.
Turn phasers off.

233
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,957
Aye, sir.

234
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,417
12 hours, Captain?

235
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,043
That is unprecedented.

236
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,965
I shall be
in my quarters.

237
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,008
Lieutenant Uhura,

238
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,095
have Dr. McCoy and Mr. Scott
meet me there.

239
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,267
( console beeps )

240
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,608
Captain,
you have placed yourself

241
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,568
in a most grave
position.

242
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,861
This conduct
must be reported.

243
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,532
You're at liberty
to do so, Mr. Spock.

244
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,708
Deck five, sir?

245
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,835
(<i> suspenseful music playing</i> )

246
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,766
So you die, Captain,

247
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,185
and we all move up in rank.

248
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,563
No one will question
the assassination of a captain

249
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,817
who has disobeyed prime orders
of the Empire.

250
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,871
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

251
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,498
<i>I command an</i> Enterprise

252
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,999
<i>where officers</i>
<i>apparently employ</i>

253
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,917
<i>private henchmen</i>
<i>among the crew,</i>

254
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,795
<i>where assassination</i>
<i>of superiors</i>

255
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,548
<i>is a common means</i>
<i>of advancing in rank.</i>

256
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,273
Your men, Captain.
Easy, Farrell.

257
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,483
I did your job.

258
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,236
Ask the captain.
Sir?

259
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,196
Yes, he did your job.

260
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,240
Smart boy, switching
to the top dog.

261
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,534
Get him out of here.

262
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,412
Mr. Chekov was going to
make me a chief, sir.

263
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,372
You could make me
an officer.

264
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,791
All right,
you're working for me.

265
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,793
A commission?

266
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,254
You're in line.
You might even make captain.

267
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,505
Yes, sir.

268
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,758
Ohh!

269
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,218
Not on my ship.

270
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,556
The booth
for this one, sir?

271
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,141
Yes, the booth.
Carry on.

272
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:46,946
Here. Here.

273
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,823
What's this?

274
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,158
It's called blood.

275
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,786
Watch your step.

276
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,913
The officers move up
by assassination.

277
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,456
Chekov tried it on me.

278
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,332
Mr. Sulu is
security chief,

279
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,959
like the ancient
Gestapo.

280
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,961
And my sick bay
is a chamber of horrors.

281
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,630
Two of my assistants
were betting

282
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,632
on the tolerance
of an injured man,

283
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,676
how long it would take him
to pass out from the pain.

284
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,177
Report on technology.

285
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,012
Mostly variations
in instrumentation.

286
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,556
Nothing
I can't handle.

287
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,808
Star readings?

288
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,893
Everything's exactly
where it should be,

289
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,562
except us.

290
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,274
Let's find out
where we stand.

291
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,361
Computer.

292
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,281
MALE VOICE:
<i>Ready.</i>

293
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,866
This is the captain.

294
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,952
Record security research,
to be classified

295
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,120
under my voice print
or Mr. Scott's.

296
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,664
<i>Recorded.</i>

297
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,750
Produce all data relevant
to the recent ion storm.

298
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,669
Correlate following hypothesis--

299
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,380
could a storm of such magnitude
cause a power surge

300
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,966
in the transporter circuits,

301
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,426
creating a momentary
interdimensional contact

302
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,386
with a parallel universe?

303
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,639
<i>Affirmative.</i>

304
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,432
At such a moment,

305
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,436
could persons in each universe,
in the act of beaming,

306
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,814
transpose
with their counterparts

307
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,774
in the other universe?

308
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,192
<i>Affirmative.</i>

309
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,529
Could conditions necessary
to such an event

310
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,364
be created artificially

311
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,867
using the ship's power?

312
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,035
<i>Affirmative.</i>

313
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,165
Record procedure.

314
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,167

315
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,210
( beeps )

316
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,882
Scotty, can you do it?

317
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,551
Not by myself.
I'll need help.

318
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,636
And you'd be too conspicuous.

319
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,267
I'm a doctor, not an engineer.

320
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,228
Now you're an engineer.

321
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,857
I'll have to tap the power
we need from the warp engines

322
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,609
and balance it
for the four of us.

323
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,490
Jim, the way
this ship is run,

324
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,702
what kind of people are we
in this universe?

325
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,663
Let's find out.

326
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,164
Computer.

327
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,583

328
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,585
<i>Ready.</i>

329
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,713
Read out official record
of current command.

330
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,464
<i>Captain James T. Kirk</i>

Now we know.

337
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,984
SCOTT:
Captain.

338
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,528
We can do it.

339
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,988
Good.

340
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,241
We have to lay in the automatic
transporter setting,

341
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,994
but when we interrupt
engine circuits

342
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,246
to tie the power increase
into the transporter,

343
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,749
it'll show up
on Sulu's security board.

344
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,334
Of course,
we'll only need a second.

345
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,629
I'll tell Uhura
to create a diversion,

346
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,673
distract Sulu's attention,
at your signal.

347
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,717
We'd better get back
to our posts.

348
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,218
Keep me advised.

349
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,679
Jim.

350
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,681
If we're here,
what do you suppose

351
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,101
our counterparts are doing
back in our universe?

352
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,394
On our<i> Enterprise.</i>

353
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,689
I order you...

354
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,900
let me go!

355
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,407
Traitors!
Spock, get these men off me!

356
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,034
What is this?

357
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,161
What do you think
you're doing, Spock?

358
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,621
You traitorous pig.

359
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,581
I'll hang you up
by your Vulcan ears.

360
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,207
I'll have you all
executed!

361
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,835
I think not.

362
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:32,713
Your authority on this ship
is extremely limited, Captain.

363
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,675
The four of you will remain here
in the brig and in custody

364
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,927
until I discover how
to return you

365
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,720
to wherever it is you belong.

366
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,388
Has the whole galaxy
gone crazy?

367
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,349
What kind of a uniform is this?
Where's your beard?

368
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,392
What's going on?
Where's my personal guard?

369
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,437
I can answer none
of your questions at this time.

370
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,607
Ha-ha-ha. All right, Spock.

371
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,901
Whatever your game is,
I'll play it.

372
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,987
You want credits,
I'll give them to you.

373
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,613
You'll be a rich man.

374
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,283
A command of your own?
I can swing that too.

375
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:05,621
Apparently some kind of
transposition has taken place.

376
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,833
I find it...
extremely interesting.

377
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,127
Spock.

378
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,671
What is it
that will buy you?

379
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,422
Power?

380
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,383
Fascinating.

381
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,552
Power, Spock?

382
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,055
I can get that for you!

383
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,978
Captain.

384
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,856
I am pleased that you frustrated
Mr. Chekov's plan.

385
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,525
I should regret your death.

386
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,152
Why?

387
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,196
I do not desire
the captaincy.

388
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,322
I much prefer
my scientific duties.

389
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,283
And I am frankly content
to be a lesser target.

390
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,369
Logical, as always,
Mr. Spock.

391
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,622
Aagh!

392
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,833
Aaaah!

393
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,377
The agony booth
is a most effective means

394
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,922
of discipline.

395
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,093
Aah!

396
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,474
SPOCK:
I presume you've ordered
full duration.

397
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,227
I haven't decided.

398
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,813
Indeed.

399
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,440
His act warrants death.

400
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,317
I said I haven't decided.

401
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,403
That is, of course,
your affair.

402
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,449
Captain, may I inquire
if you intend to persist

403
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,367
in your unusual course
of action

404
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,827
regarding the Halkans?

405
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,287
You heard my orders.

406
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,289
They are, of course,
in contradiction

407
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,916
to standard
Empire procedure.

408
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,960
You cannot ignore
the consequences.

409
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,920
Is that a threat?

410
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,672
I do not threaten, Captain.

411
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,425
I merely state facts.

412
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,886
I have found you
to be an excellent officer.

413
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,638
Our missions together

414
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,515
have been both successful
and profitable.

415
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:52,686
However, I shall not permit
your aberrations

416
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,189
to jeopardize my position.

417
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:03,281
Spock...

418
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:06,200
Do you think we should
destroy the Halkans?

419
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,662
Terror must be maintained
or the Empire is doomed.

420
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,622
It is the logic of history.

421
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,540
Conquest is easy.
Control is not.

422
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,876
We may have bitten off
more than we can chew.

423
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,379
Captain, I do not wish
to find myself opposing you,

424
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,008
but if you continue
on your present course,

425
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,593
this confusing,
inexplicable behavior...

426
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,972
Is my concern, not yours.

427
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:31,976
You would find me
a formidable enemy.

428
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,103
I'm aware of that, Captain.

429
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:38,191
I trust that you are aware
of the reverse.

430
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,526
(<i> dramatic music playing</i> )

431
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,074
Orders, sir?

432
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,368
Release Chekov.
Confine him to quarters.

433
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,454
Yes, sir.

434
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,971
That ought to hold him
for about six hours.

435
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,970
I fell asleep.

436
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,766
We had quite a time
in the chem lab

437
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,185
picking up after the storm.

438
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,154
Nothing compared
to your day, I gather.

439
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,866
I heard about Chekov.

440
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,535
He gambled, I won.

441
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,247
Mm-mm. You got lucky.

442
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:19,875
I'm surprised that you could be
caught off-guard that way.

443
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,669
I was preoccupied.

444
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,047
Ah.

445
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,758
You're still in trouble
with Starfleet Command.

446
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,762
What you've got in mind
this time is beyond me.

447
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,973
You're scheming,
of course.

448
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,100
The Halkans
have something you want,

449
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,685
or...is it all
some clever means

450
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,688
to advance you
to the admiralty?

451
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,442
Kirk.

452
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,319
The cabinet itself?

453
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,612
Further than that,
if I'm successful.

454
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,572
Really?

455
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,490
Well...

456
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,119
you must know
what you're doing.

457
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,621
You always do.

458
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,249
If I'm to be the woman...

459
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,044
...of a Caesar,

460
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,589
can't I know
what you're up to?

461
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,429
( intercom whistles )

462
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,650
Kirk here.

463
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,652
Mr. Spock, Captain.

464
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,903
<i>Yes.</i>

465
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,989
I've received
a private communication

466
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,531
from Starfleet Command.

467
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,617
I am committing a breach
of regulations

468
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,287
by informing you
of its contents.

469
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,039
Yes, Mr. Spock.

470
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,539
I am instructed to wait

471
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,001
until planet dawn
over principal target

472
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,337
to permit you
to carry out our mission.

473
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,340
And...if I don't?

474
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,550
In that event,
I am ordered to kill you

475
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,179
and to proceed
against the Halkans

476
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:59,099
as the new captain
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

477
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,527
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate...</i>

478
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,153
<i>unknown.</i>

479
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,780
<i>We are trapped in a savage,</i>
<i>parallel universe</i>

480
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,783
<i>from which we must escape</i>
<i>within four hours,</i>

481
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,829
<i>or I will face a death sentence</i>
<i>at Mr. Spock's hands.</i>

482
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,249
Let's drink a toast
to Spock,

483
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,918
the only man aboard
with the decency to warn you,

484
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,669
and he'll die for it.

485
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,587
You'll never find
another man like him.

486
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,298
I don't intend
to kill him.

487
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,342
Are you going to act
against the Halkans

488
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,676
before the deadline?

489
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,303
No, but I'll avoid
killing Spock.

490
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,306
Just get him out of the way,
he and his men.

491
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,893
I'll get out of his way.

492
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:47,064
Shall I activate
the Tantalus Field?

493
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,442
You'll at least want
to monitor him, won't you?

494
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,779
Yes.

495
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,871
I hate this thing.

496
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,668
It's not that bad.

497
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,797
Of course not.
It made you captain.

498
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,259
How many enemies have you
simply wiped out of existence

499
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,052
by the touch of a button?

500
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,845
50? 100?

501
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:23,100
Now, I always thought
that was funny--

502
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,060
the great powerful Captain Kirk,

503
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,729
who owes everything
to some unknown alien scientist

504
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,565
and a plundered laboratory.

505
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,526
Well, if you don't
take advantage
of your opportunities...

506
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,154
You don't rise
to the command of a starship.

507
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,864
Or even higher.

508
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,958
That magnificent mind
of his.

509
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,252
But it can't protect him
from this.

510
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,007
I press it and he dies.

511
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,635
Now?

512
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,810
You really mean it.

513
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:11,440
It doesn't matter.

514
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,943
If Spock fails his order,
he'll be killed anyway.

515
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,030
I'll see to it that
the circumstances of his failure

516
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,697
will clear him.

517
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,745
You're not even afraid
of Starfleet Command.

518
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:31,793
Can your scheme bring you
that much power so quickly?

519
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,004
And what about me?

520
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,215
How does Marlena fit in?

521
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,391
How does Marlena want
to fit in?

522
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,945
( softly )
Scotty.

523
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,364
Scotty here, sir.

524
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,408
We have to get out of here
within three hours.

525
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,950
Spock has orders to kill me

526
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,952
unless I complete
the military mission.

527
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,913
We've got another
deadline too, sir.

528
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,164
<i>Explain.</i>

529
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,999
The two-way
matter transmission

530
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,460
affected the local field density
between the universes,

531
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,878
and it's increasing.

532
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,338
We've got to move fast.

533
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,548
How fast?

534
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,007
Half-hour at the most.

535
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,551
If we miss?

536
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,512
<i>We couldn't get out of here</i>
<i>in a century.</i>

537
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,556
<i>Now, we're ready</i>
<i>to bridge power</i>

538
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,683
<i>from the engines</i>
<i>to the transporter.</i>

539
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,768
You've got to get down there
and free the board

540
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,894
so we can lock in.

541
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,396
Now, give me about 10 minutes.

542
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,856
<i>I've got to complete</i>
<i>a few more computations.</i>

543
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,443
All right, I'll be in the
transporter room in 10 minutes.

544
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,528
I'll meet you
in the sick bay afterward.

545
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,696
Aye, sir.

546
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,158
Computer?

547
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,744
<i>Ready.</i>

548
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,829
Explain computer activity
in the engineering section.

549
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,958
<i>A security research is</i>
<i>in progress.</i>

550
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,086
Who is conducting
the research?

551
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,422
<i>The captain and Mr. Scott.</i>

552
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,261
What is the nature
of the research?

553
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:08,098
<i>Program is classified</i>
<i>under voice index log.</i>

554
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,394
( beeping )

555
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:22,904
Why are you monitoring
my communications, Mr. Sulu?

556
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,865
My security boards detected
extensive use of computer,

557
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,284
Mr. Spock.

558
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,411
I was about to inform you.

559
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,288
<i>It's not hard to guess</i>

560
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:34,750
<i>the nature of your order</i>
<i>from Starfleet Command.</i>

561
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,628
<i>I suggest a...connection.</i>

562
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,338
<i>The captain suspects.</i>

563
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,341
He's working on escape
or defense.

564
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,760
That is my concern.

565
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,928
Correct. It's your play.

566
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,847
I hope you succeed,

567
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,267
because the order
would fall on me next,

568
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,853
and you know how
Captain Kirk's enemies

569
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:59,316
have a habit of...
disappearing.

570
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,276
If I am successful,

571
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,363
you see yourself a step nearer
to the captaincy.

572
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:08,074
I do not want to command
the<i> Enterprise,</i>

573
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,160
but if it should befall me,

574
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,245
I suggest you remember

575
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:16,333
that my operatives
would avenge my death,

576
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,669
and some of them...

577
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,587
are Vulcans.

578
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,975
Oiling my traps,
darling.

579
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:42,484
I'm afraid I'm a little
out of practice.

580
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,278
Maybe that's what happened
to us, hm?

581
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,031
It's very hard
for a working officer

582
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,702
to shine as a woman
every minute...

583
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,705
and you demand perfection.

584
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,165
I've never seen perfection,

585
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:01,002
but no woman
could come closer to it.

586
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:05,173
I remember when you
used to talk that way.

587
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,432
I still do.

588
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,809
Prove it.

589
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,524
I've got to go.

590
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,401
Ship's business?

591
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,153
An important task
on the crew deck?

592
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,912
Well...

593
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,830
I guess it's over.

594
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,459
Commander Kenno
will take me temporarily.

595
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,211
He has made that quite clear.

596
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,255
I'll call a yeoman
to help me with my things.

597
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,382
You don't have to do that.

598
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,177
Are you feeling sorry
for me?

599
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,267
Do I see hesitation
in your eyes...

600
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:00,312
about anything?

601
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,397
I want one thing,
Captain.

602
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,232
Transfer me.

603
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,193
On the<i> Enterprise,</i>
I am humiliated.

604
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,780
On another ship,
I can hunt fresh game.

605
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,073
I've got my rank, and--

606
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,160
Don't I?

607
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,790
I've been a captain's woman,
and I like it.

608
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,374
I'll be one again

609
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,043
if I have to go through
every officer in the fleet.

610
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,254
You could.

611
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,970
I simply meant...

612
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,556
that you could be anything
you want to be.

613
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,663
It's...been a long time

614
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,749
since you've...
kissed me like that.

615
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,463
You're a stranger.

616
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,173
Mercy to the Halkans.

617
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,552
Mercy to Spock...
to me.

618
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,140
Am I your woman?

619
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,979
You're the captain's woman

620
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,064
until he says you're not.

621
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:01,892
Uhura.

622
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,479
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

623
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,481
Scotty's signal should be coming
through any moment now.

624
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,775
You know what to do.

625
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,860
<i>I've got</i>
<i>a pretty good idea, sir.</i>

626
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,446
Keep Sulu's attention
off that board.

627
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,489
<i>I'll do my best, sir.</i>

628
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,241
Good luck. Kirk out.

629
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,545
( beeps )

630
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:42,348
You aren't
very persistent, Mr. Sulu.

631
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,643
The game has rules.

632
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,437
You're ignoring them.

633
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:52,233
I protest,
and you come back.

634
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,654
You didn't come back.

635
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,158
Now you're making sense.

636
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,953
I was... getting bored.

637
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,871
Mm-hm?

638
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,041
Of course
this isn't the time.

639
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,752
Any time's a good time.

640
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,471
I'm afraid
I changed my mind... again.

641
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:25,391
You take a lot of chances,
Lieutenant.

642
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,145
So do you, mister.

643
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,563
So do you.

644
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,200
Take over for me.

645
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,047
Mr. Scott, all clear.
On my way to Sick Bay.

646
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,215
Now it's up to
the captain.

647
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,596
You'll please restrict
your movements, Captain.

648
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,355
What are you doing?

649
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,440
Are you gonna
shoot me now, Spock?

650
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,068
I thought I had until dawn.

651
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,195
I shall make that decision.

652
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:20,321
Since your return
from the planet,

653
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,992
you've behaved in a most
atypical and illogical manner.

654
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,911
I want to know why.

655
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,787
Shoot.
You're wasting time.

656
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,789
I shall not waste time
with you.

657
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,791
You're too inflexible,
too disciplined

658
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,793
once you've made up
your mind.

659
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,089
But Dr. McCoy has a plenitude
of human weaknesses--

660
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,883
sentimental, soft.

661
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:42,635
You may not tell me
what I want to know,

662
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,512
but he will.

663
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,306
You're running
a big risk, Spock.

664
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,267
I have the phaser, Captain,

665
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,229
and I do not intend
to simply disappear

666
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:56,108
as so many of your opponents
have in the past.

667
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,026
If you please...

668
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,444
Sick Bay.

669
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,614
(<i> dramatic music playing</i> )

670
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,707
Yes, of course.
The entire landing party.

671
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,667
Captain, stand over there.

672
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,878
Doctor, it is time
for answers.

673
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,013
How much time, Scotty?

674
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,806
Hardly 15 minutes, sir.

675
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,350
The field density
between the two universes

676
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,311
is starting to close
very fast.

677
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:17,022
Help me get him
on the table.

678
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,024
Well, come on.
Help me get him on the table.

679
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,734
He'll die
without immediate treatment.

680
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,706
Everything laid in,
Scotty--

681
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,749
the time lag
so the operator can get

682
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,584
into the transporter chamber?

683
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,337
All laid in, sir.
Come on, McCoy.

684
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:43,048
We're taking a chance
of not getting back home.

685
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,465
We'll get home.

686
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,925
This won't take long.

687
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,469
SCOTT:
<i>14 minutes.</i>
<i>We've got to go!</i>

688
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:52,015
<i>Will you shut up?</i>
<i>I can save his life.</i>

689
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,311
Do you want me to stop, Jim?

690
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,146
It'll only take a minute.

691
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,566
He is very much like
our own Mr. Spock, isn't he?

692
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,360
You've got that minute.

693
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,487
DR. McCOY:
<i>A little time, he'll live.</i>

694
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,662
What is this,
Mr. Sulu?

695
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:19,084
Mr. Spock has orders
to kill you, Captain.

696
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,378
He will succeed...

697
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,088
apparently.

698
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,592
You will also appear
to have killed him...

699
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,136
after a fierce battle.

700
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,637
Regrettable,

701
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,640
but it will leave me
in command.

702
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:44,984
(<i> dramatic music playing</i> )

703
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,558
Oh!

704
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,273
Captain, we've barely got
10 minutes!

705
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:26,276
Let's go, Bones.
I can't let him die, Jim.

706
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,361
Look, you get down
to the transporter room.

707
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,488
Make sure it's clear.
I'll be there in five minutes.

708
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,656
No longer.

709
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,741
I guarantee it.

710
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,203
Now go on, please.

711
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,191
Why did the captain
let me live?

712
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:25,584
Our minds are merging,
Doctor.

713
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,546
Our minds are one.

714
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,508
I feel what you feel.

715
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:34,886
I know what you know.

716
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,644
A friend.

717
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,147
Activate the transporter.

718
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:49,608
You saved us
back at Sick Bay

719
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,236
with the Tantalus Field.

720
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:52,820
Take me with you.

721
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,531
I can't.

722
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:58,493
I'm sorry.
Our power is balanced for four.

723
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,538
There's no guarantee
that we'll make it with five.

724
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,415
All could die.

725
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:04,623
Scotty?

726
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,167
It's working, sir.

727
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,669
But there are
only three of you.

728
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,422
One is coming.

729
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,592
I'd help you
if I could, Marlena.

730
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,928
Believe that.

731
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:29,315
If you kill us,
you'll still stay.

732
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,950
Where's McCoy?

733
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,663
Time, Scotty?

734
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,416
Five minutes, sir.

735
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,792
Do you know
what they'll do to me?

736
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,545
The power's cut, sir.
They're on to us!

737
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,214
Auxiliary.

738
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,049
It's available.

739
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,135
Can you bridge
to your setup?

740
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,345
Oh, I can get us the power,
but the automatic setting

741
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,306
is linked
to the transporter main.

742
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,808
If we bypass,
that means that someone

743
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,102
has got to operate
the controls manually.

744
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:08,896
One of us will have to stay.

745
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,856
I'll stay, Captain.

746
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,568
Get to the transporter chamber.

747
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,070
You, too, Uhura.

748
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,572
Jim!

749
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,783
That's an order,
Scotty.

750
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,704
Aye, Captain.

751
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,918
What about me?

752
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,129
( mutters )
McCoy.

753
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,218
I cut the transporter power.

754
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,471
It was necessary
to delay your beam out

755
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:43,473
until I could arrive.

756
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:45,558
Take him.

757
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:54,108
Engineering, reactivate
main transporter circuits.

758
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,113
You're a man of integrity
in both universes, Mr. Spock.

759
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,948
You must return
to your universe.

760
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,534
I must have my captain back.

761
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,202
I shall operate
the transporter.

762
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,162
You have 2 minutes
and 10 seconds.

763
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:08,164
With that time,
I have something to say.

764
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,957
How long
before the Halkan prediction

765
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,626
of galactic revolt
is realized?

766
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,336
Approximately 240 years.
The inevitable outcome?

767
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,630
The Empire shall be overthrown,
of course.

768
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,384
The illogic of waste,
Mr. Spock,

769
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,970
the waste of lives,
potential, resources, time.

770
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,516
I submit to you
that your empire is illogical

771
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,267
because it cannot endure.

772
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,270
I submit
that you are illogical

773
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,481
to be a willing part
of it.

774
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:36,275
You have one minute
and 23 seconds.

775
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,819
If change is inevitable,
predictable, beneficial,

776
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,822
doesn't logic demand
that you be a part of it?

777
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,449
One man
cannot summon the future.

778
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,368
But one man can change
the present.

779
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,495
Be the captain of this
<i>Enterprise,</i> Mr. Spock.

780
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,746
Find a logical reason
for sparing the Halkans.

781
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,748
And make it stick.
Push till it gives.

782
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,459
You can defend yourself

783
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,545
better than any man
in the fleet.

784
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:57,380
Captain,
get in the chamber!

785
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,677
What about it, Spock?

786
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,096
A man must also have the power.

787
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,350
In my cabin

788
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,061
is a device that will
make you invincible.

789
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:15,106
Indeed?

790
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,691
What will it be?

791
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,568
Past or future?
Tyranny or freedom?

792
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,653
It's up to you.

793
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,291
It is time.

794
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:38,170
In every revolution,
there's one man with a vision.

795
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,507
Captain Kirk,

796
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,259
I shall consider it.

797
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,869
Spock.

798
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,789
Welcome home,
Captain.

799
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:20,755
What I don't understand
is how you were able

800
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,674
to identify our counterparts
so quickly.

801
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:24,925
It was far easier
for you, as civilized men,

802
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,803
to behave like barbarians

803
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:28,638
than it was for them,
as barbarians,

804
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:31,015
to behave
like civilized men.

805
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,600
I assume they returned
to their<i> Enterprise</i>

806
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,644
at the same time
you appeared here?

807
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:35,978
Probably.

808
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,314
However, that Jim Kirk
will find a few changes,

809
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,274
if I read my Spocks correctly.

810
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:44,069
Jim, I think I liked him
with a beard better.

811
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,404
It gave him character.

812
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,239
Of course,
almost any change

813
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,325
would be
a distinct improvement.

814
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:52,869
What worries me is the easy way
his counterpart fitted

815
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,455
into that other universe.

816
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,124
I always thought Spock
was a bit of a pirate at heart.

817
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,543
Indeed, gentlemen.

818
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,503
May I point out
that I had an opportunity

819
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:03,589
to observe your counterparts
here quite closely.

820
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,591
They were brutal, savage,

821
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,845
unprincipled,
uncivilized, treacherous,

822
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:12,223
in every way, splendid examples
of Homo sapiens,

823
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:15,434
the very flower of humanity.

824
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,312
I found them quite refreshing.

825
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,442
I'm not sure, but I think
we've been insulted.

826
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,403
I'm sure.

827
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,746
Captain Kirk.

828
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,958
Lieutenant,
uh, Lieutenant...?

829
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,169
Marlena Moreau.

830
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,172
I was just assigned
last week.

831
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,429
All right, Lieutenant.
Carry on.

832
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:57,518
You've met her before,
Captain?

833
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,562
Uh, why do you ask?

834
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,188
Your reaction.

835
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,649
One of... recognition?

836
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,983
Oh, no. No, no.

837
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,111
We-we haven't met
before...

838
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,654
exactly.

839
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,489
She just seemed...

840
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,283
a nice, likable girl.

841
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,202
I-I think
we could become friends.

842
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:18,205
It's possible.

843
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,764
(<i> main theme playing</i> )
