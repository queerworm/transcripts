29

HEARD DR. KORBY REMARK

152
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:23,308
HOW FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
AND CHOICE PRODUCED
THE HUMAN SPIRIT.

153
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,312
THE CULTURE OF EXO-III
PROVED HIS THEORY.

154
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,815
WHEN THEY MOVED
FROM LIGHT TO DARKNESS,

155
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,069
THEY REPLACED FREEDOM
WITH A MECHANISTIC CULTURE.

156
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:40,241
DR. KORBY HAS BEEN ABLE
TO UNCOVER ELEMENTS
OF THIS CULTURE

157
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,327
WHICH WILL REVOLUTIONIZE

OH, I KNEW
I'D FIND YOU.

173
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,637
EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT NOW.

174
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,769
OH.

175
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,020
FORGIVE ME, CAPTAIN.

176
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,149
I'M, UH, I'M ROGER KORBY.

177
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,359
THERE'S NO NEED
TO APOLOGIZE, SIR,

178
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,278
AND CERTAINLY NO NEED
TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

179
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,531
THE CAPTAIN LOST
A MAN IN THE CAVERNS,
DOCTOR.

180
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,199
WHAT?

181
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,451
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

182
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,703
THE PIT NEAR
THE OUTER JUNCTION.

183
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,871
THE EDGE
MUST HAVE GIVEN WAY.

184
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,541
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,
CAPTAIN.

185
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,251
PERHAPS
IF I'D BEEN THERE--

186
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,003
I KNOW THE PASSAGES
SO WELL.

187
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,129
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

188
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,257
KIRK TO RAYBURN. REPORT.

189
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,635
I'M REQUIRED TO MAKE
A SECURITY CONFIRMATION.

190
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,219
WHEN I CALL MY SHIP,
IF YOU LIST YOUR PERSONNEL,

191
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,304
CARGO REQUIREMENTS,
ANY SPECIAL NEEDS--

192
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,515
CAPTAIN,
I'D MUCH PREFER--

193
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,390
RAYBURN,
ARE YOU RECEIVING?

194
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,475
I'D PREFER YOU WAITED,
CAPTAIN,

195
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,227
PLEASE, TILL
I'VE TALKED TO YOU.

196
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,356
I'VE LOST CONTACT
WITH MY GUARD.
I MUST CALL MY SHIP.

197
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,150
NO COMMUNICATIONS,
CAPTAIN.

198
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,276
ROGER!

199
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,278
I'M SORRY.

200
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,530
IF THEY SHOULD SEND
DOWN MORE PEOPLE--

201
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:24,489
ROGER, THAT--

202
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,367
HE WON'T BE HARMED.
I PROMISE YOU.

203
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,661
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THERE
COULD BE THINGS HERE

204
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,580
UNKNOWN TO YOU
SO TERRIBLY IMPORTANT--

205
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,415
SIR, ONE MAN IS DEAD.

206
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,876
I'VE LOST CONTACT
WITH THE OTHER.

207
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,420
ANDREA.

208
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,299
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

209
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,760
THIS IS NECESSARY,
CAPTAIN.

210
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,137
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.

211
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,889
ANDREA.

212
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,533
DROP IT!

213
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,880
[CHRISTINE]
OHH!

214
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,310
ENTERPRISE
<i>FROM CAPTAIN KIRK.</i>
<i>COME IN. DO YOU READ?</i>

215
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:40,398
FREQUENCY OPEN,
MR. SPOCK.

216
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,191
SPOCK HERE, CAPTAIN.

217
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,569
<i>CONTACT ESTABLISHED</i>
<i>WITH DR. KORBY.</i>

218
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,946
WE WERE BECOMING
CONCERNED, CAPTAIN.

219
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,573
YOUR CHECK-IN WAS OVERDUE,

220
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,574
AND SINCE WE'D NOT HEARD
FROM YOUR SECURITY TEAM--

221
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,285
<i>NO PROBLEM, MR. SPOCK.</i>
<i>BEAR WITH ME.</i>

222
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,913
[KIRK'S VOICE]
WE'LL RETURN TO THE SHIP
WITHIN 48 HOURS.

223
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,875
DR. KORBY'S RECORDS
AND SPECIMENS WILL
REQUIRE CAREFUL PACKING.

224
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,004
CAPTAIN,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU SOUND TIRED.

225
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,549
IF YOU MOVE OR CRY OUT,
RUK MAY INJURE YOU.

226
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,385
AT LEAST WAIT
UNTIL YOU AND I
CAN TALK.

227
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,305
[SPOCK]
<i>ACKNOWLEDGE, CAPTAIN.</i>
<i>IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?</i>

228
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,848
<i>FINE, MR. SPOCK.</i>

229
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,059
<i>DR. KORBY HAS MADE SOME</i>
<i>FASCINATING DISCOVERIES.</i>

230
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,561

231
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,774
<i>STAND BY FOR REGULAR</i>
<i>CONTACT. KIRK OUT.</i>

232
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,443
THIS IS NOT
A VAIN DISPLAY, CAPTAIN.

233
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,111
I'M A SCIENTIST.

234
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,322
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW
OF MY REPUTATION.

235
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,282
TRUST ME.

236
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,910
YES, I KNOW
YOUR REPUTATION.

237
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:38,247
THE WHOLE GALAXY
KNOWS WHO YOU ARE
AND WHAT YOU STAND FOR.

238
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,083
THAT'S WHY ALL THIS
MAKES NO SENSE.

239
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,503
THERE IS SO MUCH
YOU MUST LEARN

240
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,922
BEFORE YOU MAKE
A FINAL JUDGMENT.

241
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,256
FOR EXAMPLE...

242
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,801
ANDREA.

243
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,764
[ANDREA'S VOICE]
YOU MUST BE
CAPTAIN KIRK...

244
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,184
OF THE STARSHIP
<i>ENTERPRISE.</i>

245
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,900
[KORBY'S VOICE]
CHRISTINE,
IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

246
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,443
YOU SEE, CAPTAIN?

247
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,820
[CHRISTINE'S VOICE]
YES, ROGER.

248
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,280
EVERYTHING
IS ALL RIGHT NOW.

249
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,992
THAT'S ENOUGH.

250
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,243
YOU ARE NOT
TO MOCK CHRISTINE.

251
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,245
YOU WILL
NEVER HARM HER.

252
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,580
OR DISOBEY
AN ORDER FROM HER.

253
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,920
YOU WILL NOT DISOBEY
HER ORDERS.

254
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,006
SATISFIED,
CAPTAIN KIRK?

255
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,508
BOTH LOVE AND TRUST.

256
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:35,054
NOW GIVE ME 24 HOURS
TO CONVINCE YOU.

257
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,932
DOCTOR, DO I NEED
TO BE A PRISONER
TO BE CONVINCED?

258
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,436
WHAT WOULD
YOUR FIRST DUTY BE UPON
RETURN TO YOUR VESSEL?

259
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,272
A REPORT. DO YOU
REALIZE THE NUMBER
OF DISCOVERIES LOST

260
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,358
BECAUSE OF SUPERSTITION?
OF IGNORANCE?

261
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,737
OF A LAYMAN'S INABILITY
TO COMPREHEND?

262
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,656
A SIMPLE LAYMAN'S
QUESTION, DOCTOR...

263
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,830
WHERE IS
MY OTHER CREWMAN?

264
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,665
ALIVE?

265
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,375
DEAD?

266
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,627
RUK WAS PROGRAMMED TO
PROTECT MY EXPERIMENTS.

267
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,256
THE LOGIC OF HIS MACHINE
MIND SAW DANGER TO ME.

268
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,592
WHERE IS MY OTHER CREWMAN?

269
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,428
RUK DESTROYED THEM BOTH,

270
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,932
BUT TOTALLY AGAINST
MY WISHES, I ASSURE YOU.

271
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,562
HE'S AN ANDROID...
LIKE BROWN?

272
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,982
MORE COMPLEX THAN BROWN.

273
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,611
MUCH SUPERIOR.

274
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:35,782
I WAS LEFT HERE
BY THE OLD ONES.

275
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,785
RUK WAS STILL
TENDING THE MACHINERY
WHEN WE ARRIVED HERE.

276
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,996
HOW MANY CENTURIES?

277
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,417
EVEN RUK DOESN'T KNOW.

278
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,003
WITH HIS HELP,
WITH THE RECORDS
I COULD FIND,

279
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,922
WE BUILT BROWN.

280
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:55,009
YOU'VE CONVINCED ME,
DOCTOR.

281
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,553
YOU'VE CONVINCED ME
THAT YOU'RE DANGEROUS.

282
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,601
[CRASH]

283
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,814
RUK, NO!

284
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,366
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

285
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,290
WHY ARE YOU UNHAPPY?

286
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,835
YOU ARE
WITH ROGER AGAIN.

287
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,504
WHERE IS CAPTAIN KIRK?

288
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,096
YOU ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE CAPTAIN?

289
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,556
YES, I AM CONCERNED.

290
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:49,063
HOW CAN YOU LOVE ROGER
WITHOUT TRUSTING HIM?

291
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,319
WHY DOES IT
BOTHER YOU WHEN
I USE THE NAME ROGER?

292
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,530
ANDREA,

293
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,574
IT'S SUFFICIENT THAT
IT DOES DISTURB HER.

294
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:07,081
YOU WILL CALL ME
DR. KORBY FROM
NOW ON, ANDREA.

295
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,582
YES, DR. KORBY.

296
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,920
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO EAVESDROP, DARLING.

297
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,923
AS YOU CAN SEE, UH,

298
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,717
CAPTAIN KIRK IS FINE.
HE WON'T BE HARMED.

299
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,469
THE THINGS AT STAKE HERE
SIMPLY MAKE IT NECESSARY

300
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,430
HE DOESN'T SEND
A REPORT TO HIS SHIP.

301
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,893
I NEED TIME TO EXPLAIN
AND DEMONSTRATE...

302
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,395
TO HIM AND TO YOU.

303
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,689
NOW SHALL
WE START WITH ANDREA?

304
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,693
YES, LET'S
START WITH ANDREA.

305
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:44,202
I'M LIKE DR. BROWN--
AN ANDROID.

306
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,583
DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

307
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,962
REMARKABLE, ISN'T SHE?

308
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,548
NOTICE THE--

309
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,175
THE LIFELIKE
PIGMENTATION,

310
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,886
THE VARIATION
IN SKIN TONES.

311
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,098
THE FLESH--
THE FLESH HAS WARMTH.

312
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,183
THERE'S EVEN A PULSE,

313
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,851
PHYSICAL SENSATION.

314
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,187
HOW CONVENIENT.

315
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,731
CHRISTINE,

316
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,484
YOU MUST REALIZE
AN ANDROID IS
LIKE A COMPUTER.

317
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,695
IT DOES ONLY
WHAT I PROGRAM.

318
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,448
AS A TRAINED
SCIENTIST YOURSELF,
YOU MUST REALIZE--

319
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,657
THAT GIVEN
A MECHANICAL DR. BROWN,

320
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,161
A MECHANICAL GEISHA
WOULD BE NO MORE DIFFICULT.

321
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,955
YOU THINK I COULD LOVE
A MACHINE?

322
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,623
DID YOU?

323
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,334
ANDREA'S INCAPABLE
OF THAT.

324
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,963
SHE SIMPLY OBEYS ORDERS.

325
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,589
SHE HAS
NO MEANING FOR ME.

326
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,841
THERE'S
NO EMOTIONAL BOND.

327
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,052
ANDREA...

328
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:46,097
KISS, UH, CAPTAIN KIRK.

329
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,605
NOW STRIKE HIM.

330
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,109
YOU SEE?

331
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,154
THERE'S NO EMOTION IN IT,
NO EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT.

332
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,697
SHE SIMPLY RESPONDS
TO ORDERS.

333
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,784
SHE'S A TOTALLY
LOGICAL COMPUTER,

334
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,869
A THING.

335
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,122
NOT A WOMAN.

336
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,583
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

337
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,462
IF THESE MECHANICAL
THINGS HAVE NO FEELINGS

338
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,756
AND PERFORM ONLY
AS YOU PROGRAM THEM,

339
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,925
THEN WHY DID BROWN
TRY TO SHOOT ME?

340
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,427
WHY DID HE KILL
TWO OF MY MEN?

341
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:29,431
THERE ARE
MANY THINGS I DON'T
UNDERSTAND, DOCTOR.

342
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:34,520
I WILL ANSWER ALL OF
YOUR QUESTIONS...NOW.

343
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,208
THIS IS HOW

520
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,012
CHRISTINE,
IS THAT YOU?

521
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,410
[BOTH GRUNTING]

522
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,551
CAPTAIN!

523
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,518
CAPTAIN...

524
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,437
WE FINISHED
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

525
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,900
DR. KORBY HAS
CONSIDERABLE CARGO
TO BEAM ABOARD.

526
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,360
I'LL HAVE TO GO OVER
OUR DESTINATION
SCHEDULE WITH HIM.

527
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,404
YOU'RE GOING BACK DOWN
WITH THE COMMAND PIKE?

528
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,199
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
MR. SPOCK.

529
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,992
I'M SICK OF YOUR
HALF-BREED INTERFERENCE,
DO YOU HEAR?

530
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:27,245
YES, VERY WELL,
CAPTAIN.

531
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,330
YOU LOOK UPSET,
MR. SPOCK.

532
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,707
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT UP HERE?

533
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:31,332
NO PROBLEMS HERE, SIR.

534
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,959
GOOD.
I'LL BEAM UP SHORTLY

535
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:35,045
WITH DR. KORBY
AND PARTY.

536
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,438
SECURITY, SPOCK HERE.

537
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,522
STATUS OF
THE LANDING PARTY.

538
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,565
<i>READY</i>
<i>AND STANDING BY, SIR,</i>

539
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,442
HAVE THEM MEET ME
IN THE TRANSPORTER ROOM

540
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,695
AFTER THE CAPTAIN
HAS BEAMED DOWN.

541
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:03,031
I LOOKED IT OVER.

542
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:07,285
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
PLANET MIDAS FIVE
AN EXCELLENT CHOICE.

543
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,204
A SMALL COLONY.

544
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,998
ABUNDANT RAW MATERIALS.

545
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:14,834
YOU MADE
A GOOD BEGINNING,
CAPTAIN.

546
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,585
THANK YOU.

547
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,005
I FELT QUITE AT HOME
ON THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

548
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,848
ANDREA...

549
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,521
KISS ME.

550
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,717
NO.

551
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,139
NO.

552
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:13,643
NOT PROGRAMMED
FOR YOU.

553
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,157
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
ANDREA?

554
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,701
CONFUSED?

555
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,579
NO.

556
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,340
EMOTION, RUK?

557
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:50,680
YOU DISAPPROVE OF
MISS CHAPEL'S ORDERS
TO SAVE MY LIFE.

558
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,558
TO MAINTAIN
YOUR EXISTENCE

559
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,768
WOULD BE ILLOGICAL.

560
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,854
WHY?

561
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,773
CAN'T YOUR MEMORY BANKS

562
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,235
SOLVE A SIMPLE EQUATION
LIKE THAT?

563
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,905
WHAT HAPPENED...

564
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,991
TO THE OLD ONES,
RUK?

565
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,786
IT'S SO LONG AGO.

566
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:17,623
IS IT POSSIBLE
THEY BUILT THEIR
MACHINES TOO WELL...

567
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,170
GAVE THEM PRIDE

568
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,714
AND A DESIRE TO SURVIVE?

569
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,174
MACHINES THAT WANTED
LOGIC AND ORDER

570
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,676
AND FOUND THAT
FRUSTRATED

571
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,512
BY THE ILLOGICAL
EMOTIONAL CREATURES
THAT BUILT THEM?

572
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,513
YES.

573
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,057
THE OLD ONES.

574
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:37,060
THE ONES
WHO MADE US.

575
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,230
THEY GREW FEARFUL
OF US.

576
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,941
THEY BEGAN
TO TURN US OFF.

577
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,068
AND ISN'T IT KORBY
WHO'S CREATING

578
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,154
THE SAME DANGER TO YOU
ALL OVER AGAIN?

579
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,532
UNLIKE YOU,
WE HUMANS ARE FULL OF
UNPREDICTABLE EMOTIONS

580
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,534
THAT LOGIC CANNOT SOLVE.

581
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,660
YES.

582
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:59,040
YES. IT HAD BEEN
SO LONG AGO,
I HAD FORGOTTEN.

583
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,625
THE OLD ONES HERE.

584
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,086
THE ONES
WHO MADE US, YES.

585
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,089
YES, IT IS STILL
IN MY MEMORY BANKS.

586
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:10,135
IT BECAME NECESSARY
TO DESTROY THEM.

587
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,429
YOU ARE INCONSISTENT.

588
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,140
YOU CANNOT
BE PROGRAMMED.

589
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,850
YOU ARE INFERIOR.

590
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,104
AND KORBY?

591
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,106
YOU CAME
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

592
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,732
YOU BRING DISORDER HERE.

593
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,067
THE DANGER TO YOU
IS KORBY.

594
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,485
I WAS PROGRAMMED
BY KORBY.

595
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,070
I CANNOT HARM HIM.

596
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,072
THE OLD ONES
PROGRAMMED YOU, TOO,

597
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,158
BUT IT BECAME POSSIBLE
TO DESTROY THEM.

598
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:36,119
<i>THAT</i> WAS THE EQUATION!

599
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,495
UGH!

600
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,705
EXISTENCE!

601
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:44,085
SURVIVAL MUST
CANCEL OUT PROGRAMMING.

602
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,629
THAT'S IT, RUK!
LOGIC!

603
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,631
YOU CAN'T
PROTECT SOMEONE

604
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,091
WHO'S TRYING
TO DESTROY YOU!

605
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,885
RUK, I WOULD LIKE--
AH!

606
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,641
YOU BROUGHT HIM AMONG US.

607
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,602
YOU BROUGHT
THE INFERIOR ONES.

608
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:05,398
WE HAD CLEANSED OURSELVES
OF THEM,

609
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,360
NOW YOU BRING
THE EVIL BACK!

610
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,695
RUK! STOP!

611
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:13,948
YOUR PROGRAMMING.

612
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,967
I HAD NO CHOICE.

613
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,565
YOU HAD RESPECT
FOR ALL THINGS ALIVE.

614
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,192
HOW CAN I EXPLAIN
THE CHANGE IN YOU?

615
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:52,111
IF I WAS TO
TELL EARTH THAT
I WAS IN YOUR HANDS--

616
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,655
TELL THEM WHAT HAS
BECOME...

617
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,663
OH!

618
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,762
IT'S STILL ME,
CHRISTINE.

619
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,932
ROGER.

620
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,560
I'M IN HERE.

621
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:28,064
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW IT WAS.

622
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,774
I WAS FROZEN...

623
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,193
DYING.

624
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,861
MY LEGS WERE GONE.

625
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,696
I WAS...

626
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,950
I HAD ONLY MY BRAIN
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.

627
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,289
THIS CAN BE REPAIRED,

628
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:47,500
EASIER THAN ANOTHER MAN
CAN SET A BROKEN FINGER.

629
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,669
I'M STILL THE SAME
AS I WAS BEFORE,
CHRISTINE,

630
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,839
PERHAPS EVEN BETTER.

631
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,428
ARE YOU, ROGER?

632
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,721
[ALARM BEEPING]

633
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,605
ANDREA.

634
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,106
<i>YES, DOCTOR.</i>

635
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,941
THERE'S SOMEONE
IN THE OUTER JUNCTION.

636
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,485
SPOCK.

637
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,777
HE MUST'VE
GOT MY MESSAGE.

638
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,071
<i>I WILL FIND RUK.</i>

639
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,532
HE'LL NEVER FIND US
IN THIS MAZE.

640
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,325
RUK HAS BEEN SHUT OFF.

641
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,619
<i>GET A WEAPON.</i>
<i>DEAL WITH IT.</i>

642
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,996
<i>PROTECT.</i>

643
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:40,845
I WILL KISS YOU.

644
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:41,846
NO.

645
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,056
YOU...

646
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,392
YOU WILL NOT.

647
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,686
IT IS ILLOGICAL.

648
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,444
I'M THE SAME!

649
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:57,945
A DIRECT TRANSFER.

650
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,656
ALL OF ME,

651
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,449
HUMAN, RATIONAL,
AND WITHOUT A FLAW.

652
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,576
HE FREED HIMSELF,
AND I DESTROYED--

653
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,663
DESTROYED HIM?

654
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,007
I'M...NOT PROGRAMMED
FOR ALARMS.

655
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,093
I LISTENED
TO YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.

656
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,388
THEY WERE MISSTATED.

657
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:24,805
SHE KILLED
THE ANDROID, KORBY.

658
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,098
THE SAME WAY
YOU KILLED RUK.

659
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,601
IS THIS
YOUR PERFECT WORLD,

660
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:33,439
YOUR FLAWLESS BEINGS
KILLING OFF ONE ANOTHER?

661
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:35,858
AREN'T YOU DOING
EXACTLY WHAT YOU HATE
MOST IN HUMANS,

662
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,528
KILLING WITH NO MORE CONCERN
THAN WHEN YOU TURN OFF
A LIGHT?

663
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,821
I AM NOT A COMPUTER.

664
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,990
TEST ME.

665
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,742
ASK ME TO SOLVE
ANY...

666
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,581
EQUA--

667
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:54,252
TRANSMI--

668
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:02,343
CHRISTINE,
CHRISTINE,

669
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,679
LET ME PROVE MYSELF.

670
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,473
DOES THIS MAKE
SUCH A DIFFERENCE?

671
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,559
DON'T YOU SEE, ROGER?

672
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:12,895
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE
HAS PROVED IT ISN'T YOU.

673
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,441
I AM ROGER KORBY!

674
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:18,234
THEN PROVE IT.

675
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,362
GIVE ME THAT PHASER GUN.

676
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,407
IF THERE'S ANY HUMAN
LEFT IN YOU,

677
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:25,533
GIVE IT TO ME.

678
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:26,701
NO.

679
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,078
YOU WILL
NEVER UNDERSTAND.

680
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,706
I CONSTRUCTED
A PERFECT BEING,

681
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,125
TESTED IT,

682
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,876
PROVED IT.

683
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:39,046
PROVED IT.

684
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,549
PROVED IT.

685
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,274
ANDREA,
GIVE ME THE WEAPON.

686
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,610
NO. PROTECT.

687
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,363
PROTECT.

688
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:14,248
TO LOVE YOU.

689
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,584
TO...

690
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,461
TO...

691
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,713
KISS YOU.

692
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,256
NO.

693
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,383
YOU CANNOT LOVE.

694
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:29,597
YOU'RE NOT HUMAN.

695
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,890
LOVE YOU...

696
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,185
KISS...

697
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,944
OH!

698
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,574
CAPTAIN KIRK!

699
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,622
IN HERE, SPOCK.

700
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,168
CAPTAIN,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

701
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,170
NURSE?

702
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,423
WHERE'S DR. KORBY?

703
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:09,970
DR. KORBY...

704
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:13,391
WAS NEVER HERE.

705
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:38,165
THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME MAKE
THE DECISION, CAPTAIN.

706
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,586
I'M QUITE CERTAIN I'M
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

707
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:44,463
SHE'S STAYING
WITH THE SHIP.

708
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,594
SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU,
MR. SPOCK?

709
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:53,013
FRANKLY,
I WAS RATHER DISMAYED

710
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:57,309
BY YOUR USE OF THE TERM
"HALF-BREED," CAPTAIN.

711
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,147
YOU MUST ADMIT IT IS
AN UNSOPHISTICATED
EXPRESSION.

712
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,192
I'LL REMEMBER THAT,
MR. SPOCK,

713
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,571
THE NEXT TIME I FIND MYSELF
IN A SIMILAR SITUATION.

714
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:16,120
STEADY AS WE GO, HELM.
