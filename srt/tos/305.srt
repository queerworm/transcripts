1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,507
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STAR DATE 5630.7.

2
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,008
WE HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,511
TO CONVEY THE MEDEUSANS'
AMBASSADOR TO THE FEDERATION

4
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:11,846
BACK TO THEIR HOME PLANET.

5
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,472
WHILE THE THOUGHTS
OF THE MEDEUSANS

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,265
ARE THE MOST SUBLIME
IN THE GALAXY,

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,893
THEIR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE
IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,938
THEY HAVE EVOLVED
INTO A RACE OF BEINGS
WHO ARE FORMLESS,

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,273
SO UTTERLY HIDEOUS

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,694
THAT THE SIGHT OF A MEDEUSAN
BRINGS TOTAL MADNESS

11
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,696
TO ANY HUMAN WHO SEES ONE.

12
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,698
MR. MARVICK,

13
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,366
I AM JAMES KIRK,
THE CAPTAIN.

14
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,993
CAPTAIN, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

15
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,536
YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE
BEFORE THE MEDEUSAN
AMBASSADOR ARRIVES.

16
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,496
YES. EVERYTHING
WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF.

17
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,288
THIS IS MR. SPOCK,
MY FIRST OFFICER.

18
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,414
OH, YES,
YOU'RE THE VULCAN.

19
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,750
IT'S ALL RIGHT
FOR YOU TO REMAIN,

20
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,251
BUT YOU, CAPTAIN,
AND THIS OTHER
GENTLEMAN...

21
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,796
MONTGOMERY SCOTT,
CHIEF ENGINEER.
CALL ME SCOTTY.

22
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:46,964
MR. SPOCK, DO YOU
HAVE THE VISOR?

23
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,465
YOU MUST BE SURE
TO WEAR IT.

24
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,925
HUMANS WHO GET
EVEN A GLIMPSE
OF MEDEUSANS

25
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,385
HAVE GONE INSANE.

26
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,220
THANK YOU, MR. MARVICK.
I SHALL BE WEARING
THE VISOR.

27
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,930
WE MUSTN'T KEEP
THE AMBASSADOR WAITING.

28
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,724
IF YOU'LL GO WITH MR. SCOTT,
I'M SURE THE TWO OF YOU

29
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,017
WILL HAVE A GREAT DEAL
IN COMMON.

30
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:58,934
AYE, INDEED.

31
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,561
IT'S A RARE PRIVILEGE

32
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,396
MEETING ONE OF THE DESIGNERS
OF THE "ENTERPRISE."

33
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,606
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
OPEN A CHANNEL

34
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,400
TO TRANSPORTER CONTROL
CENTER ON THE PLANET.

35
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,902
AYE, SIR.

36
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,486
THIS IS CAPTAIN KIRK.

37
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,404
INFORM THE AMBASSADOR
AND DR. JONES

38
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,114
WE'RE READY
TO BEAM THEM ABOARD.

39
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,701
KIRK OUT.

40
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,286
ARE YOU SURE
THIS VISOR WILL WORK?

41
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,121
IT HAS PROVED EFFECTIVE
FOR VULCANS.

42
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,957
IT'S YOUR HUMAN HALF
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

43
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,500
I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO
KEEP IT UNDER CONTROL.

44
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,085
INFORM ME WHEN TRANSPORT
IS COMPLETE.

45
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,558
[TRANSPORTER BEEPS]

46
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,285
WELCOME ABOARD,
AMBASSADOR KOLLOS.

47
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,621
I AM FIRST OFFICER
SPOCK.

48
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,123
I'M DR. JONES.

49
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,210
THE AMBASSADOR
IS MOST HONORED

50
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:11,006
TO MEET YOU,
MR. SPOCK.

51
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:35,238
SPACE--
THE FINAL FRONTIER.

52
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,706
THESE ARE THE VOYAGES OF
THE STARSHIP "ENTERPRISE."

53
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,500
ITS FIVE-YEAR MISSION--

54
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,086
TO EXPLORE
STRANGE NEW WORLDS...

55
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,256
TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS...

56
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,593
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

57
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,318
CAPTAIN KIRK,
WE ARE READY.

58
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,238
LIEUTENANT UHURA,
OPEN A CHANNEL
TO ALL DECKS.

59
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,366
CHANNEL OPEN, SIR.

60
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,452
THIS IS CAPTAIN KIRK
TO ALL SHIP'S PERSONNEL.

61
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,414
CLEARANCE PLANS
NOW IN EFFECT.

62
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,916
CLEAR PASSAGEWAYS
IMMEDIATELY.

63
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:14,379
THE AMBASSADOR
WILL BE ESCORTED
TO HIS QUARTERS AT ONCE.

64
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,939
DR. JONES,

65
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,733
MAY I CONGRATULATE YOU
ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT
WITH AMBASSADOR KOLLOS.

66
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,068
THANK YOU,

67
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,361
BUT THE ASSIGNMENT'S
NOT YET DEFINITE.

68
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,906
IT WILL DEPEND
UPON MY ABILITY

69
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,784
TO ACHIEVE
A TRUE MIND-LINK
WITH THE AMBASSADOR.

70
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,703
I'M SURE YOU WILL FIND IT
A FASCINATING EXPERIENCE.

71
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,998
I WASN'T
AWARE THAT ANYONE
HAD EVER ACHIEVED

72
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,708
A MIND-LINK
WITH THE MEDEUSANS.

73
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,585
NO ONE EVER HAS.

74
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,296
I WAS REFERRING
TO MIND-LINKS
I HAD ATTEMPTED

75
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,548
WITH MEMBERS
OF OTHER SPECIES.

76
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,383
I'VE HEARD,
MR. SPOCK,

77
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,638
THAT YOU TURNED DOWN
THE ASSIGNMENT
WITH THE AMBASSADOR.

78
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,473
I WAS UNABLE TO ACCEPT.

79
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,308
MY LIFE IS HERE.

80
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,705
SPOCK TO BRIDGE.

81
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,916
WE HAVE ARRIVED
AT THE AMBASSADOR'S
QUARTERS.

82
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,501
THANK YOU, MR. SPOCK.

83
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,419
NOTIFY ALL HANDS
TO RETURN TO STATIONS.

84
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,964
ALL RIGHT. LET'S TAKE
HER OUT. WARP FACTOR 2.

85
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,882
WARP FACTOR 2, SIR.

86
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,812
I WOULD APPRECIATE
AN OPPORTUNITY

87
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,023
TO EXCHANGE GREETINGS
WITH THE AMBASSADOR.

88
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,241
I AM SURE THE AMBASSADOR
WOULD BE CHARMED.

89
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,790
I ALMOST ENVY YOU
YOUR ASSIGNMENT.

90
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,960
I SEE IN YOUR MIND
THAT YOU ARE TEMPTED

91
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,671
TO TAKE MY PLACE.

92
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,548
NOT CORRECT, DOCTOR,

93
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,217
ALTHOUGH I AM AWARE

94
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,720
OF YOUR MIND ATTEMPTING
TO CONTACT MINE.

95
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,847
WERE YOU BORN A TELEPATH?

96
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:11,639
YES.

97
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,269
THAT IS WHY I HAD
TO STUDY ON VULCAN.

98
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,395
I UNDERSTAND.

99
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,398
MAY I SHOW YOU
TO YOUR QUARTERS?

100
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,775
I THINK I'LL STAY
HERE A BIT.

101
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,027
AMBASSADOR KOLLOS
OFTEN FINDS

102
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,696
THE PROCESS OF TRANSPORT
SOMEWHAT UNSETTLING.

103
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,781
I UNDERSTAND.

104
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,993
OUR SHIP'S SURGEON
OFTEN MAKES
THE SAME COMPLAINT.

105
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,871
DO CALL
WHEN YOU ARE READY.

106
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,928
WHAT IS IT HE SEES
WHEN HE LOOKS AT YOU?

107
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,056
I MUST KNOW!

108
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,401
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THEY LET YOU GO
WITH KOLLOS.

109
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,986
THEY, CAPTAIN?

110
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,655
THE MALE POPULATION
OF THE FEDERATION.

111
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,199
DIDN'T SOMEONE TRY
AND TALK YOU OUT OF IT?

112
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,492
NOW THAT YOU
ASK, YES.

113
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,411
WELL, I'M GLAD
THEY DIDN'T SUCCEED.

114
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,954
OTHERWISE,
I WOULDN'T HAVE MET YOU.

115
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,372
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

116
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,623
TELL ME, DR. JONES,

117
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,083
WHY ISN'T IT
DANGEROUS FOR YOU
TO BE WITH KOLLOS?

118
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,211
SPOCK I CAN UNDERSTAND.
NOTHING MAKES
AN IMPRESSION ON HIM.

119
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,671
WHY, THANK YOU,
CAPTAIN.

120
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,048
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME,
MR. SPOCK.

121
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,717
BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT,
NO HUMAN CAN LOOK
AT KOLLOS,

122
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,886
EVEN WITH A VISOR,
WITHOUT GOING MAD.

123
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,263
HOW DO YOU MANAGE?

124
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,639
I SPENT 4 YEARS ON VULCAN

125
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,849
STUDYING THEIR
MENTAL DISCIPLINE.

126
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,434
YOU POOR GIRL.

127
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,977
ON THE CONTRARY,
DOCTOR.

128
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,356
I WOULD SAY THAT DR. JONES
WAS INDEED FORTUNATE.

129
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,858
VULCAN IS NOT
MY IDEA OF FUN.

130
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,776
JOY CAN BE MANY
THINGS, DOCTOR.

131
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,821
ON VULCAN,
I LEARNED TO DO THINGS

132
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,864
IMPOSSIBLE TO LEARN
ANYWHERE ELSE.

133
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,032
TO READ MINDS?

134
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,575
HOW NOT TO READ THEM,
CAPTAIN.

135
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,370
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

136
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,455
DR. JONES WAS BORN
A TELEPATH, CAPTAIN.

137
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,748
OH.

138
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,585
VULCAN WAS NECESSARY
TO MY SANITY.

139
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,255
WHAT MOST HUMANS
GENERALLY FIND IMPOSSIBLE
TO UNDERSTAND

140
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,799
IS THE NEED
TO SHUT OUT THE BEDLAM

141
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,468
OF OTHER PEOPLE'S
THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS.

142
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:16,097
OR OF THEIR OWN THOUGHTS
AND EMOTIONS.

143
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:20,018
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
NOTICING YOUR VULCAN
IDIC, MR. SPOCK.

144
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,604
IS IT A REMINDER
THAT AS A VULCAN

145
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,773
YOU CAN MIND-LINK
WITH THE MEDEUSANS

146
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,442
FAR BETTER
THAN I COULD?

147
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,570
WELL, I DOUBT
THAT MR. SPOCK

148
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,322
WOULD DON
THE MOST REVERED

149
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,990
OF ALL VULCAN
SYMBOLS

150
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,076
MERELY TO ANNOY YOU,
DR. JONES.

151
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,495
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

152
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,331
I WEAR IT THIS EVENING
TO HONOR YOU, DOCTOR.

153
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,123
INDEED?

154
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,791
IT'S VERY INTERESTING.

155
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,544
I MIGHT EVEN SAY
FASCINATING.

156
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,337
BUT BACK
TO YOUR MISSION.

157
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,630
DOCTOR, DO YOU FEEL
ANY WAY MAY BE FOUND

158
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,717
TO EMPLOY
MEDEUSAN NAVIGATORS
ON STARSHIPS?

159
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,886
IT WOULD CERTAINLY
SOLVE MANY OF OUR
NAVIGATIONAL PROBLEMS.

160
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,722
WELL, THE KEY IS
THE MIND-LINK THAT
I LEARNED ON VULCAN.

161
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,767
AND ONCE WE HAVE LEARNED
THE TECHNIQUE OF FORMING

162
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,894
A CORPORATE INTELLIGENCE
WITH THE MEDEUSANS,

163
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,397
THE DESIGNERS--
THAT'S WHERE LARRY COMES IN--

164
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,690
CAN WORK
ON ADAPTING INSTRUMENTS.

165
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,777
I DON'T CARE HOW
BENEVOLENT THE MEDEUSANS
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.

166
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,238
ISN'T IT SUICIDAL
TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING

167
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,655
UGLY ENOUGH
TO DRIVE MEN MAD?

168
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,866
WHY DO YOU DO IT?

169
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,952
I SEE, DR. McCOY,
THAT YOU STILL SUBSCRIBE

170
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,456
TO THE OUTMODED NOTION,
PROMULGATED BY YOUR
ANCIENT GREEKS,

00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,450
I DON'T KNOW!

346
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,661
BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES
OF THE GALAXY.

347
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,246
WE MADE IT. WE'RE SAFE.

348
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,915
WE'RE SAFE,
CAPTAIN KIRK.

349
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,875
BONES.

350
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,460
OH, NO. NO!

351
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,837
NO, CAPTAIN.
WE MUSTN'T SLEEP.

352
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,588
NO! NO!

353
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,175
NO. THEY COME
IN YOUR DREAMS.
THAT'S THE WORST!

354
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,176
THEY SUFFOCATE
IN YOUR DREAMS. NO!

355
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,011
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

356
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:25,928
NO.

357
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,722
WE'LL TAKE YOU
TO A PLACE TO HIDE,
A BETTER PLACE.

358
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,016
NO. WE MUST STAY HERE
WITH THE CONTROLS.

359
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,642
COME ON, LARRY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

360
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,477
READY TO SPEED.
SPEED!

361
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,437
SPEED TO THE NEXT
GALAX--

362
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:41,319
MIRANDA. MIRANDA,
YOU'RE HERE...

363
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,321
WITH ME.

364
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,490
YES, LARRY.

365
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,535
I AM HERE.

366
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,582
I DIDN'T LOSE YOU.

367
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,002
OH, MY BEAUTIFUL LOVE,
I THOUGHT I'D LOST YOU.

368
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,588
I AM HERE, LARRY.

369
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,343
UH...

370
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,888
NO...I CAN SEE
WHAT HE SEES.

371
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,097
UHH...UHH...

372
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,808
NO, DON'T.
DON'T THINK OF IT!

373
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,392
LIAR!

374
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,562
LIAR! DECEIVER!
YOU'RE NOT ALONE!

375
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,148
YOU BROUGHT IT WITH YOU.
IT'S HERE. IT'S HERE!

376
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,734
YOU BROUGHT IT WITH YOU!

377
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,152
LIAR!

378
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,237
LIAR!

379
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,030
LIAR!

380
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,323
UHH...

381
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,908
DON'T LOVE HER!

382
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,868
DON'T LOVE HER!

383
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,704
SHE'LL KILL YOU
IF YOU LOVE HER!

384
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,001
I LOVED YOU, MIRANDA.

385
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,932
HE'S DEAD, JIM.

386
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:13,119
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STAR DATE 5630.8.

387
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,829
AS A RESULT OF LARRY MARVICK'S
INSANE FEARS,

388
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,625
THE "ENTERPRISE" LIES DERELICT
IN UNCHARTED SPACE.

389
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,253
WE HAVE NO WAY TO DETERMINE
OUR POSITION

390
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,380
IN RELATION
TO THE GALAXY.

391
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,633
WE ARE IN A COMPLETELY
UNKNOWN VOID.

392
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,223
WHERE ARE WE?

393
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,143
WE ARE EVIDENTLY
FAR OUTSIDE OUR OWN GALAXY,

394
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,477
JUDGING FROM THE LACK OF
TRACEABLE REFERENCE POINTS.

395
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,688
WHEN WE EXCEEDED
WARP SPEED FACTOR 9.5,

396
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,109
WE APPARENTLY ENTERED
A SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM.

397
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,736
I HAVE THE AUTOPSY
REPORT ON MARVICK.

398
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,738
HEART ACTION STOPPED,
CAUSE UNKNOWN.

399
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,781
RESPIRATION STOPPED,
CAUSE UNKNOWN.

400
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,826
BRAIN ACTIVITY STOPPED,
CAUSE--SHALL I GO ON?

401
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,203
YOU MEAN
HE JUST SIMPLY DIED.

402
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,415
I MEAN HE EVIDENTLY
COULD NOT LIVE
WITH WHAT HE SAW.

403
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,041
OR WHAT HE FELT.

404
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,626
DAMAGE REPORT,
SCOTTY?

405
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,086
WE NEED
SOME REPAIRS, SIR,

406
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,672
BUT THE SHIP IS INTACT.

407
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,090
POSITION REPORT,
MR. SPOCK.

408
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,967
IMPOSSIBLE TO CALCULATE.

409
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,969
WE LACK DATA TO ANALYZE.

410
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,180
OUR INSTRUMENTS APPEAR
TO BE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY,

411
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,223
BUT WHAT THEY TELL US
MAKES NO SENSE.

412
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,891
OUR RECORDS ARE CLEAR

413
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,269
UP TO THE POINT AT WHICH
WE LEFT OUR GALAXY.

414
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:23,063
THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO NAVIGATE BACK.

415
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,107
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE LACK REFERENCE POINTS

416
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,360
ON WHICH TO PLOT
A RETURN COURSE.

417
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,611
WE EXPERIENCED EXTREME
SENSORY DISTORTION,

418
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,865
AND WE SHALL DO SO AGAIN
IF WE ATTEMPT TO USE
WARP SPEED.

419
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,327
AND WE CANNOT RECROSS
THE BARRIER USING
SUBLIGHT SPEED.

420
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,412
A MADMAN
GOT US INTO THIS,

421
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,999
AND IT'S BEGINNING
TO LOOK AS IF ONLY
A MADMAN CAN GET US OUT.

422
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,835
AN ENTERTAINING
SUGGESTION, MR. CHEKOV,

423
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,420
BUT NOT VERY HELPFUL.

424
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,422
THERE IS SOMEONE
ELSE ABOARD

425
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,799
WHO MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP US NAVIGATE.

426
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,593
THE MEDEUSANS
HAVE DEVELOPED
INTERSTELLAR NAVIGATION

427
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,845
TO A FINE ART.

428
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,142
COULD KOLLOS FUNCTION
DESPITE THE SENSORY
DISTORTION?

429
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,852
VERY POSSIBLY.

430
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,898
THE MEDEUSAN SENSORY
SYSTEM IS RADICALLY
DIFFERENT FROM OURS.

431
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,068
PERHAPS FOR THE PURPOSE
OF THIS EMERGENCY...

432
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,362
I MIGHT BECOME KOLLOS.

433
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,821
EXPLAIN.

434
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,742
A FUSION--A MIND-LINK
TO CREATE A DOUBLE ENTITY.

435
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,952
EACH OF US WOULD
ENJOY THE KNOWLEDGE

436
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,747
AND SENSORY
CAPABILITIES OF BOTH.

437
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,623
WE WILL FUNCTION
AS ONE BEING.

438
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:24,333
HAZARDS?

439
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,545
IF THE LINK
IS SUCCESSFUL,

440
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,506
THERE WILL BE A TENDENCY
TO LOSE SEPARATE IDENTITY--

441
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,050
A NECESSARY RISK.

442
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,802
OF COURSE, DR. JONES
WILL NOT WISH
TO GIVE ME PERMISSION

443
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,888
TO ACCOMPLISH
THE MIND-LINK.

444
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,848
I DON'T THINK SHE'LL
WANT ANYONE TO INTRUDE

445
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,560
IN THE KIND OF RAPPORT
SHE HAS WITH KOLLOS.

446
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,643
DR. JONES HAS
SHOWN RELUCTANCE

447
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,645
EVERY TIME I'VE ASKED
TO CONVERSE WITH KOLLOS.

448
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:50,859
IN SOME WAYS, SHE IS STILL
MOST HUMAN, CAPTAIN,

449
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,903
PARTICULARLY IN THE DEPTH
OF HER JEALOUSY.

450
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,781
I COULD CONFINE HER
TO QUARTERS.

451
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,866
NOT SUFFICIENT.

452
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,452
HER TELEPATHIC POWERS
ARE FORMIDABLE.

453
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,871
IF IT IS AT ALL POSSIBLE,
HER MIND MUST BE SO ENGAGED

454
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:07,167
THAT NO THOUGHT OF WHAT
I AM DOING SHALL INTRUDE.

455
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,296
I...THINK THAT
COULD BE ARRANGED.

456
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,469
I MAY BE SENTIMENTAL,

457
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,804
BUT THIS IS
MY FAVORITE PLACE.

458
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,722
EARTH.

459
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,100
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO EARTH.

460
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,686
WHAT LOVELY FLOWERS.

461
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:27,854
MAY I TOUCH THEM?

462
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,565
CERTAINLY.

463
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,291
THEY HAVE NO SCENT.

464
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,917
TRY THESE.

465
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,804
OH.

466
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,973
OH, LET ME SEE.

467
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,601
IT'S JUST A THORN.

468
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:11,190
I WAS...HOPING TO MAKE YOU
FORGET ABOUT THIS TODAY.

469
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,900
IT DOESN'T HURT ANYMORE.

470
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,658
YOU MUSTN'T BLAME YOURSELF
BECAUSE MARVICK LOVED YOU.

471
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,328
I DIDN'T WANT HIS LOVE.

472
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,788
I COULDN'T RETURN IT.

473
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,790
BUT SOMEDAY,

474
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,545
YOU WILL WANT HUMAN LOVE
AND COMPANIONSHIP.

475
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:36,340
SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT
HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP
MEANS TO ME?

476
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,966
A STRUGGLE,

477
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,344
A DEFENSE AGAINST
THE EMOTIONS OF OTHERS.

478
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,972
AT TIMES, THE EMOTIONS
BURST IN ON ME--

479
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,809
HATRED, DESIRE,
ENVY, PITY.

480
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,396
PITY IS THE WORST
OF ALL.

481
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,190
I AGREE
WITH THE VULCANS.

482
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,569
VIOLENT EMOTION
IS A KIND OF INSANITY.

483
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,663
ARE YOU WILLING TO SPEND

484
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,331
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
WITH THE MEDEUSANS

485
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,625
IN ORDER TO AVOID
HUMAN EMOTION?

486
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,544
PERHAPS.

487
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,880
A MEETING OF MINDS
IS ALL VERY WELL,

488
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,007
BUT WHAT ABOUT LOVE,
MIRANDA?

489
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,718
YOU'RE YOUNG...

490
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,055
ATTRACTIVE...

491
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,599
AND HUMAN.

492
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,184
SOONER OR LATER,

493
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,063
NO MATTER HOW BEAUTIFUL
THEIR MINDS ARE...

494
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,065
YOU'RE GOING TO YEARN
FOR SOMEONE WHO LOOKS
LIKE YOURSELF,

495
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,816
SOMEONE WHO ISN'T...

496
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,402
UGLY.

497
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,986
UGLY?

498
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,863
WHAT IS UGLY?

499
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,449
WHO IS TO SAY

500
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:47,202
WHETHER KOLLOS
IS TOO UGLY TO BEAR

501
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,288
OR TOO BEAUTIFUL
TO BEAR?

502
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,416
MIRANDA...

503
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,042
I MEANT NO INSULT.

504
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,294
PLEASE...

505
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,805
HERE WE ARE
AMONG THE ROSES...

506
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,642
A VERY ROMANTIC
SETTING.

507
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,895
I WISH THERE WERE
MOONLIGHT, TOO.

508
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,982
MOONLIGHT WOULD
SUIT YOU VERY WELL.

509
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:22,237
I SEE YOU'RE
A VERY COMPLICATED MAN.

510
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,285
KOLLOS, NO.
YOU MUSTN'T
LET HIM DO IT!

511
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,328
MIRANDA...MIRANDA, DON'T.

512
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,330
MIRANDA--
LET ME
GO! NO.

513
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,040
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT A DANGEROUS THING
SPOCK IS PLANNING.

514
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,002
WE MUST STOP HIM!
LET ME GO!

515
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,223
THE "ENTERPRISE"
IS AT STAKE.

516
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,477
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO BE INVOLVED.

517
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,646
WHY?

518
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,357
I'VE ALREADY COMMITTED
MYSELF TO MIND-LINK

519
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,275
WHEN KOLLOS AND I REACH
THE MEDEUSAN VESSEL.

520
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,361
WHY PUT YOURSELF
IN JEOPARDY?

521
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,821
THIS IS NOT A DUTY
THAT YOU CAN ASSUME.

522
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,616
I AM AWARE OF
THE FACT THAT YOUR
TELEPATHIC COMPETENCE

523
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,034
MIGHT BE SUPERIOR TO MINE,

524
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,953
BUT THERE IS A MORE
IMPORTANT FACTOR.

525
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,707
THE OBJECT IS
TO PILOT THIS SHIP.

526
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,667
THAT IS SOMETHING
YOU CANNOT DO.

527
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,252
THEN TEACH ME
TO OPERATE THE SHIP.

528
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,879
I CAN MEMORIZE
INSTANTLY.

529
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,048
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

530
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,884
I REALIZE
THAT YOU CAN DO

531
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,886
ALMOST ANYTHING
A SIGHTED PERSON CAN DO,

532
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,723
BUT YOU CAN'T PILOT
A STARSHIP.

533
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,601
WHAT?

534
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,357
FASCINATING.

535
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,941
I'M SORRY, MIRANDA,

536
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,943
BUT YOU MUST BE REALISTIC.

537
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,863
YOU ARE BLIND,

538
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,742
AND THERE'S SOME THINGS
YOU SIMPLY CANNOT DO.

539
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:56,164
EVIDENTLY
A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED
SENSOR WEB.

540
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,291
MY COMPLIMENTS TO YOU

541
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,793
AND TO YOUR DRESSMAKER.

542
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,087
Kirk: YES, OF COURSE.

543
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,172
IT'S THE ONLY
REASONABLE EXPLANATION.

544
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,091
YOU CAN'T SEE...

545
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,093
AND KOLLOS
CAN'T HURT YOU.

546
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,637
AN ELEGANT SOLUTION...

547
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:13,390
BUT I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU APPARENTLY

548
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:16,101
TRIED TO CONCEAL
YOUR BLINDNESS, DR. JONES.

549
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,311
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

550
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,314
YOU SAID IT.

551
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,360
PITY IS THE WORST OF ALL.

552
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,612
PITY...

553
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,573
WHICH I HATE.

554
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,578
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
GATHER MORE INFORMATION

555
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:38,164
WITH YOUR EYES THAN
I CAN WITH MY SENSORS?

556
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,418
I COULD PLAY TENNIS
WITH YOU, CAPTAIN KIRK.

557
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,503
I MIGHT EVEN BEAT YOU.

558
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,839
I AM STANDING EXACTLY

559
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,508
1 METER, 4 CENTIMETERS
FROM THE DOOR.

560
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:52,137
CAN YOU JUDGE DISTANCE
THAT ACCURATELY?

561
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,013
I CAN EVEN TELL YOU

562
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,891
HOW FAST YOUR HEART
IS BEATING.

563
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,727
NO, THAT WON'T
BE NECESSARY.

564
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,396
MR. SPOCK WILL MAKE
THE MIND-LINK.

565
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,149
NO OTHER DECISION
IS POSSIBLE.

566
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,776
NO.

567
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,193
I WON'T LET YOU.

568
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,528
PLEASE.

569
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,448
DO NOT FIGHT US
LIKE THIS, DR. JONES.

570
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,366
I APPEAL TO YOU
AS A COLLEAGUE.

571
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,993
DO NOT OPPOSE US.

572
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,244
NO.

573
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:19,706
IF WE CAN'T PERSUADE YOU,
THERE IS SOMEONE WHO CAN.

574
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:22,501
YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE THIS UP
WITH KOLLOS.

575
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,421
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE.

576
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,450
BONES, WHY HADN'T
YOU TOLD ME?

577
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,035
SHE WOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU HERSELF

578
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,787
IF SHE HAD WANTED
YOU TO KNOW.

579
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,413
I RESPECT HER PRIVACY.

580
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,042
YES. THERE'S A GREAT
DEAL TO RESPECT
ABOUT THAT LADY.

581
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,169
Miranda: AAH!

582
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,638
IT SEEMS I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO OBEY YOU.

583
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,728
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
SUPPLEMENTARY.

584
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:25,647
OUR ONE CHANCE
TO RETURN TO OUR OWN GALAXY

585
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,858
IS DEPENDENT UPON
THE NAVIGATIONAL SKILLS

586
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,860
OF THE MEDEUSAN
AMBASSADOR.

587
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,653
WITH THAT END IN VIEW,

588
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,655
KOLLOS HAS BEEN
BROUGHT TO THE BRIDGE

589
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,491
AND PLACED BEHIND
A PROTECTIVE SHIELD.

590
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,547
THIS IS DELIGHTFUL.

591
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,717
I KNOW YOU,

592
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,637
ALL OF YOU.

593
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:43,141
JAMES KIRK--CAPTAIN AND
FRIEND FOR MANY YEARS.

594
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,393
AND LEONARD McCOY--

595
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:49,022
HA HA--ALSO OF LONG
ACQUAINTANCE.

596
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,190
AND UHURA...

597
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,860
WHOSE NAME MEANS "FREEDOM."

598
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:56,279
SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY,
LIKE THE NIGHT.

599
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,156
THAT'S NOT SPOCK!

600
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,700
ARE YOU SURPRISED
TO FIND THAT I'VE
READ BYRON, DOCTOR?

601
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,410
THAT'S SPOCK!

602
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:06,123
AM I ADDRESSING
THE AMBASSADOR?

603
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,249
IN PART.

604
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,627
THAT IS, PART OF US
IS KNOWN TO YOU AS KOLLOS.

605
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,967
AH, MIRANDA.

606
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,720
THERE YOU ARE.

607
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:25,100
O BRAVE NEW WORLD,
THAT HAS SUCH
CREATURES IN IT.

608
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:28,728
'TIS NEW TO THEE.

609
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,152
MY WORLD IS NEXT
FOR US.

610
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:45,162
CAPTAIN KIRK,
I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US
YOU CALL MEDEUSANS.

611
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,789
I AM SORRY FOR THE TROUBLE
I'VE BROUGHT TO YOUR SHIP.

612
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,708
WE DON'T HOLD YOU TO BLAME
FOR WHAT HAPPENED

613
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,334
AND THANK YOU NOW
FOR YOUR HELP.

614
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,337
AND NOW,
TO THE BUSINESS AT HAND.

615
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,007
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
CAPTAIN...

616
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,842
YES. MR. SULU,
RELEASE THE HELM
TO MR. SPOCK.

617
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,053
AYE, SIR.

618
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,529
COORDINATION
IS COMPLETED.

619
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,614
THEN GO AHEAD, MR. SPOCK.

620
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,162
WARP ONE
IN 6 SECONDS.

621
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,830
5...4...

622
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,416
3...2...

623
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,501
1...ZERO.

624
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:20,298
POSITION REPORT,
PLEASE, MR. CHEKOV.

625
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,383
OUR POSITION...

626
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,512
OUR POSITION IS SO CLOSE

627
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,141
TO THE POINT WHERE
WE ENTERED THE VOID,

628
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:32,102
THE DIFFERENCE ISN'T
WORTH MENTIONING.

629
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,730
BULL'S-EYE, MR. SPOCK.

630
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,398
THANK YOU,
MR. CHEKOV.

631
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,109
MANEUVER COMPLETED,
CAPTAIN.

632
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,111
TAKE OVER, MR. SULU.

633
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,071
THANK YOU, AMBASSADOR.

634
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,698
MR. CHEKOV,
PLOT A NEW COURSE.

635
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,952
THE NEW HEADINGS WILL BE
PLOTTED IN A MINUTE, SIR.

636
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,127
HOW COMPACT
YOUR BODIES ARE.

637
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,628
[SNIFFS]

638
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,714
AND WHAT A VARIETY
OF SENSES YOU HAVE.

639
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,344
THIS THING YOU CALL...
LANGUAGE, THOUGH...

640
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,180
MOST REMARKABLE.

641
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:09,973
YOU DEPEND ON IT...

642
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,809
FOR SO VERY MUCH.

643
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,436
BUT IS ANY ONE OF YOU
REALLY ITS MASTER?

644
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:20,025
BUT MOST OF ALL...

645
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,277
THE ALONENESS.

646
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,865
YOU ARE SO ALONE.

647
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,908
YOU LIVE OUT YOUR LIVES...

648
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,660
IN THIS...

649
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,995
SHELL OF FLESH,

650
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,414
SELF-CONTAINED...

651
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,083
SEPARATE.

652
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,586
HOW LONELY YOU ARE.

653
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,756
HOW TERRIBLY LONELY.

654
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,717
AMBASSADOR...

655
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,558
YOU MUST
DISSOLVE THE LINK.

656
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,478
SO SOON.

657
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,067
THERE MUST BE
NO DELAY.

658
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,405
YOU ARE A WISE CAPTAIN.

659
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,474
CAPTAIN!

660
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,642
SPOCK!

661
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,144
DON'T LOOK!

662
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,938
COVER YOUR EYES!

663
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,787
Spock: AAH!

664
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,414
DON'T MOVE.

665
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,624
BUT, JIM!
NO ONE IS TO MOVE.

666
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,256
SPOCK...

667
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,590
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

668
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,734
[GASPS]

669
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,613
SPOCK...

670
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,117
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

671
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,870
YOU'RE SAFE
WITH US NOW.

672
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,527
HE'S HARDLY BREATHING.

673
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,446
HELP ME GET HIM
TO SICK BAY.

674
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,579
UNLESS MIRANDA CAN LOOK
DOWN INTO HIS MIND

675
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,916
AND TURN IT
OUTWARD TO US,
WE WILL LOSE SPOCK.

676
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,337
VULCAN MIND TECHNIQUES--
THEY SEEM SO UNTRUSTWORTHY

677
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,506
NOW THAT SPOCK'S LIFE
IS AT STAKE.

678
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,341
HER KNOWLEDGE OF THEM
MAY BE THE ONLY THING

679
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:34,927
THAT COULD SAVE SPOCK'S
SANITY, PERHAPS
EVEN HIS OWN LIFE.

680
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,554
BUT DOES SHE WANT TO?

681
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,268
SHE'S BEEN
IN THERE SO LONG.

682
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,020
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
TO BE DONE.

683
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,480
SHE TRIED TO HELP MARVICK.
MARVICK IS DEAD.

684
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,982
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
MARVICK LOVED HER.

685
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,109
AND SPOCK IS HER RIVAL.

686
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,611
IS THAT ANY BETTER?

687
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,407
EVEN SPOCK FELT THE VIOLENCE
OF HER JEALOUSY.

688
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:57,534
BUT THEY WEREN'T
RIVALS IN LOVE.

689
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,454
JIM...

690
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,249
YOU SHOULDN'T
GO IN THERE.

691
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,918
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
BONES...

692
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,586
DON'T INTERFERE.

693
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:17,762
WHO IS IT?

694
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,972
DR. McCOY?

695
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,894
WHO'S THERE?

696
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,650
CAPTAIN KIRK.

697
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,573
I HAVE NO NEWS
FOR YOU, CAPTAIN.

698
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,868
NO CHANGE?

699
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,747
ONLY THAT
HIS LIFE PROCESSES
ARE EBBING.

700
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,791
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING ABOUT IT?

701
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,335
WHY, WHAT I CAN,
OF COURSE.

702
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,046
WHICH DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE MUCH.

703
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,049
NO DOUBT YOU THINK I CAN
WAKE HIM WITH A KISS.

704
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,759
IT'S WORTH A TRY,
ISN'T IT?

705
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,136
AFTER ALL,
HE'S NOT A MACHINE.

706
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,554
BUT HE IS
A VULCAN.

707
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,222
ONLY HALF.
THE OTHER HALF IS HUMAN.

708
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,182
FAR MORE HUMAN THAN YOU,
APPARENTLY.

709
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,603
FACE REALITY,
CAPTAIN.

710
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,021
HIS MIND HAS GONE
DOWN ALMOST TOO FAR

711
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,315
EVEN FOR ME TO REACH!

712
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,651
IF YOU DON'T REACH HIM
SOON, HE'LL DIE.

713
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,987
BUT THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT, ISN'T IT?

714
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,530
THAT'S A LIE!

715
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,616
OH, YES, IT IS.
YOU WANT HIM TO DIE.

716
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,493
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO HIM ON THE BRIDGE?

717
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:22,827
DID YOU MAKE HIM FORGET
TO PUT HE VISOR
OVER HIS EYES?

718
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,120
YOU'RE INSANE!

719
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,372
YES, YOU KNOW
YOUR RIVAL, DON'T YOU?

720
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:29,000
YOU COULDN'T KEEP HIM
FROM MAKING A MIND-LINK
WITH KOLLOS,

721
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,669
SOMETHING THAT YOU
COULDN'T DO YOURSELF!

722
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,421
WITH MY WORDS,

723
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,508
I'LL MAKE YOU
HEAR SUCH UGLINESS

724
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,302
AS SPOCK SAW
WHEN HE LOOKED AT KOLLOS
WITH HIS NAKED EYES!

725
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:40,970
THE UGLINESS
IS WITHIN YOU!

726
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,805
THAT'S A LIE!

727
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,599
LIAR!

728
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,434
YOUR PASSION TO SEE
KOLLOS IS MADNESS!

729
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,186
YOU CAN NEVER SEE!
NEVER!

730
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,272
BUT SPOCK SAW KOLLOS,

731
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,107
AND FOR THAT HE MUST DIE.

732
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,776
SADISTIC, FILTHY LIAR!

733
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,695
THE SMELL OF HATRED!
THE STENCH OF JEALOUSY
PERMEATES YOU!

734
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,323
WHY DON'T YOU STRANGLE HIM
WHILE HE LIES THERE?

735
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,325
DON'T SAY ANY MORE,
PLEASE!

736
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,160
KOLLOS KNOWS WHAT'S
IN YOUR HEART!

737
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:07,163
YOU CAN LIE TO YOURSELF,
BUT YOU CAN'T LIE TO KOLLOS.

738
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,040
PLEASE GO AWAY!

739
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,056
WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO HER?

740
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,265
MAYBE TOO MUCH.

741
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,851
WHAT'S SHE DOING
IN THERE?

742
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,353
YOU MAY BE RIGHT, BONES.

743
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,021
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
HAVE GONE IN.

744
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,440
SHE WAS BLIND,
REALLY BLIND.

745
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,234
REALLY IN THE DARK.

746
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,236
AND IF HE DIES...

747
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,530
IF HE DIES,

748
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,823
HOW DO I KNOW THAT
I DIDN'T KILL HIM?

749
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:46,327
HOW DO I KNOW
THAT SHE CAN STAND
TO HEAR THE TRUTH?

750
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,173
NOW, SPOCK...

751
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,217
THIS IS TO THE DEATH...

752
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:04,262
OR TO LIFE
FOR BOTH OF US.

753
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,453
SPOCK.

754
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,874
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE PAID A VISIT
TO THE DEVIL HIMSELF.

755
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,043
MIRANDA.

756
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,107
YOU HAVE WHAT
YOU WANTED MOST.

757
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,901
I AM ONE WITH KOLLOS.

758
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,237
WELL, I'M TRULY SORRY
THAT YOU'RE LEAVING.

759
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,863
GOOD-BYE.

760
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,537
WE COME TO THE END
OF AN EVENTFUL TRIP,
CAPTAIN.

761
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:55,581
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D EVEN TALK TO ME.

762
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:58,334
WELL, I HAVE YOU
TO THANK FOR MY FUTURE.

763
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:01,086
YOUR WORDS
ENABLED ME TO SEE.

764
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:04,632
MIRANDA, GOOD LUCK...

765
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,676
HEALTH.

766
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,678
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

767
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,974
I SUPPOSE IT HAS THORNS.

768
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,185
I NEVER MET A ROSE
THAT DIDN'T.

769
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,447
I KNOW NOW
THE GREAT JOY YOU FELT

770
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,617
WHEN YOU JOINED MINDS
WITH KOLLOS.

771
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,244
I REJOICE
IN YOUR KNOWLEDGE

772
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,621
AND IN
YOUR ACHIEVEMENT.

773
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,792
I UNDERSTAND, MR. SPOCK.

774
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,293
THE GLORY OF CREATION

775
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:44,046
IS IN ITS INFINITE
DIVERSITY.

776
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,298
AND THE WAYS
OUR DIFFERENCES
COMBINE

777
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:50,052
TO CREATE MEANING
AND BEAUTY.

778
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:01,313
PEACE AND LONG LIFE,
SPOCK.

779
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:07,820
LIVE LONG AND PROSPER,
MIRANDA.

780
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,655
PEACE.
