WHAT IS IT, WEBB?

3
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,150
A BLIP, SIR. JUST
CAME ON THE SCREEN.

00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,109
HOW DO YOU READ IT?

00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,656
BY THE SIZE OF IT
AND THE SPEED,

7
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,199
IT'S NOT
ONE OF OURS, SIR.

8
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,075
IT DOESN'T EVEN READ LIKE
ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN.

00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,161
WHAT WAS THE APPROACH?

10
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,788
NONE, SIR. IT WAS
JUST THERE, LIKE IT
FELL OUT OF THE SKY

11
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,414
OR SOMETHING.

WATCH THE SCOPE, WEBB.

16

TO SEND SOMEBODY UP
TO GET A CLOSER LOOK.

17
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,801

BEGAN TO DRAG US
TOWARD IT.

00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,931
UNITED EARTH?

175
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,560
THIS IS VERY
DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN.

176
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,604
WE'RE FROM YOUR FUTURE.

177
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,233
A TIME WARP
PLACED US HERE.

178
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,402
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

179
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,905
YOU SEEM TO
HAVE A LOT OF THEM.

180
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,449
HOWEVER...

181
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:18,493
I CAN'T DENY THE FACT
THAT YOU ARE HERE,

182
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,328
WITH THIS SHIP.

183
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,998
I NEVER HAVE BELIEVED
IN LITTLE GREEN MEN.

184
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,751
NEITHER HAVE I.

185
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,002
CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER,

186
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,045
THIS IS MY
FIRST OFFICER,

187
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,089
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER
SPOCK.

188
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,216
CAPTAIN.

189
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,928
FEEL FREE TO
LOOK AROUND, CAPTAIN.

190
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,473
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.
BUT I THINK YOU'LL
FIND IT INTERESTING.

191
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:43,143
INTERESTING IS
A WORD AND A HALF
FOR IT, CAPTAIN.

192
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,656
WE'VE ACHIEVED
A STABLE ORBIT OUT
OF EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

193
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,492
OUR DEFLECTORS
ARE OPERATIVE,

194
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:02,662
ENOUGH TO PREVENT OUR
BEING PICKED UP AGAIN
AS A UFO.

195
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,123
AND MR. SCOTT WISHES
TO SPEAK TO YOU
ABOUT THE ENGINES.

196
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,208
VERY WELL, MR. SPOCK--

197
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,755
ANYTHING ELSE
ON YOUR MIND?

198
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,674
CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER.

199
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,559
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

200
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,812
WE CANNOT RETURN HIM
TO EARTH, CAPTAIN.

201
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,356
HE ALREADY KNOWS
TOO MUCH ABOUT US

202
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,898
AND IS LEARNING MORE.

203
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,443
I DO NOT
SPECIFICALLY REFER
TO CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER,

204
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,030
BUT SUPPOSE
AN UNSCRUPULOUS MAN

205
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,072
WERE TO GAIN
CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE

206
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,367
OF MAN'S FUTURE?

207
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,244
SUCH A MAN
COULD MANIPULATE
KEY INDUSTRIES,

208
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,580
STOCKS,
AND EVEN NATIONS.

209
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,706
AND, IN SO DOING,

210
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,377
CHANGE WHAT MUST BE.

211
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,420
AND IF IT
IS CHANGED, CAPTAIN,

212
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,840
YOU AND I, AND
ALL THAT WE KNOW,

213
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,593
MIGHT NOT EVEN EXIST.

214
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,597
YOUR LOGIC
CAN BE MOST...

215
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,183
ANNOYING.

216
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,523
THAT FLIGHT SUIT
MUST BE UNCOMFORTABLE.

217
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,149
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
THE QUARTERMASTER

218
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,318
ISSUE HIM SOMETHING
MORE SUITABLE?

219
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,571
AND THEN I'LL WANT TO
MEET YOU AND HIM
IN MY QUARTERS.

220
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:18,655

00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,036
MR. SPOCK,

232
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,457
I ORDERED THIS COMPUTER
AND ITS INTERLINKING
SYSTEMS REPAIRED.

233
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,376
I HAVE INVESTIGATED
IT, CAPTAIN.

234
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,295
TO CORRECT THE FAULT
WILL REQUIRE

235
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,922
AN OVERHAUL OF THE ENTIRE
COMPUTER SYSTEM

236
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,799
AND A MINIMUM OF THREE WEEKS
AT A STARBASE.

237
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:25,346
I WOULDN'T MIND SO MUCH
IF ONLY IT DIDN'T GET SO...

238
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,056
AFFECTIONATE.

239
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,101
IT ALSO HAS AN UNFORTUNATE
TENDENCY TO GIGGLE.

[CHRISTOPHER CHUCKLES]

241
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,522
I TAKE IT THAT
A LADY COMPUTER
IS NOT ROUTINE.

242
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,567
WE'D PUT IT INTO SIGNET 14
FOR GENERAL REPAIR
AND MAINTENANCE.

243
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:41,112
SIGNET 14 IS A PLANET
DOMINATED BY WOMEN.

244
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,365
THEY SEEMED TO FEEL
THE SHIP'S COMPUTER SYSTEM
LACKED A PERSONALITY.

245
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,116
THEY GAVE IT ONE.

246
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,452
FEMALE, OF COURSE.

247
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,329
HA HA!
WELL, YOU PEOPLE

248
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,164
CERTAINLY HAVE
INTERESTING PROBLEMS.

249
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,874
I'D LOVE TO
STAY AROUND TO SEE

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,585
HOW YOUR GIRLFRIEND
WORKS OUT, BUT--

251
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,420
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO.

252
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,798
WE CAN'T SEND YOU BACK.

253
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,840
CAN'T?

254
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,472
WELL, SPOCK HERE TOLD ME
THAT YOUR TRANSPORTER
CAN BEAM DOWN AN OBJECT,

255
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,515
EVEN FROM
AN ORBIT THIS HIGH.

256
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,518
IT'S NOT THE TRANSPORTER.
IT'S YOU.

257
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,020
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE.

258
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,356
IF ANYBODY
ELSE FINDS OUT,

259
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,818
THEY COULD CHANGE
THE COURSE OF IT
AND DESTROY IT.

260
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,570
WELL, THEN MY
DISAPPEARANCE WOULD
CHANGE SOMETHING, TOO.

261
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:28,409
I HAVE RUN A COMPUTER CHECK
ON ALL HISTORICAL TAPES.

ANY RELEVANT CONTRIBUTION

263
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,918
LOOK, CAPTAIN,
I DON'T BUY ALL OF YOUR
TIME-ACCIDENT STORY.

264
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,879
NOW, THE EXPERTS CAN
FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE,

TAKE THE RISK.

OUR CAPTAIN IS
AS HEALTHY AS

WE CAN'T GO BACK?

TO WHERE WE BELONG,

338
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,022
THEN HE WON'T BELONG.

339
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,274
WE'RE ROUGHLY ABOUT
THE SAME AGE.

340
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,028
BUT IN OUR SOCIETY,
HE'D BE USELESS.

341
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,863
ARCHAIC.

342
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,950
BUT MAYBE HE COULD
BE RETRAINED,
REEDUCATED.

343
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,285

SOME ADDITIONAL

356

OH? THIS COULD BE
AN HISTORIC OCCASION.

358

CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER
TO EARTH AFTER ALL.

359

WHY? YOU SAID
I MADE NO RELATIVE
CONTRIBUTION.

360
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,498

ON MY PART.

361

CONTRIBUTIONS BY OFFSPRING.

363
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,883

ON THAT FACTOR,

364
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,594

SEAN JEFFREY CHRISTOPHER,

00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:44,224
HEADED, OR WILL HEAD,

WE MUST RETURN
CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER,

378
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,477
THERE ARE
SEVERAL PROBLEMS,

379
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,106
PRIME OF WHICH IS
THE EXPLANATION
OF HIS RETURN.

380
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,441

PLANE WRECKAGE DOWN

381
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,028
AFTER OUR TRACTOR BEAM
CRUSHED IT.

382

IT CRASHED
IN AN OPEN SECTION
OF SOUTHERN NEBRASKA.

383
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,199
THAT MEANS THOSE
SEARCH PARTIES

384
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,159

ALL OVER THAT WRECKAGE.

385
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,453
AND CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER
HIMSELF COMPLICATED
THE MATTER.

386
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,248
WHEN I MADE
VISUAL CONTACT,

387
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,709
I TURNED ON

IF THE CAPTAIN FEELS
DUTY BOUND TO REPORT
WHAT HE SAW,

412
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,242
THERE WON'T BE ANY
EVIDENCE TO BACK HIM UP.

00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,478
BLAST YOUR THEORIES
AND OBSERVATIONS,
MR. SPOCK.

517
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,564
WHAT ABOUT JIM?
HE'S DOWN THERE ALONE,
PROBABLY UNDER ARREST.

518
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,232
HE DOESN'T HAVE
A COMMUNICATOR,

519
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,902
AND WE CAN'T LOCATE HIM
OR BEAM HIM BACK ABOARD
WITHOUT ONE.

520
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,780
I AM AWARE OF THAT,
DOCTOR.

521
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,952
THIS IS THE FIRST OFFICER.

522
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,454
CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER
TO THE BRIEFING ROOM.

523
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,748
NOW, LOOK, MISTER,
YOU AND I HAD BETTER
START COMMUNICATING.

524
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,458
I WANT TO KNOW HOW
YOU GOT IN HERE.

525
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,585
NOW, THAT'S A SIMPLE
QUESTION.

526
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,505
GIVE ME A SIMPLE ANSWER.
NOBODY SAW YOU.

527
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,966
YOU GOT ALL THE WAY
INSIDE HERE WITHOUT
TRIPPING ANY ALARM.

528
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,383
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

529
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,471
BELIEVE ME, COLONEL.
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME.

530
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,139
DON'T TRY TO BE FUNNY.

531
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,099
HOW DID YOU GET IN?

532
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,477
I POPPED IN OUT
OF THIN AIR.

533
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,647
YOU SEEM TO THINK
THIS IS SOME KIND
OF A GAME.

534
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:47,484
NO, COLONEL.
I KNOW IT'S NO GAME.

535
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,320
ALL RIGHT. WHAT DID
YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS?

536
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,489
FOR THE FOURTH TIME,

537
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,283
MY NAME IS
JAMES T. KIRK.

538
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,327
AND HOW DID YOU
GET INSIDE

539
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,746
A TOP SECURITY
INSTALLATION,
JAMES T. KIRK?

540
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,415
I TOLD YOU.
YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME.

541
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,511
UH...COLONEL,

542
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,388
WOULD YOU MIND
BEING CAREFUL WITH THAT?

543
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:19,432
THAT WORRIES
YOU A LITTLE, HUH?

544
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,267
WHAT IS THAT,
A RADIO, TRANSMITTER
OF SOME KIND?

545
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,686
OF SOME KIND.

546
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:23,896
YOU CAN BE
MORE SPECIFIC
THAN THAT, KIRK.

547
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,605
I DON'T LIKE
MYSTERIES.

548
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,941
IF YOU DON'T STOP
BEING CARELESS WITH THAT,

549
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,027
THEN YOU'LL HAVE ONE--
A BIG ONE.

550
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,237
I'LL HAVE IT
DISASSEMBLED
AND EXAMINED.

551
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:33,739
WE ARE NOT DUMMIES,
MISTER.

552
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:37,283
WE KNOW HOW TO
FIND OUT THINGS
WE WANT TO KNOW.

553
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,333
WHAT IS THAT?

554
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:49,337
IS THAT A UNIFORM
OF SOME KIND?

555
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,297
THIS LITTLE THING?

556
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,841
JUST SOMETHING
I SLIPPED ON.

557
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:56,887
KIRK, MAYBE YOU
DON'T REALIZE
HOW SERIOUS THIS IS.

558
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,805
SABOTAGE
OF A GOVERNMENT
INSTALLATION--

559
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,306
DID I SABOTAGE
SOMETHING?

560
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,809
NO. WE STOPPED YOU
IN TIME.

561
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,311
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE DONE IF WE
HADN'T FOUND YOU?

562
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,146
BELIEVE ME, COLONEL,
NOTHING AT ALL.

563
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,025
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE HERE FOR,
NOTHING AT ALL?

564
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,526
THAT'S WHAT WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED

565
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,194
IF YOU HADN'T
INTERFERED.

566
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,115
ALL RIGHT, KIRK.
MAYBE THIS WILL
MAKE YOU LAUGH--

567
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,827
SABOTAGE, ESPIONAGE,
UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY,
BURGLARY!

568
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,370
HOW ARE THOSE
FOR STARTERS?

569
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,246
AND I CAN THINK UP
LOTS MORE

570
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,248
IF YOU DON'T
START TALKING.

571
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,708
ALL RIGHT, COLONEL.

572
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,211
THE TRUTH IS,
I'M A LITTLE GREEN MAN
FROM ALPHA CENTAURI,

573
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,964
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
YOU OUGHT TO SEE IT.

574
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:36,635
I AM GOING
TO LOCK YOU UP
FOR 200 YEARS.

575
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,600
THAT OUGHT TO BE
JUST ABOUT RIGHT.

576
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,109
HE'S PROBABLY
BEING HELD
IN SECURITY SECTION.

577
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,111
EVEN IF
THEY'VE NOTIFIED
THE AUTHORITIES,

578
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,321
IT'LL TAKE A LITTLE
TIME FOR SOMEONE
TO GET THERE.

579
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,405
QUITE LOGICAL, CAPTAIN.

580
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,991
CAN YOU GIVE US
THE COORDINATES

581
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,493
TO BEAM DOWN
A LANDING PARTY NEAR
THOSE INTERROGATION ROOMS?

582
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,830
YES. BUT YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO GET THEM

583
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,539
UNLESS YOU TAKE ME
WITH YOU.

584
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,669
I CAN'T DO THAT,
CAPTAIN.

585
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,629
IF SOMETHING
WENT WRONG--

586
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,965
SOMETHING'S
ALREADY GONE WRONG.

587
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,968
OF COURSE,

588
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,511
YOU COULD BEAM DOWN
ANYWHERE INSIDE
THAT BASE,

589
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,179
BUT IT WOULD TAKE
TIME TO FIND HIM.

590
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:31,023
MR. SULU,
YOU AND CAPTAIN
CHRISTOPHER

591
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,066
WILL BEAM DOWN
WITH ME.

592
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,651
THE CAPTAIN WILL PROVIDE
THE COORDINATES

593
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,194
FOR THE TRANSPORTER CHIEF.

594
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,196
SHALL I ISSUE
PHASERS?

595
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,574
ONE FOR YOU, ONE FOR ME.
SET THEM ON
HEAVY STUN FORCE.

596
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,118
YES, SIR.

597
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,960
YOU DON'T TRUST ME,
SPOCK.

598
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,507
IN FACT, I DO...

599
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,801
BUT ONLY
TO A CERTAIN POINT.

600
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,523
ENERGIZE.

601
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,248
DO THEY DO THAT
ALL THE TIME?

602
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,543
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

603
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,669
UH-HUH.

604
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,838
WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE?

605
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,132
MAYBE SOME
CHICKEN SOUP.

606
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,366
IT IS.

607
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,095
JUST A MINUTE, SIR.

608
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,596
HOLD IT.

609
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,227
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

610
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,562
SEE WHAT THAT IS,
AIRMAN.

611
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,538
DON'T YOU FIND THAT
PAINFUL, CAPTAIN?

612
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,791
YES, I DO.
WHAT'S HE
DOING HERE?

613
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,918
HE KNEW THE EXACT
BEAM DOWN COORDINATES FOR
THIS SECTION OF THE BASE.

614
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,753
IT WAS NECESSARY
TO BRING HIM ALONG.

615
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,673
I SEE. WELL,
NO HARM DONE.

616
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,049
Kirk: MR. SULU, DID YOU
HAVE A CHANCE TO
CHECK OUT THOSE TAPES?

617
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,176
MR. SPOCK
RAN THEM THROUGH
OUR COMPUTERS.

618
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,177
THEY WERE
THE RIGHT ONES.

619
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,636
GOOD.
WE GOT THEM ALL.

620
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,013
THEY KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN HERE.

621
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,056
ALL THEY HAVE IS A MYSTERY
AND NO ANSWERS.

622
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,891
MR. SULU, SIGNAL
THE TRANSPORTER CHIEF.

623
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,310
FOUR TO BEAM UP.

624
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,895
UH-UH. NOT ME.

625
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,661
DON'T BE A FOOL.

626
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,955
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S AT STAKE.

627
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,540
YOU BET I DO--

628
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,501
MY FAMILY.
A SON THAT ISN'T
BORN YET.

629
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,838
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
RETURN ME NOW,
CAPTAIN.

630
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,175
SPOCK,
COME OUT OF THERE.

631
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,426
YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN
YOUR PRESENCE ON
THE BASE.

632
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,971
I TOLD YOU,
IT'S MY DUTY TO REPORT
EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN.

633
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,974
THAT'S EXPLANATION
ENOUGH.

634
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,475
SPOCK!

635
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,478
YOU'LL GO HOME,
CHRISTOPHER...

636
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,939
BUT YOU'LL DO IT
OUR WAY.

637
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,566
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

638
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,615
I SUSPECTED
HE MIGHT NOT WISH
TO RETURN WITH US.

639
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,661
FOUR TO BEAM UP,
MR. SULU.

640
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,872
YES, SIR.

641
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:20,043
CAPTAIN'S LOG,
STARDATE 3114.1.

642
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,503
WE MUST MAKE AN ATTEMPT
TO BREAK FREE OF THIS TIME,

643
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,589
OR WE AND OUR
RELUCTANT PASSENGERS

644
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:25,924
WILL REMAIN ITS PRISONERS.

645
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,009
ALL WE HAVE IS A THEORY

646
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,220
AND A FEW FACTS.

647
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,305
MR. SCOTT AND I
BOTH AGREE

648
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,223
THAT THE ONLY
POSSIBLE SOLUTION

649
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,183
IS THE SLINGSHOT
EFFECT,

650
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,018
LIKE THE ONE
THAT PUT US HERE.

651
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,353
MY COMPUTATIONS INDICATE

652
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,813
THAT IF WE FLY
TOWARD THE SUN,

653
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,315
SEEK OUT ITS
MAGNETIC ATTRACTION,

654
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,193
THEN PULL AWAY
AT FULL POWER,

655
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,529
THE WHIPLASH
WILL PROPEL US INTO
ANOTHER TIME WARP.

656
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,782
SLINGSHOT EFFECTS
ARE FINE FOR YOU PEOPLE.

657
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,909
HOW DO YOU
PROPOSE TO RETURN
THE SERGEANT AND ME?

658
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:58,539
LOGICALLY,
AS WE MOVE FASTER
AND FASTER TOWARD THE SUN,

659
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,293
WE'LL BEGIN TO MOVE
BACKWARD IN TIME.

660
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:03,962
WE'LL ACTUALLY GO BACK
BEYOND YESTERDAY,

661
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,215
BEYOND THE POINT
WHEN WE FIRST APPEARED
IN THE SKY.

662
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,303
THEN, BREAKING FREE
WILL SHOOT US
FORWARD IN TIME,

663
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:14,472
AND WE'LL TRANSPORT YOU
BACK AT A POINT BEFORE
ANY OF THIS HAPPENED.

664
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,808
YOU WON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO REMEMBER

665
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,393
BECAUSE IT NEVER
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

666
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,270
WHAT IF YOU
CAN'T PULL FREE
OF THE SUN?

667
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,313
OH, WE'LL DO THAT
ALL RIGHT, CAPTAIN.

668
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:23,522
WE'LL NOT BE
GETTING SO CLOSE

669
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,483
THAT MY ENGINES
COULDN'T PULL US OUT.

670
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,444
WHAT I AM WORRIED
ABOUT, SIR--

671
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,988
THAT WE MAY NOT
HAVE MUCH CONTROL

672
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:30,947
WHEN WE'RE THROWN
FORWARD AGAIN.

673
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,782
HELM CONTROL?

674
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,827
BRAKING CONTROL, SIR.
IF I CAN'T STOP US
SOON ENOUGH,

675
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,121
WE MAY OVERSHOOT
OUR TIME,

676
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,248
AND IF I STOP
THE ENGINES SUDDENLY,

677
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,126
THE STRAIN MAY
TEAR US APART.

678
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,587
ANY WAY WE DO IT,
IT MEANS A MIGHTY ROUGH RIDE.

679
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,678
WELL, GENTLEMEN,
WE ALL HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE--

680
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,097
ESPECIALLY
IF ONE IS ALL YOU HAVE.

681
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,891
ASSUME YOUR
STATIONS.

682
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,949
Man on radio:
AFFIRMATIVE.

683
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,409

MR. SULU.

687
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,713
WARP FACTOR 3, SIR.

688
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,387
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D
MAKE IT INTO SPACE.

689
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:39,098
I WAS IN LINE
TO BE CHOSEN FOR
THE SPACE PROGRAM,

690
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,059
BUT I DIDN'T QUALIFY.

691
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,561
TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AROUND, CAPTAIN.

692
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,563
YOU MADE IT HERE
AHEAD OF ALL OF THEM.

693
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,536
SIR, OUR SPEED
IS INCREASING.

694
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,828
WE'RE TRAVELING

WARP 8.

695
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,247
MR. SPOCK.

696
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:04,457
SINCE WE'VE PASSED
MERCURY,

697
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,751
THE SUN'S PULL ON US
HAS INCREASED GREATLY.

698
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,503
FROM HERE,
WE'LL MOVE EVEN FASTER.

699
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,671
AND, CAPTAIN,
NOTICE THE CHRONOMETERS.

700
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,048
THEY'VE STARTED
BACKWARD.

701
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,675
MINUTE BY MINUTE,

702
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,512
THE SPEED
OF TIME PASSAGE
WILL NOW INCREASE.

703
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,475
GET YOUR GEAR.
REPORT TO THE
TRANSPORTER ROOM.

704
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,851
AND, CAPTAIN
CHRISTOPHER,

705
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,063
YOU ONLY HAVE
ABOUT 15 YEARS,
SO YOU'D BETTER HURRY.

706
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,200
APPROACHING
BREAKAWAY POINT.

707
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,119
ON THE COUNTDOWN.

708
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,745

709
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,622

FIGHTING IT.

716
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,763
Man on radio: ...POINT 5
HERE. CAN WE CONFIRM?

717
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,682
GRAVITY IS DOWN
TO POINT 8.

718
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,643
WE'VE BROKEN FREE
AND HEADING BACK.

719
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,685
GAINING SPEED NOW,
CAPTAIN.

720
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,228
WE'RE NOW AT WARP 4.

721
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,022
WARP 7.

722
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,191
8.

723
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,733
OFF THE DIAL, SIR.

724
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,945
CHRONOMETER
IS MOVING FORWARD
AGAIN, CAPTAIN.

725
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,197
YOU HAVE
THE CHRONOMETER READING

726
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,949
AND THE COORDINATES TO
RETURN CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER
AND THE GUARD?

727
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,118
COMPUTED.

728
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,621
BRIDGE TO TRANSPORTER ROOM.
CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER.

729
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,668
THIS IS CHRISTOPHER.

730
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,878
WE'RE COMING UP
ON EARTH FAST, CAPTAIN.
ARE YOU READY?

731
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,004
EVERYTHING A-OK.

732
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,799
UH, CAPTAIN...

733
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,510
THANKS FOR
THE LOOK AHEAD.

734
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:24,430
OUR PLEASURE,
CAPTAIN.
BRIDGE OUT.

735
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,857
20 MINUTES, SIR.
IT'LL BE CLOSE.

736
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,652
BRIDGE TO TRANSPORTER ROOM.

737
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,986
PREPARE TO ENERGIZE.

738
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:42,114
10 MINUTES.

739
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,740

740
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,783

741
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,160

3...2...

745
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,957
ENERGIZE.

746
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:56,170
Blackjack:
YOU SHOULD BE
CLOSE ENOUGH

747
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,506
FOR A VISUAL CONTACT.

748
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,735
BLUEJAY 4.
CAN YOU SEE IT?

749
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,904
WHAT IS IT?

750
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,616
BLUEJAY 4. COME IN.
WE'VE LOST THE IMAGE.

751
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,705
BLACKJACK,
THIS IS BLUEJAY 4.

752
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:34,125
I COULD HAVE SWORN
THERE WAS SOME KIND
OF SHIP, BUT...

753
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,793
NOTHING COULD HAVE
MOVED THAT FAST.

754
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,796
WE DON'T TRACK MIRAGES.

755
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,466
MARK IT DOWN
AS ANOTHER UFO.

756
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:43,760
BLUEJAY 4
RETURNING TO BASE.

757
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,177

758
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:47,388

00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,015
BRIDGE

760
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,808
PREPARE TO ENERGIZE.

761
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:53,686
NOW.

762
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,646
ENERGIZE.

763
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,469
PAST PLUTO, SIR.

764
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:28,346
WHAT'S OUR READING,
MR. SPOCK?

765
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,139
APPROACHING
OUR CENTURY, CAPTAIN.

766
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,350
BRAKING SHOULD BEGIN...

767
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:33,601
NOW.

768
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,479
BRIDGE TO ENGINEERING.

769
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,647
BEGIN FULL BRAKING POWER.

770
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:41,192
PULLING AWAY FROM THE SUN
WEAKENED THEM, SIR.

771
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,901
THEY MAY BLOW APART
IF I REVERSE.

772
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,821
NO CHOICE, MR. SCOTT.

773
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,698
AYE, SIR.

774
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,786
50 YEARS TO GO.

775
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,162
ENGINES CUTTING
BACK, SIR.

776
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,372
NO DECREASE
IN SPEED.

777
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,541

778
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,668
30...

779
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,378
NEVER MIND,
MR. SPOCK.

780
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,179
THE ENGINES!

781
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:24,736
ENGINE ROOM TO BRIDGE.

782
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:26,654
ENGINES ARE ON
FULL REVERSE,

783
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:28,614
AND THEY'RE BUCKLING!

784
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,618
BRIDGE!

785
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,372
MR. SCOTT

786
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,005
CAPTAIN.

787
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,550
