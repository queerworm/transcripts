1
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:04,417
Fletcher has more experience
with propulsion systems.

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:06,250
But Carstairs is
better with people.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,291
Considering this is
a supervisory position,

4
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,125
I'd go with her.

5
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,625
I guess you're right.

6
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,583
Didn't we just do crew
evaluation reports?

7
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:16,375
Three months ago.

8
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,125
Seems like three weeks.
(<i> yawns</i> )

9
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,959
Why don't we just
give everybody a promotion

10
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:24,125
and call it a night...
Commander?

11
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,834
Fine with me... Captain.

12
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:28,166
Could we have two coffees,
please?

13
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,625
(<i> Troi laughing</i> )

14
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,208
What could be
so funny?

15
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,375
I mean, what's so funny
about crew evaluations?

16
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,125
Don't worry
about it, Sam.

17
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,166
Can't we just try
and have a good time here?

18
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,792
How can I have a good time
when my career is being decided

19
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,834
across the room?

20
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,041
Come on. Think promotion.

21
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,250
Promotion, promotion,
promotion, promotion...

22
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,166
You can't really believe
that what you're doing

23
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,000
will influence the outcome
of your evaluation.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Promotion, promotion...

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,458
It's a time-honored
strategy, Taurik.

26
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,625
The Vedeks of the Janalan Order
maintain a round-the-clock chant

27
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,625
for the benefit
of the Bajoran people.

28
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:10,542
Considering the history
of your planet,

29
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,625
that doesn't exactly validate
what he's doing.

30
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,458
Promote me,<i> please,</i>

31
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:20,458
so I can make lieutenant
and have my own room.

32
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,709
If you are unhappy
sharing quarters with me,

33
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,500
then you should put in
for a new room assignment...

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,875
just in case
you're not promoted.

35
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,542
(<i> chuckling</i> )

36
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:36,500
I've been thinking
about who to promote to Ops.

37
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,875
The new
night duty officer?
Mm-hmm.

38
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,917
Lavelle is
an obvious candidate,

39
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:42,041
but I'm also considering
Ensign Sito.

40
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,083
Thank you.

41
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,083
You're welcome.

42
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,458
You sure about dessert?

43
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,667
Yes, don't tempt me.

44
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:59,041
So, are they working
on crew evaluations?
Yep.

45
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,667
Who are they
talking about?
It's not my place to say.

46
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,834
Come on, Ben.
Please.

47
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:07,667
All right, but I'm not sure
you two are going to like it.

48
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:11,333
Apparently, you two are up
for the same job.

49
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:49,333
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

50
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:53,375
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

51
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,250
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

55
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,625
Lock phasers on target.
Phasers locked.

56
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,041
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

57
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,291
The enemy is firing.
Helm, hard to starboard.

58
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,792
Hard to starboard.
Fire phasers.

59
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,500
Firing.

60
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,542
Target is destroyed.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,583
End simulation sequence.
Secure from drill.

62
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,709
Alpha shift,
your response time

63
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,917
was seven percent slower
than the Gamma shift.

64
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,792
All departments, submit
drill evaluation reports

65
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,041
by 0900 hours.

66
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,250
Ensign, you'll write
that report.

67
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,291
Yes, sir.

68
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,875
What happened back there,
Ensign?

69
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,917
I'm sorry, sir.
When we changed course,

70
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,041
I had to relock phasers
before I could fire.

71
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,417
Next time, try letting
the locking relay float

72
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:51,709
until the actual order
to fire is given.

73
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,000
They may not teach that trick
at the academy, but it works.

74
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,417
Thank you, sir.

75
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,208
Lavelle.
Sir?

76
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,959
Resume previous
course and speed.
Aye, aye, sir.

77
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,917
One "aye" is sufficient,
acknowledgment, Ensign.
(<i> door opens</i> )

78
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:10,083
Helm, change course for the
Argaya system, maximum warp.
LAVELLE: Aye, sir.

79
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,917
What happened to the
rendezvous with the<i> Clement?</i>

80
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:13,750
I've received new
orders from Starfleet.

81
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,375
We'll discuss it in
the Observation Lounge.

82
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,583
Mr. Data, Mr. Worf.

83
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,000
Ensign Sito,
take over at Ops.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,083
Yes, sir.

85
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:34,375
The Argaya system's close
to the Cardassian border.

86
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,041
I wonder why
we're going there.

87
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:41,166
How would you like to be
a spider under that table?

88
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,125
What?

89
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,000
A spider under the table.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,917
Is that like a fly
on the wall?

91
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:50,208
I guess so.

92
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,125
You did really well
during the drill.

93
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,792
Well, apparently
Commander Riker didn't think so.

94
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,291
I swear,
he's got it in for me.

95
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,041
You're imagining things.

96
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,709
Yeah?

97
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,625
Then how come you're sitting
in that chair instead of me?

98
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,417
I guess he figured I needed
more practice than you do.

99
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,458
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a minute?

100
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,291
Sure, Taurik.
What is it?

101
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,875
I'd like you to take
a look at something.

102
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,583
Have you been
improvising again, Ensign?

103
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,041
In a manner
of speaking.

104
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,750
I'm running
a computer simulation

105
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,166
to test a new warp-field
configuration.

106
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,375
You got a problem here.

107
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,583
Your plasma flow to
the nacelles is out of sync.

108
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,083
Actually, sir,
that was done deliberately.

109
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,834
As you can see,
this configuration

110
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:51,792
has increased overall
warp-field integrity

111
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,458
by seven percent.

112
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,875
You're right.

113
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,208
Dr. Nils Diaz
has been experimenting

114
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,750
with this technique at the
Tanaline Propulsion Laboratory.

115
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,375
Yeah, I'm familiar
with his work,

116
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,667
but I never heard
anything about this.

117
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,000
His findings have not
been released yet.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,041
I was able to review
a preliminary report

119
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,542
when I was
at the academy.

120
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:12,834
I look forward
to reading it.

121
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,500
I predict that when these
findings are made public,

122
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,208
they will become a new model
for warp-field operations.

123
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,208
Sounds interesting.

124
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,125
With your
permission, sir,

125
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,041
I'd like to begin tests
to see if the technique

126
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,333
can be adapted
to our warp drive.

127
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,917
There might be variables
that you didn't account for.

128
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,917
I was quite thorough.

129
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,625
I'm sure you were,
but I'd still need

130
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,125
to see your simulation
before I authorize any tests.

131
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,667
As you wish.

132
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,291
If you have any other ideas
for increasing efficiency,

133
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,000
don't hesitate
to run them by me.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,166
As a matter of fact,
sir, I do.

135
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,458
When would be a good time
to discuss them?

136
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,792
I'll get back to you on that.

137
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,208
Hmm.

138
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,625
(<i> clearing throat</i> )
Excuse me, Doctor.

139
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:12,000
If you're wondering
about the evaluations,

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,875
things couldn't be better.

141
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,917
Actually,
I just wanted to tell you

142
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:18,166
that Ensign Reilly's condition
is showing improvement,

143
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,417
but thank you.

144
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,917
In fact, I'm recommending you
for a promotion.

145
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:26,333
How does "Lieutenant
Alyssa Ogawa" sound?

146
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,250
It sounds wonderful.

147
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,667
I'll talk to Commander Riker,
and I'm sure it'll be official

148
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,834
as soon as the current
crew evaluations are over.

149
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, Alyssa...

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,750
how are things going between
you and Lieutenant Powell?

151
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,250
Fine... I think.

152
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,083
You think?

153
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,917
I'm sure it's nothing,

154
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:49,750
but he seems
preoccupied lately.

155
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,208
Last night,
he had to cancel our date.
I see.

156
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,333
He's been putting together
a research proposal.

157
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,333
He's been
really busy with it.

158
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,542
Well, I know what
that's like.

159
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:03,875
Sometimes I get so busy
with research, I forget to eat.

160
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,917
I just wonder...

161
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,333
What? Sit down.

162
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,959
I've never met
anyone like Andrew.

163
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,583
It's as though we've known
each other forever.

164
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,417
You do seem very well suited.

165
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:25,792
But...

166
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:29,500
I know that in
the beginning of a romance,

167
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,959
it's possible to be
a little blind.

168
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,625
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

169
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,125
Well... canceling
a date like that...

170
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,750
the way he's been
so distant lately...

171
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,583
Doctor, do you think
those could be warning signs

172
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,709
that he's losing interest?

173
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:50,333
Alyssa, I think
you're overreacting.

174
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,750
Maybe so.

175
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,542
If I cared about someone as much
as you care about Andrew,

176
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,917
he'd have to do a lot more
than cancel a date

177
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,917
before I'd get suspicious.

178
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,583
You're right.

179
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sure that
when this research is over,

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,041
things will be back
just the way they were.

181
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,166
Except, of course,
that he'll have to deal

182
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,083
with<i> Lieutenant</i> Ogawa.

183
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,500
Hmm.

184
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,208
I only filled in at Ops
for a half hour,

185
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,333
but I had to degauss
the main deflector dish,

186
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,500
recalibrate
the navigation grid

187
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,125
<i>and</i> use internal sensors
to find a lost puppy.

188
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,417
Ops is a very different
challenge from Tactical.

189
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,667
I can't figure out why
I'm even being considered

190
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,041
for this assignment.

191
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,375
I'm a security officer.

192
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,834
I recommended you.

193
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,917
I'll try not to
let you down, sir.

194
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:55,333
What could they
be talking about?

195
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,875
Have you ever considered
learning to lip-read?

196
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,792
You think Worf's
chewing her out?

197
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,792
No, he always
looks like that.

198
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:06,125
Maybe he's giving her pointers
on how to land the Ops position.

199
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,417
Hi, Will.
Ben. How you doing?

200
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,959
You call him Will?
BEN: Why not?

201
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:14,083
He's second-in-command
of this ship, that's why not.

202
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,583
I'm not Starfleet--
I'm a civilian.

203
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,458
When he's in here, he wants
to be treated like a civilian.

204
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,166
Riker? I bet he sleeps
in his uniform.

205
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,125
BEN: You only think that
because he's your C.O.

206
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,667
If you got to know him...
Right.

207
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,625
He's convinced Commander Riker
doesn't like him.

208
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,208
Why? Did you crash the ship
into something?

209
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,291
No, he just doesn't like me.
He doesn't even know you.

210
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,583
That's right.
You should go talk to him.

211
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,917
About what?

212
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,625
Perhaps something
you have in common.

213
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,875
He likes jazz, poker,
he's Canadian...

214
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,208
Yeah?

215
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,875
My grandfather
was from Canada.

216
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,417
BEN:
There you go.

217
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,500
Hi.
Excuse me.

218
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,834
I got to go talk to somebody.

219
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,375
Good evening, sir.

220
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,417
Lavelle.

221
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,583
Something I can
do for you?

222
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,792
No, sir, I just came
to get another drink.

223
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,333
Is there something wrong
with that one?

224
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:19,667
No. Actually, I...
what are you having?
Trakian ale.

225
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,000
Good choice.
I'll have one, too.

226
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:27,208
My grandfather
was Canadian, you know.
Really?

227
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,375
Aren't you one, too?
A grandfather?

228
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,625
No. Canadian, sir,
Canadian.

229
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,500
No, I grew up in Alaska.

230
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,375
Oh.

231
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:42,083
Well... they both...
get a lot of snow.

232
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,917
Yeah.

233
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,291
It was good
talking to you, sir.

234
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,083
Yeah.

235
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,041
Your ale, Ensign...

236
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:04,166
We're holding position
in the Argaya system.

237
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,500
Anything?
No, sir.

238
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,125
I detect no vessels
in the vicinity.

239
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,417
How close to the Cardassian
border are we?

240
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,875
Less than
5,000 kilometers, sir.

241
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,875
Sir,
I'm detecting an object

242
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,041
five meters in length.

243
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,750
It appears to be
an escape pod.

244
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,000
They must have been forced
to abandon the ship.

245
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,375
How far inside
Cardassian space is it?

246
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,417
WORF:
50,000 kilometers.

247
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:30,250
How the hell are we going
to get it out of there?

248
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,041
Sir, the pod's life-support
system is failing.

249
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,542
RIKER:
Notify, Dr. Crusher.

250
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,166
PICARD: Can we get within
transporter range

251
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,959
without crossing
into Cardassian territory?

252
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,667
We would need to
boost the gain

253
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,000
in the confinement beam
by at least seven percent.

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,166
Mr. La Forge?

255
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,667
I'm on it, Captain.

256
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,041
There, try that.

257
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,625
The pod is still
too far away.

258
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,166
Okay, I'm going to try
augmenting the frequency spread.

259
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,041
Bioreadings indicate
passengers humanoid.

260
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,875
Attempting life-form
identification.

261
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,709
No one told you
to do that, Ensign.

262
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,041
Let's just get them
aboard safely.

263
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,208
There, that should do it.

264
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,333
Confinement beam's
at 109% of normal.

265
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,250
Transporter Room, you should be
able to get a lock now.

266
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,625
CREWMAN:
Aye, sir.

267
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,291
PICARD:
Dr. Crusher, are you ready?

268
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,333
Stand by.

269
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,583
Alyssa, I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave now.

270
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,667
All right, Doctor.

271
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,792
Transporter Room, go ahead.

272
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,458
CREWMAN:
Aye, sir.

273
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,542
What are you doing here?

274
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,417
I'm not supposed
to let anyone

275
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,041
but the senior officers
inside Sick Bay.

276
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,125
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

277
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,333
No. Do you?
I better go.

278
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,375
Ensign.
Sir.

279
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,375
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

280
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,375
1200 hours.

281
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,375
Alpha shift is relieved.

282
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,500
Excuse me, sir.

283
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,542
If you don't mind, I'd like
to stay on for another shift.

284
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:11,709
I could use the training.
Now's not the best time.

285
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,625
Yes, sir.

286
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,709
Ensign, you're with me.

287
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,208
Bridge.

288
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,625
You are a certified
pilot, Ensign?

289
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,709
Yes, sir.

290
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,750
How long have you served on
board the<i> Enterprise,</i> Ensign?

291
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,625
Seven months, sir.

292
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,834
I understand that
you've been recommended
for the Ops position.

293
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:13,125
Do you think
you're up to it?
I do, sir.

294
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,834
I'm not so sure.
I'm concerned about your record.

295
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,458
Sir?

296
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,417
The incident that you were
involved in at the academy.

297
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,583
With all due respect,
that was three years ago.

298
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,166
My record since then...
It doesn't matter
how long ago it was, Ensign.

299
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,041
Would you do something
like that again?

300
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,125
I can assure you, sir,

301
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,834
that I would never,

302
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:35,041
never jeopardize lives
by participating in...

303
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,583
In a daredevil stunt?

304
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,500
I would certainly hope not.

305
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,125
But what concerns me is that
you participated in a cover-up

306
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,667
that impeded
an official investigation

307
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,375
into the death of a cadet.

308
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,333
Sir, I know I should have
told the truth

309
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,792
right from the start...
Yes, you should,
but you didn't.

310
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,625
Instead, you joined
with the others

311
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:59,291
to pretend that that
was simply an accident.

312
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,917
Now, what do you think that
tells me about your character?

313
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,917
Sir, if you had any idea

314
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:09,750
what it was like
after that incident...

315
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,083
I didn't have any friends.

316
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,166
I didn't have anyone
to talk to.

317
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,417
I had to take my flight test
with the instructor

318
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:20,417
because no one else
would be my partner.

319
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,125
In a lot of ways,
it would have been easier

320
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,542
to just walk away,
but I didn't.

321
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,709
I stuck with it.

322
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:29,417
Doesn't that say something
about my character, too?

323
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:33,333
Well, I'm really very sorry
you didn't enjoy your time
at the academy, Ensign.

324
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,375
As far as I'm concerned,

325
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,375
you should have been expelled
for what you did.

326
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,917
Quite frankly,
I don't know

327
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:42,083
how you made it
on board this ship.

328
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,041
You're dismissed.

329
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,875
Another two seconds...

330
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,166
Okay, that's enough.

331
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,917
Sir, I'm a little puzzled.

332
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:11,542
Why are we intentionally
damaging the shuttlecraft?

333
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,417
We're evaluating
hull resiliency.

334
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,792
Starfleet requires
periodic testing.

335
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,792
I see.

336
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:23,083
I don't believe I'm familiar
with that requirement.

337
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:27,583
Probably because you're
not a senior officer.

338
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,667
If you wish,

339
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:33,583
I can reconfigure the phaser
to fire a low-intensity burst

340
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,542
that would not harm
the shuttle's hull.

341
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,792
The test procedure
would not be affected.

342
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,083
It's fine
just the way it is.

343
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,291
Now, give me another burst,
about four seconds...

344
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,875
right here.

345
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,959
Do you want me to fire
from this position?

346
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,000
Actually, why don't you
do it from over here?

347
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,375
That would be consistent.

348
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,667
Consistent with what?

349
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,625
With making it appear

350
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,291
that this shuttle
had fled an attack.

351
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,041
What makes you think
that's what we're doing?

352
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,959
The pattern of fire
you have asked for

353
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,583
is similar to
what might result

354
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,041
if the shuttle
had fled an attacker

355
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,250
while engaging
in evasive maneuvers.

356
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,667
It's an amazing coincidence.

357
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,709
Yes, sir, it is indeed.

358
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,959
Shall we proceed
with the testing?

359
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,709
Yes, Ensign.
Thank you.

360
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,208
Alyssa, thank you for
coming so quickly.

361
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,125
We have to prepare
for surgery.

362
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,000
We have a comatose patient
with a subdural hematoma.
Yes, sir.

363
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,834
I want to make it clear
that you are not to discuss

364
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,834
what you see here
with anyone.
I understand.

365
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,208
We'll need to synthesize
at least a liter

366
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,208
of Cardassian blood.

367
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,000
It's your bet, Taurik.

368
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,333
What I can't understand is
why we're just sitting here

369
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,500
so close to
the Cardassian border.

370
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,083
It must have something to do

371
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,166
with that escape pod
we picked up.

372
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,542
Don't you think, Sito?

373
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,125
Maybe.

374
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,000
I wonder who was in it.

375
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,375
You know what I heard?

376
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,125
It was Ambassador Spock.

377
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,709
That is most unlikely.

378
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:23,875
BEN:
That's what I was told.

379
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,458
By whom?
I can't say.

380
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,709
They beamed whoever was in it
straight to Sick Bay.

381
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:30,792
Did you see anything
when you were down there?

382
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:32,792
No.

383
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,667
Dr. Crusher just asked me
to help her

384
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,625
with the laboratory schedule.

385
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,000
I thought Lieutenant Powell
was going to join us tonight.

386
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,542
He had to do a double shift.

387
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,291
That's too bad.

388
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,417
He must be the worst
poker player I've ever met.

389
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:47,917
It's your bet, Sam.

390
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,583
Twenty.

391
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,792
The thing is, I saw Powell in
Ten-Forward with another woman,

392
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,917
and the way they were
talking, it made me wonder.

393
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:08,375
Well, if he's seeing someone
else, he should tell Alyssa.

394
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,750
I mean,
it might hurt her now,

395
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,834
but it would be better
in the long run.

396
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:14,500
I've been meaning to talk to
you about something, Mr. Worf.

397
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,166
I don't think Ensign Sito's
prepared for the Ops position.

398
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,250
Well, I must say
I disagree, sir.

399
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,875
Counselor,
pair of fours bets.

400
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,166
I'm listening.

401
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,917
BEN:
The bet is 50.

402
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,667
It would be illogical
for the captain

403
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:38,875
to deny you a promotion

404
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,750
for something you did
as a cadet.

405
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,667
He said it shows
I don't have character.

406
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,125
What did you say?

407
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,834
What could I say?

408
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,500
Maybe he's right.

409
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,750
Hey, you're
a damn fine officer

410
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,959
and you deserve that post
as much as anyone.

411
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:58,750
One thing's for sure,
I won't be getting it.

412
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,250
Not if it's up to Riker.

413
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,208
Well, it is
your decision, sir,

414
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,917
but I am certain
if you give Ensign Sito

415
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:06,458
a chance to prove herself,
she will not disappoint you.

416
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,667
Very well, I'll take her
under consideration.

417
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:11,291
Besides, I'm not
convinced about Lavelle.

418
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,583
Really? Why?

419
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,291
He's too eager to please.

420
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,125
He's always trying
to ingratiate himself to me.

421
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,917
Why assume he's doing that
to get the job?

422
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:22,166
Fifty.

423
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:25,500
Here's your 50,

424
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,250
and 100 more.

425
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,333
TROI:
I don't know.

426
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,291
It seems to me that you
and Lavelle are a lot alike.

427
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,083
What?!

428
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,667
We're not at all alike.

429
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,417
You're bluffing.

430
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,709
You think so?

431
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:43,041
Yes, and I'm not going

432
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,041
to let you
get away with it.

433
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,458
You know, Sam,
maybe you shouldn't
try so hard with Riker.

434
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,667
It doesn't matter
whether he likes you,

435
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:01,417
as long as he respects you.

436
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:03,875
And he must, otherwise
he would not be considering you

437
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,500
for the Ops position.

438
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,750
You're probably right.

439
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,792
Maybe I'm just telling myself
that he hates me

440
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:12,875
so that if I don't get promoted,
I'll have an excuse.

441
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,709
You in or not?

442
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:17,291
At this juncture,

443
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,709
the odds of my winning this hand
are less than 39 to one.

444
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,166
I fold.

445
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,792
Commander's flush
is still working.

446
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:30,000
No help, Worf.

447
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,583
(<i> Worf groans</i> )

448
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:34,458
Ooh, tens<i> and</i> deuces
for the Doctor,

449
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,750
and jacks and fours
for the Counselor.

450
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,166
Ah, three sixes.

451
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,834
Fold.

452
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:43,291
Looks like it's just
you and me.

453
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,208
You going to go another 50?

454
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,500
I'm thinking.
Give me a second here.

455
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,375
Didn't you tell me
that you took up poker

456
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,083
so you could be in the
officer's game at the<i> Potemkin?</i>

457
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,083
I happen to like poker.

458
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,959
But your senior officers
might have thought

459
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:01,250
that you were trying
to ingratiate yourself.

460
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,417
I guess it's lucky
that they realized

461
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:05,583
that you were young
and inexperienced

462
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,291
and decided not to hold it
against you.

463
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,542
Hmm.

464
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:13,417
Maybe I have been
a little hard on Lavelle.

465
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:18,917
I do not believe
he is bluffing.

466
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,667
I do.
Here you go.

467
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,250
What have you got?

468
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:28,166
Flush.
I cannot<i> believe</i> this!

469
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,083
I am your worst nightmare.

470
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,166
BEN:
I knew it.

471
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,834
How could you tell
I was bluffing?

472
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:38,250
You don't really expect me
to answer that, do you?

473
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,834
Look, it's getting late.

474
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:41,250
Maybe we should
all get some sleep.

475
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,250
One more hand.
Mm-mm.

476
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,083
Come on, Geordi,
you don't have to quit
just because I'm unbeatable.

477
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:49,083
No, there's something I need
to do down in Engineering.

478
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,041
I'll get you next time.

479
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,375
I'll be there.

480
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,583
Good night, everybody.

481
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,750
TROI AND DR. CRUSHER:
Good night.

482
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,083
Bye.

483
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,667
Good night.
OGAWA: See you later.

484
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:11,583
What I find curious is that
when Commander La Forge saw

485
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:14,291
that the technique I was using
was actually more efficient,

486
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:17,166
he seemed annoyed.
Of course he was.

487
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,709
He didn't like the fact that
you knew something he didn't.

488
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,291
Do you think that I have
irreparably damaged

489
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,625
my relationship with him?

490
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,959
Well, it depends
on what kind of a guy he is.

491
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,875
BEN:
Ante up, gentlemen.

492
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,792
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come in.

493
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:34,250
Commander...
As you were.

494
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,792
I dropped by to see Taurik.

495
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:37,709
What can I do
for you, sir?

496
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:39,000
Well, I'm headed
for Engineering

497
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,583
to run those tests
on the nacelles.

498
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,667
Since you've already put in
some work on the technique,

499
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,041
I thought you might like
to give me a hand.

500
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,500
I'd be pleased to, sir.

501
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,417
Great. Let's go.

502
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:58,542
How about some blackjack?

503
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:01,250
I've got to get some sleep,
so I can be sharp tomorrow.

504
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,417
Why? So you can get promoted,
have more responsibility

505
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:07,375
and have to get to sleep
even earlier?

506
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,875
Good night.

507
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,041
Come in.

508
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,750
DR. CRUSHER:
Ben, what are you doing here?

509
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,625
I just cleaned out
some junior officers

510
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,875
and I thought
I'd do the same here.

511
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:36,417
You're welcome
to give it a try.

512
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:38,291
Pull up a chair.
BEN: Thanks.

513
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,583
Dismissed.

514
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,875
Ensign Sito.

515
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,458
Yes, sir.

516
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,333
I also teach
an advanced class.

517
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,667
I believe you may be
ready to participate.

518
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,792
However, before
you can join the group,

519
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,917
you must pass
the<i> Gik'tal.</i>

520
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:06,542
<i>Gik'tal?</i> 
Yes.

521
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,959
It is a very ancient
Klingon ritual.

522
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:12,041
It tests your knowledge
of the forms of the<i> mok'bara.</i>

523
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,875
I should practice first.
No.

524
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,166
No practice.

525
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,083
That is part of the ritual.

526
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:20,375
The test must be
unannounced.

527
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:29,083
Can you see?
No.

528
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,542
Good.

529
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,750
The<i> Gik'tal</i> has begun.

530
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,375
Defend yourself!

531
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,333
You must anticipate
my attack.

532
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,709
Yes, sir.

533
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:55,291
Defend yourself!

534
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:11,959
(<i> groans</i> )

535
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:16,291
Are you listening, Ensign?

536
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:17,875
Yes, but...

537
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,709
Defend yourself.

538
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,458
Ow!

539
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,208
You did not anticipate.

540
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:43,917
How am I supposed
to defend myself

541
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,542
when I can't see a thing?

542
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,917
Stop making excuses.
Replace the blindfold.

543
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:49,000
No!

544
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,583
It's not a fair test.

545
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:54,166
Very good, Ensign.

546
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:57,667
You have passed
the challenge.

547
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:01,208
What? By taking off
the blindfold?

548
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:04,500
It takes courage to say
the test is unfair.

549
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,583
One thing
I don't understand.

550
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:12,625
Doesn't<i> Gik'tal</i> mean
"to the death"?

551
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,959
You speak Klingon.

552
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,542
Sir...

553
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:22,542
is there really such a thing
as a<i> Gik'tal</i> challenge?

554
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:25,041
No, there is not,

555
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:27,959
but perhaps next time
you are judged unfairly,

556
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:32,083
it will not take so many
bruises for you to protest.

557
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,291
All I've ever wanted
is to make a career for
myself in Starfleet.

558
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:47,917
I can't change what happened
at the academy-- no one can.

559
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:51,000
All I can do is work hard
and try to earn the respect

560
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,583
of the people
I serve with.

561
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,625
If you're not going to
give me that chance,

562
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:55,917
then I respectfully request

563
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:57,625
that you transfer me
to another ship.

564
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:59,959
If you're looking
for a more lenient commander,

565
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,667
I don't think
you'll find one.

566
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:06,333
Permission to speak
freely, sir?

567
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:12,375
Please do.

568
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,375
If you didn't want me
on your ship,

569
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:17,917
you should have said so
when I was assigned to it.

570
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:21,208
It's not your place
to punish me for what I did

571
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,959
at the academy.

572
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,291
I've worked hard here.

573
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,917
My record is exemplary.

574
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:29,375
If you're going to judge me,
judge me for what I am now.

575
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:33,959
Very well, Ensign, I will.

576
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:38,750
It took courage
to come here and face me

577
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,000
after what I said
to you the other day.

578
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,208
I didn't ask you here
because I was assessing

579
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,208
your qualifications
for the Ops position.

580
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,917
I don't understand, sir.

581
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:51,750
I was harsh with you
because I wanted to assess you

582
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,291
for a very
important mission--

583
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:57,667
a mission that could
put you in a situation

584
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:00,959
that would be far more
unnerving than a dressing down

585
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,375
by your commanding officer.

586
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,750
Can I ask what
that mission is, sir?

587
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,500
Join the senior officers

588
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,417
in the Observation
Lounge at 0900 hours.

589
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:08,917
We'll discuss it then.

590
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:11,583
Yes, sir.

591
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,542
And, Ensign...

592
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,667
I do know why you ended up
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

593
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,083
I asked for you.

594
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,417
I wanted to make
sure that you got

595
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,959
a fair chance
to redeem yourself.

596
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:31,000
Thank you, sir.

597
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:40,250
You wanted
to see me, Doctor?

598
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,458
Yes.

599
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:44,542
Alyssa,
I think you know

600
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:47,709
how much I've come
to depend upon you here.

601
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,709
I've recommended
your promotion

602
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:52,959
because your performance
here has been exemplary.

603
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:55,250
Thank you, Doctor.
I appreciate that.

604
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,291
But more than that...

605
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,041
I've come to
think of you as a friend,

606
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,333
someone I really
care about.

607
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,250
It's nice of you
to say that.

608
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,792
I feel the same way.

609
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:12,667
So...

610
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:16,000
you and Andrew Powell...?

611
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,709
Someone told you.
Told me what?

612
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:20,542
We were going
to keep it a secret

613
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,208
until the promotions
are announced.

614
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,208
A secret?

615
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,542
He asked me to marry him.

616
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,875
Alyssa, that's wonderful.

617
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:29,667
I'm so relieved...
I mean happy.

618
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:38,166
Please.
Take a seat, Ensign.

619
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,917
This is Joret Dal.

620
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:53,500
He was in the escape pod
that we retrieved.

621
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,875
He is a member of
the Cardassian military

622
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,458
and a Federation operative.

623
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:01,417
He has risked his life

624
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,792
to bring us
invaluable information

625
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:06,417
about Cardassian
strategic intentions.

626
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,709
Information that could
very well

627
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,125
enhance the security
of Bajor,

628
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:13,083
as well as other planets
in this sector.

629
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,667
Now, it is
absolutely imperative

630
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:18,583
that we return him safely
to Cardassian space.

631
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:19,917
It will not be easy.

632
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:22,417
The border is
heavily guarded.

633
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,375
Since his ship was destroyed,
he'll be using one
of our shuttles.

634
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:28,458
If a patrol stops me,
I will claim to have stolen it.

635
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,875
We have distressed
the shuttle

636
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,959
so that it appears
to have been fired upon.

637
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:35,208
Joret will attempt to talk
his way past the patrol.

638
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:39,333
If I were alone, the chances
of my succeeding would be slim,

639
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,709
but if I had
a prisoner with me,

640
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,500
a Bajoran terrorist,

641
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,166
I would appear to
be a bounty hunter.

642
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,875
Border crossings of that
nature are not uncommon.

643
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:51,417
And for a price,
the patrol can be convinced

644
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:52,834
to look the other way.

645
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:55,583
Once the shuttle
is safely past the patrol,

646
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,792
Joret will put you
into an escape pod

647
00:33:57,792 --> 00:34:00,000
and return you back
across the border.

648
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,125
Since the pod is so small,
it will be difficult to detect.

649
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,625
We'll be waiting here
to pick you up.

650
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,709
I understand, sir.

651
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:09,667
Ensign, this is obviously
a very dangerous mission.

652
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:12,709
I am not ordering you
to take part in it.

653
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:16,000
Then I volunteer, sir.

654
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,917
Be certain you understand
the risk you are taking.

655
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:22,959
If you are captured...
I'm Bajoran.

656
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:26,709
No one knows better than I do
what Cardassians do

657
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:29,417
to their prisoners.

658
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:32,750
I've made my decision.

659
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,542
Very well, Ensign.

660
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:38,375
Will you report to Sick Bay?
Dr. Crusher will explain.

661
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:42,834
And, Ensign Sito,
I must ask you

662
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:45,250
not to discuss
this mission with anyone.

663
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,333
Yes, sir.

664
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:02,333
I didn't realize
she would be so young.

665
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,083
(<i> door opens</i> )

666
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,667
The captain
asked Dr. Crusher

667
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:24,792
to make it look like
Joret had mistreated me.

668
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,458
We're all set here.

669
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,667
Sir?

670
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:40,291
I just want you to know
that I really appreciate

671
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:43,250
the fact that you've always
had confidence in me.

672
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,500
Good luck.

673
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
I'll see you soon.

674
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,458
We're approaching
the border.

675
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:28,166
It won't be long
before we're detected

676
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,875
by the patrol ships.

677
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,458
When they stop us,
do you want me to say anything?

678
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:39,208
No, it should seem
that I've broken your will.

679
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,208
If you're asked
any questions,

680
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:44,041
look at me as though
you're afraid to answer.

681
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,458
Can I ask you something?

682
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,625
Why are you doing this--

683
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,875
risking your life
for Starfleet?

684
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:56,041
I don't consider
myself a traitor

685
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,542
if that's what you're asking.

686
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:00,625
All my life,
I've served in the military.

687
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,542
Once, it was an institution

688
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:05,000
dedicated to the security
of Cardassia.

689
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,792
Now, it's little more
than a platform

690
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,333
for ambitious guls

691
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,667
hoping to make their
reputations in battle.

692
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,583
If the information
I've provided

693
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:16,417
helps Starfleet deter
even one pointless skirmish,

694
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:18,792
I've served my purpose.

695
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,875
I'm sick of war.

696
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,917
My people need peace.

697
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,542
I never thought
I'd hear a Cardassian

698
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:31,208
say something like that.

699
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,667
And I never thought
a Bajoran would risk her life

700
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,542
to help a Cardassian
get home.

701
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:39,667
(<i> beeping</i> )

702
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:43,375
A patrol ship's moving in
on our position.

703
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,709
We don't have
much time.

704
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:03,000
She must have left
on that shuttle.

705
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,583
There's no other
explanation.

706
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,208
Do you have any idea
where it went?

707
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,333
Toward Cardassian space.

708
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:08,792
That's what
I'm worried about.

709
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:10,125
Oh, there was
one other thing--

710
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,875
I noticed the shuttle
was damaged...

711
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,041
Sam, can we talk
about something else?

712
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,500
Well, don't you care
what's happened to her?
Of course.

713
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,667
But we have to accept the fact
that we're not always told

714
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:22,000
about everything
that happens aboard ship.

715
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,750
Well, we can at least tell
each other what we know.

716
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,417
Wait a minute.
Do you two know something?

717
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:34,250
Sam, please.

718
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,041
Oh, I can't believe this.
We're friends!

719
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:39,291
We're also
Starfleet officers.

720
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:42,125
I'm not allowed
to talk about it.

721
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,625
Okay.

722
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:47,291
I understand.

723
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:50,917
I better get going.

724
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:53,542
I got duty
in a half an hour.

725
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:01,291
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47566.7:</i>

726
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:04,500
<i>We have reached the coordinates</i>
<i>in Federation space</i>

727
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,834
<i>where Ensign Sito's</i>
<i>escape pod</i>

728
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,959
<i>was to have</i>
<i>rendezvoused with us.</i>

729
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,917
<i>However, we have been</i>
<i>waiting for over 30 hours,</i>

730
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,792
<i>and as yet,</i>
<i>there is no sign of her.</i>

731
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,500
Report.

732
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,417
We've completed a long-range
scan of the area, sir.

733
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:22,917
The escape pod doesn't
seem to be out there.

734
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,834
It is possible
that at this distance,

735
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:26,625
we are unable
to distinguish the pod

736
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,291
from the inorganic matter
normally present in space.

737
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,083
Try narrowing
the scan field.

738
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:33,250
See if you can pick up
any biosigns.

739
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,041
Sir, it would help if I knew

740
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:37,083
what kind of life signs
to look for.

741
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,291
You're scanning
for Bajoran life signs.

742
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:42,667
Yes, sir.

743
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:46,917
Nothing yet.

744
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,291
The pod is 32 hours overdue.

745
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,709
Sir, I recommend
we launch a probe

746
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:55,083
to increase the range
of our sensor sweeps.

747
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:58,542
Launching a probe
into Cardassian space

748
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:00,875
would be
a treaty violation.

749
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:06,000
Mr. Worf,
prepare a probe

750
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,166
and launch when ready.
Aye, sir.

751
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:15,125
WORF:
Probe launched, sir.

752
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,333
(<i> console beeping</i> )

753
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,709
Sir, I am detecting
signs of debris

754
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:27,041
200,000 kilometers
inside Cardassian space.

755
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,208
Its mass and composition
indicate

756
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:32,250
it could be the remains
of a Federation escape pod.

757
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:43,583
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

758
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:45,959
<i>We have intercepted</i>
<i>a Cardassian report</i>

759
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:49,000
<i>stating that a Bajoran</i>
<i>prisoner escaped her captor</i>

760
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,709
<i>and was killed</i>
<i>in an evacuation pod</i>

761
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:55,875
<i>as she tried to leave</i>
<i>Cardassian space.</i>

762
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,583
(<i> bosun's whistle sounds</i> )

763
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:09,291
To all Starfleet personnel,
this is the Captain.

764
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:12,458
It is my sad duty
to inform you

765
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,959
that a member of the crew,
Ensign Sito Jaxa,

766
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:19,208
has been lost
in the line of duty.

767
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:23,625
She was the finest example
of a Starfleet officer

768
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:27,000
and a young woman
of remarkable courage

769
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,542
and strength of character.

770
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:34,834
Her loss will be deeply felt
by all who knew her.

771
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,834
Picard out.

772
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,834
You okay?
Uh-huh.

773
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,333
(<i> sighs</i> )

774
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,333
LAVELLE:
I just got promoted.

775
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,417
Congratulations.

776
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,500
Thanks.

777
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,667
It just doesn't feel right.

778
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:28,959
For all I know,

779
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:31,750
she was going to get
the promotion instead of me.

780
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,333
You shouldn't
feel that way, Sam.

781
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,959
She would have been
happy for you, Sam.

782
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:38,333
The best way to remember her

783
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:41,750
would be to excel
in your new position.

784
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:48,667
We're proud of you, Sam.

785
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:56,792
Excuse me, sir, but I need
to move this table.

786
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,834
What?

787
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,667
There's an empty seat
over there.

788
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,625
I appreciate
what you are trying to do,

789
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:14,166
but it is not appropriate.

790
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:16,291
You were her friends.

791
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:18,709
I was only
her commanding officer.

792
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:23,083
Sir, I happen to know that
she considered you a friend.
