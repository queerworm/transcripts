00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,250
Commander, is it
your intention

2
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,709
to continue
to grow your beard?

3
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:20,083
Actually, I...
I'm not sure yet.

4
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,375
Why, Worf?

5
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,458
I was just asking.

6
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,834
Seven card stud,
one-eyed jacks are wild.

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,917
Frankly, Geordi,
I like the beard.

8
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,208
Thank you, Commander.

9
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:38,875
You know, I have always been
a little suspicious

10
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,375
of men in beards.

11
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:42,834
And why is that?

12
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't know, it's as if

13
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,375
they're trying to
hide something.

14
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,834
Hide?
Don't be ridiculous, Doctor.

15
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,083
The beard is an ancient
and proud tradition.

16
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,750
Mmm.
Some of the most

17
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:53,625
distinguished men in history
have worn beards, Doctor.

18
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,959
I know, but after the
razor was invented,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,917
I think beards became
mostly a fashion statement.

20
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,417
I'm not concerned with fashion.

21
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:05,291
To a Klingon, a beard
is a symbol of courage.

22
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,959
Mmm.
I think it's a sign of strength.

23
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:11,875
Sure, and, of course,
women can't grow beards.

24
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:13,834
Doctor, it sounds to me
like you feel that beards

25
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,500
are nothing more
than an affectation.

26
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,667
I do.

27
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:19,458
But there's nothing
wrong with that.

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,250
I mean, women wear makeup
and nail polish.

29
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,750
I just think it's time
that you men admit it.

30
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,625
My beard is not
an affectation.

31
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:30,333
Oh. Well, then you wouldn't
mind shaving it off.

32
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,959
I could lose it in a minute.
I've just gotten used to it.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,709
Okay, then why don't we
up the stakes a little,

34
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,792
and if I win, all of you
shave your beards off.

35
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,959
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

36
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,542
What if you lose?
What are you gonna give up?

37
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,333
I'm open for suggestions.

38
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,834
Well, I've always wanted to
see you as a brunette.

39
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,375
Oh, I did that
once when I was 13.

40
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:56,250
I couldn't change it
back fast enough.

41
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,333
Makes me even more curious.

42
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,000
(<i> laughing</i> )

43
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:05,709
Fine. If one of you wins,
I'll become a brunette.

44
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,041

45
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,375

Yeah.

46
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,333
Yeah, we'll take that bet.

47
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,166
Hm.

48
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,333
Looks like you have the
hand to beat, Commander.

49
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,041

52
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:26,250
Ah.

00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,542
Wait.

57

I'm sorry. You heard
the captain-- duty calls.

58
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:38,291

<i>to evaluate the situation.</i>

69
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,250
Dr. Farallon,
the original plans

70
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,875
called for the particle
fountain to lift

71
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:17,458
500 kilograms per minute
from the planet's surface.

72
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,834
Now, so far, we haven't
even come close to that.

73
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,667
Well, that's why I want to
increase the stream density.

74
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,417
That should boost the
lift capacity by 72%.

75
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, but you realize,
of course, you're gonna be

76
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,000
overloading the field
generators in the process.

77
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,375
Not if we distribute
the overload evenly

78
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,917
throughout the system.

79
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,834
Doctor, forgive me, but maybe
we should concentrate

80
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,291
on completing this
phase of the project

81
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,333
before we start talking
about redesigning it.

82
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:42,375
Commander, I know you're here
to evaluate this project.

83
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:45,375
Starfleet is considering
using a particle fountain

84
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:46,709
on Carema III.

85
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,208
They wanna know
how feasible it is.

86
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,208
And will your opinion
be the deciding factor?

87
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,166
No, not really.

88
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,959
I'll make my report
to Captain Picard.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He'll make the official
recommendation to Starfleet.

90
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,250
They'll decide.

91
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,792
Well, what's your
feelings so far?

92
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,125
Well, it seems to me
the question

93
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,792
we need to
be asking is,

94
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,750
is this technology
more efficient

95
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:06,417
than conventional
mining techniques?

96
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,959
Commander, I know
we've had problems here.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,291
It seems like nothing's
gone right.

98
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,125
It's taking a lot
longer than I thought

99
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,000
to get the particle stream
to full strength,

100
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,083
but I know it can work.

101
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,625
This is the direction
that mining

102
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:20,917
is going to take in the future,

103
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,542
and it should be
implemented on Carema III.

104
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:28,041
I know this can be
<i>potentially</i> very exciting.

105
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,583
All right...

00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,959
something that might help us

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,667
complete this project
more quickly.

I'm sorry, Doctor,
I think

122
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,250
we're gonna have
to shut it down.

123
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,458
It took four months to get

124
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,041
the particle flux
up to this level.

125
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,959
If we shut it down,
it'll take another four months

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,125
just to get it back.

127
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,583
Look, we've got less
than five minutes

128
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,417
before we lose containment.
When that happens,

129
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,166
the particle stream is gonna
flood this entire station.

130
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,625
We're gonna have to
shut it down then anyway.

131
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,208
Then we'll just have
to fix the power grid.

132
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,333
Yeah, but how
do we do that?

133
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,417
The defective grid is
200 meters down conduit A-2.

134
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,709
We have to disassemble four
bulkheads just to get to it.

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,458
Mr. Data, I was hoping I'd
have a chance to meet you.

177
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,375
I've done extensive studies
of your positronic network.

178
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,792
And I have studied your design
for the particle fountain.

179
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:07,041
I find the concept to
be highly innovative.

180
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,291
Thank you.

181
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,667
I am curious
how you were able

182
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,125
to repair the power
grid so quickly.

183
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,875
This should make it
clear, Commander.

184
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:16,250
Why don't we set it up
in Engineering?

185
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,959
Is it true that your
computational speed

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,875
is limited only by
the physical separation

187
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:22,458
of your positronic links?

188
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,250
DATA: Actually, that is
no longer the case.

189
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,959
I have recently converted
my interlink sequencer

190
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,625
to asynchronous operation,

191
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,333
which removed the
performance constraint.

192
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,166
Doctor... this way, please.

193
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,417
I see, but how
did you resolve

194
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,875
the signal fragmentation?

195
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:38,667
The interlink sequencer
is now bi-directional.

196
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:41,375
It compensates for the
asynchronous mode distortion

197
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:42,542
arising from the
resonant field.

198
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,959
Yes.
That's fascinating.

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,458
Does the sequencer require
any buffering system

200
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,333
to eliminate interference
from the positronic matrix?

201
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,083
FARALLON: We've been
using devices like this

202
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,792
on Tyrus VII for years.

203
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:58,834
The basic unit is a common
industrial servomechanism.

204
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,500
A few years ago, I started
tinkering with one.

205
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,625
This is the result.

206
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,291
Boridium power converter.

207
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,667
Axionic chip network.
That's very impressive.

208
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,667
You know, in terms of
sheer computational speed,

209
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,959
this little guy might be able
to compete with you, Data.

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,458
Oh, the exocomps
don't come close

211
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,917
to Data's sophistication.

212
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,083
Exocomps?

213
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,250
That's what
I call them.

214
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:26,083
Let's say you had an
anti-matter flow converter

215
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,166
that was fluctuating.

216
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,875
How would you repair it?

217
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:33,250
The correct procedure would
be to adjust the converter.

218
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,417
With what?
A mode stabilizer.

219
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:40,125
Okay, let me input the
problem into the exocomp.

220
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,417
A fluctuating anti-matter
flow converter.

221
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,542
Now, let's see what happens.

222
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,917
LA FORGE:
A mode stabilizer.

223
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,500
Very nice.

224
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,959
You have incorporated a
micro-replication system

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
into the device in order
to fashion tools.

226
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,834
It's more than that.

227
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,709
I designed the exocomps
to be problem solvers.

228
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,250
Whenever they
perform a task

229
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,333
they've never done before,
the micro-replicator

230
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,625
creates new circuit pathways
within the unit's memory.

231
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,375
So, in a sense,
they are learning.

232
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,667
FARALLON:
Exactly.

233
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:20,041
The more situations
they encounter,

234
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,208
the more circuit
pathways they build.

235
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,166
They become better
tools as they work.

236
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,083
It's very impressive technology,
that's for sure.

237
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,500
Once it's out of
the experimental stage,

238
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,125
there'll be plenty
of applications.

239
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,959
Commander, I'm hoping the
experimental stage is over.

240
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,917
When are we supposed
to brief Captain Picard

241
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,542
on the status of the
particle fountain?

242
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,792
1600 hours.

243
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:43,625
Good.
I'll have a proposal to make.

244
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,542
Captain, I know you're
supposed to give

245
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,709
your evaluation
to Starfleet today.

246
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,709
I'd like you to postpone that
report another 48 hours.

247
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,542
The<i> Enterprise</i> is scheduled to
leave the Tyran system tomorrow.

248
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,208
If I'm to change that plan,
I'll need a very good reason.

249
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,417
I realize that, sir.

250
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,792
If you're going to make
a recommendation to Starfleet

251
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,959
about using the particle
fountain on Carema,

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,500
it seems only fair

253
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,959
that you should see it
operating at full strength.

254
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,083
Agreed.

255
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,458
I think I can
complete the project

256
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,208
and boost the efficiency
of the particle stream

257
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,542
if I use exocomps-- the new
devices I've constructed.

258
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,625
I understand
one of these devices

259
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,041
successfully repaired
a faulty power grid.

260
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,041
Yes, sir.
I've been testing them

261
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,458
on a limited basis, but I
think they're ready

262
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,333
to be used on
a larger scale.

263
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,959
Mr. La Forge,
what are your thoughts?

264
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,542
Well, I guess the only risk

265
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,417
is in falling
even further behind.

266
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,208
I'm willing to
take that risk.

267
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,709
Mr. Data?

268
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,667
Exocomps are highly
sophisticated devices, sir.

269
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,417
If they perform
up to expectation,

270
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,208
their potential to advance
this project is considerable.

271
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,959
PICARD:
I'm inclined to agree.

272
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,417
I don't think that 48 hours
is too much time to risk,

273
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,250
particularly when the
gains are so substantial.

274
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,583
You may proceed, Doctor.

275
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,166
Thank you, sir.
If possible,

276
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,667
I'd like Commander Data
to work with me.

277
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,792
Thank you, Doctor.
I welcome the opportunity.

278
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,959
Commander,
there's a plasma conduit

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,500
in one of the access tunnels
that's ready to be sealed.

280
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,542
It's the perfect
job for an exocomp.

281
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,000
I agree, Doctor.

282
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,542
Well, Mr. Data, what is
your analysis so far?

283
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,250
I have successfully
completed 14 separate tasks

284
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,500
with this exocomp
in the past hour.

285
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,709
I estimate it would take
two people nine hours

286
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,917
to complete the same tasks.

287
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,667
I would characterize the unit's
performance as excellent.

288
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,083
I hope Commander La Forge

289
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,709
and Captain Picard
agree with you.

290
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,291
I am confident they will.

291
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,917
Commander La Forge
is especially--

292
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,500
Hmm... it didn't finish
sealing the plasma conduit.

293
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,417
Let me send it back in.

294
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,333
It is not accepting
your commands.

295
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,750
Maybe there's
a malfunction

296
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,375
in the control processor.

297
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,583
Let me see if I
can override it.

298
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,000
Doctor?
I'm all right.

299
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,458
The control PADD
just overloaded.

300
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,291
(<i> whirring and beeping</i> )

301
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,166
What's the matter
with this thing?

302
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:38,542
DATA:<i> Second Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46315.5.</i>

303
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,542
<i>The unexplained behavior</i>
<i>of the exocomp</i>

304
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,041
<i>has greatly puzzled both</i>
<i>Dr. Farallon and myself.</i>

305
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,542
<i>We have brought</i>
<i>the defective unit</i>

306
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,834
<i>to the</i> Enterprise
<i>for investigation.</i>

307
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,458
FARALLON: The exocomp came
out of the plasma conduit.

308
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,875
We tried to override
the commands

309
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:54,959
and send it back in,
but it just shut down.

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,333
It's been completely
unresponsive ever since.

311
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,041
Well, let's see what
our computer has to say.

312
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,083
Geordi, the interface circuitry

313
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,166
which links the exocomp
to the control PADD

314
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,709
is completely burned out.

315
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,291
That's strange.

316
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,750
Is there any indication
of secondary power surges?

317
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:13,041
No.

318
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,709
But what's going on there?

319
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,000
Data, increase
the magnification

320
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,333
of section Gamma-Four.

321
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,125
Interesting.

322
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,750
The number of new
circuit pathways

323
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:31,000
has increased by 632%.

324
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,291
Oh, no.
What is it?

325
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,083
Sometimes an exocomp starts
forming large numbers

326
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,208
of new pathways
totally at random.

327
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,083
Eventually, it reaches a
point where it shuts down,

328
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,000
just like this one.

329
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,667
Doctor, the new pathways
do not appear

330
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,500
to be interfering
with the original circuitry.

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,875
Once the exocomp is this
badly corrupted, it's useless.

332
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:55,291
You have to erase the unit
and start all over again,

333
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,917
and there's no time
for that now.

334
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,834
That leaves you with only two.

335
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,291
It's gonna
slow you down.

336
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,667
Yes, Commander,
you have the right

337
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,333
to point out that
you told me so.

338
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,959
I only wanted to
say that we'd be happy

339
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,625
to add on an extra shift
to pick up the slack.

340
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,250
I guess I'm touchy
these days.

342
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,250
It's okay, you've got
a lot on your shoulders.

343
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,834
Well, I'd better
get back to it.

344
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,750
Thanks, Commander.
Data.

345
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,709
I feel sorry for her.

346
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,709
This project has had
nothing but problems.

347
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,542
Why did that plasma
conduit explode?

348
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,500
Apparently, there was
a micro-fracture

349
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,000
in the conduit wall.

350
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,750
The fault did not register
on our instruments.

351
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,625
Hmm, I guess it's
a good thing

352
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,500
the exocomp
malfunctioned.

353
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:48,583
Almost seems like it knew
just when to leave.

354
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,875
Geordi, are you
implying the exocomp

355
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:54,458
exhibited some form of
self-preservation?

356
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,000
Of course not.

357
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,083
PIERSON: Lieutenant Pierson
to Commander La Forge.

358
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,083
Sir, could you join us
in the systems monitor room?

359
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,834
On my way.

360
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,166
Computer, perform
a Level-1 diagnostic

361
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,959
of the exocomp's
command module.

362
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,750
COMPUTER: The command pathways
are functioning normally.

363
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:36,000
How can that be if the interface
circuitry is burned out?

364
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,959
COMPUTER: The interface
circuitry has been repaired.

365
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,333
Curious.

366
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:46,458
Computer, access
the exocomp's sensor logs.

367
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,041
Confirm that there was a failure
in the interface circuitry

368
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,709
within the last 12 hours.

369
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,959
COMPUTER: Confirmed.
Interface failure occurred

370
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,709
at 1150 hours today

371
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,834
when the exocomp produced
a power surge

372
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,834
which burned out the linkage.

373
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,083
How and when
was it repaired?

374
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,625
COMPUTER:
The exocomp activated

375
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:07,166
a self-repair program
at 1340 hours.

376
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:11,166
Why would the exocomp burn out
its own interface circuitry

377
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,166
and repair it two hours later?

378
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,291
COMPUTER:
Unknown.

379
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,875
Here you are.

380
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:32,709
I thought you'd be
hard at work by now.

381
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,500
I wanted a quiet cup of
tea before I went back.

382
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,208
Gathering strength,
I guess.

383
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,959
Well, I've come to tell
you that I've assigned

384
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,166
two engineering teams to work
on the particle fountain.

385
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:45,250
Thank you, Commander.
I'm grateful.

386
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,834
You know, I really
want you to know

387
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,500
that I do admire the
work that you've done,

388
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,208
and I'm sorry that the
exocomps aren't working out.

389
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,667
You were right.

390
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:57,375
I'm trying to
move too fast.

391
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,417
I guess I lack that
conservative streak

392
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,417
most scientists have.

393
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,375
I always seem to be out there
on the edge, taking chances.

394
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,709
You know, I'll bet you were
the kind of little girl

395
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,125
who was always climbing

396
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,834
one branch higher
than the other kids.

397
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,375
Anything to get to
the top of the tree.

398
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,333
And I bet you never fell.

399
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,041
Oh, no, I fell
all the time.

400
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,917
Usually breaking a bone
in the process.

401
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,917
I just never let it stop me.

402
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,583
Well, if it comes down to
sheer determination,

403
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,709
I know you'll get
this particle fountain built.

404
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,083
You're right about that,
Commander.

405
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,333
I've spent the last six years
of my life on this project.

406
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,792
It's the first thought
I have when I wake up

407
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:38,041
and the last
before I go to bed.

408
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:42,917
Whatever it takes to prove
this technology, I'll do.

409
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,750
Doctor, if you wish
to master the<i> bat'leth</i> sword,

410
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:51,959
you must learn to strike and
avoid in the same motion.

411
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,333
I almost got in
under your guard, Worf.

412
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,583
Almost.

413
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,959
Well, I'll keep that
in mind next lesson.

414
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,458
Doctor...

415
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,875
Are you injured?

416
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:07,000
Only my pride, Data.

417
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,834
Thanks.

418
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:14,667
Doctor, what is the
definition of life?

419
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:25,208
That is a big question.

420
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,583
Why do you ask?

421
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,959
I am searching
for a definition

422
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,834
that will allow me to
test an hypothesis.

423
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,667
Well, the broadest
scientific definition

424
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:36,667
might be that life
is what enables

425
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:39,458
plants and animals
to consume food,

426
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,667
derive energy
from it, grow,

427
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,417
adapt themselves to
their surroundings,

428
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,583
and reproduce.
Hmm.

429
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,458
And you suggest that
anything that exhibits

430
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,709
these characteristics
is considered alive?

431
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,959
In general, yes.

432
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,959
What about fire?

433
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Fire?
Yes.

434
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,583
It consumes fuel to
produce energy.

435
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,500
It grows.
It creates offspring.

436
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:01,333
By your definition,
is it alive?

437
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,458
Fire is a chemical
reaction.

438
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,750
You could use the same
argument for growing crystals,

439
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,834
but obviously, we don't
consider them alive.

440
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,208
And what about me?

441
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,291
I do not grow.
I do not reproduce.

442
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,250
Yet, I am considered
to be alive.

443
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,250
That's true,
but you are unique.

444
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:22,125
Hmm.
I wonder if that is so.

445
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,375
Data, if I may ask...

446
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,750
have a seat.

447
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,417
What exactly
are you getting at?

448
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,792
I am curious as to
what transpired

449
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,959
between the moment
when I was nothing more

450
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,417
than an assemblage of parts
in Dr. Soong's laboratory,

451
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,917
and the next moment,
when I became alive.

452
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:45,083
What is it that
endowed me with life?

453
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,083
I remember Wesley asking
me a similar question

454
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,709
when he was little,
and I tried

455
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,583
desperately to
give him an answer,

456
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,458
but everything I said
sounded inadequate.

457
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,083
But then, I realized that
scientists and philosophers

458
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,959
have been grappling with that
question for centuries,

459
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,750
without coming
to any conclusion.

460
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:03,041
Are you saying the question
cannot be answered?

461
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,667
No.

462
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:06,834
I think I'm saying
that we struggle

463
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,959
all our lives to answer it--

464
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,458
that it's the struggle
that is important.

465
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,875
That's what helps us

466
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,125
to define our place
in the universe.

467
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,500
I believe I understand, Doctor.

468
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,667
I don't think I've been
very much help to you.

469
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,750
On the contrary.

470
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,709
You have been
a great deal of help.

471
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,125
Thank you.

472
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,083
LA FORGE: Murphy's team
will cover gamma shift

473
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,917
from 2300 to 0700 hours.

474
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,625
Okay, Doctor, I've split
the engineering teams

475
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:48,375
among all the shifts,
and if nothing else goes wrong,

476
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:50,500
that should be enough to
help you finish on time.

477
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:52,417
With the help of the
exocomps, I think we will.

478
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,959
Yeah, you think
they'll toe the line?

479
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,375
(<i> whoosh of active transport</i> )
Don't worry.

480
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,458
They know who's in charge.

481
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,208
Doctor.

482
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,542
I must ask you to stop
using the exocomps.

483
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,959
Why, is there something
wrong with them?

484
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,709
No, it is not that.

485
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,959
I have reason to believe
the exocomps are alive.

486
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:21,125
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46316.6.</i>

487
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,041
<i>I have summoned</i>
<i>the senior staff</i>

488
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,583
<i>in order to discuss</i>
<i>Commander Data's theory</i>

489
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,125
<i>that the exocomps</i>
<i>are a life-form.</i>

490
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:31,875
<i>Dr. Farallon has attended</i>
<i>only reluctantly.</i>

491
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,834
Captain, I object to
being called here.

492
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,041
I'm wasting time that could
be better spent elsewhere.

493
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,709
Doctor, I appreciate
your time constraints,

494
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,917
but recognizing new life--
whatever its form--

495
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:46,417
is the principal
mission of this vessel.

496
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,166
Please.

497
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,709
Now, Mr. Data,
will you tell us

498
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,166
what makes you think that
the exocomps are alive.

499
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,542
Sir, when the exocomp
left the access tunnel

500
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,709
prior to the explosion,
it may have been

501
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,583
attempting to save
itself from destruction.

502
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,667
Do you have any basis
for that conclusion?

503
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:08,583
Yes. When you attempted
to override the exocomp

504
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,125
and send it back
into the tunnel,

505
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,667
it responded by
deliberately

506
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,792
burning out its
control interface.

507
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:14,917
Deliberately?

508
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,417
The computer
diagnostics showed

509
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,041
that the exocomp disabled
its own interface.

510
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,417
That could have been nothing
more than a malfunction.

511
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:22,750
However, two hours later,

512
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,291
when it was back
aboard the<i> Enterprise</i>

513
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,959
and no longer in danger,
it repaired itself.

514
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,792
I believe the exocomp

515
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:33,333
was protecting itself--
and if that is true,

516
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:36,000
it has demonstrated an
awareness of its environment,

517
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,458
and an ability to adapt
to that environment.

518
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,792
You're anthropomorphizing
these units.

519
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:45,291
Like any mechanical devices,
they occasionally malfunction.

520
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,291
One time, I saw an exocomp
enter a reaction chamber

521
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:51,000
for no apparent reason
and vaporize itself.

522
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,500
Is that supposed
to make me think

523
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,250
it was depressed and suicidal?

524
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,208
TROI: Doctor, why is it so
difficult for you to accept

525
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,875
the fact that the exocomp
could be alive?

526
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:01,875
After all, you're talking
to a living machine right now.

527
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,792
And I have nothing but
the utmost respect

528
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:07,250
and admiration for
Dr. Soong's accomplishment.

529
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,375
But his intention
was to create

530
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:10,667
an artificial life-form.

531
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,333
I created the
exocomps to be tools.

532
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,875
And there is a big difference

533
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:16,917
between Data and a tool.

534
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,792
Doctor, there is
a big difference

535
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:23,625
between you and a virus,
but both are alive.

536
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:27,166
If the possibility exists,
no matter how slight,

537
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:29,458
that these exocomps
are life-forms,

538
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
then we must examine
that possibility.

539
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:32,959
Thank you, sir.

540
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,792
And until we have
a definitive answer,

541
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,458
I believe it would
be inappropriate

542
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,542
to exploit the
exocomps as laborers.

543
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:39,792
Captain, that's absurd.

544
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:42,166
If they<i> are</i>
intelligent life-forms,

545
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,667
we have no right to force
them to work for us.

546
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,667
That's like me telling you
not to use your tricorder.

547
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:49,333
Tricorders aren't alive.

548
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,709
Neither are exocomps.

549
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,750
Clearly, these are
difficult issues to resolve.

550
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:58,291
We have to proceed
very carefully.

551
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:02,291
So, the first task is to test
Mr. Data's hypothesis.

552
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,709
Data, you're claiming
that this exocomp may be alive

553
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,333
because it demonstrated
survival instincts.

554
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,875
Right?
Yes.

555
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,917
Then why don't we just threaten

556
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,291
its survival again
and see what happens?

557
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,583
Make it so.

558
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,834
Doctor, we're pretty
much ready here.

559
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,792
You can begin
programming it.

560
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:32,625
What we've done, Captain,
is to re-create

561
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,500
a situation similar
to the one the exocomp

562
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,500
encountered in the
plasma conduit.

563
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:39,667
We have created a small
conduit breach in this tube.

564
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:42,333
The exocomp would normally
take several minutes

565
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,417
to complete a
repair of this type.

566
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,250
But once it enters the tube,
it will find

567
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,959
that a plasma-cascade
failure is in progress.

568
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,542
I assume this
is a simulation.

569
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,125
LA FORGE: Oh, yes, sir.
We're running

570
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,125
a transient overload
signal that will simulate

571
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,291
a failure in exactly
one minute.

572
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,583
If it does possess a
survival instinct--

573
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,000
as Mr. Data claims--

574
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:02,333
it will exit the tube
before the minute is up

575
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,709
in order to
save itself.

576
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,458
Very well. Proceed.

577
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,875
Okay.

578
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,500
Beginning test program now.

579
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,000
One minute.

580
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,166
50 seconds.

581
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,000
30 seconds.

582
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,917
Ten seconds.

583
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:16,583
Five, four, three

584
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:20,250
two, one.

585
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:23,500
That's it.
If this had been for real,

586
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:25,041
that conduit would
have exploded

587
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,959
with the exocomp inside.

588
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,125
Go ahead, Doctor,
bring it back in.

589
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,709
Well, Captain,
I think we've spent

590
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,125
more than enough time
answering this question.

591
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,667
I hope the outcome
wasn't too much

592
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:37,542
of a disappointment
for you, Mr. Data.

593
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,458
It certainly came
as no surprise to me.

594
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,000
Thank you
for your help, Doctor.

595
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,375
You're welcome.

596
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,792
Well, I consider
this time well spent.

597
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:47,166
As do I, sir.
Thank you.

598
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,583
COMPUTER:
30 seconds.

599
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:01,166
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

600
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:08,417
COMPUTER:
20 seconds.

601
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,792
Commander Riker said
you'd still be down here.

602
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,959
He also said the exocomp
failed the test.

603
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,542
That is true.

604
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:19,250
COMPUTER: Time expired.
Test complete.

605
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,667
I have completed
34 additional tests

606
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:24,000
and the results have been
the same in each of them.

607
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,875
Perhaps I was wrong
in suspecting

608
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,417
the exocomp was alive.

609
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:30,208
This was really important
to you, wasn't it?

610
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:34,834
You said earlier
that I am unique.

611
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,917
If so, then I am alone
in the universe.

612
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:40,583
When I began investigating
the exocomps, I realized

613
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:44,000
I might be encountering
a progenitor of myself.

614
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,583
Suddenly,
the possibility exists

615
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,000
that I am no longer alone.

616
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,542
For that reason, I...

617
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,500
(<i> whirring</i> )

618
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,709
The exocomp has returned.

619
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:06,166
Wasn't it supposed
to do that?

620
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:09,250
In the previous 34 trials,
I brought it back

621
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:11,417
once the simulated
failure occurred.

622
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:14,208
This time, we were talking
and I neglected to do that.

623
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,750
I distracted you.
I'm sorry.

624
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:17,375
Do not apologize, Doctor.

625
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:19,750
I believe we have made
a significant discovery.

626
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:21,083
What?

627
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,291
The exocomp has replicated
a different tool.

628
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,166
That is not the
molecular fuser it had

629
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:26,959
when it entered the
Jefferies tube.

630
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:35,792
Doctor, the exocomp not only
completed the repairs,

631
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,834
it also deactivated
the overload signal.

632
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:41,166
I thought this was
just a simulation.

633
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:44,583
It was, and the exocomp
must have realized that.

634
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,166
It saw that there
was no real danger,

635
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:49,000
and completed the repairs.

636
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,166
And replicated
the correct tool

637
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:54,417
to eliminate the false
overload signal.

638
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:57,250
I see no other
possible explanation.

639
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:00,375
The exocomp didn't
fail the test.

640
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:02,792
It saw right through it.

641
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46317.8.</i>

<i>I have agreed</i>

643

00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,834

647
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,500
FARALLON: We're definitely
making progress, Captain.

648
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,166
I'm not sure we'll be
at full capacity

649
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,667
within the 48 hour deadline,
but we'll be close.

650
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,500
It looks like there's
still some difficulty

651
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:40,083
with the phase selectors.

652
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,834
That's true, but I'm sure
it's the last real problem.

653
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,250
I hope for the sake
of the project

654
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,500
that you're right, Doctor.

655
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,875
I understand, sir.

656
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,417
We're going to
do our best.

657
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,625
(<i> powering down</i> )

658
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:55,834
This is strange.

659
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,291
Primary power
is still on line.

660
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,917
Maybe it's another
power grid malfunction.

661
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,417
No, I don't think so.

662
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,041
Something seems
to be drawing power

663
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,625
into the main particle impeller.

664
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:06,083
That's not a good sign.
It could mean...

665
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,750
We've lost internal
confinement.

666
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:11,667
The particle stream
is beginning to surge.

667
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:12,834
Captain, a radiation field

668
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,291
is gonna flood
this entire chamber.

669
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,917
We've gotta get everybody
out of here immediately.

670
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,834
Understood. Doctor, the station
must be evacuated.

671
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,625

Yeah, I'm fine, Captain.
I only caught the edge of it.

698
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,625
He's dead.

699
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,083
RIKER:
Chief, do you have them?

700
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,250
They're here, sir.

701
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,542
RIKER:
Is everyone all right?

702
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:26,125
We're fine, sir,
but Captain Picard,

703
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,625
Commander La Forge
and one of my men

704
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:30,458
are still on the station.

705
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,250
Kelso, can you
get them off?

706
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:35,500
I'm trying, sir-- I can't
establish a pattern lock.

707
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:38,250
Commander, we barely managed
to transport off ourselves.

708
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,291
The field ionization
is too intense.

709
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,375
Commander,
the particle fountain

710
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:43,959
is continuing to surge.

711
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,208
At the present rate, the
radiation in the station core

712
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,125
will reach fatal levels
in 23 minutes.

713
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:58,583
Captain, if I can access
the field emitters,

714
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,375
we should be able to
establish a force field.

715
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:01,667
See if you can link
your console

716
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:03,542
to my command system
sub-routine.

717
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,959
All right.

718
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,375
Link established.

719
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:10,208
Okay, here we go.

720
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,875
I'm reading
power fluctuations.

721
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:18,375
The force field
is not stable.

722
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,125
Yeah, I know, the radiation
levels are too high.

723
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,917
The emitters are
beginning to deteriorate.

724
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,500
How long can we
expect it to last?

725
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:25,166
Not very long.
We have to keep it up

726
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:27,000
long enough for
Commander Riker to get to us.

727
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:28,750
You know, maybe we
can help him out.

728
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:31,250
See if you can access the
emergency shutdown routine.

729
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,625
I'll try to activate
the ionic dampers.

730
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,333
A force field
was activated

731
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,375
on the station
a few moments ago.

732
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:41,208
It is possible that
Commander La Forge

733
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,291
has established a
low-intensity deflector field.

734
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,583
It won't last long
in that radiation.

735
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,458
No, sir.
My readings indicate

736
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,500
that it will fail in
approximately 22 minutes.

737
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:55,208
Okay, we've got 22 minutes.
I want some options.

738
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,291
Can we send a shuttlecraft
to evacuate them?

739
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,291
We'd never get
there in time.

740
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,458
Then we need to shut down
the particle fountain.

741
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,667
What if we detonate a
low-yield photon torpedo

742
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:05,000
within the particle stream?

743
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:06,667
Wouldn't that shut it down?
Mm-hmm.

744
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:08,959
We'd have to configure the
torpedo very carefully--

745
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,959
the shape of the shock
wave would be critical--

746
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,625
but it could work.

747
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:14,333
How long would it take
to set that up?

748
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:16,917
I estimate that it would
take a minimum of 65 minutes

749
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,667
to properly configure
the torpedo.

750
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,375
We don't have
that kind of time.

751
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:25,458
Commander, maybe the
exocomps can help us.

752
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,583
I can program their
boridium power cells

753
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,125
to explode on command.

754
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:32,125
They can be configured just
like a photon torpedo,

755
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:33,917
but it would only take
a couple of minutes.

756
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:36,875
Commander, I must
object to that plan.

757
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,500
Data, we've
been through this.

758
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,125
We tested the exocomp,
and it failed.

759
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,166
Dr. Crusher and I
discovered that the exocomp

760
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,834
did not fail the test.
It is still my belief

761
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,542
we are dealing
with a new life-form.

762
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:47,709
RIKER: Mr. Data,
you know how much

763
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,041
I respect your judgment.

764
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,625
But I can't risk
the Captain and Geordi

765
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:54,125
on the basis of your<i> belief.</i>

766
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,875
Prepare the exocomp,
Doctor.

767
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:57,583
Commander, if I am correct,

768
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,291
the exocomps will not allow
themselves to be destroyed.

769
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:02,041
They have a sense of survival,

770
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:04,834
and they will shut down before
they will comply with the order.

771
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:09,208
I could disconnect their command
pathways before I program them.

772
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:15,792
Do it.

773
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:28,834
Commander Riker,
we're ready.

774
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,250
Mr. Worf,
target 200 meters

775
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:32,208
below the apex of the
particle stream.

776
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,875
Feed the coordinates
to Transporter Room Two.

777
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:37,667
Aye, sir.

778
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:39,417
Coordinates received.

779
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:40,792
Mr. Kelso...

780
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:42,917
energize.

781
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,709
(<i> power shutting down</i> )

782
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,375
Mr. Kelso?

783
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,917
I'm sorry, sir.

784
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,792
The transporter system
just went dead.

785
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,417
There's some kind
of malfunction.

786
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,417
Run a diagnostic
immediately.

787
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:56,959
Try bypassing--
Commander.

788
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,792
That will not be necessary.

789
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:02,625
The transporter
is not malfunctioning.

790
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:05,125
I have locked out the controls.

791
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,959
I gave you a direct order,
Mr. Data.

792
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,083
You release that
transporter lockout now.

793
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,834
I cannot do that, sir.

794
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:23,500
If you don't do it,
I will relieve you of duty.

795
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,583
That is your
prerogative, sir.

796
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,083
Under Starfleet regulations,

797
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:30,041
direct insubordination is
a court-martial offense.

798
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,375
But I will not
release the transporter.

799
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,750
Data, those are two of
your friends out there.

800
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:38,500
They have saved
your life more times

801
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:39,959
than I can remember.
I can't believe

802
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,792
you'd be willing to
sacrifice them like this.

803
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:45,291
Commander, please do not think
this is an arbitrary decision.

804
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,375
I have considered
the ramifications

805
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:48,709
of my actions carefully,

806
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,625
and I do not believe
it is justified

807
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,083
to sacrifice
one life-form for another.

808
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:56,458
You don't know that the exocomps
are life-forms.

809
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,083
It is true I am acting
on my personal beliefs,

810
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:01,291
but I do not see
how I can do otherwise.

811
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:04,500
You're risking a lot on
the basis of a belief.

812
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:07,166
I have observed that humans
often base their judgments

813
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:10,125
on what is referred to as
"instinct" or "intuition."

814
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:12,166
Because I am a machine,

815
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,917
I lack that
particular ability.

816
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,417
However, it may be possible
that I have insight

817
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,542
into other machines
that humans lack.

818
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,750
If there were a way to save
the Captain and Geordi

819
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,333
without destroying
the exocomps,

820
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,375
I would jump on it,
but we have run out of time

821
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,250
and this is the only
solution I've got.

822
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,291
Then let me offer
an alternative.

823
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,583
Transport me
to the station.

824
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,041
I will attempt a complete

825
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,959
manual shutdown of
the particle stream.

826
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,709
The radiation levels are
too high, even for you.

827
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,166
Your positronic net
would ionize in no time.

828
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:43,041
I can't let you
sacrifice yourself.

829
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:46,917
Commander, if I give my life
for my fellow officers,

830
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:48,583
that is my choice.

831
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,458
The exocomps
no longer have a choice.

832
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:54,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

833
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,625
Then, what if we reconnect
their command pathways

834
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:00,333
and we give them a choice?

835
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:02,792
You've assumed the exocomps
would shut down

836
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,667
before accepting
this mission.

837
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,583
What if we asked them if
they are willing to proceed?

838
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:16,792
That sounds
reasonable, sir.

839
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:18,625
If they choose to go,

840
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,166
I would be willing to release
the transporter lockout.

841
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,875
Fair enough.

842
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:37,083
All right, I've enabled
their command pathways.

843
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,625
If the exocomps
do not shut down

844
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,959
after I have
programmed them,

845
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,625
we may assume they
are willing to go.

846
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:46,333
(<i> beeping</i> )

847
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:54,709
Well, does that mean
they're willing to go or not?

848
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,834
Well, they haven't
shut down.

849
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:59,667
They seem to be reprogramming
the commands I have entered.

850
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:01,125
Reprogramming them?

851
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,166
Clearly, they are unwilling
to be transported

852
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,083
into the stream
for detonation.

853
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,417
Although they may have
an alternative solution.

854
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:09,250
Something we haven't considered?

855
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:11,750
Are you suggesting they have
superior intelligence?

856
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:13,125
No, Doctor.

857
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:15,333
But they do have
superior experience.

858
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,083
During their service,

859
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,542
the exocomps
have interfaced

860
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,208
with every part of
the station core--

861
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,083
something none of us has done,
including yourself.

862
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:26,583
They may have another way to
control the particle surge.

863
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,291
Those appear to
be power taps.

864
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,542
Sir, new coordinates
are being fed

865
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:35,375
to the transporter
by the exocomps.

866
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:38,208
The coordinates are
inside the station core.

867
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:40,834
Kelso, energize.

868
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,542
Aye, sir.

869
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,542
Mr. La Forge.

870
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,875
LA FORGE:
What are they up to?

871
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:06,166
The exocomps are siphoning
power from the core.

872
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,875
They're trying to distort
the particle stream frequency.

873
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:10,667
That might open up a window
that the<i> Enterprise</i>

874
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:12,291
can use to beam us out.

875
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,834
If they can modulate the
radiation field, it'll work.

876
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,542
But they'll have to get the
subharmonic frequencies

877
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:18,166
to resonance.

878
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:24,291
The particle stream frequency
is beginning to fluctuate.

879
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:27,458
They're having a little
difficulty controlling

880
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,375
the feedback, it may be more
power than they can handle.

881
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,000
Can we help them?
Is there any way

882
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:32,583
that we can modulate
the power transfer?

883
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,542
No, sir, we've done
all that we can do.

884
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:37,250
It's up to them now.

885
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:42,709
They're beginning to balance
the power absorption rates.

886
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,083
It's working.

887
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:46,709
The particle stream is
beginning to distort.

888
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,166
Almost at resonance.

889
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,834
They've got it.
Drop the force field.

890
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,166
Commander, I've got
a pattern lock.

891
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,166
Energize.

892
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,375
Can you lock on
to the exocomps?

893
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:14,041
I'm trying, sir.

894
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:29,458
I'm sorry, sir, I was only able
to lock on to two of them.

895
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,500
For some reason, I couldn't
fix a signal on the other one.

896
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:35,542
One of them had to continue
disrupting the particle stream.

897
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:39,166
Absorbing that much power
could prevent a signal lock.

898
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,583
It was the only way
to save the other two.

899
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,458
I must admit, you've given me

900
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,583
a lot to think about,
Commander Data.

901
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,125
I don't exactly know

902
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:57,583
what the exocomps are.

903
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:59,375
But you can be assured
that until I do,

904
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:01,750
I won't be treating
them as simple tools.

905
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,542
Thank you, Doctor.

906
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,166
I wish your work on
the particle fountain

907
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,083
had been more successful.

908
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:09,792
Perhaps the exocomps will
help you to reconstruct it.

909
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:11,375
I hope they will.

910
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:13,792
And I predict that
in a year or two,

911
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:15,375
you will be able
to recommend

912
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:18,000
the technology
to Starfleet.

913
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:20,250
I look forward to it.

914
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:23,375
Doctor.

915
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,417
Something more,
Mr. Data?

916
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:31,125
Yes, sir.

917
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,458
I thought you might want to
know why I was willing

918
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,917
to risk your life for
several small machines.

919
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:39,542
I think I understand the
predicament you were in.

920
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,125
It could not have
been an easy choice.

921
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,917
No, sir, it was not.

922
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:46,000
When my own status as a living
being was in question,

923
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,083
you fought to protect my rights,

924
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,917
and for that
I will always be grateful.

925
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:52,333
The exocomps had
no such advocate.

926
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:54,375
If I had not acted
on their behalf,

927
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:56,583
they would have been destroyed.

928
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:59,500
I could not allow that
to happen, sir.

929
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:02,417
Of course you couldn't.

930
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:06,333
It was the most human decision
you've ever made.
