00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:06,250
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41386.4:</i>

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,417
<i>We are in pursuit of a starship</i>
<i>of Ferengi design.</i>

3
00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:11,417
<i>Our mission is</i>
<i>to intercept and recover</i>

4
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:13,875
<i>a T-9 energy converter</i>
<i>which the Ferengi stole</i>

5
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,834
<i>from an unmanned monitor post</i>

6
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:17,375
<i>on Gamma Tauri IV</i>

7
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,208
<i>a theft which automatic</i>
<i>scanners recorded</i>

8
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,333
<i>providing us with</i>
<i>the long-awaited opportunity</i>

9
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,875
<i>to make close contact</i>
<i>with a Ferengi vessel.</i>

10
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,208
<i>If we succeed in this chase</i>

11
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:30,792
<i>it will be Starfleet's</i>
<i>first look at a life-form</i>

12
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:34,917
<i>which, discounting rumor,</i>
<i>we know almost nothing about.</i>

13
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:36,917
There she is.

14
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,000
Enlarge.

15
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,917
What is their course?

16
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:50,959
They're now angling through
that solar system, Captain.

17
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,250
Identify.

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,917
Listed as
Delphi Ardu, sir--

19
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:56,750
eleven planets,
unexplored.

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,667
Stay with them, La Forge.

21
00:00:58,667 --> 00:00:59,834
Aye, sir.

22
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,542
Sensors read a power surge

23
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:07,000
from their last maneuver,
Captain.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,375
LA FORGE:
They are dropping
to sub-warp speed.

25
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,959
Reduce to impulse power.

26
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,083
Sensors record fluctuations

27
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,166
in the energy readings from it,
Captain.

28
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,542
Possibility:
a malfunction in
their engines, sir.

29
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:24,875
Breaks my heart.

30
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,750
WORF:
In visual range,
Captain.

31
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,333
Fully enlarge.

32
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:35,083
Hello, stranger.

33
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,125
Very impressive design.

34
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,041
Anything on that
design, Data?

35
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,917
Nothing specific, sir.

36
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,417
As you know,
Ferengi technology

37
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:44,917
is estimated to be
generally equal
to our own.

38
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:47,750
PICARD:
But that does not mean
identical, however.

39
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,166
Correct, sir.

40
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,542
We are no doubt
advanced in some areas--

41
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:52,917
they in others.

42
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,166
Showing another
power surge, sir.

43
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,750
They are firing on us!

44
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,000
Damage report.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,208
YAR:
Shields holding.

46
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,917
Mostly electromagnetic.

47
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,959
Fusion generator
and batteries

48
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,250
down by 30 percent.

49
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,291
<i>Our</i> impulse engines
are surging now.

50
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,375
WORF:
They're
firing again.

51
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,458
YAR:
Deflector shield power
weakening, Captain.

52
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,166
Phasers ready.

53
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,333
Photon torpedoes ready.

54
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,000
Do we return their fire, sir?

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,500
Negative,
Number One.

56
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,291
They're just responding
to our close pursuit.

57
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,959
Fall back a bit,
but stay with them.

58
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,458
They're slowing too, sir.

59
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,458
They may be turning to fight.

60
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,917
Open hailing frequen...

61
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:52,208
Why are we gaining on them?

62
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,709
Don't anticipate.

63
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,250
LA FORGE:
I'm not, sir.
Something's wrong.

64
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,750
DATA:
Sir, something is
dragging us forward.

65
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,041
I read that, too.

66
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,959
Lieutenant Yar, what
do your sensors show?

67
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,333
Not certain, sir.

68
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,542
I'm getting
very confusing readings.

69
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:08,625
Captain...

70
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,959
this shouldn't be.

71
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,125
Our power systems
are failing.

72
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,291
YAR:
Deflector
shield failing.

73
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,291
Phasers going inoperative,
Captain.

74
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,834
Captain, something is completely
immobilizing us.

75
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:22,333
Immobilized by the damn Ferengi!

76
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,834
I need more
information.

77
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:26,208
What the hell
are they using?

78
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,458
Obviously, we've
underestimated

79
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,166
their technology,
Captain.

80
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,583
Considerably.

81
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:48,709
It appears the Ferengi have us
right where they want us--

82
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,125
in<i> their</i> sights.

83
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,583
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

84
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:21,333
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

85
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,583
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

86
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,583
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

87
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:31,625
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

88
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:36,750
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

89
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,750
Are you searching
all frequencies?

90
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,000
Is there any sign
of any message?

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,250
Negative, sir.

92
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,875
Weapons report, Lieutenant.

93
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,750
I have phasers
and torpedoes armed

94
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,208
but I show insufficient power
to fire them.

95
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,834
Engineering, give me status

96
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:02,333
on power recovery.

97
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,125
Engineering, come in.

98
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,125
Why aren't they
answering?

99
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,583
La Forge.
Sir?

100
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,250
Get me a full report
from Engineering.

101
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,000
Aye, sir.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's impossible
they could be draining

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
all power
from all systems.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,250
Counselor?

105
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,750
I'm sensing nothing
from them, sir.

106
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,709
Which could mean
they can shield

107
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:30,208
their thoughts and emotions
from others.

108
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,959
Which still makes it
our move.

109
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,000
Sir, they may know as little
about us as we do about them.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,083
Except that they know that
they've got us in deep trouble.

111
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,500
If so, then
the question becomes

112
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,667
what do they do
with that knowledge?

113
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,709
Data, do you have
any information

114
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,166
touching this on any file?

115
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,458
None, sir.

116
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,917
Only hearsay
and third-hand reports

117
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,291
most of which conflict.

118
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,458
Which reports
do not conflict?

119
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,083
That the Ferengi are...

120
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,458
Well, the best description
may be "traders."

121
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,417
What kind of traders?

122
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:02,417
A comparison modern scholars
have drawn from Earth history

123
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:05,250
likens the Ferengi to
the ocean-going Yankee traders

124
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,667
of 18th and 19th century
America, sir.

125
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,500
From the history
of my forebears--
Yankee traders.

126
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,458
Who in this case sail the<i> galaxy</i>

127
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,500
in search of mercantile
and territorial opportunity.

128
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,542
And are these scholars

129
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:17,834
saying that
the Ferengi

130
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:18,875
may not be unlike us?

131
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:19,875
Hardly, sir.

132
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,458
I believe the analogy refers

133
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,291
to the worst quality
of capitalists.

134
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,458
The Ferengi are believed

135
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,000
to conduct their affairs
of commerce

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,458
on the ancient principle,
<i>caveat emptor--</i>

137
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,667
"let the buyer beware."

138
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,166
RIKER:
Yankee traders--

139
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,291
I like the sound of that.

140
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,542
Well, sir...

141
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,333
I doubt they wear
red, white and blue

142
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,834
or look anything like Uncle Sam.

143
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,291
Engineering?

144
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,333
Join La Forge down below
in Engineering, Number One.

145
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,792
Aye, sir.

146
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:47,750
Without warp capacity,
we're just a floating target.

147
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,959
Uncle who?

148
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,375
YAR:
<i>What have bright</i>

149
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,291
primary colors
got to do with it?

150
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,083
I understand the allusion.

151
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,959
Colors representing countries

152
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,041
at a time when they
competed with each other.

153
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,709
Red, white and blue
for the United States

154
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,417
whereas the French more properly
used the same colors

155
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:12,250
in the order
of blue, white and red.

156
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,959
And the German nation
red, black and gold

157
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,750
the Italians green, white
and red; the British...

158
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,875
That's enough, Data.

159
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,166
It was you who...

160
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,458
We were discussing
the Ferengi.

161
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,750
I wish I had some clue

162
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,917
as to what they
will do next.

163
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,208
Given what is now happening
to our ship, sir

164
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,625
their weapons could be
vastly superior to ours.

165
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:35,625
Yes, Data, that is
a natural assumption.

166
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,208
Engineering?

167
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,875
Bottom line, La Forge.

168
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,500
Uh, it's not good, sir.

169
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,959
The Ferengi force field
that holds this ship

170
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,250
compensates almost as fast
as we can increase power.

171
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,834
Almost?

172
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,875
Well, there's a .372
millisecond delay

173
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,834
between the use
of our power

174
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:55,417
and the neutralizing counter
force of the Ferengi.

175
00:08:55,417 --> 00:09:00,208
See, we push and they push back
with equal force, sir.

176
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,417
What's our acceleration delay
between slow-reverse impulse

177
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,291
and top warp speed?

178
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:19,166
Well, that's .300 milliseconds,
but there's...

179
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,417
Ah, I see
where you're going.

180
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:25,417
We shift down then kick hard
into warp nine.

181
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:27,458
Yeah, come back
fighting! Whoo-whee!

182
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,625
Can we do it, Geordi?

183
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,667
Ask me after
it's done, sir.

184
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:34,458
I want a slow reverse-engine
drop-off over five minutes.

185
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,041
We'll show them
what this baby can do, sir.

186
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,208
Give me everything
you've got, La Forge.

187
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,458
Aye, aye, sir.

188
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,208
RIKER:
Now a sudden abrupt power surge
to high warp speed, Captain

189
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,667
we may be able to break loose
from that Ferengi force field.

190
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,750
I wish I knew what they
were thinking over there.

191
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,834
They're wondering what
we're going to do next.

192
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,959
I say fight, sir.

193
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,208
There's nothing shameful

194
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,250
in falling
before a superior enemy.

195
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,166
And nothing shameful
in a strategic retreat either.

196
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,917
LA FORGE:
All systems
ready, Captain.

197
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,333
And communication
now restored to engineering.

198
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,542
Excellent, La Forge.

199
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:16,959
Now, let's uh...

200
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,500
Let's throw them
off guard.

201
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,542
Lieutenant Yar,
open hailing frequencies.

202
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:26,041
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

203
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,250
At least we won't begin
with weakness.

204
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,625
Attention,
Ferengi starship.

205
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,291
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

206
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,542
In the name of the United
Federation of Planets

207
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:40,542
I demand that you return
the T-9 energy converter

208
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:43,500
you removed from Gamma Tauri IV.

209
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,667
Send that in all language forms.

210
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,250
All language forms, sir.

211
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,917
Sometimes, Riker

212
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,750
the best way to fight
is not to be there.

213
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,291
Yes, sir.

214
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,583
"He will triumph
who knows when to fight

215
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,667
and when not to fight."

216
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,542
I'm glad the Academy
is still teaching

217
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,291
the strategies of Sun Tzu.

218
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,250
This delay had better
prove out, La Forge.

219
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,583
.300 milliseconds, sir.

220
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,959
Let's blast full power
into warp nine.

221
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,208
Ready?

222
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,709
On your command, Captain.

223
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,166
On the count of three.

224
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,959
Stand by on phasers.

225
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:22,959
One-- set warp to nine.

226
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,667
Two-- divert shield power
to main engines.

227
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:28,917
Three.

228
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,291
<i>Merde.</i>

229
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,542
Shields up.

230
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,125
Captain, I think
you had better see this.

231
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,500
What's wrong?

232
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,333
Someone is reading
every file

233
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,041
every bit of information

234
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,792
stored in the<i> Enterprise</i>
memory banks.

235
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:15,417
They can do that?

236
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,542
And more, perhaps.

237
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,709
Captain.

238
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,667
If I may
recommend.

239
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:29,041
With our attention
on the Ferengi vessel

240
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,250
we have ignored the planet.

241
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,583
Data, consult the charts
on this planet.

242
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,291
See what we've got on it.

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,750
Conference evaluation.

244
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,709
So, while we still have
some power left

245
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:51,375
it's time
for difficult decisions.

246
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,166
Opinions, please?

247
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,417
I say put all available power
into a full-out, combined phaser

248
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,166
and photon torpedo salvo.

249
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,083
Destroy their ability to sustain
this force field, sir.

250
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,125
Yes!

251
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,834
Hit them hard and hit them fast.

252
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,417
Impractical.

253
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,000
And provocative.

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,166
Even assuming that we have the
power to sustain such a tactic.

255
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,458
But, Captain, isn't firing on us
an act of war?

256
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,917
TROI:
The facts are the Ferengi
did fire on us

257
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,208
but we were
chasing them.

258
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,792
Since then, all they've done
is search our computers

259
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:22,792
trying to learn
who and what we are.

260
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,083
Your point, Counselor?

261
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,458
Let's talk to them.

262
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,208
It's been tried.
No response.

263
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:31,458
But did we tell them
anything they wanted to hear?

264
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,458
La Forge?

265
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,291
Other opinions?

266
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,458
Thank you for your advice.

267
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,083
PICARD:
Will...

268
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,208
I haven't heard your assessment.

269
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,917
I believe we've covered
every available option, Captain.

270
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:07,125
Are there other options
that you want to analyze?

271
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,417
The only one remaining

272
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,875
is the one that needs
no conversation--

273
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,709
the one we must avoid.

274
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:15,500
Sir?

275
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,834
The one that leads
to total annihilation.

276
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,792
Open hailing
frequencies.

277
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,375
DATA:
Open, sir.

278
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,208
Attention, Ferengi starship.

279
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,083
This is Captain Picard.

280
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,750
It is obvious that
we are in a situation here

281
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,166
which needs resolving

282
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:56,750
and we are willing to do
whatever is... required.

283
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,875
Whatever is necessary.

284
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,166
I would like...

285
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,500
I would request

286
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,667
that you present
your terms to us.

287
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:26,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41386.5:</i>

288
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:29,083
<i>It is with a heavy heart</i>

289
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,792
<i>that I have offered to meet</i>

290
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:33,792
<i>whatever reasonable and</i>
<i>necessary terms are demanded</i>

291
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,417
<i>by the Ferengi.</i>

292
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:37,583
<i>I fear for my people</i>
<i>and my vessel in the event</i>

293
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:41,000
<i>the unknown Ferengi</i>
<i>ask the unreasonable.</i>

294
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,542
<i>How can I oppose</i>
<i>even unreasonable demands?</i>

295
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:46,250
It's moving, sir.

296
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,333
WORF:
We ask to
surrender

297
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,709
and<i> now</i> they
fire on us?

298
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,208
Ready torpedoes, sir.

299
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,250
We have enough power
for a few of them.

300
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,417
Ready.

301
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,208
But hold on ready.

302
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,041
Open hailing frequencies.

303
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,250
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

304
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,125
Ferengi vessel,
we await your response.

305
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,834
Suggest first strike, sir.

306
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,750
Our shields now only have
63 seconds

307
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,417
of power left before lowering.

308
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:15,083
WORF:
If the Ferengis' ship
sensors can read us, sir

309
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,250
they will be waiting until
we are most vulnerable.

310
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,333
I'm afraid I agree, Captain;
they have not responded...

311
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,500
We will wait a bit more,
Number One.

312
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,750
50 Seconds.

313
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,125
Patience.

314
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,542
Patience.

315
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,625
The quicker we can come
to terms

316
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,750
the better, NCC 1701-D.

317
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,583
Who is speaking?

318
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:42,792
I am Tarr,
Daimon of the Ferengi.

319
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,542
You wished to discuss surrender,
Captain Picard?

320
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,750
What I said, Daimon Tarr, is...

321
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,917
Unconditional surrender,
I warn you

322
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:55,291
is totally unacceptable.

323
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,709
We will die
to the last one of us

324
00:16:57,709 --> 00:16:59,542
before such dishonor.

325
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,166
Hailing frequencies
closed, sir.

326
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,375
Something has seized
their ship, too.

327
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,792
They're in the same
predicament as us.

328
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,583
Launch a sensor probe.

329
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,041
Set it to search
for the source of...

330
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,125
whatever this "something" is
that is holding both ships.

331
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,166
Go back
to hailing frequency, fast.

332
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:26,208
...and I regret, Daimon Tarr,
that I can no longer negotiate

333
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,583
unless it is conducted visually.

334
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,750
Your complete message
not received,<i> Enterprise</i>

335
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,250
but visual communication
is against our custom.

336
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,291
And it is against
Starfleet orders

337
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,959
to accept
a surrender otherwise.

338
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,709
Do you withdraw
your surrender?

339
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,000
You give us
no choice,<i> Enterprise.</i>

340
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,041
May we have
a visual on you, as well?

341
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,959
Agreed, Daimon Tarr.

342
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,000
You should be able
to view us now.

343
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,583
Are we on your screen?

344
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,500
Yes, the ugliness of the hu-man
was not an exaggeration.

345
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,792
I do not know how
your twisted alien culture

346
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,250
has paralyzed our vessel

347
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,000
but I concede
your<i> Enterprise</i> is superior.

348
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,291
We will return
your worthless T-9 device

349
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,125
and we offer the lives
of our second officers

350
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,709
as required by the Ferengi code.

351
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:22,792
Fortunately, Starfleet
has no such rules

352
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:24,959
involving its second officers.

353
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,250
Is this to your satisfaction
Picard Captain?

354
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,291
Your offer may be inadequate

355
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,125
but I will discuss it
with my staff.

356
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,959
Stand by
for further communication.

357
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,125
Matthew! Pola!

358
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,959
You know this area
is off-limits!

359
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,959
Come on, come on!

360
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,000
Boys will be boys, Captain.

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,750
Lieutenant, have you
launched the probe?

362
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,083
Aye, sir.

363
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,041
We should be getting
those readings soon.

364
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,417
If we're not
holding the Ferengi

365
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,417
and they're not holding us,
who the hell is?

366
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:00,000
Well, the probe will give us
some of those answers, sir.

367
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:03,000
Data!

368
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,583
You were going
to show us something.

369
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,333
As requested, Captain

370
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,709
library computer information
on this planet.

371
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:13,417
It has been charted
only from long-range scans.

372
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:15,000
It is class "M"

373
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,750
but shows no indication
of life-forms--

374
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,041
sentient or otherwise.

375
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,375
However, you may find
this of interest.

376
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:25,166
Resolving it
into our language.

377
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,542
The center
of a huge space federation--

378
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,917
a population of trillions.

379
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,375
Trillions?

380
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,667
I've never heard
the word "Tkon" before.

381
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,166
Understandable.

382
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,750
It has been extinct
for 600,000 of our...

383
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,458
of our years.

384
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,166
These...

385
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,667
these planets
were once...

386
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,000
outposts...

387
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,750
of that empire...

388
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,458
Data, what are you doing?

389
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,083
Apologies, Captain.

390
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:01,667
I seem to have reached
an odd functional impasse.

391
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,542
I am, uh...

392
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,333
...stuck.

393
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,709
Then get unstuck
and continue with the briefing.

394
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,959
Yes, sir.

395
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,917
That is what
I'm trying to do, sir

396
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:15,709
but the solution eludes me.

397
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:17,250
My hero.

398
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,500
(<i> laughter</i> )

399
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:24,750
Continue, Commander.

400
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:29,291
Intriguing.

401
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,166
It...

402
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,792
it describes
the empire

403
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:36,083
as being highly advanced
and powerful

404
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,625
and capable
of actually moving stars.

405
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,417
Stars whose planets
are their defense system.

406
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:42,542
Correct, sir.

407
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,917
Outposts.

408
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:46,166
The planet below
was possibly one of them.

409
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,875
YAR:
Excuse the interruption,
Captain

410
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,875
but this may be worth it.

411
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,625
We're now receiving
a signal from the probe.

412
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,583
We'll take it here.

413
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,625
(<i> low whistle</i> )

414
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,041
Incredible!

415
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,834
There's our mysterious
"something," Captain.

416
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:04,709
It is a force field
of some kind.

417
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:07,500
Reaching up from
the planet's surface.

418
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,709
Amazing power.

419
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:10,458
Data, what does
the legend say

420
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,291
about the end
of the Tkon empire?

421
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,166
Their sun went supernova, sir.

422
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,959
Could this planet
have escaped that?

423
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:20,875
This planet may have been
the most distant outpost, sir

424
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,250
but it shows
no life-form readings.

425
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,208
We should take a look at it,
Number One.

426
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,375
Stand by with an away team.

427
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,834
RIKER:
And if the Ferengi

428
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,709
also realize
that the force field

429
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:32,875
emanates
from the planet, sir?

430
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,250
Mmm. That's a complication.

431
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,875
Maybe we should ask them
to join us in this.

432
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,875
Team up with
the Ferengi, sir?

433
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,208
We've been ordered
to learn all we can about them.

434
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,917
Do you know a better way?

435
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:46,875
Data.

436
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,458
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

437
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,875
<i>In orbit of a mysterious planet</i>
<i>whose unexplained force field</i>

438
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:05,000
<i>has seized us with a power</i>
<i>almost beyond imagination.</i>

439
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
<i>If there is a solution to this</i>

440
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,667
it almost certainly will involve
<i>cooperation from the Ferengi.</i>

441
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,458
Ship's power drain
is critical, Captain.

442
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,875
I must now shut down
our shields

443
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,000
to maintain
life-support systems.

444
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,500
Understood.

445
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:22,667
Open hailing frequencies.

446
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,667
Hailing frequencies
open, sir.

447
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,500
Ferengi vessel
from<i> Enterprise.</i>

448
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,834
Come in.

449
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,041
Your alien images
again shock us.

450
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,750
With regard to
the surrender

451
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,125
Daimon Tarr, the facts are
somewhat different.

452
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:40,542
Our own probe has already shown
us your trickery, hu-man.

453
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,750
We withdraw our surrender.

454
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,375
Agreed.

455
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:48,625
Perhaps you would agree to
a more productive relationship.

456
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,750
I prefer
a more profitable one, hu-man.

457
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,083
Yankee trader.

458
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,959
Explain what means
"Yankee traders."

459
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,291
He heard that?!

460
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:00,291
He recognizes
your interest in profit...

461
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,083
or is that
an incorrect assumption?

462
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,750
We seek only what is equitable.

463
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,959
What do you seek?

464
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,875
Why did you begin
by attacking us?

465
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,125
We did not attack you.

466
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,959
We gave chase
in order to recover

467
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,667
a Federation-owned
energy device...

468
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,375
Which we know is ours!

469
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,125
Your barbarous Federation
placed it on one of our planets.

470
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,709
On the contrary--

471
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:22,041
Gamma Tauri IV is recognized
by all civilized...

472
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,625
The Ferengi
are not uncivilized, hu-man!

473
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,417
Are you suggesting otherwise?

474
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:30,208
All I'm saying is that you
removed something

475
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,709
which clearly did not
belong to you.

476
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:36,458
Are you now calling us thieves?

477
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,125
On the contrary.

478
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,583
I have no wish to discuss issues
of property or of territory

479
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,333
while our mutual
problem remains.

480
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,917
Like it or not

481
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:45,583
we are both trapped

482
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:50,041
by this energy-draining
force field from the planet.

483
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:57,875
On that matter,
there can be no argument.

484
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:01,000
I would like to propose a swap.

485
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,125
And what is a "swap"?

486
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,625
It's a trade--

487
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,959
an exchange.

488
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:07,375
Yes, trade, hu-man.

489
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,875
What do you offer?

490
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,000
We will tell you what
we know about the planet

491
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,542
and in trade, you will
give us your information.

492
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,792
Ridiculous! How do we know

493
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:17,750
you will not withhold
information.

494
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,500
We must trust each other, Tarr.

495
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,625
(<i> laughs</i> )

496
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,083
Amusing, hu-man.

497
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,917
"Trust" each other?

498
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:27,709
I propose that we test
this relationship

499
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:30,709
by cooperating
in a joint exploration

500
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:32,458
of the planet's surface.

501
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,250
And what profit
is in this Picard Captain?

502
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,792
The profit, Daimon Tarr,
of saving all our lives.

503
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:42,000
We will agree,
no doubt foolishly

504
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,291
but you are warned that any
further trickery on your part

505
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,792
will be met with no mercy.

506
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:46,875
Agreed.

507
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,333
If you care to join us

508
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,250
we have a well-proven
transporter device...

509
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,458
We have a matter-energy
device of our own.

510
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,417
We will beam a science
team of three

511
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,291
to whatever coordinates
you propose.

512
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:59,041
Excellent, we will transmit
the information shortly.

513
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,917
<i>Enterprise</i> out.

514
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,458
Hailing frequencies off.

515
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:09,166
I would log that agreement
as promising, at least.

516
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,583
I wonder, Captain.

517
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:13,375
I'm not usually one for
distrust at first sight

518
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,166
but this may be
an exception.

519
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,291
Especially in view
of the fact

520
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,875
that the image he
transmitted, sir

521
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,291
was somehow
distorted.

522
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:21,291
I sense
the same thing, Captain.

523
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,458
He's hiding something.

524
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,000
With this power drain,
we can't delay.

525
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,291
Now, I'd like some
additional help

526
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,500
in case we run
into trouble.

527
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,583
Can you spare Worf?

528
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:29,625
Take him.

529
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:33,291
And be careful, Number One.

530
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,083
DATA:
With this power drain
we may have trouble

531
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,875
communicating with
the<i> Enterprise,</i> sir.

532
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,875
Understood.
Anything else?

533
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,333
Due to this
force field

534
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,417
there is presently
no way to beam us back, sir.

535
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:55,709
Oh, you had to ask.

536
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:57,125
Understood.

537
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,250
Energize.

538
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:07,417
(<i> explosive thunder</i> )

539
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,458
Tasha!

540
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,166
Data!

541
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,625
Geordi!

542
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,250
Worf!

543
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:52,458
Anybody!

544
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,792
Data?

545
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,625
What are you
doing up there?

546
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,583
Most intriguing, sir.

547
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,375
I assume a problem
of inaccurately

548
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,875
transmitted program
coordinates

549
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,250
due to the force field
around the ship, sir.

550
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,375
Are we alone, sir?

551
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:31,875
Unfortunately.

552
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,125
Let's find the others.

553
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:42,000
What do you make of these?

554
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,875
Crystalline.

555
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,208
Mostly inert.

556
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,500
Nothing to write home about.

557
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,041
Excuse me?

558
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,625
Slang, sir.

559
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:56,625
I did use it
correctly, did I not?

560
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:01,625
They've got to be around here
somewhere.

561
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,208
What's that?

562
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,417
What?

563
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:14,583
That!

564
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:16,000
Geordi!

565
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,625
Are you conscious?

566
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,250
Do I look conscious?

567
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,375
What are you doing?

568
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,750
I'm resting, sir.

569
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,417
My foot stuck--

570
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:29,500
up there!

571
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
I materialized
upside down

572
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,375
above the planet surface.

573
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,792
DATA:
Tricorder's
useless, sir.

574
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:36,500
Communication's
gone, too.

575
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,750
Fortunately, you
did not break...

576
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,834
Data?

577
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:41,208
Hmm?

578
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:42,458
Data, who's that?

579
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,125
Who are you?

580
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,333
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

581
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,917
<i>It is now six hours since</i>
<i>our away team beamed down</i>

582
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:19,875
<i>to the planet's surface.</i>

583
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,417
<i>On the</i> Enterprise

584
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:23,291
<i>our condition</i>
<i>is rapidly worsening.</i>

585
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:26,000
<i>Ordinarily,</i>
<i>with reserve power alone</i>

586
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,333
<i>we could maintain life support</i>
<i>for several months</i>

587
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:32,458
<i>but the force holding us</i>
<i>has closed down all engines</i>

588
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:35,834
<i>and is draining</i>
<i>our reserve power, too.</i>

589
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:38,041
It's getting much,
much, much colder, sir.

590
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,083
How far down is
it likely to go?

591
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,250
A lot.

592
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,458
Even in orbital space

593
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,375
it'll get below
minus 200 degrees.

594
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,166
We won't have to worry much
past minus 70 or so.

595
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,792
Feels like that now.

596
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:50,458
Good, thank you.

597
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:27,709
LETEK:
If he moves,
kill him.

598
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:31,583
Has what
we've done

599
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:34,417
broken our agreement
with their Captain?

600
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,542
We will accuse
the humans

601
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:39,417
of preparing
to ambush us.

602
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:44,625
It will be our word
against theirs.

603
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,625
And who is more
trustworthy, Mordoc?

604
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,458
It looks like gold.

605
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:55,667
Tastes like gold.

606
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,375
RIKER:
It is gold.

607
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:00,375
(<i> thunder crashing loudly</i> )

608
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,917
(<i> screams</i> )

609
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:04,792
(<i> screams</i> )

610
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,291
Accursed planet.

611
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:08,166
It's nothing compared
to what our Captain will do

612
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,792
when he finds out you've broken
our landing party agreement.

613
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:13,500
What part of
the agreement?

614
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,625
You appeared and
attacked<i> us.</i>

615
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,375
Are you one
of their assassins?

616
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,750
I am Commander William Riker,
First Officer

617
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,500
of the USS
<i>Enterprise.</i>

618
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,625
You have a lot
to learn.

619
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,375
I've got this one!

620
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:38,166
Careful, Commander,
they're much stronger than...

621
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,750
Pygmy cretins!

622
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,000
Kill them.

623
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,417
Hideous monsters!

624
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:55,959
No!

625
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:58,834
Good.

626
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:02,083
You've heard
of phasers.

627
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,834
Now, over there.

628
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:09,583
Is this a female?

629
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:13,667
A human female, Letek?

630
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:16,125
It is true.

631
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:19,500
You work with your females

632
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,875
arm them and force them
to wear clothing.

633
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,500
Sickening.

634
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:35,667
I've diverted
the reserve power

635
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,125
down here to
the family decks.

636
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,041
They'll last longest.

637
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,458
Is there anything else
we can do, Doctor?

638
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,125
Where is Wesley?

639
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,667
He's in our quarters.

640
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:59,208
I was tempted
to give him a sedative.

641
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:00,792
You shouldn't.

642
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:03,000
I know, but he's my son.

643
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,583
I love him.

644
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,542
He has the right
to meet death awake.

645
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:13,709
Is that a male perspective?

646
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:16,959
Rubbish.

647
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,458
Hold it right there.

648
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,792
YAR:
Stop.

649
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:26,500
Stop!

650
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,792
Phasers on stun.

651
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:29,291
Already set.

652
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,250
What's going on?

653
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:44,375
What is this?

654
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,875
I believe
we can deduce

655
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,625
these crystalline
tree-shapes

656
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,458
are actually energy
collectors.

657
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,417
Along the same principle

658
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:58,250
as that which is draining
energy from our ships.

659
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,917
But the Ferengi whips were
working when we first arrived.

660
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:03,333
Which means something
new has happened.

661
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,542
LA FORGE:
I'm finally beginning
to understand

662
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:07,041
what my eyes have been
showing me.

663
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:10,166
It's patterns of force
everywhere.

664
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:13,959
This entire planet has been
turned into a power accumulator.

665
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,166
And these?

666
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,792
It's the whole point
of this place.

667
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:19,917
I can see the planet's power
emanating from...

668
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,709
Commander.

669
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,667
PORTAL:

Him.

<i>You have awakened</i>

<i>A guardian</i>

679
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,667
Biped, excellent.

680
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:34,291
Why would we
petition to enter

681
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:37,417
an empire that
no longer exists?

The empire is forever.

684
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:46,625
Your empire fell prey
to a supernova.

685
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,834
We are forever.

686
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:52,083
Data.

687
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,166
Please repeat
the file.

688
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,500
It is a matter
of record, Portal.

689
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,875
In the age of Makto

690
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:00,125
the central star
of the Tkon empire

691
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,291
destabilized...

692
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:04,417
There has never been
an age of Makto.

693
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:06,500
In fact, there
have been many ages

694
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,500
which have come and
passed since Makto.

695
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,917
This is the age
of Bastu.

696
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:13,125
I'm afraid not.

697
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:15,041
According to the Tkon use

698
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:17,834
of the galactic motionary
startime charts

699
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:20,041
after Bastu came Cimi

700
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,750
Xora, Makto...

701
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,166
Enough!

702
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:24,750
Absurdities.

703
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,000
You must have
been asleep, Portal

704
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,291
for hundreds
of thousands of our years.

705
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:36,250
Deception is
the way of the human.

706
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,083
We Ferengi will gladly

707
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:41,250
make a petition.

708
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,625
We invite
your petition.

709
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:44,834
Speak.

710
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:50,208
FERENGI:
We wish to offer
our services

711
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,000
to serve the Tkon empire

712
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,083
at no profit.

713
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,625
Return control
of our starship to us

714
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:03,375
and we will
happily destroy

715
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,959
the human criminals

716
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:08,750
and their vessel
which attacked us

717
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,875
without provocation.

718
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:14,000
They came to loot
your empire

719
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
but...

720
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,208
we intercepted them.

721
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:22,750
You are accused
of deceit and treachery.

722
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,583
Do you give yourself up
for judgment?

723
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,208
RIKER:
Yes.

724
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,667
If you believe these accusations

725
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,333
then you certainly should act
on them.

726
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,125
And there is even more.

727
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,417
We can prove

728
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:39,000
that the humans

729
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,291
are destroyers
of legal commerce.

730
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:45,417
And that they
selfishly withhold

731
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:49,125
vital technology
from backward worlds.

732
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:52,875
And necessary defensive
weapons, too.

733
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:55,709
We Ferengi are
now challenge

734
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:58,417
this human
madness.

735
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:01,041
I admit we withheld
modern technologies

736
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,291
from some worlds.

737
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,125
You see,
they are demented.

738
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,750
Their values are insane.

739
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,083
You cannot believe

740
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,375
the business opportunities
they have destroyed.

741
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:12,041
Proof of their
barbarism--

742
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:15,166
they adorn
themselves

743
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,500
with gold.

744
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,000
A despicable use of
the valuable metal.

745
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,792
And they
shamelessly

746
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:26,709
clothe their females.

747
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:28,792
Inviting others
to unclothe them.

748
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:31,458
The very depth
of perversion.

749
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,166
Paws off, Ferengi!

750
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,500
No female--
human or Ferengi

751
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,250
can order
Mordoc around.

752
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,458
Submit.

753
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,917
Just try it,
shorty.

754
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,333
At ease, Lieutenant.

755
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:55,000
And we still have more faults.

756
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,959
They should add
that Starfleet

757
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,083
has permitted several
civilizations to fall.

758
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,709
We have at times
allowed the strong

759
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,458
and violent to
overcome the weak.

760
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:05,750
They admit their crimes.

761
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,000
Hear them.

762
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,333
They admit the evil
that they do.

763
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,542
Barbarian.

764
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:16,667
Yes, you show wisdom.

765
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:19,083
Barbarians, all.

766
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,667
But this one first.

767
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,583
In the fashion

768
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:27,959
the empire has always
challenged savages.

769
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,542
No!

770
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:30,667
For battle, come to me!

771
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:31,834
No!

772
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:33,250
That's an order.

773
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,583
PORTAL:
You have a single
chance for life.

774
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,208
One only.

775
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:41,041
What is the answer
to my challenge?

776
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,875
I offer a thought.

777
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:47,709
"He will triumph
who knows when to fight

778
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:49,917
and when not to fight."

779
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,083
You are being tested, Riker.

780
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:01,125
What is the answer?

781
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:03,250
How do you
know my name?

782
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,041
Ah...

783
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:17,083
You are facing fate
with composure.

784
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,458
But what is the answer
to my challenge?

785
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:27,583
Fear is the true enemy,
the only enemy.

786
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:32,625
Unlike these little ones
who close their minds

787
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:36,709
your mind holds
interesting thoughts.

788
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:39,583
"Know your enemy
and know yourself

789
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:42,417
and you will always
be victorious."

790
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:44,417
Why that thought?

791
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:48,125
And who is this Sun Tzu
you revere?

792
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:52,291
An old Chinese
philosopher

793
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:55,000
from ancient
Earth history.

794
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,583
You must tell me more
of this wisdom--

795
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,083
so much
like our own.

796
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,583
Gladly, but first,
our starship.

797
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,375
Can you release it?

798
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,458
It is released.

799
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:08,166
All power
is restored.

800
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:31,542
Not a moment
too soon, Jean.

801
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:39,125
I mean, Captain.

802
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,458
I admit, I had
my doubts

803
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,291
as your ships
battled each other

804
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,542
in overt acts
of belligerence.

805
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:04,041
Normally, I would
have destroyed

806
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:06,500
all of you
and your ships

807
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,291
but something
confused me.

808
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:10,875
Which was?

809
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:13,583
First, you wanted
to destroy each other

810
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:17,000
then you were willing
to assist each other.

811
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,959
What of our vessel?

812
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,500
We knew
the same answer.

813
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,166
The truth
is I gave

814
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,917
those words
to this human.

815
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:27,875
What of them?

816
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:31,083
Shall I
destroy them?

817
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:33,041
Then they would
learn nothing.

818
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:36,291
A most interesting
conclusion.

819
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:40,208
But what if they
never learn, Riker?

820
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,375
Is this a test also?

821
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:46,041
In life, one is
always tested.

822
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:49,500
I see them much as we were
several hundred years ago.

823
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,375
But possessing the technology
they now have

824
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:53,792
they're very dangerous.

825
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:54,959
Untrue.

826
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,917
We seek friendship
with you.

827
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:59,250
But we can hardly hate
what we once were.

828
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,458
They may grow and learn.

829
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,458
And learn ways
to destroy you.

830
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,417
Well, our values
require us

831
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,875
to face that
possibility.

832
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,250
What of you?

833
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,250
With your
empire gone?

834
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:18,417
The universe exists
to me to create life.

835
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:21,667
I shall sleep...

836
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,125
until needed again.

837
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:30,000
(<i> explosive thunder</i> )

838
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,583
Compliments,
Lieutenant.

839
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,583
Thank you.

840
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,709
Lieutenant Worf.

841
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,291
You've done well.

842
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:57,834
Something to write
home about.

843
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,083
"Something to write
home about"?

844
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:03,083
Data, that's very human.

845
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:04,417
The T-9 energy converter

846
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:06,542
has been beamed aboard
and secured, sir.

847
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:08,792
The Ferengi complained bitterly,
but one final roar

848
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:10,583
from Portal
convinced them.

849
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:12,709
I commend your performance,
Number One.

850
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:14,291
One final request, sir.

851
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:18,208
Permission to beam a box of
Data's Chinese finger puzzles

852
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,667
over to the Ferengi.

853
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:22,417
A "thank you" for all
they tried to do.

854
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,542
Make it so.

855
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:33,542
Set course,
La Forge.
