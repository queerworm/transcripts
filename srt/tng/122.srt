1
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,834
All hands, this is the Captain.

2
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:14,792
As you may know,
a sun in the Delos System

3
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:17,458
is undergoing large-scale
magnetic field changes

4
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,000
producing violent
gigantic flares.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,667
Now, we shall be studying
this star at close range.

6
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:25,250
Even though we shall be running
with full deflectors

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,375
the closeness of
this event and its severity

8
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,458
will create problems.

9
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,208
Intense
magnetic fields

10
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:35,166
have a disruptive effect
on electrical systems.

11
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,250
Therefore,
we can expect

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,834
communication interruptions

13
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:40,125
as well as potential temporary
loss of other systems.

14
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,583
As a precaution, we are
now going to yellow alert.

15
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,125
Stay sharp, everyone.

16
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,583
COMPUTER:
Attention all decks.

17
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,875
Yellow alert.

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,208
Engineering, this is
Lieutenant Commander Data.

19
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,500
Bring all systems on-line

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,417
and direct full power
to the shields.

21
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:57,875
All sections secure, sir.

22
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,041
Lieutenant La Forge?

23
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,166
Course is set, Captain.

24
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,250
Half impulse.

25
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,208
Aye, sir,
one half impulse.

26
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,667
On main viewer.

27
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,291
Mask out the photosphere.

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,792
Magnify quadrant zero-seven

29
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,625
magnification
factor 12.

30
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,959
I've never seen anything
like this before.

31
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:39,417
The violence of those
eruptions is awesome.

32
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:41,417
Captain, I'm reading
an unusual number

33
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:44,709
of sunspots
and eruptive prominences, sir.

34
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:47,041
The magnetic field
is extremely...

35
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,583
irregular.

36
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:58,417
Captain, deflectors are being
hit by huge bursts of X rays.

37
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,166
Wow.

38
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,625
Look.

39
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,667
Captain, my console seems
to be overloading.

40
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,792
The X ray burst
is disrupting systems, Captain.

41
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,208
I'm adjusting
deflectors

42
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,542
to compensate.

43
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:22,500
WORF:
Engineering, increase power
to forward shields.

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Forward deflectors on line, sir.

45
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,959
Status report.

46
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,125
All systems operational, sir.

47
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:40,166
Captain, the level
of tension on the
ship is mounting.

48
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,542
Understandable.

49
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:47,375
Mr. Data?

50
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,834
If we are to investigate, sir,
we must get closer.

51
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:53,542
Mr. La Forge...

52
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:54,792
move us in closer.

53
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:56,125
Aye, sir.

54
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,834
This is the Captain.

55
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:01,208
We will be pushing the
shields to the limit

56
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:05,208
but we are getting
a splendid view
of this phenomenon.

57
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:10,083
Captain, I've intercepted what
appears to be a distress signal.

58
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,166
Let me hear it.

59
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,625
(<i> static</i> )

60
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,166
This is T'Jon.

61
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,542
I am on the Ornaran freighter
<i>Sanction.</i>

62
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:19,959
We have a serious problem here
and can't seem to fix it.

63
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,291
(<i> static</i> )

64
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,125
We need help.

65
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,417
The transmission is coming
from a freighter in orbit

66
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,750
around the fourth planet
in the system.

67
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,333
However, the receiving station

68
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,583
is on the third
planet.

69
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,041
Open hailing frequencies.

70
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,875
Hailing
frequencies open.

71
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:40,375
Unidentified freighter,
this is the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

72
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,166
May we be of assistance?

73
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,542
Whoever you are, yes.

74
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,709
I'm having trouble navigating.

75
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,917
Can't maintain a steady course.

76
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,834
Please help us if you can.

77
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:53,291
Can't you enhance the frequency?

78
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,917
Too much interference.

79
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:58,250
Set course to intersect with
the freighter-- warp two.

80
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,417
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir.

81
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:01,166
Maintain yellow alert.

82
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,792
I can't control the helm
any longer.

83
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,750
Our ship is losing orbit.

84
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,500
We're heading
into the atmosphere.

85
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,750
Please do something.

86
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,291
We're going to burn up!

87
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,625
We haven't much time.

88
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:35,834
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

89
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:40,333
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

90
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

91
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:46,083
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

92
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:50,625
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

93
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:55,375
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

94
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,041
It is a freighter-- very old.

95
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,834
Captain, our sensors are
being severely affected

96
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,750
by the sun flares.

97
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,333
Helm, take us in
as close as possible

98
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,542
to the freighter's orbit.

99
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,000
Moving in, sir.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,959
There are six life-forms
aboard the freighter, sir.

101
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,792
Captain, the freighter's orbit
is decaying.

102
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,500
How long before
it loses integrity?

103
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,542
A matter of minutes.

104
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:30,583
Unidentified freighter,
this is the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

105
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,083
T'JON:
<i>Enterprise</i>

106
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,709
this is the Ornaran
freighter<i> Sanction.</i>

107
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:36,333
Put this on the main viewer.

108
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:40,917
(<i> static</i> )

109
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,667
The visual transmission
is still breaking up.

110
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,667
Freighter<i> Sanction,</i>
this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

111
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,792
What is your situation?

112
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,834
Oh, not so good.

113
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,375
The helm isn't working right.

114
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,208
(<i> many voices speaking at once)</i>

115
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,458
This is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

116
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,959
With all this interference

117
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,500
it is difficult to copy
your transmission.

118
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,166
If you all talk at once,
it is almost impossible.

119
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:15,000
Now, please, say again
what is your situation?

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,250
I am T'Jon,
Captain of the<i> Sanction.</i>

121
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,458
At last.

122
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,333
How can we help?

123
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:27,250
We have lost...
I don't know, something.

124
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,875
I am no longer able
to maintain this orbit

125
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:33,250
nor am I able
to use the main thrusters.

126
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,333
It's all, you know,
dead I guess.

127
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:40,709
It's all... shut down.

128
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,291
Well, that is
a little vague.

129
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,375
What is the computer
analysis?

130
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:50,083
Well, the computer's
not working very well.

131
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,750
Data, can you tap
into their computer

132
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,000
and clarify
the situation?

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,834
I will attempt it, sir.

134
00:07:55,834 --> 00:08:00,083
Captain, the tractor beam is
available, if you want it.

135
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,417
At least, we can pull them
out of orbit

136
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,959
before they enter
the atmosphere.

137
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,959
Freighter, we're going to
lock on the tractor beam

138
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,291
and pull you
out of orbit.

139
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,792
Hey, that's great.

140
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,917
(<i> beam trying to power up</i> )

141
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,417
Captain, the freighter's orbit
continues to deteriorate.

142
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,542
The solar flares are interfering
with the tractor beam, Captain.

143
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,500
I can't lock on.

144
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,750
Captain T'Jon, we are unable
to attach the tractor beam

145
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,083
because of the intense
solar activity.

146
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,625
I understand.

147
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,375
Thanks for trying.

148
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,583
Sir, I have determined what is
malfunctioning on the freighter.

149
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,333
Captain, we
have analyzed
your problem.

150
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,333
Great.

151
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,792
Data.

152
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,709
Your ship's design uses
an electromagnetic coil

153
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,625
to constrict the exhaust flow.

154
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,333
That coil is misaligned.

155
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,875
Really?

156
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,250
Do you have the necessary
tools to realign the coil?

157
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,709
I don't think so.

158
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:54,959
I believe, Captain,
we can provide them

159
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,083
with a temporary substitute.

160
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,166
Our ship's stores contain

161
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,333
a coil of the proper type.

162
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,333
Can we beam one over?

163
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,709
Yes.

164
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,166
Captain, we are beaming over
a replacement coil.

165
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,041
That's great.

166
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,333
And that will fix us up?

167
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,291
Yes, once it's installed.

168
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,667
Right.

169
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,917
And how do we do that?

170
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:18,917
What is the matter
with these people?

171
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:20,333
How can he be captain
of that vessel

172
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,458
and not understand

173
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,333
its simplest
function?

174
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,625
Captain, how long
have you been

175
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,917
in command of
this freighter?

176
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:27,375
Seven years.

177
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,834
This is my 26th voyage
to Brekka.

178
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,417
And you don't know how
to align a control coil?

179
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,750
It's never come up.

180
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,625
Can anyone else
over there do it?

181
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,250
Hold on. I'll ask.

182
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:49,458
Sorry, nobody here
knows anything about it.

183
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,750
I'd better get over there
with a team.

184
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,375
Captain,
I strongly

185
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,417
recommend against anyone
from the ship beaming over.

186
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:56,583
The solar interference
is too great.

187
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,750
WORF:
The freighter has entered
the planet's atmosphere.

188
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,834
Disintegration is imminent.

189
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,291
We're running out
of options.

190
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,500
Let's get them off there.

191
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,792
T'Jon, stand by to beam over.

192
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,959
If you think that's best.

193
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,834
Unless you have
any other options

194
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:13,500
yes, I think that's best.

195
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,917
Whatever you say.

196
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,583
I can't maintain
a positive lock.

197
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,000
Unusual E.M. burst, sir.

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,834
Readings off scale.

199
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,959
Freighter<i> Sanction,</i>
this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

200
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,333
We're having difficulty
getting a fix.

201
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,959
Have them go
to their own transporter room.

202
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,250
It will be tricky
but perhaps I can link

203
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,750
the two transporters
in series

204
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,959
and get them over
with the increased power.

205
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,375
That's worth a try.

206
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,917
Captain T'Jon, go
to your transporter room.

207
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,291
Contact me from there.

208
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,750
Right,<i> Enterprise.</i>

209
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,375
It's right next door

210
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,333
but, if you can't get us

211
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,709
with your transporter

212
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:56,000
what makes you think
ours will do the job?

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,625
I'm going to interconnect them.

214
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,917
I didn't know you could do that.

215
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:00,917
Hurry!
We're running out of time.

216
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,250
We're on our way.

217
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,125
I don't think
they're going to make it.

218
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,333
Captain T'Jon doesn't
sound like he cares

219
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,875
one way
or the other.

220
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,125
(<i> beeping</i> )
Worf, how much time do we have?

221
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,792
WORF:
One minute, 28 seconds.

222
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,250
Captain T'Jon, are you there?

223
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,667
We're in the transporter room.

224
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,083
Great, activate
your transporter.

225
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,083
Set coordinates
nine-seven-zero-three

226
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,625
mark two-six-eight.

227
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:21,458
Did you say two-eight-six
or eight-eight-six?

228
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,583
Mark<i> two-six-eight.</i>

229
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,166
Got it.

230
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,709
Sir, the hull temperature
of the freighter

231
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:29,166
is passing
3,000 degrees.

232
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,667
What's the holdup,
Number One?

233
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:33,041
We're establishing
the link right now.

234
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,542
We're ready.

235
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,709
Then all six of you get
on the transporter platform.

236
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,792
On my signal, energize.

237
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:40,458
I've got their initial
transporter signal

238
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,834
interlock complete.

239
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,000
Energize on my mark.

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,834
Four, three, two,
one... energize.

241
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,375
PICARD:
Number One,
did you get them off?

242
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,208
No, sir, they stayed
on the freighter

243
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,500
but they beamed over
their cargo.

244
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,166
Cargo?

245
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,417
Are those people crazy?

246
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,792
What could possibly
be so important?

247
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:19,041
Sir, the freighter
is disintegrating.

248
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,917
Their lives are in danger
and they're beaming over cargo?

249
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,875
Number One, I don't understand
these people.

250
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,625
Captain, freighter's
hull temperature

251
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,375
is approaching critical.

252
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,917
Unbelievable.

253
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,291
PICARD:
We're losing the freighter.

254
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,166
We've got to beam
those people over now.

255
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,458
Clear the cargo,
beam it to a hold.

256
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,709
Aye, sir.

257
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,250
RIKER:
Freighter<i> Sanction,</i>
this is the<i> Enterprise</i>

258
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,917
get to your transporter...
No, forget about that.

259
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,166
Lock onto any life-form
you can find

260
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,500
and get them
over here now.

261
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,917
Trying, sir.

262
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:58,959
The freighter is going down.

263
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,083
Transporter room,
you're out of time.

264
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,500
Reading six life-forms,
but I can't get a solid lock.

265
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,542
We have no choice.

266
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:05,875
Energize.

267
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,625
I thought you said
there were six.

268
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,125
Where are the other two?
The lock didn't hold.

269
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,291
Reestablish.
It's too late.

270
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,917
Number One?

271
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,333
Two are lost, sir

272
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,375
but we saved four.

273
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:35,291
I'm Commander William Riker
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

274
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,875
I'm sorry we were unable
to rescue the other two.

275
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,375
We did everything we could.

276
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,542
If you had come instead
of sending your cargo

277
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,083
you all would
have made it.

278
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,458
The cargo-- where is it?

279
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,208
You did save it, didn't you?

280
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,250
Yes, we did.

281
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,583
It's in one of our cargo holds.

282
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,834
You act as if
it's more important

283
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,500
than your comrades.

284
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,625
The cargo--
may we see it?

285
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,959
Follow me.

286
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,333
Thank you. Thank you.

287
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,875
We thought we had lost it.

288
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,041
Careful with your
choice of words, T'Jon.

289
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,291
It's ours, not yours.

290
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,542
We paid a fair
price for it.

291
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:23,500
You offered a fair price.
We have not received it.

292
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,125
You accepted our
goods in trade.

293
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,583
Then where are they, hmm?

294
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,000
Tell me.

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,208
That's not our problem.

296
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,959
No more than the barrel
is your property.

297
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,250
It's as simple as this--

298
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,208
the goods were
never delivered.

299
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,667
They were destroyed
with your ship.

300
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,250
Hence the deal
was incomplete

301
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,959
hence possession of
the felicium remains ours.

302
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,875
We need it.

303
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,875
Commander, I request
you transport

304
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,125
my associate and myself
down to Brekka

305
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,542
with our
merchandise.

306
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:53,625
T'JON:
Yes!

307
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,333
Get them out of here.

308
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,834
But the barrel stays.

309
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:59,583
There's no
reasoning with you.

310
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,875
Langor, you expect
too much from them.

311
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,083
You always have

312
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,125
and you've always
been disappointed.

313
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,083
You didn't pay for it.

314
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,667
Therefore,
it's not yours.

315
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,542
Damn you, Sobi.

316
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:14,458
Ah!

317
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,583
(<i> grunting</i> )

318
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,125
Stop this.

319
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,500
Now!

320
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,583
RIKER:
Security
to Cargo Bay 11.

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,542
Behave yourselves,
gentlemen.

322
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,917
Escort our visitors
to the observation lounge.

323
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,375
A natural
electrical charge?

324
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,667
Formidable.

325
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:08,208
Yes, and a difficult
weapon to confiscate.

326
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,333
I have never
seen humanoids
with that power.

327
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,333
Neither have I.

328
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,875
I wonder
how it evolved.

329
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,000
I wonder if the strong magnetic
field of their sun

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
might have something
to do with it.

331
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,500
Could be.

332
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,125
I wonder how much power
our guests can produce.

333
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,750
Or if they need
to recharge.

334
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,125
It's an interesting
ability.

335
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,750
The question is,
how do I defend
against it?

336
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,375
Do you think our visitors
pose a threat?

337
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,750
I don't know, but if
they do, I'd better
be ready for it.

338
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,125
Precisely, Lieutenant.

339
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,166
We have to resolve
this soon.

340
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,291
There isn't much time.

341
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,834
What can you offer?

342
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:49,834
Everything we had
went down with
the<i> Sanction.</i>

343
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:53,542
Then it's going
to be difficult
to accommodate you.

344
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,583
Solar flares increasing
in magnitude, Captain.

345
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,083
Shields are shaky,
but they're holding.

346
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,333
Maintain.

347
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,625
How are our rather
quarrelsome guests?

348
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,500
They're waiting for you
in the observation lounge, sir.

349
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,834
Data, what information
can you give us

350
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,625
about the inhabitants
of this system?

351
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,166
Not very much, sir.

352
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,166
The only recorded contact
with the Delos system

353
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,917
was over 200 years ago.

354
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,458
A scout ship reported
two inhabited planets--

355
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,208
one of which was on the verge
of acquiring space travel.

356
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,041
Ah, then, in two centuries,
neither civilization

357
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,792
advanced much further.

358
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:28,000
Sir, I find it strange
that none of our visitors

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,417
feels much remorse

360
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,792
about the two freighter
passengers who perished.

361
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,291
Yet that barrel of cargo

362
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,500
is a source of great
anxiety to them.

363
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,375
Mm-hmm, yes, let's pay a call,
get some answers.

364
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,709
Number One, Mr. Data.

365
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:41,250
Mr. La Forge,
you have the bridge.

366
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,583
Aye, sir.

367
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,458
Captain, may I present Sobi and
Langor from the planet Brekka

368
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,333
and T'Jon and Romas
from Ornara.

369
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,291
I'm sorry we couldn't
save your ship.

370
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,792
Tell me, you could
have repaired it?

371
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:04,750
PICARD:
Oh, yes.

372
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,542
We have only two left,
and neither works properly.

373
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,500
They are critical
to our survival.

374
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,000
Will you fix them?

375
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,458
Mr. Data?

376
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,417
Our computer has downloaded
the specifications

377
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:17,500
for the magnetic coils
the freighters depend on.

378
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,041
Assuming the malfunction
is similar

379
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,166
suitable
replacements

380
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:24,000
can be
fabricated.

381
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,667
Instruct Engineering
to proceed.

382
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:26,875
DATA:
Aye, sir.

383
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,041
Now, as for our cargo...

384
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,959
<i>Our</i> cargo, Captain.

385
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,834
Wrong, Sobi.

386
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:37,500
My First Officer has said
that ownership of this cargo

387
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,208
is in dispute,
but this question
must be settled

388
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,500
by whatever legal machinery

389
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,583
exists
between your two societies.

390
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,083
Captain, you
don't understand.

391
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,417
This is a matter
of life and death.

392
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,458
Why is that?

393
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,917
What is this cargo?

394
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,583
Medicine.

395
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,875
Indeed.

396
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,125
Our planet is
in desperate need, Captain.

397
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,625
We have people suffering
from a lethal plague.

398
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,125
T'JON:
The cargo
you have impounded

399
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,917
is the only hope
of life for our people.

400
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,417
Is that so?

401
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,834
Yes.

402
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,667
You must think us
heartless brutes, Captain

403
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,375
but look at
our side of it.

404
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,041
The plant which yields
the medicine felicium

405
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,792
grows only in remote
areas of Brekka.

406
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:24,792
It must be painstakingly
cultivated, harvested

407
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:29,083
purified-- a complex
and expensive process.

408
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,917
That single shipment
of felicium

409
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:33,458
represents an
enormous investment.

410
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,875
We can't just
give it away.

411
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,000
We paid for it.

412
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,083
We ask for only what is ours.

413
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,291
That is
your viewpoint.

414
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,917
Ours, of course, differs.

415
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,375
You are going to hold
to that position?

416
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:50,583
I am constrained to abide
by the terms of our agreement.

417
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,875
Then you condemn
us to death!

418
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,000
Romas...

419
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,458
You disgust me!

420
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,333
If you could see the suffering
the plague has caused.

421
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,709
Well, you are going to

422
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,792
when you see
what it does to us.

423
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:18,667
Romas, are you and T'Jon
carrying this plague?

424
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,834
Yes.

425
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,083
Every Ornaran does.

426
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,291
Then you may have
brought it aboard this ship.

427
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,458
Was there a medical scan
when they transported?

428
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,959
Unverified.

429
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,166
The solar flares could have
caused a malfunction

430
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,458
in the biofilter.

431
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,834
(<i> sighing</i> )

432
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,000
Med alert.

433
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,250
Medical emergency--
Dr. Crusher

434
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,250
to the observation
lounge at once.

435
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,208
You find us well,
I trust.

436
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,834
As far as I can tell.

437
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,709
Your physiology
is somewhat different

438
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,417
than I've ever encountered

439
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:08,000
but I detect no dangerous
virus or bacteria.

440
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,125
I assure you we're
in perfect health.

441
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,417
But we
are not.

442
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,917
We need
our medicine.

443
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,208
<i>Our</i> medicine.

444
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,917
We paid for it,
it's ours now.

445
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:18,166
Enough.

446
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,333
Of course.

447
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,792
You are right, Doctor.

448
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,709
Could we leave now?

449
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:27,625
I see no
reason why not.

450
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,208
Escort them
to their quarters.

451
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,417
Doctor.

452
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:33,041
Captain, could I speak
with you, please?

453
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,792
In private.

454
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,333
Not right now.

455
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,166
Captain.

456
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,000
What have you learned?

457
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,417
The Brekkians show
no sign of infection.

458
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:53,625
The Ornarans show all
the symptoms of a disease

459
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,500
but I can't
find a cause.

460
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,250
Perhaps it was filtered out
by the transporter

461
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,333
when they were beamed aboard.

462
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,667
There's no
record of it

463
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,041
then again, the solar
flare activity

464
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,291
might have caused
a malfunction

465
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,667
in the biofilters
or their monitors.

466
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,166
Are they going to die?

467
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:10,375
I need to check further,
but my instinct says no.

468
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,500
Do you think that we're in
any danger from this plague?

469
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,875
Again, I need
more time.

470
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,000
There are some missing
pieces to this puzzle.

471
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,792
What's missing is
a little compassion.

472
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:23,083
We're losing our professional
detachment, Doctor.

473
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,208
Perhaps.

474
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,875
But, Captain,
I must tell you

475
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,959
I am developing a
very active dislike
for these Brekkians.

476
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,709
Understandable.

477
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:40,709
Captain, you must
give us back our cargo.

478
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,333
I can't do that.

479
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,291
Why? It belongs to us.

480
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,792
The Brekkians claim
it belongs to them.

481
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,625
They lie.

482
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,417
That may be so but...

483
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:52,417
it is not
my decision.

484
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:53,709
We need some now.

485
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:54,917
<i>Now.</i>

486
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't care if
it's your decision--

487
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,458
get us some.

488
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,792
Captain, what is
happening to us

489
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:01,041
is happening
to thousands
more on Ornara.

490
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,417
Please understand
the magnitude of the problem.

491
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:04,500
Your people
don't need it.

492
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,959
The Brekkians
don't need it.

493
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,750
Our people do.

494
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,500
If you don't give it to us,
you will be a party to murder--

495
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,542
not only of us

496
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:13,667
but of an entire
civilization.

497
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,458
I-I-I am sorry, I do not
mean to insult you.

498
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,667
I'm feeling very shaky.

499
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:27,166
We cannot hold out
much longer.

500
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,792
They believe it
will help them.

501
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,792
That in itself might
control their symptoms.

502
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:43,208
I'll talk
with the Brekkians.

503
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,667
We thank you, Captain.

504
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,750
We appreciate
anything you can do.

505
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

506
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,625
May I say, Captain,
how impressed we are

507
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:20,250
with your ship
and all its facilities?

508
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,291
Thank you.

509
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,583
And its crew.

510
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,041
Everyone is so efficient
and professional.

511
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,625
I'm glad you're comfortable.

512
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:30,041
I've come to seek your agreement
to an Ornaran request.

513
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,125
We cannot agree.

514
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:34,125
Wait, let the Captain speak.

515
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,583
We want to be
reasonable.

516
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,166
The two Ornarans
are really quite ill

517
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,834
and are insisting that
they need the felicium.

518
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:45,250
That is not surprising.

519
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,041
Would you object
to giving them enough

520
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:50,041
for their own
immediate needs?

521
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:53,667
Captain, we Brekkians
are in business.

522
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,458
We are not in the habit
of giving away

523
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,875
that which has not
been paid for.

524
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:01,291
You would see them die,
rather than share the medicine?

525
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,917
LANGOR:
We want to be
fair, Captain.

526
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:06,208
We agree to permitting
them two doses

527
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,041
for immediate use.

528
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,291
No charge.

529
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:14,000
I'll let my medical
officer handle it.

530
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,834
Captain...

531
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:17,166
I trust you won't mind

532
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,417
if we're present
while you open the cargo.

533
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:40,000
What does that device do?

534
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,917
This measures
the individual portions.

535
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,709
What's the dosage?

536
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:49,125
.01 milliliters.

537
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,959
A very potent substance.

538
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:55,166
We've improved our distillation
process over the years.

539
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,291
In my grandfather's day,
this same amount of felicium

540
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:00,417
would have filled
five rooms this size.

541
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:02,333
But, now with our
improved processes

542
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:06,333
this one barrel contains
over 4,000,000,000 doses.

543
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:09,625
I would estimate
4 billion, 375 million...

544
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:11,500
Thank you, Mr. Data.

545
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,250
How long is
the dosage effective?

546
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,208
LANGOR:
It varies with
the individual.

547
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,750
But never more
than 72 hours.

548
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,583
And then the symptoms return?

549
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:22,959
Yes.

550
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:25,208
Unfortunately, there is
no cure for the plague.

551
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:29,166
But felicium inhibits the
sickness with total efficiency.

552
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,834
Allowing the Ornarans
to lead normal lives.

553
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:35,625
An unusual disease--

554
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:39,250
virulent, extremely persistent

555
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,709
yet I can't
isolate it.

556
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:43,208
The plague has
baffled doctors

557
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,959
on both planets
for 200 years.

558
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:48,166
We've therefore concentrated
on treatment--

559
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,250
finding new ways
to improve the potency

560
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,875
and purity
of felicium.

561
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,667
DATA:
No doubt you have
applied your technology

562
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,875
from other industries to the
refinement of this product.

563
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,834
We have no other industry.

564
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:00,959
None at all?

565
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,500
We don't
need any.

566
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,750
The Ornarans provide us
with everything we need

567
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,625
in exchange for this.

568
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,041
Fascinating.

569
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,291
Your society
dedicated exclusively

570
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,375
to the production
of a single product.

571
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,417
A product for which
you have no use

572
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:17,333
but which the Ornarans
cannot live without.

573
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,959
One of life's little ironies,
Captain.

574
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:22,583
But one would be fools
not to take advantage of.

575
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:25,417
It's mutually beneficial.

576
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:28,917
The Ornarans provide us
with the necessities of life

577
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:32,250
and we provide them
with the necessities of living.

578
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,375
It is a fair exchange.

579
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,875
Interesting
relationship.

580
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:37,959
Excuse me.

581
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:38,959
I'll take that

582
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,291
to Sick Bay.

583
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,709
BEVERLY:
Can I help?

584
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:52,458
No...

585
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,625
Hurry up.

586
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,375
You're feeling better?

587
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:31,625
Yes, thank you.

588
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,291
I'm fine now.

589
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,125
(<i> door chimes</i> )

590
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,250
Come.

591
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:52,000
Doctor?

592
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,166
I may not know
felicium's full effect

593
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,709
on Ornaran physiology

594
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:56,875
but I know

595
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,250
how to interpret
physical reactions.

596
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,083
Are the Ornarans recovering?

597
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:04,083
T'Jon and Romas
are feeling fine.

598
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,834
In fact, too fine.

599
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:09,041
Felicium's a narcotic.

600
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,750
Then T'Jon and Romas

601
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,417
and everyone on their world...

602
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,959
Is a drug addict.

603
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,083
I think you'll find
it's a fascinating tale

604
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,542
that we've come across
here, Captain.

605
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:34,000
You've piqued my interest,
Number One.

606
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,125
Please continue.

607
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,583
Data, what have we got?

608
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,250
Beginning several
thousand years ago

609
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,208
the two planets
took different paths.

610
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,625
Ornara became technologically
sophisticated.

611
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,000
Brekka did not.

612
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,875
Then,
200 years ago

613
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:49,834
Ornara was stricken
by a devastating plague.

614
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:52,750
Their advanced technology
could provide no solution.

615
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,959
Somehow, and there is limited
information on this point

616
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,750
a cure was found in a plant

617
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,333
indigenous
only to Brekka

618
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,625
and which rejected

619
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,959
all attempts at cultivation
on Ornara.

620
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,667
In any case,
a trading situation developed

621
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,041
which still
exists.

622
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,125
A nice arrangement
for the Brekkians.

623
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,500
And for the Ornarans.

624
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,458
Without the medicine,
they would all die.

625
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:12,834
No, they wouldn't.

626
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,792
Despite what the Ornarans
have been saying

627
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,250
it is not a medicine.

628
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,500
It was a medicine

629
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,375
but it cured the plague
200 years ago.

630
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,750
The plague is irrelevant now.

631
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,291
It doesn't exist.

632
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,375
Then why are they so desperate

633
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,625
for the felicium?

634
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,083
It's an addiction.

635
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,667
The physical
and psychological
need is very real.

636
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,458
Thank you.

637
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,917
What are you
going to do?

638
00:30:37,917 --> 00:30:39,333
Based on what
we know so far

639
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,208
there's nothing I can do.

640
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,959
You don't think drug addiction
and exploitation

641
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,917
is sufficient cause
to do something?

642
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:48,500
This situation has existed
for a very long time.

643
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,709
These two societies
are intertwined

644
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:53,959
in a symbiotic relationship.

645
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,166
With one society

646
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:57,583
profiting at the expense
of the other.

647
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:00,750
That's how you see it.

648
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,125
I can synthesize
a non-addictive substitute

649
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:08,875
which will ease
their withdrawal symptoms.

650
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:12,375
No, I can't do that either.

651
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,792
You can't let them
have the felicium.

652
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:17,667
Why, because it offends
against our sensibilities?

653
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,500
It is not our mission to impose
Federation or Earth values

654
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,208
on any others in the galaxy.

655
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:28,417
Well, in this case, Captain,
I disagree 100 percent.

656
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,041
YAR:
Captain, I'm receiving a call

657
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,333
from Ornara.

658
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:32,792
The signal
is ragged,
but I think

659
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:34,375
I can put it
on the viewscreen.

660
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,625
PICARD:
Do it.

661
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:42,834
I'm Margan.

662
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,959
Are my people on board
your ship?

663
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:52,792
Some of them, yes.

664
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:55,667
May I speak to them?

665
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,000
Yes.

666
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,500
Lieutenant Yar, have
the Ornarans brought in.

667
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,875
No, wait.

668
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:05,208
I don't want them to have
access to the Bridge.

669
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,083
We will contact you
in a few minutes.

670
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:14,500
I will continue this
in the guest quarters.

671
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,333
Commander.
Doctor.

672
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,500
Data, I can understand

673
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,083
how this could happen
to the Ornarans.

674
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,667
What I can't understand

675
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:33,417
is why anyone
would voluntarily

676
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,583
become dependent
on a chemical.

677
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,208
DATA:
Voluntary
addiction to drugs

678
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,208
is a recurrent theme
in many cultures.

679
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:42,166
Wesley, no one wants
to become dependent.

680
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,542
That happens later.

681
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:45,000
But it does happen.

682
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So why do people start?

683
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,291
On my home planet

684
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,500
there was so much poverty
and violence

685
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,083
that for some, the only escape
was through drugs.

686
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:57,291
How can a chemical substance
provide an escape?

687
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,000
It doesn't

688
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
but it makes you think
it does.

689
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You have to understand

690
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,125
drugs can make you feel good.

691
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,709
They make you feel
on top of the world.

692
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:13,083
You're happy,
sure of yourself, in control.

693
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:14,667
But it's artificial.

694
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,208
It doesn't feel
artificial

695
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:19,000
until the drug
wears off.

696
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,709
Then you pay
the price.

697
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,041
Before you know it

698
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,959
you're taking the drug
not to feel good

699
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:27,291
but to keep from feeling bad.

700
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:28,709
And that's the trap.

701
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:31,583
All you care
about is getting
your next dosage.

702
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:35,333
Nothing else matters.

703
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,834
I guess I just don't understand.

704
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:41,000
Wesley, I hope you never do.

705
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,458
PICARD:
Lieutenant Yar, we're ready
in the guest quarters.

706
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,291
(<i> static</i> )

707
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:58,417
T'Jon?

708
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,125
Do you have it?

709
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:03,125
Yes, it is
here, but...

710
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,750
You've got to get it to us.

711
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,458
T'Jon, please.

712
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,250
We're dying down here.

713
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,458
You don't know, it's worse
than it's ever been before.

714
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:13,375
I'm doing
everything I can.

715
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:15,542
You see, what
happened was...

716
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:16,667
Stop!

717
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,875
I can't listen anymore!

718
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,125
T'Jon.

719
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,500
There's so many people here!

720
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,333
So much suffering.

721
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,583
We need the medicine.

722
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:28,750
You've got to get it to us!

723
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,709
I can't go on.

724
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:34,375
Help, T'Jon.

725
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:39,542
Please.

726
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:48,709
I'm sorry.

727
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:56,542
You will take us
to our planet

728
00:34:56,542 --> 00:35:00,041
and leave us there
with our medicine or
this person dies.

729
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,500
Don't you see,
I have no choice.

730
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,291
We were sent to bring
the felicium back.

731
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,208
The suffering
on my planet
is too great.

732
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,291
People are dying.

733
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,417
It doesn't matter

734
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:11,667
whether we're
entitled to it or not.

735
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,166
We must have it.

736
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,458
Let him go.

737
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,917
You will take us
there now.

738
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:18,375
Or give us a shuttle

739
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:21,583
but we must have
the medicine.

740
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:26,125
If you refuse,
this person will die.

741
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,250
I will not be coerced.

742
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,875
I will do it.

743
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,250
I will kill him.

744
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,458
No.

745
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,875
No, you won't.

746
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,417
You're not a killer.

747
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:53,208
Help us, please.

748
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,625
Help us.

749
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:02,333
I'm not sure that I can.

750
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,750
My insides are
still shaking

751
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,375
but I'm
all right.

752
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,542
(<i> door chimes</i> )

753
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,875
Captain Picard,
could I see you a moment?

754
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,667
I'll stay here.

755
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,875
PICARD:
Come with me,
Doctor.

756
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:34,667
This could be
interesting.

757
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:46,250
LANGOR:
We have thought
about this a great deal.

758
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,500
We both feel deeply

759
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,834
about what is
happening on Ornara.

760
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,083
And although
it is going to cause

761
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,792
hardship to us
and to our people

762
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:57,834
we have decided to give
the felicium to them.

763
00:36:57,834 --> 00:37:00,875
They can pay
whenever they are able.

764
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,166
We don't
want to be

765
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:04,959
the ones responsible
for their suffering.

766
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:07,625
There goes
the other shoe.

767
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,166
They know.

768
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,750
What do they know?

769
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,875
They know that the Ornarans
no longer have the plague.

770
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,041
They know
that felicium

771
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:16,291
is no longer
a medicine.

772
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:20,250
So, of course, they are willing
to<i> give</i> this shipment

773
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,917
because they don't want to take
the chance that the Ornarans

774
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:24,125
will lose
their addiction.

775
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:26,834
They don't want to lose
their only customers.

776
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,583
How would they have known
all of that

777
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:31,875
unless the plague had once
infected their planet, as well?

778
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,458
They were infected.

779
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,542
They used the felicium
to cure themselves

780
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:39,667
but, somehow, their ancestors
realized that it was a narcotic.

781
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,166
BEVERLY:
They broke the cycle
of addiction

782
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,083
and never told
the Ornarans?

783
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:44,667
They let them
continue to believe

784
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:47,250
that, without the felicium,
they would die?

785
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,959
PICARD:
I think it's worse
than that.

786
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:50,500
My guess
is that

787
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,041
this refining process,
of which you are so proud...

788
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:55,333
Is only to increase
the potency of the felicium

789
00:37:55,333 --> 00:38:00,125
and tighten
your grip.

790
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,959
What are you going to do?

791
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:04,542
Are you going
to tell them?

792
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:08,250
No, I'm bound by the rules of
the United Federation of Planets

793
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,500
which order me not to interfere

794
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,834
with other worlds,
other cultures.

795
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,208
If I were to tell them
any of this

796
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,959
I would violate
that Prime Directive.

797
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:19,500
But you are talking to us
about it.

798
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,917
This is information
you already know

799
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:23,917
and so nothing
is changed.

800
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,417
If you can't interfere

801
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:28,375
then you are going to allow
the Ornarans to have

802
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,458
the felicium.

803
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:31,917
Yes, I am.

804
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:34,375
No, don't do it.

805
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,875
Jean-Luc,
this is not

806
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,875
a symbiotic
relationship.

807
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:41,250
This is exploitation--
pure and simple.

808
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,583
The Brekkians have
caused all of this
suffering and hardship

809
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:46,000
only to make their
pitiful lives easier.

810
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,834
And all of it
based on a lie.

811
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:50,917
No, deny them
this shipment.

812
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:53,542
It is the least
we can do.

813
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:56,375
From the moment they agreed
to give them the felicium

814
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,083
my hands were tied.

815
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,834
LANGOR:
You are absolutely
right, Captain.

816
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:03,792
It's not your business.

817
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,000
T'JON:
Are these
the spare parts

818
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,917
for our freighters?

819
00:39:08,917 --> 00:39:10,417
They look
complicated.

820
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,667
Are they already...

821
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,625
Aligned?
Right.

822
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:16,667
You'd have to ask
the Captain.

823
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:21,083
LA FORGE:
Captain Picard,
we've arrived at Ornara

824
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:22,667
and assumed standard orbit.

825
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:24,000
Acknowledged.
Thank you.

826
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,125
Captain, please.

827
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,917
My planet
is suffering.

828
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:30,709
We beg you
to give us

829
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:32,375
our medicine.

830
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,917
The matter is already decided.

831
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:38,125
You're beaming down to your
world with the felicium.

832
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,417
Great.

833
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,500
(<i> laughing</i> )

834
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
I knew it.

835
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,375
I knew
you'd help us.

836
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:45,709
We thank you.

837
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,375
Don't thank me.

838
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,959
Sobi and Langor--

839
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:51,792
they decided
to let you
have it.

840
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:54,750
We'll discuss
the payment terms later.

841
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,291
In the meantime,
there's no reason

842
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,917
to deprive you
of your needed medicine.

843
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:00,542
That's terrific.

844
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:02,041
I'm sure
we can come

845
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:04,875
to a fair deal
for payment.

846
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:07,792
May we beam down with
you and discuss it?

847
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:09,583
Of course.

848
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,709
You are quite
welcome on Ornara.

849
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,709
We appreciate
your hospitality.

850
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:17,375
T'JON:
And Captain--

851
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:21,166
we appreciate
your gift of the coils.

852
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:23,333
Once our freighters
are fixed, everything

853
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,166
will be back
to normal.

854
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,041
No.

855
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,208
No?

856
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:30,917
The coils stay here.

857
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,583
What about
our freighters?

858
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:37,375
PICARD:
If you want
to repair them

859
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:40,959
you'll have to learn
to do it yourselves.

860
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,750
We can't.

861
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,083
If you don't help
us, our ships

862
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,917
will soon
be inoperable.

863
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:47,291
Quite possibly.

864
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:48,875
If you withhold those coils

865
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:52,375
you'll be disrupting the
stability of both our planets.

866
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,166
And interfering
with a trade agreement

867
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:56,583
that has lasted for generations.

868
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,667
What of your Prime Directive?

869
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,250
In this situation,
the Prime Directive

870
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,542
prohibits me from helping you.

871
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:04,917
That's absurd!

872
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:08,166
You did not think so
when it worked in your favor.

873
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,917
Do you want our world to suffer?

874
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:13,083
Oh no, I don't want that.

875
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,667
T'JON:
Without
the freighters

876
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:17,959
there will be no more shipments
of felicium.

877
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,458
We will die.

878
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:21,583
You must trust
yourselves.

879
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:24,667
There are...
other options.

880
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:32,125
Ensign, prepare
to beam our guests

881
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,959
and their cargo
down to Ornara.

882
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:51,000
Captain, I hope you realize
what you've done to us.

883
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,667
Of that, you can be sure.

884
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,166
Good luck.

885
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:21,041
Main bridge.
(<i> beeping</i> )

886
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,667
When the felicium
runs out

887
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:31,208
the people of Ornara
will suffer horrible
withdrawal pains.

888
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:35,375
No doubt,
but they will pass.

889
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,375
That seems so cruel.

890
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,000
We could have made
their burden easier.

891
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,709
Could have?

892
00:42:42,709 --> 00:42:47,000
Perhaps
in the short term

893
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,792
but to what end?

894
00:42:48,792 --> 00:42:50,959
Hold.
(<i> beeping</i> )

895
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:02,083
Beverly, the Prime Directive
is not just a set of rules.

896
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,625
It is a philosophy,
and a very correct one.

897
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,709
History has proved
again and again

898
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:12,458
that whenever mankind interferes

899
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:15,458
with a less-developed
civilization

900
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,000
no matter
how well
intentioned

901
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,291
that interference may be

902
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:24,000
the results
are invariably disastrous.

903
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,375
It's hard to be philosophical
when faced with suffering.

904
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:31,333
Believe me, Beverly, there was
only one decision.

905
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:34,583
I just hope
it was the right one.

906
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:37,500
And we may
never know.

907
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,458
Resume.
(<i> beeping</i> )

908
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,792
Mr. La Forge,
take us out of orbit.

909
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,166
Destination, sir?

910
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,917
I don't care.

911
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:56,583
Let's just get some distance
between us and this system.

912
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,291
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir.

913
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:01,250
Course nine-seven-zero
mark three-one-eight.

914
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,667
Speed, warp three.

915
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:05,792
Where will that take us,
Mr. La Forge?

916
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:07,250
The Opperline system.

917
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,959
An interesting choice.

918
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,625
Why?

919
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:15,458
Curiosity.

920
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:17,166
We've never been there.

921
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:26,792
Engage.
