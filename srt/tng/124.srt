00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:06,083
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41697.9.</i>

2
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:09,583
<i>We're en route to Sarona VIII</i>
<i>for much-needed shore leave.</i>

3
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:12,041
<i>The entire crew is looking</i>
<i>forward to the diversion.</i>

4
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,709
<i>On a personal note</i>

5
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:17,875
<i>I have allowed myself</i>
<i>the luxury of a head start.</i>

6
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,166
(<i> beeping</i> )

7
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,458
I took advantage.

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,959
No, no, Lieutenant.
The advantage was yours.

9
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,959
Come again.

10
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,875
En garde.

11
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,083
(<i> beeping</i> )

12
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,917
Interesting move, sir.

13
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,375
What technique
was that?

14
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,875
The technique
of a desperate man.

15
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,250
Interesting move,
sir.

16
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,875
What technique
was that?

17
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,792
The technique
of a desperate man.

18
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:30,917
Captain...

19
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:32,875
what was that?

20
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,208
Picard to Bridge.

21
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,792
RIKER:
Captain.

22
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,750
Number One,
did something unusual

23
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,208
just occur
on the Bridge?

24
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:48,834
Yes, sir. We experienced
some kind of loop

25
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:51,208
where everything
repeats itself.

26
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,208
Here, too.

27
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,208
I'm on my way.

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,792
Report, Mr. Data.

29
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,750
Sensors show nothing, sir

30
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,834
but it appears
a moment in time

31
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,583
repeated itself
exactly.

32
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,667
For everyone.

33
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,709
It was like a feeling
of<i> deja vu.</i>

34
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,625
Reports coming in
from all decks, sir.

35
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,959
Computers were
also affected, sir

36
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,083
which would indicate

37
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,875
the phenomenon was
not an illusion

38
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,208
but occurred
in real time.

39
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,750
Number One

40
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,125
find out if anything
similar happened
in this sector.

41
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:28,834
Sir, I am receiving
an emergency transmission

42
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:30,500
from the Pegos Minor System.

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,458
Put it on.

44
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,458
...542.2.

45
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:39,458
I repeat, this is
Dr. Paul Manheim.

46
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,208
We are in need of help.

47
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:46,500
Urgent. All ships,
please respond.

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,917
I repeat,

49
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:53,834
coordinates are 66728.9

50
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:57,667
by 7075...

51
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,417
It is an automated signal, sir.

52
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,500
I am unable
to establish contact.

53
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,834
This is Dr. Paul Manheim.

54
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,417
Shut it off.

55
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,959
Mr. La Forge, lay in a course
on those coordinates.

56
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,625
Aye, sir.

57
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,291
Captain, you act
as if there's a connection

58
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,333
between the time distortion

59
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,750
and the distress
signal.

60
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,125
There is.

61
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,208
Paul Manheim.

62
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,709
15 years ago, he went off
to work on experiments

63
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,792
relating to
non-linear time.

64
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,667
It appears he may
have achieved

65
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:28,709
some measure
of success.

66
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,750
Speed, warp 8.

67
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,083
Aye, sir.
Warp 8.

68
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,166
Engage.

69
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:59,000
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

72
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:09,208
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

73
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,709
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

74
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,917
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

75
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,083
Estimated arrival,
Pegos Minor--

76
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,250
four hours, 35 minutes,
17 seconds.

77
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,959
I've never heard
of Paul Manheim.

78
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,542
Mr. Data.

79
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,291
A highly respected scientist,
considered a visionary.

80
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,458
He advanced several
time-related theories.

81
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,125
One regarding the relationships
between time and gravity

82
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,875
was quite intriguing.

83
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,375
But neither that theory, nor any
other, received wide acceptance.

84
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,667
15 years ago, he assembled
a team of scientists

85
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,834
to expand that research.

86
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,959
They disappeared.

87
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,000
Haven't been heard from since.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Did you know him,
Captain?

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,917
I knew<i> of</i> him.

90
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:01,917
He was teaching at the
university when I was in Paris

91
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:05,000
but I, um...
didn't have the pleasure.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,917
I must change.

93
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:08,959
Number One, inform me
half an hour

94
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,917
before we reach
those coordinates

95
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:15,625
and keep trying to determine
if the time distortion

96
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,417
was specifically located
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

97
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:18,417
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,000
Captain.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Excuse me.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,875
Yes, what is it,
Counselor?

101
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,917
I think you would prefer
to discuss this in private.

102
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,083
No, that's not necessary.
Go on.

103
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,166
When Professor Manheim's
name was mentioned

104
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:35,125
you reacted with
intense emotion.

105
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,917
Yes. Please, get
to the point.

106
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:41,834
I don't want to interfere
with your personal life

107
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:45,458
but unresolved, strong emotion
can affect judgment.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,500
Well, thank you
for your concern.

109
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,834
As Ship's Counselor,
I offer my assistance.

110
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:56,542
What do you suggest?

111
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:02,375
Confronting deep personal
issues is not easy for you.

112
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,750
You tend to suppress them.

113
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,125
There are a few hours
until we arrive.

114
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:11,375
Perhaps you should use this
time to analyze your feelings

115
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,125
and put them
into perspective.

116
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,500
Thank you, Counselor.

117
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,875
If I should need you further,
I'll let you know.

118
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,792
Bridge.

119
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,792
Belay that.

120
00:07:55,792 --> 00:08:00,083
Computer, estimated arrival
at Pegos Minor?

121
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:04,083
COMPUTER:
Two hours, nine minutes.

122
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,083
Holodeck Three.

123
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,709
Computer,
this is Captain Picard.

124
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,709
Holodeck Three is clear.

125
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,583
Location: Paris.

126
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:26,667
Cafe des Artistes
as it appeared...

127
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:30,667
22 years ago.

128
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:33,625
April the 9th, 1500 hours...

129
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,667
3:00.

130
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:39,291
Warm spring day.

131
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,709
COMPUTER:
Program complete.

132
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,417
<i>Monsieur,</i> welcome
to the Cafe des Artistes.

133
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:01,000
Is this your first time
in Paris?

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,083
No.

135
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,500
This way.

136
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,875
That table.

137
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:11,917
<i>Oh, mais bien sur, Monsieur.</i>
We are here to please you.

138
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,750
I've been away
far too long.

139
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,917
Some wine?
Some cheese?

140
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,375
I'm not very hungry.

141
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,000
I really came
for the view.

142
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,083
Perhaps what you hunger
for is not on the menu.

143
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,333
Perhaps not.

144
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:49,583
It was many years ago.
I had a rendezvous.

145
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,000
I was to meet
someone...

146
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,083
someone here,
at that very table.

147
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,250
Your young lady,
she did not come?

148
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,667
Actually, I don't know.

149
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,375
I always imagined that she did.

150
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,750
You, however, did not.

151
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,375
Ah.

152
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,250
Well, trust Edouard.

153
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,208
I will bring something
very special, just for you.

154
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,667
Let's go, huh?
We've waited long enough.

155
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:35,000
Fran, you go.
I'll stay a little longer.

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,875
He's not coming,
Gabrielle.

157
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,166
No. After last night,
I know he will.

158
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,208
I just know it.

159
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,375
Then he would
be here.

160
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,959
You're making a fool
out of yourself

161
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,291
and I will
not watch.

162
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,333
Do we know each other?

163
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,291
No.

164
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,125
The way you look at me--
do I remind you of someone?

165
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,125
No.

166
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,208
Yes, you do somewhat.

167
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,542
He's not coming.

168
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:11,083
Why?

169
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,417
What did I do to drive him away?

170
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,875
Maybe you did nothing.

171
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,041
Maybe he had no choice.

172
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,125
Maybe he was afraid.

173
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,417
Of what? Of me?

174
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:29,333
Oh, of being connected.
Rooted.

175
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,750
Perhaps, if he's
as young as you are

176
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,875
he doesn't know yet exactly
what it is he wants to do.

177
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,083
Maybe...

178
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,458
Enough of this self-indulgence.

179
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,875
Exit.

180
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,709
Captain, we've
received communication

181
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:10,166
from the Freighter<i> Lalo</i>

182
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,333
as well as from a farming colony
on Coltar IV.

183
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,375
Both described the
same time distortion.

184
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,500
The Captain of the<i> Lalo</i>
described it as a hiccup.

185
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,875
Hiccup?

186
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,000
Actually, sir, that may
be an incorrect analogy.

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,166
How so, Data?

188
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,792
A hiccup
is a spasmodic inhalation

189
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,208
with closure of the glottis

190
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,166
accompanied by
a peculiar sound.

191
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,208
If we were to continue this
analogy to a body-function

192
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,583
what occurred would be
best represented by a...

193
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,417
Enough, Data.

194
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,125
Have you been able to learn
any more specifics

195
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,834
about the Manheim
project?

196
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,250
All I have found, sir,
is what you already know.

197
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,625
Manheim was concentrating

198
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,500
on time gravity experiments
when he left.

199
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,917
LA FORGE:
Captain.

200
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:45,542
We've reached the coordinates
specified.

201
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:46,875
There's nothing here.

202
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,750
I'm receiving
new coordinates.

203
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,125
It's a relay signal, same
source as the first one.

204
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,208
What are
they, Worf?

205
00:12:54,792 --> 00:13:00,166
664.8 by 1323.7 by 4949.9.

206
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,000
Very remote area, sir.

207
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,083
It's in the middle
of the Vandor System

208
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,458
a binary star system.

209
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,375
Main star is a B-class giant.

210
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,208
The companion star
is a pulsar.

211
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,333
Set course for the new
coordinates, Mr. La Forge.

212
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,583
Aye, sir.

213
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,250
Why is he making it this
difficult to find him?

214
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,500
Hopefully, he'll
tell us, Number One.

215
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:29,250
We have reached the
coordinates, Captain.

216
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,625
Sensors indicate
it is Vandor IV--

217
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,125
a planetoid
in elliptical orbit

218
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,500
around the
binary system.

219
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,333
Standard orbit, Mr. La Forge.

220
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,291
Aye, sir.

221
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,542
Give me a visual.

222
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,583
Viewscreen on.

223
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,792
WORF:
There's a small
force field on the planet.

224
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,709
Latitude 20 degrees,
nine minutes north.

225
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,208
Longitude 40 degrees,
two minutes east

226
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,542
of the present terminator.

227
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,208
Penetrable?

228
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,500
No, sir.

229
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,792
Open hailing frequencies.

230
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,458
Hailing frequencies
open, sir.

231
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,917
This is Captain...

232
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,417
This is the Captain
of the USS<i> Enterprise</i>

233
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,834
responding to your
call for help.

234
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:07,000
WOMAN:
<i>Enterprise.</i>
Thank you for hearing us.

235
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,542
Where are you?

236
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:11,041
We're in orbit
around Vandor, now.

237
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:14,083
Then you can help me.
I-I don't know what to do.

238
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:18,250
It's only the two of us left.
He's having convulsions.

239
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,458
Please.

240
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,667
Can you lock on
to her coordinates?

241
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,959
No, sir. The force field is
preventing any kind of contact

242
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,542
other than audio.

243
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,625
There is a force field
at your location.

244
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,333
Yes, I know.

245
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,667
Good.

246
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,875
But it is preventing us
from helping you.

247
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,917
Now, you must try to find
some way to shut it down.

248
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,291
I'll try.

249
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,792
Force field is off.

250
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,000
Good.
Lock on to their coordinates.

251
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,458
Beam them up
directly to Sick Bay.

252
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,625
Dr. Crusher, prepare
for a medical emergency.

253
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,333
Two to beam directly
up to Sick Bay.

254
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,834
CRUSHER:
We'll be ready, Captain.

255
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,083
That's where I'll be.

256
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,125
Number One.
Mr. Data.

257
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:19,917
I'll help.

258
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,333
Easy. Easy.

259
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,875
I've got his legs.

260
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,500
How long has he been like this?

261
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,667
Several hours,
at least.

262
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,709
He was in his lab,
so I can't be sure.

263
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:37,667
I need to do some tests.

264
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,750
I... uh...

265
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,417
Jean-Luc.

266
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:58,208
I thought the voice
sounded familiar.

267
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,750
Hello.

268
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:06,583
I should have known.

269
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,500
Who else would have
charged to my rescue?

270
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,583
This is my First Officer,
Commander William Riker.

271
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,917
Lieutenant Commander Data.

272
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:26,542
This is Jenice...
Manheim.

273
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,166
A pleasure, Mrs. Manheim.

274
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,250
Thank you.

275
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,333
I have a number
of questions for you.

276
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,667
I hope I can be
of some help.

277
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,500
Why don't we sit down in here?

278
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,834
You said that there were
only two of you left.

279
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,125
What happened
to the rest of the crew?

280
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,417
They were working
at the second lab.

281
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:48,583
Something happened there
a few weeks ago.

282
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,667
They were all killed.

283
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:52,875
It was a terrible accident.

284
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't know
exactly what happened.

285
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,709
So many brilliant,
wonderful minds...

286
00:16:57,709 --> 00:16:59,834
just gone.

287
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:03,458
Do you know the nature
of Dr. Manheim's work?

288
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,542
Paul's always been
interested in time.

289
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:07,875
He's never believed
that it was immutable

290
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,875
any more than space
is immutable.

291
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,083
Over the last decade,
he came to believe

292
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,250
that we reside in one
of infinite dimensions

293
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,542
and what holds
us here

294
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:19,291
is the constancy
of time.

295
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,709
Change that and it would be
what he called

296
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,709
opening the window
to those other dimensions.

297
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,542
Which begins
to explain what happened.

298
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,959
Have you been experiencing

299
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:30,959
something up here?

300
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,208
Yes, what is emanating here

301
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,291
is having repercussions
light years away

302
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,875
maybe even further.

303
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,625
That would explain his anxiety.

304
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,917
I had no idea it had gone
so far beyond Vandor.

305
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,959
Why this place?
Why Vandor?

306
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,250
All I can tell you about that

307
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,250
is that Paul
and the rest of the team

308
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,041
searched for two years
to find it.

309
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,625
Vandor is exactly
what they needed--

310
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,709
a planetoid
around a binary star.

311
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:57,250
Because of the dense
gravity of the pulsar.

312
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,625
Did your husband ever attempt
to define these dimensions

313
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,834
to give you an idea

314
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,166
of what
he expected?

315
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,834
No, but he did say
that he was very close

316
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,291
to proving his theories.

317
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,000
And then the accident...

318
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,750
Did he anticipate that these
experiments might be dangerous?

319
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,792
I didn't think so

320
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:21,291
but, now in retrospect,
he probably did.

321
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,333
That would explain
the unusual precautions

322
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,250
he began taking
even before the accident--

323
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,667
the force field

324
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,750
the elaborate
security system.

325
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,208
And every time he started
a new experiment

326
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,000
he insisted that I stay
in what he called

327
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,083
a protected room.

328
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,959
Aha, and that's why you
weren't affected.

329
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:44,500
Jean-Luc, he would never
knowingly do anything

330
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,583
to hurt anyone.

331
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,583
Yes, I believe that.

332
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,375
But as he saw his goal
getting closer--

333
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,709
seeming possible--

334
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,750
he became more
and more obsessive.

335
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,750
Maybe that clouded
his judgment.

336
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,959
This is not how I imagined
seeing you again.

337
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:08,125
Nor I you.

338
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,959
You've
done well.

339
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,792
A great starship

340
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,000
on the far reaches
of the galaxy.

341
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,333
It's everything you'd hoped.

342
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,625
(<i> chuckling</i> )

343
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,792
Not exactly.

344
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:22,792
Nothing works
just as you hope.

345
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,709
If you can't tell us
any more

346
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:27,458
I need to send
a team down to the lab.

347
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,375
You can't--
it's protected.

348
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,458
One of the young
scientists

349
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,750
made sure no one
could get in.

350
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,125
CRUSHER:
Uh, excuse me.

351
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,875
Is he worse?

352
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,875
He's resting.

353
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,875
But I'd like you

354
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,500
to undergo
some tests yourself.

355
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,709
My nurse will
start them.

356
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:46,792
Thank you
for your kindness, Doctor.

357
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,291
She's an old friend.

358
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,834
I gathered that.

359
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,875
It's her husband I'm more
concerned with at the moment.

360
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,291
What's the prognosis?

361
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,166
I believe
he's dying.

362
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,750
His neurochemistry
has been affected

363
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,083
but I don't know how or why.

364
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,792
I've never encountered
anything like it before.

365
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,000
How long does he have?

366
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,417
Maybe a couple
of days.

367
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,458
It's hard to predict.

368
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,041
All I can do
is maintain him--

369
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,333
or attempt
to maintain him--

370
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,792
until I find out
what's causing the damage.

371
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,000
Can we talk
to him?

372
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Not now,
not yet.

373
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,417
Incidentally, Captain

374
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,208
the effects
of the time distortions

375
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,542
are now being felt
in the Ilecom System.

376
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,208
Bridge.

377
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,333
(<i> beeping</i> )

378
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,917
In the past decade

379
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,750
Manheim has turned
some vague theories

380
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,417
into a practical
application.

381
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:41,875
Yes, but without his help

382
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,208
I'm not sure we'll be able

383
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,458
to pose any
intelligent questions

384
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,667
let alone come up
with any solutions.

385
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:48,834
Incidentally, Captain

386
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,750
the effects
of the time distortions

387
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,125
are now being felt
in the Ilecom System.

388
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,125
It's us, before we stepped
into the turbolift.

389
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,083
It's happening again.

390
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,667
I feel no disorientation.

391
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:01,959
Nor do I.

392
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,583
What was that?

393
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,250
I believe what
could be termed as

394
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,291
the Manheim effect

395
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,625
is becoming
more pronounced.

396
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,250
This is where
we started.

397
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,500
If we are us.

398
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,750
Oh, we are us, sir

399
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,500
but they
are also us

400
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,250
so, indeed,
we are both us...

401
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,041
at different points
along the same time continuum.

402
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,917
Bridge.

403
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,208
(<i> beeping</i> )

404
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,583
What have
you learned?

405
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,083
We have completed a scan
of the planet's surface, sir.

406
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,291
We've discovered
the second lab.

407
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,417
It's on the far side
of the planet--

408
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:48,542
completely destroyed.

409
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:51,291
Unable to determine
what caused it.

410
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,542
Otherwise, very little
to clarify this situation.

411
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,625
Our sensors show
an immense volume of energy

412
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,291
emanating deep
within the planet

413
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,583
and concentrated near
Manheim's remaining laboratory.

414
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,709
How is the energy being used?

415
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:02,000
No idea.

416
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,041
What's its
source?

417
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,542
I cannot be sure, sir

418
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,166
but I believe Manheim
has developed a method

419
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,083
for harnessing energy
from the pulsar.

420
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,875
RIKER:
It comes down
to this, Captain--

421
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,375
we've learned everything
we can from here

422
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,291
and we are no closer
to understanding it

423
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,959
than we were 12 hours ago.

424
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,583
Manheim is unable to help us

425
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,792
but, hopefully, having been a
good scientist, he kept notes.

426
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,667
I would need to study
Manheim's records, sir.

427
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:22,834
In order to do that

428
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,417
we're going to have
to go down there.

429
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,458
What about the defense system
Mrs. Manheim spoke of?

430
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,291
It may have been connected
to the main system

431
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,750
and when she lowered
the shields

432
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,250
she may have turned
that off, as well.

433
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,917
If not, we'll deal with it
as best we can.

434
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,000
Prepare your team.

435
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,125
Aye, sir.

436
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,667
Coordinates set?

437
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,750
Yes, sir.

438
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,375
Energize.

439
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,500
There's a lack of integrity
at the landing point.

440
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
I'm losing them.

441
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,542
Bring them back-- now!

442
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,959
Chief Herbert,
what's going on?

443
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:21,792
There seems to be some kind
of strange bouncing effect.

444
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:24,625
I can't get them to materialize.

445
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,000
My readings aren't complete.

446
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,500
Keep trying.

447
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,125
What are we
doing back here?

448
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,834
You're lucky you made it back
at all, sir.

449
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,500
Where am I?

450
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,750
Paul?

451
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,208
Thank God.

452
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,750
You're on the
USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

453
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,125
They answered
your distress signal.

454
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,750
I sent one?

455
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,458
Oh Paul, you're going to be
just fine.

456
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:15,166
No, I am not fine, Jenice.

457
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,875
I'm not even close to fine.

458
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,458
Bridge, this is Dr. Crusher.

459
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,583
Professor Manheim is conscious.

460
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,917
MANHEIM:
Remember, it was worth it.

461
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:23,834
What happened, what
will happen, all of it.

462
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:26,500
It was all worth it.

463
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,166
Again.

464
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,417
It's changing again.

465
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,500
What is?

466
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,917
What do you see?

467
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,583
I am having difficulty.

468
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,375
With what?
Are you in pain?

469
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,917
I have been on the other side.

470
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:40,834
I have touched
another dimension.

471
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:43,959
Part of me
is still there.

472
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,542
Help him.

473
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:47,583
Try to stay calm, Dr. Manheim.

474
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,917
I don't think it's going to help
you, struggling against it.

475
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:53,000
My mind is floating
between two places.

476
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,250
It is difficult to know
which is which.

477
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,834
There is no way
to explain it.

478
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,875
Dr. Manheim,
I'm Captain Picard.

479
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:07,000
The same one?

480
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,625
She has told me about you.

481
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,166
Not all, but enough.

482
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,500
We need your help.

483
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,375
The situation is not good.

484
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,959
It will get worse.

485
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:22,041
What do we do?
How do we stop it?

486
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:25,709
I am having difficulty
holding the moment.

487
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:28,208
Doctor, this is Lieutenant
Commander Data.

488
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:31,250
Will you explain
the situation to him?

489
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,291
I am fully versed, sir,
on all your theories

490
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,625
regarding time and gravity.

491
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,375
How is that possible?

492
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:40,458
I am not even fully versed
on all my theories.

493
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:41,959
I am an android.

494
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:46,458
Android?
On a Starfleet vessel?

495
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,041
I am the only one, sir.

496
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:50,583
Your knowledge
is useless

497
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,000
because the work
we have done here

498
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,166
has made most
of those theories obsolete.

499
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:57,458
Then you have harnessed
a dynamic energy source.

500
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,792
Then you do
understand, yes.

501
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,166
We were able to locate
an energy source

502
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:04,208
in the center of this planetoid.

503
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:08,166
We learned to enhance it,
to focus it.

504
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,750
Everything worked too well.

505
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,250
The energy from the pulsar.

506
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,500
The energy from the planetoid.

507
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,792
We opened a crack...

508
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:21,083
a window into another dimension.

509
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,000
The time distortion we felt.

510
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,834
Felt?

511
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,417
Then it is not confined
to the planetoid?

512
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:28,583
The range is at least

513
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:31,125
several thousand
light years.

514
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,125
Captain, it must be stopped.

515
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,041
You must help me to execute

516
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:38,041
a controlled shut-down
of this experiment.

517
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,041
Get my notes.

518
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,333
They are in the lab.

519
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,792
How do we bypass
the security system?

520
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,458
I'll give you
the correct coordinates

521
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,250
to beam safely down to Vandor

522
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,875
and the codes you need
to bypass security systems

523
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,875
to get into my lab.

524
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,834
(<i> gasps</i> )

525
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:03,792
If what the professor
has given me is accurate

526
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:06,041
it is possible
to repair the damage

527
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,083
but it must be perfectly
timed to coincide

528
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,792
with another time
distortion episode.

529
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:12,166
Can we predict the timing?

530
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,166
I believe so, sir.

531
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,875
We have to.

532
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,583
If we don't seal that hole,
this other dimension he's opened

533
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,500
will rip into the fabric
of the galaxy.

534
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,458
Reality as we perceive it
will not be the same.

535
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,583
Lieutenant Worf.
Yes, sir?

536
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:26,041
I want those codes that
Manheim gave Mr. Data rechecked

537
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,750
and then checked again.

538
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,333
No one is beaming down to Vandor
unless we can be reasonably sure

539
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,458
they can get through.

540
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,375
Aye, sir.

541
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,625
I'm sorry for intruding.

542
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,709
I was told
I'd find you here.

543
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:39,166
You're not intruding.

544
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,792
We're just finished.
Come in.

545
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,834
Thank you.

546
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,709
I knew you wouldn't come to me.

547
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:57,166
No, not
under these circumstances.

548
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,625
We have unfinished business.

549
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:05,834
Yes, we do.

550
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:08,375
Why didn't you come to meet me
that last day in Paris?

551
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:13,291
I was afraid.

552
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,625
I didn't want this.

553
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,583
What?

554
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,834
The truth.

555
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:18,625
Oh, you want me to lie?

556
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,959
Of course.

557
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:24,834
A nice, soft, painless lie.

558
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:26,333
Oh, I got the days confused.

559
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,542
I thought it was Tuesday
when it was Wednesday.

560
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:29,750
I went to the Cafe Moulin

561
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,792
instead
of the Cafe des Artistes.

562
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,917
Ah, that's better.

563
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:36,667
It was raining
and you couldn't find a cab.

564
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,500
Mm-hmm.

565
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:44,834
I waited all day.

566
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:47,041
And it was raining.

567
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,458
It rained the rest of the week.

568
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,583
I went to Starfleet
Headquarters

569
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:51,709
looking for you

570
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:54,834
but you'd already
shipped out.

571
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:59,250
So, come on, Jean-Luc.

572
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,875
Let's hear the truth.

573
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:08,583
It was fear.

574
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:11,083
Fear of seeing you,
losing my resolve.

575
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,667
Fear of staying.

576
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:17,417
Losing myself.

577
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:19,750
Fear that neither
of these choices was right

578
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,458
and that either would have...

579
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:29,834
For a long time,
not a day went by

580
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:33,125
that I didn't look up
into the sky

581
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,959
and wonder.

582
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,667
Each time that I
returned to Earth

583
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:45,125
my thoughts were
filled with you.

584
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:49,500
I've thought a lot about this
over the years.

585
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,625
And perhaps you're leaving out
your greatest fear.

586
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:56,750
The real reason
you left.

587
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,041
Which was?

588
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:00,667
That life
with me

589
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:04,625
would have somehow made you
ordinary.

590
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:17,166
(<i> chuckling</i> )

591
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,500
You're wonderful.

592
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,959
And am I that transparent?

593
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,709
Only to me.

594
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:55,875
I wish I could talk to you,
Professor Manheim.

595
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,667
I bet you were really something.

596
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:02,834
(<i> moaning</i> )

597
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,750
Deanna.

598
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,959
I wanted to see
how he was doing.

599
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:16,083
The same.

600
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,709
Nothing I do seems
to make any difference.

601
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:25,709
That's not why you're here.

602
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:30,834
I thought I was
the empath.

603
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:37,542
Are you all right?

604
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,125
Why wouldn't I be?

605
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:41,291
I've got one of the medical
wonders of the galaxy

606
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,750
dying in my Sick Bay.

607
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,166
That's not what
I meant.

608
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,709
I don't think
I want to talk

609
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,917
about what I think
you mean.

610
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:51,250
Captain Picard...

611
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,083
I can't compete with a ghost
from his past.

612
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,291
No one could.

613
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,917
She's not a ghost.

614
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,500
She's here right now.

615
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
She may be in the here and now

616
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,500
but it's the ghost he sees.

617
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,583
Excuse me.

618
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:08,917
I have to get back
to my patient.

619
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,875
How soon, Mr. Data?

620
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,667
If Dr. Manheim's
information is correct

621
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:18,792
by my calculations

622
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:21,417
the next time distortion
should occur

623
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:23,000
between 28
to 47 minutes.

624
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,041
CRUSHER:
Bridge, this is Sick Bay.

625
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:28,250
Dr. Manheim is awake and asking
to speak to you, Captain.

626
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,667
Alone.

627
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,375
On my way, Doctor.

628
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,959
You asked for me.

629
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,625
I am not sure

630
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:47,542
that I remembered all of the
codes for the security system.

631
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:49,500
You should warn
anyone going down there.

632
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,208
Thank you.
I'll tell them to be cautious.

633
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:58,000
What I really wanted to talk
to you about is Jenice.

634
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,625
Dr. Manheim, I did not come here
to discuss your wife.

635
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,375
It is only this.

636
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:07,041
If anything
should go wrong

637
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:11,250
please take care of her for me.

638
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:21,208
Of course.

639
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:28,250
She never would admit this

640
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,542
but she has had a terrible time
these last years.

641
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,208
Had we not been
so isolated

642
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,542
she might have
left me

643
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:36,125
and I never would have known.

644
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,458
At least, not right away.

645
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,792
Perhaps I am
not a man

646
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:44,792
who should have
a woman like her.

647
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:46,750
She deserves better.

648
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:52,500
You underestimate her.

649
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,083
I know, because
I once did.

650
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,500
In both cases,
the time distortions occurred

651
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,583
along the same continuum

652
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:11,083
as a preview or a reprise
of a specific point in time.

653
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,917
Where we are,
where we were

654
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,583
and where we will be.

655
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:19,291
Data, I want this to be
an away team of one-- you.

656
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,291
I don't think there's any reason
to risk anyone else.

657
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,041
It is reasonable, sir.

658
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:27,583
After all, I
am a machine,
and dispensable.

659
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:30,417
"Indispensable" is
the appropriate word.

660
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:32,250
I think it should be
only you

661
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,417
because you seem
more able to control

662
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,583
the effects
of the time distortion.

663
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:39,875
Oh, I see, sir.
That is quite true, sir.

664
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:41,208
I see time
as a constant

665
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:43,583
whereas humans perceive
time as flexible.

666
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,166
Hence the expression

667
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,792
"time flies when
you're having fun"

668
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:50,125
which, until now, has
always confused me.

669
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:54,709
Well, I want you
to put a stitch in time

670
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:57,375
and save
much more than nine.

671
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,417
Sir?

672
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:00,667
If other members
of the away team

673
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:02,959
became disoriented

674
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:05,750
it could create
additional problems

675
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,583
and perhaps increase the danger.

676
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,792
I will go immediately, sir.

677
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,041
Good luck, Data.

678
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,125
All right.

679
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:21,500
We have the coordinates exactly
as the professor specified.

I am proceeding to the lab, sir.

683
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,834
Maintain an open frequency,
Mr. Data.

684
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:51,250
Aye, sir.

Mr. Data, what's going on?

688
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,041
Dr. Manheim forgot to mention

689
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:22,083
one of his security
precautions, sir.

690
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:24,583
I am proceeding
into the laboratory.

691

(<i> chiming roar</i> )

692
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,959
PICARD:
Mr. Data, this channel
will remain open.

693
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,750
Please continue to report.

694
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:06,542
This appears to be
the instrument

695
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:08,583
Dr. Manheim described.

696
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:11,709
It should confirm when the
next time effect will occur.

697
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,000
Data, did Manheim give
you enough information

698
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,583
to decipher
the security code?

699
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:18,208
I will know in a moment, sir.

700
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,542
According to calculations

701
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:24,750
the next time effect will occur
in one minute, 30 seconds.

702
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,208
What's the next
step, Mr. Data?

703
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:31,750
I will need to add a specific
amount of antimatter

704
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,750
to rebalance
and align the system.

705
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,792
PICARD:
Will that plug the hole?

706
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:37,792
Theoretically, yes.

707
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:40,875
In reality, I do not know.

708
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,125
When the effect hits

709
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,208
the force fields will align

710
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:57,542
opening a clean, straight path
to the other dimension.

711
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,500
Whatever the time distortion

712
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,417
I must add the antimatter
at the appropriate moment.

713
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:05,375
Geordi, if the professor
was right

714
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:07,208
I will need
a 27-second countdown.

715
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,208
You've got it, Data.

716
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:13,542
Captain, I now have
the antimatter

717
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,834
and am moving towards
the opening

718
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:17,750
at the end of the lab.

719
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,792
The next time distortion
should occur within seconds.

720
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:27,625
Geordi, begin countdown
on my mark.

721
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,333
<i>Now.</i>

722
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,750
LA FORGE:
27, 26, 25...

723
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:41,000
(<i> echoing</i> ):
24-4, 23-3, 22-2, 21-1, 20...

724
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,250
Captain

725
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,417
there appear
to be three of us.

726
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,750
Should I drop
the antimatter

727
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,083
or wait for one of you?

728
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,250
Only one of us

729
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,333
is in the correct
time continuum.

730
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,667
Which one?

731
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,417
Me.

732
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,500
It's me.

733
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,250
LA FORGE:
Fi-fi-five, fo-fo-four,
thr-thr-three

734
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,583
tw-tw-two, one-one-one.
Now-now-now.

735
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,041
PICARD:
Data, report.

736
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,375
Are you all right?

737
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,333
Yes, sir.

738
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:10,667
PICARD:
Is it closed?

739
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:14,250
It is well-patched, sir.

740
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,000
Closed indicates
a permanent condition

741
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,875
which I cannot guarantee.

742
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,959
Patched is good enough.

743
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:22,041
Well done.

744
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,834
Beam back immediately.

745
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:27,583
With pleasure, sir.

746
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:33,166
This is amazing.

747
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:38,458
All your readings are
completely normal.

748
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,083
Where is my wife?
Is she all right?

749
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,000
She's right here.

750
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,041
Jenice.

751
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,250
Paul.

752
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,333
The effect has
been reversed.

753
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,792
I can feel it.

754
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:49,709
We're safe.

755
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:50,875
How is he?

756
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,000
He needs rest.

757
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,500
There might be some
residual effects

758
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,625
but other than that,
he'll be all right.

759
00:39:56,625 --> 00:40:00,208
I feel like I am coming
out of a long tunnel.

760
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,500
It's there.

761
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,041
Not at all like I thought
it would be--

762
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,000
different.

763
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,333
Describe it.

764
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:10,792
I can't. Not yet.

765
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:12,834
The only words that fit
are too pale

766
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:16,792
because the images
are so vibrant.

767
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:20,166
It's not like anything, anyone
has ever experienced before.

768
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,458
There was....

769
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:25,291
no, no, there<i> is</i>
this kind of life--

770
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:30,583
not like us, not like this...

771
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:33,583
What's the condition
of my lab?

772
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:37,250
Intact, for the most part.

773
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,875
Don't tell me
we're going back.

774
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,542
Oh, Jenice, we are
so close.

775
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:45,041
We have learned so much
to walk away.

776
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,208
Besides, we owe it
to the others, our friends.

777
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:50,667
There have been
so many sacrifices

778
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:55,291
by so many good people.

779
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:58,542
We'll be going back.

780
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:02,083
Mm-hmm, yes, I can see that.

781
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,583
I'm sure the Federation
will want to help

782
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,458
in any way that it can.

783
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:09,625
Thank you.

784
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:12,667
This time,
it will be different.

785
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:13,792
I promise.

786
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:15,458
(<i> laughing</i> )

787
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:18,667
It always is,
my love.

788
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:22,041
You said my life
would never be dull

789
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:24,333
and it never has been.

790
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,583
Thank you.

791
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,709
Computer, this is
Counselor Troi.

792
00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:41,041
Request access.

793
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,125
Do you wish to terminate
the current program?

794
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,709
No, continue the program.

795
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:47,709
Enter when ready.

796
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:49,875
The Captain is waiting
for you inside.

797
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:57,917
How is this possible?

798
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:01,208
It's Paris.

799
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,792
Unbelievable.

800
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:07,291
Madame, this way.

801
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,542
The Captain is
waiting for you.

802
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:13,834
This is so real.

803
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:16,583
<i>Bien sur. Pourquoi pas?</i>

804
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:22,333
Jean-Luc, don't tell me
how you did it.

805
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:25,083
I don't care.

806
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:27,166
It's perfect.

807
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,250
It's as if we
were really there.

808
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:37,000
I wanted to say good-bye
properly this time.

809
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,542
(<i> champagne fizzing</i> )

810
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:47,166
I shall always
picture you here.

811
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,083
(<i> glasses clink</i> )

812
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:57,417
I expect you to always come
charging to my rescue.

813
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:59,792
I'll do my best.

814
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:04,542
Good-bye, Jean-Luc.

815
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:07,000
Be well.

816
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:09,917
And you.

817
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:12,125
Thank you for Paris.

818
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,542
Well, so much for my
dramatically romantic exit.

819
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,500
Is anything
wrong?

820
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,625
No, sir.

821
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:56,417
Then set course
for Sarona VIII.

822
00:43:56,417 --> 00:43:59,000
As I remember

823
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,875
we were on our way for some
much-needed shore leave.

824
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:04,375
Course plotted
and laid in, sir.

825
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,792
Warp five.

826
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:09,333
Engage.

827
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:11,834
I've only been there once, but
they've got this great club.

828
00:44:11,834 --> 00:44:13,208
I don't remember
the name of it--

829
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,792
they serve those
blue concoctions.

830
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:16,125
It's across the square

831
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:18,125
from the Zanza Men's
Dance Palace.

832
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:22,750
It's called
the Blue Parrot Cafe.

833
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,625
And you're buying.
