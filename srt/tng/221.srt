00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:04,458
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42923.4.</i>

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,959
<i>Despite misgivings</i>

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,667
<i>I have agreed</i>
<i>to Starfleet's request</i>

4
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:10,417
<i>that the</i> Enterprise<i> divert</i>
<i>to the Braslota system</i>

5
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:12,792
<i>to take part in</i>
<i>a war game exercise.</i>

6
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:15,917
<i>Joining us</i>
<i>as observer and mediator</i>

7
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:20,041
<i>is the Zakdorn master</i>
<i>strategist, Sirna Kolrami.</i>

8
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,709
Mr. Kolrami.

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,875
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
Welcome aboard.

10
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:38,583
Captain, I bring you greetings
from those at Starfleet Command.

11
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,959
Would you care to be
shown to your quarters?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,583
I require little
rest, Captain.

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,041
I prefer that we commence
with our mission.

14
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:56,291
Despite their reputations,
<i>this</i> Zakdorn

15
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,917
does not appear to be
a very formidable warrior.

16
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,709
In the game of
military brinksmanship

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,875
individual physical prowess
is less important

18
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:08,333
than the perception
of a species as a whole.

19
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,583
For over nine millennia

20
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:12,041
potential foes have
regarded the Zakdorns

21
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:15,917
as having the greatest innately
strategic minds in the galaxy.

22
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,792
So no one is willing to test
that perception in combat.

23
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:21,917
Exactly.

24
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,792
Then the reputation
means nothing.

25
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,041
The Braslota system.

26
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,709
In orbit around
the second planet

27
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,959
is the 80-year-old
Starcruiser<i> Hathaway.</i>

28
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,417
He is still your first choice?

29
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,333
Commander Riker will
captain the<i> Hathaway.</i>

30
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,792
You will have 48 hours
to ready your vessel

31
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:47,625
before the<i> Enterprise</i>
attacks.

32
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:48,959
And we'll experience
actual battle conditions?

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,542
Correct.

34
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,625
Engineering will disconnect
the<i> Enterprise's</i> weapons

35
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:57,166
and link the system with
a modified laser pulse beam.

36
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,542
All hits will
be recorded
electronically.

37
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,750
If the computer
registers damage,

38
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:03,875
it will act accordingly

39
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,750
shutting down
the affected areas

40
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,166
for the appropriate
repair time.

41
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,333
Additional questions?

42
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,834
Captain Picard,
it is my understanding

43
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,250
that you initially resisted

44
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,500
Starfleet's request
for this simulation.

45
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,834
Yes.

46
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,166
May I know why?

47
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,208
Starfleet is not
a military organization.

48
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,875
Its purpose is exploration.

49
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,625
Then why am I here?

50
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:37,125
With the Borg threat

51
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,250
I decided that my officers
and I needed...

52
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,291
to hone our
tactical skills.

53
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,625
In a crisis situation

54
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,583
it is prudent to have
several options.

55
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,208
Ah.

56
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,417
RIKER:
I prefer brains
over brawn, as well.

57
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,333
I think it's a waste of effort
to test our combat skills.

58
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,166
It's a minor province in the
makeup of a starship captain.

59
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,625
Your objection is noted.

60
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,750
Let us hope that your

61
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:03,750
distaste for the exercise
will not affect

62
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:07,291
your strategic abilities.

63
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,834
Mr. Kolrami, when I agree
to do something,

64
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,166
I do it.

65
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,417
Would you care
to surrender now, Captain?

66
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,333
PICARD:

Well, Number One, you are

who will serve

78
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,542
during your absence.

79
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,959
I had envisioned you
defining the crew.

80
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,583
On my ship,
the leader of an away team

81
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,458
has total control
of the mission.

82
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,041
If you want to judge leadership,
why not start at the beginning?

83
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,041
Very well

84
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,250
Captain.

85
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,625
Hmm.

86
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,125
Oh, my.

87
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,834
What a charmer.

88
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,125
Doctor.

89
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,291
Captain, he needs
an attitude adjustment.

90
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,000
The Zakdornian culture
is replete

91
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,250
with self-assuredness
and confidence.

92
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,041
Seldom is it undeserved.

93
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,125
For example, Kolrami is
a third-level grand master

94
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,792
at the game of Strategema.

95
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,709
Another millimeter.

96
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,291
That's it.
A little more.

97
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,583
There.

98
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,959
That's excellent.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,083
RIKER:
Lieutenant.

100
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,709
Yes, Commander.

101
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,458
You've heard about the
simulation aboard the<i> Hathaway?</i>

102
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,166
Oh, yes, sir, and the
best of luck to you.

103
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,834
I've researched those
old Avidyne engines.

104
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,083
They're archaic by our
standards, very touchy.

105
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,625
Anticipating the worst

106
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,375
do you think they can be whipped
into shape in 48 hours?

107
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,125
I've already
taken the liberty

108
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,000
of putting together
a few necessities.

109
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,959
(<i> door chime</i> )

110
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,959
Enter!

111
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,041
Am I disturbing you?

112
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,959
Just finished.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,500
You know of the simulation,
what do you think?

114
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,667
Waste of time.

115
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,792
It's just designed
to be an exercise.

116
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,458
Useless.

117
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,417
If there is nothing
to lose, no sacrifice

118
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,583
then there is nothing to gain.

119
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,917
You mean besides pride.

120
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,792
Well, in this case,
it doesn't matter.

121
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:18,834
I probably haven't
got a chance.

122
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,291
There is always a chance.

123
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,834
Slim.

124
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,583
The<i> Hathaway's</i> most
sophisticated weapons system--

125
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,125
even in a computer mock-up--

126
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,959
can't hope to defeat
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,625
Well, still...

128
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,917
You're outmanned, you're
outgunned, you're out-equipped.

129
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,625
What else have you got?

130
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,917
Guile.

131
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,625
Join me.

132
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,333
The honor is to serve.

133
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,375
PICARD:
Begin long-range scanning
of all sectors

134
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:00,333
within three light-years
of Braslota.

135
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,375
How's your crew shaping up?

136
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:02,458
It's complete,
but I would like

137
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,917
to request an addition.

138
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,041
Anyone in particular?

139
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,458
With your permission
I would like

140
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,875
acting Ensign Crusher on board

141
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,083
for educational
observation.

142
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:17,208
Thank you, Captain.

143
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,041
It appears we'll
have some time

144
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,750
before reaching Braslota.

145
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:23,917
I was wondering
if you'd agree

146
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,333
to play me
in a game of Strategema.

147
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,792
Although I'm intrigued
by the audacity of your request

148
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:34,709
I can't fathom why<i> you</i> would
wish the encounter.

149
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,709
I enjoy a challenge.

150
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,917
Very well.

151
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,583
An opponent of limited
dimensions

152
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,000
can often be quite diverting.

153
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,250
Thank you.

154
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,875
So you're going to beat him,
huh?

155
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,083
No.

156
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,291
Well, then it's going
to be a close one?

157
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,667
Nope.

158
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:00,875
But you have got a chance?

159
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,083
Nah.

160
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,625
Are you even going
to bother to show up?

161
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,959
Sure, Kolrami
is the best ever
at Strategema.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,500
Just to get to play
him is a privilege.

163
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:09,000
So, aside from
your being privileged

164
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,792
is there anything else
I can look forward to?

165
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:11,792
Nope.

166
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:14,667
This is going
to be exciting.

167
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,959
Against an opponent
of approximate skill

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,417
Strategema can last
well over 1,000 moves.

169
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,458
I wouldn't bet on us
being here that long.

170
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,583
I have wagered heavily
in the ship's pool

171
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,917
that you will take him
past the sixth plateau.

172
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,959
And if I don't?

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,083
I will be... irritated.

174
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,083
Forever curious,
this urge to compete.

175
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,667
It's a human response.

176
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,458
That inborn craving

177
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,709
to gauge your capabilities
through conflict.

178
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,375
Doctor, there are other ways
to challenge oneself.

179
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:05,333
Well, perhaps, but they all lack
a certain thrill.

180
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,917
Data, humans sometimes
find it helpful

181
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,750
to have an outsider
set the standard

182
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:10,875
by which
they're judged.

183
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,834
To avoid deceiving oneself.

184
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,000
Maybe you should challenge

185
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,542
Kolrami to Strategema.

186
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,959
Why, Doctor?

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,041
Because, when
someone is that smug

188
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,959
you occasionally
have to deflate
them, just a little.

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,333
Yeah, Data.

190
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,917
I'd like to see
your neural flecks

191
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,709
tear him down a peg.

192
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,041
To what end?

193
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,041
WORF:
Computer...

194
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,667

for Strategema.

195
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:37,667
Ready?

196
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:39,041
Begin.

197
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:41,542
LA FORGE:
Come on, Commander.

198
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,542
Come on now.

199
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,542
You can do it.

200
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,917
You can get him.

201
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,208
Come on, Commander,
come on.

202
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,083
You got him, you got him.
Watch him now.

203
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,291
(<i> observers encouraging</i>
<i>and commenting</i> )

204
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,875
(<i> computer beeps</i> )

205
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,500
Hmm.

206
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,375
That's it?

207
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:02,834
I'm afraid so.

208
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,333
But you only
made 23 moves.

209
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,333
Yes.

210
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,750
Congratulations.

211
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,291
Hmm, hmm-hmm.

212
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,166
Commander Riker,

213
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,333
there's your
next challenge.

214
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:30,166
WORF:
Away team assembled and ready
to transport, Commander.

215
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,291
I may get over there
and want to come right home.

216
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,333
Good luck, Number One...

217
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,125
Captain.

218
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,333
The simulation will
commence in 48 hours.

219
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:05,417
LA FORGE:
There should be some
emergency bridge lighting here.

220
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,208
(<i> beeping</i> )

221
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,166
(<i> whirring</i> )

222
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,625
Not good.

223
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:17,667
Ah, you're
wrong, Mr. Worf.

224
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,208
It's fantastic.

225
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,166
And it's ours.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,458
Mr. Worf.

227
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,709
Sir...

228
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,458
Lieutenant La Forge
is a superior officer.

229
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,667
The honor
should be his.

230
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,083
Worf, this is
a battle simulation.

231
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,917
You're my tactical officer.

232
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,959
Discussed this with Geordi,
and we agreed.

233
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,208
I need you by my side.

234
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,333
LA FORGE:
Besides, Worf,
if Engineering

235
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,458
is anything like the Bridge

236
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,834
I'm going to have
my hands full.

237
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,125
(<i> ship's whistle sounds</i> )

238
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,417
Attention crew
of the USS<i> Hathaway.</i>

239
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,542
This is your Captain.

240
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,125
Over the next two days,

241
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,542
you might lose
a lot of sleep

242
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,458
but with your skill
and your stamina

243
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,458
we'll have this
old lady ready to fly.

244
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,291
I want hourly progress reports
from all stations.

245
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,166
Riker out.

246
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,750
(<i> generators coming on-line</i> )

247
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,583
(<i> engines powering up</i> )

248
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,667
Nice job, Geordi.

249
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,583
Now what are the possibilities
of warp drive?

250
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,125
Hmm...

251
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,667
not good.

252
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,417
There are only a few
dilithium fragments left

253
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,083
in the holding clamps.

254
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,333
Even if we had crystals
that were intact

255
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,750
there's no antimatter
to fuel the drive.

256
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,959
RIKER:
Any recommendations?

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,166
No, sir.

258
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,333
We haven't got a prayer.

259
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,166
Would you like
to transfer back

260
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,166
to the<i> Enterprise,</i>
Mr. Crusher?

261
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,375
No, sir.

262
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:41,291
Wes, remember our purpose
is to improvise.

263
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,875
It's the effort that counts.

264
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:50,458
Open.

265
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,959
I believe the rules
are understood by all.

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,166
Weapons conversion,
Lieutenant Burke?

267
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,417
Complete, Captain.

268
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,709
Signal received.

269
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,250
Locked on.

270
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,041
She's really been
stripped down, Captain.

271
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,083
The only offensive
systems you'll need

272
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,709
will be simulated
by computer.

273
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,208
What's the Zakdornian word
for mismatch?

274
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,583
Challenge.

275
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,917
We do not whine
about the inequities of life.

276
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,750
And how you perform
in a mismatch

277
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:17,083
is precisely what is of interest
to Starfleet.

278
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,166
After all, when one is
in the superior position

279
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,542
one is expected to win.

280
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,709
Screen off.

281
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,875
You have the Bridge, Mr. Data.
Aye, sir.

282
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:32,333
Lieutenant Commander
Data, I'm intrigued
by your challenge.

283
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,750
Dr. Pulaski informed
me of your desire

284
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,875
to play a game
of Strategema.

285
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:42,250
But I expressed
no such interest.

286
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,792
What Commander Data
means is that

287
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:46,208
he would never have
asked you himself.

288
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,083
But I know that he's
very interested

289
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,917
in pitting his skill
against yours.

290
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,125
Play against a machine.
Hmm.

291
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,250
Why should I wish to?

292
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,875
I don't blame you.

293
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,041
It's no fun
going into a game

294
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,375
when you know
you're going to lose.

295
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,625
But I wouldn't lose.

296
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,834
Now you're no doubt
going to tell me

297
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,667
that I have to prove it to you.

298
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:07,458
Come on, Data, you
can't let that pass.

299
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,333
Indeed, I...

300
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,792
(<i> inaudible</i> )

301
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,709
Cannot.

302
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,834
Then you will play
for the honor of your ship.

303
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,166
Hmm, hmm-hmm.

304
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,166
The honor of the ship?

305
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,792
It's your reputation
that's on the line.

306
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,917
With my knowledge

307
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,250
of the<i> Enterprise's</i>
security override

308
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,959
we may be able
to convince the sensors

309
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,834
that an enemy ship
is approaching.

310
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,750
Their instruments
would... lie to them.

311
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,417
If you can pull
that off, Mr. Worf

312
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,500
you might give us the
edge we're looking for.

313
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,333
But what about the viewscreen?

314
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,000
If I am successful,
the computer will project

315
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:58,917
a false image of the enemy ship
on the main viewscreen.

316
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,500
So unless someone runs
to a window and looks out...

317
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,583
They're going to fall for it.

318
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,166
The lining's still smooth.

319
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,500
We should be able
to do something

320
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,625
with these dilithium
fragments we scavenged.

321
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,333
Sure, the system's functional

322
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:31,041
but, without antimatter,
what difference does it make?

323
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,083
Geordi, I have to return
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

324
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,667
Wes, we've
only got 32 hours.

325
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:39,792
This is important.

326
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,333
And this isn't?

327
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:46,000
Attempt the routing
bypass here.

328
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,250
If it works, they
will be surprised.

329
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,917
Where I'm I going to get
the opti-cable?

330
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,959
Anywhere.

331
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,792
Captain.

332
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,709
I left an experiment running
back on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

333
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,291
May I go back
and shut it down?

334
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,333
It's that important?

335
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,834
Well, it has
to be monitored.

336
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,250
And it is my final grade
in plasma physics.

337
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,375
Message from the<i> Hathaway, sir.</i>

338
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,500
On screen.

339
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:22,959
RIKER:
Request permission
for Ensign Crusher

340
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,250
to reboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

341
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,083
Why?

342
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,000
Apparently, he was so anxious
to join the away team

343
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,750
he left a very critical
experiment unattended.

344
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,291
Do you have
any objection?

345
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,250
He should be escorted
and have no contact

346
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:40,208
with anything
save his research.

347
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,750
Permission granted.

348
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:43,792
Mr. Burke, will you handle that?

349
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,166
Aye, sir.

350
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,500
I saw no sense
in Riker choosing him anyway.

351
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,750
He's just
a noncommissioned child.

352
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,750
I can't believe
I forgot about this.

353
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,917
It's a good lesson
not to let excitement
cloud your judgment.

354
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:58,959
Yeah.

355
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,041
This is very delicate.

356
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,959
I spent six weeks
setting this up.

357
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,458
That's a lot of work.

358
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,583
Oh, no.
This is ruined.

359
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,166
That's too bad.

360
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,542
Look, uh, is this going
to take much longer?

361
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,750
I'm going to have to
dispose of this safely.

362
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:16,041
This is very volatile.

363
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,500
I'll beam it
off the<i> Enterprise</i>

364
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:18,583
and leave it
particalized.

365
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,959
That's fine.
Let's just do it.

366
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
All right, I'll transfer
the coordinates

367
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,041
to the Transporter Room.

00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,875
In the present context

00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,959
what did she mean
by "bust him up"?

372
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,583
In her own way

373
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,500
Dr. Pulaski was
instructing you to take

374
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:09,000
the shortest route
to victory.

375
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,417
As opposed to what?

376
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,166
Ready?

377
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,667
Begin.

Oh, look at them.

381
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,291
Good, Data.

Oh...

Harder, harder.

387
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,083
There.

Come on.

(<i> computer beeps</i> )

390
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,709
I can't believe it.

391
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,792
A computer beaten
by flesh and blood?

392
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,417
(<i> hissing</i> )

393
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,458
You advanced quite far
against such a worthy opponent.

394
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,959
Thoroughly
enjoyable, Mr. Data.

395
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,291
I'm at your disposal
for a rematch.

396
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,875
Thank you,
but what would be the point?

397
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:04,500
Hmm, hmm-hmm.

398
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,291
How can you lose?

399
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,250
You're supposed
to be infallible.

400
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,083
Obviously, I am not.

401
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,625
Ensign, where is
Commander Data?

402
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:25,583
He has temporarily removed
himself from Bridge duty, sir.

403
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,458
Your crew is excellently
trained, Captain.

404
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,834
A tribute to your leadership.

405
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,250
Although I doubt
their extensive preparation

406
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,667
will be needed.

407
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:39,417
Why is that?

408
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,917
I do not expect
"Captain" Riker

409
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:43,959
will present
much of a challenge.

410
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:49,583
Mr. Kolrami, may I speak
with you in private?

411
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,667
I would like to know the
root of your prejudice

412
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:03,458
for my First Officer.
Oh, Captain, I don't...

413
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,291
Mr. Kolrami, you
have been nothing

414
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,667
but denigrating and abusive
of Commander Riker

415
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:10,458
since coming
aboard this ship.

416
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,208
Now, I would like
some explanation.

417
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,667
Having studied
William Riker's file

418
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,250
prior to this assignment

419
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:21,333
I have found
him... wanting.

420
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,834
In what regard?

421
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:28,208
His work record
is exemplary.

422
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,834
But, as you know

423
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:34,792
a Starship Captain
is not manufactured.

424
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:38,041
He or she is born

425
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,959
from-from inside

426
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,542
from the character
of the individual.

427
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,667
My interviews
have revealed a man

428
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,750
who displays
circumstantially

429
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:49,291
inappropriate joviality

430
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,125
belying the seriousness
of his station.

431
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,875
Don't confuse style with intent.

432
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,792
Only a fool would question

433
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,750
Commander Riker's dedication
to Starfleet

434
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:06,166
and the men and women
under his command.

435
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:10,000
He is simply the finest officer
with whom I have ever served.

436
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:12,291
We shall see

437
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,375
if your faith

438
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:16,625
is well-founded.

439
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,709
The test is whether
the crew will follow

440
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,375
where Commander Riker leads.

441
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:23,291
His...

442
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,834
His joviality is the means

443
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:29,333
by which he creates
that loyalty.

444
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,583
And I will match
his command style

445
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,959
with your statistics anytime.

446
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,625
Hmm.

447
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,667
(<i> door chime</i> )

448
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:43,000
Come in, please.

449
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,667
Data.

450
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:49,875
Counselor

451
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:51,083
is something the matter?

452
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,917
That was going to be
my question.

453
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,709
With my repository of knowledge

454
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,250
I expected to perform better
against a humanoid life-form.

455
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,500
You know,
some of our greatest advances

456
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,166
have come
from analyzing failure.

457
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,291
While it can be
ego-bruising...

458
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,709
But, Counselor,
I do not have an ego.

459
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,500
Yes.

460
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:17,291
Well, um... a loss
can be disheartening...

461
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,834
But, Counselor,
I do not have a...

462
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,208
Data.

463
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,041
You can handle defeat
in two ways.

464
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,583
You can lose confidence

465
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,583
or you can learn
from your mistakes.

466
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,792
That is what troubles me.

467
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:34,583
I made no mistakes.

468
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,125
I have conducted
a diagnostic check

469
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,625
of all of my programs.

470
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,583
I'm now cross-checking
with the ship's computer.

471
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,041
Is that all
necessary?

472
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,709
I believe so.

473
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,125
I have proven to be vulnerable.

474
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,709
At the present time,
my deductions should be

475
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,125
treated with skepticism.

476
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,542
So, that's why you haven't
been on the Bridge.

477
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,208
Yes.

478
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,625
The Captain would be ill-advised
to rely upon my judgment.

479
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,750
I think you're overreacting.

480
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,667
I'm sure you're all right.

481
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:07,917
I, however, am not sure.

482
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,625
Easy now.

483
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:20,792
Is that it?

484
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:22,917
Yeah.

485
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,542
Good work.

486
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,875
All right.

487
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,291
Hand me that connector
on the kit.

488
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:35,166
RIKER:
What is that?

489
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,291
My experiment
from the<i> Enterprise.</i>

490
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,667
Wes.

491
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,875
It deals with high-energy
plasma reactions

492
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,291
with antimatter.

493
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,750
You went back
to the<i> Enterprise</i> for that?

494
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:50,583
Wes, you cheated.

495
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,542
No, sir.

496
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,250
You told me to improvise.

497
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:54,959
LA FORGE:
The hard part is going
to be calibrating

498
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,208
the thermal curve necessary

499
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,750
to start
a controlled reaction.

500
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:03,667
Assuming you can,
can you regulate the reaction?

501
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,083
There's just enough crystal
left to do it.

502
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:15,458
We plan to channel the reaction
through the chips.

503
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,625
Are we good?

504
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:17,917
You're better than good.

505
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,125
Great, brilliant.

506
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:20,166
It's going to be fun.

507
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,583
Carry on.

508
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,709
(<i> door chime</i> )

509
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,041
Come in, please.

510
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:35,166
All right, Data,
enough of this.

511
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,375
Doctor?

512
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:38,000
How long are you going
to sit sulking

513
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,750
like Achilles in his tent?

514
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:41,625
I'm conducting diagnostic...

515
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,125
You may be able to sell
Troi that story

516
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:44,583
but not me.

517
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:46,667
Now, you're smarting
because you were beaten.

518
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:48,333
Well, it happens.

519
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,000
No, Doctor, this
is not about ego.

520
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:54,166
I am concerned about giving
the Captain unsound advice.

521
00:26:56,709 --> 00:27:00,750
I wish I had never maneuvered
you into playing that game.

522
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:02,375
I'm sorry.

523
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:03,875
Why, Doctor?

524
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:06,542
It is done,
and perhaps just as well.

525
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,792
This has indicated that I am
damaged in some fashion.

526
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,834
I must find the malfunction.

527
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,875
RIKER:
The simulation begins
in one hour.

528
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,208
You'll have warp
drive, Captain

529
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,125
though it may not be
what you expected.

530
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,750
I think that deserves
some kind of explanation.

531
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:33,125
We'll have warp 1
for about...

532
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,542
Just under two seconds.

533
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:35,875
That's not long enough
or an escape

534
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:37,250
but, used as a surprise

535
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,750
it may give
a strategic advantage.

536
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:40,667
Sir, all of this
is theoretical.

537
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,542
And if your theory
fails to pay off?

538
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:45,375
Have you ever driven
a Grenthemen water hopper?
Sure.

539
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:46,834
Ever popped the clutch?

540
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,458
You're saying we're going
to stall the<i> Hathaway?</i>

541
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,333
And the<i> Enterprise</i>
will waltz right over

542
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,709
and pulverize us.

543
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,333
Now, let me try to understand.

544
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,959
You're saying
that Commander Data

545
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,417
is suffering from

546
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:12,750
a profound
loss of confidence

547
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,000
and that you believe

548
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,583
that only I can
restore the balance?

549
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:17,625
Yes, sir.

550
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:19,125
Both Deanna
and I have tried

551
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:21,083
but we're not getting
through to him.

552
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:25,000
Don't you think you both might
be overreacting?

553
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:26,959
Data is not capable
of the emotions

554
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,625
which you're assigning him.

555
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:29,917
The effects are the same

556
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,041
whether they're caused
by human emotions

557
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,041
or android algorithms.

558
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,667
Data's not on the Bridge,
and I don't think

559
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:37,625
Data's going to be
on the Bridge

560
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,166
until we find some way
to address his problem.

561
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:45,917
I'm less than one hour away
from a battle simulation

562
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:48,917
and I have to handhold
an android.

563
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:51,792
The burdens of command.

564
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:58,542
(<i> door chime</i> )

565
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:01,041
Come in, please.

566
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,917
Commander, I require
your presence on the Bridge.

567
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:07,500
Captain, with
all due respect

568
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,250
perhaps it would be better
if you choose another

569
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,834
to serve as your First Officer.

570
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,667
Data, you are
my First Officer.

571
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:16,625
I have not been able
to isolate the problem, sir.

572
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,250
I might make a mistake.

573
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:21,792
Yes, you might

574
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:25,834
but that does not alter your
duty to me and to this ship.

575
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,625
Now, do you know
how to formulate a premise?

576
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,542
Yes, sir.
Then formulate this one.

577
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:34,041
How do I deal with Commander
Riker and the<i> Hathaway?</i>

578
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:35,834
I will await your answer
on the Bridge.

579
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,625
And, Commander...

580
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:43,709
it is possible
to commit no mistakes

581
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,041
and still lose.

582
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,333
That is not
a weakness.

583
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,709
That is life.

584
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,750
I believe I understand, sir.

585
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,959
And, Data, will you leave
your hesitation and self-doubt

586
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,542
here in your quarters.

587
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,041
I have several examples

588
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:17,583
of Commander Riker's
battle technique.

589
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:21,667
At the Academy, he calculated
a sensory blind spot

590
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:24,208
on a Tholian vessel
and hid within it

591
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,875
during a battle
simulation.

592
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:28,792
And, as a Lieutenant
aboard the<i> Potemkin</i>

593
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:31,750
his solution to a crisis
was to shut down all power

594
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:34,709
and hang over a planet's
magnetic poles

595
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,917
thus confusing
his opponent's sensors.

596
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:39,750
And from these specifics

597
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:42,875
what general conclusion
can you extrapolate?

598
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:44,417
Only 21% of the time

599
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,166
does he rely
on traditional tactics.

600
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:49,458
So...

601
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,208
the Captain must be prepared
for unusual cunning.

602
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:57,709
Counselor, Commander Riker
will assume

603
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,208
we have made this analysis

604
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,834
and knowing
that we know his methods

605
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:03,333
he will alter them.

606
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,709
But knowing that he knows
that we know that he knows

607
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,250
he might choose to return
to his usual pattern.

608
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:12,834
Wait, wait, you're
overanalyzing, Data.

609
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:17,625
One cannot deny human nature.

610
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,000
What kind of a man
is Commander Riker?

611
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:23,834
A fighter?

612
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,208
Yes.

613
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,542
The weaker his position

614
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:29,709
the more aggressive
will be his posture.

615
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,667
And he won't give up.

616
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:36,625
Then, despite whatever
options he is given

617
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:37,667
he must be...

618
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:40,083
The man that he is.
Exactly.

619
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,500
Is that a failing in humans?

620
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,792
You'll have to decide that
for yourself.

621
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,792
On screen.

622
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,583
The hunt begins, Number One.

623
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:10,625
We're ready.

624
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,875
Just remember,<i> Enterprise</i>

625
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:14,959
Captain Riker's never lost.

626
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,208
KOLRAMI:
Begin now.

627
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,917
Screen off.

628
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:23,000
Set course 2-2-3 mark 3-5-7,

629
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,291
full impulse power.

630
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,792
Initiate Kumeh maneuver.

631
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,709
Kumeh maneuver?

632
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,667
Why would they start out
with such a recognizable ploy?

633
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:36,041
He's teasing.

634
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,125
He wants us to reveal
our tactics on his terms.

635
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,291
Mr. Worf?

636
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,125
Counter with
the Talupian maneuver

637
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:42,333
on instrument sighting.

638
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,750
Agreed.
Three-quarter impulse,

639
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:44,792
full on my command.

640
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:46,625
Ensign Nagel, maximum shields.

641
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:49,291
Mr. Worf, prepare
your little surprise.

642
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,333
Aye, sir.

643
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:54,667
PICARD:
Set course 3-1-7 mark 7-3.

644
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:56,792
Present minimal aspect.

645
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:58,041
Ready warp 1.

646
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,000
Optimal spread
on simulated torpedoes.

647
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:02,834
BURKE:
Captain

648
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:04,917
Romulan warship approaching
fast from astern.

649
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:05,917
What the...

650
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,542
He came out of nowhere, sir.

651
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:08,959
Bring us about, Ensign.
Maximum shields.

652
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,333
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

653
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,875
Full weapon systems.
DATA:
Disengage...

654
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:13,417
Lock on, open a
hailing frequency.

655
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,125
I can't, sir.
There's nothing there.

656
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:17,333
(<i> loud electronic beeps</i> )

657
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,500
Warp 3, evasive.

658
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,542
Stand by.

659
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:27,041
Disengage weapons and shields.

660
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,000
Reengage modified beam.

661
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,583
He's quite good.

662
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:31,959
He's the best.

663
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Computer reports
simulated damage

664
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,083
to several aft decks, sir.

665
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,875
Repair time 3.6 Days.

666
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:39,583
How did he do that?

667
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:42,333
Mr. Worf must have overridden
the sensor codes

668
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,041
played some
holographic games.

669
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:47,709
Mr. Data, input a new code.

670
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,625
Attack posture,
circumvental attitude.

671
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:54,667
Prepare beams for photon mode.

672
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,583
(<i> quietly):</i>
Bye-bye,<i> Hathaway.</i>

673
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,875
Computers report heavy damage
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

674
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:04,917
WESLEY:
They're moving off, sir.

675
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,250
Why not go after them?

676
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,709
Because they're not through
coming after us.

677
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,458
Wesley, Geordi,
prepare to warp jump.

678
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
There are no
guarantees here, sir.

679
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:12,583
There never are, Lieutenant.

680
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:13,709
I'm going to trust your
expertise.

681
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,709
Secure your stations.

682
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,000
Stand by for my signal.

683
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,875
Ready the photon torpedoes.

684
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:24,000
Captain, sensors picking up
a Ferengi warship

685
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,291
closing
at warp 5.

686
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,792
Did you input that new code?

687
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,166
Aye, sir.

688
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:33,375
Mr. Worf, I didn't give you
enough credit.

689
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:35,583
Continue the simulation.

690
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:37,041
Divert all power to shields.

691
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,542
Sever modified beams.

692
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,041
Stay between the Ferengi
and the<i> Hathaway.</i>

693
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,291
Engage phasers
and target.

694
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,667
PICARD:
Fire when ready.

695
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,417
That's no ghost attacking
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

696
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:48,458
That's real.

697
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,834
We must assist, sir.

698
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:50,792
With what?

699
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:52,166
We have no
offensive weapons.

700
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,667
Where are my weapons?

701
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:55,000
BURKE:
Unavailable, sir.

702
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,917
We cannot disengage
the modified beams.

703
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:59,208
The connections have been fused.

704
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,583
We must retreat.

705
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,917
Unacceptable.

706
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,333
The Ferengi have broken off
their attack.

707
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:08,917
Drop shields, transport
the away team aboard.

708
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,667
Transporter functions gone, sir.

709
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,291
Shields reduced
to 1/5 intensity.

710
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,458
Use their moment of
indecision to escape.

711
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
I have 40 crew members
onboard the<i> Hathaway...</i>

712
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:18,542
Who should be sacrificed
to save a thousand.

713
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,500
Acceptable tactical losses,
considering the circumstances.

714
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:24,166
Not to me.

715
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,291
Notify Starfleet,
priority.

716
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,583
Hail the Ferengi on my command.

717
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,792
Formulate alternatives.

718
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,208
As the Starfleet
observer

719
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,291
I am ordering
you to withdraw.

720
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,583
I am the Captain of this vessel.

721
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:35,709
Your order is nullified.

722
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,041
Ferengi on main viewscreen.

723
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,792
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard

724
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:47,417
of the Federation Starship
USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

725
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:49,750
Why have you attacked my vessel?

726
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:51,917
Why was your ship combative

727
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,834
with another Federation vessel

728
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:56,208
of lesser design?

729
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,834
Why do you now protect

730
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,500
your former target?

731
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:03,041
What is its value to you?

732
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,500
Our probes indicate
you were aware

733
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:08,166
of our approach,
yet took no action.

734
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:12,041
Your answers will dictate
our response.

735
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:18,083
We have refrained
from launching a counterattack

736
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:21,000
in the hope that this
can be resolved peacefully.

737
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:24,834
Our probes indicate
that you are crippled

738
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:28,500
and the ship you protect
has no weaponry

739
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:30,333
no light-speed drive

740
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,917
and only a scarce crew.

741
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:35,625
This makes no
sense to us.

742
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:39,667
Unless it contains
something very valuable.

743
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:41,792
I am Bractor,

744
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:45,041
leader of the Ferengi
attack vessel<i> Kreechta.</i>

745
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,834
I will have the secret

746
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,750
of the other
Federation ship.

747
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,458
Surrender it to me

748
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,041
and I will allow
your<i> Enterprise</i>

749
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,041
to leave unharmed.

750
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,875
You have ten of your minutes.

751
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,834
Sir, they're massing
a surge of power.

752
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:11,875
We're being scanned.

753
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:14,917
They've locked on.

754
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,834
Data?

755
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,709
Our shields will not withstand
another assault, sir.

756
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,834
Then there are no options.

757
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,959
Retreat...

758
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,417
or die.

759
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:36,375
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

760
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,917
<i>Due to a miscalculation</i>
<i>on my part</i>

761
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:40,583
<i>the</i> Enterprise
<i>has been subjected</i>

762
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,041
<i>to a surprise attack</i>
<i>by the Ferengi.</i>

763
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:46,375
<i>I find myself with little time</i>
<i>to decide the fate</i>

764
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:50,083
<i>of 40 of my crew stranded</i>
<i>aboard the derelict</i> Hathaway.

765
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:52,875
I am open
to suggestions.

766
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,125
Captain, we are now capable
of launching

767
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:57,375
a limited number
of photon torpedoes.

768
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:59,083
I've already given you
my advice, Captain.

769
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:01,291
The<i> Hathaway</i>
is expendable.

770
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:04,083
Commander Riker
is hailing, sir.

771
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,417
On screen.

772
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,834
Number One, have you been
monitoring communications?

773
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,500
Yes, sir.
Kolrami's right.

774
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:12,959
You've got to save
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

775
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,667
That would leave you
defenseless.

776
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:19,375
When Bractor closes in,
we'll hit our warp drive.

777
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:21,583
Take our chances.

778
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,041
Your what?

779
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,291
We have a limited
two-second warp capability.

780
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:28,709
Impossible! That ship was
rendered warp inactive.

781
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,834
I told you
he was the best.

782
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,083
I'd like to hear more
about this, Number One, later.

783
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,500
Right now, I have to work
something out with Mr. Data.

784
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:41,667
Premise-- the Ferengi wish
to capture the<i> Hathaway</i>

785
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,333
believing it to be of value.

786
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:45,000
Therefore, we must remove
the ship

787
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:46,583
from their field of interest.

788
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,417
And they will soon relocate it
after a two second warp...

789
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,041
There is a way.

790
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,375
Number One, can
you hear this?

791
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,083
Yes, sir, we're all here.

792
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,667
Waiting for you to
pull another rabbit
out of your hat.

793
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,959
Mr. Data?

794
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,208
On the Captain's command

795
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,542
we will fire
four photon torpedoes

796
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,792
directly at the<i> Hathaway.</i>

797
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:05,959
One millisecond
after its detonation

798
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,125
the computer will trigger
your warp jump.

799
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,625
I think I hate this plan.

800
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:12,667
Data, we're not even sure
our warp jump will work.

801
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:14,625
If the warp engines
fail to function

802
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:17,709
the result could be...
unfortunate.

803
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:21,125
WORF:
Very unfortunate.

804
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:22,792
We will be dead.

805
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:24,291
PICARD:
Captain Riker

806
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,417
I cannot order you to do this.

807
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:29,667
What the hell,
nobody said life was safe.

808
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:32,625
The advantage is
that it will appear

809
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:36,709
from the<i> Kreechta's</i> perspective<i> </i>
as though...

810
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,291
as though you were destroyed
in the explosion.

811
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:43,333
That will deceive them
only for a few minutes.

812
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,417
Their sensors
will soon locate us.

813
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,291
We'll only need a few minutes,
Mr. Worf

814
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:50,875
because you're going to prepare
another surprise for them.

815
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:53,000
PICARD:
Then we're agreed.

816
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,792
On my mark, four minutes.

817
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,291
DATA:
Remember, Geordi...

818
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,625
if the implementation
is off by one millisecond

819
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,291
the<i> Hathaway</i> will not survive.

820
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,125
Data, that's the one part
of this plan

821
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,834
that we're all
absolutely sure about.

822
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,083
Are we ready, Number One?

823
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:19,709
Ready, Captain.
Ready, Captain.

824
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,166
Good luck to both of you.

825
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:24,500
Bractor.

826
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:31,166
I will wait
no longer, Picard.

827
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,291
You needn't.

828
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,583
The answer is no.

829
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:35,625
Your actions
have been wholly criminal.

830
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,542
You will not profit by them.

831
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:40,083
You are a fool.

832
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:41,959
How can you stop us?

833
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,458
You believe
the<i> Hathaway</i> has value?

834
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,208
We deny you your prize.

835
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,583
Fire.

836
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,041
Destroy your own
rather than suffer

837
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:59,458
the ignominy of defeat
and capture?

838
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,667
I did not think
the Federation
had such iron.

839
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:05,583
You had no claim on that vessel.

840
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,542
It was ours to destroy.

841
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:08,959
As you

842
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,875
are ours to destroy.

843
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:13,875
You can try.

844
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,250
<i>Enterprise</i>
targeted, Leader.

845
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:20,875
Leader, there is another
Federation ship closing.

846
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,333
A starship.

847
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:26,166
Maximum shields.

848
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:27,917
We have been outmaneuvered.

849
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,250
Retreat.

850
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:36,667
Captain, our sensors
show no Federation
starship nearby.

851
00:41:36,709 --> 00:41:38,000
RIKER:
Of course not, Mr. Burke.

852
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:39,875
That was Klingon guile.

853
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,208
You made it, Number One.

854
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,375
Smooth ride?

855
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,875
Well, it certainly
was different.

856
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,166
We'll lock on and pick you up.

857
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:49,583
With pleasure, Captain.

858
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:57,625
Uh...
I must admit,

859
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:59,417
your Commander Riker

860
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:03,250
acquitted himself
quite admirably.

861
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:07,083
And so, Captain

862
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,583
have you.

863
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:12,166
My report
to Starfleet

864
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:14,250
will be most favorable.

865
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:15,250
Thank you.

866
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:18,208
Hmm, hmm-hmm.

867
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,542
Initiate recovery procedures.

868
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:22,417
Continue repairs.

869
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,333
Plot a course
for the nearest Starbase.

870
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:30,583
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

871
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:33,667
<i>With the transporter repaired</i>
<i>and my crew safely back aboard</i>

872
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:35,458

00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,667
<i>our first Starfleet</i>

Come on, come on.

876

Don't lose it.
Don't lose it.

877
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:51,500
Come on.
You've got him.

878
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,917
Come on, Data.
Come on, Data.

879
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:55,375
Come on, Data.
Come on.

880

(<i> encouragement continues</i> )

881
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:24,500
(<i> exclamation of disgust</i> )

882
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:25,500
Why have you suspended the game?

883
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:26,458
Because this

884
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,166
is not a rematch.

885
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:30,500
You have made a mockery of me.

886
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:35,542
Data, you beat him.

887
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,750
No, sir, it is a stalemate.

888
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:40,041
No game of Strategema
has ever gone this high.

889
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,583
What did
you do?

890
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,834
I simply altered my premise
for playing the game.

891
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:44,792
Explain.

892
00:43:44,834 --> 00:43:46,250
Working under the assumption

893
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,917
that Kolrami
was attempting to win

894
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,542
it is reasonable to assume

895
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,542
that he expected me
to play for the same goal.

896
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,667
You didn't.

897
00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:55,542
No, I was playing
for a standoff.

898
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,458
A draw.

899
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,583
While Kolrami
was dedicated to winning

900
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:02,333
I was able to pass up
obvious avenues of advancement

901
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:04,208
and settle for a balance.

902
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,750
Theoretically, I should be able
to challenge him indefinitely.

903
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:10,458
Then you<i> have</i> beaten him.

904
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,333
It is a matter of perspective,
Doctor.

905
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:15,000
In the strictest sense,
I did not win.

906
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,792
Data.
Data.

907
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:19,542
I busted him up.

908
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,333
(<i> all cheering</i> )
