1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,625
Graves at my command
have wak'd their sleepers.

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:10,583
Op'd, and let 'em forth
by my so potent art.

3
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:14,750
But this rough magic
I here abjure,

4
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:18,041
and when I have requir'd
some heavenly music--

5
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,583
which even now I do--

6
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,917
to work mine end
upon their senses

7
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:26,917
that this airy charm
is for,

8
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:29,583
I'll break my staff,

9
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:33,834
bury it certain fathoms
in the earth,

10
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:38,375
and deeper
than did ever plummet sound,

11
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:40,166
I'll...

12
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,875
Captain?

13
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,083
Sir, your attention
is wandering.

14
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,250
Data, I can
barely see you.

15
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,000
But, sir, I am supposed
to be attempting

16
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:52,333
a Neoplatonic
magical rite.

17
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,709
The darkness
is appropriate

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,959
for such a ritual.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,750
Yes, but, Data,
this is a play.

20
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,792
The audience
has to see you.

21
00:00:58,834 --> 00:00:59,959
Hmm.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,291
Perhaps I have been
too literal

23
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,625
with respect
to my set design.

24
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,959
Computer,
modify holodeck program

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,500
Data 7-3, Shakespeare's
<i>The Tempest,</i>

26
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:10,375
Act Five, Scene One.

27
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:13,625
Increase torch
light by... 20%.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,875
There, that's
much better.

29
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,208
Now, do you want
to try it again?

30
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,125
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:25,458
Captain, I am not certain
I fully understand

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,458
this Prospero character.

33
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,125
I would appreciate any
insight you might have

34
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:33,542
that would improve
my performance.

35
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,792
Well, Data,
Shakespeare was witnessing

36
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:38,083
the end of
the Renaissance

37
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,250
and the birth
of the modern era,

38
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,083
and Prospero

39
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,458
finds himself
in a world

40
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,834
where his powers
are no longer needed.

41
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,291
So, we see him here
about to perform

42
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,208
one final creative act

43
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,458
before giving up
his art forever.

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,166
Hmm. There is
certainly

45
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,917
a tragic aspect
to the character.

46
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,542
Yes, but there's a--

47
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,375
(<i> distant train whistles</i> )
a certain expectancy, too,

48
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:05,208
um, a hopefulness
about the future.

49
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,000
You see, Shakespeare enjoyed
mixing opposites--

50
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,792
the past and--
and the future,

51
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,542
hope and despair...

52
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,291
Data, what is this?

53
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,625
Is this part
of your program?

54
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,250
(<i> train whistling</i> )
DATA: No, sir.

55
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,959
Well, what is going on?

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,333
It appears to be
a steam locomotive.

57
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,625
A train?

58
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,208
If I am not mistaken.

59
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,542
Computer, end program.

60
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,041
(<i> train chugging closer</i> )

61
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,709
Computer,
end program!

62
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,875
(<i> train whistle blowing</i> )

63
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:26,500
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

64
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:30,709
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship Enterprise.</i>

65
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

66
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:36,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

67
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:40,667
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

68
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,542
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

69
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:45,333
Captain?

70
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,750
You are injured.

71
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, yes, I know.
It's all right.

72
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,917
I will get it seen to,
Data.

73
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,875
The train we encountered
was from one of Dr. Crusher's

74
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,250
holodeck programs.

75
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,667
It was a re-creation
of the Orient Express,

76
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:04,792
a train which traveled
from Paris to Istanbul

77
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,375
from the late
19th century...

78
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:08,500
Yes, yes, Data, I know
about the Orient Express,

79
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,000
but what is it doing
on Prospero's island?

80
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,792
There appears to have
been a malfunction

81
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:17,667
in the holodeck's database
retrieval program.

82
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:20,834
The two programs somehow
temporarily linked together.

83
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,542
Is it possible
that this malfunction

84
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,166
would affect
the other holodecks as well?

85
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,166
It is a possibility.
I will need to run

86
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,834
a full diagnostic
to be certain.

87
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,542
Very good, Data,
but shut down

88
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,417
the other holodecks as well
until you're finished,

89
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,792
just to be on
the safe side.

90
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,000
Aye, sir.

91
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:42,250
I never realized that you
were interested in trains.

92
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,000
Are you aware that,
at its peak,

93
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,667
the Orient Express carried
more than 10,000 people a year?

94
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:49,500
It isn't really
the train itself

95
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:50,583
that I'm interested in.

96
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,709
What then?
It's the experience.

97
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,875
The Orient Express is
romantic, mysterious.

98
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,291
It's an elegant way
to see exotic places

99
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,250
and meet
fascinating people.

100
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,875
Do you know that,
one time, on one trip,

101
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,709
both Sigmund Freud
and Gertrude Stein

102
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,792
just happened to be
in the same car?

103
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:11,542
They ended up having dinner
together every night.

104
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,875
I wonder what
they talked about?

105
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,792
Why don't you take a trip
yourself and find out?

106
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,000
RIKER:
Riker to Picard.

107
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,291
Picard here.

108
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,709
All sections ready
to begin the survey, sir.

109
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,125
Very good.
I'm on my way.

110
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,333
Thank you.

111
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,709
Don't forget the trip,
Jean-Luc, think about it.

112
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,667
You never know who you'll meet
on the Orient Express.

113
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:36,083
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

118
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,208
I don't think
there's any possibility

119
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,709
of developing sites
in this region.

120
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,375
Most of the stars are
main sequence binaries.

121
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,709
There are no M-class
planets.

122
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,750
Well, let's move on
to another survey region.

123
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,041
Have stellar
cartography begin a...

124
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,500
Mr. Data, report.

125
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:03,041
The ship has moved
into warp, sir.

126
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,166
RIKER:
Who gave that command?

127
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,667
Apparently, no one.

128
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,709
Helm and navigation controls
are not functioning.

129
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,208
Our speed is now
warp 7.3 and holding.

130
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,917
Picard
to Engineering.

131
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,291
Mr. La Forge,
what's going on?

132
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,041
We've lost primary helm
control on the Bridge.

133
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,291
I don't understand it.

134
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,667
The impulse systems
suddenly cut out,

135
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:22,750
and the warp drive just
kicked in.

136
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,291
RIKER:
Geordi, can you take
the engines offline?

137
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,166
I'm working on it.

138
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,834
Mr. Data,
what's our heading?

139
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,750
Bearing 187
mark 4, sir.

140
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,542
I am unable to determine
our destination.

141
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,625
However, we are moving away
from the Mekorda sector.

142
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,208
LA FORGE:
Captain, the computer's locked
out all the propulsion controls.

143
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,500
I can't access
any of the overrides.

144
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,000
If you want us to stop,

145
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,375
I'll have to do
an emergency core shutdown.

146
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,625
That would leave us
without warp power

147
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,333
for more than a week.

148
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,083
Begin the procedure,
Mr. La Forge.

149
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,834
We are no longer
at warp, sir.

150
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,750
Impulse power
has resumed.

151
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,083
All systems
show normal.

152
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,625
Where are we?

153
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,417
We are approximately
30 billion kilometers

154
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,000
from our original
position.

155
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,625
Well done,
Mr. La Forge.

156
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,375
It wasn't me.

157
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:10,917
I didn't have time to complete
the shutdown procedure.

158
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,041
PICARD:
Well, I want an explanation,
Mr. La Forge.

159
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,458
Picard out.

160
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:26,041
Have you found anything yet?

161
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:29,291
Only that we seem to have
more than one mystery here.

162
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,375
We still don't know why
the ship jumped into warp,

163
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:33,750
but it looks like
we're lucky that it did.

164
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,208
There was a theta
flux distortion

165
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,959
building up
around the ship.

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,750
Why didn't
our sensors alert us?

167
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,333
Well, our sensors
were never designed

168
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,959
to detect theta flux
distortions,

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,458
and, yet, there is
a record of the distortion

170
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,834
in our sensor log.

171
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,208
That's the other
mystery.

172
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,125
One fact is clear,
however.

173
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,458
The distortion was
growing in strength.

174
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,291
If we had remained
at our original position

175
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,125
1.7 seconds longer,

176
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,458
the distortion would have
ruptured our warp core.

177
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,500
If the<i> Enterprise</i> hadn't
jumped into warp when it did,

178
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,583
we would have been
blown to pieces.

179
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,333
I don't get it, Data.

180
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,792
What would cause the engines
to suddenly jump into warp?

181
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,375
Perhaps the engines
were activated

182
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,250
by a random
power fluctuation.

183
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,166
Which occurred
just in time

184
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,542
to save the ship?

185
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,000
It is improbable,
but it is possible.

186
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,750
I don't know,
I don't think I'm ready

187
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,917
to start
believing in luck.

188
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,917
There is another
possibility.

189
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,625
Yeah?
What's that?

190
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:59,083
The sensors
apparently detected

191
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,667
a dangerous anomaly that
threatened the<i> Enterprise.</i>

192
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,291
It is possible
that they triggered

193
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,625
a safety device
that caused the ship

194
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,125
to avoid
destruction.

195
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,625
Yeah, but there's
no direct link

196
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,917
between the warp engines
and the sensors.

197
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,500
Whoa, what is that?

198
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:23,417
It looks like some kind
of new circuit node,

199
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,542
and it's connected
to at least...

200
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,291
half a dozen points
on the sensor array.

201
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,667
It appears to be connected
to several other systems

202
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,458
as well, including
the warp control circuits.

203
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,041
Well, I guess there's
a connection between

204
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,875
the warp engines
and the sensors after all.

205
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:42,709
A force field.

206
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,000
Where did that
come from?

207
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,125
I am not certain.

208
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,625
Perhaps it came
from the node itself.

209
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,667
Well, wherever
it came from,

210
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,542
it sure doesn't want us
messing with this node.

211
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,291
It appears to be
protecting itself.

212
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,792
We found these nodes

213
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,917
in several systems
around the ship.

214
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,625
At some level
or another,

215
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:06,875
they're all connected.

216
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,166
These nodes were
linking the sensors

217
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,417
to our warp control
and defensive systems.

218
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,959
We believe this is why
the ship jumped to warp.

219
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,458
When the sensors
detected danger,

220
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
the defensive system
reacted to the threat

221
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,500
and activated
the warp engines
to protect us.

222
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:20,959
Where did the nodes
come from?

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,417
It is possible
the magnascopic storm

224
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,375
we recently
encountered had

225
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,709
an unexpected effect
on the ship's systems.

226
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,583
Wherever they come from,
they seem to be multiplying.

227
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,291
As they increase,
it will become

228
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,875
progressively more difficult
to control the ship.

229
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,667
What do you propose
we do?

230
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:39,333
Well, getting rid of them
isn't going to be so easy.

231
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,750
When we attempted
to examine the circuitry

232
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,667
of one of the nodes,
it generated a force field

233
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,166
to keep us out.

234
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:48,417
Well, whatever's going on,
our first priority

235
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,709
is getting back
control of the ship.

236
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,291
Agreed.

237
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,792
All of the nodal
connections intersect

238
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:55,417
in Holodeck Three.

239
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,500
It appears to be
a focal point of some kind.

240
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:01,083
We might be able to find a way
to use the holodeck's circuitry

241
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,667
to disable
the nodes permanently.

242
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,417
All right,
let's do it.

243
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,959
Commander, the holodeck
appears to be in operation.

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,041
I thought you shut down
the entire system.

245
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,125
I did, but it has
reactivated itself,

246
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,083
and it will not
disengage.

247
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,709
Which program is
running?

248
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,625
Several different programs
are running simultaneously.

249
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,834
This should be
interesting.

250
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,834
(<i> train wheels rumbling</i> )

251
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,583
(<i> spurs jingling</i> )

252
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,834
You weren't kidding,
Mr. Data.

253
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,583
No, sir.

254
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,291
I estimate that
this... scene

255
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,750
consists of portions

256
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:41,917
of seven distinct
holodeck programs.

257
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,291
See if you can
access the circuits

258
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,375
that have been
affected by the nodes.

259
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,917
(<i> train whistle blows</i> )

260
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:08,291
Tickets.
Tickets, please.

261
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,667
Please have
your tickets ready.

262
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,709
Thank you, sir.

263
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,917
Thank you, madam.

264
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,875
Here you are.
Thank you.

265
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,667
Thank you, sir.

266
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:20,000
Tickets, please.

267
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,750
You know, I never even
been away from home.

268
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:24,375
Now I'm going all the way
to Vertiform City.

269
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,875
Very nice, sir.

270
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:28,291
Enjoy your trip.
Tickets, please.

271
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,125
Tickets?
Thank you, sir.

272
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,333
Tickets, please.

273
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,583
Tickets, please.

274
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,041
DATA:
Commander?
Tickets.

275
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,792
I've located a large
concentration of nodes

276
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,208
behind this wall.

277
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,959
They appear to be
connected directly

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,041
to the holodeck's
main power coupling.

279
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,500
All right, go ahead
and depolarize

280
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,959
the entire power grid.

281
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,417
The power grid is located
beneath this deck, sir.

282
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,000
CONDUCTOR:
Get away from there!

283
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,291
Would you gentlemen care
to show me your tickets?

284
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,959
I believe we left our tickets
in our compartments.

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,417
Mr. Worf, I told you
to bring the tickets.

286
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,208
I, uh, forgot.

287
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,875
I don't think you folks
belong on this train.

288
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,792
MAN:
Hold it!

289
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:24,291
You leave these
people alone.

290
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,959
They're only
trying to help.

291
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,083
You go back
to the engine.

292
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,667
This doesn't concern you.

293
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:34,875
They're all trying
to hijack the train.

294
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:36,750
Hey, if you're
the engineer,

295
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:38,542
who's doing
the driving?

296
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,625
(<i> gunshot</i> )

297
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:50,000
I am.

298
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,417
Easy, sir, easy.
I got you.

299
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,792
I'm all right.
Thanks.

300
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,375
Looks like the navigational
relay's overloaded.

301
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:17,500
(<i> bell ringing</i> )

302
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,000
PICARD:
Geordi, what's going on?

303
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,709
We just went
into warp.

304
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,250
We've lost engine and helm
control again, Captain,

305
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:31,041
but this time...
they're completely burned out.

306
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,417
I don't know if we can
stop the ship.

307
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,792
I believe we have
changed direction.

308
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:40,625
Now we're on
the right track.

309
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,917
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are on our way.

310
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,834
(<i> cheering</i> )

311
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,709
I was right.

312
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,166
He was trying
to make off with my brick.

313
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,917
Take good care
of that.

314
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:01,709
We can't afford
to lose it.

315
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:05,917
Now, are you people
going to leave,

316
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,959
or do we have to throw you
off the train?

317
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,709
Commander.

318
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,000
According
to my tricorder,

319
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,375
the holodeck safeties
have been disengaged.

320
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,583
His weapon
could be lethal.

321
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,875
All right,
let's get out of here.

322
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,417
The number of systems now
being affected by the nodes

323
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,542
has increased
considerably.

324
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,667
Sensors, engines,
replicators, propulsion--

325
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,458
they're all
working together now,

326
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,834
almost independently
of the main computer,

327
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,583
and the nodes link them all
through the holodeck.

328
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,709
But why the holodeck?
It doesn't make any sense.

329
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,125
Commander, I believe
what happens on the holodeck

330
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,250
has a direct effect
on the ship.

331
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,458
When we attempted
to destroy the nodes,

332
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,041
the characters
on the train

333
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,458
responded
almost immediately

334
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,834
to stop us.

335
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,041
And when the engineer
tried to protect us,

336
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,583
one of the other
characters shot him.

337
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,417
Then the conductor
signaled for the train

338
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,792
to change direction...

339
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,583
and, at approximately
the same time...

340
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,125
The<i> Enterprise</i> also took off
in a new direction.

341
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,750
Are you saying the ship
is under the control
of the holodeck?

342
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,333
Not precisely.

343
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,709
Geordi...

344
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,417
does the configuration
of connection nodes

345
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,250
look familiar to you?

346
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,291
Yeah.

347
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,750
Yeah, it looks
a little like

348
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,834
the structure of your
positronic brain.

349
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,417
DATA:
That is correct.

350
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,166
It would appear that
the nodes are in the process

351
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,166
of creating a rudimentary
neural net.

352
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,583
Data...
what are you suggesting?

353
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,875
Unlikely
as it may sound,

354
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,333
I believe
the<i> Enterprise</i>

355
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,792
<i>may be forming</i>
an intelligence.

356
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:09,625
This is a synaptic map
of the human neocortex.

357
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:12,750
This is a cross-section
of my positronic net.

358
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:15,375
And this is a schematic
of the connection nodes

359
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:17,667
linking
the ship's systems.

360
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:20,166
I believe some sort
of neural matrix

361
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,458
is forming on the ship.

362
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,000
It is still
relatively primitive,

363
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,875
but it is
an intelligence,
nonetheless.

364
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,417
How could
that happen?

365
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,333
I believe it is
an emergent property.

366
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,834
Explain.

367
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,542
Complex systems can
sometimes behave in ways

368
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,458
that are entirely
unpredictable.

369
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,083
The human brain,
for example,

370
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,000
might be described in terms
of cellular functions

371
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,417
and neurochemical
interactions.

372
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,917
But that description

373
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,458
does not explain
human consciousness,

374
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,208
a capacity that far exceeds
simple neural functions.

375
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,875
Consciousness is
an emergent property.

376
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,500
In other words,
something that's more than

377
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:56,792
just the sum of its parts.

378
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,125
DATA:
Exactly.

379
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,375
How does that explain

380
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,875
what's happening
to the<i> Enterprise?</i>

381
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,125
The<i> Enterprise</i> contains
a vast database

382
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,959
of information
which is managed

383
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,834
by a sophisticated
computer.

384
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,583
This complex system

385
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,667
gives the ship many
of the characteristics

386
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,458
of a biological
organism.

387
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,959
That's true-- it sees
with its sensors,

388
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,250
and it talks with
its communications systems.

389
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,959
In a sense,

390
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,333
it almost reproduces
with the replicators.

391
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,959
And you think that
the ship has somehow

392
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,333
gone beyond
these functions.

393
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,166
It's developing
a new capacity.

394
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,917
Yes, sir, I believe

395
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:31,208
a self-determining
intelligence is emerging.

396
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,125
If that is so,
what does the ship want?

397
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,500
Where is it taking us?

398
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:36,959
I believe the key
to understanding

399
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,959
the ship's behavior
lies in the holodeck.

400
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,417
All of the connection nodes
intersect at that location.

401
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,750
It is clearly some kind
of processing center.

402
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,625
Processing center?

403
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,709
Yes, sir.
A focal point

404
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,750
where all the ideas
and instincts

405
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,250
of this emerging
intelligence

406
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,542
are first expressed
in some form.

407
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,917
Almost like
an imagination.

408
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,542
Captain, I'd like to go
to the holodeck.

409
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,500
I could interact
with the characters

410
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,375
and maybe find
some clues

411
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:07,083
to help us understand
what's happening.

412
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,542
Very well.

413
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,208
Mr. Data, Mr. Worf,
I want you to go along.

414
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,375
See if you can reestablish
control of the ship

415
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:15,083
without damaging
the nodes.

416
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,208
If the ship is truly
an emerging intelligence,

417
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,291
then we have
a responsibility

418
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,875
to treat it with the same
respect as any other being.

419
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,041
Welcome aboard,
Counselor.

420
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:45,208
If you will distract
these people,

421
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,417
I will attempt
to depolarize

422
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,834
the power grid.

423
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:56,458
(<i> bell clanging</i> )

424
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:01,417
Excuse me.

425
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,083
Have you finished
the puzzle yet?

426
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,458
Not yet,
but we're getting close.

427
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,125
WORF:
Do you recognize it?

428
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,458
No.

429
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,583
WORF:
I would like to help.

430
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,959
Tell me, what exactly
are you making?

431
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,750
What do you think
we're making? A puzzle.

432
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:34,041
No. No, I meant
the picture.

433
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,250
What is it?

434
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:39,500
Well, I don't know.

435
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,250
Can you deal me in?

436
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,333
Sorry.

437
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,583
It's a two-man game.

438
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:51,709
Hey!

439
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,750
Get your hand
off of that.

440
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,208
Is that why
you killed the engineer?

441
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,709
To get this brick?

442
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,375
I had to get it back.

443
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,250
You know what
it's worth, lady?

444
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,959
Plenty.

445
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,333
And I got to get it
to Keystone City.

446
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,000
Why? What's at
Keystone City?

447
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,667
It's where
everything begins.

448
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,583
Gin.

449
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,000
Are you succeeding,
Commander?

450
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,875
I am ready to access
the main power grid.

451
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:28,083
Keystone City,
next stop.

452
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,291
Keystone City.

453
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,458
Well...

454
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,000
look who's back.

455
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,125
We do not want
any trouble.

456
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,834
We are simply...
passengers.

457
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,709
Well, then I'm sure
you wouldn't mind

458
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,500
showing me
your tickets.

459
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,583
Right.

460
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,583
Sorry, boys.

461
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,500
You're getting off
right here.

462
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,625
This is my stop.

463
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,917
Wait. What happens
at Keystone City?

464
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,417
Why are you taking
the brick there?

465
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,250
Excuse me.

466
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,375
I think we should
follow that man.

467
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,959
That brick might be
an important clue.

468
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,709
Where did he go?

469
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,542
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

470
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,709
(<i> beeping</i> )

471
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:57,500
I can access
the power grid here.

472
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,208
I will attempt
to depolarize the grid

473
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,750
by using a low-frequency
inversion field.

474
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,875
It may disengage the nodes
without destroying them.

475
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:15,667
TROI:
There he is.

476
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:17,083
I'm going after him.

477
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:31,125
(<i> car approaching</i> )

478
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,917
(<i> dog barking</i> )

479
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,750
What are you doing here?

480
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,417
Laying the foundation.

481
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:36,250
Now if youse
will excuse me,

482
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:38,375
I got a train to catch.

483
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:51,000
I don't understand it,
Captain.

484
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:53,667
All of a sudden, Cargo Bay Five
started to depressurize.

485
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:54,875
Did everyone
get out in time?

486
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,208
Yes, sir, and
I've reestablished

487
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,875
the containment field,
but I'm reading

488
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,208
massive power surges
in the cargo bay

489
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,667
and all sorts
of transporter activity--

490
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:03,625
Something weird is
happening there, Captain.

491
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,625
I want you to send a team
down there immediately.

492
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:06,959
Find out
what's going on.

493
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,375
Aye, sir.

494
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,750
La Forge to Bridge.

495
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:38,000
Picard here.
What's going on?

496
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:41,667
I wish I could tell you.

497
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:58,500
That man said he was
laying a foundation.

498
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:00,250
A foundation for what?

499
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,667
Troi to Data.

500
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:04,333
Data here.
How are you doing?

501
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,208
I encountered
a minor difficulty,

502
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,834
Counselor, but it has
been dealt with.

503
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:12,041
(<i> engine revving</i> )

504
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:20,458
I am ready to depolarize
the power grid.

505
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,417
It looks like
the ship's replicator

506
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:33,125
and transporter systems
have been merged somehow

507
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,834
to create this.

508
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:37,750
The question is,
what is it?

509
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:40,333
Ensign, I want you
to run a full

510
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,250
spectral analysis
on this...

511
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,583
(<i> rumbling</i> )

512
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,291
I'm reading massive
power fluctuations.

513
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:52,166
The ship is losing
its structural integrity.

514
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,208
What's happening?

515
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,333
It's an earthquake.

516
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,667
La Forge to Data.
Stop what you're doing.

517
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:08,750
Acknowledged.

518
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,041
Are you all right?

519
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,542
I'm fine.

520
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:21,125
Data, I think
we ought to get together

521
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,542
and compare notes.

522
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,166
DATA:
Agreed.

523
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:32,250
The ship was
protecting itself again--

524
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:34,291
stopping us
from interfering.

525
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,500
Whatever it's doing,
it intends to continue.

526
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,250
I'm betting that all this
has something to do

527
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,792
with that object that's
forming in the cargo bay.

528
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,709
I think he's right,
Captain.

529
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,750
Look at the common themes
playing out on the holodeck--

530
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,291
a puzzle being
put together,

531
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,834
a foundation
being laid,

532
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,125
a paper doll
being fashioned.

533
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,125
They're all images of
something being constructed.

534
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,834
LA FORGE:
And some kind of object

535
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:59,375
in the cargo bay that's being
constructed atom by atom.

536
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:00,667
What is that object?

537
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:01,875
LA FORGE:
I have no idea,

538
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:03,750
but it's composed
of silica polymers,

539
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:05,291
duranium, and a couple
of other compounds

540
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,583
we haven't been able
to identify yet.

541
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:10,000
But creating it has had quite
an effect on our systems.

542
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,834
Warp power has
dropped 47%.

543
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:15,041
Counselor, did you draw
any other conclusions

544
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:18,083
from your experiences
on the holodeck?

545
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,834
Anything that would
help us to understand

546
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,834
this situation?

547
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,875
The holodeck was full
of metaphoric imagery,

548
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:28,250
like it was having
some kind of daydream.

549
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,291
It may not make
literal sense,

550
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:32,041
but symbolically
it probably does

551
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,583
have some kind
of logic to it.

552
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,208
These characters
you spoke to,

553
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,125
do they have
any significance?

554
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:42,000
I think they represent
different aspects of the ship.

555
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,625
The engineer,
for instance,

556
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,625
may represent
the navigational system.

557
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:49,375
The gunslinger could be
the weapon system.

558
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,417
Is there any way that
we can persuade them

559
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,750
to give us back
control of the ship?

560
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:57,333
I don't think it's possible
to reason with them.

561
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:01,709
Many of them are genuinely
unaware of what's going on.

562
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,125
It's as though this
emergent intelligence

563
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:07,417
is like an infant--
acting on impulse,

564
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:10,375
trying to figure
itself out as it goes.

565
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:13,834
The only source of experience
it can draw on is ours,

566
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,542
through our
holodeck programs.

567
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,208
Then, is there
a way that we can

568
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,875
relate to them
on their own level?

569
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:21,709
Find some way to
influence their behavior?

570
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,166
Maybe there is.

571
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:30,208
I'd like to go back
and try.

572
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,166
Counselor,
we haven't been able

573
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:33,875
to reestablish
the safeties.

574
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:36,000
The injuries you suffered
on the holodeck,

575
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,500
weren't severe,

576
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,583
but next time
they might kill you.

577
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,959
I'm aware of that.

578
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:49,417
Very well, Counselor.
Go ahead, but bear in mind

579
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,959
that whenever we have tried
to hinder their efforts,

580
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,250
we've failed.

581
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,542
Perhaps it's time
to cooperate with them.

582
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,542
You don't belong
on this train.

583
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:11,959
Three tickets
for Vertiform City.

584
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,500
Well...

585
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,875
I guess I was wrong
about you folks.

586
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,166
Welcome aboard.

587
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:25,083
What was that?

588
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:26,750
We've been having
some problems.

589
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,750
The engine is
running out of steam.

590
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:33,083
I hope we make it
to Vertiform City on time.

591
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,250
Is there anything
we can do to help?

592
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,000
Well, I could use
a pair of strong arms

593
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:39,125
in the engine room.

594
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,166
Might help us
get back on schedule.

595
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,000
Why don't you go
with him, Worf?

596
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,125
We'll see what
we can do here.

597
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:54,291
Excuse me,
are we gonna
get there okay?

598
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:57,500
Of course. You needn't
worry about a thing.

599
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:01,125
So, tell me everything
you know about Vertiform City.

600
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,709
Well, they got
this restaurant there

601
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,083
where you can eat
all you want, anytime.

602
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:08,125
It's the best
food around.

603
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,458
There's the coal,
and there's the boiler.

604
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,834
I'm much obliged
for your help.

605
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,000
Well done, sir.

606
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:37,041
I think this will make
a big difference, all right.

607
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,500
I don't know
how or why, sir,

608
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:50,417
but warp power appears to be
back at normal levels.

609
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:52,500
What's our heading?

610
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:53,875
We appear to be
on a course

611
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:56,375
for Tambor Beta VI.

612
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,375
It's a white dwarf star.

613
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,625
Keep it steady.

614
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,291
Put your back into it.

615
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,000
That's the ticket!

616
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,625
The ship is using
a modified tractor beam

617
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:21,166
to collect vertion
particles from the star.

618
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:23,375
Vertion particles...

619
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:26,166
Vertiform City--

620
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,208
that's what the ship
was looking for.

621
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,792
(<i> console beeping</i> )

622
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,125
The particles are
being routed through

623
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,959
the transporter system
into Cargo Bay Five.

624
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,375
Geordi,
what's going on?

625
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:41,792
The object is absorbing
vertion particles.

626
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:44,041
It's growing
even faster than before.

627
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,000
Commander...

628
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:49,208
I'm picking up internal energy
from this thing.

629
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,458
What do you mean?

630
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,625
I mean it's generating
its own energy.

631
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:55,542
I'm picking up
coherent emissions,

632
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:58,667
matter conversion...
it's incredible.

633
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:00,709
Wait a minute.

634
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,959
Wait a minute.
Something's wrong.

635
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,583
We've got power
fluctuations.

636
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:08,625
Vertion absorption rate
is dropping.

637
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,959
What's happening
with the particle beam?

638
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,291
The beam's exhausted
the supply of particles

639
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,166
in the star-- there's
nothing left to take out.

640
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:19,750
Captain, the energy output
of the object is decreasing.

641
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:22,208
Something's wrong.

642
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,083
What is it?

643
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,625
This was supposed
to be Vertiform City.

644
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:42,667
We've been on
the wrong track all along.

645
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:47,959
(<i> screaming</i> )

646
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:00,917
Are you all right?

647
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,500
Yes.
What happened?

648
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:05,250
The conductor accidentally
derailed the train.

649
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:06,959
Data to Captain Picard.

650
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,375
Picard here.

651
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,166
There's been an accident
in the holodeck, sir.

652
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:12,083
Has anything happened
on the<i> Enterprise?</i>

653
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,041
Yes, we've had
a ship-wide shutdown.

654
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,417
We've lost
attitude control,

655
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:17,208
and most systems
are offline.

656
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,792
Captain, you'd better
take a look at this.

657
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:24,500
When the particle beam
cut off, the object was

658
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,625
was beginning to form
a coherent energy matrix.

659
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,625
Now, if these readings
are accurate,

660
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:31,291
I'd say that the emission
patterns were almost organic.

661
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,625
Are you suggesting
that the<i> Enterprise</i>

662
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,667
is trying to create
a life-form?

663
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:36,000
I think so.

664
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:37,500
Will it survive?

665
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,500
Well, its energy levels
are dropping rapidly.

666
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:41,583
Unless it gets an infusion
of vertion particles--

667
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:45,000
and I mean soon--
I don't think so.

668
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,458
Captain, all of our systems
are back on line.

669
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,792
We're moving again--
at warp nine.

670
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,166
Let's get back
to the Bridge.

671
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,333
Whoo-ee.

672
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,959
That was a close one,
wasn't it?

673
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,166
Where are we going now?

674
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:12,625
Well, New Vertiform City,
of course.

675
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,959
Data to Captain.
Picard here.

676
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,625
The train has returned
to normal, sir.

677
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,917
Our destination is
New Vertiform City.

678
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,208
What's our course?

679
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,125
We're headed for
the Cordannas system.

680
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:25,083
Another white dwarf star.

681
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,875
It's the nearest one
to our last position.

682
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:29,041
LA FORGE:
Captain...

683
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,750
we have a problem.

684
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,792
Even at warp nine,
the Cordannas system

685
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,125
is over 12 hours
from here.

686
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,583
Will the object in the cargo bay
survive that long?

687
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,458
Yes, sir, but that's
not the problem.

688
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,041
The ship has diverted
all of our systems

689
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:44,875
to maximum propulsion,
including life support.

690
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:47,792
We have less than
two hours of reserve oxygen.

691
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:50,667
Mr. Data, we have
to stop the<i> Enterprise.</i>

692
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:53,041
That means you have to get
control of the train.

693
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,583
DATA:
Understood, sir.

694
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56,542
The ship is looking
for vertion particles.

695
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,542
And it believes that
the Cordannas system

696
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,250
is the closest source--
is there any possibility

697
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,500
of anything closer?

698
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:03,667
White dwarf stars are
the only natural

699
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:05,250
sources of vertion, sir.

700
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:06,917
Then what about
artificial ones?

701
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,625
Can you create
the particles?

702
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,166
How did the conductor
stop the train?

703
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,417
There is a braking lever
in the engine room.

704
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,500
Let's go.

705
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:16,750
Sorry, folks,

706
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:18,959
but you ain't
going nowhere.

707
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,458
LA FORGE:
I've narrowed the search down

708
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,625
to the MacPherson nebula,
which is a supernova remnant,

709
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:30,583
and Dikon Alpha,
which is a class-9 pulsar.

710
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,625
They're both fairly close
to our current flight path,

711
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,500
and either one could
produce vertion particles

712
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:37,458
if we detonated a modified
photon torpedo inside it.

713
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,041
Vertions usually occur
in minuscule amounts.

714
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,333
Do you think either
of these phenomena

715
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,917
could produce
enough of them?

716
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:44,709
It's really hard to say,
I can't even guarantee

717
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,000
that we can
create them at all.

718
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,333
Well, we've got
to give it a try.

719
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,542
The nebula or the pulsar?

720
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:52,333
It's your choice,
Mr. La Forge.

721
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,041
I say go with
the nebula.

722
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:57,041
Very well.
Begin the torpedo modifications.

723
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:58,500
Now let's see if
we can get this ship

724
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:00,500
to go where we want.

725
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,417
Please,
listen to me.

726
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,667
We understand
what's happening.

727
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,792
We know you have to get
to New Vertiform City,

728
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:10,709
and we want to help you
get there.

729
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,583
Well,
I don't know.

730
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,000
Please.

731
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,750
We're your friends.

732
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:18,458
You really gonna help us
get to New Vertiform City?

733
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,125
I promise.

734
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:23,291
Well, okay,
but just one of you.

735
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,000
The rest stay here.

736
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:36,125
That's far enough.

737
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,709
Sorry to spoil
your party, pal.

738
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,959
It's nothing personal.

739
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,333
I can get us there
more quickly.

740
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:41,834
I know
a shorter route.

741
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:44,000
Don't listen to him.
He's up to something.

742
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:45,583
A shorter route?

743
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,917
Yes, if you will let me
handle the controls.

744
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:50,000
Don't do it.

745
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:51,542
Well...

746
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,375
we're already
behind schedule.

747
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:57,333
If you can get us
there on time...

748
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:00,250
all right, go on,
but no funny stuff.

749
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,500
Data to Captain Picard.

750
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:04,834
I have taken control
of the engine room.

751
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,583
Stand by.

752
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:08,333
Are we within sensor
range of the nebula?

753
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,583
Yes, Captain,
we are.

754
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:14,000
Mr. Data, I need you to
slow us to impulse speed.

755
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:15,875
I will attempt
to do so.

756
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,417
I hope you know
what you're doing.

757
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:41,083
Are the modifications
to the torpedoes complete?

758
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,625
Aye, sir.

759
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,208
Launch torpedo.

760
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,834
It's working,
Captain.

761
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,792
The reaction is producing
vertion particles.

762
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,083
Well, what do you know?

763
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,500
We're here!

764
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:08,542
New Vertiform City!

765
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:09,917
(<i> laughing</i> )

766
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:12,583
(<i> whistle blaring</i> )

767
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,792
The nodes are deactivating
all over the ship.

768
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:20,542
All our systems are beginning
to function normally again.

769
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,375
Then the purpose
of the ship's intelligence

770
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:25,250
was simply to bring this
life-form into being.

771
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:28,834
There are some species whose
sole purpose is to reproduce.

772
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:31,667
Once they finally
procreate, they die.

773
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:33,375
Captain...

774
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:07,583
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

775
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,000
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is</i>
<i>back under our control.</i>

776
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,875
<i>All traces of the emergent</i>
<i>intelligence are gone,</i>

777
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:16,667
<i>and the object it created</i>
<i>has disappeared into space.</i>

778
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,250
(<i> door chimes</i> )

779
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,500
Come.

780
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:29,542
Captain, I am staging
a scene from<i> The Tempest</i>

781
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:31,291
this evening for
a small audience.

782
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,667
I would like
for you to attend.

783
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:35,625
I would be honored.
What scene?

784
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:38,417
Miranda's first encounter
with other human beings.

785
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,208
"O brave new world,
that has such people in it."

786
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,750
It seemed appropriate.

787
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,583
Captain, you took
a substantial risk

788
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,667
in allowing
the<i> Enterprise</i> to...

789
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:58,542
complete its task.

790
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,041
Why do you say that?

791
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,792
Because the end result
was unknown.

792
00:43:02,834 --> 00:43:05,166
The object could
have been dangerous.

793
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,208
It may, in fact,
<i>be</i> dangerous.

794
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,458
And I have allowed it
to go off on its merry way.

795
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,792
Yes, sir.

796
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:13,125
The intelligence
that was formed

797
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:14,625
on the<i> Enterprise</i>

798
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:18,208
didn't just come out
of the ship's systems.

799
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,667
It came from us,
from our mission records,

800
00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:23,500
personal logs,
holodeck programs...

801
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:25,125
our fantasies.

802
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:28,041
Now, if our experiences
with the<i> Enterprise</i>

803
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,291
have been honorable,

804
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:33,208
can't we trust that
the sum of those experiences

805
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,208
will be the same?
