1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:06,875
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41798.2.</i>

2
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:08,792
<i>We have been ordered</i>
<i>by Starfleet</i>

3
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:10,792
<i>to proceed</i>
<i>to the Lorenze Cluster</i>

4
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:12,750
<i>and investigate</i>
<i>the disappearance</i>

5
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:14,959
<i>of the light cruiser</i>
<i>U.S.S.</i> Drake--

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,417
<i>which was in that system</i>

7
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,834
<i>trying to unravel</i>
<i>a mystery of its own</i>

8
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,291
<i>which began when recent</i>
<i>long-range probes</i>

9
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,625
<i>indicated that all intelligent</i>
<i>life on the planet Minos</i>

10
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,834
<i>had disappeared.</i>

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,709
Number One?

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,750
No help from
the communications log, sir.

13
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,667
The<i> Drake</i> reported
arriving at Minos

14
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:35,208
and then wasn't
heard from again.

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,417
Mr. Data?

16
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,333
The citizens of
Minos gained fame

17
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,750
during the Esalrope Wars
as arms merchants.

18
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,375
They manufactured
sophisticated

19
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:44,917
and highly-advanced weaponry.

20
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:46,750
Yeah, for which side?

21
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:48,417
Both.

22
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,959
We are approaching
the planet Minos, sir.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,917
Standard orbit, Mr. La Forge.

24
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,709
Aye, sir, standard orbit.

25
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,583
Whatever happened to the<i> Drake</i>
happened quickly.

26
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,709
Otherwise a man like Rice
would have reported again.

27
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,917
You know
Captain Rice?

28
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,792
We were
at the academy together.

29
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:05,875
Tell me about him.

30
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,000
Able, good officer.

31
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,333
How would he react
under stress?

32
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,834
Paul Rice is confident
to the point of arrogance

33
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,458
but he carries it well
because he's usually right.

34
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,583
He's a risk taker.

35
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,542
Really?
I'll give you an example.

36
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,083
One of the final tests
in Advanced Navigation

37
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,709
at the Academy provides
the students with three options.

38
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,208
Rice was given this test

39
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,542
rejected their options,
and offered one of his own.

40
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,125
That's taking a risk.

41
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,125
And it paid off.

42
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,333
He received the top grade

43
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,125
and now that same test
has four options.

44
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,500
In a difficult situation

45
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:36,834
a man like that would
act aggressively.

46
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:37,709
Agreed.

47
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,917
WORF:
Commander.

48
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,333
Weren't you offered
the<i> Drake?</i>

49
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,875
Yes.

50
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:44,375
You gave up your own command
to take this assignment?

51
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:46,959
At the time I thought
it would be more advantageous

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,917
to do a tour
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

53
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,458
DATA:
Captain

54
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,583
readings correspond
with the findings of the probe.

55
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:53,959
No signs
of intelligent life-forms.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,500
Vegetation and
animal life only.

57
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,959
What happened
to all the people?

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,458
War?

59
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,875
Disease?

60
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,875
A dissatisfied customer?

61
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:07,834
In every war, natural disaster,
even the most virulent plague

62
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,750
there are always survivors.

63
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,875
(<i> beeping</i> )

64
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,750
Captain, we are being hailed.

65
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,375
How can that be, from
a planet with no people?

66
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:18,417
Your sensors indicated
no intelligent life-forms?

67
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,750
Correct, sir.

68
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,542
Something has scanned
our language banks

69
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,125
and is hailing us.

70
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,250
On main viewer.

71
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,667
(<i> beeping</i> )

72
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,375
Whoever you are,
wherever you're from...

73
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,875
greetings.

74
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:36,208
Welcome to Minos--
the arsenal of freedom.

75
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,250
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the<i> U.S.S....</i>

76
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,875
If you need
a little something...

77
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:44,291
special, be it for one target
or multiple targets

78
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,333
we got it.

79
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,333
You'll see it, here on Minos--

80
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,917
where we live by the motto

81
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,417
"peace through superior
firepower."

82
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,875
To whom am I speaking?

83
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:58,125
To be totally armed
is to be totally secure.

84
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:03,125
Remember, the early bird
that hesitates gets wormed.

85
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,083
It is a recorded
message, sir.

86
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,083
Minos--

87
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,792
the arsenal of freedom.

88
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:10,959
Perfection in highly advanced
weaponry.

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,333
Versatility, flexibility...

90
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,875
We must have triggered
something

91
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:15,208
left over
from the Erselrope Wars

92
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,834
when the arms business
was booming.

93
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,083
...guaranteed.

94
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,333
So lock onto my signal,
and beam on down

95
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,000
because we don't just
provide weapons.

96
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:24,959
Shut that off.

97
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We provide

98
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,166
complete weapons syst...

99
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,417
That's a heck
of a sales pitch.

100
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,000
If an automatic message system
is still functioning

101
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,000
there could be other systems
on that planet

102
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,125
that are still operational.

103
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,583
Weapons systems?
Possibly.

104
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,125
We're going to have
to go down there to find it.

105
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,000
Number One,
prepare an away team.

106
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,750
Lieutenant Yar,
Data.

107
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:45,583
Commander, I recommend
a minimum complement.

108
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,041
Oh? I would have
thought otherwise.

109
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,792
We'll keep the first
landing party small

110
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:51,500
and mobile until I'm confident

111
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:52,875
whatever killed the inhabitants
of this planet

112
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:53,917
isn't still down there.

113
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,125
Okay.

114
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:27,125
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

115
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:31,250
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

116
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

117
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,542
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

118
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:41,542
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

119
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:47,458
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

120
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,250
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

121
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,250
<i>I've ordered an away team</i>
<i>to beam down to Minos</i>

122
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,041
<i>to investigate</i>
<i>the disappearance of the</i> Drake.

123
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,041
<i>Although there are no signs</i>
<i>of intelligent life</i>

124
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,500
<i>coming from this</i>
<i>heavily forested planet</i>

125
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:05,750
<i>I'm far from certain</i>
<i>that it is devoid of danger.</i>

126
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,417
(<i> beeping</i> )

127
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,750
(<i> bird chirping</i> )

128
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,291
Spooky.

129
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,500
Riker.

130
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:21,917
This is the Bridge.

131
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,500
We'll start a patterned search
from this point.

132
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,250
Keep this channel open.

133
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,709
Aye, sir.

134
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,417
Commander, our communications
are being monitored.

135
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,125
By whom?

136
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:37,083
Since there is no intelligent
life, the question is by what?

137
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,208
Captain?

138
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,375
Yes, we heard that,
Number One.

139
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:43,000
We'll try and track it down
from here.

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,583
YAR:
Tritanium.

141
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,583
It's melted.

142
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,792
What could do that?

143
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,583
I don't know, but
whatever it was

144
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,000
it's beyond
our technology.

145
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,667
Over here.

146
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,583
Wow.

147
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,792
We've never seen
anything like this.

148
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:27,834
It's undamaged.

149
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,375
Maybe a
demonstration model

150
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,083
for some
potential buyer.

151
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,792
Maybe.

152
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's spread out
a little.

153
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,291
Commander Riker.

154
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,959
This is Ensign T'su.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,709
I am monitoring a slight energy
buildup near your position.

156
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,792
I'm not able to pinpoint
the source.

157
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,291
Give me a direction.

158
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,375
East of your position,
ten meters.

159
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,834
I will continue monitoring.

160
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,166
I can't see anything
through here.

161
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,875
The underbrush is too thick.

162
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,083
Hello.

163
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,166
Commander Riker.

164
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,709
Rice.

165
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,041
Where did you
come from?

166
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,458
I was over there.

167
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,834
We were worried
about you.

168
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,291
I should have known
you'd pop up.

169
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,709
How are you,
Commander Riker?

170
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,667
Me? Forget about me.

171
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:23,834
What about you?

172
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,792
No word, no message,
nothing.

173
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:28,542
How many are with you?
There are two others.

174
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,041
Where's the<i> Drake?</i> 
Where's your crew?

175
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,417
PICARD:
Number One, a word.

176
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:37,458
We have some information
you should be aware of.

177
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,792
Ensign T'su?

178
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:41,792
Sensors indicate
low-level energy readings

179
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:44,834
but the only life signs
are the away team.

180
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,500
Do you copy,
Number One?

181
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,041
Understood.

182
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,083
You look strange, Paul.

183
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:01,458
I was injured getting here.

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,583
Do you need
medical help?

185
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,583
No.

186
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,375
What's your purpose here?

187
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:12,291
Commander Data,
Lieutenant Yar.

188
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,750
Sir, other
than ourselves

189
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:18,000
I am picking up
no life signs here.

190
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,041
I know.

191
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,750
Riker, you didn't answer me.

192
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,667
Who sent you here
to look for me?

193
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:24,709
Your mother.

194
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,291
She's worried about you.

195
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,834
Tell me about your ship, Riker.

196
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,625
It's the<i> Enterprise,</i>
isn't it?

197
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:36,750
No, the name of my ship
is the<i> Lollipop.</i>

198
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:39,542
I have no knowledge
of that ship.

199
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,083
It's just been commissioned.
It's a good ship.

200
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,208
Refresh me, would you, Riker?

201
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,625
What's its size,
its complement?

202
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,792
Who is here with you?

203
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:51,250
What's the armament
on the<i> Lollipop?</i>

204
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,166
Paul, I will only answer
your questions

205
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,792
if you answer mine.

206
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:58,208
Why do you want to know
so much about my ship?

207
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,458
We're friends, aren't we?

208
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Old friends.

209
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:06,125
Our top speed is warp 3,
what's yours?

210
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,458
"Is"?

211
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,166
Then the<i> Drake</i> has not
been destroyed.

212
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,917
The<i> Drake?</i>

213
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,542
Yes, your ship.

214
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,083
Of course.
My ship is the<i> Drake.</i>

215
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,250
Where is it?

216
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,458
Classified.

217
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,667
Classified?

218
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:21,667
Please.

219
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:22,875
It's important.

220
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,667
Our survival depends on knowing.

221
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,875
What's the armament
on your ship?

222
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,041
Ten.
Ten?

223
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,792
I don't understand.
Ten what?

224
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:33,000
Six.

225
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,166
Commander Riker,
your answers make no sense.

226
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,667
You haven't used
my first name once, Paul.

227
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:40,333
You remember it, don't you?

228
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,583
You don't, do you?

229
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,417
Because you don't exist.

230
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,792
You're a fake.

231
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,500
You're an image of the original,
aren't you?

232
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:50,750
Answer me!

233
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,083
PICARD:
Report, Number One.

234
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,208
The image of Rice
has been replaced

235
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,834
by something
which is hovering

236
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,250
several meters away.

237
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,250
Number One,
get your team back up here.

238
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,417
Prepare
to beam up.

239
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,458
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

240
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,625
Commander!

241
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,083
What's happened, Number One?

242
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,083
Report.

243
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,125
Report, report!

244
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,583
He can't answer you,
Captain.

245
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,333
Commander Riker
has just been encased

246
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,792
in some kind of
energy field.

247
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,959
Is he alive?

248
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,834
Unknown.

249
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,583
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

250
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,750
<i>Some kind of weapon</i>

251
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:48,291
<i>which, for a time, took</i>
<i>the form of Captain Paul Rice</i>

252
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,959
<i>has enveloped Commander Riker.</i>

253
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,417
Transporter Room 3.

254
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,625
Have you been able to lock on
to the away team?

255
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,834
MAN:
I am unable to lock on
to Commander Riker, sir.

256
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,375
Ensign T'su,
situation report.

257
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,083
Previous energy
readings are gone.

258
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,583
Data, have you been able
to assess

259
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,625
Commander Riker's condition?

260
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,250
DATA:
He appears to be
in some kind of stasis.

261
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,750
Theorize, Mr. Data.

262
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:12,083
What would be the purpose
of such an encasement?

263
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,291
Typically, the purpose
of such an enclosure

264
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,125
is for storage.

265
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,041
PICARD:
Which would suggest what?

266
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,583
That sooner or later

267
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,792
someone or something
will be along to collect him.

268
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,208
Stand by.
I'm coming down.

269
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,375
You, sir?

270
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:26,208
Yes. Dr. Crusher,
this is the Captain.

271
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,959
Meet me in
Transporter Room 3.

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,083
Mr. La Forge,
you have command of the Bridge.

273
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,208
Aye, sir.

274
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,709
And whatever
happens down there

275
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,250
your prime
responsibility
is to the ship.

276
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,792
Understood, sir.

277
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:38,834
Captain, I take exception
to your decision to beam down.

278
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,458
Noted.

279
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,792
Is it just Riker?

280
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,750
Yes. Apparently
he's been confined

281
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,583
inside some sort
of force field.

282
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,000
Energize.

283
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,709
Any changes?

284
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,166
Data's figured
out what it is.

285
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,041
Are you getting
any life signs?

286
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,417
He is alive.

287
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,917
What appeared
in the form of
Captain Rice

288
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,291
is an intelligence-
gathering device

289
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,834
used during the
Erselrope Wars.

290
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,709
Probably developed here.

291
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,000
DATA:
It projects an image

292
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,834
of someone the
subject will trust.

293
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,583
Gets as much information
as possible.

294
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,792
If it's found out,
it encases the subject

295
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:27,792
to await a more detailed
interrogation later.

296
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:29,041
Clever.

297
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,166
Can you remove it?
DATA: Possibly.

298
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,542
But I will need to know
the exact frequency

299
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,250
and I cannot
determine the risk

300
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,208
to Commander Riker.

301
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

302
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,041
We have little choice.

303
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,583
Whatever has him is interrupting
the transporter beam. Remove it.

304
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,250
(<i> high-pitched beeping</i> )

305
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,250
This will take some time, sir.

306
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,959
(<i> electronic tones</i> )

307
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,500
I am picking up
energy readings.

308
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:58,917
(<i> beep</i> )

309
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,125
Captain,
Lieutenant La Forge here.

310
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,166
Sensors indicate energy readings
in your area.

311
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,625
Doctor,
over here!

312
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,667
(<i> gasping</i> ):
Oh, no...

313
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:25,583
Doctor!

314
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,166
(<i> both yell</i> )

315
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,625
(<i> moans softly</i> )

316
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,875
(<i> Picard coughing</i> )

317
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,083
Doctor!

318
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,583
(<i> gasping</i> )

319
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,166
This one is different.

320
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,959
It's anticipating.

321
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,375
Data, I need you.

322
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,875
Set your phaser on kill.

323
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,166
I'll lead left,
you get it.

324
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,000
Captain!

325
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,375
Dr. Crusher?

326
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:39,959
Captain Picard.

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,125
I have a malfunction.

328
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,792
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is Yar.

329
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:43,917
Mine's out, too.

330
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,041
The close pass
by the weapons

331
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,458
must have disrupted
our communicators.

332
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,709
Keep on working.

333
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,166
I'll look for the Captain
and Dr. Crusher.

334
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,125
Ow, my arm!

335
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,709
How bad is it?

336
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,792
(<i> groans</i> )

337
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,291
It's bad.

338
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,041
(<i> panting</i> )

339
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,041
Hey, come on.

340
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,250
Come on.

341
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:14,083
All right, d-don't worry.

342
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,166
We'll get you out of here.

343
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,875
<i>Enterprise,</i>
this is the Captain.

344
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,375
Two to beam up.

345
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:20,625
Oh...<i> </i>
<i>Enterprise!</i>

346
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,250
<i>Enterprise,</i> come in.

347
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,667
Data, Lieutenant Yar.

348
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:28,792
What's wrong?

349
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,166
Why aren't
they working?

350
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,166
I don't know.

351
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,166
But don't worry.

352
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,959
As soon as they realize

353
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,500
that our communicators
are not working

354
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:39,667
th-their sensors will find us,
and Geordi will beam us up.

355
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,083
Now, just you hold on.

356
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,125
Uh...

357
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,625
I'm, uh, sorry about this.

358
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:47,834
(<i> cloth ripping</i> )

359
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,166
Hold on.

360
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,917
It won't be long.

361
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:05,542
I must keep conscious.

362
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,375
YAR:
Data?

363
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,792
I can't find them.

364
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,083
Step back, please.

365
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,041
I believe I have found it.

366
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,667
Data.

367
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,375
All vital signs
returning to normal.

368
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,500
Good.

369
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,542
Now Geordi can get us
out of here.

370
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,792
Come on.

371
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:37,375
The Captain
and Dr. Crusher

372
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:39,291
can't be far away.

373
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,583
(<i> beeping</i> )

374
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,041
Sir, I'm reading
life-forms on
the planet.

375
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,542
All five members
of the away team.

376
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,625
Good. They must have freed
Commander Riker.

377
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,041
Transporter Room

378
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,709
get a lock on the away team,
and beam them up.

379
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,083
Shields just came on.

380
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,792
Deflectors also up.

381
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:57,750
I'm picking up an object
off the port bow.

382
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:58,917
It's firing.

383
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,709
Red alert.
Battle stations.

384
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,083
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

385
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,917
We can't beam the away team up
with our shields in place.

386
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,750
WORF:
Phasers ready.

387
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,333
Photon torpedoes standing by.

388
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,166
Locking on target.

389
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,333
Correction...

390
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,166
target has disappeared.

391
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,208
Give me a full scan.

392
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,375
Scanning.

393
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,000
No readings yet.

394
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,375
Wait. Something dead astern.

395
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,041
Emergency power to shields.

396
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,250
Object is firing.

397
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,417
Return fire.

398
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,000
No use.
It's gone again.

399
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,458
Aft shields weakened.

400
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,834
Whatever they're using

401
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,000
our shields can't stand up to it
much longer.

402
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,375
This is Chief Engineer Logan.

403
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:43,750
Are we breaking orbit?
I need to know, now!

404
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,875
LA FORGE:
<i>Ship's Log, supplemental.</i>

405
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,417
<i>Lieutenant La Forge in command.</i>

406
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,417
<i>I am unable to beam up</i>
<i>the away team</i>

407
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,208
<i>due to an unseen assailant</i>
<i>attacking the ship.</i>

408
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,792
<i>To make matters worse</i>

409
00:18:57,834 --> 00:19:00,375
<i>Chief Engineer Logan is</i>
<i>on his way to the Bridge</i>

410
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,500
<i>and he's not paying</i>
<i>a courtesy call.</i>

411
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,542
Why are we
still in orbit?

412
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,917
We're taking
a beating.

413
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,709
We've<i> got</i> to hold out
as long as we can.

414
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,375
Now, if can disable
our attacker

415
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,875
if only for a few seconds,
we can drop our shields

416
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,542
and beam the away team
back aboard.

417
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,959
If we follow that plan,
we'll lose the<i> Enterprise.</i>

418
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,208
In view of the
present crisis

419
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,542
I believe you should
relinquish command to me.

420
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,542
No.

421
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,834
I outrank you.

422
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,834
Mr. Logan, I'm in command.

423
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,375
The Captain did not anticipate

424
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,542
the<i> Enterprise</i>
would come under attack.

425
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,417
If he had, would he have
left the Bridge to you?

426
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,667
If he had,
he wouldn't have left the<i> ship!</i>

427
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,500
Picking up an object
to starboard, sir

428
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,500
heading toward us.

429
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:40,667
Lock phasers
on that thing

430
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:42,250
and fire the moment
it's in range.

431
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,458
Locking in.

432
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,875
The object has vanished.

433
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,291
Phaser lock lost.

434
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,166
Starboard shields weakened.

435
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,458
It's cloaked itself.

436
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,333
You can't fight this thing
and win.

437
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,917
We've got to break orbit, now!

438
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,583
Worf...

439
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,333
analyze its firing pattern.

440
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,667
Maybe we can anticipate
its location.

441
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,709
Aye.

442
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,000
Solis...

443
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,917
correlate the trajectory
of the energy bolts

444
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,250
with the attack path.

445
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,166
I'll compute
the optimum spread of phaser

446
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,542
and photon torpedoes to hit it.

447
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,625
Right!

448
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,709
Lieutenant
La Forge...

449
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,083
Geordi...

450
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,792
I know you want to do what's
best for the<i> Enterprise.</i>

451
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,333
So do I.
Now, the best thing...

452
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,375
The best thing, Mr. Logan,
is for this discussion to end

453
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,291
and for you to return
to your duties.

454
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,000
Now, I'm in charge
until relieved

455
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,875
by Commander Riker
or Captain Picard.

456
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:40,333
You're ignoring
my greater rank
and experience.

457
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,000
Not at all.

458
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,250
In fact, just the opposite.

459
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,667
I'm counting on it.

460
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,458
Now, I need you to get
back down to Engineering

461
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,917
and get me every
available scrap

462
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,333
of emergency power you can.

463
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,959
The more power we can
channel to the shields

464
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,417
the longer we'll be able
to hold out.

465
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,458
<i>Now,</i> Mr. Logan.

466
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

467
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,500
Worf, have you got
a lock on it yet?

468
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:14,375
It's impossible
to be sure.

469
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,709
Maybe you should wait here

470
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,834
while Data and I search
for the Captain and Dr. Crusher.

471
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,208
Nah, I'm a
little groggy

472
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,333
but I'll be
all right.

473
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,083
I am getting
energy readings...

474
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,709
Look out!

475
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:44,041
We'll do it
just like before.

476
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,875
It's got a deflector shield.

477
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:59,709
The product continues
to upgrade and improve.

478
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,375
We'll concentrate our fire
and try to collapse its shield.

479
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:05,125
Commander,
we'll need you, too.

480
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:09,959
Now!

481
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,834
You're right.
They keep on getting better.

482
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,375
The weapons
are appearing

483
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:30,000
at intervals of
precisely 12 minutes.

484
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,417
Well, this one took
everything we had.

485
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,208
I don't know how
we'll handle the next one.

486
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,792
We're not going
to wait around.

487
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,542
Let's find
the rest of our team.

488
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,959
(<i> water dripping</i> )

489
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,208
We seem to be in some kind
of underground structure.

490
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,709
but I don't see any...

491
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,458
Hey.

492
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,750
No, you don't.

493
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,333
No time to sleep.

494
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:02,291
I'm tired.

495
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,417
Come on,
stay with me.

496
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,125
Come on, now,
stay awake.

497
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,542
That's an order.

498
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,375
I must have lost
a lot of blood.

499
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,291
I stopped the bleeding.

500
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:16,291
No, there's
another wound.

501
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,709
My leg.

502
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,291
(<i> cry of pain</i> )

503
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:27,500
Ah, not to worry.

504
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:30,792
Everything's going
to be fine.

505
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:34,458
Now... this is going
to hurt a bit.

506
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,792
I've heard that before.

507
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,125
(<i> moaning</i> )

508
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:48,583
Hey, hey, Doctor,
stay awake, come on.

509
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:49,667
There's a lot of blood.

510
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:50,750
What do I do next?

511
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,458
Doctor.

512
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,625
Uh... the wound needs
a clotting agent.

513
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,792
I couldn't find
your medical kit.

514
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,333
Those roots... what are they?

515
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,333
Roots?

516
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,291
What, these?

517
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,208
Break off a piece
and taste it.

518
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,750
Don't swallow it.

519
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,709
Very bitter.

520
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,583
Apply some to your hand.

521
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:30,625
Is there
a color change?

522
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,583
It's-It's turning yellowish.

523
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:38,208
Good. Now, spread as much of it
as you can onto the wound.

524
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,417
Hey, hey, Doctor!

525
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,542
Now, stay awake.

526
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,834
(<i> pounding root</i> )

527
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,417
You've got
to help me.

528
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:55,000
I need your help.

529
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,709
All right, now listen.

530
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,333
Your patient

531
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:05,583
has lost a great deal of blood
from multiple lacerations.

532
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,583
The patient's going into shock.

533
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,667
So what do I do?

534
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:16,667
Elevate the legs,
and try to keep her warm.

535
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,166
Good.

536
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,917
All right?

537
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,208
(<i> groans in pain</i> )

538
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,333
Stay with me, Doctor.

539
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,083
Keep talking.

540
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:36,166
Well... you didn't happen

541
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:37,834
to bring a blanket
with you, did you?

542
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:40,208
No.

543
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,291
I'm going to look
for a way out.

544
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,834
Now, you keep up your end.

545
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,375
Stay awake.

546
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,291
LA FORGE:
All right

547
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,542
I know it's risky

548
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:14,417
but a shot in the dark
is better than nothing.

549
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:17,750
Let's see
if we can get lucky.

550
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:21,709
I can't seem
to pin down
the pattern.

551
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:23,959
(<i> beeping</i> )

552
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,917
There.

553
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:25,917
Sorry, sir.

554
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,000
I should have
seen that.

555
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,000
No, that's all right.

556
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,000
You're doing fine.

557
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,208
WORF:
Program laid in.

558
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,250
Phasers and photon torpedoes
ready.

559
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,750
Okay.

560
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:40,542
Mr. Solis, bring her about
to 23, mark 185.

561
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,875
Aye, sir.

562
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,417
Fire!

563
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:50,583
Now!

564
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:51,959
Phasers and photons firing.

565
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:59,959
We<i> missed!</i>

566
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,375
Number 4 shield
buckling.

567
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,166
Number 3 shield nearing failure.

568
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,834
LOGAN:
Bridge, this is Engineering.

569
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,917
I can't hold this power level
much longer.

570
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,542
You've got to<i> do</i> something!

571
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,500
Backup systems
are overloaded.

572
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,458
Backup systems failing!

573
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,917
LOGAN:
La Forge!

574
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,959
This is Logan.

575
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,417
Tell me something.

576
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:27,458
Mr. Logan, report to the Bridge.

577
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,291
On my way.

578
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,041
Deflectors are
breaking down.

579
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,083
We have less than
one minute of reserve.

580
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,583
We're getting
out of here.

581
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:58,125
Lieutenant Solis,
set course 315,
mark 007.

582
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:00,125
Course set.

583
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,583
You are leaving them
on the planet.

584
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:02,875
Speed, warp 5.

585
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:05,166
Warp 5. Aye.

586
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,208
Engage.

587
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:32,166
Hold course and speed
for 28 seconds

588
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,583
then come to a full stop.

589
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,917
Mr. Logan...

590
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:39,250
had we stayed,
we would have been destroyed

591
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:41,000
and there are over
a thousand people on this ship.

592
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,583
I have a responsibility
to them.

593
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,041
What about your
responsibility

594
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,125
to Captain Picard
and the members

595
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,417
of the away team?

596
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,875
I have a responsibility
to them, as well.

597
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:53,834
Mr. Logan, you are going
to take command...

598
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:57,083
...of the Saucer Section.

599
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:59,917
Back up crew,
report to the Main Bridge.

600
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,250
We're going to separate?

601
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,125
Yes, and I want you
to take the Saucer Section

602
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,875
and proceed immediately
to Starbase 103.

603
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,166
You can't fight
what you can't see.

604
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,500
And you still won't be
able to see that thing.

605
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:10,834
Maybe we won't have to.

606
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,041
Risky.

607
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,166
Yes. That's why
we're going to separate.

608
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,333
Worf, Solis, T'su...

609
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,834
report to the Battle Bridge.

610
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,125
I'll join you in a moment.

611
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,834
WORF:
Ensign, secure
connector levels.

612
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:24,083
MAN:
Aye, sir.

613
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,208
(<i> door chimes</i> )

614
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,583
Come in.

615
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:55,250
Lieutenant, I need
to speak to you.

616
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,750
Counselor,
we're a few minutes away

617
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,333
from separating
the battle section.

618
00:29:58,375 --> 00:29:59,333
I don't have a lot of time.

619
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:01,125
I know,
but as counselor

620
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,041
I have a duty
to evaluate

621
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,500
the emotional
fitness of the crew.

622
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:10,000
And you sense I'm nervous?

623
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,417
Well, you're right.

624
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:15,333
Counselor, deep down,
I'm shaking.

625
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,166
I'm about to take
this ship into battle

626
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,500
and-and there's a good chance

627
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,250
she'll be blasted
out of the sky.

628
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,917
I'm taking
a huge risk here

629
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:24,291
and there are
a lot of lives at stake.

630
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:27,291
So, yeah, I'm nervous.

631
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,792
Did you expect otherwise?

632
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:29,917
Not at all.

633
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,500
You're under
tremendous pressure

634
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:33,291
more than you've
ever experienced.

635
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,083
And you think
I'm about to crack?

636
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,250
On the contrary,
you should be proud

637
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,166
of the way
you're handling command.

638
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:42,333
You've kept a cool
head, taken charge

639
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,792
and made some very
difficult decisions.

640
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:46,291
Then what did you want
to see me about?

641
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,083
SOLIS:
Lieutenant La Forge

642
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,375
Battle Bridge
is manned and ready.

643
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:53,542
However, deflectors have not yet
returned to full efficiency.

644
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:56,208
Let's get them there,
Mr. Solis.

645
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,417
Aye, sir.

646
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,542
I'll join you shortly.

647
00:30:58,583 --> 00:30:59,959
La Forge out.

648
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,583
Did you hear the
uneasiness in his voice?

649
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,792
Solis is doing a fine job.

650
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,458
Yes, but he isn't
handling the stress

651
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,792
as well as you are.

652
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,750
Both he and Ensign T'su
are very young.

653
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:12,583
No, wait.
They're good officers.

654
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:15,125
Yes, but they lack
battle experience.

655
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,291
They're worried
about making mistakes

656
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,417
and they need
some encouragement.

657
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:21,917
What do I do?

658
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:26,583
Just remember, it's<i> you</i>
they draw strength from.

659
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:30,250
They look to you
for guidance and
for leadership.

660
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,625
Help them.

661
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:38,625
Show confidence in them.

662
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:42,709
Like Captain Picard
showed confidence in me.

663
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,875
Right.

664
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,333
(<i> sighing</i> )

665
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:46,458
I understand.

666
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,375
Thanks, Counselor.

667
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,208
Prepare to initiate
separation sequence.

668
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,333
All decks
report ready.

669
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,125
On my mark.

670
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,375
Now.

671
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:33,458
COMPUTER:
Main-latch mags to zero.

672
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,917
Main-latch retraction, 1 to 18.

673
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:37,959
Initiate.

674
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Static charge, compensated.

675
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,625
Separation complete.

676
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:50,917
Lieutenant Solis

677
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:54,500
lay in a reciprocal course
for Minos, warp 5.

678
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:55,583
Course set.

679
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:58,166
On my mark.

680
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:00,250
Engage.

681
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:16,166
We seem to be pretty well
sealed in, Doctor.

682
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:18,083
No exits?

683
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,834
None that
I can see.

684
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:22,917
If you find one, go.

685
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:27,000
Uh-huh, tired
of my company already?

686
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,208
Beverly?

687
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,792
Beverly?!

688
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:34,291
I'm tired.
I need to sleep.

689
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,792
Woke up too early.

690
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:37,917
Talk to me.
Stay awake.

691
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,834
Tell me something.

692
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:42,041
Tell me about, uh...
about those roots.

693
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,834
How did you know
their medicinal values?

694
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,417
My grandmother.

695
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,709
Your grandmother was a doctor?

696
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,291
No.

697
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,000
Oh, she was a
botanist then?

698
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:54,959
Uh... no.

699
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
She helped to colonize
Arvada III.

700
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:01,458
Arvada III?

701
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,583
That's such a tragedy.
Did she survive?

702
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,250
Yes.

703
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:10,792
Once the medical supplies
had run out

704
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:13,709
she had to use what was at hand.

705
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,417
So she learned
all about roots and herbs

706
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:20,083
and then
taught it to me.

707
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:23,125
You were part of that colony.
I didn't know that.

708
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:26,250
But then there must be
a lot of things about you

709
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,291
that I don't know.

710
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:30,417
Quite a few.

711
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:31,792
What?

712
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:35,166
Now, just a minute,
here's something odd.

713
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,333
It's glowing.

714
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,291
What is it?

715
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,750
I don't know.

716
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:41,250
It's... it's covered up.

717
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:45,125
Just... just clearing away
the dirt.

718
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,166
It's a viewscreen.

719
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:56,333
It seems to
still be
operative.

720
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:04,291
(<i> buzzing, beeps</i> )

721
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:08,291
(<i> startup whirring</i> )

722
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,834
(<i> electronic humming</i> )

723
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,250
It's a tracking device
of some kind.

724
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,125
Tracking what?

725
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:17,208
There are three
moving indicators.

726
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,208
Possibly the away team.

727
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,959
Beautiful, isn't it?

728
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,625
It's the centerpiece
of the whole unit.

729
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:30,667
Who's that?

730
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,542
A projection.

731
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,083
It's the automated
salesman

732
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:38,250
who greeted us
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

733
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,458
What unit?

734
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,750
Why, the Echo Papa 607--

735
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:43,875
our proudest achievement.

736
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:46,959
The ultimate
in weapons system technology.

737
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,166
Is that what's behind
the attack on my people?

738
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:53,125
Impressive demonstration,
isn't it?

739
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:55,709
Demonstration?
It tried to kill us.

740
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,458
Versatile, powerful,
and easy to use.

741
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,083
The 607
does it all.

742
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,333
Its various modules

743
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:06,250
can gather information,
neutralize ground personnel

744
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,083
even destroy
enemy space vessels.

745
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,291
The<i> Enterprise.</i>

746
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,583
Is one of those things
after my ship?

747
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:15,792
Tell me.

748
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:17,166
Of course I can tell you.

749
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,959
I am programmed to answer
any and all questions

750
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,166
about the unit.

751
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:23,458
I can talk terms,
arrange for delivery--

752
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,166
whatever you need.

753
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:29,083
It doesn't understand anything
other than what it's peddling.

754
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,834
The 607 represents
the state of the art

755
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,917
in dynamic adaptive design.

756
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:37,834
It learns from each encounter
and improves itself.

757
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:40,083
So what went wrong?
Where are its creators?

758
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,667
Where are the people of Minos?

759
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:44,875
Once unleashed,
the unit is invincible.

760
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:47,291
The perfect killing system.

761
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:50,875
Too perfect.

762
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:54,917
You poor fools,
your own creation destroyed you.

763
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,750
(<i> electronic whooshing</i> )

764
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:58,333
What was that noise?

765
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:01,000
The unit has analyzed
its last attack

766
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:03,834
and constructed
a new, stronger...

767
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:05,291
deadlier weapon.

768
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,583
In a moment,
it will launch that weapon

769
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,291
against the targets
on the surface.

770
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,667
Abort it!

771
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:13,291
Why would I want to do that?

772
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,917
It can't demonstrate
its abilities

773
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:19,083
unless we let it
leave the nest.

774
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,959
They are down there, sir.

775
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,583
Let's clear
some of that away.

776
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,250
If Data's
calculations
are correct

777
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,125
the next one
should show itself

778
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:30,166
in two minutes.

779
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,417
Captain!

780
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:34,709
Can you hear me?

781
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,583
Yes, we're here!

782
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,250
Are you all right?

783
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,834
Dr. Crusher is seriously hurt.

784
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,875
We can't contact
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

785
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:45,458
The communicators are out.

786
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Yes, our communicators
are out, too.

787
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:48,792
Those devices

788
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,083
are part of a system
located down here.

789
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,583
Another one is about
to be released.
Watch yourself!

790
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,125
We know, Captain.

791
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:56,291
It's too far down there.

792
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,542
There's nothing
to hold on to.

793
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:58,834
There's no way
to climb down.

794
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,458
I'm surprised either
of them survived.

795
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
I can do it,
Commander.

796
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:02,625
How?

797
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:04,667
Jump.

798
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:07,083
Data, it's over ten meters.

799
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,000
11.75, sir.

800
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:10,500
Data...

801
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:12,959
you may be sturdy,
but you're not indestructible.

802
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,333
I believe I can safely
traverse the distance.

803
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:19,458
Captain, Data is going

804
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,750
to join you down there.

805
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,083
Be my guest.

806
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,041
Data.

807
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,083
At your service, Captain.

808
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
We'd better find
a defensive position.

809
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:46,625
If Data's right...

810
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,125
He usually is.

811
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,458
We're going to have company
any minute now

812
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,542
and this time, I don't know
how we're going to stop it.

813
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,417
LA FORGE:
<i>Ship's Log, supplemental.</i>

814
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,792
<i>Lieutenant La Forge in command</i>
<i>of the stardrive section.</i>

815
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:02,750
<i>After separating</i>
<i>from the saucer</i>

816
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:05,750
<i>we have returned to Minos</i>
<i>to rescue the away team.</i>

817
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:09,291
<i>Unfortunately, I have</i>
<i>only one option left</i>

818
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:11,083
<i>and it's a long shot.</i>

819
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:14,125
Shields and
deflectors are up.

820
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,750
Ensign T'su,
when I order the shields down

821
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,166
you have one responsibility:

822
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:20,917
locate the away team,
and get them up here.

823
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,792
You may only have a few seconds.

824
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:24,750
Approaching
the planet, sir.

825
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:27,250
Ride's going to get
a little bumpy.

826
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,667
Things are going to happen fast.

827
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:32,875
Just keep alert,
stay calm.

828
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,625
Let's focus on what we're doing.

829
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,959
You know your jobs.

830
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,375
You've been trained,
you've been tested...

831
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:42,166
and you've earned the right
to sit in those chairs.

832
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,709
(<i> rhythmic beeping</i> )

833
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:50,875
(<i> electronic whooshing</i> )

834
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,792
That sound again.

835
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:54,417
Another weapon has
been launched, sir.

836
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,375
We've got to find some way
to stop the system.

837
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:58,417
I would need to see
the program's schematic.

838
00:39:58,458 --> 00:39:59,583
You've got it.

839
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,083
(<i> beeping whine</i> )

840
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:03,125
Is it possible
to readjust

841
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,166
the targeting
sequence?

842
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:06,375
Absolutely.

843
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,166
It wouldn't be much good
without it.

844
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,500
Data, assign it
a neutral target.

845
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:10,917
Target must be
specific, sir.

846
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,667
Itself, then. Itself
or its own power source.

847
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:13,792
The force of
that explosion

848
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:14,959
would destroy
this cavern

849
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,208
and everyone
on the surface.

850
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,542
Watch now.

851
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:21,583
This is the fourth
and final projectile.

852
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:24,458
The Echo Papa Series 607

853
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,083
is about to complete
this phase of its mission.

854
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,083
We could split up.

855
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:30,125
What good would that do?

856
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:31,542
Confuse it, delay it,
something.

857
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:32,792
It would still get us.

858
00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:34,291
It would just take
a little longer.

859
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,125
It might give one of us time
to get out of range.

860
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,083
Out of range?

861
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

862
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,667
Forget I said it.

863
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:41,250
These devices wiped out
an entire planet.

864
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,417
I don't think
it has a range.

865
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:43,875
Then what does
that leave us?

866
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:46,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

867
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,041
Right. That's
what I thought.

868
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,125
On the other hand,
we could look

869
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,250
for different cover!

870
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:59,333
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

871
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,291
You got any ideas?

872
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,959
None.

873
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:08,250
Give me some options,
Data, quickly.

874
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,166
Why don't you just shut it off?

875
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:12,208
Is that possible?

876
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,458
Why not?

877
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,542
It's a machine, isn't it?

878
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:17,125
Shut it off.

879
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:21,208
Why? You haven't seen half
of what this beauty can do.

880
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,625
We've seen enough.

881
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:26,000
Does that mean
you're going to buy it?

882
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:27,875
Yes, yes!
We've seen enough!
You made a sale!

883
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,625
You won't be sorry.

884
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,667
Good! Now end
the demonstration!

885
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:33,000
Done.

886
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,500
PICARD:
Number One?

887
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:42,792
Right here.

888
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,500
(<i> sighs</i> )

889
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:46,208
That was close.

890
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,083
La Forge,
everything's all right.

891
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,375
We've neutralized it.

892
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:50,750
(<i> crash</i> )

893
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,125
It's great to hear
your voice, Captain

894
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,500
but we're a little busy
right now.

895
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:54,625
I'll get right back to you.

896
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:55,875
Phasers at full
readiness.

897
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,333
Keep those shields
at full power.

898
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:58,959
Ahead one-quarter.

899
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,333
Heading 25
mark 300.

900
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,583
Sir, that heading
will take us further

901
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,291
into the planet's atmosphere.

902
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,083
That's correct. We're going
to lose some maneuverability

903
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,333
so keep a firm hand
on the helm.

904
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,041
Aye, sir.

905
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,500
You hope our attacker will
follow us into the atmosphere.

906
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:12,917
I'm counting on it.

907
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:14,792
Lian, scan for any
air disruption or vortex.

908
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:16,250
Cloak or no cloak

909
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:17,792
we'll spot it by its turbulence.

910
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,792
Worf, how fast
can you get a
phaser lock?

911
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:21,166
Fast.

912
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,667
Hull temperature 1,000 degrees
and rising.

913
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,000
Emergency power to deflectors.

914
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:24,959
Velocity increasing.

915
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,792
Steady as she goes.

916
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:35,166
Hull temperature
2,500 degrees.

917
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:37,166
Deflectors nearing overload.

918
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,250
(<i> fast beeping</i> )

919
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,250
Sir, helm's going unresponsive.

920
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,083
Can you compensate?
Yes, sir, I can.

921
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,959
Hull 3,000 degrees.

922
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,166
Maintain heading.

923
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,709
WORF:
We're about to lose

924
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,333
number four deflector.

925
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,291
3,300 degrees.

926
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,375
Deflector four
is now inoperative.

927
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:53,583
Turbulence to starboard!

928
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,917
There he is!

929
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:00,959
Scanners locked.

930
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,917
Weapons locked.

931
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:03,083
Fire!

932
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:09,542
Got him!

933
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:12,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

934
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:15,125
Shields down.

935
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:16,458
(<i> beeping</i> )

936
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,125
Locked onto away team.

937
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:20,166
Beaming them home now.

938
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,083
Come to 40, mark 65.

939
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:26,750
Ahead one-third,
and assume a standard orbit.

940
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:27,959
Standard orbit.

941
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,500
Aye, sir.

942
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:31,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

943
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:41,792
Relinquishing command,
Captain.

944
00:43:41,834 --> 00:43:43,250
As you were, Lieutenant.

945
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:45,125
Sir?

946
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:47,375
Mr. La Forge, when I left
this ship, it was in one piece.

947
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,250
I would appreciate
your returning it to me

948
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,166
in the same condition.

949
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:52,375
You concur, Number One?

950
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:53,917
Absolutely, sir.

951
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,333
Lieutenant Solis

952
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:01,250
plot a course to rendezvous
with the Saucer Section.

953
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:02,375
Sick Bay reports

954
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:03,875
Dr. Crusher's
going to be fine.

955
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:07,458
Course plotted
and laid in.

956
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:13,542
Engage.
