1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,917
CRUSHER:
Most of the people
on this colony

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:05,458
will remember
my grandmother as a healer

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,500
but her abilities
went beyond that.

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,667
She didn't just relieve pain
and fight illness.

5
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:15,709
She knew that well-being is
more than just a healthy body.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,291
Her remedies often included
words of advice

7
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,333
as well as medicinal teas

8
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,875
and often they were
just as bitter-tasting.

9
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:27,667
I will miss Felisa Howard
very much--

10
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:31,291
her healing, her advice

11
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,792
and most of all the inspiration

12
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:34,917
she has provided me
throughout the years.

13
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:39,834
Rest in peace, Nana.

14
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,041
(<i> murmurs of "Amen"</i> )

15
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,834
And so now we commit her body
to the ground--

16
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:54,917
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust--

17
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,917
in sure and certain hope

18
00:00:56,959 --> 00:01:01,542
that her memory will be
kept alive within us all.

19
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,291
MAN:
Amen.

20
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,834
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

21
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:13,208
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

22
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,750
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

23
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:18,542
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

24
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:23,125
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

25
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,458
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

26
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:28,917
That was
beautiful.

27
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,458
Oh, thank you.

28
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,166
Deanna, did you notice
a strange man at the service?

29
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,750
He was in his mid-30s,
with longish hair.

30
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:41,458
No.

31
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,250
He threw a flower
on Nana's grave-- a camellia.

32
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,917
It was her favorite flower.

33
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,750
She used to keep them
all over the house.

34
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:51,625
Maybe he was a friend
or one of her patients.

35
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:54,625
It was a very personal gesture

36
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,041
and he gave me
a remarkable look.

37
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:01,375
Well... I guess I should be
going back to the house.

38
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:04,417
There are some things
I need to do.

39
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,542
It's only
a few minutes from here.

40
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,208
Would you mind coming along?

41
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,417
I'd love to.

42
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,959
Thanks.

43
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,041
How long do you
plan on staying?

44
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,583
A few more hours.
Why?

45
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,291
Well, as you
know, Caldos

46
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,625
is one of the first
terraforming projects

47
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,667
of the Federation.

48
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,500
Our weather controls
and fusion systems

49
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,083
are nearly
a century old.

50
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,125
I wouldn't mind having
a starship engineer

51
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,792
take a look at them.

52
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:38,208
Perhaps give us
a few upgrades.

53
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,458
Maybe in exchange for
a tour of the colony

54
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,959
and a home-cooked meal?

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,166
Well, we are due
at Starbase 621
tomorrow morning

56
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,750
but we could delay
for a few days.

57
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,208
Yes, I'm sure we could
find the time.

58
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,375
Excellent.

59
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,417
I would enjoy that tour.

60
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,834
Caldos colony is a most
impressive accomplishment.

61
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,208
I actually feel as if I'm
in the Scottish Highlands.

62
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,917
Well, that was
the intent.

63
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,417
The cornerstone of
every building in town

64
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,125
was brought
from Edinburgh

65
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,000
Glasgow, Aberdeen.

66
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,792
The founders wanted
everyone to feel

67
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:13,792
that they had a piece
of the real thing here.

68
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:16,041
They didn't want to
just imitate Scotland--

69
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,125
they wanted
to re-create it.

70
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,375
Tell me, Governor,
I'm curious.

71
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:24,208
You're obviously
not Scot yourself.

72
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,834
What was it
that drew you here?

73
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:32,333
Oh, something about the
culture, the heritage.

74
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,083
When I was a boy

75
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:38,291
my family visited Glamis
Castle in Scotland

76
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,667
and as I looked out
across the Highlands

77
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,166
I felt as if
I had come home.

78
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:19,041
Your grandmother
had remarkable green eyes.

79
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,542
Every Howard woman
has had green eyes

80
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,333
except for my mother and me.

81
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,250
How well
do you remember your mother?

82
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,667
Very well.

83
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:33,542
I loved her very much.

84
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,583
I can remember...

85
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,041
her face smiling down at me

86
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,291
and I can remember

87
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,667
the sound of her
voice and her scent

88
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:47,166
but, mostly, I remember Nana

89
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:51,375
who raised me
after my mother died.

90
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,709
That's beautiful.

91
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,333
It's a family
heirloom.

92
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,458
It's been in
the Howard clan

93
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,417
for generations.

94
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,542
It's supposed
to symbolize

95
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,417
the enduring
Howard spirit.

96
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,166
"Wherever they may go-

97
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:07,125
the shining light to guide them
through their fortune."

98
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,291
Nana always kept it lit.

99
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,917
I remember sitting here,
listening to ghost stories

100
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,333
with only the candle burning.

101
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,000
You should take it with you.

102
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,208
I think I will.

103
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,041
I'm going to head back
to the ship.

104
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,667
You don't have to leave.

105
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,083
I just thought
you'd like some time alone.

106
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,083
I'll see you later.

107
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,041
Thanks.

108
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,000
(<i> heavy sigh</i> )

109
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,834
Who's there?

110
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,166
What the hell
are you doing?

111
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,667
Get out of my house.

112
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,458
I wouldn't be so high
and mighty with me

113
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,875
Beverly Howard Crusher.

114
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,750
I spent more time here
in the past five years

115
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,500
than you have
in the past 20.

116
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,834
How do you know who I am?

117
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,291
I'm Ned Quint.

118
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,500
I took care of your
grandmother's house

119
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:07,500
and her affairs.

120
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:08,959
Nana never mentioned you.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, there's lots of things
she didn't talk about.

122
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,083
Let me get rid
of that candle.

123
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,458
Why?

124
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,166
That candle has brought
nothing but misery

125
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,667
and bad luck to
your grandmother.

126
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:18,000
Look, Mr. Quint, I don't know

127
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,583
what your relationship was
with my grandmother

128
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,625
but this is<i> my</i> house now
and these are my things.

129
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:23,875
That candle
has been a curse

130
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,709
on your family
for generations.

131
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,166
Now, if you have
a lick of sense

132
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,125
you'll listen to me
right now do away with it.

133
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,625
Now give it to me.

134
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,542
This is a family heirloom
and I intend to keep it!

135
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,667
Now would you please
get out of my house.

136
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,166
Now!

137
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,959
Howard women-- always
the same stubborn fools.

138
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,291
I wash my hands
of it now.

139
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,959
You stay on
in this house

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,959
and you keep that damned candle.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,291
I'll not be responsible
for what happens.

142
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,834
Get out!

143
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,166
The colony's aqueduct system
is functioning normally

144
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,834
as are the communication relays.

145
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,917
We've been having
a few tremors

146
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,166
the last couple of months.

147
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,291
Could you check the
seismic stabilizers?

148
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,458
Certainly.

149
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,667
You can't imagine
what it's like

150
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:12,834
trying to enjoy
afternoon tea

151
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,291
while the earth
is shaking.

152
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,709
Governor, did you know
you had a power fluctuation

153
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,208
in your weather
control system?

154
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,875
No, our weather control's
been working perfectly

155
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,583
for the last 22 years.

156
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,291
I can't isolate
the exact source

157
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,208
but the fluctuation
seems to be originating

158
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,959
from one of the substations
that regulates

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,083
atmospheric humidity
for the colony.

160
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,458
Is this going
to be a problem?

161
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,166
No, not yet,
but power distribution patterns

162
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,208
are already off by five percent.

163
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,333
I suggest we analyze
the planet's weather patterns

164
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,875
to see
if they have been affected.

165
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,500
I am reading
unusually high humidity

166
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:47,250
across the entire
southern desert region

167
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,709
and there is increasing
cloud activity

168
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,375
above the northern
coastal area--

169
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,834
possibly the formation
of a storm system.

170
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,834
A storm?
It's the middle of summer.

171
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,125
We don't have rain
at this time of year.

172
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,875
Data, let's see
if we can correct this.

173
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,083
I'll check out the colony's
climatic flow array.

174
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,542
I will run a diagnostic
on the thermal regulators.

175
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,667
Don't worry, Governor.

176
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:07,792
We'll keep you dry.

177
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,333
I certainly hope so.

178
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,750
There's a caber toss scheduled
for tomorrow afternoon.

179
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:14,750
I'd hate to see it spoiled
by an unexpected downpour.

180
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,291
You wouldn't believe
what I've been reading about

181
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,667
in my grandmother's journals.

182
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,083
You know she had a lover.

183
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,208
Do you believe that?

184
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,000
Nana was 100 years old.

185
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,750
Mmm. It would seem
that the Howard women

186
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:32,500
have exceptionally
vigorous libidos.

187
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,375
I certainly hope so.

188
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:35,750
After all,
I hope I can find

189
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,625
a handsome young man
in his 30s

190
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,417
when I've passed
the century mark.

191
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,625
Thirties?

192
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,792
Yes. According
to these journals

193
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:46,250
his name is Ronin
and he's 34 years old.

194
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:50,208
They met just after
my great-grandmother's death

195
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,291
and I think I saw him
at the funeral.

196
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:56,208
A handsome young man tossed
a camellia onto her grave

197
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,792
but the strange thing is

198
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:02,333
she never mentioned him
in her letters, never once

199
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,750
and yet it appears

200
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:06,542
they spent almost all
their time together.

201
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,959
It's as if she led
an entire life

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that I knew
nothing about.

203
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,875
Well, it looks as if
we're going to be on Caldos

204
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,333
for a few days more.

205
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,250
This will be
a good opportunity

206
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,625
for you to get your
grandmother's affairs in order.

207
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,208
Thank you.

208
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,208
Thirties?

209
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:18,375
MAN:
<i>Beverly...</i>

210
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:20,166
(<i> gasping</i> )

211
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,333
You dreamt you were in bed
with someone?

212
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,583
Not exactly.

213
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,250
I was in bed

214
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,375
but there wasn't another person
in my dream.

215
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:37,291
It was more like a presence.

216
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,250
You said you felt a touch.

217
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,166
A pair of hands.

218
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,458
They were moving
across my skin.

219
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,667
Like a caress?

220
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,917
Yes, and there was a voice,
a man.

221
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:51,125
He whispered my name.

222
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,375
It was as if I knew him

223
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,667
or more like he knew me.

224
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,834
He knew exactly
how I liked to be touched.

225
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,250
It was the most
physical dream

226
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,083
I've ever had.

227
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,917
The sensations were very real

228
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,458
and extremely arousing.

229
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,417
Frankly, I'm envious.

230
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,250
I did fall asleep reading
a particularly erotic chapter

231
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,792
in my grandmother's journal.

232
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,667
She wrote
very detailed descriptions

233
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,500
of her experiences
with Ronin.

234
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:26,917
Well, that's bound
to cause a dream or two.

235
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,417
So, shall we start going
over the personnel reports?

236
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:34,041
You know, I think he had
a ring on one of his hands

237
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,250
when he touched
my shoulder, my neck.

238
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:42,750
I wonder if I'll have
another dream tonight.

239
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,709
I'd read two chapters.

240
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,917
You probably want
to be alone.

241
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:14,917
I'll leave.

242
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,458
No, Ned. It's okay.

243
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,458
Look, I'm sorry we got off
to a bad start yesterday.

244
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,041
I've been reading
my grandmother's journals

245
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,875
and I know how much
you meant to her.

246
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:26,417
Aye. She was a grand lady.

247
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,542
You'll not see many
more like her.

248
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,792
You have your
grandmother's fire

249
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,917
that's for sure.

250
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,625
Ned, you're welcome

251
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:38,000
to stay at the house
after I've gone.

252
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,500
I need someone
to take care of the place.

253
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,500
That's very kind
of you, lass

254
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,709
but I'll ne'er set foot
in that house again

255
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,583
and I recommend that
you do not either.

256
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,792
Why?

257
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:49,542
Like I tried to tell
your grandmother

258
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,250
the house is haunted.

259
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,792
Haunted?

260
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,250
You believe what you want, lass.

261
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,375
Just do not light that candle.

262
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:58,583
Why not?

263
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,917
It'll bring the ghost.
It's his home.

264
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,041
Oh, he's out now,
wandering across the land

265
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,875
angry,
angry at being driven out.

266
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:08,917
That's why
he's bringing the storms.

267
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,000
Ned, the weather system's
control is malfunctioning.

268
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,375
The<i> Enterprise</i>
is trying to repair it.

269
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:18,083
Oh, sure, but who do you think
is causing the malfunction?

270
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,375
I think your imagination is...

271
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:22,500
Think what you want,
see what you want.

272
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:25,250
Just do as I say.

273
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,875
Do not light that candle

274
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,333
and do not go
to that house

275
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,834
or before you know it

276
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,834
I'll be burying another Howard
in this cemetery.

277
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,792
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

278
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,792
Captain, I am detecting
atmospheric turbulence

279
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:08,083
over the colony

280
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,291
and large pockets
of electrical activity.

281
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,834
On screen.

282
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,542
WORF:
It is growing in intensity, sir.

283
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,667
That's one hell
of a thunderstorm.

284
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:19,750
Bridge to Engineering.

285
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,333
Mr. Data, we're reading

286
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,709
an extremely large storm system
over the Caldos colony.

287
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,083
I thought that the
weather control malfunction

288
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,500
was not severe.

289
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,667
It began as a minor
power fluctuation, sir

290
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:33,709
but the effect has spread
throughout the control grid.

291
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,458
It has caused
an unusual concentration

292
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,125
of cumulonimbus activity
above the colony.

293
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,166
Captain, I suggest we
set up a power transfer

294
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,625
between the<i> Enterprise</i> and
the weather substations--

295
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:45,291
try to give them enough power
to stabilize the storm.

296
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,709
PICARD:
Make it so.

297
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,083
(<i> gasps</i> )

298
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,375
(<i> gasps</i> )

299
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:17,542
(<i> creaking</i> )

300
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,208
Who's there?!

301
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,083
Ned?!

302
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,709
Is that you?

303
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,417
Hello!

304
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,375
(<i> loud thump</i> )

305
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,917
I know somebody's here,
so I suggest you...

306
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,333
(<i> rattling</i> )

307
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,000
(<i> gasping</i> )

308
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,375
(<i> mirror shatters</i> )

309
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,083
All right, now, that's it.

310
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,291
If you don't show yourself
right now

311
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,667
I am calling the<i> Enterprise</i>

312
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:11,041
and there
will be ten security guards here

313
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,875
within 30 seconds.

314
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,834
MAN (<i> whispering):</i>
<i>Beverly.</i>

315
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,875
<i>Beverly,</i>
<i>I've come back for you.</i>

316
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:25,291
Who are you?

317
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,083
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

318
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,125
<i>I came to you last night</i>
<i>while you were asleep.</i>

319
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,542
No, that was a dream.

320
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,542
I'm calling the<i> Enterprise.</i>

321
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,917
<i>Now do you remember me?</i>

322
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,291
Yes.

323
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,500
What's...

324
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:51,500
what's happening to me?

325
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:53,750
Right now, I feel so strange.

326
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,542
<i>I love you, Beverly</i>

327
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,792
<i>just as I loved Felisa</i>
<i>before you.</i>

328
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
Are you Ronin?

329
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,875
<i>Yes.</i>

330
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:10,166
<i>You saw me at the funeral.</i>

331
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:18,500
Who are you?!

332
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,375
<i>I am a spirit.</i>

333
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:24,500
I don't believe in...

334
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,834
<i>Ghosts?</i>

335
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,750
<i>Nor did I in the beginning.</i>

336
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:34,834
<i>I was born in 1647</i>
<i>in Glasgow on Earth.</i>

337
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,917
You're telling me

338
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:40,792
that you're
an 800-year-old ghost?

339
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:43,875
<i>I found a home</i>
<i>with Jessel Howard.</i>

340
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:47,583
<i>She was a pretty lass</i>
<i>with a mane of red hair</i>

341
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,750
<i>and eyes like diamonds.</i>

342
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,542
<i>Oh, I loved her very much.</i>

343
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,625
<i>When she died</i>

344
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:59,875
<i>I stayed with her daughter</i>
<i>and her daughter</i>

345
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:04,083
<i>and on down through the years,</i>
<i>generation after generation.</i>

346
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,208
And now you're here on Caldos,
200 light-years away?

347
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,875
<i>When your family moved out</i>
<i>into the galaxy</i>

348
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:23,125
<i>I moved with them.</i>

349
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,917
I don't believe you.

350
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:28,959
<i>I believe you are</i>
<i>the most beautiful women</i>

351
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
<i>I have ever known.</i>

352
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,500
Oh, what's...

353
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,917
what's happening to me?

354
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:38,041
<i>We're becoming one, Beverly.</i>

355
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,000
<i>We're going to be together.</i>

356
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,542
I don't understand.

357
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,083
Stop it!

358
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

359
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:53,583
CRUSHER:
Come in.

360
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,959
Hi, Bev. I just wanted
too see if you were going

361
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,792
to<i> Mok'bara</i> class
this morning.

362
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,959
No, I think I'm going
to skip it today.

363
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,417
I'm exhausted.

364
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,500
Did you have
another dream last night?

365
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:07,291
Not exactly.

366
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,750
Is anything wrong?

367
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:11,500
Not at all.

368
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:13,667
Beverly, if I didn't know
any better

369
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:16,375
I'd say you were seeing someone.

370
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,417
Deanna...

371
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,542
Now I know

372
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,583
you're seeing someone.

373
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,542
I'm not seeing anybody.

374
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,458
I met someone, that's all.

375
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,458
Well, you obviously have
romantic feelings for him.

376
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,709
Beverly,
when are you going

377
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,458
to realize
that you can't fool me?

378
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,250
Who is it?

379
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,166
All right.

380
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,291
I met Ronin.

381
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,959
Ronin?

382
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,750
Your grandmother's lover?

383
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,583
He's unlike anyone
I've ever met before.

384
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:57,208
I know this sounds
crazy, but...

385
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,291
I have never known
anyone who is so...

386
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,375
Passionate.

387
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,917
Exactly.

388
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:05,291
I can see why Nana
fell in love with him.

389
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:12,333
This sounds very strange,
doesn't it?

390
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,208
I admit it's...

391
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,792
unusual.

392
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:20,083
I'm very happy for you.

393
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:27,583
But I want you
to consider something.

394
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:32,083
You and Ronin have both suffered
a tremendous loss.

395
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,417
Very often

396
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,583
shared traumatic
experience
can create

397
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,667
the illusion of closeness...

398
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,875
and romance.

399
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:43,792
Well, thank you
for your concern

400
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:46,166
but I think
I know what I'm doing.

401
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,625
Besides, I didn't say
I was in love with him.

402
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,333
I'm just intrigued.

403
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,208
You know, Captain,
I moved to this colony

404
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,041
because it was a
re-creation of Scotland

405
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:06,166
but I must admit it's getting
to be a little too realistic.

406
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,583
(<i> sneezing</i> )

407
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,625
What the hell
is going on?

408
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,375
There appears to be a
condensed suspension

409
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:15,542
of water vapor

410
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,959
approximately
one degree Celsius.

411
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,125
Fog.

412
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,917
It just sort of rolled
in on us, sir.

413
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,291
There has been a malfunction

414
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,458
in the ship's
environmental control.

415
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
We've traced
the problem

416
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:27,583
to the power transfer beam.

417
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,000
There's some sort
of feedback coming

418
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,083
from one of the colony's
weather substations.

419
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,500
Another power fluctuation?

420
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:34,667
WORF:
Captain the temperature
in Ten-Forward

421
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:36,375
has dropped below freezing

422
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:38,667
and deck 13 has lost gravity.

423
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,834
Mr. Data, disengage
the power transfer.

424
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:45,083
I am unable to terminate
the connection, sir.

425
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:48,166
A feedback loop has formed
in the transfer beam.

426
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:49,709
I will have to go
to the substation

427
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,792
and attempt to correct the
problem from there.

428
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:53,417
Make it so.

429
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,875
In the meantime

430
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:57,625
I think I'll go
get my jacket.

431
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,000
DATA:
I have analyzed
the control module

432
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:08,417
in the primary
weather control grid.

433
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,000
It appears the station
is experiencing

434
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,834
a system-wide
power failure.

435
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:12,875
This is impossible.

436
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:13,834
The backup system
should have...

437
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,000
(<i> loud beeping</i> )

438
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,208
DATA:
Excuse me, sir.

439
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,250
You are dismantling

440
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,750
the primary
power conduit.

441
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:21,291
I must ask you
to stop.

442
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,083
No!

443
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,041
Get away from me!

444
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:30,959
You don't understand!

445
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,500
He's trying to kill us all!

446
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:34,333
(<i> moans</i> )

447
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,125
He is dead.

448
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,750
From what I can tell he was
trying to shut down

449
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,792
the entire
weather control system.

450
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:57,375
He was pulling out
the primary plasma conduit.

451
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:58,500
It's probably what caused

452
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,250
the plasma discharge
that killed him.

453
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,333
I knew Ned Quint.

454
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,500
He was an honest man.

455
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:03,917
He kept mostly to himself.

456
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,959
I don't know why he'd
try something like that.

457
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,083
Well, it's going
to take us some time

458
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,667
to get the system
back on line.

459
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,834
I'd say we need
another day at least.

460
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,333
In the meantime, Governor
you should expect

461
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,917
the weather problems
to continue.

462
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:16,500
CRUSHER:
I think you better
take a look at this.

463
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:23,959
Data, you said
there was a plasma discharge

464
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,917
from the console
when Quint was killed.

465
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,625
That is correct.

466
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,667
Well, that wasn't
what killed him.

467
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:30,917
I'm detecting
an anomalous

468
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,709
energy residual
throughout his body

469
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,500
right down
to the cellular level.

470
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:35,917
Whatever it is

471
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:39,667
it wasn't the result
of a plasma discharge.

472
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:40,917
Anything?

473
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,417
I cannot identify
the energy residual.

474
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:46,250
However, it appears to have
the same anaphasic signature

475
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,750
as the power fluctuations

476
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:50,083
we observed from
the weather control system.

477
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,542
It's possible
that whatever caused

478
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:53,709
the weather malfunctions
also killed Quint.

479
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,208
It is possible.

480
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,208
We should scan the colony
for any energy readings

481
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,250
that match this
anaphasic signature.

482
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:04,333
Governor, with
your permission

483
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,166
I'd like to take the body
back to the ship

484
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,375
to run further tests.

485
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,875
Of course, Doctor.

486
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,333
Ensign, ask Dr. Selar

487
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,333
to run a biospectral
analysis.

488
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,709
Yes, Doctor.

489
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,959
You're not going to run
the tests yourself?

490
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,375
No, I have some things
I need to attend to.

491
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,792
Ronin, I've got to talk to you.

492
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:29,959
Are you here?

493
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,250
<i>I'm here.</i>

494
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:35,125
<i>Beverly, did you miss me?</i>

495
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:37,417
Yes.

496
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:41,000
But I must talk to you.

497
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,667
There's been an accident.

498
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,000
<i>I know.</i>

499
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,041
<i>Quint is dead.</i>

500
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,041
Well, why did it happen?

501
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,667
What was he doing?

502
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,583
<i>Beverly, there's</i>
<i>something more important</i>

503
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,834
<i>we should talk about.</i>

504
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,834
Ronin, I've got to know.

505
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,375
Quint's dead.

506
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,250
Ronin.

507
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:03,458
Yes.

508
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,250
I need you to help me.

509
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:09,667
Help you?

510
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:14,208
It's not easy for me
to take corporeal form.

511
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,125
I can't do it for long.

512
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:23,250
I want you to
light the candle.

513
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:24,750
Quint said you lived
in the candle.

514
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,083
Is that true?

515
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:29,834
Yes, if I'm away
from it for too long

516
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,208
I begin to weaken.

517
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,458
That's why the women
in your family

518
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,417
have always kept
the candle lit.

519
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,875
The candle's on the ship.

520
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:40,875
I'll go get it.

521
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:43,709
No.

522
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,959
I must go with you.

523
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,125
How?

524
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:50,000
The power transfer beam--
I can travel along it.

525
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:53,000
Then when the candle's lit,
then what happens?

526
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:56,500
Then we'll be together...

527
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,125
always.

528
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:40,375
Computer, secure door.

529
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:05,917
I lit the candle.

530
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:07,375
Where are you?

531
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:20,208
Shh, shh.
It's all right.

532
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,375
We're together.

533
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,500
We're going to be one.

534
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:26,750
I'm going to become
part of you, Beverly.

535
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,333
Would you like that?

536
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:30,041
Oh, yes, more
than anything.

537
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,709
As it was with your grandmother
and your great-grandmother

538
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,417
and all of the Howard women
before them.

539
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:39,417
I'll take care of you

540
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:43,834
and you will feel love
as you've never felt it before.

541
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,667
Beverly,
what the hell is this?

542
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,625
I thought it was pretty
self-explanatory.

543
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:19,750
I'm leaving Starfleet.

544
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:20,750
Energize.

545
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:21,750
Belay that order.

546
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:25,291
Aye, sir.

547
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,750
Beverly, you can't just resign.

548
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:29,625
I can,
and I have.

549
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,208
I've decided to stay on Caldos

550
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,709
and become a healer
like my grandmother.

551
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,166
It's a proud
Howard tradition

552
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,875
and I've decided to uphold it.
Energize.

553
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,208
I've resigned my commission

554
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,709
so, unless you plan
on kidnapping me...

555
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,500
Beverly was attracted
to Ronin

556
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:10,834
in a very intense
and... intimate way.

557
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,959
I warned her that it
was all very sudden

558
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,583
but she didn't want
to talk about it

559
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:17,500
so I let her alone.

560
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:20,250
I sensed that she was
holding something back.

561
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:22,166
That she wasn't telling me
the whole truth.

562
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,458
Do you think this Ronin could be

563
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,375
exerting some sort
of influence over her?

564
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:28,625
That it's because of him
that she's staying?

565
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:30,625
It's possible

566
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:34,125
but she may really believe
she's in love with him.

567
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,917
This is a rash decision.

568
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,291
Ill-considered.

569
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,750
It's not like Beverly at all.

570
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,208
I agree

571
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,333
but she does have the right
to make that choice

572
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,792
even if we don't feel
it's a good one.

573
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,333
(<i> door chimes</i> )

574
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:50,375
Come.

575
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:54,792
Captain, Geordi and I have
detected an energy residual

576
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,375
with the same
anaphasic signature

577
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,542
as the one we found
on Ned Quint's body.

578
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,291
Where?

579
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:03,500
Approximately 17 kilometers from
the center of the colony, sir.

580
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,250
It is coming
from the cemetery.

581
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,542
Data, I want you to go
down to the cemetery.

582
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:12,500
See if you can
pinpoint the source.

583
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,125
Aye, sir.

584
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:18,917
In the meantime

585
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:22,166
I would like to meet
with this Ronin.

586
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,750
(<i> tricorders beeping</i> )

587
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,208
LA FORGE:
The energy readings are coming
from this direction

588
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,542
but I can't get
an exact location.

589
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:39,625
I'll try narrowing
the scan field.

590
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,542
DATA:
The energy readings
appear to be originating

591
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:44,041
approximately two meters
below the surface.

592
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,291
I believe they are
concentrated

593
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,166
within this burial site.

594
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:14,709
I'm so glad you're here.

595
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,917
I can't imagine

596
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:19,542
what life was like
before I met you.

597
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:22,709
And it will only
get better.

598
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:37,208
Oh, Ronin.

599
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,083
I had no idea
I could feel this way.

600
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,250
(<i> whispering</i> ):
<i>We're nearly merged now</i>

601
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:45,417

<i>to form a single light</i>

602
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,667

603

(<i> knocking</i> )

604
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,750
<i>I love you, Beverly.</i>

605
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,792
(<i> knocking</i> )

606
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:58,333
I love you.

607
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,083
Beverly?

608
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:20,834
Jean-Luc.

609
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:22,125
I'm sorry
I startled you.

610
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,667
I knocked,
but there was no answer.

611
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:25,834
The door was open.

612
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,041
I hope you
don't mind.

613
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,458
What do you want?

614
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,333
Well, I'd hoped to meet
your new friend Ronin.

615
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,041
He's not here.

616
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:34,083
Well, perhaps
I could wait

617
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,667
if you don't mind.

618
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:38,333
I'm really anxious to meet
this remarkable young man

619
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:42,291
who has swept away not just one,
but two of the Howard women.

620
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:47,375
Jealousy doesn't suit you,
Jean-Luc.

621
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:48,834
Have you...

622
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:51,417
have you changed
the color of your eyes?

623
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:55,333
I... I just grew tired
of the other color.

624
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,375
Don't you think it
suits me?

625
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,667
I think that
I preferred

626
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:01,625
your eyes the way
they were before.

627
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:05,125
I think I preferred<i> you</i> the way
you were before, Beverly.

628
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:08,000
Well, this is
the way I am now

629
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,792
and this is my life.

630
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:11,959
I've made my decision

631
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,208
and I'm not going
to change my mind

632
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,500
so please leave me alone.

633
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:16,375
Oh, no, there's
something's wrong here.

634
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:18,709
Now, Beverly, this
is more than just

635
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,125
an obsessive love affair
that has got out of hand.

636
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,500
Tell me, why is
it that no one

637
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:25,542
has seen this Ronin
except you?

638
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:29,750
RONIN:
All right, Captain.

639
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,834
Here I am.

640
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,250
I believe Beverly asked you
to leave her alone.

641
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,583
So, you're Ronin.

642
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:47,083
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

643
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,458
Where are you from?

644
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,875
Earth. Scotland.

645
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,083
How long have you been
on Caldos?

646
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:56,208
All that matters
is that I'm here now

647
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,083
and that Beverly and I
plan to be together

648
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:01,208
for the rest of our lives.

649
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,333
Data to Picard.

650
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,458
Go ahead, Data.

651
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,750
Captain, we have
located the source

652
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,625
of the energy residual.

653
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,000
It appears to be concentrated

654
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:10,625
within Felisa Howard's coffin.

655
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:13,166
LA FORGE:
Captain, we'd like permission
to exhume the body.

656
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:16,208
You can't do that.

657
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,625
Leave her alone.

658
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,000
Why not?

659
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:20,375
What are you afraid of?

660
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:22,792
I'm not afraid
of anything

661
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:26,417
but I cannot allow you
to desecrate her grave.

662
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,291
Data, ask Governor Maturin's
permission

663
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,834
to exhume the body.

664
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,166
Picard out.

665
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,709
I won't stand for this.

666
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,458
I'll go to the Governor myself.

667
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,875
Go on.

668
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:40,583
I wouldn't be surprised
if he doesn't know who you are.

669
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,959
He'll probably have
the same questions

670
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,333
that I do.

671
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,417
How did you get here?

672
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,458
What ship did
you come on?

673
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,917
Jean-Luc, leave him alone.

674
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:49,709
Why don't you answer
my questions? What ship?

675
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,709
I'd like to take a look

676
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,875
at the passenger list.

677
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:53,250
Where have you
been living here?

678
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,542
What's your position?

679
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,083
Who are your neighbors?

680
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,667
Come on, Beverly.
We've got to get out of here.

681
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,959
Jean-Luc!

682
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,542
RONIN:
<i>Beverly, we must</i>
<i>stop the others.</i>

683
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,250
<i>They cannot exhume the body.</i>

684
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:17,250
We can't just leave him.

685
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,333
He might die.

686
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:19,458
<i>You must come.</i>

687
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,834
<i>I am your love.</i>

688
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,125
<i>I am the one</i>
<i>who will take care of you.</i>

689
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:27,083
I can't just let him die.

690
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:29,750
Beverly,
come with me!

691
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:31,333
No.

692
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,792
No!

693
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:39,625
I'm sorry.

694
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,083
I'm going to stop them.

695
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,333
Come on, come on.

696
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:00,709
I'm all right.

697
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,333
Beverly, go after him.

698
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,834
Go to the cemetery.

699
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,583
La Forge to<i> Enterprise.</i>
We're ready down here.

700
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:12,750
Aye, sir.

701
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,041
I am reading definite signs

702
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,417
of anaphasic energy
in her body.

703
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,792
It appears to extend
to the cellular level.

704
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,291
That's impossible.

705
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,667
She was nowhere near
the weather station

706
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:41,375
when Quint was killed.

707
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,667
She died of
natural causes.

708
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:45,291
I suggest we run
a deep tissue scan

709
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:47,208
to look for
any signs of...

710
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:51,375
(<i> groaning</i> )

711
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:54,125
CRUSHER:
No!

712
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:56,208
Ronin, stop this.

713
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,041
Stop this, please.

714
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:00,333
Beverly, it's all right.

715
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:02,041
Have trust in me.

716
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,458
You're not Nana.

717
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,542
Nana's dead.

718
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:07,166
Leave her alone!

719
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:14,208
Beverly!

720
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,041
Forgive me.

721
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,250
These men were trying
to stop us

722
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,375
from being together.

723
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,375
Once they're gone

724
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,417
everything will be right.

725
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:21,542
No, it won't.

726
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,792
You've been infusing me

727
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:24,000
with the same sort
of anaphasic energy

728
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,333
that killed Quint.

729
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,917
He was trying to destroy me.

730
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:32,166
I had to defend myself.

731
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,250
Oh, my love.

732
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:37,834
I would never harm you.

733
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:40,667
I am here to protect you.

734
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:43,000
No, you're not.

735
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,375
There's no such thing
as a ghost.

736
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:47,625
You are some sort

737
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,917
of anaphasic
life-form.

738
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:52,542
Anaphasic energy
is extremely unstable.

739
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,083
It needs an organic host

740
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,333
in order to maintain
molecular cohesion

741
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:58,208
or else you'll die,
isn't that right?

742
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,208
Beverly.

743
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,500
I also scanned
the candle.

744
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,166
The flame is plasma-based.

745
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,917
You were using it
as a receptacle for yourself

746
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:05,250
in order
to get to me.

747
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:06,750
In order to merge with me!

748
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:10,667
You have been using<i> me,</i>
Nana, my entire family

749
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:12,250
for centuries!

750
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:14,875
And I loved all of them!

751
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:16,625
And they loved me.

752
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:26,208
Give me the candle, Beverly.

753
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,000
No, no.

754
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:37,125
Put it down...

755
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:38,917
or I will kill him.

756
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,000
Set it down and walk away.

757
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,166
No!

758
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:00,792
Crusher to Riker.

759
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:02,750
Will, close off all
the plasma conduits

760
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:04,250
in the weather
control systems.

761
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:05,166
I'll explain later.

762
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:06,709
RIKER:
Understood.

763
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:13,291
You've nowhere left to go.

764
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:20,875
Yes... I do.

765
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,083
Keep away from me.

766
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,083
(<i> groaning</i> )

767
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:37,709
Beverly.

768
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,625
I love you.

769
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:42,542
Bever...

770
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,500
(<i> sobbing</i> )

771
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,125
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

772
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:58,291
<i>Commander La Forge and Mr. Data</i>
<i>have recovered</i>

773
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:01,083
<i>from their exposure</i>
<i>to the anaphasic energy</i>

774
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,458
<i>but I'm afraid</i>
<i>Dr. Crusher's recovery</i>

775
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,041
<i>will be</i>
<i>of a more personal nature.</i>

776
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:10,125
Somehow, he realized
that one of my ancestors

777
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:11,667
had a biochemistry

778
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:14,291
that was compatible
with his energy matrix.

779
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:22,166
I imagine that he
took on human form

780
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:25,208
and seduced her
like he did me.

781
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:29,333
I was about to be initiated

782
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:33,834
into a very unusual
relationship.

783
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:37,166
You might call it
a family tradition.

784
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:40,208
But there's a part of me
that's a little sad.

785
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,709
How so?

786
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:49,125
I re-read the entries
in my grandmother's journals.

787
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:52,208
Whatever else he might
have done

788
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,667
he made her very happy.
