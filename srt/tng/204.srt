1
00:00:01,458 --> 00:00:05,458
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42402.7.</i>

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,250
<i>We are traveling</i>
<i>in the Omega Sagitta system</i>

3
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,458
<i>traversing</i>
<i>between the twin planets</i>

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,709
<i>that form the Coalition</i>
<i>of Madena.</i>

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,667
<i>Both worlds are populated</i>
<i>by a humanoid race</i>

6
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:18,542
<i>which colonized the planets</i>
<i>two centuries ago</i>

7
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,041
<i>and which now coexist</i>

8
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:23,375
<i>under a precarious</i>
<i>but successful treaty.</i>

9
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:27,166
Unidentified vessel
approaching.

10
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:34,250
DATA:
Sensor readings
show it to be

11
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,959
a small Class 9 vessel.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,917
Probably an interplanetary
cargo ship.

13
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,667
One life sign aboard, sir.

14
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,750
WORF:
It appears
to be humanoid.

15
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:46,834
I have its call sign now, sir.

16
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,000
WORF:
Confirmed.

17
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,709
Armed with lasers only.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,625
Its cargo holds are empty.

19
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,959
The readout shows its guidance
system is malfunctioning.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,583
The pilot is attempting
to hold course manually.

21
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:00,750
I recommend
we set the<i> Enterprise</i>

22
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:02,125
on an intercept course

23
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,959
in case he needs
emergency assistance.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,792
Make it so, Mr. Crusher.

25
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:28,125
We're in position now,
Captain.

26
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,291
Open hailing
frequencies.

27
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,000
Hailing frequencies open.

28
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,583
On viewer.

29
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,417
This is the USS<i> Enterprise</i>

30
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,000
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

31
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,208
And this is the Cargo Carrier
<i>Erstwhile.</i>

32
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,250
Captain Okona
at your service, sir.

33
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,333
There's no need
for your phasers, Captain.

34
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,083
I'm harmless
and not quite yet ready

35
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,917
for a mercy killing.

36
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,458
You were never considered
a danger, Captain.

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,083
Oh, that's a shame.

38
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:54,792
I can remember when I was
at least considered a risk.

39
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,166
I'm the owner and operator
of this craft

40
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,959
and since we both know
that you've already scanned it

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,625
you know I'm alone and empty,
which is truly a rare occasion

42
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,750
for a man
of my charm and talent.

43
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,375
Mute main viewer.

44
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:10,458
Counselor?

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,208
His emotions
suggest

46
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,917
he's mischievous, irreverent,
and somewhat brazen.

47
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,625
The word that seems
to best describe him is "rogue."

48
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:24,166
Rogue?

49
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:28,792
Ah, cad, knave, rake, rascal,
villain, wild elephant...

50
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:32,959
Yes, Data, but there is
no malevolence or ill will.

51
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,583
Audio on.
Do you have a burnout

52
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,959
in your guidance system,
Captain?

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,625
Whoa.

54
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,375
Since you're able
to diagnose my problems

55
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,333
how about helping me fix them?

56
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:48,458
Captain, we can easily repair
the type of system he uses.

57
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,208
We can accommodate
you, Captain.

58
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,750
This is the First Officer, sir.

59
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,625
If you prepare
to shut down your engines

60
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,667
we can lock on the tractor
and beam you over here.

61
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,000
Sir, recommend limited access
to our ship.

62
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,291
Agreed.

63
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,625
Data, lock on the tractor beam.

64
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,500
Transporter Chief,
prepare to beam him aboard.

65
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:05,208
Ready on your command, sir.

66
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,917
OKONA:
Excuse me, Commander.

67
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:09,917
Is that a woman's voice I hear?

68
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,333
Yes. Now please
follow Commander
Riker's instructions

69
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,583
so our ship can get back
to its normal routine.

70
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,417
Whatever you say, Captain.

71
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,458
Something funny?

72
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,166
Well, the unexpected<i> is</i>
our normal routine.

73
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:50,166
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

74
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:54,250
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

75
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,083
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

76
00:03:56,125 --> 00:04:00,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

77
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:04,667
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

78
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,166
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

79
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,125
Hold it steady, Wesley.

80
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,291
Ready to link up on my command.

81
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,500
Aye, sir.

82
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,291
Easy.

83
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,875
Easy.

84
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,291
Engage.

85
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,291
Captain Okona,
shut down your engines.

86
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,875
Understood.

87
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,625
Transporter Room, prepare
for the beaming operation.

88
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,709
We're on our way.

89
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,917
Wesley, Data,
let's go.

90
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,542
Your weapons, please.

91
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,041
A Klingon security officer.

92
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,709
Yes.

93
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,041
No wars available, eh?

94
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:15,625
It's more a piece of jewelry
than a weapon.

95
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,125
A remembrance.

96
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,333
Welcome aboard, Captain Okona.
I'm Commander Riker.

97
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,959
If you'll turn over
the inoperative part

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,917
to Commander Data,
we can begin repairs.

99
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,375
I'd be most happy to do the work
myself, Commander.

100
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,500
I'm sort of the hands-on type.

101
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,792
I think you'd find the tools
we use rather unusual, sir.

102
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,500
I can believe that.

103
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:38,959
May I at least watch?

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,041
That can be arranged.

105
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,417
Good then.

106
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,125
Commander, I leave this
in your capable hands.

107
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,166
Sir, this is
Commander Data.

108
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,667
I'm just an acting ensign.

109
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,375
Well, acting ensigns have names,
don't they?

110
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,333
Wesley.

111
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,333
Wesley Crusher.

112
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,834
Nice to meet you

113
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,500
Acting Ensign
Wesley, Wesley Crusher.

114
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,041
And thank you
for beaming me here

115
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:08,709
and enabling me to see
a truly beautiful woman.

116
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,709
You have the
majestic carriage
and loveliness

117
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,125
that could surely
be traced back to
the noblest families.

118
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,959
Well, I'm sure
you've said that
to many ladies before.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,500
And it was no more true
then, than it is now.

120
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,959
But it's how I say it
that's really important.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,500
The warmth, the attraction
that I have for you

122
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:34,250
the attraction that we share.

123
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:40,834
Mr. Okona appears
to have excellent vision

124
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,333
as well as a healthy libido.

125
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,959
Captain Okona, if you'll
follow Commander Data

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,834
you can get started right away.

127
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,792
Now, that's sex appeal.

128
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:03,875
Sexual attraction
in this context

129
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,709
is not a part
of my programming.

130
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,208
I am an android.

131
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,792
Well then, have you seen any
good-looking computers lately?

132
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,208
That's a joke.

133
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,917
It's funny.

134
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,125
Oh.

135
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,458
Of course it is.

136
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,417
(<i> forced laughter</i> )

137
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,750
Will that do
what the original did?

138
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,166
Sure will,
and better.

139
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,375
Let me show you.

140
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,834
On your old one here

141
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,417
the zelebium contacts
wore down and then fused.

142
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,583
Now, what I've done

143
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,834
is replace them
with tricellite.

144
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,875
Tricellite isn't available
in this system.

145
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,208
If I ever had
to replace it...

146
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,417
Don't worry, you won't.

147
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,458
Your ship will never
outlast this part.

148
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,166
Because of the part
or the way I fly my ship?

149
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,792
(<i> laughing</i> )

150
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,458
Well, this part,
<i>but</i> the stress test

151
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,875
did show that you tend
to push your ship

152
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,959
a little beyond
its design capabilities.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,750
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Blame the pattern of my life,
Lieutenant La Forge.

154
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:08,250
Because it relegates me
to cargo carrying

155
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,875
rather than the grand
explorations you enjoy

156
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,875
I am forced to add a measure
of flamboyancy and zest

157
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,792
to the doldrum
of my existence.

158
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,875
Have you ever been cold?

159
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,208
No.

160
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,166
Warm, then?

161
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,542
No.

162
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,583
What about drunk?
Ever do that?

163
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,834
From alcohol?

164
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,667
That is not possible
for me, sir.

165
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:36,291
Pity.

166
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,875
What about love?

167
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:40,291
The act or the emotion?

168
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,667
They're both the same.

169
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,291
I believe that statement
to be inaccurate, sir.

170
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,583
Maybe.

171
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:52,667
Life is like loading
twice your cargo weight

172
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,333
onto your spacecraft.

173
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,959
If it's canaries

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,208
and you can keep half of them
flying all of the time

175
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,166
you're all right.

176
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,250
I doubt that statement is
entirely accurate either, sir.

177
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,333
Accurate?
That was a joke
I just told you.

178
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,041
I do not understand.

179
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,750
You don't know
what a joke is?

180
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,166
Of course I do.

181
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,125
It is a witticism,
a gag, a<i> bon mot</i>

182
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,667
a fluctuation of words
concluding with a trick ending.

183
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:20,959
That's the dictionary meaning.

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,250
I'm talking about humor, fun.

185
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,875
Do you know what funny is?

186
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:29,834
Where is 806?

187
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,792
Right over there, sir.

188
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,375
Why?

189
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:38,458
You probably wouldn't
understand that, either.

190
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,792
Hello there.

191
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,458
Status on the repair?

192
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,250
Working on it.

193
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,291
Commander, what do you
think of Captain Okona?

194
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,834
Well, Okona is
an interesting man, certainly.

195
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,583
We've seen
how he handles his ship.

196
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,750
Apparently, he knows how
to handle people as well.

197
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,250
Then, why does he work alone?

198
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,333
He's a man who lives his life
by his own rules.

199
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,917
He does what he does by choice--

200
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,583
by his choice.

201
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,667
Someday, you'll make yours.

202
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,458
I already have.

203
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:48,083
So, you agree with Okona

204
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,125
that I am missing

205
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,667
a very important
human factor.

206
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,083
I never said that.

207
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,667
I simply said

208
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:55,375
that I've never
seen you laugh.

209
00:11:55,417 --> 00:12:00,375
I am capable of that function
when it is expected of me.

210
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:04,792
Data, do you even
know what a joke is?

211
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:06,542
Of course I do.

212
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,583
It is a witticism, a gag,
a<i> bon mot,</i> a fluctuation...

213
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,625
Stop.

214
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,834
Look, it's just you and I here.

215
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,709
We're talking, we're having
an intimate conversation.

216
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,083
Why?

217
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,500
Because you're a droid
and I'm a noid.

218
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:21,583
But why?

219
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,000
Because that's what I am.

220
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,917
Have I said something
to offend you?

221
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,333
No.

222
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,083
Then why are you annoyed?

223
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,250
Because you're a droid

224
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:36,917
and I'm<i> a noid.</i>

225
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,834
Humanoid.

226
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:39,834
Yes.

227
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,083
You told a joke?
Yes.

228
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,125
I am not laughing.

229
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,583
Yes!

230
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:47,083
Perhaps the joke was not funny.

231
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,709
No, the joke was funny.

232
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,208
It's you, Data.

233
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,166
Are you sure?

234
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,542
Yes.

235
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,083
I agree.

236
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,625
What do I do?

237
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,834
Well, under normal
circumstances

238
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,959
I'd say seek
a higher power.

239
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,125
But, in your case

240
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,959
probably a smarter
computer's in order.

241
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:15,000
Computer, I wish to know
more about humor.

242
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,041
Why certain combinations
of words and actions

243
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,834
make humans laugh.

244
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,792
Source material
on that subject is extensive.

245
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,333
Please specify.

246
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:29,083
Animated presentation,
humanoid, interaction required.

247
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,583
Physical humor, cerebral,
or general raconteur?

248
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:37,875
Of all performers available
who is considered funniest?

249
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,917
23rd century, Stano Riga.

250
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,166
Specialized in jokes
about quantum mathematics.

251
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,959
No, too esoteric.

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,417
More generic.

253
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,792
Accessing.

254
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,875
That one.

255
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,500
RW 96321.

256
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:58,667
20th century.

257
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,125
Program complete.

258
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,667
You may enter.

259
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:16,291
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

260
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,375
Thank you very much.
You've been great.

261
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:20,333
As a matter of fact, I'd like
to take you all home with me.

262
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,625
Unfortunately, I took
the last audience home

263
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:23,667
and there's no more room.

264
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:24,625
Ba-boom.

265
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:25,625
But thank you, really.

266
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:26,959
Thank you.

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,375
Hey, and thank you
for bringing me here.

268
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:29,709
What's up?

269
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,875
Mr. Comic, I wish to know
what is funny.

270
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:34,875
Funny? I don't know.

271
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,208
It's a matter of opinion
I guess, uh...

272
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,291
Tip O'Neill in a dress.

273
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,458
Some people say words
that end with a "k"

274
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,125
are funny.

275
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,709
A briefcase
that looks like a fish--

276
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,625
personally,
I find that hysterical.

277
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:51,500
Tip O'Neill-- accessing.

278
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:55,959
20th century male, politician,
overweight.

279
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,625
Wearing female clothing.

280
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,709
Carrying a valise
that looks like a fish.

281
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,125
So, the juxtaposition of gender
and an amphibian briefcase

282
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,750
is funny.

283
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:11,583
Well, I think whatever
makes you laugh is funny.

284
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,709
Nothing makes me laugh.
I wish to learn.

285
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,500
Well, how much time
do we have here?

286
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:21,792
Unlimited.

287
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,125
We're going to need it.

288
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,959
Because you, pal,
are a tough room.

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,959
Tough room?

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,959
Ah.

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,291
A colloquialism meaning

292
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,041
a severe, rigid,
close-minded audience.

293
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,250
I understand.

294
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,625
I will attempt to be
an easy room.

295
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,458
Show me what is funny.

296
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,458
All right, you're on.

297
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,750
Uh...

298
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:44,834
Jerry Lewis.
Jerry Lewis.

299
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,709
(<i> imitating Jerry Lewis):</i>
Haaa!

300
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,208
Ooh!

301
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,125
I'd be short for a moment
if I could just...

302
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,125
Say, I...

303
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,667
Oh! Ooh...

304
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,000
Mr. Robot, would you

305
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,041
like to come
up and try...

306
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,000
I am an android.

307
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,250
Oh, I'm terribly
sorry.

308
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,834
Mr. Android, here, here, teeth.

309
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:02,917
Put them in your mouth.

310
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,125
Come up, mister...

311
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,125
Where did he go?

312
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,000
Where did Mr....?

313
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,166
Here, try, if you would...

314
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,750
You do "haaa."

315
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,750
Haaa.
No, "ha-hiyee."

316
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,083
Ha-hiyee.
Eeeh!

317
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,291
Eeeh!

318
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,375
You go "hee!"
Hee!

319
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:20,875
Ya!

320
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,792
That is consider...

321
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,834
That is considered
to be funny?

322
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,333
Actually, it brought
the house down at Teaneck.

323
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,333
Ah, a word that
ends in a "k."

324
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,291
So, if you put funny
teeth in your mouth

325
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,250
and jump around
like an idiot

326
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,792
that is considered funny?

327
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,250
I'm sorry, I didn't
get your name.

328
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,667
Data.

329
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:46,917
Data, look, did you ever
consider, uh... juggling?

330
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,000
Weird birdcalls?
Something like that?

331
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,667
That does not apply.

332
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,709
I simply want to know
what is funny.

333
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,291
I want to involve myself
in other people's laughter.

334
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,291
I wish to join in.

335
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,000
Well, I think that's nice.

336
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,625
You know, let's put
the physical stuff

337
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:03,834
aside for awhile, all right?

338
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,542
And we'll do uh, uh...
some jokes.

339
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,750
You see, that's not my forte

340
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:07,917
but I think that would
work good for you.

341
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,417
If you would just have a seat

342
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,500
and we'll try some jokes.

343
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:12,709
Like, uh, I don't know--

344
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,125
we'll start
with the classics.

345
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,125
See, there's
this traveling
salesman, now

346
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,750
and he's going down the road
and his car breaks down.

347
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,959
Access faster.
He comes upon this farmhouse...

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,041
(<i> speaking very fast</i> ):
Now it's probably best
when you do something like this

349
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,125
is using a little cigar
because it's kind of a prop
kind of thing...

350
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,250
Faster.

351
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,709
Move to maximum speed.

352
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,250
(<i> speaking</i>
<i>at tape fast forward speed</i> )

353
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:41,917
A guy walks into
the doctor's office.

354
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,083
The doctor tells him,
"You need an operation."

355
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,083
The guy says, "I want
a second opinion."

356
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,875
The doctor says, "Okay,
you're ugly, too."

357
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,375
Ba-doom-boom.

358
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,500
Was I funny?

359
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,291
No.

360
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:02,792
Data...

361
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:05,875
you spoiled the joke.

362
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,750
It could have been
your timing.

363
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,792
My timing is digital.

364
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,750
What?

365
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,208
That's funny.

366
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,667
Why?

367
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:19,333
It would take
too long to explain.

368
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,041
Tell me another joke.

369
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:25,583
A monk, a clone and a Ferengi
decided to go bowling together.

370
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,750
PICARD:
Commander Data, report
to the Main Bridge immediately.

371
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,834
I will be back.

372
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,083
Bring new jokes.

373
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,041
WORF:
We have an "unidentified"
at 12 mark 4.

374
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,959
No response to our inquiries.

375
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,625
Extend hailing frequencies,
all languages, all channels.

376
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,417
Extending.

377
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,417
DATA:
Sensors show it to be
an interplanetary vessel, sir.

378
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,750
Class 7, crew complement 26.

379
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:03,417
WORF:
Still no
response.

380
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:29,125
Captain, they are now
locking lasers on us.

381
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,500
Lasers?
Yes, sir.

382
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:34,083
Lasers can't even penetrate
our navigation shields.

383
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,375
Don't they know that?

384
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:38,750
Regulations do call
for a yellow alert.

385
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:41,417
Hmm, very old regulation.

386
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,417
Well, make it so, Number One.

387
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,375
And reduce speed.

388
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,750
Drop main shields
as well.

389
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:49,959
May I ask why, sir?

390
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,625
In case we decide to surrender
to them, Number One.

391
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:59,041
(<i> disgruntled growl</i> )

392
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,166
Still no response to our hail,
sir.

393
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,250
It is slowing

394
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,709
and holding its
position, Captain.

395
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,917
Sir,<i> we</i> are now
being hailed.

396
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:18,000
Viewer on.

397
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,750
Federation vessel

398
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:24,083
you have no rights
in this solar system.

399
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,083
I am Debin of Planet Atlec

400
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:30,375
ordering you to heave to
and prepare to be boarded.

401
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,750
Shades of
<i>Gulliver's Travels.</i>

402
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,375
He actually meant it.

403
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:35,542
But he is right.

404
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:39,333
We are in their
solar system.

405
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,041
Open a channel.

406
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,542
Open, sir.

407
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:47,583
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

408
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,542
For what reason have you locked
your weapons on us?

409
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,792
<i>Enterprise,</i> you are towing
the spacecraft

410
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,375
of a known criminal.

411
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:58,667
He was in need
of emergency repair.

412
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:00,625
It was our obligation to assist.

413
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,542
You have a man aboard
by the name of Okona.

414
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,375
I want him.

415
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:07,417
On what authority?

416
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,792
He is guilty of crimes

417
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,583
committed on the planet Atlec.

418
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:15,542
I expect him to be turned over
to my authority immediately.

419
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,542
Mute.

420
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,417
What do you think, Counselor?

421
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,041
He believes what he's saying.

422
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,917
His anger is genuine.

423
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,333
Open.

424
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,625
What crimes are
you referring to?

425
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,959
That is neither important
nor necessary.

426
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I want Okona now!

427
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,834
Captain, we have another class 7
armed spacecraft approaching

428
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,375
from the opposite sector.

429
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,458
Another ship from Atlec?

430
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,166
Similar in
specifications
and capabilities

431
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,792
but a variation
in markings

432
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,542
and hailing language.

433
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,458
Debin, hold this position.

434
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,792
Viewer off.

435
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,166
Data, identify.

436
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,959
Sensors indicate it
is a security vessel

437
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,041
from the planet Straleb.

438
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,250
Another glob fly.

439
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,458
Glob fly?

440
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,333
DATA:
A Klingon fly

441
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,750
half the size
of an Earth mosquito

442
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:12,709
with no sting and
a buzzing sound like this...

443
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,417
Data, viewer on.

444
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,875
Hailing frequencies.

445
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,291
Open, sir.

446
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,959
I am Secretary Kushell

447
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,917
from the Legation of Unity
of the planet Straleb.

448
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,917
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

449
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,417
We know who you are,
Captain Picard.

450
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,250
We've been monitoring
your communications

451
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,500
and we know of the demands

452
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:34,458
made by Debin
of the planet Atlec.

453
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,792
Then you're aware

454
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,834
that we have no
hostile intention.

455
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,458
You only have to concede
to one demand.

456
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,834
That word "demand" has
a tone of finality.

457
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,792
It is a word I have chosen.

458
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:53,417
We<i> demand</i> that you turn
Okona over to us immediately.

459
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,166
Mute.

460
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:00,166
Mr. Okona, to the Bridge
immediately!

461
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,250
Open.

462
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,959
The same demand
has been made

463
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,667
by the Atlec legation.

464
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:09,709
I have no interest
in their request

465
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,291
but we intend to back up
our legal rights to Okona.

466
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:17,667
I would rather not escalate
this situation any further.

467
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:20,291
Our honor and prestige
are at stake!

468
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,250
We are prepared
to take Okona by force

469
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,875
and die in the doing of it
if necessary.

470
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:29,333
I trust
that that can be avoided.

471
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,125
I will respond
to your request shortly.

472
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,291
Viewer off.

473
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,709
Captain Okona has not
responded, sir.

474
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,917
He's been reported
in three different
crew quarters.

475
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,500
Find him, get him up here.

476
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:43,834
Yes, sir.

477
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,917
You will come with me
to the Main Bridge.

478
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:14,041
I'm sure it can wait
a few minutes.

479
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:18,917
Now!

480
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,750
I'd like that...

481
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,917
but I have my orders.

482
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:40,291
Some other time.

483
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,208
Remember what
it took

484
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,458
to drag me
from your arms.

485
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,792
Am I going to meet
Captain Picard?

486
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,000
(<i> chuckling</i> )

487
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,166
Definitely.

488
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:13,583
Did I say
something funny?

489
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:26,583
Captain Picard

490
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,500
<i>this</i> is Thadiun Okona.

491
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,542
Mr. Okona

492
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:35,750
you were welcomed
aboard

493
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:38,083
without any undue
investigation.

494
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,667
In turn, it was assumed

495
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,959
that you did not come
under false pretenses.

496
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,959
It now seems
that you may have done.

497
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,834
Captain, if you mean
my socializing with the members

498
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,875
of the crew...

499
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,709
Mr. Okona

500
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,834
you are free to socialize
with the members of my crew.

501
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:58,458
I'm talking about
a man named Debin.

502
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,417
He's from Atlec.

503
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,750
I've had dealings
with some of his family.

504
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:03,834
Then, perhaps
you can explain

505
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:06,500
why his craft is
threatening to attack us

506
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:07,917
unless I give him
custody of you.

507
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,125
I can't.

508
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,667
Then, tell me why Kushell
of the planet Straleb

509
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:16,041
is demanding the same thing.

510
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,458
He's here also?

511
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,667
Mm-hmm, and quite adamant.

512
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:25,458
Mr. Okona, what crimes
are you accused of?

513
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,041
I am not a criminal.

514
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,583
Why do these men want you?

515
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,250
I can't say.

516
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,792
They're threatening
to attack the<i> Enterprise.</i>

517
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,959
They would be crazy.
They wouldn't stand
a chance!

518
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,250
Right.

519
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:46,959
So you can offer no reason

520
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,667
why they are set
on this provocative course?

521
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,917
I can't think
of one right now.

522
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,917
On viewer.

523
00:26:58,959 --> 00:26:59,959
Which ship?

524
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,041
What?

525
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:05,083
Uh, the first one--
Captain Debin.

526
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,166
Captain, let me
ask you again.

527
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:10,542
What are
Okona's crimes?

528
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,542
That is not your concern.

529
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,875
It is if you wish me
to release him to you.

530
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:18,166
All right, you want
to know what he did?

531
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,709
You want to know why I have
chased him across this system?

532
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,709
All right, here--
this is his crime.

533
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,792
He dishonored my daughter.

534
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:32,709
He took advantage of her,
then he ran off and left her

535
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,208
carrying his
bastard child.

536
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,792
He'll return, and he'll
do the right thing

537
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:40,375
or I'll hunt him
to the ends of the galaxy.

538
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:47,250
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

539
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,375
<i>Some of the mystery surrounding</i>
<i>this ancient morality play</i>

540
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:52,667
<i>we've been dragged into</i>
<i>has been revealed.</i>

541
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:56,417
<i>One of Captain Okona's pursuers</i>
<i>is an outraged father</i>

542
00:27:56,458 --> 00:28:00,125
<i>with a heartfelt, if arcane,</i>
<i>sense of righteousness.</i>

543
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,000
Your advice, Counselor.

544
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:04,625
We are dealing
with ancient codes

545
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,542
involving procreation.

546
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:08,959
While they may appear
meaningless to us

547
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,333
to Debin, they
represent his honor.

548
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,542
He will fight, risking
himself, his crew

549
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:17,125
his daughter
and her unborn child.

550
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,875
You know, Captain,
your Counselor's right--

551
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:20,000
he will fight.

552
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,333
The Captain
of the other ship

553
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,041
is demanding to be heard.

554
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:26,166
I don't suppose you can give me
any indication

555
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,792
why<i> this</i> man wants you.

556
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

557
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,125
Let's put all this together.

558
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:38,667
Lieutenant Worf, multiple image,
full conference mode.

559
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:39,917
Let them all see each other.

560
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,959
Yes, sir.

561
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,250
Here you are, Debin

562
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,750
trying to save
this criminal.

563
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,208
My purpose is
not your concern.

564
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,333
It is if it
involves Okona.
Gentlemen.

565
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:55,458
Please, let's try
and resolve this matter.

566
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,875
Captain Kushell,
what crime has Okona

567
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:59,250
allegedly committed
against you?

568
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,709
He is a thief.

569
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,083
He stole the Jewel of Thesia,
a national heritage.

570
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,083
A thing, an item.

571
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,917
My case involves
the victimization

572
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,750
of my daughter
and my honor.

573
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,458
I'll have Okona now!

574
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,333
He is mine!

575
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,542
One at a time.

576
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,709
Who accuses me
of stealing?

577
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,959
I do.

578
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,542
My son, Benzan and I.

579
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:22,750
Father, please...

580
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,542
He used you
to become my friend.

581
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:26,000
He used my daughter!

582
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:29,000
He used my son to plunder
a national treasure!

583
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,583
Mute.

584
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:33,917
(<i> no audio</i> )

585
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,208
Terminate communications.

586
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,959
Come with me.

587
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,792
Captain, you can't
be afraid of those two

588
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:54,917
or what they can do
to your ship.

589
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,333
No.

590
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,000
They could fire
until their
lasers ran dry

591
00:29:58,041 --> 00:29:59,375
they wouldn't hurt the
<i>Enterprise.</i>

592
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:00,959
My predicament is
what to do with you.

593
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,291
I'm sorry.

594
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,834
I'm sorry my ship broke down.

595
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,083
I'm sorry
you stopped to help.

596
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,417
I'm sorry you're involved.

597
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,000
But you're right.
Whatever happens,

598
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:10,000
however it goes,
someone gets hurt.

599
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,875
Hand me over to Kushell
and Debin goes to war.

600
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:15,667
And if I hand you over to Debin,
it's the same thing.

601
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:18,083
I wish I could...

602
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,250
I wish I could
make it easier.

603
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:25,583
I'm sure you do.

604
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,959
I'm not going to apologize
for the way I am

605
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,709
or how I live my life

606
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,333
but, just for the record,
I did not steal

607
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,917
the Jewel of Thesia.

608
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,834
I am not a criminal, Captain.

609
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:42,750
And, as to the other business,
that's between me and Yanar.

610
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,500
No one else.

611
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:49,083
In truth, I simply do not
have authority in this matter.

612
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:53,792
I'm not your judge, nor
is it my duty to arbitrate.

613
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:57,625
But you are in my custody
and that creates the dilemma.

614
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,166
How about this?

615
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,667
Do what you said.

616
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:04,792
Fix my guidance system
and let me leave.

617
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:07,500
According
to Starfleet regulations

618
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:09,333
that would be
my only course of action.

619
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:12,333
But their ships
are faster than yours.

620
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,875
I'm not doing you a favor.

621
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:17,417
Captain, with all due respect,
that's not your concern.

622
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:21,959
Besides, I can
take care of myself.

623
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:35,291
You're quite
a craftsman

624
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,709
Lieutenant La Forge.

625
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,458
How soon?

626
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,875
What's the rush?

627
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:41,250
I thought you
liked it here.

628
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,375
I did.

629
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,375
It stopped liking me.

630
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,667
Time to disappear.

631
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,250
Where will you go?

632
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,208
What?

633
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,166
I said, where
will you go?

634
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:55,000
A new place,
if I make it.

635
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,083
Don't you ever
stay anywhere?

636
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,667
Not for long.

637
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,250
I couldn't be like that.

638
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:03,750
Oh?

639
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:06,250
I mean, always being alone.

640
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,125
Commander Riker says
you choose to live

641
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:09,875
the way you do,
and like it.

642
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:11,583
Is that what he says?

643
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:14,458
Yeah.

644
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,875
It would be difficult for me
to be leaving all the time.

645
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:22,959
I'd miss my friends,
the people I love.

646
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,583
I guess leaving's
gotten easy for you.

647
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,583
I seem to have a way
of using up a place.

648
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:33,625
I wasn't talking
about a place.

649
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:36,083
I know.

650
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,834
I know what you
were talking about.

651
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,542
LA FORGE:
It's ready.

652
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,250
You should be able
to install this

653
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:46,709
in roughly five minutes.

654
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,375
(<i> sighs</i> )

655
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:51,583
Like you said, Geordi,
what's the rush?

656
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:54,166
I have some friends
around here.

657
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,959
I think it's time
to make a stand.

658
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,583
Mr. Okona.

659
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:20,208
Captain, I've decided
not to leave.

660
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,542
Oh?

661
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,959
Don't worry,
I'm not staying, either.

662
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,750
Just what are
your plans, Mr. Okona?

663
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,083
I've decided
to surrender myself.

664
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,834
To which one?

665
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,375
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
There's really only one option.

666
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,291
Viewer on.

667
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:45,542
Gentlemen, communicating like
this is very distracting.

668
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:48,250
I suggest that we beam you
up to the<i> Enterprise</i>

669
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,500
and we'll resolve this
face-to-face.

670
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,041
Excellent.

671
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,667
Agreed.

672
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:55,500
RIKER:
Leave your weapons behind.

673
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:56,959
Let's keep this
civilized.

674
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,583
Number One,
you have the Bridge.

675
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,208
Counselor Troi,
would you accompany me

676
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,500
to Deck 14 Conference Room?

677
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,417
Worf, see to our guests.

678
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,291
Aye, sir.

679
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,542
They have no weapons.

680
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,041
This way.

681
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,500
Okona, you are
without shame.

682
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:44,583
For once, I agree
with Debin.

683
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,792
You<i> are</i> without shame.

684
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,166
I trusted you.

685
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:50,792
My son treated you
like a brother.

686
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:53,208
And then
to steal from us...

687
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,166
I want him<i> now.</i>

688
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:57,375
No, he's coming with me.

689
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:59,792
Captain, my complaint
was registered first.

690
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:02,750
Now, please.
Please be calm.

691
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:04,583
Lieutenant,
thank you.

692
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,625
Everyone is talking about me

693
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,792
and no one's talking<i> </i>
<i>to</i> me.

694
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,542
You all
believe

695
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,500
that I stole the jewel

696
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:21,083
and it was I who
fathered the child.

697
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:24,667
You dare call
my daughter a liar?

698
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:28,834
And now, I am offered
these two choices

699
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:31,333
and given these
two options--

700
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,917
condemnation as a thief

701
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:37,333
or marriage to the
beautiful Yanar.

702
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:41,917
I will take
the more pleasant sentence.

703
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,834
I will take Yanar

704
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,333
as my wife.

705
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,125
No, you can't.

706
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,291
My son is right!

707
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,750
You can't
escape that way.

708
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:50,959
That's not what I mean.

709
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,625
It's not up to you
nor to Okona.

710
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:55,333
I've been dishonored.

711
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,542
I will decide.

712
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:57,875
YANAR:
Wait.

713
00:35:57,917 --> 00:35:59,083
Since all of you believe

714
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,709
Okona is the father
of this child

715
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,417
then so be it.

716
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,250
I'll marry you.

717
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,625
BENZAN:
No.

718
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,875
You can't.

719
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:13,041
Yes, I can.

720
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,041
Okona is still
a thief.

721
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,208
No, he's not.

722
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,208
Nothing has
been stolen.

723
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,166
The Jewel of Thesia has been
taken into custody

724
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:26,834
by it's rightful heir,<i> me.</i>

725
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:30,166
I was to give it to Yanar
as our pledge of marriage.

726
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:32,208
Marriage?

727
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,333
Yanar is carrying my child.

728
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:41,417
Oh, you said it was Okona's.

729
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,917
If I told you it was Benzan

730
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:47,125
you would have gone
to war with his father.

731
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,792
So I let you believe
it was Okona.

732
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,875
See how a man
gets a reputation?

733
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:54,125
If I had told you
that I was giving the jewel

734
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:57,333
to Debin's daughter,
you'd have disowned me.

735
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,291
Now we're hearing some truth.

736
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:02,083
KUSHELL:
So, you let me
chase Okona

737
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,834
when you knew he was innocent.

738
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,709
Yes, because I didn't
believe for one moment

739
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,834
that you could catch him.

740
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,583
Well said.
He never would have.

741
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,500
And once Yanar
accepted the jewel

742
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,458
the marriage would
have been made.

743
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,333
Well, I never got it.

744
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,834
Then Okona does have the jewel.

745
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:24,542
I never had the chance
to deliver it.

746
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:25,875
Anyway, it's too late.

747
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,625
I won't marry Benzan.

748
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:29,583
Then you'll marry Okona.

749
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,667
I won't marry anyone.

750
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:39,375
I have reinstated
the same program.

751
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:41,250
Along with some
new jokes, I hope.

752
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:44,083
COMPUTER:
Program complete.
Enter when ready.

753
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,000
Comic, continue.

754
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,417
More freebies, huh?

755
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:00,625
No cover, no minimum?

756
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,583
Just "comic, continue"?

757
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,375
So tell me, Data,
what happened?

758
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,625
I told a joke.

759
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:07,542
And?

760
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:09,208
No one laughed.
No one?

761
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,417
Nobody in the
whole room?

762
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,875
I was the whole room.

763
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,750
She said I spoiled the joke.

764
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,750
Actually, "killed" would
have been a better word.

765
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:17,750
You know, Data,
I think I know what
your problem is.

766
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:18,750
You should
always try out

767
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,709
new material
on an audience.

768
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,917
You know, he could be right.

769
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:24,667
Perhaps an audience
is what you need.

770
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:32,417
Computer, program an audience
appropriate to this venue.

771
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,583
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

772
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,083
Yanar.

773
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:47,750
You're angry at the
embarrassment of all this

774
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,917
and maybe the timing
and the approach

775
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:52,583
is not the most
romantic,<i> but...</i>

776
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:56,333
I know you love Benzan

777
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,542
and I don't want to see you
throw away that feeling

778
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:01,750
just because your parents
have been quarreling for years

779
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:04,917
and don't know
how to behave properly.

780
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:10,041
I've carried your messages
back and forth

781
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,500
for almost six months.

782
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:13,375
I've smuggled each of you
into the other's homeland.

783
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:18,542
You feel for him
the same way he feels for you.

784
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,083
I do love you.

785
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,500
It is your child.

786
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:42,166
It's our child.

787
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:48,542
Marry me.

788
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:50,542
Yes.

789
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:51,875
(<i> whistles</i> )

790
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,667
We'll find a new
planet to live on.

00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:06,041
(<i> laughing</i> )

792
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,709
You'll live on Straleb.

793
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,250
No, no,
no, no.

794
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,333
You'll live

I will not have

796
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:16,041
this man raising
my grandson.

797
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,458
The rest of this is an issue,
gentlemen

798
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,083
to be settled
between yourselves.

799
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,125
Now, if you will excuse us,
we have business.

800
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,500
Thank you, Captain.

801
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:24,834
<i>Your</i> grandson?

802
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,917

My grandson.

(<i> drumroll</i> )

804
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:32,208
Thank you, thank you.

805
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,667
Thank you.
Thanks for coming, folks.

806
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:36,583
We got a great show
for you tonight.

807
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,583
I'm so excited this evening.

808
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:41,917
Tonight, I have for you
the funny man of the stars.

809
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:43,834
The android of antics.

810
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,250
That Lieutenant
Commander of mirth.

811
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:48,250
Please, give him a nice welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

812
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:51,333
None other than--
he's just the best--

813
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:52,291
Data.

(<i> cheering</i> )

815
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:05,166
Good evening,

(<i> drumroll</i> )

818
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:19,917
I come from a town so small

819
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:21,917
we had a fraction
for a zip code.

820
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:24,041
(<i> laughter</i> )

821
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:25,834
You made a living
doing this?

822
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,709
Yes, I did.

823
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,917
It was so small, in fact

824
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:31,166
we didn't have
a godfather of crime.

825
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:32,417
We had a nephew.

826
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,625
(<i> laughter</i> )

827
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:43,125
(<i> laughter</i> )

828
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:46,667
I was so ugly as a child

829
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:48,667
they hung a pork chop
around my neck...

830
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:52,041
(<i> laughter</i> )

831
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:56,458
so the dog would play with me.

832
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,667
(<i> laughter</i> )

833
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,709
And then there was
the human cannonball...

834
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,125
(<i> laughter</i> )

835
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:07,542
that was hired and fired
in the same night.

837
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:18,959

839
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:31,709
Discontinue comic.

840
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,709
It was a holodeck audience.

841
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:45,750
They were programmed
to laugh at everything.

842
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:48,583
Perhaps I should
reprogram the audience

843
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,709
to display
a more accurate response.

844
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,125
Data, let me give you one.

845
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:58,000
Being able to make people laugh
or being able to laugh

846
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:00,792
is not the end-all and be-all
of being human.

847
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:06,458
No, but there is nothing
more uniquely human.

848
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:24,083
Hold your speed,
Captain Okona.

849
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,709
Disengage.

850
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,709
Separated.

851
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,291
I'm under my own power, now.

852
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,000
Thank you,<i> Enterprise.</i>

853
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,875
Thank you, Captain Picard.

854
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:35,667
Good-bye, Captain Okona.

855
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:37,917
Bye, Captain Okona.

Ah, Burns and Allen.

Roxy Theater,
New York City, 1932.

It still works.

864
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:02,375
Then there was the one

about the girl
in the nudist colony

866
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,166
that nothing looked good on.
