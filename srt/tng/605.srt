00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:05,709
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46154.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,917
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has entered</i>
<i>the Amargosa Diaspora,</i>

3
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:11,417
<i>an unusually dense</i>
<i>globular cluster.</i>

4
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,250
<i>We are faced</i>
<i>with the daunting task</i>

5
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,959
<i>of charting this vast region.</i>

6
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:22,500
(<i> sighs</i> )

7
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,709
(<i> beeping</i> )

8
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,750
Lieutenant Shipley,
let's get a triangulation
on these sector points.

9
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,250
Aye, sir.

10
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

11
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry I'm late.
I overslept again.

12
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,542
What have we got?

13
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,375
Well, the cluster's
a lot more dense
than we thought.

14
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:16,333
It's going to take
three days just to
map out one-tenth of it.

15
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,959
Three days?

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,583
I think we found a way
to speed that up a bit.

17
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,583
We've been testing a way
to channel warp energy

18
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,667
directly to
the main deflector grid.

19
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,625
It should enhance
the long-range sensors.

20
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,625
The modification
would increase our
sensory efficiency

21
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:31,875
and imaging resolution
by 25% or more.

22
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,166
That sounds like
that'll use up a
lot of warp energy.

23
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,750
Well, we'd channel it
through the EPS mains

24
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,709
on Deck Four,
near Cargo Bay Four.

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,667
Okay,
let's give it a try.

26
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:44,709
Data, let's get those
field taps on-line.

27
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,250
Commander, I would
like to remind you

28
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,333
about my poetry reading
this afternoon.

29
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:55,458
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

30
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:04,959
I can't wait to see
what he's come up with.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,959
DATA:
"Then we sat on the sand
for some time and observed

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,917
"how the oceans that cover
the world were perturbed

33
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,750
"by the tides from
the orbiting moon overhead.

34
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:17,041
"'How relaxing the sound
of the waves is,' you said.

35
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,834
"I began to expound
upon tidal effects

36
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:23,333
"when you asked me to stop,
looking somewhat perplexed.

37
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,917
"So I did not explain
why the sunset turns red

38
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,500
and we watched
the occurrence...
in silence... instead."

39
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,417
That poem was written
in anapestic tetrameter.

40
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,917
For my ninth poem...

41
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,750
I don't understand.
I can barely keep
my eyes open.

42
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,959
DATA:
Throughout the ages,
from Keats to Jorkemo,

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,583
poets have composed
odes to individuals

44
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,834
who have had a profound
effect upon their lives.

45
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,125
In keeping
with that tradition,

46
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:01,208
I have written my next
poem in honor of my cat.

47
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,667
I call it "Ode to Spot."

48
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:10,500
<i>"Felis Catus is your</i>
<i>taxonomic nomenclature,</i>

49
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:15,417
"an endothermic quadruped,

57
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,166
"You would not be
so agile if you lacked
its counterbalance.

58
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,875
"And when not being utilized
to aid in locomotion,

59
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:52,875
"it often serves
to illustrate the state
of your emotion..."

60
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:58,291
Commander, you have
anticipated my denouement.

61
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,291
However, the sentiment
is appreciated.

62
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,625
I will continue.

63
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:08,959
"Oh, Spot,
the complex levels
of behavior you display

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,166
"connote a fairly
well-developed

65
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:17,458
"And though you are
not sentient, Spot,
and do not comprehend,

66
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,542
I, nonetheless,
consider you a true
and valued friend."

67
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,875
(<i> snoring</i> )

68
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:54,125
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

69
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:58,542
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

70
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

71
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,834
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

72
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:08,166
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

73
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:13,208
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

74
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,125
I have no problem
getting to sleep

75
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,041
and then I think
I'm sleeping all night.

76
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,500
When I wake up,
I feel exhausted.

77
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,375
How long has this
been going on?

78
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:19,625
Two, three days.

79
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,125
Do you have to hold
that thing that close?

80
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,166
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,792
I've been on edge
all day.

82
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,834
Well...

83
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,750
other than some muscle
tension in your neck,

84
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:37,083
I don't see anything
physically wrong with you.

85
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,792
Have you been
having bad dreams?

86
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:41,542
Not that I can remember.

87
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,792
This could be the result
of lack of REM sleep.

88
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,709
What do you recommend?

89
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,458
Drink this before
going to bed.

90
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,583
What is it?

91
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,041
A recipe for
a warm milk toddy.

92
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,750
A hot milk toddy?
You're kidding.

93
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:02,417
The heat activates the
amino acids in the lactose,
making it a natural sedative.

94
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,542
Besides, it's a recipe of
the captain's Aunt Adele.

95
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,000
It's delicious.

96
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,625
Well, at this point,
I'll try anything.

97
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,208
And listen, if it still
bothers you tomorrow,

98
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,000
come and see me, and
I'll run further tests.

99
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,500
Thanks.

100
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,959
Everything's in place.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,041
Warp grid couplers,
subspace field taps...

102
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,166
All right, let's do it.

103
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,208
Lieutenant Shipley,
initiate warp power transfer.

104
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,458
Aye, sir.

105
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,834
Verifying sensor
calibration.

106
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,208
EPS mains holding stable.

107
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,709
Sensor array on-line.

108
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,709
Come on, work.

109
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,000
Geordi?

110
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,667
Active scanner output
has increased by 26%.

111
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:51,375
Inform astrophysics
that the<i> new</i> La Forge
sensor array is on-line

112
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,333
and awaiting major
scientific discoveries.

113
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,583
Yes, sir.

114
00:07:55,625 --> 00:08:00,417
Geordi... may I make
a personal inquiry?

115
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,875
It concerns my
poetry reading.

116
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,583
Sure, Data, what is it?

117
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,834
I noticed
that many spectators

118
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,208
seemed distracted
during my presentation.

119
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,875
Was my poetry
uninteresting?

120
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,583
(<i> clears throat</i> )

121
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:17,792
Well, it was...
very well-constructed--

122
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:20,750
a virtual tribute to form.

123
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,875
Thank you.

124
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,834
And?

125
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,500
And what?

126
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,417
Did it evoke
an emotional response?

127
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well...

129
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,166
Your hesitation suggests
you are trying to
protect my feelings.

130
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,917
However, since I
have none, I would
prefer you to be honest.

131
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,583
An artist's growth depends
upon accurate feedback.

132
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,959
Well, your-- your poems
were... clever, Data.

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,208
And-- and your haiku
was clever.

134
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,458
And your sonnet was...

135
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,333
clever.

136
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:04,166
But did it evoke
an emotional response?

137
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:08,542
Ah, to be honest,
no, I don't think so.

138
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,834
Hmm.

139
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,417
Then I did not succeed
in my efforts.

140
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,959
No, it's not that
you didn't succeed.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,583
You accomplished
a lot, but...

142
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,583
if you want to
touch people,

143
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,625
don't concentrate so
much on rhyme and meter.

144
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,291
Think more about
<i>what</i> you want to say

145
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,375
instead of how
you're saying it.

146
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,917
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

147
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,000
It's the power grid
warning.

148
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,083
I am reading
a massive EPS explosion.

149
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,166
Where?

150
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,458
I am attempting
to localize it.

151
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,083
It is Cargo Bay Four.

152
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,166
I've got three people
in there.

153
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,041
Damage control, medical
team to Cargo Bay Four.

154
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,208
Let's go.

155
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:00,208
The field imbalance
has subsided.

156
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,333
There may still be
a residual discharge.

157
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,333
Stand clear.

158
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,375
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

159
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:23,834
Is there something
wrong, sir?

160
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,875
And there's no evidence
of an EPS explosion.

161
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:30,792
The sensors seemed
to think there was.

162
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:33,041
I think my modification
to the sensor array

163
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,166
may have caused a pattern
recognition failure.

164
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,417
Just a sensor glitch?

165
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,875
That's my guess.

166
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,333
(<i> sighs</i> )

167
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,750
Let's perform a
level-3 diagnostic

168
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:44,500
on the internal sensor
network and make sure

169
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,250
that we haven't
overlooked anything.
Aye, sir.

170
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,125
And could we pick this up
in the morning, Geordi?

171
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,917
Get a fresh start?

172
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,166
Would you do me a favor?

173
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,834
Stop by my quarters,
0700 hours.

174
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,417
I'm having trouble
waking up.

175
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,458
Sure, Commander.

176
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,458
Good night.

177
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,583
Good night.

178
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

179
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,458
(<i> grunts</i> )

180
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,166
Commander.
Gordon.

181
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,208
Who is it?

182
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,375
It's La Forge.

183
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,250
Come in.

184
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,125
Good morning.

185
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,542
Morning?
I just went to bed.

186
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,875
Commander,
it's 0700 hours.

187
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,542
And so she said,
"if they're not squirming,
we won't eat 'em."

188
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,917
(<i> laughing</i> )

189
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,375
Ah, Mr. Worf,
my good Klingon.

190
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,291
Sir, welcome.

191
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:46,625
What a pleasure it is
to have you back
with us again so soon.

192
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:50,375
So, Lieutenant,
a haircut today?

193
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:51,458
Trim your beard?

194
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,250
I would like
my hair trimmed.

195
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,792
Ah, a trim.
Of course.

196
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,000
Not like last time.

197
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,583
Oh, no. Just
a little off the top.

198
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,583
I took<i> way</i> too much
off last time.

199
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:09,750
Um, I was just telling
my colleague, Mr. Setti,

200
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:13,709
how thick and luxuriant
Klingon hair is.

201
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,208
It's such
a pleasure to cut,

202
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,083
sometimes I
get carried away.

203
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,667
You know, all those
away missions--

204
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,834
wind and-- and dry air.

205
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,500
The elements really
are harsh on the hair.

206
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:30,625
I'd like to suggest
that you start using
a conditioning agent.

207
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:44,208
I... I promise...
not too much off the top.

208
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,208
Just before
the grid alarm sounded,

209
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,750
we were running warp power
through this junction.

210
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:08,083
Somehow, it must have tripped
the internal scanners.

211
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,125
And it showed up as
an EPS explosion?

212
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,834
Yes, but
the question is, why?

213
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,250
I've made modifications
to the sensors before,

214
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,375
but nothing like<i> this</i>
has ever happened.

215
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:20,709
Well, we can't waste our
time chasing sensor ghosts.

216
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,417
We should probably keep
the whole array off-line

217
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,750
until you can get
a closer look.

218
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:24,875
(<i> yawning</i> )

219
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,083
Oh, excuse me.

220
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,125
I know the feeling.

221
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,417
The past few nights,
it seems like

222
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,750
as soon as my head
hits the pillow,

223
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,208
it's time to get up
in the morning.

224
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,834
I'm sure we could all use
a little shore leave

225
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,208
once this survey
is completed.

226
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,709
Definitely.
Keep me posted?

227
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,166
Yeah. Data?

228
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,834
I'm wondering if you
could give me a hand.

229
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,667
I need to run a structural
integrity scan.

230
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:46,208
I want to make sure that
none of the conduit was...

231
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,417
Ooh...
What is it?

232
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,250
(<i> sighs</i> )

233
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,041
This is
the second time today

234
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,375
that my visor has just
cut out like that.

235
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,041
Are you all
right, Geordi?

236
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,875
I don't know.

237
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:07,625
I just got
a very weird feeling.

238
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,333
Maybe I should go
to sick bay.

239
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,125
I will run the
integrity scan.

240
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,208
Thanks, Data.

241
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,542
CRUSHER:
This is curious.

242
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:25,583
There's a slight
bacterial infection
around your neural inputs.

243
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,250
It was probably
interrupting
the data stream.

244
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,166
An infection?
What from?

245
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:34,959
It doesn't match
any bacterial
strains on record.

246
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,542
I'm going to have to
sterilize the area,

247
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,750
but I need to run a
resonance tissue scan

248
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:44,500
to search for any signs
of additional infection.

249
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:46,709
Come over here.

250
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:55,583
Sit down.

251
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,166
Now, come forward.

252
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:10,041
Now, you're going to
need to hold very still.

253
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,542
How's the scan
going, Data?

254
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,917
I have just
started the scan.

255
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,375
Did you not go
to sick bay?

256
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,375
Data, I've been there
for over an hour and a half.

257
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,875
That is not possible.

258
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:29,041
My internal chronometer
indicates you have been gone

259
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,166
for exactly
one minute, 15 seconds.

260
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,458
Well, I'm
telling you, Data,

261
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,750
I've been gone
for over an hour.

262
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,709
Computer, what is
the time, please?

263
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,041
The time is 14:27 hours.

264
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,041
<i>You</i> are correct.

265
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,250
90 minutes, 17 seconds
have passed since
you left the room.

266
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,041
What have you been doing
all this time?

267
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,750
I have no memory of events
during that period.

268
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,625
When we have finished
here, I will perform
a self-diagnostic.

269
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,166
You know, first we
picked up a false
EPS explosion,

270
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:01,875
then my visor cuts out twice
and now, you lose an hour,
all in this cargo bay.

271
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:05,333
La Forge to engineering.
I want a diagnostic team to
Cargo Bay Four immediately.

272
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,417
On our way, sir.

273
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:12,166
Ensign Rager, cartography
needs a better position
to study cluster FGC-13.

274
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,500
Bring us about,
heading 123 mark four.

275
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:17,583
Aye, sir.

276
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:21,917
Helm won't lock to
those coordinates, sir.

277
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,625
First time navigating
through a globular
cluster, Ensign?

278
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:32,375
You have to compensate
for the gravimetric
interference before...

279
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,166
Is there something
wrong, sir?

280
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,709
No.

281
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,458
I don't know.

282
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,625
Put us back on our
original heading, Ensign.

283
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,834
Don't tell me...

284
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,875
This can't be right.

285
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,542
Data...

286
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,208
come here and take a
look at this, would you?

287
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:13,542
I think we have
another sensor glitch.

288
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,000
Sensors are
functioning normally.

289
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,542
They are detecting a
subspace particle emission

290
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,291
originating
from within this room.

291
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,166
From within this room?
That's impossible.

292
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,166
The emission is emanating
from this direction.

293
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,917
Geordi...

294
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,667
DATA:
the structure
of the bulkhead

295
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:59,625
has been altered
on a subatomic level.

296
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:02,750
The metal itself
is in a state of
quasi-molecular flux.

297
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,250
What's causing it?

298
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,291
Well, this is where it
gets a little wild, Captain.

299
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,750
Behind that panel
is a junction
that we were using

300
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:11,583
to transfer warp power
to the sensor array.

301
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,166
We're reading a
subspace particle stream

302
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,208
emanating from
that junction.

303
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,500
It appears to be composed
of spatially inverted
tetryon particles.

304
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,834
We believe they
are emanating

305
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,125
from a tertiary
subspace manifold.

306
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,333
But I thought that
tetryons were unstable
in normal space.

307
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,750
We don't understand it
either, sir.

308
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,000
Something from
that deep in subspace

309
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,125
shouldn't be able to
exist in our universe,

310
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,333
but there it is.

311
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,208
Does it pose a danger
to the ship?

312
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,625
Not unless it spreads.

313
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,625
If it does, we can beam
the bulkhead into space

314
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:42,333
and erect a force field
in its place.

315
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,750
Well, keep
that option ready.

316
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,875
In the meantime,
proceed with the analysis.

317
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,959
Aye, sir.

318
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:53,250
When I sat at the console,
it triggered a response
like I'd been trapped.

319
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,917
I had to get
out of there.

320
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,333
Was it something about
the console itself?

321
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:01,667
No. I felt like
I was disconnected,

322
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:05,291
like it was something
that I had dreamed.

323
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:09,875
You're the third person
who's come to me today
with something like this--

324
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,542
an intense emotional
response provoked by
an object.

325
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,000
Did any of them
know why they had
had the response?

326
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,625
No. They couldn't
explain it any more
than you could.

327
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:22,041
You know, at this point
I'm not willing to say
it's coincidence.

328
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,500
Maybe we should all
get together.

329
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:29,375
Well, talking about it
would help you
understand your response.

330
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:31,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

331
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,250
I'm going to find out
if anyone else on the ship

332
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,250
has had these kind
of experiences.

333
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,291
Will, you told me you
had an unusual experience

334
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,834
when you sat down
at the console.

335
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,500
Why don't you
describe it?

336
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:56,166
It was vague, the way
you recall a dream.

337
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,500
I remember
the sensation
of feeling trapped

338
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:03,250
and something about
a-- a smooth surface.

339
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:08,667
I had a similar response,
but to a pair of scissors.

340
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:11,166
Have you dreamt
about scissors recently?

341
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,917
I may have. I have
no distinct memory of it.

342
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:18,166
When my visor cut out
in the cargo bay, I had
a weird feeling, too.

343
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,917
It was something
about a smooth surface.

344
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:25,500
It was smooth...
and cold.

345
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,834
Yeah, it was cold.

346
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,959
Yes. Cold.

347
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,750
It was... elevated?

348
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,625
A platform.

349
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:37,834
Right.

350
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,875
Like a bench.

351
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,417
Or a table.

352
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:49,333
It seems you've all had
a similar experience.

353
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,959
Is there anything
else you remember
besides a table?

354
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,208
(<i> sighs</i> )

355
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:05,208
Maybe there's a way
we can all help ourselves
to remember more.

356
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:15,625
TROI:
Well, you all
remember a table,
so let's start with that.

357
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,625
Computer,
show me a table.

358
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:22,041
There are 5,047
classifications
of tables on file.

359
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,583
Specify
design parameters.

360
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,959
Can you be more specific
about the table?

361
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,542
You mentioned it
was smooth and cold.

362
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,250
Can you remember
what shape it was?

363
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,625
Long.

364
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:34,917
It was long.

365
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah, and it had
a rectangular shape.

366
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:43,834
Computer, show me
a rectangular
conference table.

367
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,583
It's too high.

368
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:10,166
Computer, reduce the height
of the table by 25%.

369
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:16,166
No. The table was smaller
and it was inclined.

370
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:21,166
Computer, decrease the
table's surface area by 20%

371
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,417
and incline
the top 15 degrees.

372
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:28,250
No. It wasn't
made of wood.

373
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,250
It was smoother,
more metallic.

374
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,750
Computer, make this
a metal table.

375
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,750
Yeah.

376
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,709
Yeah, that's starting
to look right.

377
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,500
Was there anything else
in the room?

378
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:46,917
Furniture?
Chairs? A door?

379
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,375
Other people?

380
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:51,375
No.
It was dark.

381
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:53,125
RIKER:
Yes, it was dark.

382
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,417
You couldn't see
beyond the table.

383
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,917
Computer, lower the
surrounding light level.

384
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,792
LA FORGE:
There was a light
right in my face--

385
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,542
a bright light.

386
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:14,166
Computer, give me
a bright light right
above the table.

387
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,291
Specify light source.

388
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:20,959
I couldn't tell.
I-- it was above me.

389
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,125
An overhead lamp.

390
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,208
Estimated distance
of light source?

391
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,125
I don't know.

392
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:31,250
It was at least two
or three meters above.

393
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,083
Brighter.

394
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,458
Brighter.

395
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:51,583
You said you were uneasy
when you sat down
at the conn position.

396
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:57,208
Yes. I felt trapped
by the console.

397
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,709
But it wasn't like this.

398
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,500
There was
something else here.

399
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:07,083
A restraint of some kind?

400
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,458
Yes, there was
a restraint.

401
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,041
It was flat, metal.

402
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,709
It was made of metal.

403
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,500
It came down over my legs.

404
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:20,917
No, no, it... no.

405
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,917
It was... it was
across my chest.

406
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,291
It was right here.

407
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,709
It was holding you down?

408
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,041
Yes. It was part
of the table.

409
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,291
It was here.
It was right here.

410
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:35,542
Computer, create
a restraining arm

411
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:39,959
attached to the
right side of the
table at the midpoint.

412
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,542
TROI:
Was it like that?

413
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:50,500
Computer, put controls
on the restraining arm,

414
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:53,333
a control panel,
lights.

415
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:58,709
WOMAN:
There was something
else there,

416
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,291
over the head
of the table.

417
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,083
A metal swing arm.

418
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,709
Computer, create
a metal swing arm,

419
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,125
double-jointed,
total length one meter.

420
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:15,291
Connect it
to the head of the table.

421
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,333
WORF:
There was something
attached to it--

422
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,959
a tool of some sort.

423
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,583
Scissor-like.

424
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:29,667
Computer, produce
a pair of scissors
attached to the armature.

425
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:37,041
The handle is wrong.
It was not scissors.

426
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:40,959
Computer, make the handle
a single-piece grip

427
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,709
ten centimeters long,
solid metal.

428
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,083
Now make one blade longer,
curved inward...

429
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,542
and give the other blade
a jagged edge.

430
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,083
TROI:
All right.

431
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:03,917
You were lying
on the table.

432
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:08,333
You had a bright light
shining in your eyes.

433
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:12,458
Were there any smells
in the room?

434
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,291
Were there any sounds?

435
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:18,959
Yes. Yes,
there was a sound.

436
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

437
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:26,000
Computer, there were noises
coming from the darkness.

438
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,500
Strange...

439
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:31,208
like whispering.

440
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,458
(<i> low whispering</i> )

441
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,875
More like clicks.

442
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,375
Clicking sounds.

443
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:40,041
(<i> clicking</i> )

444
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,375
Louder.

445
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:43,083
(<i> louder clicking</i> )

446
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,375
RIKER:
Faster.

447
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:45,375
(<i> faster clicking</i> )

448
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:48,250
RIKER:
More of them.

449
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:52,250
I've been in
this room before.

450
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:56,208
We've all been here
before.

451
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,625
CRUSHER:
Here it is again.

452
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,458
Something has caused
high levels of serotonin

453
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,166
to be produced in
Geordi's visual cortex.

454
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,208
When I examined
him earlier today,

455
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,583
I thought it was the result
of a bacterial infection,

456
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,959
but now I'm finding the
same thing in all three.

457
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,917
They all have elevated
levels of serotonin.

458
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,959
It's concentrated
in the hippocampus,

459
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,792
which suggests that
they've been exposed
to a neuro-sedative.

460
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:29,000
And that's not all.
I have detected

461
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:33,000
minute tetryon
particle traces in
their subdermal tissues.

462
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,542
Tetryons?

463
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,875
Like the emissions
in the cargo bay.

464
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,375
I have completed
my self-diagnostic

465
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:44,250
and have confirmed
that I was not aboard
the<i> Enterprise</i>

466
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,917
for 90 minutes, 17 seconds
yesterday afternoon.

467
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:47,959
Are you sure?

468
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,166
Whenever I am
on the ship,

469
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,792
the warp field leaves
an electromagnetic signal

470
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:55,166
on my internal
servo fluid system.

471
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:59,250
Between the period
of 1254 to 1426 hours,

472
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,959
that signature is missing.

473
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:07,917
Computer, are there
any members of the crew
of the<i> Enterprise</i> missing?

474
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:10,834
There are two crew members
unaccounted for.

475
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,959
PICARD:
Identify them.

476
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,792
Lieutenant Edward Hagler
and Ensign Sariel Rager.

477
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,333
When did they leave?

478
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:23,417
They have not been present
since 23:32 hours.

479
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,959
PICARD:
How did they leave?

480
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,166
Method of departure
unknown.

481
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,208
Picard to bridge.

482
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,625
Bridge here, Captain.

483
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,083
Raise shields.

484
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,458
And I want a level-4
security alert.

485
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,000
I need to know if anyone
comes on or off this ship.

486
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,458
Aye, sir.

487
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,750
Mr. La Forge, Mr. Data,
I believe that if we find

488
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:42,709
the source of those
tetryon emissions,

489
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,875
we'll find the
missing crew members.

490
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:47,375
We're on it, sir.

491
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:49,750
Dr. Crusher?

492
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,417
My God!
What is it?

493
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:01,834
It looks as though your
arm has been severed
and then reattached.

494
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:04,333
What?!

495
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:12,166
The skeletal structure
in your radius and ulna
is offset by .02 microns.

496
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:16,709
Your arm has been amputated
and surgically reattached.

497
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,625
Any progress with
the analysis, Lieutenant?

498
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,750
Look at this.

499
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:48,500
Data, the tetryon emissions
have intensified.

500
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:53,000
They seem to be focusing
in this direction...

501
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:56,500
coalescing here.

502
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:58,750
They're reading as a
point of subspace energy.

503
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:02,750
It appears to be
the beginnings of
a spatial rupture.

504
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:06,917
Yeah, the tetryon
emissions are modulating

505
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:09,917
in a way that...
that looks like

506
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:13,792
somebody is
controlling the energy.

507
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:16,709
You know...

508
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,041
the signals from the
modifications I made
to the sensor array--

509
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,458
some of them dipped
pretty deep into subspace.

510
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,750
Maybe they caught
somebody's attention.

511
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:27,917
At the rate the
rupture is expanding,

512
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,917
we will soon be in
danger of hull breach.

513
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,291
Maybe we should try
surrounding it

514
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,834
with a subspace
containment field.

515
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,542
Other than the
tetryon emissions
in Cargo Bay Four,

516
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,041
our internal sensors
haven't recorded

517
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,208
anything unusual in
the past three days.

518
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,041
Initiate a metallurgical
analysis of the ship's hull.

519
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:46,000
Subspace field incursions
may have left a trace.

520
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:49,208
Captain, sensors indicate
that Lieutenant Hagler

521
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,083
has returned to
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

522
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:56,375
He is in his quarters--
Deck Nine, Section 17.

523
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:08,709
Computer, emergency entry,
Chief Medical Officer
Beverly Crusher.

524
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,709
(<i> wheezing</i> )

525
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:21,667
Crusher to sick bay.

526
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:26,959
Get me a plasma
infusion unit to
Deck Nine, Section 19.

527
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,959
His blood is turning
into a liquid polymer.

528
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,917
(<i> groans softly</i> )

529
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,125
We've set up a containment
field in Cargo Bay Four

530
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:45,583
but the rupture
just keeps expanding.

531
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,834
I'd say we've got another
five to six hours before
it breaches the hull.

532
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,875
Can we still beam
the affected sections
out into space?

533
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:53,709
No, sir.
The spatial rupture

534
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,667
is creating severe
nucleonic interference.

535
00:32:56,709 --> 00:33:00,667
It is impossible to
obtain a positive lock
on the bulkheads.

536
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:09,542
Has your analysis suggested
any way in which we might
<i>seal</i> this rupture?

537
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,542
LA FORGE:
We think we can close
the rupture

538
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,250
by neutralizing
the tetryon emissions

539
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,250
with a coherent
graviton pulse,

540
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:17,166
but we'd have to do
that at the source.

541
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:19,709
How do we find
the source?
Good question.

542
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:23,625
The emissions are
coming from a tertiary
subspace domain

543
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,166
but subspace has an
infinite number of domains.

544
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:29,333
It's like a huge
honeycomb with an
infinite number of cells.

545
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,709
We need to isolate
the exact cell

546
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,333
that these emissions
are coming from.

547
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:37,709
If someone homed onto
the subspace signals

548
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,291
created by our
modified signal array,

549
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,417
could we do the same
to them?

550
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:46,583
Track the tetryon emissions
to<i> their</i> universe?

551
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,792
Tetryon particles
have a random momentum.

552
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:52,125
Our sensors
cannot track them, sir.

553
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:56,458
Perhaps we could construct
a homing device--

554
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,667
something that our sensors
<i>could</i> track.

555
00:33:58,709 --> 00:33:59,917
It's a good idea,
but there's no way

556
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,667
to get that device
to the source.

557
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:05,250
Yes, there is.
Give it to me.

558
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,000
They've taken me for
the last few nights.

559
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:10,333
And if I'm right,
the same thing
will happen tonight.

560
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,875
Well, if you had
a homing device,
we could track it

561
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,875
to your location
in subspace.

562
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:16,166
Then as soon as they
send you back to the ship,

563
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,750
we could transmit
the graviton pulse

564
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,208
and neutralize
the tetryon emissions.

565
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,834
<i>If</i> they send him back.

566
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,458
Ensign Rager still
hasn't been returned.

567
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,959
They're going to
take me whether I
want to go or not.

568
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,166
Well, we could wait
as long as possible

569
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,875
for you to be returned,
Number One.

570
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:33,917
But when the spatial
ruptures begin to
threaten the ship,

571
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:36,750
then we would
have to transmit
that graviton pulse.

572
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:38,542
Understood.

573
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:43,625
Perhaps there's...
a way that we could
give you an advantage.

574
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:48,208
A way of keeping
you conscious after
they've taken you.

575
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,667
Doctor, can you develop
some counteragent

576
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:54,083
to the neuro-sedative
that they have been
giving the crew?

577
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:59,542
I could give you
a neuro-stimulant,

578
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:03,333
but the dosage would
have to be rather high
to counteract the effects.

579
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,041
It could be risky.

580
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,166
I'm willing to take
that risk.

581
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:09,709
Make it so.

582
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,834
Mr. La Forge, begin work
on that homing device.

583
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:21,333
This should ward off
their neuro-sedative
for about 12 hours.

584
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:23,625
I hope it's enough.

585
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:24,875
It's going to
have to be.

586
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,667
I can't risk giving
you a higher dosage.

587
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:32,333
I've locked this tricorder
into a continuous cycle.

588
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:35,208
That way, it'll keep
recording, whether
you open it or not.

589
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,583
Hopefully,
you can bring back

590
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,792
some information
about their domain.

591
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:42,333
We've modified a sensor
relay emitter to transmit
a subspace beacon.

592
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,125
When this indicator
lights up,

593
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:46,000
it means that we've
locked onto your location.

594
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:48,166
Understood.

Captain, Commander
Riker has been taken

602
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,917
Mr. La Forge, report.

603
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:11,083
I still can't locate
the homing signal.

604
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,667
We've covered the entire
upper-subspace energy band.

605
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:17,083
We're extending the scan
to adjacent levels.

606
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,000
Mr. Data, your status?

607
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:22,125
The rupture has
expanded another 4.2%.

608
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,959
Without further reinforcement,
containment field integrity

609
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,542
will fail in
approximately 14 minutes.

610
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,834
Can you divert more power
to the containment field?

611
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,417
I can try
to augment the field

612
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:34,291
with auxiliary power,
but it won't be much.

613
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,333
Make it so.

614
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:36,750
Aye, sir.

615
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:41,834
(<i> clicking</i> )

616
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,417
(<i> clicking continues</i> )

617
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:22,208
Captain, I've located
the homing signal.

618
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,500
Locking onto it now.

619
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:28,625
It's coming from a subspace
energy level of 16.2 KEV.

620
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,917
Stand by to initiate
the graviton pulse.

621
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,792
Graviton emitter's
at full power, sir.

622
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:33,834
Standing by.

623
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:35,291
Mr. Data, how much time?

624
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,291
At the present rate,
containment failure

625
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,875
will occur in
approximately nine minutes.

626
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:47,291
(<i> clicking</i> )

627
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:59,750
Captain, the
containment field is
beginning to fluctuate.

628
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:03,125
Failure anticipated
in three minutes,
11 seconds.

629
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:04,834
We can't afford to
wait any longer.

630
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:08,208
Begin the graviton pulse.

631
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,166
Initiating pulse now.

632
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:17,625
(<i> rapid, intense clicking</i> )

633
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,417
Data to engineering.

634
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,542
The graviton pulse
is having an effect.

635
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:28,500
Tetryon emissions
have decreased by 19%.

636
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,875
Captain, additional
subharmonics have appeared.

637
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:36,333
They are reinforcing
the tetryon emissions.

638
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:39,542
They appear to
be counteracting
the graviton pulse.

639
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:42,125
The rupture is beginning
to expand again, sir.

640
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:45,083
It looks like somebody
is fighting back.

641
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,458
Can you strengthen
the graviton pulse?

642
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,834
I can try to set up
a random frequency shift.

643
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:52,041
If we can keep them
from guessing our
pulse modulation,

644
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,583
they might not be
able to compensate.

645
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:57,792
(<i> clicking</i> )

646
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,166
Tetryon emissions
continue to increase.

647
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,458
The rupture
is still expanding.

648
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,083
Hull breach is imminent.

649
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:15,750
They're reacting
faster than we can
shift frequencies.

650
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:17,959
Shipley,
program the emitters

651
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,959
for full-spectrum
pulse compression.

652
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I want to channel all
of the graviton energy
into a single burst.

653
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,417
Let's see if they
can handle<i> that.</i>

654
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,750
Ready, Commander.

The rupture is
beginning to close, sir.

658
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,792
Recharge the emitters.
Let's hit them again.

659
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:46,792
Come on.

660
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:48,333
Ready.

661
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:06,583
DATA:
The rupture is 86% closed.

662
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:07,667
We're almost there.

663
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:08,959
One more burst
should do it.

664
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,125
Emitters recharging.

665
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,417
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46191.2.</i>

666
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:46,250
<i>The tetryon emissions</i>
<i>in Cargo Bay Four have ceased</i>

667
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:49,709
<i>and there have been</i>
<i>no further indications</i>
<i>of alien intrusions.</i>

668
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,166
<i>All</i> Enterprise<i> crew members</i>
<i>are safe and accounted for,</i>

669
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:56,959
<i>but we are still left with</i>
<i>some unanswered questions.</i>

670
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,208
Based on the
information gathered

671
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,041
from Commander Riker's
tricorder,

672
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,417
we have determined
that the molecular structure

673
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,792
of the alien life-forms
is solanagen-based.

674
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:06,500
We think that's why
they couldn't come through

675
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,417
into<i> our</i> space as
easily as they could
take us into theirs.

676
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:12,291
They needed to learn
how to remodulate their
cellular energy states

677
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,083
in order to survive
in our universe.

678
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,083
The tricorder readings
indicate they created
a small pocket

679
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,917
of our universe
in their laboratory

680
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:21,417
to keep those
they abducted alive.

681
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:24,250
Like putting a fish
in a bucket of water.

682
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:26,667
It's probably what
they were trying to do
in Cargo Bay Four--

683
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:28,959
create a pocket of
their universe in ours.

684
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,750
What can we do to prevent
this from happening again?

685
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,750
Looks like they
found us initially

686
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:36,125
by discovering my
modified sensor signal.

687
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:39,417
We should warn all
starfleet ships not
to make that same mistake.

688
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:41,875
Have we any idea
what came through
the rupture

689
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:43,792
before we were able
to shut it down?

690
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:47,542
No, sir. We were unable to track
it once it left the cargo bay.

691
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,792
Maybe it was a probe
of some kind.

692
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:52,083
Possibly they
were simply curious--

693
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:55,500
explorers like ourselves.

694
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:58,709
Ensign Rager and I were
lucky to have escaped.

695
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,125
Lieutenant Hagler's dead.

696
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:06,583
Whoever it was sent
that thing was more
than simply curious.
