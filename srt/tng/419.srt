1
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:06,959
You were like
a brother to me.

2
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:08,375
Do you remember?

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,375
We used to play
in the park near the lake.

4
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,083
Yes, of course.

5
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:15,667
Every summer
you would come to Bergerac.

6
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,709
You used to make swords
out of the reeds.

7
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:20,500
And when you cut your hand,
you would come running to me

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,709
and I would say,
"Let me see."

9
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:25,750
Oh, how did you do that?

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,166
Playing near
the Porte de Nesle.

11
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,333
CRUSHER:
And how many did you
play against?

12
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,291
No more than 100.

13
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,208
Tell me.

14
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,291
No.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,625
(<i> whispering</i> )
Let it go.

16
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,333
(<i> whispering</i> )
What?

17
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,667
(<i> whispering</i> )
Let it go.

18
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:49,291
Oh!
Let it go.

19
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,667
Let... let it go.

20
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,000
You...

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,041
you tell me what
you were going to say.

22
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,250
Do you dare?

23
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,542
CRUSHER:
I do dare.

24
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:01,750
I love someone.

25
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,792
Ah.

26
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:04,583
He does not know.

27
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,750
Ah.
Not yet.

28
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,667
But he is proud, noble,

29
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,458
brave and beautiful.

30
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,500
(<i> wretchedly</i> )
Oh, beautiful.

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
What's the matter?
With me? Nothing.

32
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,417
It is my hand.

33
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:18,917
He is in the guards?

34
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:20,375
Since this morning.

35
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,959
Baron Christian
de Neuvillette

36
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,875
in your own regiment.

37
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,125
Ah.

38
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,792
Promise me...

39
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:30,083
promise me
to be his friend.

40
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,333
I promise.

41
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,834
Oh, I love you.

42
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:38,208
I must go now.

43
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,208
Oh, and tell him to write me.

44
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:46,875
100 men--
what courage!

45
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,750
Oh, but I...

46
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,375
I ha-- I have done
better since.

47
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,458
(<i> polite applause</i> )

48
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,458
Bravo!

49
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,542
Wonderful, wonderful.

50
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,125
Lieutenant Barclay's
performance was adequate,

51
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,041
but clearly not rooted
in the method approach.

52
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,667
I do not understand...
Data, because it's polite.

53
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,417
Good job, Reg.

54
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,792
And only six weeks
for the lessons?

55
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,125
Good job period.

56
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,250
Well, we... we have
a patient teacher.

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,375
CRUSHER:
Uh, Worf?

58
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,834
I have an opening
in my workshop.

59
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,792
Well done.

60
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:49,125
Thank you, Counselor.

61
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,083
You've come
a long way, Reg.

62
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:54,417
After more...

63
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,959
more rehearsals
than I can count.

64
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:03,166
I don't just mean
your acting ability.

65
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,542
It takes a great deal
of courage

66
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:07,333
to put yourself
on display like that.

67
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,291
You... you think...
think so?

68
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,750
There was a time when nothing
could have dragged you

69
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,834
onto a stage
in front of an audience.

70
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,000
You've made
tremendous progress.

71
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:23,125
I, I... I guess.

72
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,875
Don't you think so?

73
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,917
Well, I just feel
more comfortable...

74
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,542
playing somebody else.

75
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:33,458
And maybe all of this is...
is... is not any better

76
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:37,458
than escaping into...
into a Holodeck fantasy.

77
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,250
I disagree.

78
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,917
This isn't fantasy.

79
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:43,709
It's theater.

80
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:46,000
You used to withdraw
onto the Holodeck.

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,250
You isolated yourself
inside your own imagination,

82
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,375
avoiding contact
with real people.

83
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,500
Look at yourself now.

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,000
Look at all the other
people you're with.

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,792
You're not just acting,
you're interacting.

86
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,166
Give yourself some credit,
Mr. Barclay.

87
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,458
Maybe you're right.

88
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:35,000
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44704.2:</i>

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,417
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>at the</i> Argus Array,

90
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,250
<i>a remote subspace telescope</i>

91
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,875
<i>at the very edge</i>
<i>of Federation space.</i>

92
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,041
<i>The unmanned structure</i>
<i>mysteriously</i>

93
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,166
<i>stopped relaying its data</i>
<i>nearly two months ago.</i>

94
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,750
The fusion reactors that power
the<i> Array</i> are unstable.

95
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,583
There is a risk
of overload.

96
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,250
What about
the computer systems?

97
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,417
They do not seem to be
functioning at all, sir.

98
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,709
Captain, I am picking up
an unidentified device

99
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:03,417
1.8 kilometers
from the<i> Array.</i>

100
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:05,083
On screen.

101
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,250
Magnify.

102
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,959
That's some kind of probe.

103
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,625
I bet that's what
damaged the<i> Array.</i>

104
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,583
Is it emitting
any signals, Lieutenant?

105
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,500
Negative, sir.
I show no activity.

106
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,291
Mr. La Forge,

107
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,291
why not go out
and take a closer look?
Aye, sir.

108
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,792
Lieutenant Barclay,
report to the Main Shuttle Bay.

109
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,709
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is
shuttle five in position.

110
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,834
Ready to begin
a short-range scan.

111
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,834
RIKER:
Proceed, shuttle five.

112
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:48,834
Reg, why don't we begin
with the passive hi-res series,
all right?

113
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,208
Electromagnetic band?

114
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,542
Give it a try.

115
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,959
I'm picking up
visual wavelengths only,

116
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,000
between 45, uh...

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,166
4,500 and 7,000 angstroms.

118
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,583
Let's try
the neutron densitometer.

119
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,625
Nothing.

120
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,709
Hmm... doesn't want to
give up any of its secrets.

121
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,625
Let's go to
an active scan.

122
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,333
No... no modulation.

123
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,792
Really?

124
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:27,542
You are definitely
not from our neighborhood.

125
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,959
Increase to 3.0.

126
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,709
Commander?
Yeah, Reg?

127
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:38,834
Thanks for assigning me
to this mission.

128
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,959
Don't mention it.

129
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,875
You're one of
my top engineers.

130
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:46,959
It's about time you got in on
some of the interesting stuff.

131
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,917
This...

132
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:51,333
this is why I'm in Starfleet.

133
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:57,083
There's still no, uh...
no modulation.

134
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,667
Well, hit it with
a positron emission.

135
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,458
Ooh.
What was that?

136
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,417
Computer's down, Reg.

137
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,959
Reg--

138
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,625
Reg?

139
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:50,500
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

140
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,250
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

141
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

142
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,625
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

143
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:05,458
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

144
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:09,375
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

145
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

146
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,834
<i>An intense energy surge</i>
<i>from the alien probe</i>

147
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:13,625
<i>has severely disabled</i>
<i>the shuttle's onboard computer.</i>

148
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,250
<i>The away team</i>
<i>has been transported</i>
<i>directly to Sick Bay,</i>

149
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,250
<i>where Lieutenant Barclay</i>
<i>remains under observation.</i>

150
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,208
Any indication of the probe's
energy source, Data?

151
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,333
No, sir.

152
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,417
Power emissions do not match
any known radiation patterns.

153
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:31,166
We have not encountered
this technology before, sir.

154
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,750
Very well, isolate the probe
and place it in tow.

155
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,375
We'll take it to Science Station
402 in the Kohlan system.

156
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,166
Captain, the probe
has begun to move.

157
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,792
It is approaching
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

158
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,959
Shields up.
Aye, sir.

159
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:53,375
There was enough energy
in that flash

160
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,709
to overload
your optic nerves.

161
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,041
It knocked you unconscious.

162
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,667
My visor must have
filtered it out.

163
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:58,959
Exactly.

164
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,625
But there was no apparent
retinal damage

165
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,208
and the cornea looks fine,

166
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,417
but I'm still waiting
for a full sero-amino readout.

167
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,834
I'll call you
when it comes in.

168
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:09,750
I'd like this done
as quickly as possible, Ensign.

169
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,291
You shouldn't have to wait
too long for the results.

170
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,291
What do you mean?

171
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,417
Couldn't you use a global mode
in your scanner?

172
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,083
It would be a lot faster.

173
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,333
That's not possible.

174
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:28,375
We're talking about human cells
here, not isolinear circuits.

175
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,500
I think you'd better stick
to engineering, Lieutenant.

176
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,834
A cell has
an electromagnetic signature

177
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,875
just as a circuit
element does.

178
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,542
Theoretically,
it should work

179
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:39,208
with just
a few adjustments.

180
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,542
(<i> Klaxons sounding</i> )

181
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:43,375
I could set it up for you
if you'd like.

182
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,709
Probe now closing
at 15.3 meters per second.

183
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:55,375
Collision course.

184
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,792
Captain, sensors are reading
no particulate emissions

185
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,041
or subspace distortions.

186
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,250
Then how is it
able to move?

187
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,500
Method of propulsion
is unknown, sir.

188
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,583
Ensign, take us
away from it.

189
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,333
One quarter impulse.
ENSIGN: Aye, sir.

190
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,959
The probe is matching
our speed and course.

191
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,333
Captain, an energy field
is forming around the devise.

192
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,375
Intensity is 3.2 terawatts
and increasing.

193
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,917
Sir, the shuttlecraft
shield did not provide

194
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,583
sufficient protection
for its computer.

195
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,375
Our computer may also
be vulnerable.

196
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:42,250
I recommend withdrawal
to a safe distance.

197
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,458
Ensign Anaya, full about.
Half impulse.

198
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,333
One-half impulse.

199
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:02,083
The probe is following.

200
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,583
Options, Number One?

201
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,458
We can't use
photon torpedoes.

202
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,291
An explosion this close
could cripple us.

203
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,041
Sir, recommend full phasers.

204
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,625
Proceed.

205
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,792
Firing phasers.

206
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,792
No effect, Captain.

207
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:26,417
The probe's field intensity
is continuing to build, sir.

208
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:27,917
We are in danger.

209
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:30,250
Riker to La Forge.
Can you increase phaser power?

210
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,417
Attempting to now, Commander.

211
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,208
Isolate phasers 80 to 120.

212
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,166
Shunt the plasma...
To the emitters.

213
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,041
Yes, sir,
I'm already on it.

214
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,750
Ready.

215
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,583
Phasers are as hot
as we can make them, Captain.

216
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,834
Mr. Worf?
Aye, sir.

217
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,250
Nothing.

218
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,709
Go to warp two.

219
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:57,291
Aye, sir.

220
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,834
Warp two.

221
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,166
The probe is
still with us, sir.

222
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,583
At warp two?
Yes, sir.

223
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,667
Captain, the probe's
energy output

224
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,166
is overloading our shields.

225
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,375
Failure anticipated
in 47 seconds.

226
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:22,959
I'm willing
to entertain suggestions.

227
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,125
Captain, we are dropping
to impulse.

228
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,166
Commander, warp power has been
transferred to the shield grid.

229
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,667
Yeah, but by whom?

230
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,792
Barclay?!

231
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,417
What are you doing?

232
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,458
Lieutenant Barclay
to Captain Picard.

233
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,792
You can fire photon torpedoes.

234
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,875
Maximum yield, full spread.

235
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,625
We're too close.

236
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,333
BARCLAY: I'm certain
the shields will hold.

237
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,083
Mr. La Forge?

238
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't know
how he did it,

239
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,959
but shield strength has
been increased by 300%.

240
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,000
It should be enough,
Captain.

241
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,709
Mr. Worf, photon torpedoes.
Maximum yield, full spread.

242
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,750
Aye.

243
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,375
Thank you, Mr. Barclay.

244
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,000
You're welcome, Captain.

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,083
Barclay out.

246
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,417
I'm sorry if I
overstepped my authority.

247
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,917
Don't mention it.

248
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,083
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44705.3:</i>

249
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,959
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has destroyed</i>
<i>the alien probe,</i>

250
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,000
<i>but now we are left</i>
<i>with the difficult task</i>

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,291
<i>of repairing</i>
<i>the</i> Argus<i> telescope.</i>

252
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,709
<i>Failure to do so</i>
<i>would represent</i>

253
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:20,041
<i>an incalculable</i>
<i>scientific loss.</i>

254
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,834
Mr. Barclay.

255
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:24,166
Everyone's still trying to
figure out exactly
how you did it.

256
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,083
It just occurred to me

257
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,375
that I could set up
a frequency harmonic

258
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,083
between the deflector
and the shield grid

259
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,166
using the warp field generator
as a power flow anti-attenuator.

260
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,291
And that, of course, naturally,
created an amplification

261
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,125
of the inherent
energy output.

262
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,208
Uh-huh. I see that.

263
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,041
I'm glad you could join us,
Mr. Barclay.

264
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,208
Your report,
Mr. La Forge.

265
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,792
Each of the telescope's
subspace antenna clusters

266
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:56,166
is powered by
its own fusion reactor,

267
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,333
but a single computer
controls them all.

268
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,625
So all 18 reactors were affected
when the computer was damaged?

269
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,458
LA FORGE:
Mm-hmm, that's right.

270
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,625
They're starting to overload and
could eventually go critical.

271
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,542
The explosion
would destroy the<i> Array.</i>

272
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,542
And I wouldn't want to be
next door when that happens.

273
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:12,208
Standard isolation procedure
would be advisable.

274
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,041
I agree. We'll cut off
each reactor from the damage
control system

275
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,750
and repair them one by one.

276
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,750
RIKER: How long will that take?
Two to three weeks at least.

277
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,792
All right, Mr. La Forge...

278
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,875
I don't agree.

279
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,458
We could repair all of
the reactors simultaneous

280
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,291
instead of one by one.

281
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,291
Simultaneously?
All 18?

282
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,583
Yes, sir.

283
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,458
But the<i> Argus</i> computer
is inoperable.

284
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,625
Not entirely.

285
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,208
The core memory
is still intact

286
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,750
and we could program
a completely new control system.

287
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,333
An interesting suggestion,
Lieutenant.

288
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,333
However, that approach
would require much more time

289
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,000
than our original plan,
at least seven weeks.

290
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,458
I could have it ready
for you in two days.

291
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,166
What?

292
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,667
If you could assist me
in the morning, Commander.

293
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,709
Sure, Reg.

294
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,458
The moon--

295
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,917
yes, that will be my home.

296
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:25,709
My paradise.

297
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,500
I shall find there
all the souls that I love--

298
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,083
Socrates, Galileo.

299
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,000
And when I arrive,

300
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,834
they will question
my worthiness.

301
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:39,458
What the devil
is he doing there among us?

302
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,959
Philosopher, scientist,

303
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,417
poet, musician, duelist.

304
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:48,291
Here lies Hercule-Savinien
de Cyrano de Bergerac.

305
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,875
I would not have you weep
any less for that

306
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:05,000
charming, good,
and handsome Christian.

307
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,709
I only ask this:

308
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:11,333
that as the great cold
surrounds my bones,

309
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:16,333
you allow a double meaning
for your mourning veil.

310
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:20,875
And when you let fall
your tears for him,

311
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,667
some few will be...

312
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,834
for me.

313
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,583
That was a real improvement.

314
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,834
Same time,
day after tomorrow?

315
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:45,083
Same time.

316
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:11,667
Reg?

317
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,208
May I join you?

318
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,458
Of course.
Please, sit down, Counselor.

319
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:20,083
Hard at work?

320
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,709
I'm getting prepared
for tomorrow's meeting
in Engineering.

321
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:25,542
We're planning
our repair strategy.

322
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:31,250
I really enjoyed the scene
you just performed.

323
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:35,000
You're a very
forgiving audience.

324
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,375
Not at all.

325
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,625
I thought you were
brilliant.

326
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,208
You've changed.

327
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,375
Is that
a professional opinion?

328
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,750
Pure observation.

329
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,458
You know, it's true.

330
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,208
I can't explain it.

331
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:59,458
In the past few days,
I've found confidence

332
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,417
I never knew was there.

333
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,458
I'm proud of you, Reg.

334
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,583
I'm glad for you, too.

335
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,250
Well, I'd better be going.

336
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,834
Must you?

337
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:19,709
I think so.

338
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,792
Wouldn't you like
to take a walk with me

339
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,458
through the arboretum?

340
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,291
The zalnias
should be in bloom.

341
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,667
Reg, as your
former counselor,

342
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,333
I don't think
it would be appropriate.

343
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,250
I don't need
a counselor.

344
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,417
What I need
is the company

345
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:42,375
of a charming,
intelligent woman.

346
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,166
Good night, Mr. Barclay.

347
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,208
Where's Lieutenant Barclay?

348
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,959
I stopped by his quarters
on my way over.

349
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,667
He wasn't there.

350
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:33,208
Computer, location
of Lieutenant Barclay.

351
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,500
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Barclay
is on Holodeck three.

352
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:45,333
G sub I,

353
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,750
J of T,

354
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,917
as T approaches
infinity...

355
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:02,125
G of T over G-naught.

356
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,667
So it is, so it is.

357
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,875
I still don't see how
you're going to incorporate

358
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,917
quantum principle
into general relativity

359
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:12,625
without adjusting
the cosmological constant

360
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,166
a lot more than
you're doing here.

361
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,583
Well, if we increase
the value as you suggest,

362
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,333
we must face
the possibility

363
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,417
of 26 dimensions
instead of ten.

364
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:23,500
I don't think
I could deal with that.

365
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,834
I certainly could not.

366
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:31,375
If the semiset curved
into the subatomic...

367
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,583
the infinities might
cancel each other out.

368
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:38,291
<i>Gruss gott...</i> 
they just might.

369
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,208
Ahem.

370
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,458
We had a meeting
at 0700.

371
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,750
I'm sorry, Commander.

372
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,917
Thank you, Professor.

373
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:48,583
End program.

374
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,333
What was that
all about?

375
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,208
I had some ideas
late last night

376
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,917
and I needed to consult
with the computer about

377
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:04,041
some quantum electrodynamic
calculations.

378
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,291
A Holodeck Einstein program
seemed like the best way--

379
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,959
I guess I went
a little overboard.
A little?

380
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,792
Most of the stuff
on that blackboard

381
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:12,709
was way out of my league
and yours, too.
Not really.

382
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:14,291
I just haven't thought
along those lines before.

383
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,792
It's all really
pretty evident now,

384
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,208
and if you would put
your mind to it, I'm sure--

385
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,417
Reg, ever since our run-in
with that probe,

386
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:22,000
something's different
about you.
What?

387
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,125
Because I'm beginning to behave
like the rest of the crew?

388
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,959
With confidence
in what I'm doing?

389
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,625
You just spent
the entire night arguing

390
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,625
grand unification theories
with Albert Einstein.
Yes, but...

391
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,625
Reg, something's
happened to you

392
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,125
and we can't
ignore that.

393
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,542
Yes, I've finally
become the person

394
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,333
I've always wanted to be.

395
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:45,583
Do we have to ask why?
Yeah, I think we do.

396
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,458
Incredible!

397
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,959
The production of
neurotransmitters
in your brain

398
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,917
has jumped by
over 500%.

399
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:03,375
Pre- and postsynaptic
membranes

400
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,375
have increased
permeability to match it.

401
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,917
I couldn't even guess
at your I.Q. level now.

402
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:12,125
Probably somewhere
between 1,200 and 1,450.
But that isn't all.

403
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,041
The<i> corpus</i> callosum,
the connecting bridge

404
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,500
between both sides
of the brain,

405
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,834
it is<i> so active now</i> 
that the hemispheres

406
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:19,500
are essentially
behaving as one.

407
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,417
So it's not just
raw intelligence

408
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:24,333
we're talking about here.
No.

409
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:27,834
Creativity, resourcefulness,
inspiration, imagination--

410
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,166
they've all been enhanced.

411
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:33,208
Lieutenant,
you could very well be

412
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:36,792
the most advanced human being
who has ever lived.

413
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,041
RIKER: Whatever that
alien probe did to him,

414
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,333
Barclay now seems to know more
about the internal workings

415
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:57,208
of the<i> Enterprise</i> 
than anyone else on board.

416
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,959
PICARD:
The question is how are we
going to deal with it?

417
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,709
We could confine him
to his quarters.

418
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,375
How can we do that?
What's he done?

419
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:07,375
We're talking about locking
a man up for being too smart?

420
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,083
If he's been influenced
by an alien,

421
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,417
wouldn't that
put us all at risk?

422
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,041
Not necessarily.

423
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,250
It might be something as
simple as an allergic reaction

424
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,875
to a bee sting.

425
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,000
PICARD:
Has Mr. Barclay done anything

426
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
that could be considered
potentially threatening?

427
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:28,166
Well, he did make a pass
at me last night.

428
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,792
A good one.

429
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:34,417
I'd hardly consider
that a threat.

430
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:37,834
No, but it's unusual
behavior for Barclay.

431
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:40,041
CRUSHER:
There's something else, Captain.

432
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:43,542
He taught violin technique
at the music school last night.

433
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,875
I didn't know Barclay
played the violin.

434
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,750
He didn't.
Not until last night.

435
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,000
Look, if we want to save
the<i> Array,</i> we need Barclay--

436
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,041
it's as simple as that.

437
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:57,041
Until he does
something more menacing,

438
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,834
I see no reason
why we should prevent him

439
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,834
from continuing his work.

440
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,709
LARSON:
Larson to Commander La Forge.

441
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:05,291
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

442
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:07,333
We're having trouble
containing reactor nine, sir.

443
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,125
It's starting to chain.
LA FORGE: I'm on my way.

444
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:13,500
You said he made a pass at you,
but you failed to mention

445
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,583
whether he was
successful or not.

446
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,917
Thermal level's up 177%.

447
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:29,875
Comparable increase
in neutron emissions.

448
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,166
Is the interface between
the computer and<i> Array</i> 
still in operation?

449
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:35,542
Yes, but our computer
is too slow

450
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:37,250
to direct the repairs.

451
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,166
The parameters are changing
too quickly for it to keep up.

452
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,333
Then we'll have to try
a remote shutdown from here.

453
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,709
Transmitting commands
to the<i> Array</i> now, sir.

454
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,250
Starting close down sequence.

455
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,709
Brower, increase the intake
of liquid helium three

456
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:49,792
into the reactor wall,
we've got to cool this off.

457
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,542
Transmitting commands.

458
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,083
Thermal level's
increasing, sir.

459
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,500
What happened?
BARCLAY: Unclear!

460
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,875
The interface
isn't fast enough.

461
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,417
LARSON: Commander La Forge,
overload indications

462
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:03,291
on<i> Argus</i> generator five,
seven and 14.

463
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,375
Damn!
Well, I can't do
anything from here.

464
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,417
I have to find
a better interface.

465
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,875
La Forge to Bridge.

466
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:13,625
We're looking at a cascade
reactor failure on the<i> Argus.</i>

467
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,750
I don't think we're going to
pull this one out.

468
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,583
Reactor nine
will reach critical

469
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,834
in ten minutes,
43 seconds.

470
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:22,291
The subsequent explosion
will create a chain reaction

471
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:25,083
along the entire length
of the<i> Array,</i> sir.

472
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:35,250
Ensign, stand by for
a jump to warp two.
ENSIGN: Yes, sir.

473
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,583
La Forge,
you've got ten minutes.

474
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,250
Mr. Worf, red alert.
Aye, commander.

475
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,208
(<i> red alert alarms blaring</i> )

476
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,500
Computer, begin new program.

477
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,917
Create as follows:
work station chair.

478
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:55,333
Now, create a standard
alpha-numeric console

479
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,291
positioned for the left hand.

480
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:58,750
Now an iconic display console

481
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,500
positioned for
the right hand.

482
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,208
Tie both consoles into the
<i>Enterprise</i> main computer core

483
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,834
utilizing
neural scan interface.

484
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:09,250
COMPUTER:
There is no such device on file.
No problem.

485
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,875
Here's how you build it.

486
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:14,083
<i>Argus</i> reactor nine--
28 seconds to critical.

487
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,208
Get us out of here.
Warp two, Ensign.

488
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,166
Yes, sir.

489
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,542
Helm's not responding, sir.

490
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,542
Captain, we have lost
computer control.

491
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,709
What?!

492
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,250
12 seconds to critical.

493
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,417
Go to manual.

494
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,500
I'm attempting that,
sir, but...

495
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,834
There's not enough time.

496
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,709
The computer is
coming back online, sir.

497
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,667
Captain...

498
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:52,834
the<i> Argus</i> reactors
are shutting down.

499
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:55,959
We are no longer
in danger, sir.

500
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:58,000
What happened?

501
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,667
Unknown, sir.

502
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,834
Geordi, what did you do?

503
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:05,625
It wasn't me, sir.

504
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:09,542
Computer, how were the<i> Argus</i> 
reactors shut down?

505
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:13,291
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
A neural interface was created
to expedite the repairs.

506
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:15,333
Barclay?

507
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:18,875
Computer, respond.

508
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,500
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
I am responding, sir.

509
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,542
I'm sorry if I caused
you any alarm.

510
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:25,625
It was necessary in order
to secure the<i> Array.</i>

511
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,125
Barclay?!

512
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,959
RIKER:
Barclay, what's going on?

513
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:34,792
Barclay?!

514
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:36,917
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
Yes, Commander.

515
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:38,959
It's me.

516
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,959
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
I'm sorry Captain,
I was only trying to help.

517
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,792
Our computer was too slow
to compensate

518
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:50,542
for the overload
on the<i> Array,</i>

519
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:53,917
so I created an interface
that communicated my thoughts

520
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,583
directly to the central
processing unit.

521
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:58,750
Exactly what does that mean?

522
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,667
My body is as you see it here,

523
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:03,375
but much of my higher brain
functions and memory

524
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,959
have been transferred to
the starboard computer core.

525
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:09,083
Mr. Barclay, remove yourself
from the computer system.

526
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,709
Leave the Holodeck.

527
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:15,208
I'm afraid I can't
do that, sir.

528
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,667
And why not?

529
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:19,625
My primary cerebral functions
are now operating

530
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:22,625
almost entirely
from within the computer.

531
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,667
They have expanded
to such a degree

532
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,375
that it would be
impossible to return

533
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,625
to the confines
of my human brain.

534
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,667
Any attempt to do so
would mean my death.

535
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:51,125
That's it.

536
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,917
I've disconnected
the audio and visual pickups.

537
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:56,709
We can talk without being
monitored by the computer.

538
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:58,834
By Barclay.

539
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:00,750
PICARD:
Report, Mr. La Forge.

540
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,333
It is now almost impossible

541
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,083
to tell where Barclay ends
and the computer begins.

542
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,250
He's actually rewriting
the isolinear chips

543
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,792
each time he extends
himself a little further.

544
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,458
How do we get him
out of there?
We don't.

545
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:14,166
Not without killing him.

546
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:17,500
This is an intolerable
situation.

547
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,417
I have no wish to harm him,

548
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:22,667
but I cannot allow Mr. Barclay
to continue to act
as the computer.

549
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,375
I don't care how smart he is.

550
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:27,250
Lieutenant Barclay has not
yet extended himself

551
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,959
into the Engineering
subsystems.

552
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:32,000
It may be possible to
establish an O.D.N. bypass

553
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,500
directly to the Bridge.

554
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,583
But that still won't give us
control of the ship.

555
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:38,333
No, but it would give us access
to the propulsion systems,

556
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,000
enough to get us
to the next starbase.

557
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,542
How long would it take
to set that up?

558
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:44,667
A few hours.

559
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,083
Make it so.

560
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,875
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
Commander La Forge?

561
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,917
Yeah, Reg?

562
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,792
COMPUTER/BARCLAY: I thought
you would be in your quarters.

563
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,291
No, I'm, uh...

564
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:08,208
just catching up
on some work, you know?

565
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:11,250
That level three diagnostic
we talked about.

566
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,333
How are you doing?

567
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,250
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
I wish I could convey to you

568
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,917
what it's like for me now--

569
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:21,959
what I've become.

570
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:23,834
Yeah?

571
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,917
Try.

572
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:28,417
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
I can conceive almost
infinite possibilities

573
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:32,041
and can fully explore
each of them in a nanosecond.

574
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:35,041
I perceive the universe
as a single equation

575
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:37,500
and it is so simple.

576
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,875
I understand.

577
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,750
You understand?

578
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,125
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
Everything.

579
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,041
Hmm.

580
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:54,125
Well, do you understand

581
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:57,125
how this happened to you?

582
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:59,625
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
I believe it is a gift--

583
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:03,250
that I have been chosen
to fulfill a great purpose.

584
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,333
Uh-huh.

585
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,959
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
Do you suppose all of this

586
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:10,792
has changed the way
people think about me?

587
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,625
To tell you the truth, Reg,

588
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,792
we don't know what to think.

589
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:18,875
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
I've been concerned about that,

590
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,917
but soon everyone
will understand

591
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:23,375
what I can do for humanity.

592
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,375
What do you mean?

593
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,667
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
We have always perceived

594
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,250
the maximum speed
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

595
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,709
as a function of warp.

596
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:35,500
But I know now
there are no limits.

597
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,166
We will explore new worlds

598
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:39,834
that we could never before
have reached in our lifetime.

599
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,333
I will take us to them.

600
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:55,458
Captain, I am picking up
subspace distortion.

601
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:58,250
Mr. Data?

602
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,041
This disturbance
is the result

603
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,291
of a highly charged
graviton field emanating

604
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,417
from our warp nacelles.

605
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:08,333
It is creating a severe bias
in the subspace continuum.

606
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,458
Mr. Barclay,

607
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,709
are you responsible for this
graviton field disturbance?

608
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:14,125
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
Yes, sir.

609
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,583
I'm altering subspace
in a way

610
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,458
that's never been
conceived of before.

611
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,959
I'm fairly certain
it will allow us to travel

612
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,709
halfway across
the galaxy in a matter...

613
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:24,875
Mr. Barclay, I want you to
stop this experiment for now.

614
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,750
COMPUTER/BARCLAY: Captain,
if you'd only allow me...

615
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,667
Mr. Barclay,
this is a direct order.

616
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,208
Discontinue whatever it is
you are doing.

617
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,417
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
I really would rather not, sir.

618
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:36,917
I'm positive that you'll
be pleased with the result
once I finished showing--

619
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:40,250
Audio is disconnected.
You may speak freely.

620
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,458
How long before the O.D.N.
process is in place?

621
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,417
I have been monitoring
Geordi's progress.

622
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,667
It will be operational
in 17 minutes.

623
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,500
Captain, let me go
to the Holodeck

624
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,083
and try
and talk to him.

625
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:54,709
Sir, the subspace distortion
continues to increase.

626
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,750
Hello, Deanna.

627
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,083
Reg.

628
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:25,083
I'm sorry that we can't take
that walk in the arboretum.

629
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,959
So am I.

630
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,542
Reg, you've frightened
all of us.

631
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:35,583
I'm sure that wasn't
your intent.

632
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:38,625
Young children are sometimes
frightened of the world.

633
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:40,417
That doesn't mean
that their parents

634
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:42,458
should let them stay
in their cribs.

635
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,834
Are we children to you now?

636
00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:47,083
I can see so much more

637
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,917
than you are capable of.

638
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,834
You should trust that.

639
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:54,041
Deanna, I've always wanted
to earn your respect.

640
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,291
You've got it.

641
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,709
From all of us.

642
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:04,959
We don't need
any more convincing.

643
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:08,750
Please, obey
the Captain's orders.

644
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,583
Stop whatever it is
you're doing.

645
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,166
You must trust me.

646
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:19,125
How can we trust an officer
who doesn't follow orders?

647
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:21,333
Trust me.

648
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,417
The Captain
will do everything

649
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:34,291
in his power to stop you.

650
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,917
(<i> red alert sounds</i> )

651
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:53,208
PICARD:
Picard to La Forge. Status?

652
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:56,291
Ready, Captain.
PICARD: Proceed.

653
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,542
Acknowledged.

654
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:00,875
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
Commander?

655
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,375
What?

656
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,750
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
You're too late.

657
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,709
Captain, we have not
regained control

658
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,291
of the propulsion systems.

659
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,834
The O.D.N. bypass to
the Bridge has been blocked.

660
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:22,417
Barclay!
COMPUTER/BARCLAY:
Yes, Commander Riker?

661
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:25,125
RIKER: Whatever it is
you're doing out there,

662
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,417
you've got to stop it.

663
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,667
WORF:
Sir, we're going in.

664
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,834
Mr. Barclay,
respond at once!

665
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,333
Audio is disconnected.

666
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,542
Lieutenant, take a security
team to Holodeck three.

667
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:04,125
Disconnect Mr. Barclay
from the computer.

668
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:07,333
Aye, Captain.

669
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,792
I want you to know,
Lieutenant Worf,

670
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:32,792
that I understand your duty
in this matter...

671
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:35,291
Phasers-- maximum setting.

672
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,917
...and that I will in no way

673
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:39,041
take your actions personally.

674
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,834
Conduits.

675
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,750
La Forge,

676
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,834
initiate stabilization
procedure.

677
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:04,291
LA FORGE:
Resetting stabilizers

678
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,375
Stand by.

679
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,959
He is protected
by a force field.

680
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,959
We could not
disconnect him.

681
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,375
Mr. Data!

682
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:18,166
We are experiencing
a quantum level

683
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:22,041
oscillation delay
doubling in intensity

684
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:25,083
every 12.3 seconds.

685
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:29,542
Bio-cellular disruption
is imminent.

686
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,417
Sir!

687
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:52,667
Where are we, Ensign?

688
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:55,542
Unless something is wrong
with our sensors, sir,

689
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:58,709
we're almost 30,000 light years
from where we were.

690
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:05,041
Center of the galaxy.

691
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:06,875
Sir, our heading's
been altered.

692
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,583
Approaching
planetary cluster.

693
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:12,125
Captain, all systems
are back under helm control.

694
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:15,166
The computer has returned
to normal functioning.

695
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,083
Hmm.

696
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,500
Captain!

697
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,834
Emotive.

698
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:26,417
Electro-chemical
stimulus-response.

699
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:29,291
Cranial plate.

700
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,208
Bipedal locomotion.

701
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,875
Endoskeletal.

702
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:37,083
Contiguous
external integument.

703
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,875
Hmm.

704
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,208
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard

705
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:48,542
of the Federation Starship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

706
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:52,667
Hierarchical collective
command structure.

707
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,959
Who are you?
Interrogative.

708
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:59,166
PICARD:
I am interrogative, yes,

709
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,917
and I would appreciate
an explanation.

710
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,083
I think I can help you
with that, Captain.

711
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,834
Mr. Barclay?

712
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:09,250
I thought it would be fatal
if you left the Holodeck.

713
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,166
The Cytherians
have reintegrated me, sir.

714
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:14,667
Cytherians.

715
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:17,750
The probe was designed
to instruct outsiders

716
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,333
on how to reach
the system.

717
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,125
The technologies are
not always compatible,

718
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:23,166
they failed
with the<i> Argus</i> computer

719
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,125
and with the computer
on board the shuttle,

720
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:29,250
but they were able
to reprogram me.

721
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,500
What do you want of us?

722
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,709
The same as you.

723
00:41:36,709 --> 00:41:38,542
Mr. Barclay?

724
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:41,041
You're both on
the same mission, Captain.

725
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,208
Mission?
Yes, sir.

726
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:46,166
The Cytherians are exploring
the galaxy just as we are.

727
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:50,208
The only difference is that
they never leave their home.

728
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:53,166
They bring others here.

729
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:57,917
Their only wish--
an exchange of knowledge.

730
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:00,208
They want to know us.

731
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:17,125
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44721.9:</i>

732
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:20,375
<i>After ten days in</i>
<i>the company of the Cytherians,</i>

733
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:24,166
<i>the</i> Enterprise<i> has been safely</i>
<i>returned to Federation space.</i>

734
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,166
<i>We bring back knowledge</i>
<i>of their race</i>

735
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:29,959
<i>that will take scholars</i>
<i>decades to examine.</i>

736
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:32,417
<i>Lieutenant Barclay</i>
<i>is apparently no worse</i>

737
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,291
<i>for his experience.</i>

738
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:37,291
So how much
do you remember?

739
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:39,625
I remember
doing everything.

740
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:42,625
I just don't remember
how or why.

741
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,667
How do you feel now?

742
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:46,959
Smaller.

743
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:48,917
Just plain old Barclay, huh?

744
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:53,041
It always seems to come back
to that, doesn't it?

745
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:57,291
You know, almost everyone
has a moment in their lives

746
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,417
when they exceed
their own limits,

747
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:02,875
achieve what seems
to be impossible.

748
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:06,625
The tricky part
is what happens afterwards.

749
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,375
You almost always
feel a sense of loss,

750
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:13,458
but it is possible to carry
something of that experience

751
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:15,208
through the rest of your life

752
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:19,792
in ways that you aren't
even aware of now.

753
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,417
I... I think I know
what you're saying.

754
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:26,000
Either way, Reg, you're
an important part of this crew.

755
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,166
In fact, I could
really use your help

756
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,250
with that level 3
diagnostic.
Sure.

757
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,917
Excuse me, Commander, but
I believe Mr. Barclay and I

758
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:37,500
had a date scheduled
for a walk in the arboretum.

759
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:43,875
The diagnostic can wait.
I'll see you later.

760
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:46,291
You really don't
have to do that.

761
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,083
I know.

762
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,917
May I?

763
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:00,166
Checkmate in nine moves.

764
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:05,625
I didn't know
you played chess.

765
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:07,667
I don't.
