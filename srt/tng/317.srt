00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:04,959
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43685.2:</i>

2
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:07,041
<i>As part of</i>
<i>an exchange program,</i>

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,125
<i>we are taking aboard</i>
<i>a Klingon officer</i>

4
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,667
<i>to return the recent visit</i>
<i>of Commander Riker</i>

5
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:13,375
<i>to the Cruiser</i> Pagh.

6
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,166
We must take care of him
while he's with us.

7
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,917
Commander Kurn is accorded all
the rights and responsibilities

8
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:20,291
due to a first officer
on board this ship.

9
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,125
If he should feel
patronized in any way...

10
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,625
Oh, I'm sure we'd know.

11
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,792
One does not patronize
a Klingon warrior.

12
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:30,041
Your experience on board
the<i> Pagh</i> will prove invaluable

13
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,625
during the Commander's tour.

14
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,250
Be sure the crew are prepared
for any unusual orders.

15
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,041
The Klingons
are very thorough.

16
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,500
I'm sure Commander Kurn
has studied for his assignment

17
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,125
just as I did
when I served with them.

18
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,083
I understand he requested
the<i> Enterprise</i> specifically.

19
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:47,083
Commander Kurn is ready
for transport, Captain.

20
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,542
Energize.

21
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,417
Welcome aboard
the<i> Enterprise,</i> Commander.

22
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:04,583
I'm Captain Picard.

23
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,125
This is Commander
William Riker.

24
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,417
He will be yielding
the first officer's position

25
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,625
to you during your tour.

26
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,041
You are relieved.

27
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,500
May I take my station, sir?

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,417
I thought I might show you
to your quarters first.

29
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:19,625
I am ready for duty, sir.

30
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,250
I ask that I be allowed
to take my station.

31
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,667
Very well.

32
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,375
If you will accompany us
to the Bridge.

33
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,542
I am Kurn,

34
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:39,625
commander rank,
Klingon Defense Force.

35
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:43,417
You will address me
as "Commander" or "sir"
at all times.

36
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:46,583
I am fully aware
of all Starfleet regulations

37
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,166
and they will be strictly
adhered to by all personnel

38
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,166
while I am in command.

39
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,458
It is my intention to bring
a sense of discipline

40
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,959
that you may not
be accustomed to.

41
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,083
With your permission,
of course, Captain.

42
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,250
Oh, by all means, Commander.

43
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,291
I have studied
all of your Starfleet records.

44
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,834
Impressive.

45
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,583
We shall see if you live up
to your reputations.

46
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,667
(<i> whispering</i> )

47
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:16,333
Do you wish to speak
Acting Ensign Wesley Crusher?

48
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,667
No, sir, Commander, sir.

49
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,375
The crew awaits your orders,
Captain.

50
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,083
Then take us to the outer
cometary cloud, Commander.

51
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,125
Set course 114,
mark 230.

52
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,291
One-third
impulse power.

53
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,250
Aye, sir.

54
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,875
Execute.

55
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,500
Engaged.

56
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,208
Increasing to one-third
impulse power, sir.

57
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:25,125
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

58
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:29,333
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

59
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,208
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

60
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,959
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

61
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,750
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

62
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,417
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

63
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,166
Mind if I join you?
No, sir.

64
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,625
Is there something wrong, Wes?
Commander Kurn, perhaps?

65
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,291
He just doesn't
seem to like me.

66
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,041
I can't do anything
right for him.

67
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,792
Every time I respond
to an order,

68
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,208
he jumps down my throat.

69
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,041
I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

70
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,250
Problem, Geordi?
Yes, sir.

71
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,333
It's our
new First Officer.

72
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,458
I take it he found something
wrong with Engineering.

73
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,125
Just the entire section.

74
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,375
He pulled
a surprise inspection

75
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,208
in the middle of
a maintenance cycle.

76
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,709
I tried to explain
it to him, but...
But he wouldn't listen.

77
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,333
We're all going to be doing
double shifts down there

78
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,375
just to get ready
for the next inspection.

79
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,208
(<i> sighs</i> )

80
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,250
His style of command
is just different.

81
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,250
Klingons believe in obedience

82
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,041
and a strict formality
of command.

83
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,250
Yeah, but this isn't
a Klingon vessel.

84
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,208
He's going to have
to loosen up, Commander.

85
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,041
WESLEY:
And it's not just us.

86
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,792
He's been leaning into everybody
pretty hard, except...

87
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:52,542
Except the one guy
who wouldn't really mind it.

88
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,083
(<i> console beeping</i> )

89
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,375
Sensors picking up asteroidal
debris ahead, Commander.

90
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,417
Can you identify
the coordinates, Mr. Worf?

91
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:03,542
Bearing 001,
mark .03

92
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:05,625
Range--
300,000 kilometers.

93
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,542
Excellent.

94
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,458
Please scan the asteroid field
for me, Lieutenant,

95
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,458
and report.

96
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,166
Approximately
2,000 small objects.

97
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,250
None directly in
our flight path, sir.

98
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,834
So no course correction
is necessary.

99
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:26,500
Is that what you are saying?

100
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,041
It should not be needed, sir.

101
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,291
Very good, Lieutenant.

102
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,375
You handled that well.

103
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,083
Yes?

104
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,875
Commander.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
Captain's mess?
Yes.

106
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,000
Resume.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,208
Your knowledge of
our systems and procedures

108
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,375
is very impressive.

109
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,166
Sir.

110
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,709
I would like to make
one suggestion, sir.

111
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,417
A suggestion?

112
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,583
When I served aboard the<i> Pagh,</i>

113
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:17,333
the hardest part for me
was recognizing and adapting

114
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,417
to the demands of the crew.

115
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,291
They needed an iron hand.

116
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,291
I imagine it must be
very difficult for you

117
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,041
to work with a crew
that is... so different.

118
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,625
I would be happy
to guide you in that regard

119
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,166
if it would be helpful.

120
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,875
No, Commander,
it wouldn't.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,542
This is not
a Klingon ship, sir.

122
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:46,166
No, Commander,
it is not.

123
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,667
If it were a Klingon ship,

124
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:51,875
I would have killed you
for offering your suggestion.

125
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,542
How long has
this bird been dead?

126
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:06,959
It appears to have been lying
in the sun for quite some time.

127
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,583
Well, it's not<i> dead.</i> 
It's been replicated and...

128
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,959
You do understand that
we cook most of our foods.

129
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,125
Ah, yes, I was told
to prepare for that.

130
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:21,041
I shall try some of your
burned, replicated bird meat.

131
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,166
I have attempted
to select a menu

132
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,542
that will allow you to sample
a variety of dishes, Commander.

133
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,834
Try some caviar.

134
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:35,750
(<i> growls</i> )
The odor is not palatable.

135
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,291
What is it?

136
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,959
The unhatched eggs
of a large, scaleless...

137
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,375
Later, Data.
A fish, Commander.

138
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,625
A delicacy from
the Caspian Sea on Earth.

139
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,458
It's a favorite of mine.

140
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,458
Our replicator has
never done it justice,

141
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:53,417
but I manage to store a few
cases for special occasions.

142
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:56,333
I am... honored, Captain.

143
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,417
Are you adjusting

144
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,208
to your new environment,
Commander?

145
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,750
I find the constraints
a bit difficult to conform to.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,041
Just a short while ago,

147
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,458
I had to stop myself
from killing Commander Riker.

148
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,125
(<i> laughs</i> )

149
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,875
I believed he was
trying to communicate

150
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,959
the crew's sense of discomfort
with my style of command.

151
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,083
Under normal circumstances,

152
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,875
I would consider that
a challenge to my authority.

153
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,417
One of the aims of
the exchange program, Commander,

154
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,709
is for us all
to learn tolerance.

155
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:42,834
As for my crew,
it may be healthy

156
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,166
to shake up the status quo
occasionally.

157
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,709
The Commander
certainly appears

158
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:50,542
to have the crew
on its toes, sir.

159
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:51,917
And then some.

160
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:54,250
No offense, sir.

161
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,875
None taken.

162
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,208
I never kill anyone at
the supper table, Mr. La Forge.

163
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,667
Don't you like it, Commander?

164
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,583
Our food has much
more<i> taste</i> to it.

165
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,542
While I'm sure
this is well-prepared,

166
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,583
it is much too bland

167
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,041
for the stomach
of a Klingon.

168
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,125
It seems to agree with Worf.

169
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,291
Yes.

170
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:33,959
(<i> door chimes</i> )

171
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,959
Enter.

172
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,959
<i>'el.</i>

173
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,375
Permission to
speak freely, sir.

174
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,125
For what purpose?

175
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,959
I have questions
I wish to pose.

176
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,834
Are your quarters
so<i> comfortable?</i>

177
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,834
They serve me.

178
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:03,750
This entire ship
seems built on

179
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,917
comfort, relaxation...

180
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,625
being at ease.

181
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,542
It is not the ship
of a warrior.

182
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:15,583
Not the ship of a Klingon.

183
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:21,625
You cannot ask these questions

184
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,917
within the boundaries
of protocol?

185
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,959
They are of a...

186
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,500
personal nature, sir.

187
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,709
Permission granted.
Pose your questions.

188
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:36,083
I wish to know
if I have given you offense.

189
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,709
I am not human.

190
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,583
If you had given offense,
you would not need to ask.

191
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,125
Perhaps I have not performed
my duties to<i> your</i> satisfaction.

192
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,834
I find you to be
a capable Starfleet officer,

193
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:50,291
a credit to your ship.

194
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:54,000
Yet, you dishonor me
at every opportunity.

195
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,083
Have I?

196
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,000
I did not know that being
polite to a Starfleet officer

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,959
would bring dishonor to him.

198
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,917
I am a Klingon.

199
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,041
Really?

200
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,291
Perhaps your blood
has thinned

201
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,625
in this environment.

202
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,375
I simply didn't
want to hurt you.

203
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,375
(<i> yells</i> )

204
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,041
<i>mev yap!</i>

205
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,917
So your blood is not
so thin after all.

206
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,959
I am a<i> Klingon!</i>

207
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,291
If you doubt it,
a demonstration can be arranged.

208
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,750
<i>That</i> is the response
of a Klingon.

209
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,542
The response I
would expect...

210
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,625
from my older brother.

211
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,917
I was barely a year old

212
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,417
when you left
for the Khitomer Outpost.

213
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:55,333
You, our mother and father
were not going to stay long.

214
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,333
It was decided that I
did not need to go.

215
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,625
I was left to stay with
our father's friend, Lorgh,

216
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,458
until your return.

217
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,291
You never did.

218
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,000
The Starfleet officer
that rescued me

219
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,291
was told by the Klingon
High Command that...

220
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,083
I had no living relatives.

221
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,625
They assumed that I was killed
with the family at Khitomer.

222
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,750
Lorgh had no sons.

223
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,458
He took me into his family.

224
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,709
It was not until I reached
the Age of Ascension

225
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:29,333
that I was told the truth.

226
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,792
So you asked

227
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,458
to serve aboard
the<i> Enterprise</i> to watch me.

228
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,667
It was an excellent
opportunity

229
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,667
to see what kind
of Klingon you were

230
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:40,667
or if you were
Klingon at all.

231
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:43,542
Your deception
offends me, brother.

232
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:44,792
It should.

233
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,417
But it was required.

234
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,375
To satisfy your curiosity.

235
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,208
No, much more.

236
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,500
You are the eldest son.

237
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,458
The challenge is
yours to make.

238
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,166
Challenge?

239
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,625
The Klingon High Council

240
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,125
has judged our father
a traitor to the Empire.

241
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,875
What are
the allegations, Worf?

242
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:15,291
My father is accused
of aiding and abetting

243
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,000
the Romulan attack
on the Khitomer Outpost.

244
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,792
The attack in which
he himself was killed?

245
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,375
But why now,
after 20 years?

246
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,041
I do not know,
Captain.

247
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,291
I will hear the evidence
when I arrive.

248
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,208
The charge has
been made by Duras,

249
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,458
the son of my father's
greatest rival.

250
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,834
Our family name
will be disgraced

251
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,333
for seven generations.

252
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,500
It is my responsibility
to clear his name

253
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,333
or answer for his crimes.
Answer for them?

254
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,417
The family of a Klingon warrior

255
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,166
is responsible for his actions

256
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,583
and he is responsible
for theirs.

257
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:57,542
If I fail in my challenge,
I will be executed.

258
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,333
Will you grant my leave,
Captain?

259
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,709
No.

260
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:05,542
If I understand correctly,

261
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:09,542
a Starfleet officer,
a respected member of my crew,

262
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,291
could be accused
of a capital crime.

263
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:16,375
Your actions in this matter
will reflect on this ship

264
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,041
and on the Federation.

265
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,709
Therefore, it seems
only appropriate

266
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:23,125
that your Captain
should be at your side

267
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,083
while you make
your challenge.

268
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,083
I'm sure you would do
no less for me.

269
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,333
Commander Kurn.
Sir.

270
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,542
We're changing course.

271
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,458
Set coordinates
for the First City

272
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,542
of the Klingon
Imperial Empire.

273
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:58,208
We arrive within the hour.

274
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,166
Yes.

275
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,375
The Council will receive you at
high sun in the Great Hall of...

276
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,792
I know the procedure
for the challenge.

277
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,458
You'll need a<i> cha'DIch</i> 
to defend you.

278
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:12,166
While you are accused,
you will not be allowed combat.

279
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,583
I would be honored
if you chose me.

280
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:22,333
I ask you to stand with me,
to be my<i> cha'DIch.</i>

281
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,333
<i>jIlajneS.</i>

282
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,083
<i>ghIj qet jaghmeyjaj.</i>

283
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,083
The two sons of Mogh--

284
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:33,125
together, we'll restore
the family honor.

285
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,959
No, for the proceedings,

286
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,166
you will not reveal
your true father.

287
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,333
I must.
You will not.

288
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,917
Because it would mean my death
as well if you fail.

289
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:46,250
A Klingon's honor means
more to him than his life.

290
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,333
Perhaps your human values
have clouded your judgment.

291
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,125
I insist.

292
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,875
On this ship,
you are my Commander

293
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,917
and I obey.

294
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:00,625
In council chambers,

295
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,083
you are my<i> cha'DIch.</i>

296
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,917
You do not insist.

297
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:07,083
<i>You</i> obey.

298
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,667
Yes, brother.

299
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,667
(<i> speaking Klingon</i> )

300
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,709
(<i> loud announcement</i>
<i>in Klingon</i> )

301
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:14,792
I am Worf, son of Mogh.

302
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:17,417
I have come to challenge

303
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:21,041
the lies that have been
spoken of my father.

304
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,083
(<i> excited murmuring</i> )

305
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,959
Worf, son of Mogh,

306
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,125
you have challenged

307
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,625
the judgment of the Council.

308
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:41,875
Are you prepared to answer
for this if you fail?

309
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,500
Yes, with my life.

310
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,667
Why do you come before us,
Commander?

311
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:52,208
I am Kurn,
son of... Lorgh.

312
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,542
I will stand
by Worf's side.

313
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,291
I am<i> cha'DIch.</i>

314
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,750
Hmm.
(<i> grunts</i> )

315
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,542
You claim a birthright
you have forsaken.

316
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,458
I have<i> not</i> forsaken
my heritage.

317
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,000
I am Klingon.

318
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,291
My heart is of this world.

319
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,041
My blood is as yours.

320
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:25,417
Yet, you come to us
wearing a child's uniform.

321
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:29,583
And you bring outsiders
to our Great Hall.

322
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,083
I am here at
my own request.

323
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:36,083
I am Captain Jean-Luc
Picard of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

324
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,125
Your words
mean nothing here.

325
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,333
Duras, let him speak.

326
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,083
Lieutenant Worf has
served under my command

327
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,000
with distinction.

328
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,333
He has earned my admiration
and my respect.

329
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,458
It is my greatest wish
that this Council,

330
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,500
in its wisdom,

331
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,083
will clear his family name
and return him to duty.

332
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:02,166
The trust of a commanding
officer is admirable.

333
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,583
Council has noted it.

334
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:08,125
Speak the accusation.

335
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,333
For many turns,

336
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,375
the truth about Khitomer

337
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,917
hath lain dormant,
unknown.

338
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:19,166
Now the truth
has been revealed.

339
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,792
The traitor, Mogh, sent
the defense access codes

340
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,834
to the Romulan
patrol ships,

341
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:28,250
allowing them to
destroy the outpost.

342
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,208
Thousands died
on Khitomer.

343
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,500
My<i> father</i> died on Khitomer.

344
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:41,166
Their deaths must be avenged.

345
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,250
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

346
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,583
Your father
was a traitor.

347
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,375
By posing this challenge,

348
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,959
<i>you</i> are a traitor.

349
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:20,125
You will not wear
the emblems of our people.

350
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,875
You are a fool

351
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:29,834
and your challenge can only
result in a fool's death.

352
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:33,125
It is a good day
to die, Duras.

353
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,625
And the day is not yet over.

354
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,458
Council stands in recess.

355
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,333
We will return
for the<i> Mek'ba.</i>

356
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,083
The evidence
will be presented.

357
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,333
<i>Qapla'!</i>

358
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:02,625
Mr. Data...

359
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,125
find out everything you can
about the destruction

360
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,291
of the Khitomer Outpost.

361
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,125
Cross-reference
with Romulan tactics

362
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,041
and strategic information
on the region.

363
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:13,417
And request access to the
Klingon central information net.

364
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:17,041
Computer, presentation overview
of Klingon custom and law

365
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,834
pertaining to
familial accountability.

366
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:20,166
COMPUTER:
Accessing.

367
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,709
In my ready room.

368
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,750
Worf.

369
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,041
I would speak with you.

370
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,250
Alone.

371
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,667
You should not have
brought the challenge.

372
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:55,166
There was no risk to you.

373
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,041
What does it matter?

374
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,750
I am Klingon.

375
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,208
Of that,
I have no question.

376
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:04,291
But your life
in the Federation

377
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:08,291
would not be affected
by this judgment.

378
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,291
My father...

379
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,333
Is dead.

380
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:15,417
He died long ago.

381
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:20,291
I knew your father,
served with him.

382
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:24,166
This is not how I wanted
to remember him.

383
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:28,041
We must let
the past be

384
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:31,625
and protect
what we have now.

385
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:35,166
If you leave
before the<i> Mek'ba,</i>

386
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:38,250
no shame will
come upon you.

387
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,333
Return to your ship.

388
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,792
Go back to your life.

389
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:45,625
The challenge
will be forgotten.

390
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:48,667
Why would you ask me
to lay aside

391
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,959
the honor of my father,

392
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:53,166
my family?

393
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,208
Are these the words
of the Council?

394
00:23:55,208 --> 00:24:00,250
I will not
be questioned by you.

395
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,208
Leave now,

396
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:06,333
or you, too, will be
condemned as a traitor.

397
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,291
What Federation starship was
the closest to the Khitomer

398
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,166
at the time of the attack?

399
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:21,625
DATA:
The USS<i> Intrepid</i> was the first
ship on the scene, sir.

400
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,875
Contact Starfleet.

401
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,291
Request all logs
of the<i> Intrepid.</i>

402
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:28,041
Riker to Dr. Crusher.
Crusher here.

403
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,709
I want you to look
over the medical records
from all the rescue vessels

404
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:32,792
that responded to
the Khitomer massacre.

405
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:35,291
See if there's any information
on the aftermath that
might help us.

406
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,917
CRUSHER:
Understood.

407
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,917
I should have known.

408
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:48,417
Worf was right.

409
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:51,709
It is a good day to die.

410
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:54,750
The time has not yet come.

411
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,625
It does not have
to come for many turns.

412
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:02,458
I know who you are, Kurn,
son of Mogh.

413
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,959
What?

414
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:07,625
It was a wise choice
to hide your family name.

415
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:10,458
Do not err now
by embracing it again,

416
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,625
for you only embrace death.

417
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,458
We shall see.

418
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:18,583
Worf has made a choice
and he will die for it,

419
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,375
but you can still be safe.

420
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,417
Let him stand alone.

421
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:26,792
He is my brother.

422
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,709
I will not betray him!

423
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:36,458
Then you will die for him.

424
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,875
(<i> growls</i> )

425
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,917
(<i> growling and grunting</i> )

426
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,750
(<i> grunts in pain</i> )

427
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:56,375
(<i> speaking Klingon</i> )

428
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:08,125
What kind of a weapon
makes a vicious wound like that?

429
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,041
It is a<i> kut'luch,</i>

430
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:13,959
the ceremonial weapon
of an assassin.

431
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:17,959
Fortunately, his metabolic
recovery is phenomenal.

432
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,208
He will be all right.

433
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,750
It does not matter.

434
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,834
We should have let him die.

435
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:27,208
Now that Duras
knows his bloodlines...

436
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,709
we will both be executed.

437
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:33,208
You sound like you've
already lost, Worf.

438
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:40,792
Commander, I have discovered
the basis of the charges

439
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:42,750
against Worf's father.

440
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,458
Apparently, the Klingons
recently captured

441
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:48,375
a Romulan ship with logs
that provided new information

442
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,000
on the Khitomer attack.

443
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,750
They clearly indicate
a transmission from the outpost

444
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,125
to the Romulan ship

445
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:56,250
moments before
the shields went down.

446
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,500
From Worf's father?

447
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,458
They do correspond to
Mogh's personal security code.

448
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,959
How can we be sure those records
haven't been falsified?

449
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:07,041
Well, we can cross-check
them against the<i> Intrepid's</i>
sensor logs.

450
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,959
I will try,

451
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,750
but the<i> Intrepid</i> was at
the edge of sensor range
during the attack

452
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,709
and we cannot be certain
if the scan was complete.

453
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:16,625
Looks like a pretty good
match-up, Data.

454
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,625
Both the<i> Intrepid</i> 
and the Romulan logs

455
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:21,041
show a series of distress
signals from Khitomer.

456
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,458
What happened
there?

457
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,542
Those are gaps
in the<i> Intrepid's</i> logs.

458
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,250
Missing information
due to the range.

459
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,208
That is where Mogh's alleged
transmission should be.

460
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:30,625
Right in the middle of the gap?

461
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:33,125
Wait a second, Data.
Back up.

462
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:36,208
Just before
the<i> Intrepid's</i> gap begins,

463
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,875
the timebase on both files
are in perfect sync.

464
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:41,083
But look.

465
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,750
Look at what happens
to the signal

466
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,417
after the shields
are dropped.

467
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:46,083
They are no longer
synchronous.

468
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,583
Commander, somebody's
been rewriting history.

469
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:53,542
I do not pretend to fully
understand the nuances

470
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,542
of your world's law
and culture, Lieutenant,

471
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:59,500
but I do understand when someone
is trying to hide something.

472
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,417
K'mpec urged me
to drop my challenge,

473
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:06,166
abandon my family honor.

474
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:10,250
It was impossible to believe
I was hearing a Klingon speak.

475
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,959
Obviously, they did not expect
and never wanted this challenge.

476
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,667
You're getting close
to something, Lieutenant.

477
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:19,625
Something they care
a great deal about protecting.

478
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,875
If it is true,

479
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:24,000
it is not just Duras

480
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,417
but the High Council itself
that is my enemy.

481
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,041
Captain...

482
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,709
I must choose
another<i> cha'DIch.</i>

483
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:38,291
I would like your permission
to ask one of the crew.

484
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:40,625
Well, of course, Lieutenant.
Choose whomever you wish.

485
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:44,041
Then I would ask you
to stand with me.

486
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:47,250
You may refuse
with no dishonor.

487
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,208
Thank you, Lieutenant.

488
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:52,208
I appreciate the gesture,
but I know that there are

489
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,542
stronger and younger men
from whom to choose.

490
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:58,959
I can think of no one
I would rather have at my side.

491
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,417
<i>jIlajneS.</i>

492
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:09,291
<i>ghIj qet jaghmeyjaj.</i>

493
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,709
I accept.

494
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:17,208
(<i> announcement in Klingon</i> )

495
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,959
My challenge will proceed.

496
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:37,417
No threats, no treachery
will stop it.

497
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:40,834
Not even a trap set
for my<i> cha'DIch</i>

498
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,792
by a coward.

499
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:45,083
Duras!

500
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:49,291
I will not hear lies
from the son of a traitor.

501
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:52,166
Keep your place,
Picard!

502
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,792
This is my place.

503
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,583
He is now my<i> cha'DIch.</i>

504
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,917
This is not your world, human.

505
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:00,583
You do not
command here.

506
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,333
I'm not here to command.

507
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:06,208
Then you must
be ready to fight.

508
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:11,000
Something Starfleet
does not teach you.

509
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,333
You may test that assumption
at your convenience.

510
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:33,417
I've got something.

511
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:36,542
Worf was not the only survivor
of the Khitomer massacre.

512
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:40,542
Another child?
No, a Klingon woman
was found<i> with</i> Worf.

513
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,000
RIKER:
Kahlest. Who was she?

514
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,959
I don't know, but the report
said she was severely injured,

515
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,500
was transferred to
Starbase 24 for treatment--

516
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,583
that was when she was
separated from Worf--

517
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:56,291
and after her recovery,
she returned home.

518
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:58,750
We've got to find her
if she's still alive.

519
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,917
Data, scan the Klingon
central net.

520
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:03,458
See if there's
any record of her.

521
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:07,959
DURAS:
The Romulans lowered the
outpost's shields themselves.

522
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,375
They were given
the defense access code.

523
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:13,000
The record
clearly shows

524
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,333
the Romulan patrol ship

525
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:19,083
receiving a personal
transmission from Mogh

526
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:22,458
seconds before
the shields fell.

527
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:25,000
RIKER:
Riker to Captain Picard.

528
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Stand by.

529
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:31,333
The Khitomer Commander
noted in his log

530
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:34,125
that Mogh had been
acting suspiciously...

531
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:37,750
Go ahead, Number One.
We've located another survivor
of the Khitomer massacre--

532
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,875
a woman who was
found with Worf.

533
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,417
Her name is Kahlest.

534
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,667
She resides in the Old Quarter
of the First City.

535
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:46,041
Well done. Picard out.

536
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,500
DURAS:
...Another witness testified
that Mogh often spoke

537
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,041
of his admiration
for the Romulans--

538
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:54,375
their culture,
their women.

539
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:57,333
Mogh betrayed us

540
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:01,458
and 4,000 Klingons
died on Khitomer.

541
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:05,041
Only the son
of Mogh survived.

542
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,417
K'mpec.

543
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:09,250
May we have
a short recess?

544
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:12,166
<i>Len'mat.</i>

545
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:20,166
Have you heard of
a woman called Kahlest?

546
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:23,083
She was my<i> ghojmok,</i> 
my nurse.

547
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,834
Then it's possible
she was an eyewitness

548
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:26,417
to your father's
activities on Khitomer.

549
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:29,000
But she died in the attack.
No, she survived.

550
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,625
She's living
in the Old Quarter.

551
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,166
I'm going to find her.

552
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,875
It is too dangerous.

553
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,625
You must not go alone.

554
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:38,542
Hey, I'm your<i> cha'DIch.</i>

555
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,834
Kahlest?

556
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,917
What do you want?

557
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,709
Your help.

558
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:26,583
No.

559
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:29,583
You don't even know
what I want.

560
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:33,917
You are<i> cha'DIch.</i>

561
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:35,625
I know.

562
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,875
Then you also know

563
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:40,083
that Worf's life
is at stake.

564
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,208
I cannot help.

565
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,417
I am dead.

566
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:47,041
A long time dead.

567
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,041
Were you with
Worf's father

568
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:51,041
just before the
attack on Khitomer?

569
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,208
No.

570
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:59,709
My life ended on Khitomer.

571
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:03,208
I served a proud family,

572
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,333
a strong house.

573
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,500
All that is gone.

574
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,667
Worf is not gone.

575
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:15,333
The family you served
needs you again.

576
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,792
I cannot help.

577
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,166
Was his father
a traitor?

578
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:25,083
No.

579
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,000
Mogh was loyal to the Emperor.

580
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:32,834
Mogh suspected someone
of plotting with the Romulans

581
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:35,125
and followed them
to Khitomer.

582
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:37,792
Who?
Who was the traitor?

583
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:40,667
I do not know.

584
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,917
Then we have no way
to prove Mogh's innocence...

585
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:51,959
and Worf will die
as the son of a traitor.

586
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:57,333
You must leave now,<i> cha'DIch.</i>

587
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,417
I am dead.

588
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:14,333
(<i> yelling in Klingon</i> )

589
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,291
(<i> groaning</i> )

590
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,875
My appreciation, madam.

591
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,667
You are brave,<i> cha'DIch.</i>

592
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,625
Worf chose well.

593
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:02,709
Kahlest, would they
recognize you?

594
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,667
Would they know who you are?

595
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:08,375
K'mpec would
remember Kahlest.

596
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,834
I caught his eye
back then,

597
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:14,542
but he was too fat.

598
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,625
Come back with me.

599
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:21,208
They won't know
how much you know.

600
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:24,250
It may shake loose the truth.

601
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,875
I will come.

602
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,083
DURAS:
The evidence is clear.

603
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:39,709
I would ask that
the judgment stand.

604
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:43,208
Let Worf be
condemned as a son

605
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,959
of a traitor
to the Empire.

606
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:47,291
(<i> Klingons growling</i> )

607
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:51,291
Worf, son of Mogh,

608
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,041
the judgment of...

609
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,709
K'mpec!

610
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:58,250
The<i> Mek'ba</i> is
not complete.

611
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,458
I bring an eyewitness
to the Khitomer massacre.

612
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:05,542
One who has
new evidence, K'mpec.

613
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:11,709
<i>Len'mat!</i>

614
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,166
What is it you think
you know, old woman?

615
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:15,583
Do not answer.

616
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:17,417
It is the rules
of the<i> Mek'ba</i>

617
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:20,333
that evidence be presented
in open council.

618
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,542
She will die before
she gives evidence.

619
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:24,917
Be silent, Duras.

620
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:28,583
Would you kill an old woman
to cover your dishonor?

621
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,542
Yes.

622
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:36,166
It is your dishonor
we are protecting here,

623
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,792
isn't it, Duras?

624
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:41,709
I have no reluctance
to kill<i> you,</i> human.

625
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:45,166
Are you prepared to hear
her evidence in open council?

626
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:48,750
Obviously, we would not.

627
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,041
Kahlest...

628
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:53,333
you can go now.

629
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:01,375
It is good
to see you again.

630
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:06,458
You are still fat, K'mpec.

631
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,500
I asked you to leave.

632
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,333
To let this challenge
go unanswered.

633
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,709
But you did not
hear my words,

634
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:24,834
and now it has
come to this.

635
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:30,792
Why did you judge
my father guilty

636
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,709
when you<i> knew</i> he was not?!

637
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:35,917
Someone had to be blamed.

638
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:38,792
The warriors who captured
the Romulan ship

639
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:41,041
had learned of the treachery.

640
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:43,667
But only the Council knew

641
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,667
whose security code
had been transmitted.

642
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:50,208
Ja'rod...

643
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:53,542
father... of Duras.

644
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:57,125
This<i> Ha'DIBah</i> should have
been fed to the dogs!

645
00:38:57,125 --> 00:39:01,000
His family is powerful.

646
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,291
If the truth were known,
it would shatter the Council.

647
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:08,750
Most certainly plunge
us into civil war.

648
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,417
You were in Starfleet.

649
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:14,000
We did not expect<i> you</i>
to challenge the judgment.

650
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,166
Nor did we know
there was another son of Mogh.

651
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:24,417
Worf's challenge
is successful.

652
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:27,542
The honor of his family
must be restored.

653
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:32,291
You do not understand.

654
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:35,709
His challenge was defeated

655
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,291
before he ever made it.

656
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:41,333
You will not be allowed
to present this evidence.

657
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,500
The judgment stands.

658
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,291
You will be condemned.

659
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,000
So will your brother.

660
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,625
There is no other way now.

661
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:52,667
You admit the truth

662
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:56,417
and yet expect him
to accept punishment?

663
00:39:56,417 --> 00:40:00,375
What does this say
of an Empire

664
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:02,959
who holds honor so dear?

665
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:07,125
The Empire will not
be destroyed

666
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:10,667
for one family's honor.

667
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:12,792
Unacceptable, K'mpec.

668
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:14,709
You have no say
in this,<i> cha'DIch.</i>

669
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:17,333
I speak now as the Captain
of the USS<i> Enterprise</i>

670
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,125
and Lieutenant Worf's
commanding officer.

671
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:23,041
You will not execute
a member of my crew,

672
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,250
nor will I turn his brother
over to you.

673
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,208
This is not
the Federation, Picard.

674
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,834
If you defy

675
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:32,709
an order of
the High Council,

676
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:35,792
the alliance
with the Federation

677
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:38,041
could fall to dust.

678
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:40,125
The alliance of the Federation

679
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:43,542
is not based on lies, K'mpec.

680
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:47,000
Protect your secrets
if you must,

681
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,583
but you will not
sacrifice these men.

682
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,542
I will die
for the Empire.

683
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:56,959
Lieutenant...

684
00:40:56,959 --> 00:41:00,000
The<i> cha'DIch</i> 
will be silent!

685
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:07,208
Allow my brother
to return to his life.

686
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:10,542
Only you need know
his true bloodline.

687
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:12,375
Not acceptable.

688
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,375
His honor would
demand revenge.

689
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:22,208
If you allow him to live,

690
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:24,250
I will give you something

691
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,667
that will serve your purpose
far more than my death.

692
00:41:30,709 --> 00:41:34,166
I will accept
discommendation.

693
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:36,083
Ah...

694
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,583
You...

695
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,875
would do this
in open council?

696
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:49,542
It would be the same

697
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:52,500
as admitting
your father's guilt, Worf.

698
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,709
So be it.

699
00:41:55,667 --> 00:42:00,542
Your heart is Klingon.

700
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:02,583
It will be done.

701
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:07,375
What has been said here

702
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:11,375
will never be
spoken of again.

703
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:18,583
<i>You</i> are the son of a traitor.

704
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,333
Now I am ready.

705
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:40,458
Why is he doing this?

706
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:43,000
I was prepared to die.

707
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,792
Worf wants you to live.

708
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:49,333
The name of your father
must someday be cleared.

709
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:53,083
He needs you alive
with your honor intact.

710
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,875
