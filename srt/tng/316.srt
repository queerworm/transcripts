<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43657.0.</i>

2
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:08,542
<i>While Commander Riker is away</i>
<i>on personal leave</i>

3
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:11,208
<i>the</i> Enterprise<i> has traveled</i>
<i>to Sector 396</i>

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,375
<i>to begin charting</i>
<i>the Salebi Asteroid Belt.</i>

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,166
He sent for you, too?

6
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,417
Yes.
He was very mysterious.

7
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,417
Do you have any idea
what this is about?

8
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,458
Something happened at that
cybernetics conference.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,834
Since he's come back,
he's spent

10
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,208
every off-duty minute
in that lab.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,500
It's not like Data
to be so secretive.

12
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,291
And cautious.

13
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,917
He's kept that lab
locked every minute.

14
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:35,875
Now, how would
you know that?

15
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:37,750
Uh-huh.

16
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,000
DATA:
Oh, you are early.

17
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,250
One moment, please.

18
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,458
DATA:
You may enter now.

19
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,417
Come on, Data.

20
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,458
What is this?

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,083
Yeah, Data,
what's going on?

22
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,583
I have invited you here
to meet someone.

23
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,583
DATA:
This is Lal.

24
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,250
Lal...

25
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,041
Say hello

26
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,208
to Counselor Deanna Troi.

27
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,417
Hello, Counselor Deanna Troi.

28
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,834
How do you do, Lal?

29
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:56,458
I am functioning
within normal parameters.

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,834
Lal...

31
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,583
this is Geordi La Forge.

32
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,542
Purpose for exterior drapings,
Father?

33
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,834
It is an accepted
custom

34
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,834
that we wear clothing.

35
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:11,000
Data, it called you "Father."

36
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:16,083
Yes, Wesley, Lal is my child.

37
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:52,458
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,709
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

39
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,375
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

40
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:01,792
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

41
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:06,709
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

42
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,166
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

43
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,250
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

44
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,917
<i>I have just been advised</i>
<i>of a highly unusual project</i>

45
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,542
<i>undertaken by Commander Data.</i>

46
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:22,583
Lal has a positronic brain,
one very similar to my own.

47
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,959
I began programming it
at the cybernetics conference.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,625
LA FORGE:
But nobody's ever been
able to do that, Data.

49
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,250
At least, not since
you were programmed.

50
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,542
DATA:
True, but there was

51
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,250
a new sub-micron
matrix-transfer technology

52
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,000
introduced
at the conference

53
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,417
which I discovered
could be used

54
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,542
to lay down complex
neural net pathways.

55
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,709
So, you did a transfer

56
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,834
from your brain
into Lal's?

57
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,208
Exactly, Wesley.

58
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,375
I realized
for the first time

59
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:48,792
that it was possible
to continue Dr. Soong's work.

60
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:49,959
My initial transfers

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,041
produced very
encouraging results.

62
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,291
So I brought Lal's
brain back with me.

63
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,417
PICARD:
Data...

64
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,959
I would like
to have been consulted.

65
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,000
I have not observed
anyone else on board

66
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,500
consulting you about their
procreation, Captain.

67
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:11,542
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

68
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,625
Why didn't you give it
a more human look, Data?

69
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,041
I have decided
to allow my child

70
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,750
to choose its own
sex and appearance.

71
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,542
Commander Data,
at your convenience

72
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,917
I would like to talk with you
in my ready room.

73
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,041
Counselor.

74
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,625
I insist we do
whatever we can

75
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:32,417
to discourage
the perception

76
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,250
of this new android
as a child.

77
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,834
It is<i> not</i> a child.

78
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,375
It is an invention, albeit
an extraordinary one.

79
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:41,083
Why should biology
rather than technology

80
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,166
determine whether
it's a child?

81
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,500
Data has created
an offspring--

82
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,792
a new life out
of his own being.

83
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,834
To me, that
suggests a child.

84
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,000
If he wishes
to call Lal his child

85
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,583
then who are we to argue?

86
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,917
Well, if he must, but
I fail to understand

87
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,291
how a five-foot android

88
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,875
with heuristic
learning systems

89
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:01,834
and the strength of ten men
can be called a child.

90
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,959
You've never been a parent.

91
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,583
What you have done

92
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,291
will have serious
ramifications.

93
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,583
I am truly dismayed
that you told no one

94
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,709
of what you were doing.

95
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,041
I am sorry, Captain.

96
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,792
I did not anticipate
your objections.

97
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,375
Do you wish me
to deactivate Lal?

98
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:29,959
It's a life, Data!

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,083
It can't be activated
and deactivated simply.

100
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:38,542
This is a most...
stupendous undertaking.

101
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,458
Have you any idea
what will happen

102
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,667
when Starfleet
learns about this?

103
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:47,709
I have followed all
of Starfleet's regulations

104
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,125
to the best of my ability.

105
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,291
I expected
they would be pleased.

106
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,583
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

107
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:59,709
Well... you have taken on
quite a responsibility, Data.

108
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,417
To prepare, I have scanned

109
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,542
all available literature
on parenting.

110
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:08,041
There seems to be
much confusion on this issue.

111
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,750
One traditional doctrine

112
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:13,208
insists "spare the rod
and spoil the child,"

113
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,250
suggesting a punitive approach,

114
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,125
while another,
more liberal attitude

115
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,625
would allow the child

116
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:19,583
enormous freedom.

117
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,291
Data...
And what Klingons

118
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,542
do to their children...

119
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,166
Data, I am not talking
about parenting!

120
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,250
I am talking about the
extraordinary consequences

121
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,250
of creating a new life!

122
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:32,709
Does that not describe
becoming a parent, sir?

123
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:44,500
Data, you are seeking
to achieve

124
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:48,000
what only your own creator
has been able to achieve--

125
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:53,542
to make another functioning
sentient android--

126
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,792
to make another Data.

127
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:59,750
That is why I must
attempt this, sir.

128
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:02,208
I have observed
that in most species

129
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,083
there is a primal instinct
to perpetuate themselves.

130
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:10,125
Until now, I have been
the last of my kind.

131
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,417
If I were to be damaged
or destroyed

132
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,875
I would be lost forever.

133
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:19,792
But if I am successful
with the creation of Lal

134
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,166
my continuance is assured.

135
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,667
I understand the risks, sir,

136
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:28,834
and I am prepared
to accept the responsibility.

137
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,625
(<i> woman chuckling</i> )

138
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,333
Gender female.

139
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,333
That's right,
just like me.

140
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,959
Gender male.

141
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,959
Correct.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,792
And I am gender... neuter.

143
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,959
Inadequate.

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,792
That is why you must
choose a gender, Lal,

145
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:55,083
to complete your appearance.

146
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,542
What are criteria?

147
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:00,000
Access your data bank
on sexuality, level two.

148
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,250
That will define
the parameters.

149
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,500
Whatever you decide
will be yours for
your lifetime.

150
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:09,709
It's a decision that
will affect how people
interrelate with you.

151
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,500
I choose your sex
and appearance.

152
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:13,500
No, Lal.

153
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:14,750
That would be confusing.

154
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,709
We are taking you
to the holodeck

155
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,291
to show you several
thousand composites
I have programmed.

156
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,125
You may choose from them.

157
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,083
Several thousand?

158
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,000
This is a big decision.

159
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,417
DATA:
Counselor?

160
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,041
Lal has narrowed
the choices to four.

161
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,834
Would you like to see?

162
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,834
Yes.

163
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,041
Yes, of course, Data.

164
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:50,542
Computer, Lal-- gender
sequence finalists, begin.

165
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,291
An Andorian female.

166
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,333
Interesting.

167
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,542
You'll be the only one
on board the<i> Enterprise,</i> Lal.

168
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:03,500
Hmm. That could make
socialization
more difficult.

169
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:05,208
A human male.

170
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,458
Very attractive.

171
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,125
There's no problem
with socialization here.

172
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,959
A human female.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,917
I like her.

174
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,875
A Klingon male.

175
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,625
A friend for Worf.

176
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,875
They're all very interesting.

177
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,834
Do you have a favorite?

178
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,625
Yes, I have chosen.

179
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:33,542
I have completed assembly
of the replicated anatomy.

180
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,000
I was able to provide Lal

181
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,083
with more realistic skin
and eye color than my own.

182
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,250
Congratulations, Data.

183
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,250
It's a girl.

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,667
This is home, Lal.

185
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,625
Home.

186
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,709
Place of residence.

187
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,333
Social unit formed by
a family living together.

188
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,750
Yes.

189
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,834
We are a family, Lal.

190
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,959
Chair.

191
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,291
To sit in.

192
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,250
Sit.

193
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,917
Good.

194
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,083
Painting.

195
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,000
Painting.

196
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,250
Colors produced
on a surface by
applying a pigment.

197
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,875
Yes.

198
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:41,000
I will teach you to recognize
the artistry in paintings.

199
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,917
Soft.

200
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,709
Yes, very good, Lal.

201
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,667
You have correctly processed
the sense of touch.

202
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,875
There are many
fascinating experiences

203
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,917
I wish to share with you.

204
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,291
Painting.

205
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,583
No.

206
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,959
That is a flower, Lal.

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,750
Inhale.

208
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,542
(<i> sniffs</i> )

209
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,375
(<i> sniffs</i> )

210
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:10,375
Smell!

211
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:11,375
Yes.

212
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,125
Show me more, Father.

213
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,709
DATA:
<i>Second Officer,</i>
<i>Science Log, supplemental.</i>

214
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,166
<i>Training in social skills</i>

215
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,291
<i>at the most elementary level</i>
<i>has begun.</i>

216
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,000
<i>Lal is progressing very slowly</i>

217
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,959
<i>but is not deterred</i>
<i>by early setbacks.</i>

218
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,709
<i>While motor coordination</i>
<i>has improved 12 percent,</i>

219
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,583
<i>reflexes still need</i>
<i>to develop.</i>

220
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,000
<i>Visual comprehension is</i>
<i>especially difficult for Lal.</i>

221
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:47,375
<i>Translating her vast data banks</i>
<i>into recognizable applications</i>

222
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,709
<i>may improve</i>
<i>with additional transfers.</i>

223
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,208
<i>She is also learning</i>

224
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,417
<i>to supplement</i>
<i>her innate android behavior</i>

225
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,750
<i>with simulated human responses.</i>

226
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,125
<i>And it is interesting to note</i>

227
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,625
<i>that as I observe Lal</i>
<i>learning about her world,</i>

228
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:09,333
<i>I share in her experience,</i>
<i>almost as though</i>

229
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,917
<i>I am learning things</i>
<i>over again.</i>

230
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,208
The transfer itself
is fairly simple.

231
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,250
Each neural pathway
in my brain

232
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,458
is duplicated
precisely in hers.

233
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,208
Theoretically,
the duplicate brains

234
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,125
should be able to store and
process the same information,

235
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,458
but until all of the transfers
are complete

236
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,750
we will not know for certain.

237
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:44,792
What does Lal do
when you're on duty?

238
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:46,583
She studies in our quarters.

239
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,875
She requires
very little supervision.

240
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,834
Lal is quite self-sufficient.

241
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,500
Have you considered
sending her to school?

242
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:54,333
She already has access

243
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,000
to the sum of human knowledge--
from me.

244
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,917
Data, she could learn
a lot by being with
children her own age.

245
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,875
She is only two weeks old.

246
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:05,083
Okay, close to her own age.

247
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,500
CRUSHER: Dr. Crusher
to Ensign Crusher.

248
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,291
Aren't you supposed to be
getting a haircut, Wesley?

249
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,959
I'm on my way.

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,583
Parents...

251
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,750
Nothing personal.

252
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:31,166
Lal, the third cross-link
transfer series is complete.

253
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,333
Father, what is my purpose?

254
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,125
Purpose?

255
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,125
My function.

256
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,959
My reason for being.

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,792
That is a complex
question, Lal.

258
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,417
I can only begin
to answer

259
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,875
by telling you
that our function

260
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:52,959
is to contribute
in a positive way

261
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,542
to the world in which we live.

262
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,583
Why am I me, instead
of someone else?

263
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,500
Because you are my child.

264
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,291
Where did I come from?

265
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,750
These questions...

266
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,458
These questions suggest

267
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,333
that we have made
a successful transfer

268
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,333
of the heuristic
associative pathways.

269
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,709
You will now begin
to process information

270
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,417
on logic, aesthetics,
metaphysics and epistemology.

271
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,458
You are truly
becoming sentient, Lal.

272
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,959
How?

273
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,375
By developing the awareness

274
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:29,500
to question and examine
your perceptions.

275
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,750
Why do we have two hands?

276
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,834
Why not three or four?

277
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,625
Why is the sky black?

278
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:38,542
Why do...?

279
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,750
(<i> click</i> )

280
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,750
Tomorrow will be your
first day of school, Lal.

281
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,375
I assure you, Admiral,
there is no better guide

282
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,041
into this life for Lal
than Data.

283
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,000
He's doing an excellent job.

284
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,542
We all have enormous admiration

285
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,333
for what Commander Data
has already achieved

286
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:08,875
but we have superior facilities
and personnel here at Galor IV.

287
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:11,667
A starship is hardly
the proper setting for...

288
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,500
This starship's mission is
to seek out new life

289
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,333
and that is exactly
what Commander Data is doing,

290
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,792
under my guidance.

291
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,875
We all want what's best
for the new android.

292
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,875
As do I.

293
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

294
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,333
I would be willing to consider
releasing Lal<i> and</i> Data to you

295
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,166
so that he may continue
his work with her.

296
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,333
His presence
would undoubtedly retard

297
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,542
the new android's progress.

298
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:40,125
Admiral, to you,
Lal is a new android.

299
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,000
But, to Data...
she's his child.

300
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,625
His child?

301
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,542
Yes, Admiral--
it may not be easy

302
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,417
for you and I
to see her that way

303
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:55,500
but he<i> does,</i> 
and I respect that.

304
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:57,375
They will remain here for now.

305
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,375
Starfleet's policy on research
is clear.

306
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:03,959
You're making your stand
on very uncertain ground.

307
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,041
I do hope it doesn't fall
out from under you.

308
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,917
Haftel out.

309
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,625
She achieved
a very high score

310
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,667
on a test
of academic achievement.

311
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:20,375
A perfect score.

312
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:24,208
Yes, which is why we started her
out with the older children,

313
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,583
but Lal couldn't
understand the nuances

314
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,583
of how they related
to each other.

315
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,583
I see.

316
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,417
We decided
the best thing to do

317
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,750
would be to put her
with younger children.

318
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:38,000
That would seem
to be reasonable.

319
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,125
It isn't working out that way.

320
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,083
The children
are afraid of her.

321
00:17:56,834 --> 00:18:01,250
Father, what is the significance
of laughter?

322
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:05,500
It is a human
physiological
response to humor.

323
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,417
Then, judging
from their laughter,

324
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,792
the children at school
found my remarks humorous.

325
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:17,333
So without understanding humor,
I have somehow mastered it.

326
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,625
Deck 15.

327
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,041
Lal.

328
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,375
Yes, Father?

329
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,750
The children were not
laughing<i> with</i> you.

330
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,667
They were laughing<i> at</i> you.

331
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:33,750
Explain.

332
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:36,834
One is meant kindly,
the other is not.

333
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,291
Why would they wish
to be unkind?

334
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,333
Because you are different.

335
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,000
Differences
sometimes scare people.

336
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,542
I have learned
that some of them

337
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,959
use humor to hide their fear.

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,583
I do not wish to be different.

339
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,959
Doctor?

340
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,375
I require your advice
as a successful parent.

341
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:11,834
Uh! W-Well, thank you, Data.

342
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,917
I'd like to think I was.

343
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:17,375
Well, please sit down.

344
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,000
How's Lal?

345
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,291
Lal is realizing

346
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,417
she is not the same
as other children.

347
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,041
Is it lonely for her?

348
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,041
She does
not feel

349
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,959
the emotion of loneliness,

350
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,709
but she can observe how isolated
she is from the others.

351
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,667
She wishes to be more like them.

352
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,125
I do not know
how to help her.

353
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,417
Lal is passing into sentience.

354
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,250
It is perhaps the most difficult
stage of her development.

355
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:56,166
When... when Wesley
was growing up

356
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,500
he was an extraordinarily
bright boy,

357
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:02,792
but he had a hard time
making friends.

358
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,458
I think the other children

359
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
were a little
intimidated by him.

360
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:10,000
That is precisely what
happened to Lal in school.

361
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,667
How did you help him?

362
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:17,333
Well... first, I went back
to my own childhood

363
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,750
and remembered
how painful it was for me

364
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,458
because... I remember a time

365
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,375
when I wasn't very popular,
either.

366
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:28,875
And when I told that to Wesley

367
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:31,166
it made him feel
a little better.

368
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,333
He knew I understood
what he was going through.

369
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,792
I have not told Lal

370
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,333
how difficult it was for<i> me</i>
to assimilate.

371
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,875
I did not wish
to discourage her.

372
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:42,667
Perhaps that was an error
in judgment.

373
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,250
You didn't have anyone

374
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,458
with experience
to help you through sentience.

375
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,125
She, at least, has you.

376
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:55,000
Just help her realize
she's not alone

377
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,917
and... be there to nurture her

378
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:01,125
when she needs love
and attention.

379
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:05,291
I can give her attention,
Doctor,

380
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,166
but I am incapable
of giving her love.

381
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:16,041
Now, why do I find that
so hard to believe?

382
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,417
(<i> rapid beeping</i> )

383
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,625
WORF:
Captain, incoming signal.

384
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,333
Starfleet priority one.

385
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,500
Admiral Haftel.

386
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,750
On my monitor, Lieutenant.

387
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,750
Admiral.

388
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,792
HAFTEL:
Captain Picard, I hope
I didn't disturb you.

389
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,375
Not at all.

390
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:41,750
I have discussed my concerns
with Starfleet Command.

391
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:45,208
You are to hold your position
until I join you.

392
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,208
And I shall personally review
the android's development.

393
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,250
Understood.

394
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,667
I should advise you, Captain,

395
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:54,375
that if I'm not satisfied
with what I see,

396
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:57,583
I am empowered to take
the android back with me.

397
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,041
Haftel out.

398
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,959
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

399
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,792
<i>We are holding position</i>
<i>pending the arrival</i>

400
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:11,834
<i>of Admiral Haftel</i>
<i>from Starfleet Research.</i>

401
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:15,291
<i>Commander Data is completing</i>
<i>his final neural transfers</i>

402
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,250
<i>to the android</i>
<i>he has named "Lal,"</i>

403
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,792
<i>which, I have learned,</i>
<i>in the language Hindi</i>

404
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>means "beloved."</i>

405
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,041
That looks very good.

406
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,208
Thanks, Guinan.

407
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,417
Hello, Data.

408
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,875
Guinan.

409
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,959
Lal, how are you?

410
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,291
I am functioning
within normal...

411
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,417
I am fine, thank you.

412
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,834
Good.

413
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,834
Guinan, Lal needs
to observe human behavior.

414
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,375
Well, she's in
the right place for it.

415
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:54,458
And, for this opportunity

416
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,959
she is willing
to provide services

417
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
to assist you.

418
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,000
Ah.

419
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,083
Father says
I would learn

420
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,250
a great deal
from working

421
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,792
with someone
as old as you.

422
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,375
You're hired.

423
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,542
The most important part about
working someplace like this

424
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,417
is the art of listening.

425
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,375
I have some expertise,
so I shall teach you.

426
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:17,250
That would be
most beneficial.

427
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,458
I've been programmed
with a listing of 1,412

428
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
known beverages.

429
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:22,917
What did you say?

430
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:25,083
I've been programmed
with a listing of 1,400--

431
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,333
"I've"?

432
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,375
You have used
a verbal contraction.

433
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:30,959
You said "I've"
instead of "I have."

434
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,417
It is a skill my program
has never mastered.

435
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,750
Then I will desist.

436
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:35,875
No.

437
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:38,083
You have exceeded my abilities.

438
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,458
I do not object, but...

439
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,542
I do not understand
how this has occurred.

440
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,083
PICARD: Picard
to Commander Data.

441
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,709
Please report to my ready room.

442
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,333
Aye, sir.

443
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:01,250
I am certain the Admiral
is anxious to meet Lal.

444
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,500
I have been sending him

445
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,000
regular status reports
on her development.

446
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:09,625
His visit is not just an
inspection of Lal's progress.

447
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,750
He has expressed
a concern

448
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:13,375
for her environment.

449
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:14,750
Her environment, sir?

450
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:18,917
He believes the Daystrom Annex
on Galor IV

451
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,000
would be more suitable.

452
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:24,500
Then he wishes to relocate us.

453
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:27,709
Not you, Data.

454
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,417
Just her.

455
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,458
I would not be
in favor of that, sir.

456
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,667
There are many things that she
can learn only from me--

457
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:40,041
my lifetime of experiences,
the mistakes I have made

458
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,166
and what I have learned
from them...

459
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:45,500
WORF:
Captain, Commander Riker's
shuttle has just returned.

460
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:47,125
Acknowledged,
Lieutenant.

461
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,959
Will you advise
Commander Riker

462
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,417
I will meet with
him in one hour.

463
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,667
Picard out.

464
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:54,375
The Admiral is
taking the position

465
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:57,291
that Lal's development
should be overseen

466
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,333
by the most
experienced
personnel.

467
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:08,500
Then he is questioning
my ability as a parent.

468
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:11,417
In a manner of speaking.

469
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:14,208
Does the Admiral have children?

470
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,083
Yes, I believe he does, Data.

471
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,375
Why?

472
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,291
I am forced to wonder

473
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,750
how much experience
<i>he</i> had as a parent

474
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:27,417
when his first child was born.

475
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,709
You see?

476
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,250
What are they doing?

477
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,959
It's called flirting.

478
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,834
They seem to be communicating
telepathically.

479
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,250
They're both thinking
the same thing

480
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:49,792
if that's what you mean.

481
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:57,125
Guinan, is the joining of hands
a symbolic act for humans?

482
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:59,542
It shows affection.

483
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:01,250
Humans like to
touch each other.

484
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:04,166
They start with the
hands and go from there.

485
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,250
He's biting that female!

486
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,583
No, he's not biting her.

487
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:10,834
They're pressing lips.

488
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,917
It's called kissing.

489
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:19,542
Why are they leaving?

490
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,083
Lal, there are some things

491
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,875
your father's just going
to have to explain to you

492
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:25,125
when he thinks
you're ready.

493
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,333
You're new around
here, aren't you?

494
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,792
Yes.

495
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,291
Lal? Lal!

496
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,583
Put him down.

497
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,875
DATA:
Commander?

498
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:48,750
What are your intentions
toward my daughter?

499
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:51,333
Your daughter?

500
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,667
Nice to meet you.

501
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:09,291
I watch them and I can do
the things they do,

502
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:13,583
but I will never
feel the emotions.

503
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,625
I'll never know love.

504
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,125
It is a limitation
we must learn to accept, Lal.

505
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:22,375
Then why do you still try
to emulate humans?

506
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,166
What purpose does it serve

507
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:27,041
except to remind you
that you are incomplete?

508
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:31,458
I have asked myself
that many times

509
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,166
as I have struggled
to be more human.

510
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:40,250
Until I realized it
is the struggle itself

511
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,208
that is most important.

512
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,750
We must strive to be
more than we are, Lal.

513
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,208
It does not matter

514
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,417
that we will never reach
our ultimate goal.

515
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:53,875
The effort yields
its own rewards.

516
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:57,125
You are wise, Father.

517
00:27:57,166 --> 00:28:02,375
It is the difference between
knowledge and experience.

518
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:08,333
I learned today that humans
like to hold hands.

519
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:12,166
It is a symbolic gesture
of affection.

520
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:40,625
No<i> objective</i> viewpoint
could see it any other way.

521
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:43,500
Forgive me, Admiral, I
thought you were sent here

522
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:46,208
to form an opinion,
not to justify one.

523
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,709
Captain, let's not make this
any more difficult

524
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,333
than it needs to be, hmm?

525
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,208
I see no need
for it to be difficult at all.

526
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,667
I understand your concerns.

527
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:58,333
What I'm asking for
is time, patience.

528
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,667
If you have
an open mind

529
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:01,250
I'm sure you
will see

530
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:04,083
that it is imperative that Data
and Lal be kept together

531
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,250
during the formative stages
of her development.

532
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:09,667
After that, I have no doubt
Commander Data will be delighted

533
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:11,875
to deliver her
to Starfleet Research.

534
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,875
That's not satisfactory.

535
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:16,125
If mistakes are made,

536
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:19,041
the damage that's done
might be irreparable.

537
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:22,375
I'm convinced the damage
<i>will</i> be irreparable

538
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:24,041
if they're separated.

539
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:29,291
Captain, are we talking
about breaking up a family?

540
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:33,834
Isn't that rather a sentimental
attitude about androids?

541
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,709
They're living, sentient beings.

542
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,417
Their rights and privileges in
our society have been defined.

543
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:43,333
I helped define them.

544
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:46,208
Yes, Captain, and I am
more than willing

545
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,667
to acknowledge that.

546
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:49,625
What you must acknowledge

547
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:52,875
is that Lal may be
a technological step forward

548
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:56,458
in the development
of artificial intelligence.

549
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,458
A most significant step.

550
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,834
Yes, and work like this

551
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,291
demands to be done
with controlled procedures.

552
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,208
Which Commander Data
is following.

553
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,583
In effective isolation,

554
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:10,792
and that is what Starfleet
Research finds unacceptable.

555
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:17,333
So Lal now possesses
the sum of my programming.

556
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,667
Her neural nets
are laid down

557
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:21,333
identically to yours?

558
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,166
There do seem to be some
variations on the quantum level.

559
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:25,959
She can use contractions.

560
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,083
I cannot.

561
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,750
An aberration.

562
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,959
What have you done about this?

563
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,250
I have maintained records
on positronic matrix activity,

564
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,834
behavioral norms,
and all verbal patterns.

565
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,458
I have seen no other evidence
of aberrations.

566
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,667
It would seem you have actually
improved upon yourself, Data.

567
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:45,500
Is that not the goal
of every parent, sir?

568
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:46,875
But, as a good father,

569
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:49,208
don't you think
it would be better

570
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,250
especially in the light
of this new aberration

571
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:53,625
if Lal were close

572
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,500
to people trained
in diagnostic

573
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:57,250
and evaluative
procedures?

574
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:00,291
I am programmed with the
procedures you mentioned, sir,

575
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,375
and in any meaningful
evaluation of Lal

576
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:07,125
you would require a model
for a basis of comparison.

577
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,750
I am the only model available,
Admiral.

578
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,959
You haven't mastered
human cultural

579
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,375
and behavioral norms
yourself yet, have you?

580
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:16,333
No, sir.

581
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,500
Where is Lal now?

582
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:33,291
This is your idea of
appropriate guidance?

583
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:36,125
It is an opportunity for her
to observe human behavior,

584
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:40,667
and more importantly, for her
to interact with her crewmates.

585
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,041
Thank you.

586
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,625
She is capable of running

587
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:48,542
over 60 trillion calculations
a second,

588
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:51,166
and you have her working
as a cocktail waitress.

589
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:54,834
Admiral, she is under
the strict guidance of a woman

590
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:57,041
in whom I have absolute trust.

591
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,458
Ten-Forward is the center
of the ship's social activity.

592
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,125
Everyone on board comes here.

593
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,750
I'm not convinced the sort
of behavior she observes here

594
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,583
will be a positive influence.

595
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,000
Well, most people
when they come in here

596
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:09,750
behave themselves,
and when they don't

597
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:11,750
I ask them to leave.

598
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:14,083
Admiral Haftel, Guinan.

599
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,667
She runs Ten-Forward.

600
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:17,125
How is Lal doing?

601
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,458
Oh, she spills a few
drinks every now and then,

602
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,458
but she's learning.

603
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,750
(<i> woman laughing</i> )

604
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,125
No, I think I've had
enough, thank you.

605
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,208
Excuse me.

606
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,417
I want that android out of here.

607
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,959
Now, Admiral, you've
been in one or two bars

608
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,542
in your time.

609
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:35,917
Have her report to me
immediately for an interview.

610
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:57,875
Well, Lal, I've been
looking forward to meeting you.

611
00:32:57,917 --> 00:32:59,458
Why?

612
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,750
You're very important to us
at Starfleet Research.

613
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:05,583
We have quite a facility
at Galor IV.

614
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,166
I want to show it to you.

615
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,917
In fact, the Admiral
is suggesting

616
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,333
you be moved to Galor IV, Lal.

617
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,542
Have I done
something wrong?

618
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,000
Oh, no, of course not.

619
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,291
We just want to broaden
your experience.

620
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,542
There's only so much
you can learn on a starship.

621
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,583
I'm sure you'll agree to that.

622
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,875
Yes, I'll agree.

623
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,083
Good.

624
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,000
Thus, the natural conclusion
would be

625
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:30,583
when I have learned all there is
to learn aboard the starship

626
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,291
I would relocate to Galor IV.

627
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,417
That is not
the natural conclusion here.

628
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:38,542
I believe it is.

629
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,625
You see, Lal, the
Admiral is concerned

630
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:45,125
that you need
more... guidance

631
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,250
than your father
can provide here

632
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,542
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

633
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:49,625
Yes, don't misunderstand me.

634
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,417
I have great respect
for your father.

635
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,458
You do not speak
with respect.

636
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,750
She seems very
adversarial.

637
00:33:57,792 --> 00:34:00,291
I'm merely stating a fact,
Admiral.

638
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:04,834
I don't think your father has
taught you selective judgment

639
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:08,208
in the verbalization
of your own thoughts.

640
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,875
Now, that is a skill
we will help you develop.

641
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,792
My father is
already helping me, sir.

642
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:18,250
The question is,
has he helped you enough?

643
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,625
Are you asking me, sir?

644
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,750
No, I didn't mean to ask...

645
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,583
Why don't we, Admiral?

646
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,125
In all these discussions,

647
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,959
no one has ever mentioned
her wishes.

648
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
She's a free, sentient being.

649
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:35,875
PICARD:
What are your
wishes, Lal?

650
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:41,000
I wish to remain here,
Captain Picard.

651
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,583
Thank you, Lal.

652
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,166
You're excused.

653
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:01,458
(<i> door chimes</i> )

654
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,709
Come in.

655
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:11,041
Hello, Lal.

656
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,208
How are you?

657
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,291
Troi...

658
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:17,667
Admiral... Admiral...

659
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:23,291
An admiral from Starfleet
has come to take me away, Troi.

660
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,417
I am scared.

661
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,041
You<i> are</i> scared,
aren't you?

662
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:35,208
I<i> feel</i> it.

663
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,875
How is this possible?

664
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:39,959
I don't know.

665
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:48,709
This is what it
means to feel.

666
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:57,083
This is what it means...
"feel."

667
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:12,125
You have Lal off to a wonderful
start in life, Commander.

668
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:16,375
And that's what being a parent
is all about.

669
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:18,583
However, I have finally decided

670
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:21,709
that I must ask you
to release her to me.

671
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,875
May I ask why, sir?

672
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:25,458
All other arguments aside,

673
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,834
there's one
that is irrefutable.

674
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:31,625
There are only two Soong-type
androids in existence.

675
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,083
It would be very dangerous

676
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,917
to have you both
in the same place,

677
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,709
especially aboard a starship.

678
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,250
One lucky shot by a Romulan,
we'd lose you both.

679
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:44,250
Admiral, that is
a fine argument,<i> but...</i>

680
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,083
it doesn't change my feeling

681
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:51,166
that the proper place
for Lal to develop

682
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,417
is by Data's side.

683
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,458
You're not a parent, Captain.

684
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
I am.

685
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:04,750
I have learned, with difficulty,
that there comes a time when...

686
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:07,000
There comes a time
when all parents

687
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,375
must give up
their children

688
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:09,542
for their own good.

689
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,291
But this is not the time.

690
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:16,208
Damn it, even I can see the...

691
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,792
the umbilical cord
is virtually uncut.

692
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:21,083
The child...

693
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:26,959
The child depends on him.

694
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,125
Mr. Data, it would
be better for Lal

695
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,792
if she left knowing that
you had voluntarily decided

696
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:39,750
that this was the best
course of action.

697
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:43,166
Admiral, when I
created Lal,

698
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,000
it was in the hope that someday

699
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:47,166
she would choose
to enter the academy

700
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:49,417
and become a member
of Starfleet.

701
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:51,291
I wanted to give something back

702
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:54,417
in return for all
that Starfleet has given me.

703
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:57,375
I still do.

704
00:37:57,417 --> 00:38:00,250
But Lal is my child.

705
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:03,834
You ask that I volunteer
to give her up.

706
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,542
I cannot.

707
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,500
It would violate
every lesson

708
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:09,959
I have learned
about human parenting.

709
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,542
I have brought a new life
into this world.

710
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:17,250
And it is<i> my</i> duty,
not Starfleet's

711
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:21,208
to guide her through these
difficult steps to maturity,

712
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,500
to support her as she learns,

713
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:28,417
to prepare her to be a
contributing member of society.

714
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:32,417
No one can relieve me
from that obligation,

715
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,458
and I cannot ignore it.

716
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,041
I am...

717
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,542
her father.

718
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,750
Then I regret
that I must order you

719
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,542
to transport Lal aboard my ship.

720
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,333
Belay that order,
Mr. Data.

721
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,583
I beg your pardon.

722
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:00,417
I will take this
to Starfleet myself.

723
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:04,000
<i>I</i> am Starfleet, Captain.

724
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,542
Proceed, Commander.

725
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:06,834
Hold your ground, Mr. Data.

726
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:08,834
Captain, you are
jeopardizing

727
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:10,709
your command and your career.

728
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:19,959
There are times, sir,
when men of good conscience

729
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,667
cannot blindly follow orders.

730
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:25,500
You acknowledge their sentience

731
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:31,917
but you ignore their personal
liberties and freedom.

732
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:34,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

733
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:38,834
Order a man to hand his child
over to the state?

734
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,375
Not while I am his Captain.

735
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,166
If you wish,

736
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,417
you can accompany us
to Starfleet, where we shall...

737
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:46,959
TROI:
Troi to Commander Data.

738
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,458
Report to your lab at once.

739
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:51,834
Acknowledged, Counselor.

740
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:54,250
He's on his way.
Is there a problem?

741
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:59,125
Yes, Captain, something
is terribly wrong with Lal.

742
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,375
TROI:
It lasted
barely a moment.

743
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:05,208
She experienced
fear and confusion

744
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,917
and then, for no
apparent reason

745
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,625
she walked out
of my quarters.

746
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:11,208
She didn't say
another word.

747
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,291
She just started
walking here and
each step became

748
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,417
more and more
difficult.

749
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:16,834
Lal is programmed

750
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,709
to return to the lab
in the event of a malfunction.

751
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,709
Father?

752
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,000
Yes, Lal, I am here.

753
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:27,000
A malfunction...

754
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,917
emotional awareness.

755
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,667
It appears to be a symptom
of cascade failure.

756
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:34,417
It would require initialization
of the base matrix

757
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,750
without wiping out
higher functions.

758
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:39,083
I agree.

759
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:42,750
May I assist?

760
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,500
Thank you, Admiral.

761
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,875
If you'll excuse us,

762
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:49,834
Commander Data and I
have much to do.

763
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,375
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

764
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:58,667
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

765
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,709
(<i> click</i> )

766
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,166
(<i> beeping</i> )

767
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,792
(<i> door opens</i> )

768
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,583
She...

769
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:31,583
she won't survive much longer.

770
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:35,417
There was nothing
anyone could have done.

771
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:42,125
We'd repolarize one pathway,
and another would collapse.

772
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,709
And then another.

773
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:51,041
His hands... were moving faster
than I could see,

774
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:54,667
trying to stay ahead
of each breakdown.

775
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:56,500
He refused to give up.

776
00:41:56,542 --> 00:42:00,333
He was remarkable.

777
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:07,709
It just... wasn't meant to be.

778
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:20,542
Lal, I am unable to correct
the system failure.

779
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:22,667
I know.

780
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:25,709
We must say good-bye now.

781
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,125
I feel...

782
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,583
What do you feel, Lal?

783
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:38,709
I love you, Father.

784
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:49,333
I wish I could
feel it with you.

785
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:53,834
I will feel it
for both of us.

786
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:59,709
Thank you for my life.

787
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,375
Flirting.

788
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,542
Laughter.

789
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:12,959
Painting, family.

790
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,750
Female.

791
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:17,500
Human...

792
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:30,000
Lal suffered complete neural
system failure at 1300 hours.

793
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,291
I have deactivated the unit.

794
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,917
The crew is saddened
by your loss, Mr. Data.

795
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:47,458
I thank you for your sympathy,
but... she is here.

796
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,083
Her presence so enriched my life

797
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:53,000
that I could not allow her
to pass into oblivion.

798
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:57,834
So I incorporated her programs
back into my own.

799
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:02,125
I have transferred
her memories to me.

800
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:07,083
Mr. Data, will you
take your position.

801
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:12,166
Mr. Crusher,

802
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:16,333
lay in a course
for the Starbase on Otar II.

803
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:22,417
WESLEY:
Course is set, sir.

804
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,583
PICARD:
Engage.
