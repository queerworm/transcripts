00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:06,709
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41294.5:</i>

2
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:10,291
<i>Our destination:</i>
<i>the class M Beta Cassius planet</i>

3
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:12,667
<i>known simply as Haven.</i>

4
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:16,041
<i>It is a world so renowned</i>
<i>for its peaceful beauty</i>

5
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:19,417
<i>that some believe it to have</i>
<i>mystical healing powers.</i>

6
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:22,041
<i>We will rest and relax...</i>

7
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,583
<i>all too briefly, I fear.</i>

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,625
Such a beautiful world.

9
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,959
Legends say it has been
known to mend souls

10
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,959
and heal broken hearts.

11
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:38,250
Legends which are totally
unsupported by fact, Captain.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,750
Legends like that are the spice
of the universe, Mr. Data,

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,625
because they have a way
of sometimes coming true.

14
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:54,542
(<i> harp music</i> )

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,625
Lieutenant Yar
to Commander Riker.

16
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,959
Your presence is requested
in Transporter Room One.

17
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:14,083
Sorry, ladies.

18
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,208
Duty calls.

19
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,750
You needed me, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,375
There's an object of some
kind beaming in from Haven.

21
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,375
What is it?
We're not sure.

22
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,875
The surface station approval
coming in now, Lieutenant.

23
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,291
All right.
Let's bring it in.

24
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,750
Odd-looking.

25
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,417
What's going on?

26
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:56,291
(<i> gasp</i> )

27
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:00,041
I hold a message
for Deanna Troi.

28
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,291
Lwaxana Troi

29
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,875
and the honorable Miller family
will soon arrive.

30
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:10,750
The momentous day
is close at hand.

31
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,959
Rejoice!

32
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,709
(<i> laughing</i> )

33
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,417
No.

34
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:20,709
No.

35
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:22,625
What's going on?

36
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,291
(<i> clattering</i> )

37
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:27,542
Jewels... Look at these jewels.

38
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,625
They're bonding gifts...

39
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:35,417
what you would call
wedding presents.

40
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,375
Who's getting married?

41
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,208
I am.

42
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:08,250
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

43
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,250
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

44
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

45
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,625
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

46
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:22,375
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

47
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:26,667
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

48
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:42,458
I was certain it would
never happen, Captain--

49
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,959
the years I'd spent
on this mission...

50
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,625
the distance it has
taken me from home.

51
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,166
As you must have heard,

52
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,667
genetic bonding
is a Betazoid tradition.

53
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:57,959
Steven Miller was my
father's closest friend.

54
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,834
Your father was human, Deanna.

55
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:01,750
The Millers are human.

56
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,583
Will you and your husband

57
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,375
be staying with the ship,
Counselor?

58
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,750
No, sir.

59
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,875
Then...

60
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,250
I'll just say...

61
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,166
congratulations
for now, Deanna.

62
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,834
If you'll excuse me.

63
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,875
Will...

64
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,792
more than anything
in the world--

65
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,917
anything--

66
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:48,041
you want to be
a starship captain.

67
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,250
True?

68
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,750
That's not all I want, Deanna.

69
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,625
I can feel that.

70
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:57,542
I know you care,
within those limits.

71
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,875
Did you hear what I said?

72
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,625
Every word.

73
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,250
This whole thing
is still bizarre.

74
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,875
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,375
Come dance at my wedding.

76
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,458
I'll try.

77
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:31,542
Message from planet
Haven, Counselor.

78
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:34,917
They wish to beam the Miller
wedding party aboard.

79
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,542
I'm Jean-Luc Picard,
Captain of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

80
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,959
Welcome aboard.

81
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,208
Quite some starship
you have here, Captain.

82
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,667
I look forward to this visit.

83
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,291
You couldn't be!

84
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,250
I'm Deanna.

85
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,792
Oh, Deanna, darling!

86
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:13,750
You probably don't
even remember me.

87
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,041
Oh, Wyatt was
absolutely right.

88
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,083
She is a beauty.

89
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,709
I'm Wyatt.

90
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,583
Isn't this
simply beautiful?

91
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,583
I knew romance was
still alive somewhere.

92
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,583
I'd like you to have this.
It's a chameleon rose.

93
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,625
It changes color with the mood
of its owner.

94
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,458
It's wonderful.

95
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,000
Thank you.

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,834
When is
my mother arriving?

97
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,208
Your mother is still
down on the planet, Deanna.

98
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,000
Why?

99
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,208
Uh, is there is place
for my parents to rest, Captain?

100
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:03,291
Well, uh, we're not really
tired, son.

101
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,000
Besides...

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,041
I'd like to see
some of the ship.

103
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,291
Steven, you know full well

104
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,667
Lwaxana Troi isn't about
to beam on board

105
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,291
until we leave.

106
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,083
So...

107
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,125
You can see your quarters
now, if you like.

108
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,375
Will you show the Millers
to their accommodations, please?

109
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,417
And I shall join you later.

110
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,875
Two more are ready
to beam in, sir.

111
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,917
So be it.

112
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,417
Wyatt seems
a fine young man.

113
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,250
Yes, he does.

114
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,709
But I'm not
what he expected.

115
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,625
I don't understand.

116
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,542
Neither do I,

117
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:53,625
but I'm definitely a surprise
of some sort to him.

118
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,500
I should warn you, sir...

119
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,000
my mother is a little...

120
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,041
eccentric.

121
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,166
Where is everyone?

122
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,917
Oh, I hate that.

123
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,583
Hello, Mother.

124
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,125
<i>No, don't say it, think it.</i>
<i>Use your mind, not your mouth.</i>

125
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,667
Hello, Mother.

126
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,417
<i>Deanna, shame!</i>

127
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,667
<i>What has this life done to you?</i>

128
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,917
No, no, no.
Don't tell me.

129
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:33,625
You're the Captain.
Of course.

130
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,875
Your daughter has explained
your telepathic abilities.

131
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,208
No, that wasn't telepathy--
it was just common sense.

132
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,291
Who else would greet me
but the Captain?

133
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,917
You may carry my luggage.

134
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,000
Mother!

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,208
No, no,
that's quite all right.

136
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,750
I'm indebted to your mother
for the fine Counselor she's...

137
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,959
This way.

138
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:06,250
Mother, it's quite inappropriate
to ask the Captain...

139
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,667
Yes, you do seem to
be having difficulty.

140
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:11,291
A man your age must work
to keep himself in shape.

141
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,291
Mother, I'm not going
another step like this.

142
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,417
A starship has its customs
just as we do.

143
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:21,667
If you're my mother's valet
then please valet!

144
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:24,750
Oh, please, don't let me
keep you from doing your duty.

145
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,875
I apologize
for her behavior.

146
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,125
Do you realize you've
embarrassed your Captain?

147
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,250
Oh, no.

148
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,834
Anything to avoid
a quarrel

149
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,208
on this occasion.

150
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,834
It's amazing
how that accent of yours

151
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,834
reminds me of your father.

152
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,834
Your last valet tried
so hard to rid me of it.

153
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:42,959
Whatever happened
to Mr. Xelo?

154
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,375
Oh, I was forced to
terminate his employment.

155
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,333
Xelo was strongly
attracted to me.

156
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,125
His thoughts became truly
pornographic.

157
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,792
Of course, the thoughts
of Wyatt's father toward me...
Passenger accomo...

158
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:57,583
...were almost as vulgar,
but he really doesn't have...

159
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,417
Passenger accommodations.

160
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:02,291
He doesn't really
have Xelo's imagination.
Mother...

161
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,291
Between him and that
woman's inane chatter

162
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,959
it's a wonder
I made it here at all.

163
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,709
How do you like
the Millers, Captain?

164
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,125
Oh, I'm sure I find them
perfectly pleasant.

165
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,750
As for me,
I find it shocking

166
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,208
how they have changed
in the years

167
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,041
since my husband
and I knew them.

168
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,291
Of course, it's probably
because I've grown beyond them.

169
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,709
You realize, of course,
that with Betazoids

170
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,083
our ability to read
the thoughts of others

171
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,375
does see us grow much faster
than the typical plodding human.

172
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,834
<i>Mother, that's enough!</i>

173
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:32,333
<i>So, you're not totally</i>
<i>out of practice.</i>

174
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,917
<i>Good, very good.</i>

175
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,000
We hope you find
the room comfortable.

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,333
Ah, yes.
The room is adequate.

177
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,083
Small, but adequate.

178
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,792
You will, of course,
adjust the temperature

179
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,166
to a civilized level?

180
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,709
Ah, I'll see what I can do.

181
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,792
And now,
if you will excuse me.

182
00:11:56,792 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm sure the two of you
have a lot to talk about.

183
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,083
Oh, yes, Captain.
You may go.

184
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:11,250
<i>You've been slack, little one.</i>

185
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,208
<i>Allowed your mental powers</i>
<i>to rust.</i>

186
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,792
<i>Only to avoid</i>
<i>confusion, Mother.</i>

187
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:20,542
<i>Humans constantly think</i>
<i>one thing and say another.</i>

188
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:23,333
<i>Yes, they do, don't they?</i>
<i>Poor dears.</i>

189
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,208
<i>Our style of complete honesty</i>
<i>frightens them.</i>

190
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,375
On that subject, Mother,

191
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:33,417
there is such a thing as
too much honesty with humans.

192
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,875
<i>If they'd only say</i>
<i>what they think</i>

193
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,542
<i>instead of hiding it.</i>

194
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:40,333
<i>An entire shipload</i>
<i>of such inconsistency</i>

195
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:44,333
<i>could drive one insane.</i>

196
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:48,208
Darling, I'm terribly sorry
about what happened here.

197
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,417
Truly I am.

198
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:52,125
Steven Miller
tracked me down

199
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,667
and reminded me
of the vows we had made.

200
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,166
Mother, I'm having
some trouble

201
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,000
believing in those
vows as once I did.

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,750
Deanna...

203
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,542
But I'll honor them,
of course.

204
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:08,041
I'm a Betazoid.

205
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,333
You may find Wyatt
an unusual person.

206
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,417
I've sensed remarkable
depths in him.

207
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,250
Message coming in
from Haven, Captain.

208
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,041
On screen.

209
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,083
I'm Valeda Innis,
first Electorine of Haven.

210
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,583
Captain Picard?

211
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,709
Greetings, Electorine.
I'm Picard.

212
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,667
Your presence honors us

213
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,875
and your timing
is fortuitous, Captain.

214
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,291
In what way?

215
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,208
An incoming vessel
has bypassed our Stargate

216
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,834
violating our law.

217
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,709
It has refused
any attempt at communication.

218
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,250
Are you saying
you believe it to be hostile?

219
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,166
Failure to communicate
is inherently hostile.

220
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,834
We have no defensive
capabilities here

221
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,250
and our treaty
with the Federation

222
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,834
specifies your obligations
in that matter.

223
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,500
Agreed.

224
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,667
But let's hope it doesn't
become a defense matter.

225
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,250
Of course, Captain.

226
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,792
But I am very happy
we have you here.

227
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,375
(<i> door chime</i> )

228
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,333
Come in.

229
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:28,291
I wanted to apologize
for my mother's behavior.

230
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,291
Your mother's honest.
I respect that.

231
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,417
Yes, but she
never lets up.

232
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:39,875
I'll admit her honesty
is a bit persistent.

233
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,291
I never heard
it described better,

234
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,291
but it is a Betazoid trait.

235
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,875
I'll try to be
only half as annoying.

236
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,667
Let's see...

237
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,667
what can I tell you
about myself?

238
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:58,250
I'm a medical doctor,
for whatever that's worth.

239
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,917
Doctor?

240
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,375
If you're picking up
my thoughts, you'd know.

241
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,166
You can do that, can't you?

242
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,875
Sometimes.

243
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,834
This must be what
Mother felt about you.

244
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,750
I believe we could read
each other eventually.

245
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,709
Can I take that
as a compliment?

246
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,250
Absolutely.

247
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,417
I only ever felt this...

248
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,709
Well, with, um,
someone who's on this ship.

249
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,542
Oh.

250
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:31,208
Do I have competition?

251
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,208
No.

252
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:38,250
What he wants most
is to captain a starship.

253
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,333
What I want is
to cure people.

254
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:46,125
Well, I'm a practicing
psychologist.

255
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,125
Maybe we could work
in concert.

256
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,000
We are going to be together a
long time.

257
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,917
Yes.

258
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:57,208
That is the point
of marriage, I suppose.

259
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,375
I really thought
you'd tell me

260
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,000
you were an artist.

261
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,166
I just felt your mind
very much on these.

262
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,583
They are your work,
aren't they?

263
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,625
I can see it would
be very hard

264
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,709
to keep secrets from you.

265
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,834
This is why you
were surprised

266
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,959
when you first saw me.

267
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,750
This woman...

268
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,542
you thought I would be
this woman.

269
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,333
I have seen this face

270
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,083
ever since I was a boy.

271
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,709
When I close
my eyes at night

272
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:42,250
I could hear her
whispering my name.

273
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,667
And knowing you
were Betazoid,

274
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,125
I just assumed it was you

275
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,333
projecting yourself
into my mind.

276
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,792
I'm sorry I'm not
what you hoped for...

277
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,166
No.

278
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,625
Please don't mistake
a childish fantasy

279
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,542
for disappointment.

280
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,417
You are so beautiful.

281
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,458
I feel honored.

282
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,667
You've no idea who she is?

283
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,750
It doesn't really matter now.

284
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:33,375
<i>Captain's Personal Log:</i>
<i>I trust my concern</i>

285
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,750
<i>over the problems</i>
<i>of ship's Counselor Troi</i>

286
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,125

287
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,834
<i>But it seems to me</i>
<i>that she is trapped</i>

288
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,709

289
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,917
<i>which the facts</i>
<i>of 24th-century life</i>

290
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:48,166

291
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,750
<i>I wish I could intervene.</i>

292
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,291
On the viewer, Captain.

293
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,667
Unidentified vessel
traveling at sub-warp speed.

294
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,083
Bearing 235.7.

295
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,208
Sub-warp?
It's several hours away then.

296
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,166
Let's take a look at it.

297
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,959
Enlarge to maximum.

298
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:10,208
Increasing magnification, sir.

299
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:18,417
Mr. Data, is that
the trouble I believe it is?

300
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:21,500
If you mean
a Tarellian vessel, sir,

301
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,417
it is.

302
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,959
I thought the Tarellians
were all dead.

303
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:30,333
What are the poor devils
doing here?
Picard to Sick Bay.

304
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,333
Dr. Crusher to Bridge.
Urgent.

305
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,083
They must not be permitted
to destroy us

306
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,792
or the planet.

307
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,667
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

308
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,625
<i>It has been believed the</i>
<i>Tarellian race was extinct,</i>

309
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,583
<i>an assumption</i>
<i>contradicted now</i>

310
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:54,709
<i>by the sight of one of their</i>
<i>vessels approaching Haven.</i>

311
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:56,792
The fact that it's traveling
at its present velocity

312
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,250
suggests a possible answer.

313
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,000
A damaged vessel, sir.
That could explain it.

314
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,834
If it was unable
to reach warp speed

315
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:04,375
it would have taken
all these years to get here.

316
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,750
Go on with your
briefing, Mr. Data.

317
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,166
Tarella was class M,
much like your Earth

318
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,041
with similar
humanoid life-forms.

319
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,375
Unfortunately,
they faced the old story

320
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,250
of hatred overpowering
intelligence.

321
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,000
PICARD:
There were hostilities?

322
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,375
Between the inhabitants
of their two land masses

323
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,041
resulting in one group

324
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,417
unleashing a deadly biological
weapon on the other.

325
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:25,709
And in the end, the other
becoming infected as well.

326
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:29,542
It makes one question
the sanity of humanoid forms.

327
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:32,417
Can you identify the origin
of the infection, Doctor?

328
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,208
The Tarellians
had reached Earth's

329
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,041
late 20th century
level of knowledge.

330
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,375
That's all you need
if you're a damned fool.

331
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,792
A deadly infectious virus,
which, at that modest level

332
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:42,959
of knowledge,
is not difficult to grow.

333
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:46,375
We learned the rest of
the story in security training.

334
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,041
Some Tarellians made
it to other worlds

335
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,709
only to die along with
populations they infected.

336
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:53,125
It's pretty well covered in
Academy training now, Captain.

337
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,208
Many of them tried to avoid
other civilized worlds
as they escaped,

338
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,458
only to be hunted down
and destroyed anyway.

339
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:02,417
Hmm... and it was believed
that the last Tarellian ship

340
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,875
was destroyed eight years ago
by the Alcyones.

341
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,083
Yes, sir.

342
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,625
Exactly when will
they reach Haven?

343
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,125
Exactly 13 hours, nine minutes,
22 seconds, 350...

344
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,917
Thank you.

345
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:17,000
Which creates a very difficult
problem for the<i> Enterprise.</i>

346
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,583
Our treaty requires us
to protect Haven

347
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,417
and Federation policy
requires

348
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:24,667
that we assist
life-forms in need...

349
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:27,834
which must include
the Tarellians.

350
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:31,208
I shall want you
to help me find some answers.

351
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,291
Thank you.

352
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,625
However,
there will be ample time

353
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,208
for your second assignment--

354
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,166
voluntary, of course--
the pre-joining announcement

355
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,417
of Counselor
Deanna Troi...

356
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,250
...and Wyatt Miller.

357
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,625
We've talked it
over, Captain,

358
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,375
and the ceremony will be
tomorrow, if you agree.

359
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,083
And, Captain,
would it be possible

360
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,208
for you to perform
the ceremony?

361
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,041
Well, yes, of course,
if all parties request it.

362
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,959
All parties
do not request it.

363
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,625
It's simply out
of the question.

364
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,750
I'm sorry, Captain,
but unfortunately,

365
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,417
you are not practiced in
the ways of Betazed joining.

366
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,000
No, that's quite true.

367
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,834
Therefore, you are
totally unqualified.

368
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:28,542
He is qualified to lead
a traditional Earth ceremony

369
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,583
which is what
this will be.

370
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,750
Here, I thought you had
no sense of humor.

371
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,125
An Earth wedding?
Ridiculous.

372
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,333
My family and I
are living on Earth now.

373
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,834
So, that's why you want
that backward ritual.

374
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,709
Terrible, Captain, to see
a woman go downhill like this.

375
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:45,750
Mother!

376
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,875
Downhill?

377
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,417
The matter is settled.

378
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:51,500
Mr. Homn will
conduct the joining.

379
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,000
But... but Homn
can't even talk.

380
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,417
No matter.

381
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:58,500
He is highly adept
in act of sign language.

382
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,959
The matter is closed.

383
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:03,583
Who are you to tell us
what we should do?

384
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,667
Your ignorance is astonishing.

385
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,583
I am Lwaxana Troi,

386
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,917
Daughter of
the Fifth House,

387
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:11,542
Holder of the Sacred
Chalice of Rixx,

388
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:13,542
Heir to the Holy Rings
of Betazed.

389
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,125
Who are you?

390
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,583
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is a Starfleet tradition

391
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,875
that at social
gatherings

392
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,959
disputes are
not permitted.

393
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:25,208
I hereby declare, therefore,
all disagreements resolved.

394
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,083
Here, here.

395
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,208
A toast:

396
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,709
to the young couple
and their families.

397
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:43,792
And?

398
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:46,959
And may this union be

399
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,667
a productive one.

400
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,125
Here, here.

401
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:09,417
Considering the rate
at which you imbibe, sir,

402
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:13,458
is your lineage
at all mixed with human?

403
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:23,250
Is it true, Captain,
that there's a Tarellian ship

404
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,667
headed for Haven?

405
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:27,208
(<i> gong sounds</i> )

406
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,083
Yes, it is true.

407
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,917
WYATT:
That's amazing.

408
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:35,417
I've read everything
I could about them.

409
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,458
Biological virus
analysis was

410
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,166
a favorite subject
at medical school.

411
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:42,125
In which case, I'd very much
like to confer with you.

412
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,542
I'm pleased to have
a medical colleague on board.

413
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:48,625
WYATT:
Yes, ma'am...

414
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,083
...um, Doctor.

415
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,583
(<i> gong sounds</i> )
Would it
be possible

416
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,333
to prepare some
medical needs geared toward

417
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,917
the Tarellian probable needs?

418
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:58,792
We could beam it over
without any fear of infection.

419
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,000
What do you think,
Doctor?

420
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,709
(<i> gong sounds</i> )

421
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,583
It's a very
considerate idea.

422
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,792
Our Sick Bay is at
your disposal, Doctor.

423
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,041
Thank you.

424
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,208
Mr. Data.

425
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:15,959
Sir?

426
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:18,709
You're circling the room
like a buzzard.

427
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,834
Perhaps being human
yourself, sir,

428
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:27,375
you do not find them as...
(<i> gong sounds</i> )

429
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,709
...intriguing as I.

430
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:35,000
Must he do that?

431
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,250
As you well know,
it is the Betazed way

432
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,583
of giving thanks
for the food we eat.

433
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,417
You, giving thanks?

434
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,250
Besides, you never
did this before.

435
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,500
I do it now.

436
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,166
Unlike some people,
I am in growth.

437
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:01,750
Victoria,

438
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,375
I've forgotten whether
you enjoy pets or not.

439
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:08,917
Love them, of course.

440
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:11,417
Good.

441
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,417
(<i> chittering</i> )

442
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,750
(<i> screams</i> )

443
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,291
Gently, gently.

444
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,583
Poor baby,
did she hurt you?

445
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:32,000
Captain, if you'll excuse me

446
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,291
I'd like to spend
some time considering...

447
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:36,208
the Tarellian situation.

448
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:37,500
Yes, of course.

449
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,625
Ladies and gentlemen.

450
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,083
Mrs. Troi,

451
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,291
I'm very interested in the
Betazed ceremony you mentioned.

452
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:54,583
Could you tell us more?

453
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,917
Why, I'd be delighted,
Commander.

454
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:58,667
It's an ancient ceremony

455
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:01,583
widely regarded as the most
beautiful in the universe.

456
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,583
After the young couple
have removed their clothing...

457
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,583
The bride and groom go naked?

458
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,750
All guests must
go unclothed.

459
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,500
It honors the act of love
being celebrated.

460
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,083
(<i> coughs</i> )

461
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,417
No, you needn't
worry too much, dear.

462
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,792
Your body's
not that bad.

463
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:19,000
Besides, your husband
quite likes the idea

464
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,959
of seeing me unclothed.

465
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,083
Steven!

466
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,250
Oh, you did know

467
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,166
he's attracted to me,
didn't you?

468
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,083
Untrue. I don't...

469
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,959
Stop this petty bickering,
all of you!

470
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:32,667
Especially you, Mother!

471
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,917
(<i> gong sounds</i> )

472
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:51,959
Could you please continue
the petty bickering?

473
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:54,000
I find it most intriguing.

474
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:27,125
May I join you?

475
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:45,792
I will miss you, Deanna.

476
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,917
I am no longer<i> Imzadi</i> to you?

477
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,542
You taught me that word
means "my beloved."

478
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:54,959
And the human heart
is too small

479
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,709
to permit that
feeling now?

480
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,500
Have you discussed
this with Wyatt?

481
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,667
I think you should.

482
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,834
It's also
damned unfair to me.

483
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:06,375
I understand.

484
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,166
I should have realized.

485
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:12,834
Humans, young human
males particularly,

486
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:15,041
have difficulty separating

487
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,959
platonic love
and physical love.

488
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,291
The problem is...

489
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,500
<i>Imzadi...</i>

490
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,208
I couldn't.

491
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,583
Not now.

492
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:30,417
Call it an old...
an old Earth tradition

493
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,792
habit of the beasts...

494
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:35,250
whatever.

495
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,458
Hello, you two.

496
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,959
We were just talking
about you, Wyatt.

497
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,250
This is incredible!

498
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,417
Yes.

499
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,125
And in that discussion, I...

500
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:47,792
Actually...

501
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,834
Bill was concerned
that you might be upset

502
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:53,500
that I cared deeply
for him, too.

503
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,583
Oh, you're the one who wants
to be a starship captain.

504
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:59,750
Yes, I've heard that
bonding or marriage

505
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,709
would complicate
things in that case.

506
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:04,333
To each his own.

507
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,166
Good luck with
that ambition.

508
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:10,417
And I very much respected
what you did tonight.

509
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,083
All I did was lose my temper.

510
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,959
If you'll excuse me.

511
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,083
Of course.

512
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,000
Running all this
is a big job.

513
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:29,625
In fact, you shamed them
into compromise.

514
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,291
So they've decided

515
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:37,291
that the joining will be
half Betazed, half Earth.

516
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,792
The Captain will
do the ceremony

517
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:42,583
and Mr. Homn will
be my best man.

518
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,333
And we'll take
half our clothes off?

519
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:48,875
Some of us still go naked.

520
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:50,125
You do.

521
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,125
I do.

522
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,667
Your mother,
my father,

523
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,709
but not my mother
or the guests.

524
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:58,959
Captain Picard will be
very relieved.

525
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:01,000
How did you manage it?

526
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,625
Your mother relented.

527
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:08,625
And I just caught my father

528
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:11,250
practicing naked
in front of his mirror.

529
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,458
(<i> laughing</i> )

530
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,709
And, so...

531
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:30,291
a question I should
have asked before...

532
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:36,250
Deanna, do you really want
to go through with this?

533
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,125
Yes.

534
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,291
I want to.

535
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:47,250
I'm a very lucky man.

536
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:09,583
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

537
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:13,291
<i>All attempts at warning off the</i>
<i>Tarellian ship have failed.</i>

538
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,667
<i>They still refuse</i>
<i>to communicate</i>

539
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,500
<i>and I'm growing concerned.</i>

540
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,333
How can you be certain
they're receiving us?

541
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:23,583
Because our sensors are
showing a responder echo, sir,

542
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,750
on the frequency
they once used.

543
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,250
We have a message, sir,
coming in from Haven.

544
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,041
On viewer.

545
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,750
Captain, the plague ship is
approaching transporter range.

546
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,625
PICARD:
We are aware of
that, Electorine.

547
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,208
Do you realize

548
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,208
that they can turn
this wonderful world of ours

549
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,750
into a graveyard?

550
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,291
Please!

551
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:48,333
Please take action now,
before it's too late.

552
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,875
We recognize your situation.

553
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,291
Please destroy them now!

554
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:54,542
We will not fire on them,
Electorine.

555
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,542
You must!

556
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,208
I'm certain I could
disable their ship

557
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,041
with a phaser
burst, Captain.

558
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,625
And then, Lieutenant?

559
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:12,542
DATA:
They're within
transporter range, sir.

560
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:15,208
Then we can't delay
any longer.

561
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:18,250
Ready the tractor beam,
Lieutenant Yar.

562
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,250
Target the ship.
Activate on my command.

563
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,792
Tractor beam ready.

564
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:24,709
Engage.

565
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:31,709
Got them, sir.

566
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:34,041
Do we have them securely,
Lieutenant?

567
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:35,959
Can they beam onto the planet?

568
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,125
Negative, sir.

569
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,709
They can't leave that ship.

570
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:40,375
I know they can
receive us, Captain.

571
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,166
At this distance,
they could respond

572
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,959
with running lights
if necessary.

573
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,875
Unless they
have all died.

574
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:48,625
Their ship could have been
brought in by automation.

575
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,000
Captain!

576
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:19,583
It's the woman
in Wyatt's drawings.

577
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:30,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41294.6:</i>

578
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:33,417
<i>Orbiting Haven</i>
<i>with a Tarellian vessel</i>

579
00:33:33,417 --> 00:33:35,375

<i>to appear on the plague ship?</i>

583

<i>Enterprise</i> to Tarellian vessel,
are you receiving us?

584
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:56,166
My name is Wrenn.

585
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,542
And before I inquire

586
00:33:57,542 --> 00:34:01,291
why your tractor beam
has trapped us here,

587
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,542
is there one aboard
your vessel named Wyatt?

588
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:08,625
Captain, I don't understand.

589
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:14,083
It's astounding.
Ariana was right.

590
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,792
He is here, daughter.

591
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:19,750
Wyatt, you've come
just as you promised.

592
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,083
How could I be so accurate?

593
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,000
Except for the dream images,
I've never seen her.

594
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,166
Sir, our concern
is with the threat

595
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,500
your vessel poses
to the planet below

596
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,875
if you're still carrying

597
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,083
the infection that
destroyed your world.

598
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,125
Oh, we still
carry it, Captain.

599
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:42,792
My daughter, I...
all eight of us.

600
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,041
Eight?

601
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,875
All of us that
are left, Captain.

602
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,500
Most of the rest passed on
during the years

603
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,542
that it took to reach Haven.

604
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:55,000
If you've come here
because of the legend

605
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,125
about planet Haven
miraculously healing the sick...

606
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,166
We don't ask to make contact
with those living below.

607
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:07,166
All we ask is to be
on the edge of some sea,

608
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,792
some unpopulated island
or far away peninsula.

609
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:12,000
This is not
our planet, sir,

610
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,458
but I will present
your needs

611
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,375
to those who do
govern this world.

612
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:19,917
Present the fact that we intend
to die here, Captain.

613
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:25,959
And if we die while caged
by your tractor beam...

614
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,500
so be it.

615
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,083
(<i> door chime</i> )

616
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:46,125
Oh, Wyatt, how do you like
my new hairstyle?

617
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:49,041
Of course, it's going to
look much better on me
when I'm naked.

618
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:51,417
Mrs. Troi, may I talk to you
about something serious?

619
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:53,375
Oh, but I'm always serious,
dear boy.

620
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,542
Only my pleasant nature
makes it appear otherwise.

621
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:57,375
Please, Mrs. Troi!

622
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:01,750
Yes, that was puzzling.

623
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,417
A woman out of another place

624
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,125
who insists
that she knows you.

625
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,750
And...
And whom you've dreamed of
all these years.

626
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,750
And I was hoping the way
you handled thoughts...

627
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,542
Fascinating, Wyatt, how easily
your thoughts come through.

628
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:26,250
The answer to the puzzle
of Ariana and you is so simple.

629
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,000
It's too simple for
most humans to understand.

630
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,583
Too simple?
Of course.

631
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,709
It's something they all
know instinctively

632
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:34,208
yet go to great effort
to reject

633
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,000
or build complicated
superstitions about.

634
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,834
All life, Wyatt,
all consciousness

635
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:42,375
is indissolubly
bound together.

636
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:45,125
Indeed, it's all part
of the same thing.

637
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,667
Yes!

638
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:49,834
I have wondered
if something like that...

639
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,000
...that weren't so.

640
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:58,000
And no doubt
so has Ariana,

641
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
which helped the two of you
to make contact.

642
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,458
Wyatt, tell me
something seriously.

643
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,834
Which of these would
look best on me naked?

644
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,166
Wyatt.

645
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,500
Are you feeling
all right?

646
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,208
Just wedding nerves.

647
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,709
The supplies are ready.

648
00:37:35,709 --> 00:37:37,250
I'll take them
to the transporter room.

649
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,917
I'll notify
the Captain they're ready.

650
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,333
VICTORIA:
Look at your father, Wyatt.

651
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,625
He just can't wait to
strip off his clothes

652
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,709
for that barbaric
ceremony.

653
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:11,500
Please take care
of each other.

654
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,917
You are beautiful...

655
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:28,792
but you looked the best of all
in the desert on the Holodeck...

656
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,375
when we did this.

657
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:03,208
You can put
the supplies on the pad.

658
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,667
Dr. Crusher had me
set the coordinates.

659
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:07,959
All we need is
the Captain's order.

660
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:25,083
Captain, someone's transporting
over to the Tarellian ship.

661
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,208
Override.

662
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,583
I can't, sir.
It's too late.

663
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,000
Hello, Wyatt.

664
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,834
We always thought
you were a dream.

665
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:25,250
You're not surprised.

666
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:30,166
Did you know I'd beam over?

667
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:33,709
Once we saw you were real,
we knew.

668
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:36,542
You are a doctor.

669
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:41,041
Yes, I've brought
medicines and supplies.

670
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:45,542
And I knew you
would be this brave.

671
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:57,917
How could you
let this happen?

672
00:40:57,917 --> 00:41:01,542
My son surrounded by
those horrible lepers.

673
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,875
Mrs. Miller, if I could have
prevented this, I would...

674
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,083
Beam him back.

675
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:07,583
He can never come back,
Mrs. Miller.

676
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:11,750
You may turn off
your tractor beam, Captain.

677
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,166
We will not be going to Haven.

678
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:21,000
We have what we
really came for.

679
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:23,375
Wyatt!

680
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:26,583
Mother, Father...

681
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:30,291
forgive me, but I must...

682
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:34,583
I'm going to try to continue
the work to cure these people.

683
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:36,959
And Wyatt will do it.

684
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:39,625
I've believed
that all along.

685
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:44,750
I knew I was coming to Haven
to meet my destiny.

686
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,917
I thought it was
to be with you, Deanna,

687
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:52,709
but it was Ariana
who drew me here.

688
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:55,291
I'm sorry.

689
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:58,375
Wyatt, I'm happy for you.

690
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:01,000
And for Ariana, too.

691
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,250
You've done very well
for a human, Wyatt.

692
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,250
Mother.

693
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:11,500
Captain... my respects.

694
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,917
And mine, sir.

695
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:21,583
Good-bye.

696
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:34,125
Keep the chest.

697
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:36,333
You'll have use
for it someday.

698
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:53,125
Oh, it seems such a shame
to waste the whole trip.

699
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,500
Perhaps I should stay
and be joined to a new mate.

700
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,792
What?

701
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:59,166
Well, the Captain is
highly attracted to me,

702
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:02,166
but he's a
little too old.

703
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,709
Perhaps I should choose you.

704
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:07,417
He has other obligations,
Mother.

705
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:09,875
Oh, very well.

706
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:11,709
It's his loss.

707
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:17,792
Mr. Homn.

708
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:25,041
Thank you
for the drinks.

709
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:37,250
<i>Try and remember</i>
<i>your heritage, little one.</i>

710
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:50,583
Captain! Even Xelo never had
such thoughts about me.

711
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:52,542
You may energize.

712
00:43:57,959 --> 00:44:01,208
That was meant
as a joke, Captain.

713
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,166
I was not amused.

714
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,583
Take us out of here, Mr. Riker.

715
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:09,417
Aye, sir.

716
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:10,917
Warp two, helm.

717
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:14,709
Heading 5-7, mark 3-1-9.

718
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:19,125
Our destiny is elsewhere...

719
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:23,583
but I'm happy that yours
is here with us, Counselor.

720
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:26,333
Warp two, sir,
heading 5-7,

721
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,542
mark 3-1-9.

722
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,458
Engage.
