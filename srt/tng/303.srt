00:00:01,542 --> 00:00:05,375
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43152.4.</i>

2
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:08,959
<i>We are cautiously entering</i>
<i>the Delta Rana star system</i>

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,542
<i>three days after receiving</i>
<i>a distress call</i>

4
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,959
<i>from the Federation colony</i>
<i>on its fourth planet.</i>

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,500
<i>The garbled transmission</i>

6
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:17,166
<i>reported the colony</i>
<i>under attack</i>

7
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,166
<i>from an unidentified</i>
<i>spacecraft.</i>

8
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,041
<i>Our mission is one of rescue</i>

9
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:26,208
<i>and if necessary, confrontation</i>
<i>with a hostile force.</i>

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,875
Shields up,
maximum strength.

11
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:30,291
Shields up.

12
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,000
Sensors do not indicate

13
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,834
the presence of any
armed space vehicles

14
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,917
operating within
the Rana system.

15
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:38,500
They could be cloaked
or otherwise shielded.

16
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,083
Mr. Crusher, bring us in

17
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,625
well clear of
the planet's three moons.

18
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,125
WESLEY:
Aye, sir.

19
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,583
Captain, we
are not receiving
Rana IV's call sign.

20
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,333
Open a frequency
to colony operations.

21
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,709
(<i> communications beep</i> )

22
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,875
No response.

23
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:53,583
Rana IV is
emissions quiet.

24
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:58,041
Captain, there are 11,000
inhabitants in this colony.

25
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,083
At this range,
I should be sensing something.

26
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,667
I'm not.

27
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:08,625
Mr. Data, put the planet
on the main viewer.

28
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,750
PICARD:
Magnify.

29
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,041
My God.

30
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:20,792
Helm, put us
in high equatorial orbit.

31
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:22,542
Scan for survivors.

32
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,750
Sensors are scanning
90 degrees of longitude

33
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:26,917
as we orbit.

34
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,709
I am detecting no
bodies of water

35
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,041
no vegetation, no
artificial structures.

36
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,500
Life-form readings are negative.

37
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,041
Could the colonists
have escaped?

38
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,542
DATA:
That is highly unlikely.

39
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,625
Rana IV possessed
no interstellar spacecraft.

40
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:43,583
Who would cause devastation
on that order?

41
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,500
WESLEY:
Hold it.

42
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:48,333
Captain, I've got
something here.

43
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,208
37 degrees north

44
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,750
and 62 degrees east.

45
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,792
It's a structure.

46
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,000
Life?

47
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,959
Two life-forms...
possibly human.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,291
Put that area on
the main viewer
and magnify.

49
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,208
DATA:
The structure is located

50
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,917
at the center
of the vegetation, sir.

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,458
An entire planet
obliterated

52
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,834
except for a few acres
of trees and grass

53
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:14,959
and one building?

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,125
It must be
some kind of illusion.

55
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,375
DATA:
Negative.

56
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,834
It is as you see it.

57
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,917
Number One, I think
you had better see

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,792
who's at home.

59
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:59,542
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

60
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:03,542
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

61
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,542
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

62
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:09,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

63
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:13,417
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

64
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:18,250
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

65
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,375
If they're the only survivors
of a nuclear holocaust

66
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,208
they can't be
in very good shape.

67
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,542
I understand.

68
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,792
Counselor?

69
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:37,333
What I sense
of them is human.

70
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,750
And something else?

71
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,834
It's difficult
to explain.

72
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,500
I feel
there's something different

73
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:46,834
about these two people.

74
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,959
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,625
I can't be clearer
than that.

76
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,709
(<i> door opens</i> )

77
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,041
We're ready.

78
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,041
Good luck, Number One.

79
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,583
Energize.

80
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,333
Geordi, what can
you tell me?

81
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:36,208
The house is a typical
settlement structure

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,792
with adaptations.

83
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:41,250
Thermal properties all seem
to conform to known materials.

84
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,667
DATA:
If there are
any indicators

85
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,000
as to why
this particular area

86
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,709
has remained intact,
I cannot detect them.

87
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,417
Worf, the interior
of the house.

88
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,750
There is one individual

89
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,709
located at the south
end of the house

90
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,166
the other toward
the north.

91
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,166
There is a weapon--

92
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,875
a low-yield phaser,
nonfunctional

93
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:01,208
in proximity to the
front room individual.

94
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,959
I guess a frontal assault
is unwarranted.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,458
Stay here.

96
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,917
I think I'll try
an old-fashioned
knock on the door.

97
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,291
Commander, wait!

98
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,125
There's something concealed
under the surface...

99
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,875
(<i> yells</i> )

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,333
MAN:
What are you doing there?

101
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,000
This is private property.
Who are you people?

102
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,834
I'm Commander William Riker
of the USS<i> Enterprise</i>

103
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,166
crew members.

104
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,166
May I come down
and approach you?

105
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,250
You leave him right
where he is.

106
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,208
Should I incapacitate
him, Commander?

107
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,291
No.

108
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,208
We're a rescue party.

109
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,583
We picked up
your colony's distress call

110
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,583
and we came
as fast as we could.

111
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,291
Kevin.

112
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,291
Kevin, what are
you doing?

113
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,792
Can't you see they're
here to help us?

114
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,041
Can't you see
they're human?

115
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,333
Go back in the house, Rishon.

116
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,458
This could be
some kind of a trick.

117
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,250
We had almost given up hope.

118
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,041
We were afraid maybe the whole
Federation had been attacked.

119
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,792
What about the colony?

120
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,458
Do you know
of any other survivors?

121
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,458
It's been days since we've seen
or heard from anybody.

122
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,875
No, don't. Don't tell me
that we're the only ones.

123
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,291
They came in a
spaceship so big

124
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,625
you could see
it in orbit.

125
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,166
They took our world
apart piece by piece.

126
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,625
Who?

127
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,709
We don't know.

128
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,875
We never saw
their faces.

129
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:22,417
You don't know
where they came from

130
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,375
where they are now?

131
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:26,458
I guess they've
gone away.

132
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,250
(<i> gasping</i> )
Oh, I'm sorry.

133
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,458
I'm only performing
a physical.

134
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,250
Could I have your names, please,
just for the record.

135
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,625
I'm Rishon Uxbridge

136
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,500
and this is my husband Kevin.

137
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:37,750
DATA:
Botanists

138
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,125
originally from
the aquatic city

139
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,166
New Martim Vaz,
in Earth's Atlantic Ocean

140
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,792
residents of the Rana IV colony
for five years.

141
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,250
You, madam,
are 82 years of age

142
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,709
and a composer
of Tao-classical music.

143
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,959
You, sir,
are 85 years of age

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,834
and a specialist
in symbiotic plant life.

145
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,000
You have been married
for 53 years.

146
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:59,333
I memorized the colony register
on the way to Rana IV

147
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,917
in the event that such
information would be needed.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,792
Is something wrong?

149
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:09,959
With your permission

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,875
I'd like to look
inside of the house.

151
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:15,375
Why? What could interest you
in there?

152
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:18,417
Mr. Uxbridge, as
far as we've been
able to determine

153
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,083
you and your wife
and this house

154
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,208
are all that
survived that attack.

155
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,250
Now that's either
a bizarre coincidence

156
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,834
or by design

157
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,000
and I don't favor
the coincidence theory.

158
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,041
Are you saying that we were
kept alive intentionally?

159
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,542
Yes.

160
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,917
I don't understand.

161
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:37,500
You don't think Rishon
and I did something

162
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,917
that merits survival, do you?

163
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,709
I mean, betrayed the others?

164
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,458
I'm not accusing you
of anything, Mr. Uxbridge.

165
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,834
The attacking force spared
you for some reason.

166
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,333
We'd like to know why.

167
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,500
Now, may I go inside?

168
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,583
I'll make everyone
a nice cup of tea.

169
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,750
We have lovely tea
here on Rana.

170
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:09,709
It grows wild
almost everywhere...

171
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,291
WORF:
Sir.

172
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:16,208
May I say your
attempt to hold the
away team at bay

173
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,500
with a nonfunctioning
weapon was an act
of unmitigated gall.

174
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:24,500
Didn't fool you, huh?

175
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,792
I admire gall.

176
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,875
Go ahead.
Pick it up.

177
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,792
(<i> waltz playing</i> )

178
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,625
It's a music box.

179
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,291
It's been in my family
for generations.

180
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,792
(<i> waltz continues</i> )

181
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,250
(<i> waltz continues faintly</i> )

182
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:00,083
(<i> waltz continues</i> )

183
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,125
There's nothing unusual
about this house

184
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,750
except the fact
that it's here.

185
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:09,250
What about them?

186
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,250
They are in reasonably
good health.

187
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,375
Both show signs
of stress--

188
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:13,542
which is understandable

189
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,709
considering what
they've been through.

190
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,083
Somehow they're different.

191
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,583
Let's get back to the ship.

192
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,041
We'll take them with us.

193
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,458
Excuse me, Mrs. Uxbridge

194
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,208
but we've got to return
to our ship now.

195
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,417
But I haven't
finished fixing
your tea, Commander.

196
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,083
I'm sorry,
but we've finished here.

197
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,291
Now, I can allow time
for you and Kevin to pack.

198
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,917
What do you mean, "pack"?

199
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,417
You're not thinking of taking us
with you, are you?

200
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,750
Surely you don't want
to remain here.

201
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,375
How could you take care
of yourselves?

202
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,166
Kevin, I can't
leave my home.

203
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,375
Don't let them
do this to us.

204
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:41,792
No one's going
to make us leave.

205
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:43,792
RIKER:
You'll be protected
on our ship.

206
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:46,083
You could still be
in danger here on Rana.

207
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,792
Commander, we appreciate
your concern

208
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,000
but we're not going anywhere.

209
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,208
We'll manage.
We always have.

210
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,375
All right, I can't make you
come with us.

211
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:00,333
Are you familiar
with one of these?

212
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,667
We'll be in the system

213
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:03,041
for the next several days,
at least.

214
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,500
If you reconsider,
please contact us.

215
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,125
We'll be fine,
Commander.

216
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,208
We have each other.

217
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,583
Are they collaborators?

218
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,375
Did they provide
the colony's assailants

219
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,375
with something that abetted

220
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:28,375
the total destruction
of Rana IV

221
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,500
in order to protect
their own lives?

222
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:33,166
What could two botanists
in their 80s possess

223
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,750
that could possibly aid
whoever attacked the planet?

224
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,458
We don't know what
their enemy needed, Doctor.

225
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,750
Love, fear, hope.
(<i> hears the waltz playing</i> )

226
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:42,208
LA FORGE:
Maybe they're being
held hostage in some fashion.

227
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,208
CRUSHER:
No, nothing in
the tricorder readings

228
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,458
indicated they were under
that kind of stress.

229
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,208
PICARD:
Counselor?

230
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,333
Counselor Troi?

231
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,625
I'm sorry, um...

232
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,208
I don't sense them
well enough.

233
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,125
Number One,
you say the couple

234
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,083
is incapable
of sustaining themselves?

235
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,083
There's a fusion
reactor in the house

236
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,333
good for another
five years of power

237
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,458
but their water
table is tainted...

238
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,291
(<i> hears the waltz playing</i> )
...and they have nothing
to feed themselves

239
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,709
except for a small garden.

240
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,875
And they won't come
to the ship?

241
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,375
They were adamant about it.

242
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,041
Well, we'll do
what we can for them

243
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,667
but in the meantime

244
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,208
I want them kept
under surveillance.

245
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,166
I'm sorry,
I'm not feeling very well.

246
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,041
I'd like to go to my quarters.

247
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,583
By all means.

248
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,291
Is there anything I can do?

249
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:40,250
Captain, a search
of the Ranian system

250
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,875
has determined
that the hostile force

251
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:45,875
that attacked this planet
is no longer present.

252
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:49,250
I remember a Starfleet admiral
once saying the same thing

253
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,542
about some renegade Andorians
in the Triangular system.

254
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,291
It turns out that they had
dismantled their ship

255
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,792
and hidden it.

256
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:59,041
Those Andorians did
not have to contend

257
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,083
with someone
of my thoroughness.

258
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,500
I will stake
my reputation.

259
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,083
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

260
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,208
(<i> hears waltz playing</i> )

261
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:20,375
Don't listen.

262
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,417
Think of something else.

263
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,625
(<i> waltz continues playing</i> )

264
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:41,875
Stop! Please stop!

265
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,709
(<i> door chimes</i> )

266
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,625
(<i> music stops</i> )

267
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,583
Yes?

268
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,750
I was concerned.

269
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:00,917
I came to see
if I could be of any help.

270
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,917
I'm fine.

271
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,041
There's nothing wrong.

272
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,792
I'm just tired, that's all.

273
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:10,291
Now, I may not have your gifts
at reading emotions, Counselor

274
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,834
but I can tell
when someone is in pain

275
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,792
and hiding it.

276
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:17,333
It's so silly.

277
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:21,041
I hear music in my mind--

278
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,458
music that won't stop.

279
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,375
Perhaps it's a symptom
of fatigue.

280
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:29,000
We've all been inflicted,
one time or another

281
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,208
with that melody
that won't go away.

282
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,625
No. It's deeper than that.

283
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,709
The song doesn't stop
for an instant.

284
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,917
It plays in perfect clarity

285
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,667
from beginning to end,
over and over again.

286
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,125
I don't even
know what song it is.

287
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,291
I never heard it before.

288
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,208
When did this start?

289
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,583
A few hours ago, while the away
team was on the surface.

290
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,083
I was trying to...

291
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,250
I was thinking
of Rishon and Kevin.

292
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,917
Rishon and Kevin, and...?

293
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,333
I can't explain it,
Captain.

294
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,792
They're elusive.

295
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:12,333
They're...

296
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,375
I'm... I'm sorry.

297
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,667
Well, try and rest.

298
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:24,709
Take the necessary sleep
inducements if you have to.

299
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,750
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

300
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,000
Data, give us a visual.

301
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,041
Magnification factor 50.

302
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,542
WESLEY:
Look at the size of that.

303
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,083
Now where did
that come from?

304
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,083
Apparently, it was riding
a Lagrange point

305
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,709
hiding behind Rana IV's
furthest moon.

306
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,208
Our vehicle
classification index

307
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,500
can put no identity to it.

308
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:55,625
Its design
is completely foreign.

309
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:56,875
RIKER:
But that's our boy.

310
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,542
Approximately five times
our mass

311
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,834
and carrying enough armament
to pulverize a planet.

312
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,458
Lieutenant?

313
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:09,417
I, uh... cannot
explain this, Captain.

314
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,166
RIKER:
It's heading for the planet.

315
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,458
Hailing frequencies.

316
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,917
Open.

317
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,333
Mr. Data, ask them

318
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:20,125
to identify themselves
and match our orbit.

319
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,083
They've received
the message, Captain

320
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,375
but are ignoring it.

321
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,500
Maximum shields. Ready
all weapon systems.

322
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:26,625
WORF:
Aye, sir.

323
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,542
RIKER:
It's assuming an attack posture.

324
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,375
Don't be surprised if...

325
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:35,250
The vessel is firing
jacketed streams

326
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,291
of positrons and antiprotons.

327
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,291
Equivalent firepower:
40 megawatts.

328
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,917
Shields are holding.

329
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,125
Again, 40 megawatts.
No damage.

330
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,917
Well, if that's the best
they can do

331
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,458
this should last
about five minutes.

332
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,458
Mr. Worf, let's raise
our voice a little.

333
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,458
Fire phasers.

334
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,166
Just a warning shot.

335
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,542
Mr. Data, invite
them to stand to.

336
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:06,917
The vessel
has assumed a position

337
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,583
outside of the Rana system

338
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,166
and it is rapidly
increasing velocity.

339
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,667
Helm, initiate pursuit.

340
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,333
Aye, sir.

341
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,625
The vessel has reached warp two

342
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,959
and continues on
a steady acceleration curve.

343
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,417
We're not getting
any closer, Commander.

344
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,792
Give us a superior curve,
Mr. Crusher.

345
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,458
Warp three, warp four...

346
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,875
The warship continues to match
our acceleration curve

347
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,458
simultaneously point per point.

348
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,709
Warp 4.5, warp five, warp 5.5...

349
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,458
Riker to La Forge

350
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,417
give us everything you can
to close that gap, Geordi.

351
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:50,875
Yes, sir. I'll get you
to 9.37 in 15 seconds.

352
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,166
Warp 8.75, warp nine.

353
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,542
The warship
continues

354
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,625
to match our
acceleration
curve perfectly.

355
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:05,083
Number One, I have
the distinct impression

356
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,250
that we are
being toyed with.

357
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,834
Take us back to Rana IV.

358
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,959
Back?

359
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,375
We have unfinished
business there.

360
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,417
I need to have a talk
with those two people.

361
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,375
You have the Bridge.

362
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,083
Reduce speed.

363
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,709
Bring us around
on a return course.

364
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,875
This one's getting away.

365
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,083
Good afternoon.

366
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,500
I'm sorry
if I startled you.

367
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:44,333
I'm Jean-Luc Picard,
Captain of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

368
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,792
I have brought you something
you will need

369
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:50,959
if you're going
to stay on Rana IV.

370
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,834
It's a matter replicator.

371
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,333
It has limited
capabilities, but...

372
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,083
Thank you, but we have
no use for such a thing.

373
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,291
It will provide you
with clothing, food
and clean water.

374
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,375
Lieutenant Worf will demonstrate
its operation.

375
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:04,375
We don't need it.

376
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,166
Kevin, you know we do.

377
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,792
Thank you, Captain.

378
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:09,792
Kevin and I were about to have
afternoon tea.

379
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,875
You and Mr. Worf must join us.

380
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,500
I'd like that very much.

381
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,417
Rishon, they only
want to spy on us
like this morning.

382
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,750
Kevin Uxbridge

383
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,709
I have never turned anyone
away from this house

384
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,959
and I'm not going
to start now.

385
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,959
Captain?

386
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,291
Thank you.

387
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,792
Stop! Stop!
(<i> hears waltz playing</i> )

388
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:34,208
Please, I'll do anything.

389
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,792
Make it stop.

390
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:40,041
(<i> agonized groaning</i> )

391
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,750
Please.

392
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:43,792
Hey, I'm here to help.

393
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,458
It's so loud.

394
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,208
It's getting louder.

395
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,250
Please, I can't stand it.

396
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,792
Make it stop.

397
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,333
Move her to the bed.

398
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,166
This will help you relax.

399
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,750
(<i> music continues</i> )

400
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,208
I hear it.

401
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,667
It's still there.

402
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,959
It's so loud.

403
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,500
Take her to Sick Bay.

404
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:17,625
No, I want to stay
in my quarters.

405
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,333
I can get you to sleep.

406
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,625
I don't want to sleep.

407
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,208
The music will
only follow me.

408
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,875
I can induce delta sleep.

409
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:26,041
Block out even
your deepest dreams.

410
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,750
It's not a dream.

411
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:31,083
It's real.

412
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,375
Kevin and I first met each other
on a ship at sea.

413
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,500
He was a starving student

414
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:40,458
with this threadbare suit
and mismatched shoes.

415
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,333
I was traveling
with my parents

416
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,166
who did not like
the way that he
kept hanging around.

417
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:50,041
Two hours after I met him,
I asked him to marry me

418
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,041
and he knew I was serious.

419
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,875
I don't think that he's ever
recovered from that day.

420
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:01,542
Well, what do you think,
Mr. Worf?

421
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,375
Good tea...

422
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,750
nice house.

423
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:11,625
Why did you leave the Earth

424
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:15,667
and come to a brand-new planet
when you did?

425
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:19,583
You mean at our age?

426
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,083
Well, we thought

427
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,166
that it might make us
fall in love all over again.

428
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,875
It worked.

429
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,709
It must have been terrible
when the colony

430
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,333
was fighting for its life.

431
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,166
Yes, it was.

432
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,166
Fires lit the sky.

433
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,583
There was thunder, this...
this unbelievable thunder.

434
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,583
The ground
never stopped shaking.

435
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,417
And yet...

436
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,041
you survived.

437
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,709
We don't know
why we survived

438
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,750
and the others didn't.

439
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:49,417
I've tried to put
some purpose to it

440
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,041
but I can't.

441
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,625
I was wondering, Captain

442
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,834
when you and your ship
would be leaving.

443
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:58,041
I don't have
an answer for that.

444
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,750
A few hours ago,
we encountered a warship.

445
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:05,417
Possibly the one
that attacked you.

446
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,709
We forced it to leave the system

447
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,333
but we were not able
to affect it otherwise.

448
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,917
It could return.

449
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:18,291
Kevin, you said
it had gone away.

450
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,500
I guess I was wrong.

451
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:22,542
Now, don't worry.

452
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,542
It didn't hurt us before.

453
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,667
It won't hurt us now.

454
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:27,000
Do you know that
for a fact, Kevin?

455
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:31,917
No, but I don't enjoy seeing
my wife frightened.

456
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,667
We've told you time and again

457
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:36,166
we don't know why
we were spared.

458
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,500
But there had to be some reason.

459
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:42,542
In some way you were "different"
from the other colonists.

460
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:46,959
Your geographical location,
your philosophical beliefs...

461
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,792
the color of your eyes.

462
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:52,875
Some way, you were set apart
from them.

463
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:55,875
There was a difference.

464
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,709
I am a man
of special conscience.

465
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,583
While the others did
what they could

466
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,375
I chose not to fight.

467
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:05,083
Well, that is
your protected right.

468
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,834
But I can assure you
the attacking ship

469
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,291
had no way
of realizing this.

470
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,125
I expected to die
like all the others.

471
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,375
There's no reason

472
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:20,959
for you and your ship
to remain, Captain.

473
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,583
We can manage without you.

474
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:29,000
Kevin grieved for the others,
Captain, but he did nothing.

475
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,208
He is a very
gentle man.

476
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,000
You must understand that.

477
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,041
What about you, Rishon?

478
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,917
Is that how you feel?

479
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:44,667
I wanted to fight,
but I stayed with my husband.

480
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:48,834
Well, Captain, uh, thank you
again for the replicator.

481
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,333
I better clean up now.

482
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,583
Before we leave,
I ask you one more time

483
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,166
to come to the ship.

484
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,041
For your own safety.

485
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:06,417
Captain, I am frightened, but...

486
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:10,917
I can't leave Rana,
even if it means my life.

487
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,333
I don't understand it.

488
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,834
I've inhibited almost all
the activity of the neocortex

489
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:24,792
and she continues to behave
as if she's hearing the music.

490
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,208
We're going to have
to shield her

491
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,625
from all outside stimuli
by inducing coma.

492
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,583
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

493
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,041
I have a positive
identification, Commander.

494
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,208
It is the vessel
that attacked us earlier.

495
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,417
It is reentering the system
at high velocity

496
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,208
and is approaching Rana IV.

497
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,750
Give us a tight visual, Data.

498
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,250
RIKER:
Is it my imagination

499
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,166
or does it look
a lot meaner this time?

500
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:50,792
Shields up,
weapons ready.

501
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:53,375
Our friend is back.

502
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:54,542
I'm not surprised.

503
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:57,709
Mr. Worf, open
a hailing frequency.

504
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,834
Warn the vessel

505
00:24:58,875 --> 00:24:59,917
to stay clear
of the planet.

506
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,250
Aye, sir.

507
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,041
But they are already
within firing range.

508
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,208
WORF:
Shields are down.

509
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,709
Captain...

510
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,959
they hit us with 400 gigawatts
of particle energy.

511
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,875
Damage?
Superficial.

512
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:18,250
But I'm having trouble
reassembling the shields.

513
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,458
Shields down.

514
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,375
There's thermal damage
to the hull.

515
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:25,458
The warship is capable
of striking us

516
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,041
with far more
powerful bursts.

517
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,250
They're maneuvering
to come

518
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,875
between the<i> Enterprise</i>
and Rana IV.

519
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:33,417
Number One, we have been
exemplary in our patience.

520
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,709
Lieutenant Worf,
fire phasers on full

521
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,750
with a simultaneous
spread of torpedoes.

522
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,625
The vessel appears undamaged,
sir.

523
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,917
Its defenses
are apparently
able to absorb

524
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,792
incoming matter
and energy.

525
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:52,667
Commence rapid fire
with all weapons on full.

526
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,959
Shields down.

527
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,500
Internal damage.

528
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:05,792
Weapon systems control
has been lost.

529
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:06,834
Riker to Sick Bay.

530
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,041
Medical assistance
to the Bridge.

531
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,500
On our way, Commander.

532
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:12,709
Mr. Crusher, move the
<i>Enterprise</i> out of range

533
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,917
of the attacking vessel.

534
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,083
Aye, sir.

535
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,375
PICARD:
Mr. Worf?

536
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:35,417
The vessel has
terminated its pursuit.

537
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:36,959
It is assuming
an orbit

538
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,583
around Rana IV.

539
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,583
Kevin and Rishon?

540
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:44,125
We can't help them.

541
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,959
But it's my guess that
they're in no danger.

542
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:03,667
Can you help her?

543
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:05,417
I've done
everything I can.

544
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,959
I don't understand the
nature of this music

545
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,041
she says she's hearing,
or where it's coming from.

546
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,542
Could it be telepathic?

547
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:13,792
Yes, but I'm
not the expert

548
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,083
in determining that.

549
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:19,083
They're blocking
her sensitivity.

550
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,208
They're stopping her

551
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,083
from seeing
the truth.

552
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,750
CRUSHER:
Who's stopping her?

553
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,750
Kevin and Rishon.

554
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:27,458
What?

555
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,875
They wanted us
to leave Rana IV

556
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:32,583
and that's exactly
what we're doing.

557
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,417
Picard to Bridge.

558
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,875
RIKER:
Yes, Captain?

559
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:41,166
Number One, I want you
to maintain this course

560
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:42,750
for another hour

561
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,583
and then turn
the<i> Enterprise</i> around

562
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,458
and take her back to Rana IV.

563
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,834
We still won't have our shields
restored by then.

564
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,000
Take her back, Number One

565
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:54,709
and this time, nothing
is going to lure us away.

566
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:02,709
Sir, sensors indicate
no spacecraft

567
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,125
in the vicinity
of Rana IV, but, Captain...

568
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:06,500
Forget your previous
error, Mr. Worf.

569
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:08,291
There is no way
you could have
prevented it.

570
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:12,083
Captain, the Uxbridge house is
coming into transporter range.

571
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,667
Mr. Worf, will you
accompany me to the
Transporter Room?

572
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:15,875
You have the Bridge,
Number One.

573
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:17,709
Captain, I think
you should reconsider.

574
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,917
That warship has come
after us twice.

575
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:19,875
It could come back.

576
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:21,166
I disagree, Number One.

577
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:22,542
I don't think it
knows we're here.

578
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,959
I think that
it believes

579
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,166
that it has run
us off for good.

580
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:30,000
However, that will
all change once
I'm back on board.

581
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,166
Sir?

582
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:34,000
It's protecting
Kevin and Rishon.

583
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,458
It responds to their wishes

584
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,625
indirectly or directly,
I'm not sure

585
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,834
but that's what I'm
going to put to the test.

586
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,500
(<i> waltz playing</i> )

587
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:06,709
Celebrating?

588
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,750
What are you
doing here?

589
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,375
What do you want?

590
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,792
This is the second time
that you have

591
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:15,333
shown surprise
at my appearance.

592
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:18,000
The first time was
understandable, but now?

593
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:22,125
Unless it is because
you never expected
to see me again.

594
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:25,083
Why do you keep interfering
with our lives, Captain?

595
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,375
It is not my intention
to interfere

596
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:30,375
only to help you and Rishon.

597
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:33,583
Then, please, leave us alone.

598
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,375
I promise you
that when I leave this house

599
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,250
I will never
set foot in it again

600
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:40,458
but the<i> Enterprise</i> will remain
in orbit over the planet.

601
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,417
Why?

602
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:42,834
PICARD:
To protect you.

603
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,041
That's not necessary.

604
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,875
I thought you understood.

605
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:48,291
It is necessary.

606
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,959
You're in grave danger.

607
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,875
The warship has returned.

608
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:52,875
Kevin...

609
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,417
He's lying, Rishon.

610
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:57,083
We have fought
a pitched battle
with it and lost.

611
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,792
Many of my crew
have been injured

612
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:01,667
including a woman whose mind
is being slowly destroyed

613
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:03,500
by telepathic manipulation.

614
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,125
No. Please, no.

615
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:08,250
This is a form
of intimidation.

616
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:12,166
I have my rights.

617
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,667
Your rights?

618
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:16,417
What about Rishon?

619
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:19,834
Is she in favor
of being left here?

620
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,250
Come to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

621
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:25,709
Let me take you
where you'll be safe.

622
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,834
No.

623
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:31,583
I can't leave Kevin.

624
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,834
I'm staying.

625
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:38,250
She's safe here with me
in this house.

626
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,792
Why are you safe?

627
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:41,500
Why is this house a sanctuary?

628
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:43,041
Does it have to do with you?

629
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,667
With your refusal to fight?

630
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:48,291
Tell me this.

631
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:53,417
If Rishon were in danger,
would you kill to save her life?

632
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:59,709
No, not for her, not for anyone.

633
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,625
I will not kill.

634
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,000
Please, stop hurting him.

635
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:06,583
Captain, leave our house.

636
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:09,333
It is my sworn duty
to protect you.

637
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:13,500
The<i> Enterprise</i> will remain
in orbit around Rana IV

638
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:16,959
as long as the two of you
are alive.

639
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:30,709
Number One, an update, please?

640
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,583
Little change, Captain.

641
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,542
Our shields are
still inoperable.

642
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,500
We have partial control
of our weapons.

643
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:38,041
And I've doubled
the repair crews.

644
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,375
The warship is
approaching
from high orbit.

645
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,375
It is very close.

646
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:42,709
300,000 kilometers distant.

647
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,792
How is that possible?

648
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:44,834
Something wrong
with the sensors?

649
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,667
That's no concern,
Number One.

650
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:49,083
It's here and it's
precisely on schedule.

651
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,792
The vessel
has altered it's course

652
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:53,083
to a direct intercept
with the<i> Enterprise.</i>

653
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,792
Worf, arm phasers
and photon torpedoes.

654
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:56,792
Prepare to fire.

655
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,834
Belay those orders,
Mr. Worf.

656
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:03,959
The vessel is now
within 20,000 kilometers

657
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,667
of the<i> Enterprise</i>
and closing.

658
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:07,041
Let it come.

659
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,458
Let it come.

660
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:13,291
Activate the main viewer.

661
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,291
Evasive action, sir?

662
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,959
The<i> Enterprise</i> will hold
its position, Mr. Worf.

663
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,041
Weapons, sir?

664
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:25,000
On my orders,
not before.

665
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:36,250
The vessel is entering a
low orbit around Rana IV.

666
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:39,458
It appears to be
preparing to fire
at the planet, Captain.

667
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,583
Understood.

668
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,667
My calculations indicate

669
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:46,125
that its target is the house
of Kevin and Rishon Uxbridge.

670
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:49,583
There will be no interference
from us, Mr. Data.

671
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:59,583
The house has been obliterated.

672
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,583
Scan for survivors.

673
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,208
There are no survivors.

674
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:10,625
Mr. Worf...

675
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:13,542
prepare a photon torpedo.

676
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:17,417
Fire at the enemy vessel
when ready.

677
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:19,250
Aye, sir.

678
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:29,583
Number One, what reason
does the<i> Enterprise</i> have

679
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,875
for remaining at Rana?

680
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:34,166
The unknown vessel
has been destroyed.

681
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,500
The Uxbridges
have been destroyed.

682
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:39,375
There's no reason for the
<i>Enterprise</i> to remain.

683
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,417
Good.

684
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,458
Helm, move us
into higher orbit

685
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,000
so that we may
keep the surface

686
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:46,834
of the planet
under surveillance.

687
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:49,709
Aye, sir, but, Captain...

688
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,959
what are we watching for?

689
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,041
Anything, everything.

690
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:56,583
I'll be in my ready
room if I'm needed.

691
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:59,166
That will be
all for now.

692
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,083
(<i> door chimes</i> )

693
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,792
Come.

694
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:22,834
May I speak
with you, Captain?

695
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,917
It's my pleasure,
Number One.

696
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:27,667
We've been observing
this planet
very carefully

697
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:29,625
for three hours.
We've seen nothing.

698
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,709
I have the feeling
you're waiting for
something to happen.

699
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:42,583
Your Captain is acting
on an assumption, Will

700
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:46,083
and I'm not sure
what the result will be

701
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:50,458
or even that my assumption
is correct.

702
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,667
We found two people alive

703
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:58,083
in a house
on a devastated planet

704
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:02,834
but there was
only one survivor

705
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:07,417
of the war on Rana IV.

706
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:10,667
Why is it we maintain watch
on a planet

707
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,583
that is now totally dead?

708
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:16,667
(<i> console beeping</i> )

709
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:18,542
Bridge to Captain Picard.

710
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,083
You'd better come see this.

711
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:27,291
Captain, Commander,
the house is back.

712
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,750
Trees, grass,
everything.

713
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,792
Happened right
in front of us.

714
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:35,333
Mr. Worf, do you
see any survivors?

715
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:38,583
I detect two life-forms
inside the house.

716
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:42,291
It appears Kevin and Rishon
were not destroyed.

717
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,208
Helm, take us within
transporter range.

718
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,625
We're going to
beam them aboard

719
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:46,875
directly onto the Bridge.

720
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,709
But, Captain,
will they not protest?

721
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:53,000
Let them.

722
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,500
My apologies
if I interrupted a waltz.

723
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:06,041
Why have you
brought us here
against our will?

724
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:09,542
I want to end the suffering
of one of my crew members.

725
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:10,917
I don't understand.

726
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,542
Kevin does.

727
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,083
He's the cause.

728
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:16,792
At first,
I couldn't understand

729
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:18,000
why your house survived

730
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,709
the holocaust
when the others hadn't.

731
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,792
Then it occurred to me--

732
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:24,333
it<i> had</i> been destroyed.

733
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:27,250
That dwelling
where you served me tea

734
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:29,792
where you danced
your waltzes

735
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,709
is a reproduction.

736
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,875
Real to the touch,
but capable of being created

737
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:40,208
destroyed and created,
all in a whim.

738
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,917
You're joking
with us, Captain.

739
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:44,000
Can't you see, this
is hurting my husband.

740
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:48,250
Rishon, hear
what he has to say.

741
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,542
PICARD:
More than anything else

742
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,875
you wanted the<i> Enterprise</i>
away from Rana

743
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:54,542
because the house,
the plot of land

744
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,333
your very existence

745
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,625
were incongruities

746
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,041
that you were not prepared
to explain.

747
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,917
The warship, another recreation

748
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:06,500
tried to chase us away
twice and failed.

749
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:10,834
But when I came to your house
the second time

750
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,125
I provided you
with the only condition

751
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,375
that would make
the<i> Enterprise</i> leave--

752
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:16,834
your deaths.

753
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:21,333
You did your best
to satisfy that condition.

754
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:25,208
I'm deeply sorry
about the woman.

755
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,542
I will help her

756
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:31,583
but I must know what you intend
to do with me afterwards.

757
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,458
You'll be taken
to the nearest Starbase

758
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,917
and held responsible
for the attack on the<i> Enterprise</i>

759
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:39,417
and, possibly, the deaths
of 11,000 people.

760
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,709
No, he never
killed anyone.

761
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,166
The destruction of the planet
happened just as I told you.

762
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:48,125
PICARD:
But you haven't told us
the whole story--

763
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:52,583
how it ended,
the part about... Rishon.

764
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,458
What is he saying?

765
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:07,792
Rishon, I can touch you.

766
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:09,250
I can hear your voice.

767
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:10,625
I can smell your perfume.

768
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:13,250
In every respect,
you are a real person

769
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,792
with your own mind
and beliefs

770
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:21,125
but you do not exist.

771
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:24,750
You died, along with the others,
defending the colony.

772
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:30,000
He recreated you,
just as he recreated the house.

773
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,125
You're the only
living thing

774
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:39,417
that really exists on Rana

775
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:44,083
and though you look human,
you're not.

776
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:48,750
LA FORGE:
He's in turbolift.

777
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:49,917
Let him go.

778
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:51,709
WORF:
Captain, he is dangerous.

779
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,375
So dangerous, Mr. Worf,
that he could have

780
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,291
destroyed us
in an instant
had he wished.

781
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,458
Track him.

782
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,333
Alert the crew to
keep clear of him.

783
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,834
I want him to understand
we mean him no harm.

784
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,583
Will he return
to the planet?

785
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:05,542
If he is the creature
of conscience I
believe him to be

786
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:08,417
he has someone
to help first.

787
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:19,208
I've taken the music
from her mind.

788
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,959
She's all right now.

789
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,041
She's sleeping.

790
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:31,834
She was beginning
to sense who I really was.

791
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:34,667
I've lived as a human
for over 50 years

792
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:36,458
but I couldn't hide from her.

793
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,917
She has suffered because
of my pride and selfishness.

794
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:43,750
It will not happen again.

795
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:45,667
PICARD:
What happened on Rana IV?

796
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:48,291
The truth, this
time all of it.

797
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,875
Very well.

798
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,250
For what it's worth.

799
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:07,125
I am a Douwd

800
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:12,250
an immortal being of disguises
and false surroundings.

801
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:15,834
I have lived in this galaxy
for many thousands of years

802
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:20,583
although, until today, no one
has known my true identity.

803
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,709
Once, while traveling
in human form

804
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,709
I chanced to fall in love
with an Earth woman.

805
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,500
I put aside my powers
and became her husband.

806
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:34,166
Our life was
happy and rich.

807
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:37,041
Eventually, we came
to this planet

808
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:40,709
to live our final years.

809
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:45,250
Now she is dead.

810
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:48,625
She never knew
what I really was.

811
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:52,667
Your colony was attacked
by a warship...

812
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,500
Belonging
to the Husnock

813
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:57,792
a species
of hideous intelligence

814
00:40:57,834 --> 00:41:01,959
that knew only aggression
and destruction.

815
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,375
I could have destroyed them
with a mere thought

816
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:08,166
but I did not do so.

817
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:11,959
You had the power to stop them,
but you didn't?

818
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,834
I refused to for the same reason

819
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:19,000
that I refused to stop
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

820
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:23,208
I will not kill.

821
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,834
So you let the colonists
fight a hopeless battle.

822
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:31,458
I tried to fool the Husnock

823
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,917
as I tried to fool you

824
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:39,625
but it only made them angrier
and more cruel.

825
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:43,959
And then, what you
most feared happened.

826
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,375
Rishon went to fight
with the colonists

827
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,667
and died with them.

828
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:57,625
How I wish I could have died
with her.

829
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:59,250
But you couldn't.

830
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:03,625
You were left alone.

831
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,166
Yes.

832
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:11,291
I saw her broken body.

833
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:14,458
I went insane.

834
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,333
My hatred exploded

835
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:23,041
and in an instant of grief...

836
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,208
I destroyed the Husnock.

837
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:30,333
Why did you try to hide this
from all of us?

838
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,959
Was it out of guilt
for not helping Rishon

839
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,750
and the others
when they were alive?

840
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:36,667
No, no, no, no, no.

841
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:40,417
You don't understand
the scope of my crime.

842
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:46,834
I didn't kill just one Husnock,
or a hundred or a thousand...

843
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:49,583
I killed them all.

844
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,375
All Husnock...

845
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:57,500
everywhere.

846
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:09,083
Are 11,000 people
worth 50 billion?

847
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,166
Is the love of a woman

848
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:19,250
worth the destruction
of an entire species?

849
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:23,500
This is the sin I tried so hard
to keep you from learning--

850
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:28,417
why I wanted
to chase you from Rana.

851
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:32,250
We're not qualified
to be your judges.

852
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:36,583
We have no law
to fit your crime.

853
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,458
You're free to return
to the planet

854
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,458
and to make Rishon live again.

855
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,458
Helm, break orbit.

856
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,667
Full impulse.

857
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:11,583
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43153.7.</i>

858
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:15,667
<i>We are departing the Rana</i>
<i>system for Starbase 133.</i>

859
00:44:15,709 --> 00:44:17,583
<i>We leave behind a being</i>

860
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:20,667
<i>of extraordinary power</i>
<i>and conscience.</i>

861
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:25,000
<i>I'm not certain if he should</i>
<i>be praised or condemned</i>

862
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:29,041
<i>only that he should</i>
<i>be left alone.</i>
