00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:05,625
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate 41249.3.</i>

2
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:08,083
<i>We have orbited</i>
<i>the two major planets</i>

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,875
<i>of the Beta Renner system,</i>

4
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,291
<i>taking aboard delegates</i>
<i>from those two worlds.</i>

5
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,208
<i>Since achieving space flight</i>

6
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,000
<i>their major life-forms--</i>

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
<i>the Anticans and the Selay--</i>
<i>have become deadly enemies,</i>

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,875
<i>but both have also applied for</i>
<i>admission into our Federation.</i>

9
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,750
<i>We are to deliver</i>
<i>these delegates</i>

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,917
<i>to this sector's neutral</i>
<i>conference planet--</i>

11
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:28,417
<i>called Parliament--</i>

12
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:31,458
<i>in the hope their dispute</i>
<i>can be resolved.</i>

13
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,417
I'm Captain Picard.
Welcome aboard.

14
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:40,917
We hope your journey

15
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,625
will be pleasant
and comfortable.

16
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,792
Arranging that will be my
first officer, Commander Riker.

17
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:47,458
Welcome aboard.

18
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,875
If you'll follow me, I will
show you the accommodations...

19
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,959
We can already smell
the Anticans.

20
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:54,041
They were taken
aboard first?

21
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,625
Only because their world

22
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,417
was first on this heading
to Parliament.

23
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:01,375
Will our quarters
be near the Anticans?

24
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,333
About 100 meters apart.

25
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,250
Is that all right?

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,709
No.
Unsatisfactory.

27
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:10,375
I believe we can
accommodate your wishes.

28
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,417
We'll rearrange
the suite assignments.

29
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:13,709
If you'll follow me.

30
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,458
And we must be upwind
from the Anticans.

31
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,041
Of course, sir.

32
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:36,166
Neither seem like very promising
Federation candidates, sir.

33
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,667
Even Parliament's
peacemakers

34
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:40,083
may find this case
a little difficult.

35
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,834
But do you understand
the basis

36
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,417
of all this nonsense
between them?

37
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:56,000
No, sir. I never understood
that sort of hostility

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,333
even when I studied
Earth history.

39
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,834
Really? Oh, yes.

40
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:01,333
Well, these life-forms
feel such passionate hatred

41
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,250
over matters of custom,
god concepts...

42
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,709
even, strangely enough,
economic systems.

43
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,208
Sir, my sensors
are picking up

44
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,083
an unusual
energy object ahead.

45
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,750
On screen.

46
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:18,583
Confirmed, sir.

47
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,083
My sensors read nothing solid,
but considerable energy

48
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,375
in changing patterns.

49
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,709
Also traveling
at warp speed, sir.

50
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,375
Intriguing.

51
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,041
I can find no match with
anything in our records, sir.

52
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,917
Change course to make
a close sensor pass.

53
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:34,583
We can then increase
warp speed and reach

54
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,583
Parliament on schedule.
Aye, sir.

55
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:44,166
So, Worf, why
the interest in this?

56
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,959
It's just routine maintenance
on the sensor assemblies.

57
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,667
Simple, Geordi.

58
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,709
Our captain wants
his junior officers

59
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,917
to learn, learn, learn.

60
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,875
Not just his junior ones.

61
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,083
Okay, you hold
this relay off-line

62
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,625
while I adjust
these sensor circuits.

63
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,333
Security to
Sensor Maintenance.

64
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,083
Lieutenant
La Forge here.

65
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,750
We're making a close sensor pass
on an unusual object, Geordi.

66
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,333
Any problems?

67
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,834
Not at all, Lieutenant.

68
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:10,834
All equipment on-line
and functioning.

69
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,000
Sensors ready, sir.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,750
Life-form reading?

71
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,542
No life-form reading, sir.

72
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,208
Begin the pass.

73
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:23,709
Sir, it is changing shape.

74
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,166
Any readings of matter there?

75
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,542
Negative, sir.

76
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,709
Energy only.

77
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,333
(<i> screaming</i> )

78
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,750
Worf!

79
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,417
La Forge to Sick Bay.

80
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,417
We have a medical emergency
in Sensor Maintenance.

81
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,375
I repeat, this is
a medical emergency.

82
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:36,458
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

83
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:41,458
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

84
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,667
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

85
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,667
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

86
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:51,667
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

87
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:56,333
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

88
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,834
What happened?
I don't know.

89
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,417
He got hit by some sensor
feedback, maybe.

90
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,583
(<i> shouts</i> )

91
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,083
You got it, Doc?

92
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,375
I got it.

93
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,000
Lieutenant Worf, can you
hear what I'm saying?

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,917
(<i> grunts</i> )

95
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,875
Let's get him up.
Okay.

96
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,250
Come on, big guy.
On your feet.

97
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,291
Here we go.

98
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,333
That's it.

99
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,750
Are you okay?

100
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,875
He was just monitoring
the sensor console

101
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,625
when he jerked as though
something hit him.

102
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,625
What my sensors showed was...

103
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,917
it was a glow...

104
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,333
just for a second.

105
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,166
I can't explain it.

106
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,834
Could your visor device
have malfunctioned?

107
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,667
I doubt it, sir.

108
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,000
It seemed like what I was seeing
was something real.

109
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,375
(<i> growls</i> )

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,959
Sorry to call you, sir.

111
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,959
Not strictly security.

112
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,500
It's about the
dietary requirements

113
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
of the Antican delegates.

114
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,250
I thought that had been
taken care of in advance, Tasha.

115
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,500
So did we, sir.

116
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,458
Their live animals
were beamed aboard.

117
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,959
We were going to preserve
the meat for them...

118
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,792
but they say we must
bring it to them alive.

119
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,500
Then do so.

120
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,375
Lieutenant Yar was...
confused.

121
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,208
We no longer enslave animals
for food purposes.

122
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:44,000
But we have seen
humans eat meat.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,208
You've seen something
as fresh and tasty as meat,

124
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,291
but inorganically materialized

125
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,166
out of patterns
used by our transporters.

126
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,125
Sickening!

127
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,959
It's barbaric!

128
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,750
He's reading normal now.

129
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,041
How did you manage that?

130
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,125
Yes. Normal.

131
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,542
Are you all right?

132
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,542
Yes. Perfectly.

133
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,458
Both of us...
quite normal now.

134
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:45,625
Where-- where am I?

135
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,083
Don't you remember?

136
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,417
You were in the
sensor maintenance room.

137
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:53,750
I remember monitoring
the sensor console.

138
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,125
What am I doing here?

139
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,792
That's a story
the doctor will tell you.

140
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,834
Obviously, you seem to feel
it's something

141
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,625
we should look at
more carefully.

142
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,083
A mystery is
only a mystery

143
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,917
as long as it remains
un-investigated, sir.

144
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:18,166
Mm, I love a mystery, Data,

145
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,625
but this one
will have to wait

146
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,291
until we've delivered
the delegates

147
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,083
to their peace conference
on Parliament.

148
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,333
Time and tide,
Lieutenant La Forge.

149
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,208
Go to warp 8.

150
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,625
Warp 8, sir.

151
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,291
Hi, Mom.

152
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,291
You're back early.

153
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,458
Yes.

154
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,625
Physical sciences class.

155
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,166
We're studying Dr. Channing's
theory on dilithium crystals.

156
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,500
Tell me about it.

157
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,000
Really?

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,875
You never seemed that interested
in warp theory before.

159
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:06,792
Doctor Channing thinks it's
possible to force dilithium

160
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,709
into even more useful crystals.

161
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,250
If, as shown here,

162
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,583
matter and antimatter
could be aligned

163
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,834
even more efficiently...

164
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,166
Would that affect navigation?

165
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,375
This is engineering,
not helm control.

166
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,667
Oh, yes,

167
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:23,667
the helm's located
on the bridge.

168
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,709
Mom?

169
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,625
Is something wrong?

170
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,000
This is the helm.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,750
Unless there have been
some changes I don't know about.

172
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,750
Dr. Crusher?

173
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:56,542
You will
wish to know

174
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,125
Lieutenant Worf
is much improved.

175
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,542
Ready to return to duty.

176
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,083
What was the diagnosis?

177
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,125
A temporary
mental aberration.

178
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,125
Doctor!

179
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,834
When such a diagnosis
concerns a bridge officer

180
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:14,959
I expect a better
explanation.

181
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,792
Then I will have to first
run some cross-checks

182
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,291
on the library computer.

183
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,917
Klingons are so unusual
in their reactions,

184
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:23,959
aren't they?

185
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,792
Use Science
Station 2, Doctor.

186
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,792
Intriguing, Doctor.

187
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:47,875
What does helm control have
to do with medical cross-checks?

188
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,250
Why am I...

189
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,834
Is something wrong, Doctor?

190
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:11,417
Doctor?
Are you all right?

191
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:14,291
Yes.

192
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,834
Yes.

193
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:21,250
I'll do my work
in my office.

194
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,375
That's where
I should be.

195
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,458
Do you want someone
to accompany you?

196
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:33,125
Captain, there is
a malfunction in this station.

197
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,458
I cannot bring
any information up on it.

198
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,333
Science 2 does not
function either, sir.

199
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,750
Engineering to Captain Picard.

200
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,333
We have something wrong with
warp drive circuitry, sir.

201
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,000
Transporter Room 6 to Bridge.

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,583
Reporting transporter
console malfunction, sir.

203
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,083
Data, this ship is less than
a year out of spacedock.

204
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,917
What are the chances
of this occurring?

205
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:10,291
It is a virtual
impossibility, sir.

206
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,792
So what the hell
is going on here?

207
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,458
And you're telling me
that there are no explanations

208
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,709
for these malfunctions?

209
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,375
At least, sir,
all the department heads

210
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,250
reported the
damage repaired.

211
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,166
That was not my question,
Number One.

212
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,333
What caused
the malfunctions?

213
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,458
I believe it was a
rampant electronic short

214
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,000
that jumped from system
to system, sir.

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,667
But the only thing is, um...

216
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,542
Yes, Mr. Singh?

217
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,166
That shouldn't be possible.

218
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,834
The affected systems
don't generally interact
with each other.

219
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,792
And where
they do, well...

220
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,625
it wasn't an interlink
that was malfunctioning.

221
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,458
Have you spoken
with Chief Engineer Argyle

222
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,750
about this problem?

223
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,333
With all the engineering
staff, sir.

224
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,834
They're just as puzzled.

225
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,083
Well, I'm not satisfied.

226
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,667
I want an explanation
of this

227
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,458
by the time
we reach Parliament.

228
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,125
But, sir...

229
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,792
By the time we reach
Parliament, Mr. Singh.

230
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,458
These weapons were taken
from two of your people

231
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,250
who were loitering
out of sight

232
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,458
in the vicinity of the Selay
delegation's quarters.

233
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,750
Do you care
to explain, sir?

234
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,125
These are not weapons,
First Officer.

235
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,667
They are tools.

236
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:49,667
We use these to dispatch
the animals we consume.

237
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,417
Your food supply is not
on the same deck

238
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:52,917
as the Selay
delegation, sir.

239
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:55,250
And you have to admit
that these could kill.

240
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,041
I admit some of my people
are impulsive

241
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,792
and we all have reason
to hate the Selay.

242
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:05,291
They appear to have the same
feelings about you, sir.

243
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,583
Ah, the nature
of politics.

244
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,417
Nevertheless,
Chief Delegate,

245
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:11,166
you are on notice
that all of your weapons,

246
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,000
no matter what their
basic function,

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,125
are being confiscated.

248
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,041
Violence will not be
tolerated on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

249
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,542
Of course not.

250
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:25,083
And if any does occur,
let me assure you

251
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,208
it will not be
we Anticans who start it.

252
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,875
Thank you, sir.

253
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,458
But...

254
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,166
we will finish it.

255
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,041
Sir, warp power is fading.

256
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,875
Picard to Engineering.

257
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:49,125
What is the problem?

258
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,375
We've lost the warp engine
computer tie.

259
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,500
Warp five... four...

260
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,750
three... two...

261
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,959
State-of-the-art vessel?

262
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,458
Data, signal Parliament
we'll be delayed.

263
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,458
We will send
a new arrival time

264
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,875
as soon as it is determined.

265
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,458
Sir...

266
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,667
subspace radio is out.

267
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,417
All right, gentlemen.

268
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:31,208
Your theories on this sudden
vulnerability in our systems.

269
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,333
If the<i> Enterprise</i> were
really this fragile, sir,

270
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,542
she never would
have left spacedock.

271
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:39,583
Therefore, her systems' failures
are not endemic to the ship

272
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,500
but are the result of the
actions of an unknown adversary.

273
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,917
We have a saboteur aboard.

274
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,917
I believe I said that.

275
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:50,208
Gentlemen,
the question is who?

276
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,750
I can't believe it's
one of our own people.

277
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,000
Agreed. There must be someone
from either alien delegation.

278
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,417
If the Ferengi could have bought
or bribed even one of them

279
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:00,667
that's all they'd need.

280
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,709
Ferengi contacts
have been detected

281
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:05,000
on both Selay
and Antica, sir.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,667
Can either of you suggest
any other suspects?

283
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,333
You're sounding like
a private eye, sir.

284
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,417
Inquiry: private eye?

285
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:17,583
A private consulting
investigator, Data--

286
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,041
who solves crimes.

287
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,375
Hmm.
Most interesting occupation.

288
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,875
In the world of fact,
probably not.

289
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,959
However in literature,
criminal detection

290
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:32,583
can be a fascinating exercise.

291
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,959
The immortal Sherlock Holmes
would have an interesting

292
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:36,500
view of our mystery,
I believe.

293
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,083
But I'm afraid we're going
to have to find

294
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,208
our solution without history's

295
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,375
greatest
consulting detective.

296
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,709
How about here,
Mr. Singh?

297
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,875
If the control network
breaks off at this point...

298
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,750
It bleeds warp engine
commands off into dead ends.

299
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,750
Excellent.

300
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:12,375
Well, I believe I can handle
it from here, Mr. Crusher.

301
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,125
But, sir...

302
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,542
You are scheduled
for classwork now. Sorry.

303
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,542
Yes, sir.

304
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:27,250
But I don't learn nearly
this much in school.

305
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,959
Well, I tend to agree.

306
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,417
But the captain's orders
on this are very clear.

307
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:45,875
Hi.

308
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:51,375
Solve any new
problems today?

309
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,458
I was starting to,
maybe.

310
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,291
Mr. Singh sent me
off to class.

311
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,583
Wes, you're only
an acting ensign.

312
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,083
You've got to let the
commissioned officers

313
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,125
do some of the work.

314
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:08,208
Mom, I've learned a lot
more than they understand.

315
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,125
For example--
with Channing's

316
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,834
dilithium crystals theory
I was telling you about...

317
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,875
When were you telling me
about that?

318
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,959
This morning.
Don't you remember?

319
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,542
Honestly,
I don't remember.

320
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,834
Engineering to Captain Picard.
Security alert.

321
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,250
Picard.
Lieutenant Worf, sir.

322
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,125
I just found Mr. Singh.

323
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,834
He's dead.

324
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:18,542
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate 41249.4.</i>

325
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:21,542
<i>I've ordered</i>
<i>an immediate investigation</i>

326
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:24,291
<i>into the death of</i>
<i>Assistant Chief Engineer Singh.</i>

327
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,792
<i>We continue to run</i>
<i>on impulse power.</i>

328
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,750
He could have been
working there

329
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,458
restoring warp power.

330
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,250
Well, according to
these readings

331
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,375
we can go back
to warp speed now.

332
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,291
Those aren't the same
readings as when I left.

333
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,917
Singh probably repaired it
just before he was killed.

334
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:45,208
He couldn't have
repaired it, sir.

335
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,917
The problems were
inside the engines.

336
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:50,667
Who else could have
corrected it, Wes?

337
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,625
Inform the bridge
of engine status.

338
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,709
Engineering to Bridge.

339
00:20:56,709 --> 00:20:59,500
We now have warp capacity, sir--
all power on-line.

340
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,834
Well done. Warp engines ready
on previous heading.

341
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,959
Warp factor 6.

342
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:13,583
I tolerate these questions,
Lieutenant Yar,

343
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,834
because I need this vessel
to get us to Parliament.

344
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:19,959
Your shipboard problems
do not concern me.

345
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,750
They should.
Our delays are your delays.

346
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,750
(<i> growls</i> )

347
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,041
The peace conference
will wait for us.

348
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,834
I must ask where you were

349
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:31,667
during this vessel's
Earth hours of 1800 last night

350
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,959
and 0700 this morning?

351
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,166
Eating.

352
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,417
Sir, we're talking
about hours here.

353
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:41,375
(<i> laughing</i> )

354
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:49,458
It was a large meal,
Lieutenant Yar,

355
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,834
and a very interesting animal.

356
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,000
You wanted me, Doctor?

357
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,917
Yes, concerning
your memory blackout.

358
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:08,333
I still don't remember
having one.

359
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,208
The same thing happened to me.

360
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,291
I want to try hypnosis
on both of you.

361
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,959
It may restore your memory
as to what happened.

362
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:21,750
One thing is clear-- almost
all of the peace delegates

363
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,750
answered our questions
with lies.

364
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,083
Imprecise, Lieutenant.

365
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,291
They omitted certain truths

366
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:31,041
which in itself
tells us something.

367
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:34,208
We can learn something
from nondisclosure?

368
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,417
Indubitably, my good woman.

369
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,917
It's something
the captain mentioned.

370
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,458
Sherlock Holmes.

371
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,417
Indubitably...

372
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:49,250
Data has been
studying him.

373
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,625
Has studied, sir, every case.

374
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,750
As Holmes would have
pointed out,

375
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,583
during the time in question,
something was afoot.

376
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,250
Afoot?

377
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,625
While both sets of delegates

378
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,250
say they were
in their quarters,

379
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,041
our crew locator sensed them
passing here and here.

380
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,959
But since it doesn't show
where they went,

381
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,208
we're still in the dark.

382
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:18,125
On the contrary,
my dear colleague.

383
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,834
On their return,
they drew medical supplies

384
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:27,417
appropriate to the treatment
of minor wounds and abrasions

385
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:28,750
on these
life-forms.

386
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,417
Which leaves us
with only one conclusion.

387
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:31,834
Exactly.

388
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:33,542
That they were too engaged
in their own affairs

389
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,750
to have disabled the ship
and murdered the engineer.

390
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,083
Given the choice, they would
rather kill each other

391
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,083
than any of us.

392
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,333
It's elementary,

393
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,959
my dear Riker.

394
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,375
Sir.

395
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:54,083
Beverly, can you hear me?

396
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,041
Yes.

397
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,542
I want you to go back
in your mind

398
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,709
to the moment
when you first recall

399
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:08,542
this sensation
of memory loss.

400
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:11,959
Picture it exactly
as it occurred.

401
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:17,083
He's lying on
the hospital bed, sedated.

402
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:20,208
I'm walking up to him...

403
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,041
I...

404
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,667
How do you feel at this moment

405
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:29,291
as you lean over him
to take the specimen?

406
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:32,291
I feel...

407
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,875
someone else...

408
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:38,166
There's someone else
who's there.

409
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:41,041
Not a... not alone.

410
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,792
Get out.
Get out of my mind.

411
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:58,417
That's almost
exactly what you said.

412
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:00,792
As though there were
something else inside you.

413
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:06,375
Which confirms the feeling
of duality that I sensed

414
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,709
earlier in both of them.

415
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,417
Why didn't you report it?

416
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:12,959
Because, sir,
I assumed at first

417
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:16,542
it was the kind of duality that
we Betazeds feel in all of you.

418
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:19,041
Even you, sir.

419
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,500
When you approach
a decision

420
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,500
and ask yourself
which direction to go,

421
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,291
who are you
talking to?

422
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,083
Hmm.

423
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:32,041
Your hypnotism revealed
another form of duality?

424
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,917
Yes, sir.

425
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:36,250
I believe something
invaded them.

426
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,709
It's the only
possible conclusion.

427
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,291
Data...

428
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,834
Let's proceed
without the pipe.

429
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,458
Yes, sir, if you wish, sir.

430
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,458
But I ask if you take it
as incontrovertible

431
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:57,208
that it cannot be
a family member

432
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,000
or one of the crew?

433
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,834
Yes, very unlikely.

434
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,417
Then our investigation
was worthwhile, sir.

435
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:06,291
We've eliminated
both the delegates

436
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,542
and the ship's
regular complement.

437
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,542
Data, what are you suggesting?

438
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:17,458
I am referring to the great
detective's credo, sir.

439
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,834
I quote--

440
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:22,250
"We must fall back
on the old axiom

441
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,375
"that when other
contingencies fail,

442
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:29,458
"whatever remains
however improbable

443
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:33,291
must be the truth."

444
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,750
(<i> water gurgles</i> )

445
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:46,125
That engine computer net
wasn't repaired, sir.

446
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:49,166
It just suddenly
became all right.

447
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:51,875
Sometimes, it's the result
that counts, you know?

448
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,542
What the... oh, no.

449
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,333
What is it?

450
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,834
Helm control just went down.
She won't respond.

451
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:03,667
Bridge to Captain.
You're needed here immediately.

452
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:06,917
Wes, alert engineering from
your panel, all right?

453
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,083
I'm trying.

454
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,917
Report.

455
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:12,792
Helm is down, sir.

456
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,667
There's no apparent reason.

457
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,083
Captain, we've just dropped
to impulse power.

458
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,792
Sir, are you all right?

459
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:33,917
I thought I just saw...

460
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:36,625
I'm fine.

461
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,166
Everything is fine now.

462
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:58,000
Why the drop to impulse power,
Lieutenant?

463
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The helm is suddenly
malfunctioning, sir.

464
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,917
Malfunctioning?

465
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,709
You're wrong. Look again.

466
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:05,333
Captain, I was just...

467
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,458
Mr. La Forge?

468
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,959
Well, there's nothing
wrong with it now, sir.

469
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:14,417
Everything is
just as it should be.

470
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:17,959
In that case,
make our heading

471
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:22,291
925 mark 3... 7.

472
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,875
Sir?

473
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:28,000
You have a problem
with that heading, Lieutenant?

474
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,792
You want to double back
on our course, sir?

475
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,959
Isn't that what I ordered?

476
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:40,125
GEORDI:
Yes, sir.

477
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:55,834
Sir... I'm puzzled by
your reversing our course.

478
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,375
That energy cloud, Commander.

479
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:02,083
I believe it important
we have another look at it.

480
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,625
But we're behind schedule
for Parliament already.

481
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,875
I believe a very important
scientific discovery

482
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,667
awaits us on this heading.

483
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:12,917
Perhaps you'd like to share
your reasoning on that, sir?

484
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,000
Yes, since we obtained
only minimal information

485
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,750
on our sensor pass of it.

486
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,417
Right, Data.

487
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:21,959
We must go back to learn more.

488
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:24,959
Counselor...

489
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:27,291
do you believe
a ship captain

490
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:29,709
should explain<i> every</i> order?

491
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:33,834
Of course not, sir.

492
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:43,250
I demand to see
the captain!

493
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,041
Stop! Return
to your quarters!

494
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,417
(<i> shriek of disgust</i> )

495
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:49,917
What is that doing
on our deck?

496
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:53,875
I demand to know why this
starship has changed its course!

497
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,834
Please return
to your quarters, delegates.

498
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:59,291
(<i> hostile growls</i> )

499
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:03,333
A mere change of direction
hardly justifies mutiny.

500
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:07,083
Exactly what do you believe
you're sensing from him?

501
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:09,291
It's just the
feeling that...

502
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:13,208
well, that he's closed
part of his mind to me.

503
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:15,375
I just feel

504
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:18,000
that the captain
has become...

505
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,375
perhaps dangerous.

506
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,959
If he's dangerous...

507
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,458
<i>if...</i>

508
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,083
Then he'd have to be
relieved of command.

509
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:31,959
Which you could do, Doctor.

510
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:34,041
It's<i> beaucoup</i> trouble
if you're wrong.

511
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:37,125
And at the moment,
it is all pure speculation.

512
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:40,500
He's done nothing to subject
the<i> Enterprise</i> to danger.

513
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,542
I'd need a medical log citing
clear evidence of incapacity.

514
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,750
You could do it
without that problem.

515
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,875
Only if all command officers
agreed it was vital to do so.

516
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:56,083
But he has not been showing
any overt unusual behavior.

517
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:59,750
Ultimately,
I believe he will.

518
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:05,917
As second in command,
it's still in your corner.

519
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:08,583
I'll order medical
and psychiatric exams.

520
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,917
You'll have to back
me up somehow.

521
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,959
<i>First officer's log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

522
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:26,709
<i>After meeting</i>
<i>with the senior officers,</i>

523
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:29,125
<i>Dr. Crusher and I have decided</i>
<i>to approach the captain</i>

524
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,250
<i>regarding his recent behavior.</i>

525
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,333
(<i> door shuts</i> )

526
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,709
Yes?

527
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:42,125
I'd like you to come
to Sick Bay

528
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:44,333
for some examinations,
Captain.

529
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:45,917
Oh?

530
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:48,625
I'd be glad to,
when I'm free.

531
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:52,458
I'd like to conduct
them now, sir.

532
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,417
Why?

533
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:01,458
What can I do for you,
Number One?

534
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:04,667
Sir, counselor Troi has
recommended the examinations.

535
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,500
Same question-- why?

536
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:12,542
It is my duty to
inform the captain

537
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:15,375
we believe he may be under
some kind of alien influence

538
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:19,125
which may constitute
a danger to this ship.

539
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:26,208
I consider it
equally possible

540
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:28,125
that the two of you,

541
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,166
and counselor Troi,

542
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,333
are overworked

543
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,667
and possibly suffering
hallucinations.

544
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,291
Now, this is an order--

545
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:39,041
you will arrange medical
and psychiatric exams

546
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,333
both for yourself
and them.

547
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:46,875
Doctor, are you aware everyone
is behaving strangely?

548
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,291
I'm concerned that
you've suddenly turned

549
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:50,667
the ship away
from its course...

550
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,792
What's happened
to your mind, Doctor?

551
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,166
The search for knowledge is
always our primary mission.

552
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:06,375
I'm sorry. I...

553
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:09,959
I really am too busy
for this kind of nonsense.

554
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,583
Do I have to call security

555
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:16,250
to force you to report
to the Sick Bay?

556
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,917
No, sir.

557
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,041
What the hell?!

558
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,291
Sorry, wrong species.

559
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:47,917
Riker to security chief!

560
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,208
Yar here.

561
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,458
Security guard
to the engineering deck.

562
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:54,709
The Selays are playing
hide-and-seek down here,
obviously with the Anticans.

563
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:56,208
It's a lethal game.

564
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,250
I want them returned
to quarters, under guard!

565
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,625
Right away, sir.

566
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,208
(<i> chime sounds</i> )

567
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,208
Come.

568
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,709
What do you want?

569
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:17,291
Here are the results from the
exams you ordered, sir.

570
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:29,709
You don't care
to inspect them?

571
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,542
Please...

572
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:36,458
are you Jean-Luc?

573
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,792
He is here.

574
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:40,875
The Jean-Luc I know?

575
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,959
And more.

576
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:46,000
The more frightens me.

577
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,792
And elates us.

578
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:51,458
We wish you could understand
the glorious adventure ahead.

579
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:54,250
You and...

580
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:58,417
Soon we'll both be home.

581
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:09,166
<i>First officer's log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

582
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,166
<i>On the orders</i>
<i>of Captain Picard,</i>

583
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,875
<i>we have returned</i>
<i>to the vicinity</i>

584
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,583
<i>of the energy pattern cloud.</i>

585
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,375
<i>I am personally convinced</i>

586
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,542
<i>that something from this cloud</i>

587
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:20,667
<i>now shares the captain's mind.</i>

588
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,959
<i>But there seems to be</i>
<i>nothing we can do--</i>

589
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:24,792
<i>at least within regulations.</i>

590
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:27,041
We're now approaching
the cloud, sir.

591
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:30,125
Very well, Mr. La Forge.

592
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,750
Bring us to within 10,000
kilometers and hold us there.

593
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,500
Aye, sir.

594
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:44,709
Shall we begin the scientific
tests you wanted, sir?

595
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,917
Oh, they're already underway.

596
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:57,625
I have an announcement
for the entire bridge.

597
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,000
As many of you suspected,

598
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,750
when our ship passed
through the edge of this,

599
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,000
it accidentally carried away

600
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,667
a sentient being--

601
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,417
much like these
energy patterns

602
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:14,625
we're seeing here.

603
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:17,625
A terrifying experience
for any intelligent being--

604
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:21,291
as if a great claw reached
down and scooped one of you

605
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,125
from your home world.

606
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,583
Drawn in to the energy
circuits of this vessel.

607
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,375
It found its way
to you, Worf.

608
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,709
Frantic at being taken
from its home world

609
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,709
and recognizing you
as sentient beings,

610
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:32,959
it pleaded for help,

611
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:36,500
but in ways
you couldn't understand.

612
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,417
Desperately going
from person to person.

613
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:43,250
And then discovering
the computer intelligence

614
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,166
in this ship's
memory circuits.

615
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:47,959
Oh, simplistic intelligence--

616
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:50,834
but it furnished it enough

617
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:55,417
to slow this<i> Enterprise</i> thing

618
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:57,500
that had captured it.

619
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,208
And it very much regrets

620
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:03,458
the accidental death
of engineer Singh.

621
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,125
Captain...

622
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:10,041
do you exist
in combination

623
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,917
with this entity?

624
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,875
Is it in control
of you, sir?

625
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:15,583
Very soon after
we had combined

626
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:17,583
we had learned much
about each other.

627
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,834
Passion for exploration,
for the unknown--

628
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:21,583
we found we had
similar dreams.

629
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,375
And it offered your
captain a way

630
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,083
to realize them

631
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,542
beyond human
expectations.

632
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:27,750
RIKER:
Captain!

633
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,500
I must speak to you
privately, now!

634
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,792
I understand.

635
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,542
As an energy pattern,

636
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,542
free of the limitations
of matter,

637
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:39,000
he might travel anywhere.

638
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,583
At any velocity.

639
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,750
Captain, do you hear me?

640
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:47,041
Sir, I see no way for you to
journey with an energy form.

641
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,917
Isn't there?

642
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,750
He's planning to beam himself

643
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,917
and the entity
into that cloud.

644
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,333
The transporter need not pattern
your captain into matter.

645
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,333
We'll beam energy only

646
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:06,583
and we will become
a combined energy pattern

647
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:09,333
of our life-forms.

648
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,417
A resignation from this command
and from Starfleet has been

649
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:13,500
appropriately
recorded.

650
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,000
I refuse to allow this, sir.

651
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,208
How does this resignation
threaten the ship

652
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,583
or its crew in any way?

653
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,417
Captain Picard, you are
now relieved of duty.

654
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:23,250
I judge you
to be disabled

655
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,417
and mentally
incapacitated.

656
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:29,208
RIKER:
Security!

657
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,291
Red alert!

658
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:32,709
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

659
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:34,500
Restrain the captain!

660
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,375
Where is he?

661
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,625
This is
blinding me!

662
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,792
WORF:
Captain!

663
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:47,208
I'll help you
if you let me!

664
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,083
Someone restrain the captain!

665
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:59,000
(<i> alarm continuing</i> )

666
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:25,500
RIKER:
<i>First officer's log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

667
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,417
<i>More than an hour has passed</i>

668
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:29,625
<i>since the captain beamed out,</i>
<i>energy only.</i>

669
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:33,583
<i>Every effort has been made</i>
<i>to determine his whereabouts.</i>

670
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,000
The transporter
chief has no idea

671
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,625
what the coordinates
were, sir.

672
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,583
So he's just floating
around out there?

673
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,041
How can we
settle for that?

674
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:42,291
Give me a choice, then.

675
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:45,208
Still no readings,
no sign of anything.

676
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,625
Mr. La Forge...

677
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:03,500
it's time to set a course
for Parliament.

678
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,333
Warp 8.

679
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:08,792
We're really leaving him?

680
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:12,041
Commander... wait!

681
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,583
It's the captain.

682
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,667
But only the captain.

683
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,875
He's out there alone.

684
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,959
The entity,
has it abandoned him?

685
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:25,750
No.

686
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,667
But the combination wasn't
possible out there.

687
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:33,041
He's in trouble,
so we have to beam him back.

688
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:35,834
Beam him back as what?
He's nothing but energy now.

689
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:39,125
Sir, the entity was caught
in the ship's circuitry.

690
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,583
The captain might try

691
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,792
to get in the same way
if he's in trouble.

692
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,333
Bring us in closer, La Forge.

693
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:47,083
Moving in, sir, but where?

694
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,500
There's no way to know.

695
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,291
Let's hope he can come
part way himself.

696
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,959
Troi, is there any way
you can get a message to him?

697
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:05,583
I wish I could.

698
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:08,458
Sensors monitoring
the perimeter...

699
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:13,208
ship's circuitry, sir--
nothing.

700
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,709
Bring us right into the edge
of it, La Forge.

701
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:16,875
Aye, sir.

702
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,500
Sir!

703
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,000
On my sensor controls.

704
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,750
There's something here.

705
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,542
I feel it.

706
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:34,500
Just as before,
going to Worf first.

707
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,750
Something crazy on my panel.

708
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,959
Commander Riker...

709
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,750
GEORDI:
Static?

710
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,750
"P" for Picard?

711
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,250
He's in the ship's
circuitry.

712
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,917
Come to the transporter
room, please.

713
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:55,625
There might be
a way, sir. Hurry!

714
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,709
This is a wild theory, Data.

715
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:10,083
I knew we had to have
the captain's physical
pattern here, sir.

716
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,000
He was the last one
to beam out.

717
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,792
Is what you're
thinking possible?

718
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,458
Unknown at this time, sir.

719
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:17,917
I hope the captain remembers
his physical pattern is here.

720
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:19,792
If he has,
his energy has moved

721
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:21,875
into the transporter
relays by now.

722
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:25,333
I wish we had some sign
that he was in here.

723
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:28,208
I guess we have no choice
but to risk it.

724
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:29,667
Energizing, sir.

725
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,542
What the devil am I doing here?

726
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:04,208
Sounds like our captain.

727
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,834
But confused.

728
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,834
This Picard pattern was formed

729
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:09,417
before he went
out there.

730
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:16,000
What's happening to me,
Number One?

731
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,125
I was preparing to...

732
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:20,208
to beam out...

733
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,625
to somewhere.

734
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:25,250
And I remember there
was talk of an entity.

735
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,959
But it all seems so vague.

736
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:30,750
I believe the captain is now
his separate self, sir.

737
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,125
Much of what happened
is naturally missing.

738
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:35,083
What are you talking
about, Data?

739
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,875
Is this still
Sherlock Holmes?

740
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:39,417
Indubitably, sir.

741
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,583
Indubitably.

742
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:45,083
Hmm. At least you got rid
of that damned pipe.

743
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:48,208
Dr. Crusher has asked me
to steer you past Sick Bay.

744
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,917
She said you've been
looking very tired.

745
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:52,917
Captain!
Yes, Lieutenant.

746
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:56,458
Sorry, Commander,
but Security Team Two reports

747
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,959
they've discovered a puddle of
blood outside the Selay quarters

748
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:01,291
and they can't find
one of the delegates...

749
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:03,917
Lieutenant, this couldn't
have waited a moment?

750
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:05,834
It's good to see you, sir.

751
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:09,583
The problem is is that one of
the cooks has just been asked

752
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,500
to broil reptile
for the Anticans

753
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,000
and it looks like
the Selay delegate.

754
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:20,500
Riker, what with the
peace delegates and all,

755
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,959
I think I do
need a rest.

756
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:25,166
Take charge,
Number One.
