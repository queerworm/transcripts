1
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:05,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45761.3.</i>

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:08,458
<i>In an effort to bring an end</i>
<i>to their centuries-long war,</i>

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
<i>Krios and Valt Minor</i>
<i>have agreed</i>

4
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:12,250
<i>to a ceremony</i>
<i>of reconciliation</i>

5
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:13,959
<i>to be held</i>
<i>aboard the</i> Enterprise

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,834
<i>at a point midway</i>
<i>between their two systems.</i>

7
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,125
I apologize for the delay

8
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,458
in our arrival,
Ambassador Briam.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,250
We had to stop
at Harod IV

10
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,083
to pick up a group
of stranded miners.

11
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,542
Please, Captain.
We are grateful

12
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,583
that the Federation has
taken as much interest

13
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,208
as it has
in this matter.

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,834
Was Commander La Forge
able to provide you

15
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,375
with the special cargo handling
provisions you requested?

16
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:33,625
Indeed, he was.

17
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:37,125
However, until we
reach the rendezvous

18
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,750
with the Valtese, may
I ask that the cargo bay

19
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:41,375
be declared
off-limits to all

20
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,875
but the most
essential personnel?

21
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:45,083
I trust, Ambassador,

22
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,834
that this cargo
is in no way dangerous.

23
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,083
Oh, no. Nothing
of the sort.

24
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,542
I'm cautious
because it's quite

25
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,959
fragile-- and quite
irreplaceable.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,583
RIKER:
Bridge to Captain Picard.

27
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,000
Go ahead.

28
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,583
Captain, we've just picked up
a distress call

29
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,417
from a Ferengi shuttle.

30
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,166
Set a course to intercept.
Aye, sir.

31
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,458
Captain, the timing
of our ceremony

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,375
with Alrik is critical.
It cannot be delayed.

33
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:09,750
We'll be at the rendezvous
on schedule, don't worry.

34
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:11,125
Excuse me.

35
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:16,000
The Ferengi report

36
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,417
their containment field
is collapsing.

37
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,000
WORF:
Within visual range, Captain.

38
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,125
On screen.

39
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,291
Their reactor core
is unstable, Captain.

40
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,458
How many onboard?

41
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,834
DATA:
Two, sir.

42
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,625
Bridge to transporter
room three.

43
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,000
Boost your output.
Lock onto

44
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,417
the two Ferengi
onboard the shuttle.

45
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,917
We may need to attempt
a long-range transport.

46
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,542
Standing by.

47
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,542
Energize.

48
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,250
Got them, sir.

49
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:57,834
Mr. Worf, escort our
Ferengi guests to quarters.

50
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,333
Not too close to mine.

51
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,291
Understood.

52
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,542
Unless you can arrange
your own transport,

53
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,417
you will have to remain
on the<i> Enterprise</i>

54
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,083
until we complete
our mission.

55
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,458
That will not be
a problem.

56
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,583
We are in no hurry.

57
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,333
We look forward
to enjoying

58
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,667
the comforts
of your fine ship.

59
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,709
Hmm... quite
acceptable.

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,959
It's not what
we're used to,

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,500
you understand,
but it will do.

62
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:37,083
Perhaps your captain
would care to invite us

63
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,458
to join him for dinner
this evening.

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,583
The captain dines alone.

65
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,417
A pity.

66
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,792
That was too easy.

67
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:54,917
(<i> both cackling</i> )

68
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:26,375
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

69
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:30,709
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

70
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,375
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

71
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:36,000
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

72
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:40,542
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

73
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,542
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,208
We've been working
from your drawings, Ambassador.

75
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,291
I hope we're
in the ballpark.

76
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,875
"Ballpark"?

77
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,583
That's an old
human expression.

78
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,000
Mr. La Forge hopes
that we got close

79
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,125
to achieving
what you want.

80
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:06,750
Computer, run holodeck
program Krios One.

81
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:08,959
COMPUTER:
Enter when ready.

82
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:17,750
Astonishing.

83
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:20,417
It is the ancient temple
of Akadar.

84
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:28,083
It is this temple that bonds
Krios and Valt, gentlemen.

85
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:32,875
Two brothers ruled a vast empire
from this site,

86
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,250
until they were torn apart

87
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,750
by their love
for an extraordinary woman.

88
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:40,125
This is where
the wars began...

89
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:44,875
and this is where
they shall end.

90
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,750
There are some details
to be added, of course.

91
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:12,083
Commander La Forge
will be entirely

92
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,375
at your disposal,
Ambassador.

93
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:14,709
Just let me know
what you need.

94
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,917
Yes, of course.

95
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,250
I must consult
several of

96
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,750
the historical volumes
I've brought with me,

97
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,542
so perhaps we can
reconvene later.

98
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,000
Excuse me!

99
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,625
Excuse me.

100
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,959
Is it true?

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,417
Is a Kriosian ambassador
aboard this vessel?

102
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.
Can I help you?

103
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,291
The ambassador's
very busy.

104
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,792
Ah. Do you schedule
his appointments?

105
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:35,041
I'm the captain
of this ship.

106
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,375
What is it
you want?

107
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,083
Allow me
to present myself.

108
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,792
Par Lenor, of the Ferengi
Trade Mission.

109
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,917
We are pleased
to hear, Ambassador,

110
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,083
that you have at last

111
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,542
negotiated peace
with the Valtese.

112
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,959
Peace is good
for trade--

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,750
unless you happen
to be an arms merchant.

114
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,333
(<i> cackling</i> )

115
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,250
PICARD:
Excuse us.

116
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,542
Arms merchant!

117
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,583
In exchange
for the exclusive rights

118
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,542
to transport
all Kriosian products

119
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,834
to the Valt system--

120
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,291
May I suggest that
you arrange to meet

121
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,959
at another time
after the ceremony.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,583
Perhaps that
would be best.

123
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,500
But, but, but--
Listen...

124
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,083
have you had a chance
to see the dolphins yet?

125
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,375
This is something...
Deck seven.

126
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:37,542
You really don't
want to miss.

127
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,083
Dolphins?
Yes, but--

128
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,000
Picard to Worf.
Worf here, Captain.

129
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,291
Lieutenant, one
of the Ferengi

130
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,041
has just waylaid
Ambassador Briam.

131
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,667
Will you keep them
under a tight leash?

132
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:48,125
I don't want them
disrupting the conference.

133
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,083
Aye, sir.

134
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,667
Security
to cargo bay one.

135
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,375
Lieutenant?

136
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,417
One of the Ferengi.

137
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,709
Riker to Captain Picard.

138
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,458
What are you doing?

139
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,166
(<i> yelling</i> )

140
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,041
This is
a misunderstanding.

141
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,959
I was looking
for a barbershop.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
Apparently, I made
an incorrect turn, and--

143
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,583
Mr. Worf.

144
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,458
Get him out of here.

145
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,125
Confine them both
to their quarters.

146
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,125
Put a guard
on the door.

147
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,375
What is happening?

148
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,375
Emergence.

149
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,375
I am for you,
Alrik of Valt.

150
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,208
No, Kamala.

151
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,667
This is not Alrik.

152
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,625
This is Captain
Jean-Luc Picard

153
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,709
of the Federation
starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

154
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,083
That explains why you don't look
at all like your holographs.

155
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,125
I apologize, Captain.

156
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,583
As an empath,
I could sense your authority.

157
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,125
I assumed you were
Chancellor Alrik.

158
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,208
I'm afraid that I require
an explanation, Ambassador.

159
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,834
As do I,
Ambassador.

160
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,875
Why have I been brought
out of stasis prematurely?

161
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,125
It was
an accident.

162
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,709
This is quite
complicated.

163
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,917
Perhaps you and I--

164
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,375
It is not complicated
at all, Briam.

165
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:22,041
And the captain has no
tolerance for prevarication.

166
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,041
I'm a gift...
to Alrik of Valt.

167
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:28,834
You mean you are
using this ship

168
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,542
to transport a sentient
being as property?

169
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,625
Not as property.
As a gift.

170
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,959
And I was
concerned that

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,417
you might not
entirely understand.

172
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,000
PICARD:
Your concern was
well-justified, Ambassador.

173
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,542
You're angry.
Why?

174
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,417
There is a provision
in the Federation constitution

175
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,291
that protects an individual's
fundamental rights.

176
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,792
Now, once you came
aboard this ship--

177
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,834
You're coming to
my rescue.

178
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,208
What a kind and
generous purpose.

179
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,625
But, Captain, I do not need
to be rescued.

180
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:03,250
Kamala is the key to peace
between our two worlds.

181
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,500
Why?

182
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:05,875
In our history
there is a woman

183
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,417
known as Garuth,

184
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,417
who was loved by the brothers
Krios and Valt

185
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,792
with such passion
that an empire fell.

186
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,875
And the wars began
when Krios kidnapped Garuth

187
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,417
and took her
to our planet.

188
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,959
KAMALA:
Like her, I'm an
empathic metamorph--

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,375
the first
female metamorph

190
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:22,000
born on my world
for over 100 years.

191
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,500
A metamorph?

192
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,166
A mutant.

193
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,458
A biological curiosity,
if you will.

194
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,667
With the ability to sense
what a potential mate wants,

195
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,041
what he needs,

196
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,875
what gives him
the greatest pleasure,

197
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:38,709
and then to become that
for him.

198
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,500
You mean, you change according
to whatever man you're with.

199
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,959
Until I reach
the final stage of bonding,

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,542
when I must imprint
upon myself

201
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,959
the requirements
of one man--

202
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,458
to serve as his perfect
partner in life.

203
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,458
BRIAM:
You see,
male metamorphs

204
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,208
are somewhat common,
but females

205
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,083
are born only once
in seven generations.

206
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,333
So obviously,

207
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,458
they are greatly
sought after as mates.

208
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,792
Which explains the
Ferengis' interest.

209
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:06,875
This mating with Alrik
was arranged since her birth

210
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,834
by the leaders
of both worlds,

211
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,583
in the hopes
of restoring peace.

212
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,333
And you do this
of your own accord?

213
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,709
It is my sole purpose
in life.

214
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,959
Commander Riker,
escort her to quarters.

215
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,667
There's no need for you
to travel in the cargo bay.

216
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:29,917
Kamala... remain
in your room.

217
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,959
I will speak
with you shortly.

218
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,959
Why were you
in stasis?

219
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,583
Metamorphs have
a long and complex

220
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,542
sexual maturing
process.

221
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,125
I'm in the<i> finiis'ral,</i> 
the third and final stage.

222
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,792
It can be an uncomfortable
transition,

223
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:53,458
not only for me,
but for the men around me.

224
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,834
In what way?

225
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,458
My body is producing
an unusually elevated level

226
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,875
of what you would call
pheromones.

227
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,250
The effect can be
quite provocative.

228
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,417
Perhaps you sense it.

229
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,291
Uh... unfortunately,
I'm not an empath.

230
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,625
Oh, I think you're
more empathic

231
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,583
than you admit...

232
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,792
at least when
it comes to women.

233
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,458
I think you have me
at a disadvantage.

234
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,709
This is the com panel,
the replicator.

235
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,291
You can lower the lights
on a verbal command.

236
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,709
If you have any questions,
you can just ask the computer.

237
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,041
I'm beginning to sense
the elevated pheromones

238
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,959
you were referring to.

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,208
You were curious,
weren't you?

240
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,875
"Curious" isn't exactly
how I'd describe it.

241
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,500
You know what's remarkable
about empathic metamorphs?

242
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,709
You mean there's something
even more remarkable about you?

243
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,208
We learn so quickly
what stimulates a man

244
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,917
that the second time's
even better than the first.

245
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:31,709
Listen...

246
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,875
this has been
very educational,

247
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:39,250
but I make it
a policy

248
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,041
never to open
another man's gift.

249
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,208
I know my role
in history, Commander...

250
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,709
but it's going to be
a long voyage.

251
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,458
It certainly is.

252
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,917
We'll try to make you
as comfortable as possible.

253
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,500
Riker to bridge.

254
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,709
If you need me,
I'll be in holodeck four.

255
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,500
How can you simply
deliver her,

256
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:16,709
like a courier,

257
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,625
into a life of virtual
prostitution?

258
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,041
Beverly! Arranged marriages
have been the basis

259
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,500
of political alliances
in many cultures,

260
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:25,083
including our own.
I'm surprised at you.

261
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,625
She knows exactly
what she's doing.

262
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,959
She has been conditioned
since the day she was born

263
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,250
to believe it's
perfectly acceptable

264
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,750
to exist only
to please men.

265
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,375
But she was born
to do this!

266
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:36,125
And bred by those people
to seal a treaty

267
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,417
with a seductive
coup de grace.

268
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,959
All right.
Fine, good!

269
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,166
Let's throw the prime
directive to the winds.

270
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,792
Let's detain her here
against her will.

271
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:46,750
Let's destroy any chance
of peace between these worlds.

272
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,000
Let's interfere
in their society,

273
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,875
their customs...
That slave trader

274
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,542
who calls himself
an ambassador?

275
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,542
He has her confined
to her quarters.

276
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,959
She is a virtual
prisoner

277
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,792
in there.

278
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,542
I didn't know that.

279
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,250
Well, it<i> is</i> your ship.

280
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,792
Maybe there are a few things
you should find out about.

281
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,542
I'll talk to her
about it.

282
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,166
Good.

283
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,291
Lovely breakfast.

284
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,000
Indeed.

285
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,667
(<i> door chimes</i> )

286
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,625
KAMALA:
Come in.

287
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,959
Captain Picard,
what a delightful surprise.

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,250
Come in.
Thank you.

289
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:32,583
Are you comfortable?

290
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,583
Reasonably,
under the circumstances.

291
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,583
It has been brought
to my attention

292
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,000
that you have been told
to remain in here.

293
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,125
That's true, I'm afraid.

294
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,500
Against
your wishes?

295
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,083
At the request
of the ambassador,

296
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:49,083
who believes I might be...
disruptive to your crew.

297
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,333
The performance of
my crew is none

298
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,959
of the ambassador's
business.

299
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:56,083
You care about
my well-being.

300
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,500
Thank you, Captain.

301
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,583
I care about...

302
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,000
I care about what happens
onboard my ship.

303
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,709
Yes, I know.

304
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,625
This ship is very important
to you, isn't it?

305
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,834
Oh, yes.

306
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,750
Oh, yes, it is.

307
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:20,417
Are all captains' lives
so... solitary?

308
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,333
Or just yours?

309
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:27,333
Don't.

310
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,500
What?

311
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,375
Don't do this,
this--

312
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,000
This you do with men.

313
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,083
I'm afraid my premature
emergence from stasis

314
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,250
has left me a little...

315
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,709
vulnerable to the desires
I sense from men.

316
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,542
Nevertheless...

317
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,250
this is who I am,
Captain.

318
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,333
You might as well
ask a Vulcan to forgo logic,

319
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:53,041
or a Klingon
to be nonviolent.

320
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,208
I cannot change,
and I don't want to

321
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,667
until the time has come for me
to bond with my permanent mate.

322
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,041
Why does it bother you?

323
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,500
Frankly, it's difficult
for me-- for many of us--

324
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,667
to easily accept that
a sentient being

325
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:10,959
can live only
to be what

326
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,709
someone else
wants them to be.

327
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,750
But that's what gives
a metamorph pleasure.

328
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,875
But what about
<i>your</i> wishes?

329
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:21,375
<i>Your</i> needs?

330
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,000
They are fulfilled
by what I give to others.

331
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,500
But what about when
there are no others?

332
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:29,625
When you're alone?

333
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,333
I'm... incomplete.

334
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:37,834
What curious questions,
Captain.

335
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,875
Well, under
the circumstances,

336
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:44,667
I thought that
it would help if I...

337
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:47,667
if I learned more
about you.

338
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,875
But you know me
better than you realize.

339
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:55,333
I am independent,
forceful,

340
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:59,000
brilliant,
and adventurous.

341
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,875
Exactly as you would
have me be, Captain.

342
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,875
I'll speak to the ambassador
about easing your restrictions.

343
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,667
Thank you, Captain.

344
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,166
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45766.1.</i>

345
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,500
<i>We have reached the designated</i>
<i>coordinates for the conference</i>

346
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:37,667
<i>and await the arrival</i>
<i>of Chancellor Alrik.</i>

347
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,834
(<i> plays echoing tones</i> )

348
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,500
Ugh.

349
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:46,417
I forbid it.
Forbid it?

350
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,000
It's too dangerous, Captain.

351
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,750
She must remain
in her quarters.

352
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,333
You cannot confine her
against her will,

353
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,166
not onboard this ship,
Ambassador.

354
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,917
She is requesting
some freedom of movement,

355
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,125
and I intend
to give it to her.

356
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,667
She is still in
the<i> finiis'ral,</i>

357
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:01,375
the height of her
sexual allure, Captain.

358
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,667
Every man on this ship
will be fighting over her.

359
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:08,875
Not every man.

360
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,208
A chaperone?

361
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,417
I would be pleased
to escort you around the ship.

362
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,041
But I was hoping
we might spend

363
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,000
some more time
together, Captain.

364
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,542
I shall be busy
making arrangements

365
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,959
for the conference.

366
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,291
I'm very
knowledgeable

367
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,250
about Valt.
I could be helpful.

368
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,500
I think that
you should enjoy

369
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,291
the hospitality
of the ship.

370
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,959
Mr. Data here will see
to your every comfort.

371
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,709
If you will
excuse me.

372
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,458
The reason
your empathic powers

373
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,959
do not perceive
anything is because,

374
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,625
as an android,
I have no emotion.

375
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,250
I can understand
why Captain Picard

376
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,333
chose you to be
my chaperone.

377
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,208
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

378
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,792
MAN 1:
Oh! Whoa!

379
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,000
MAN 2:
Help me!

380
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,917
MAN 3:
Whoa!

381
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,083
MAN 4:
Oh, gracious!

382
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,083
I'll check in
with you later.

383
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,959
Excuse me,
but I'm absolutely certain

384
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,166
that we met once
at Paloris colony.

385
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,417
I've never been
to Paloris colony.

386
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,083
Neither have I.

387
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,208
Why don't we find out
what else we have in common?

388
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,834
Extremely
rude behavior.

389
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,667
He's just
being playful.

390
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,625
Perhaps you would care
for something to drink?

391
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,041
What are you all
having, boys?

392
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,792
Aldorian ale's our drink.

393
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,333
Then it's mine, too.
Yeah!

394
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah!
Bartender?

395
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,333
I believe they're
having a minor

396
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,583
problem with
the replicator.

397
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,583
Uh, they could use
a hand, Commander.

398
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:49,166
Excuse me.

399
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,375
I believe
I will stay.

400
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,959
Mr. Data's
protecting me tonight.

401
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,083
Oh, protecting you?
From what?

402
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,208
From you, I guess.

403
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,333
(<i> laughing</i> )

404
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,375
I told the captain
not to worry.

405
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:01,625
I just want
to have a good time

406
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,125
like anybody else.
(<i> men grunting</i> )

407
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,667
Come on down to deck seven.
We'll show you a good time.

408
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:10,083
Get rid of the android,
and we'll have some fun.

409
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,500
Is there a problem here?

410
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,542
No, sir.
No, no problem.

411
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,041
Tell him,
lady.

412
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,917
Thank you, Lieutenant.
The crowd seemed a bit

413
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,959
too ebullient
for comfort.

414
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,208
Perhaps you would
enjoy a nice

415
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,458
quiet visit
to the arboretum.

416
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:34,041
(<i> seductive growling</i> )

417
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,875
(<i> subtle growl</i> )

418
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,166
Perhaps the ambassador
is right.

419
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,709
Perhaps I should remain
in my quarters.

420
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,041
I have confidence

421
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,834
in the self-control
of my crew, Kamala,

422
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,917
but there are guests
and civilians onboard.

423
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,083
I understand.

424
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,792
I will volunteer
to stay in my quarters

425
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:03,542
under one condition--

426
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,083
that you will visit me.

427
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,250
There it is again.

428
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,417
What?

429
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,291
The wall you put
between us.

430
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,667
Kamala, you are
one day away

431
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:19,083
from an
arranged mating.

432
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,333
Why would you
want me

433
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,083
to visit you
in your quarters?

434
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,041
I said a visit.

435
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,500
I didn't ask you
to make love to me.

436
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:47,333
A Ventanan thimble.

437
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,667
Early Lapeongical
period, isn't it?

438
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,792
Yes, it is.

439
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,125
Have you seen
the Ventanan woven art

440
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,458
recovered from
the fourth colony dig?

441
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,583
Woven art?
Recovered intact?

442
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,041
They say the colors
are remarkably

443
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,458
vibrant
for their age.

444
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,917
I've read about them
for years,

445
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,375
but they were
so delicate

446
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:07,208
no one expected
to find any preserved.

447
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,625
How do you know
about them?

448
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:20,041
I stay informed on
a wide variety of subjects.

449
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,500
After all,
one never knows

450
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:25,375
when the conversation might turn
to Ventanan archeology.

451
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:30,542
Or to the "dark woman of raven
brows and mournful eyes"

452
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,083
in Shakespeare's sonnets.

453
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,166
Or to the gardens
of Les Eyries,

454
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,792
near the village
where you grew up.

455
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:41,041
Your empathic powers
told you all this about me?

456
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,250
Not quite that much.

457
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,417
Mr. Data helped
a little.

458
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,875
I see.

459
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,750
My empathic powers
can only sense

460
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:53,208
a man of deep passion
and conviction...

461
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,000
so controlled,
so disciplined.

462
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,083
I'm simply curious
to know what lies beneath.

463
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,875
Nothing.

464
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,917
Nothing lies beneath.

465
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:12,208
I'm... I'm really
quite dull.

466
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,750
I fall asleep
each night

467
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:16,959
with an old book
in my hands.

468
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:28,083
When a metamorph
finds you interesting,

469
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,375
do not take it lightly.

470
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,834
Oh, I'm not
taking it lightly.

471
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,375
I'm just trying...

472
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,750
to be as dull
as possible.

473
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:39,417
Will you visit me?

474
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,834
It would be inappropriate.

475
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,959
Is that a yes
or a no?

476
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,250
I'm sorry.

477
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:05,083
Even the walls
of Jericho fell, Captain.

478
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,041
Why are you doing
this, Kamala?

479
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,667
There can be
only one reason--

480
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:13,041
because some part
of you wants me to.

481
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:26,208
(<i> mumbling</i> )

482
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,000
Ambassador.

(<i> clinks coins</i> )

484
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:31,959
What is the meaning
of this?

485
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,375
Ah. I see you got
our message.

486
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:36,166
Is this some
sort of bribe?

487
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,208
Oh!
I am not amused.

488
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,583
No, Ambassador.

489
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,375
Well, your attitude
is quite understandable.

490
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:43,542
This is just
a sample.

491
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:46,375
The bribe is 10,000 more.

492
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,458
Ludugial gold--

493
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,458
the purest
in the galaxy.

494
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,000
We know the lifestyle
of the Kriosian ambassador

495
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:57,250
is far from comfortable.

496
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,333
You deserve
to live a life

497
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,583
of luxury.

498
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:01,834
How dare you
suggest...

499
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,542
The money!
What--

500
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,959
You drive
a hard bargain!

501
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,542
20,000-- but not
an ingot more.

502
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,875
We<i> must</i> have
the metamorph.

503
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:15,375
She is the answer
to a Ferengi prayer.

504
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:16,709
And we have
a ship waiting

505
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,750
to rendezvous with
us in three hours.

506
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:20,583
We can all transport
off together.

507
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,000
Yes!
Yes!

508
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,166
Thank you for sharing
that information.

509
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,208
I shall pass it on
to Captain Picard.

510
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,750
You can't do that!
Wait! Listen!

511
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,083
BRIAM: What are you doing?
Wait, let's discuss!

512
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,500
Let go of me!

513
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:33,542

that the conference

If I hadn't been removed

a delay might
have been possible.

531

00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,000
But there are points
in the negotiation

534
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,583
that Briam still
has to address.

535
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,959
You are familiar
with the issues.

536
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,333
Familiar, yes,
but...

537
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,375
I can't represent
your people's interests.

538
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,709
You can represent
the interests of peace.

539
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,667
My people will agree.
I'm certain of it.

540
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:51,291
But there are
customs and rituals

541
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,291
of which I have
no experience at all.

542
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:57,750
I told you, I'm extremely
knowledgeable about Valt.

543
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:00,417
I will help you prepare.

544
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:11,041
(<i> playing echoing notes</i> )

545
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,291
Ah.

546
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,458
<i>Torze-qua.</i>
<i>Torze-qua.</i>

547
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,834
That's right.

548
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,500
(<i> sighs</i> )

549
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:28,208
I'm reminded of piano lessons
when I was a child...

550
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,583
(<i> sighs</i> )

551
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:33,500
preparing for some...
dreaded recital.

552
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,709
Do you still play?

553
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,959
No.

554
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,208
I regret
that I gave it up.

555
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,250
It used to please
my mother.

556
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:45,041
But I...
didn't like performing

557
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,000
in front of
an audience.

558
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:49,583
Shy?

559
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,083
No.

560
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,709
Just not very good.

561
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,208
Thank you.

562
00:29:56,709 --> 00:29:58,834
For letting down
your guard,

563
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,875
if only
for a moment.

564
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,166
You will have to...

565
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,250
help me in the pronunciation
of this scroll.

566
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,875
What is it
about me you fear?

567
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:20,250
Kamala...
Do you find me
unattractive?

568
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,625
I find you unavailable.

569
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,250
I am being
terribly selfish.

570
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,208
I apologize.

571
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:32,792
We have something
in common, Captain.

572
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:35,375
When I was a child,
I took music lessons, too.

573
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,083
Really?
What instrument?

574
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,834
All of them.

575
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:41,917
The entire orchestra?

576
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,333
Plus a few
Valtese horns

577
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,333
that sound like braying
Targhee moonbeasts.

578
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:49,166
They are said to soothe
the nerves of Valtese men.

579
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:53,041
My mother never even
heard me play.

580
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,083
I was taken from her
when I was four

581
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:57,583
and sequestered in
a royal village where I was

582
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:00,375
prepared to fulfill
my destiny.

583
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:03,208
Sounds as if it were
a very lonely time for you.

584
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,166
On the contrary.

585
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:08,250
I had servants and tutors
at my side constantly.

586
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,625
You once asked me
what I'm like when I'm alone.

587
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,125
I've never been.

588
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,709
There was always
somebody there

589
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,959
to educate me
in literature

590
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,500
history, art, sex.

591
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,000
But I've been alone
on this journey,

592
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:30,333
and I've found
myself thinking about

593
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,583
all the curious questions
you asked.

594
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,709
You wanted
to know who I am.

595
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,834
And as I continue
to ask myself,

596
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:41,208
the only answer
that comes to me is,

597
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,250
"I am for you,
Alrik of Valt,"

598
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,208
because that's
the truth.

599
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:05,208
In a day, I will bond
with a man I've never met,

600
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,667
and I will turn myself
into what he wants me to be,

601
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:10,583
for the rest of my life.

602
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,166
I also once
asked you...

603
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:20,625
if you were doing this
of your own accord.

604
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:22,709
I'm honored to be chosen
to serve my people

605
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,625
as an emissary of peace.

606
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,417
But I find it ironic

607
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,667
on the eve
of the ceremony...

608
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:33,083
which I've spent my entire
life preparing for...

609
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,041
that I should meet
a man like you.

610
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,041
Riker to Picard.

611
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,875
Go ahead,
Number One.

612
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,917
The Valtese ship
has arrived.

613
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,417
Chancellor Alrik
is ready to beam aboard.

614
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:54,583
(<i> door opens</i> )

615
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,333
Captain Picard.

616
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,875
Chancellor Alrik.

617
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:06,917
Welcome onboard
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

618
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:09,333
Your first officer has
described the details

619
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:11,333
of the incident
with the Ferengis.

620
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,542
How is
the ambassador?

621
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,083
He has not regained
consciousness.

622
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,333
A tragedy.

623
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:17,792
Your willingness
to assist

624
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:20,291
is appreciated
by both our peoples.

625
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,000
Well, I'm doing my best,
although I'm finding

626
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,208
some of the rituals
rather demanding.

627
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,667
Rituals...
I am more concerned

628
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:30,250
about the remaining
provisions of the treaty.

629
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:31,709
The proposed
trade agreements

630
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,583
are not acceptable.

631
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:34,792
We still must review

632
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:36,667
the uncommitted
territories, as well

633
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:37,834
as discuss
the schedule

634
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,542
for exchange
of technology.

635
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,375
The Kriosians
have authorized me

636
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:44,083
to make several compromises
favorable to your position.

637
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,959
Good.
Tomorrow, then.

638
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,875
Briam has supervised
the reproduction

639
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:52,041
of the ancient temple
of Akadar on our holodeck.

640
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:56,250
Such a sentimental
people, these Kriosians.

641
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,375
It's hard to believe

642
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:59,875
we have
a common ancestry.

643
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:01,250
Please.

644
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,375
I suppose they've sent
the metamorph?

645
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,000
Kamala?
Yes.

646
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:07,875
She is looking forward
to meeting you.

647
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:09,959
I'm sure
she'll be satisfactory.

648
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,083
Between you and me,
Captain,

649
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:15,583
I am<i> far</i> more interested
in the trade agreements.

650
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:25,417
So, tell me quickly.

651
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:26,959
What is he like?

652
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,500
First impressions?

653
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:31,166
He's a thoughtful man,
informed.

654
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:34,750
Did he ask about me?
Yes.

655
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,208
What did you
tell him?

656
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,458
That you were looking
forward to meeting him.

657
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:42,291
When am I
to be presented?

658
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,875
It'll be the first
order of business,

659
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,792
tomorrow at 10:00.

660
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,750
Would you like
some tea?

661
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:50,917
Thank you, but...

662
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:53,417
I should prepare
for the ceremony.

663
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,875
Let me help you
with pronunciations.

664
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:58,458
Oh, I think I can muddle
my way through.

665
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,834
Please don't leave.

666
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,792
Talk to me.

667
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:07,083
I love the sound
of your voice.

668
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,333
I'll turn out the lights
and just listen.

669
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,250
I don't want
to be alone.

670
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,500
The lights stay on.

671
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:33,291
Earl Grey tea.
Hot.

672
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,166
Did you learn that
from Commander Data, as well?

673
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:46,041
I shall have to have
a talk with him.

674
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,125
Now that I know that you're
listening to my voice,

675
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:05,333
I find that I... can't
think of anything to say.

676
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,625
A starship captain
must encounter

677
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,583
all sorts
of life-forms.

678
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:15,208
Am I one of the most unique
you've ever met?

679
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,917
Please say yes.

680
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,166
Yes.

681
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,875
What a nice thing
to say.

682
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,917
Kamala, have I not done
everything possible

683
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,667
to discourage this?

684
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,625
Maybe that's the perfect way
to attract a metamorph.

685
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,709
I don't want to use you
as other men do.

686
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,250
But you're not
other men.

687
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:55,250
You could never
use me.

688
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:58,083
That's the very reason
why I'm with you tonight.

689
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:03,291
I should go.

690
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,291
And you have
an appointment

691
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,333
tomorrow morning,
early.

692
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:11,250
Light years away.

693
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,667
Quiet this morning.

694
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,792
I'm sorry.

695
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,583
Penny.
What?

696
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,041
For your thoughts.
Penny for your thoughts.

697
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,000
Do you have one?

698
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,417
I'm sure the replicator
will have one on file.

699
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:56,041
Beverly, may I take off
the uniform for a moment?

700
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,291
Captain?

701
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:02,875
I need to talk
to a friend.

702
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,959
Of course.

703
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,125
Actually,
it's all your fault.

704
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,458
Mine?

705
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,375
You insisted that I look
into her situation.

706
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,625
The metamorph?

707
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:19,208
The metamorph.

708
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,583
Kamala.

709
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,000
I spent quite a lot
of time

710
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:25,250
with her
in the past few days.

711
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:28,458
And you're right about
several things, Beverly.

712
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,000
Her entire existence

713
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,583
has been orchestrated
for this moment.

714
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:34,583
And she intends
to go through with it...

715
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:37,959
to help her people
end the war.

716
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,125
And you're saying there's
nothing you can do about it?

717
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,750
It isn't that simple.

718
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:52,333
I barely know
who she is, and...

719
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,667
and who she is
changes

720
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,083
the moment the next man
comes into the room.

721
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,959
And I find myself
hoping

722
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,500
that the next man
won't come in.

723
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:11,667
But, of course,
he does, and...

724
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:13,542
in a few hours
the ceremony will begin,

725
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:15,750
and she will...

726
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:18,000
she will mate
with a man

727
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,917
who cares more
about trade agreements

728
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:22,417
than he cares
about her.

729
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:26,333
And I can't help
thinking

730
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:30,667
how she will
be with him--

731
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:34,375
how she will change
to accommodate him.

732
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:39,333
I wish I knew how
I could help.

733
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,166
Perhaps I just needed
a shoulder.

734
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,583
Well, it's there
for you, Jean-Luc.

735
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,542
It always has been.

736
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,291
(<i> door chimes</i> )

737
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,125
KAMALA:
Come in.

738
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,166
Is it time?

739
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:19,875
Soon.

740
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,125
Do you have
any questions

741
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:23,291
about
the ceremony?

742
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,583
Many.

743
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:35,083
I will never
truly love him.

744
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,500
You've not even
met him.

745
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:38,625
It no longer matters.

746
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,166
I wish I could
convey to you

747
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,291
what it's like
to be a metamorph.

748
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,083
To feel the inner
strength of someone.

749
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,375
To realize that being
with him is opening

750
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:52,083
your mind and heart to
endless new possibilities.

751
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,417
To hear yourself say,

752
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:56,208
"I like myself when
I'm with him."

753
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,458
Kamala...

754
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,291
For a metamorph, there
is no greater pleasure,

755
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,000
and no greater wish,
than to bond with

756
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,208
that kind of mate
at the end

757
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,500
of the
<i>finiis'ral...</i>

758
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:14,625
as I've bonded
with you.

759
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:17,750
With me?

760
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:20,875
Who I am today,
I will be forever.

761
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:22,125
Data to Captain Picard.

762
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,291
Not now, Data.

763
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:24,750
But, sir,
Chancellor Alrik

764
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:27,709
is waiting to receive you
in holodeck seven.

765
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,125
Acknowledged.

766
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:38,250
You can't go through
with the ceremony.

767
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:39,875
Would you
ask me to stay

768
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,166
and ask two armies
to keep fighting?

769
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,208
Having bonded
with you,

770
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,625
I've learned
the meaning of duty.

771
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:48,917
He'll never know.

772
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:50,834
I'm still empathic.

773
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,125
I will be able
to please him.

774
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:03,000
I only hope
he likes Shakespeare.

775
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:44,875
KAMALA:
I am for you,

776
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:46,959
Alrik of Valt.

777
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,375
Your service to
both our peoples

778
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:19,834
is greatly
appreciated, Captain.

779
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,083
Your preparations
made

780
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,750
the negotiations
simple, Ambassador,

781
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,875
and...
Kamala was able

782
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:27,417
to guide me through
the rituals.

783
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:31,208
I must admit,
I am curious.

784
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,667
Curious?

785
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:34,291
I was chosen
for this mission

786
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:37,542
for a very simple reason--
I'm 200 years old.

787
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:40,000
The temptations of
a beautiful metamorph

788
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:42,083
do not easily reach me.

789
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:44,208
And yet, I would be lying
if I were to claim

790
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,208
that even at
my age, they--

791
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,667
they do not
reach me at all.

792
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:49,917
But you?

793
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:51,333
You worked with her,

794
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:54,250
side-by-side
for days.

795
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:57,500
How could you
resist her?

796
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:02,417
Ambassador,
have a safe trip home.

797
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,041
Energize.
