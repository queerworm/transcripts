1
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,041
I like to cook
all kinds of stuff--

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,000
like yogurt and raisin salad,

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:17,959
chocolate chip pancakes,
and purple omelets.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,667
Purple omelets?

5
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:22,417
You put grape juice
in the eggs.

6
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,417
Isabella doesn't
like it very much.

7
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,875
She says it tastes funny.

8
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:28,250
I can see her point.

9
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,417
Would you like some sugar
with your tea?

10
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,083
Yes, please.

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,417
Isabella,
would you like some?

12
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,750
Yes, but she takes
two cubes.

13
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:41,375
Mm-hmm.

14
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,792
I'll bet Isabella
is very pretty.

15
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,709
She's very, very pretty.

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,333
She has blonde hair

17
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,208
and a blue dress
with white buttons.

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,208
Her ears are pierced
and she's tall.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,750
Maybe you could draw me
a picture.

20
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,417
I'd love to see
what she looks like.

21
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,500
You don't think
she's real.

22
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:05,333
I think she's real for you,

23
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:09,041
and<i> that</i> is real enough
for me.

24
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,500
Honey, I think it's time
for you to go now.

25
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:14,417
You don't wanna
keep Keiko waiting.

26
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,500
I have to go plant
the nasturtiums now.

27
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,667
I'm Keiko's helper in
the arboretum today.

28
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,291
Is that so?

29
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,208
You go ahead, sweetie, and
be home in time for dinner.

30
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,250
I hope
I see you soon.

31
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,792
Maybe we can be friends.

32
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:30,250
Okay.

33
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:34,959
Counselor Troi?

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,125
Yes?

35
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,875
Isabella says
she likes you.

36
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:40,583
Why, thank you, Isabella.

37
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,500
I can understand your
concern, Ensign Sutter,

38
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:53,417
but really, you have
nothing to worry about.

39
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,834
It's a normal, healthy
activity for children

40
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,625
to engage in imaginary play.

41
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm-- I'm just afraid she's
not making any real friends.

42
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,417
She spends all of her time

43
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,750
with Isabella.

44
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,959
You've been moving
from starship to starship

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,250
since Clara was two years old.

46
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,750
Maybe Isabella provides
a constant companion.

47
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:16,166
She knows this is one friend
she won't have to leave behind.

48
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,583
You're probably right.

49
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,417
Give Clara a chance.

50
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,417
Once she learns to make
new friends on the<i> Enterprise,</i>

51
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,000
you'll probably find
that she'll leave

52
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,125
her imaginary world behind.

53
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,625
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45852.1.</i>

54
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,959
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has arrived</i>
<i>at FGC-47--</i>

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,083
<i>a nebula which has formed</i>
<i>around a neutron star.</i>

56
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:44,166
<i>We are eager to investigate</i>
<i>this unique formation.</i>

57
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,250
We've got elevated
quantities of hydrogen,

58
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,458
helium and trionium,
but nothing

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,667
the shields
can't handle.

60
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,500
Shields up.
Take us in, Ensign.

61
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,041
One-quarter impulse.

62
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,667
Aye, sir.

63
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,375
In order for the
lateral sensors

64
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,083
to complete their
scheduled observations,

65
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,750
additional processing time
will be required.

66
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,417
We could steal
a couple of hours

67
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,959
from the engineering team
while they're recalibrating

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
the thermal
interferometry scanner.

69
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:15,083
Will two hours
be enough time

70
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,375
to complete the
high-resolution series

71
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:17,875
on the neutron star?
No problem.

72
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:19,667
We'll just double up
the main sensor bandwidth

73
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,458
while they're freeing up
the lateral units.

74
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,834
Hmm.

75
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,709
And then after dinner,
then what?

76
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,291
We went to the holodeck

77
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,500
and took a walk on
the Champs Elysees.

78
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,500
The neural scanner still
seems to be a bit off.

79
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:38,250
Let's check the
sensor calibrations.

80
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,166
I'll run a diagnostic.

81
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,709
And...?

82
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,875
And?

83
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:53,000
After Paris?

84
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,583
He has shore leave
next month.

85
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,959
He asked me to go
to Risa with him.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,291
No problem, Nurse McClukidge
can cover for you.

87
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,959
I don't think
I'm going, Doctor.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,041
I hear it's a very
uninhibited atmosphere.

89
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,458
Personally, I don't
think I'm ready

90
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,375
for that kind of "fun."

91
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,125
Try to talk him
into Tavela Minor.

92
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,625
They have a cruise
down the Jokri River.

93
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:15,166
The iridescent currents
are beautiful.

94
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,083
(<i> giggles</i> )

95
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,166
See, Isabella?

96
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,792
You have to stick your finger
into the soil

97
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,333
as far as it can go.

98
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,000
We're making a hole
for the seeds.

99
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,917
Now, they need to be watered.

100
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,041
But the baby seeds
are very small,

101
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,125
so we mustn't give
them too much to drink.

102

Hello?

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,667
Is anybody there?

Isabella?

109
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:39,667
Hello, Clara.

110
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

111
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:17,834
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,417

00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,875
<i>to explore</i>

<i>to boldly go</i>

116
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,875
Isabella,
how come I can see you?

117
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,458
Is something wrong
with the way I look?

118
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,083
No. It's just
I've never seen you before.

119
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,375
Not for real.

120
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:43,583
Well, now, you can
see me for real.

121
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,375
Doesn't that make you happy?

122
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:48,542
Yes. It's wonderful.

123
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,750
Can we go now?

124
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:53,291
We better finish planting
the seeds first.

125
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,917
I'm tired of planting.

126
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,750
Let's do something else.

127
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,208
Like what?

128
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,625
Like... I would really
like to explore the ship.

129
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,166
We better finish
planting first.

130
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,583
I promised Keiko.

131
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:10,000
We can finish later.
Let's go look around.

132
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,750
I better ask my daddy.

133
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,250
Your daddy won't mind.

134
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,041
We can tell him later.
Come on.

135
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,166
So, what are we gonna
call this nebula?

136
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,750
"FGC-47" just doesn't
have the proper ring to it.

137
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,792
Why don't we call it
"Sutter's Cloud"?

138
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,208
(<i> chuckles</i> )

139
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,959
The rotational period
of the neutron star

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,625
is 1.35 seconds.

141
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,625
That's a bit on the long side.
Sutter, see if you can get

142
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,125
a reading on
the particle flux.

143
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,834
Aye, sir.

144
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,500
No, I was thinking
about something

145
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:42,583
more along the lines
of the "La Forge Nebula."

146
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,750
It's got sort of a majestic
sound, don't you think?

147
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:48,041
Given the selections,
I prefer FGC-47.

148
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,375
What was that?

149
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:55,250
It felt like we
hit something.

150
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,750
Shields have
registered an impact.

151
00:08:56,792 --> 00:09:00,083
However, sensors show
nothing in the vicinity.

152
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:04,875
Forward velocity is down
by .2% and dropping.

153
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,709
Engineering,
report.

154
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,875
There could be something wrong
with the shields, Captain.

155
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,041
We're checking it out now.

156
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,583
Systems are normal, sir.

157
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,834
So, did we hit
something or not?

158
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,583
Shields say yes.

159
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,917
Sensors say no.

160
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,750
This is very strange.

161
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:27,041
Ensign, give me a breakdown
on the shield energy conversion

162
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,875
and then run a spectral--
whoa!

163
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:30,375
Where did you come from?

164
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:33,375
I'm Clara Sutter.
That's my daddy.

165
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,792

166
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,000
Clara, you can't
be here right now.

167
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,250
But Isabella wanted
to see Engineering.

168
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,375
I-- I don't care what
Isabella wanted to see.

169
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,959
You go back to our
quarters right now.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,041
But, Daddy--

171
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,166
PICARD:
Bridge to La Forge.

172
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,500
Our speed is still dropping.

173
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:49,875
LA FORGE:
I hear you, Captain.

174
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,625
I'm increasing the power
to the impulse engines

175
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,166
but forward velocity just isn't
consistent with engine output.

176
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,583
PICARD:
Explanation.

177
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,083
It seems like there's
something increasing

178
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,625
the drag coefficient
on the ship,

179
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,208
but we can't find the source.

180
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,000
If we can't correct it,
we may have to reverse course

181
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,375
and leave the nebula.

182
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:05,458
Give me a couple of minutes
here, Captain.

183
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,875
Clara, now.

184
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,041
I'm sorry, Commander.

185
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,458
Why do you keep
disappearing like that?

186
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,208
The grown-ups don't
believe I'm real.

187
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,208
When they're around,
I have to be invisible.

188
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,792
Wait here.

189
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,000
The drag coefficient
continues to increase.

190
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,709
Our velocity has fallen by 12%.

191
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,959
(<i> console beeping</i> )

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,667
Velocity is increasing.

193
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,709
The ship's speed has stabilized
at one-quarter impulse.

194
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,500
That's great, Data.
What did you do?

195
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,500
I did nothing.

196
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:57,250
The problem seems
to have corrected itself.

197
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,709
Where did you go?

198
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,166
There was something
I had to do.

199
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,667
I don't have an
explanation, Captain.

200
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,834
We seemed to hit something,
then we started losing speed.

201
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,041
But, so far as we can tell,

202
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,542
there's nothing
out there to hit.

203
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,875
Could some sort
of damping field

204
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,333
have caused us to
lose velocity?

205
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,375
No. We have simulated
several such fields,

206
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,041
but were unable to reproduce
the same drag coefficient.

207
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,458
And we still don't
know why the problem

208
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,250
suddenly corrected itself.

209
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,542
Seems we're looking
at a unique phenomenon.

210
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,375
One that hasn't been
recorded before.

211
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:37,041
The question is-- do we stay
here and check it out?

212
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,750
Might be dangerous.

213
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:40,041
DATA: Since we have
only experienced

214
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,792
the phenomenon once,
it is impossible

215
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,333
to estimate the risks.

216
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,875
Captain, I'd like to stay
here for a little bit,

217
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:48,166
collect some samples
of the gaseous matter,

218
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,250
see what it tells us.

219
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,959
Agreed. Collect your
samples, Mr. La Forge.

220
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,041
We'll proceed
with caution.

221
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,625
Dismissed.

222
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,208
What's in here?

223
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,375
That's the door
to the cargo bay.

224
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,542
We can't go in there.

225
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:14,291
Let's go someplace
with a lot of people.

226
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,834
Okay.

227
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,375
Isabella, why are you
so serious lately?

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,625
What do you mean?

229
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:25,500
You haven't even
smiled once today.

230
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,542
You're my best friend,
Isabella.

231
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,000
Why?
I don't know.

232
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,542
Because we do things together
and we trade secrets.

233
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,959
Does everybody have
a best friend?

234
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,291
If they're lucky.

235
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,834
Before I had you,
I didn't have one.

236
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,041
Why not?

237
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,208
Every time I made
friends with someone,

238
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,083
my daddy's job
would change.

239
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,417
We moved to a new ship.

240
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,709
It takes time to
make a best friend.

241
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,625
How long?

242
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,166
It depends.

243
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,417
With you, not very long.

244
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,166
You always listened to me,
even when I was sad.

245
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:12,000
Clara, I'm glad
we're best friends.

246
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,583
Race you.

247
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,959
Okay.

248
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,041
Ready... set... go!

249
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,125
(<i> both laughing</i> )

250
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,750
(<i> gasps</i> )

251
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,792
This area is not designated
for children.

252
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:28,250
Are you lost?

253
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,000
Where are you
supposed to be?

254
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,291
We were only playing.
We're sorry.

255
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,625
Return to your quarters.

256
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,959
And we will forget
this incident.

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,709
Thank you.

258
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,333
Come on.

259
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,709
Hmm.

260
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,750
Okay, I've configured
the magnetic coil

261
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:07,333
to collect samples of gaseous
matter from the nebula.

262
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,083
Go ahead and activate
the beam emitter.

263
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,041
I'm setting the fractionater
to continuous cycle.

264
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,250
Good. We'll collect samples
from eight random sections.

265
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,834
That ought to give us
a reliable measure.

266
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,083
Commander, I...
I understand

267
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,333
you had a parent
who was in Starfleet.

268
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,417
Mm, two of them,
as a matter of fact.

269
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,667
My father was an exozoologist,
my mother, a command officer.

270
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,000
They must have been posted to
a lot of different assignments.

271
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,875
(<i> chuckles</i> )

272
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,792
Yeah, that's putting
it mildly.

273
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,875
They were always on the move.

274
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:42,250
Some of the times together,
sometimes separately.

275
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,959
I never knew whether or not
I was gonna be stationed

276
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,333
with my father
while he studied invertebrates

277
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,500
in the Modean system,
or on some outpost

278
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:50,041
near the neutral
zone with my mom.

279
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,250
Was that hard on you?

280
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,792
I don't remember
it that way.

281
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,875
It must have been
disruptive if you didn't stay

282
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:57,417
in one place long enough
to make friends.

283
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,583
Well... yeah, I suppose
there were some aspects

284
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,250
of my childhood
that were less than ideal,

285
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,834
but, to me, it was just
one long adventure.

286
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,000
Children are a lot
stronger than you think.

287
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,542
As long as they know
you love them,

288
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,875
they can handle
just about anything

289
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:14,083
life throws at 'em,
you know?

290
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,291
Thanks, Commander.
Mm-hmm.

291
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,959
No, it's a Samarian
coral fish

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,500
with its fin unfolded.

293
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,250
I believe what you are
seeing is the effect

294
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,166
of the fluid
dynamic processes

295
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,166
inherent in the large-scale
motion of rarefied gas.

296
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,750
No, no, first,
it was a fish,

297
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:40,000
and now, it's a
Mintonian sailing ship.

298
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,834
Where?
Right there.

299
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,417
Don't you see
the two swirls

300
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,417
coming together
to form the mast?

301
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,417
I do not see it.

302
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,125
It is interesting that people
try to find meaningful patterns

303
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,125
in things that are
essentially random.

304
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,750
I have noticed that the
images they perceive

305
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,792
sometimes suggest what
they are thinking about

306
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,333
at that particular moment.

307
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,875
Besides, it is clearly
a bunny rabbit.

308
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,458
Looks as though
someone's lost their way.

309
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,667
Excuse me.

310
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,792
Hello.
Are you looking for someone?

311
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:26,417
No, I brought Isabella
to see Ten Forward.

312
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,500
Oh, I see.

313
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:31,583
Well, ordinarily, we only would
let you in with a grown-up.

314
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,750
But since you brought Isabella,
you can be my guest.

315
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,208
Won't you join me?

316
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,959
Thank you.

317
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:48,500
Now, how about two<i> papalla</i> 
juices with extra bubbles?

318
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:54,000
Just one please.
Isabella isn't thirsty.

319
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,291
Oh.

320
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,125
One juice.

321
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,208
You aren't like
the other grown-ups.

322
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,667
Oh, no?

323
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:05,583
They don't think
Isabella's real.

324
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,750
Well, most grown-ups
have a hard time

325
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,875
with things
they can't see.

326
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:11,291
Why?

327
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:15,083
Well, because they get
preoccupied by other things.

328
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:17,750
Like what?

329
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:23,417
Like... how much fuel
it takes to power a ship,

330
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,792
or whether we should go to one
star system or another,

331
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:29,375
or whether little girls
should go to bed at 7:00,

332
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,792
or be allowed to
stay up till 8:00.

333
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,667
So, their heads get so full
that they forget

334
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:37,250
about the things that
are important to you and me,

335
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,959
like imaginary friends.

336
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,458
If the other grown-ups
don't understand,

337
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,125
how come you do?

338
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,417
Well, maybe because
when I was your age,

339
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,875
I had one.

340
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,375
You did?
Mmm.

341
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:51,875
What was she like?

342
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,792
It... wasn't a she.

343
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:56,875
What was<i> he</i> like?

344
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,959
Wasn't a he.

345
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,542
It?

346
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,291
It was a Tarkassian razorbeast.

347
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,083
It had dark brown fur
and gold eyes

348
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,792
and huge spiny wings,

349
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:13,834
and it would fly past so fast,
nobody could see it but me.

350
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,625
Sounds scary.

351
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:16,834
Oh, it was...

352
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,917
especially
when he smiled.

353
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,333
But the best thing about him

354
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,208
was I could curl up
on his furry belly,

355
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,792
and he had the softest
purr you ever heard.

356
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:32,291
Put me right to
sleep every night.

357
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,750
I tell you, that razorbeast
was a good friend.

358
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,542
So is Isabella.

359
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,834
(<i> door opens</i> )

360
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,041
Hello, Clara.

361
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,375
Hello.
Clara and Isabella and I

362
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,834
were just having
a conversation.

363
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,250
Would you and Isabella
like to come for a walk with me?

364
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,792
I guess so.

365
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,500
Bye.
Bye, Clara.

366
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,333
Bye, Isabella.

367
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:09,583
Clara, you haven't been
on the ship very long,

368
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,917
so maybe you don't know.

369
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:14,166
But Ten Forward is
usually for grown-ups.

370
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,583
I know that.

371
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:19,542
I didn't wanna go,
but Isabella wanted to see it.

372
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,583
If Isabella is making you
do things you know are wrong,

373
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,959
then you must tell her
it's not acceptable.

374
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,125
I try to,
but she doesn't listen.

375
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,917
Deck 32.

376
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,000
Clara, do you want me
to talk to Isabella?

377
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:45,166
Isabella, it's not
very nice to get Clara

378
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,375
to do things that she
isn't supposed to.

379
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,500
She's over there.

380
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,500
From now on, I want
you to ask a grown-up

381
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,667
before you go to any place
that's off-limits.

382
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,083
What does she say?

383
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,875
She said...

384
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:13,750
Clara, please tell me
what Isabella said.

385
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,208
She said...

386
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,792
you better
leave us alone.

387
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,583
I'm a little concerned at
the turn this is taking.

388
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,542
It seems Clara is beginning
to do inappropriate things

389
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,125
and blaming them
on Isabella.

390
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,750
She came into
Engineering today.

391
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:36,083
She said it was
Isabella's idea.

392
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,542
I don't think it's
too serious yet,

393
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,166
but we should make
more of an effort

394
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,875
to get her involved with
real friends her own age.

395
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:45,750
The children's center's having
a ceramics class this afternoon.

396
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,041
Why don't I take Clara?

397
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,500
I think
she'd like that.

398
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:51,166
I'll see if there's any room
left in the class.

399
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,500
In the meantime,
I think you should

400
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,792
make yourself more
available to Clara.

401
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:58,208
Let her know she doesn't
have to rely on Isabella

402
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,750
when she needs
someone to talk to.

403
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,625
Counselor, thank you.

404
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,375
Are you mad at me?

405
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,709
I'm sorry I got
you into trouble.

406
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,583
That's okay.

407
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,542
Are we still
best friends?

408
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,500
Here, you can help me put
this together, if you want.

409
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:34,834
Clara, why are
grown-ups so mean?

410
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,458
They're not mean.

411
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,542
They're just more
serious than we are.

412
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,834
Sometimes I wish they
would just go away.

413
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,959
You do?

414
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,417
Yes. I don't like them.

415
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,125
I'm bored.

416
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,083
Let's go back
to Engineering.

417
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,959
We're not allowed
to go there.

418
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,500
I thought we were best friends.

419
00:21:58,542 --> 00:21:59,750
We are.

420
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,542
Then why won't
you play with me?

421
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,834
I told you.

422
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,458
You always listen
to the grown-ups.

423
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,250
You don't care about me.

424
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,709
That's not true.

425
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,959
I thought we'd have
fun together

426
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,834
once you could
really see me.

427
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,834
I thought you'd like me.

428
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,834
Let's go to
Engineering, Clara.

429
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,792
Just for a little while.
No one will know.

430
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,625
It'll be our secret.

431
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:28,375
And if they find us,
we'll tell them we got lost.

432
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:29,583
(<i> door chiming</i> )

433
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:30,709
Who is it?

434
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,583
Counselor Troi.

435
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:40,417
Hello, Clara.
Hi.

436
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,750
I came to ask if you'd like
to go to a ceramics class.

437
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:46,417
Can Isabella come, too?

438
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:49,875
No. Let's do something
with Isabella another day.

439
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,583
Well... okay.

440
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:24,208
Sir, as we move deeper
into the nebula,

441
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,875
sensors indicate that the
levels of helium and trionium

442
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:28,792
are continuing to rise.

443
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,667
Is it something that the
shields can't handle?

444
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,417
No, sir, we are well
within tolerance levels.

445
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,875
Mr. Data?

446
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,291
Shields have
registered an impact.

447
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,458
But the sensors showed
nothing out there, right?

448
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,375
There is no indication of
anything near the ship.

449
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,458
Forward velocity
is dropping, Captain.

450
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,959
Down by .4%.

451
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,041
Can we go to warp speed?

452
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,291
Until we determine the cause
of the drag coefficient,

453
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,500
I would not
recommend it, sir.

454
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:58,375
Forward velocity down by 1.1%.

455
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:00,542
Ensign, increase power
to the impulse engines.

456
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,000
Aye, sir.

457
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,250
Impulse engines
now at full power.

458
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,875
We are no longer losing speed.

459
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:09,667
Forward velocity is
holding steady.

460
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:11,417
The drag coefficient
is still present,

461
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,834
but it has stabilized.

462
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,625
Bridge to Commander Riker.

463
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,542
Check with Mr. La Forge,
see if he found anything

464
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,375
in the matter sample
from the nebula.

465
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,041
RIKER:
On my way, sir.

466
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:24,834
Any luck?

467
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,417
Yeah, take a look at this.

468
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,208
We tried radiating
the subject matter

469
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,792
with just about everything
we could think of.

470
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,542
We didn't find anything
until we subjected it

471
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:35,083
to a high-frequency
warp field.

472
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,917
We think this is what
we've been running into.

473
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,333
RIKER:
Do you know what it is?

474
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,542
We think so, now that
the sensors can read it.

475
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:44,000
It seems to be a highly
cohesive form of plasma,

476
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,500
like a strand of energy.

477
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:47,917
We figure it's a segment
of just part of a network

478
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,542
of much larger strands.

479
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,375
When these things come
in contact with our shields,

480
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,625
it produces a resonant effect,
and that creates

481
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,500
the drag coefficient
we've been experiencing.

482
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,083
Is there anything like this
on record?

483
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,750
No, sir.

484
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:00,875
Do you know how many of them
there might be?

485
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,417
No, but if we run
the warp field generators

486
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,750
through the deflector grid,

487
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:06,291
we could radiate a field
outside the ship.

488
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,625
We'd be able to see
for ourselves.

489
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,291
Mm-hmm.
Let's do it.

490
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,458
(<i> children conversing</i> )

491
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:22,959
Alexander, I thought
you might like a partner.

492
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,750
This is Clara Sutter.

493
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,250
She's new on the
<i>Enterprise.</i>

494
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:30,000
Clara, meet
Alexander Rozhenko.

495
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:33,208
I'm making a cup for my father.
Want to help?

496
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,291
Go ahead.

497
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:44,583
Well, you're supposed
to put 'em in a row...

498
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,250
like this.

499
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,709
Clara, would you like
some clay of your own?

500
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,750
WOMAN:
Here, honey.

501
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,917
I've never made a cup before.

502
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,417
How do you make
the round part?

503
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:00,917
Well, it's easy.

504
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,417
You take a big piece
of clay like this,

505
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,875
you push your hand into it.

506
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,667
Warp field generators
are standing by.

507
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:15,959
Captain, we should be able
to illuminate any strands

508
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,917
within 2,000 kilometers
of the ship.

509
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,250
PICARD:
Proceed.

510
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,333
Initiating field generation.

511
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,041
Remarkable.

512
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,125
DATA:
It is an irregular lattice

513
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:42,291
composed of approximately
47 million strands of energy.

514
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,625
Captain, with this many of them,
the resonant effect

515
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:46,709
on our shields
could cause a problem.

516
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,709
Agreed.

517
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,250
Ensign, bring us about.
Take us out of the nebula.

518
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,333
That may be difficult, sir.
I am detecting

519
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,542
a significant number
of strands behind us.

520
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:56,834
Do your best, Ensign.

521
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,417
Aye, sir.

522
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,542
Hot chocolate.

523
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,208
Mmm.

524
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:22,458
Computer, I need my appointment
schedule for next week.

525
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:09,125
Kryonian tigers
aren't so scary.

526
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:11,041
I saw one once.

527
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,625
You did?

528
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:16,375
My father took me to
the zoo on Brentalia.

529
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,583
All the tiger did
was lick my hand,

530
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,250
and he smelled funny.

531
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,917
(<i> chuckles</i> )

532
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:28,125
I think we need more water.

533
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,000
I'll get some.

534
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:36,834
Isabella?

535
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,750
Clara!

536
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:40,750
I didn't do it.

537
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:42,375
Who did?

538
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:45,166
It was Isabella.

539
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,083
I don't see anybody.

540
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,875
She's invisible.

541
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:53,542
I spent two weeks on that.

542
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,417
That was really mean.

543
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:58,917
I didn't do it.
I didn't.

544
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,250
Clara...

545
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:03,041
there's no such thing
as invisible people.

546
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,333
You're lying.

547
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:06,875
Hey!

548
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:09,041
Isabella, stop!

549
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,166
Clara?

550
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,959
Why were you being
so mean to me?

551
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,834
Why'd you do that
to my friend?

552
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:44,500
Because you ran
away from me.

553
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,750
You left me alone.

554
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:49,625
I had to do everything
by myself.

555
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,417
You're scaring me.

556
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,959
I was going to
protect you, Clara.

557
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,667
I liked you.

558
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:58,125
But now,
I don't care.

559
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,500
Now, when the others come,

560
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:04,208
you can die
along with everyone else.

561
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,792
Status, Mr. Data?

562
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:19,667
At our current speed,
we will clear the nebula

563
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:21,709
in 12 minutes,
four seconds.

564
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,959
(<i> sighs</i> )
Continue a full sensor sweep.

565
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,208
I want all the information
we can gather.

566
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:35,125
Captain, forward velocity
is down by .6%.

567
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:41,208
Velocity down by 2.4%

568
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,166
Mr. Data?

569
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,959
We are moving through
a dense concentration

570
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,500
of energy strands.

571
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,375
Can we go to warp?

572
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,667
Stress on the hull
would be too great.

573
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,792
Captain, the density
appears to be lower

574
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:01,250
off the starboard bow.

575
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,959
Ensign, bring us to a
bearing 030-mark-5.

576
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,375
Aye, sir.

577
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,959
Forward velocity holding.

578
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,375
Steady as she goes.

579
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:25,750
Is something wrong
with the cake?

580
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:27,208
Excuse me?

581
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,792
Well, I see you
sitting here with a piece

582
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:30,875
of untouched chocolate cake
in front of you.

583
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,500
I assume something's
wrong with the cake,

584
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,000
or something's
bothering you.

585
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:37,291
I'm sure the cake's fine.
I've just been thinking.

586
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,291
Let me guess.

587
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:43,000
About the little girl
with the imaginary friend?

588
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:45,291
I'm wondering if I'm doing
the right thing.

589
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,083
How so?

590
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,625
Well, I know
the best thing to do

591
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:52,250
is to gradually wean her
away from her fantasy.

592
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:54,208
And she did make
some new friends today

593
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,125
and had a good time.

594
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,000
But?

595
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,333
But I can't help feeling

596
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,166
that I'm taking something
from her--

597
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,583
something precious--

598
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:06,500
a part of her childhood
she'll never have again.

599
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:08,250
Hmm.

600
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:11,375
Well... I'm not
sure about that.

601
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:15,750
I was, uh, just telling Clara
about<i> my</i> imaginary friend.

602
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:18,583
You have an
imaginary friend?

603
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:19,875
Mmm.

604
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:22,417
A Tarkassian
razorbeast.

605
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,041
It protected me.

606
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,625
I knew as long as that
razorbeast was around,

607
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:27,709
nothing could hurt me.

608
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,166
You know,
over the years

609
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,125
his body kind of
faded away,

610
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,291
but the<i> idea</i> stayed.

611
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:37,083
And I just don't seem to talk
to him as often as I used to.

612
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,250
You still talk to it?

613
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,834
Oh, yeah.

614
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,917
When I'm afraid,
or I get confused

615
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:45,208
or a little scared.

616
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,625
I just don't think you
should have to give up

617
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,709
an imaginary friend.

618
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,959
Ensign Sutter to
Counselor Troi.

619
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,041
Go ahead, Ensign.

620
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,333
Would you come to my quarters?

621
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,250
I'm having a problem
with Clara.

622
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,875
I'm on my way.

623
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,333
She won't even go
into her room.

624
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:09,250
She's terrified that
Isabella's going to hurt her.

625
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:15,250
Clara?

626
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:18,000
Your father tells me that
Isabella has been saying

627
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,125
some very bad
things to you.

628
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,000
What did she say?

629
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:26,792
She said they're going
to come and kill everyone.

630
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:28,542
Who's going to come
and kill everyone?

631
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,792
The others, like her.

632
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,208
Did she say why?

633
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:40,542
I know you're very frightened.

634
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,500
Sometimes what we imagine

635
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:45,125
can be just as scary
as something real.

636
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,959
But I promise you,

637
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,834
there is no way
Isabella can harm you

638
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,583
or anyone on this ship.

639
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,875
But she's not
imaginary anymore.

640
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:58,250
She's real now.
I can see her.

641
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,000
You can see her?

642
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,667
Yes.

643
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,417
If I go with you
and hold your hand,

644
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:07,208
will you go into your room?

645
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:09,917
I think so.

646
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:13,500
We'll make sure Isabella
isn't anywhere around.

647
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:14,959
Okay?

648
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,667
Come on.

649
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,250
Do you see anybody?

650
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,542
Let's look under the bed.

651
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:39,333
Is she there?

652
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,792
Okay. Where else?

653
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,792
Is she behind here?

654
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,000
Maybe Isabella
has gone home.

655
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,083
Let's see.

656
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:57,125
Anything here?

657
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:07,959
Maybe Isabella knows that
you've got new friends now.

658
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,458
In fact, I'll bet

659
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,000
she doesn't come around
as much anymore.

660
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,417
Maybe.

661
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:17,583
What about
in the closet?

662
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,250
Okay.

663
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:24,333
Anybody in here?

664
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,125
Looks pretty
empty to me.

665
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,000
(<i> gasps</i> )

666
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,834
(<i> groans</i> )

667
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,125
(<i> screams</i> )

668
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:43,375
She was 11, maybe 12,
blonde hair.

669
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,000
Clara.
Clara's sleeping.

670
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:49,041
She's going
to be fine.

671
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:52,083
Her bioelectrical processes
were severely disrupted.

672
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:55,375
It's as if the energy was
pulled right out of her body.

673
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:56,959
Captain.

674
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,667
Clara has told me

675
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,875
that her imaginary friend
has been making threats.

676
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:06,333
She claimed that
others are on the way

677
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,709
and that they had
plans to kill

678
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,250
everyone on the ship.

679
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:13,208
Picard to Lieutenant Worf.

680
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,834
Worf here, sir.

681
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,834
Lieutenant,
we've established the presence

682
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,166
of what appears to be
an alien entity on board.

683
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,208
It seems the entity has
manifested itself

684
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,709
in the form of a
12-year-old human girl

685
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,875
who's been seen
with Clara Sutter.

686
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,542
She has blonde hair
and blue eyes.

687
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:28,875
WORF:
And a blue dress.

688
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:31,166
Yes, sir, I have seen her.

689
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,417
PICARD:
When?

690
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,000
Two days ago
near Engineering.

691
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,792
She was with Miss Sutter.

692
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,291
Security alert, Mr. Worf.
Keep a good lookout.

693
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,959
WORF:
Aye, sir.

694
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
She insisted on
talking to you.

695
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,417
It's about Isabella.

696
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,166
What about her, Clara?

697
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,041
I think her
feelings were hurt.

698
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,667
She said she liked me,

699
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:01,375
and she liked
being with me.

700
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:04,083
She was my friend.

701
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:07,208
She only got mean when I stopped
paying attention to her.

702
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,083
Did she say when the
others were coming?

703
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,542
All right, thanks, sweetie.
You go back to bed now.

704
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:14,583
We'll handle this.

705
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,834
But Daddy--
PICARD: Clara...

706
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,500
if we need your help again,

707
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:19,959
I hope we can
count on you.

708
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,709
Yes, Captain.

709
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:25,792
RIKER: Captain Picard,
report to the Bridge.

710
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,250
On my way.

711
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:34,709
Report.

712
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,917
Our speed is down by 22%.

713
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:41,125
Strand density is ten times
what it was, Captain.

714
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,083
We can't take many
more of these hits.

715
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,875
All stop.

716
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:53,291
Sir, something is
moving toward us.

717
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,959
Bearing 103,
mark 024.

718
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,959
On screen.

719
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,667
DATA: It appears to
be an energy vortex

720
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:03,583
of highly
complex patterns,

721
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,375
possibly a life form.

722
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,834
Red alert!

723
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:11,375
It is in direct physical contact
with our shields.

724
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:14,834
Shield strength
dropping to 75%.

725
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,166
72%.

726
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,709
The damn thing's feeding
off our shields.

727
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,125
Mr. Data, remodulate
our shield frequencies.

728
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,875
Aye, sir.

729
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,959
No effect.

730
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,959
Shield strength
has dropped to 64%.

731
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,250
We've got about eight minutes

732
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:38,125
before this thing drains
our shields.

733
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:41,208
Any ideas?

734
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,250
Isabella?

735
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,625
Isabella?

736
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,208
Don't you wanna talk to me?

737
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,125
I'm not mad at you.

738
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:22,417
Isabella?

739
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,250
We know you've been
on this ship

740
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:33,709
for some time now,
and that you're posing

741
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,125
as Clara's friend

742
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,542
and that you've
been threatening her.

743
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,834
We can only assume that
there is some connection

744
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,667
between yourself
and the life-forms

745
00:39:44,709 --> 00:39:46,750
attacking this ship.

746
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:54,667
You're obviously
an intelligent being.

747
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:57,041
There's no reason
to hide from us.

748
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,250
Talk to us?

749
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:12,917
Or can you only communicate
by threatening a small child?

750
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,959
I'm scared, Isabella.

751
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,417
Who are you?

752
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,959
I came here to determine

753
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,750
whether you were a threat
to us, and to examine

754
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:39,208
the purity of
your energy sources.

755
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,792
Energy?

756
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,500
Is that why
you're draining our shields?

757
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:44,000
Yes.

758
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,542
The emissions for your
graviton field generators

759
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:50,208
are far richer than our
normal sources of energy.

760
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,125
Picard to Bridge.
Report.

761
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,834
RIKER:
Shields are down to 3%.

762
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:59,125
We're diverting all
available power.

763
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,917
Acknowledged.

764
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,208
If it's energy that you want,

765
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,083
we have other ways
of providing it.

766
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,375
You needn't destroy us.

767
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:08,625
You should be
destroyed.

768
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:11,834
You're cruel,
uncaring creatures.

769
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:13,250
What makes you say that?

770
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,250
The way you
treat Clara.

771
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,125
In what way have we
mistreated her?

772
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:19,917
You wouldn't let her
do what she wanted to,

773
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:22,792
or go where she wanted to.

774
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:24,709
You mean where
<i>you</i> wanted her to.

775
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,500
What difference
does it make?

776
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:28,166
You were taking her to places

777
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:30,208
that were inappropriate,
even dangerous.

778
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,834
I wouldn't have let
anything happen to her.

779
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,709
We didn't know that.

780
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,792
We didn't even know
if you were real.

781
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:41,709
All we knew was that a little
girl's imaginary friend

782
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,208
was frightening her,
threatening her.

783
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,834
That was only
after you told Clara

784
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:49,333
not to be my friend.

785
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:54,917
I understand.

786
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:59,458
You are seeing this ship,

787
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,917
all of us from
a unique perspective,

788
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,500
from a child's point of view.

789
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:08,041
It must seem
terribly unfair

790
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,834
and restrictive to you.

791
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:14,083
As adults, we don't
always stop to consider

792
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,709
how everything
we say and do shapes

793
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,583
the impressions
of young people.

794
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:22,083
But if you're judging us
as a people

795
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,333
by the way
we treat our children--

796
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,667
and I think there can be
no better criterion--

797
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:28,542
then you must
understand

798
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:30,875
how deeply
we care for them.

799
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,625
When our children
are young,

800
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:35,125
they don't understand
what might be dangerous.

801
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:39,417
Our rules are to keep them
from harm, real or imagined,

802
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,333
and that's part of
the continuity

803
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,792
of our human species.

804
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,125
When Clara grows up,

805
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:47,417
she will make rules
for her children

806
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:51,959
to protect them,
as we protect her.

807
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:57,875
Please, don't hurt us.

808
00:42:57,917 --> 00:43:00,750
If you still wanna
be my best friend,

809
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,834
I'd like that very much.

810
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,250
Status, Number One.

811
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,583
We're clear of
the strands.

812
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:30,458
We'll have full warp
capability in 20 minutes.

813
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,125
Inform all sections
we'll be leaving this area

814
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:35,750
in one hour.

815
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:37,500
Sir?
Mr. La Forge,

816
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:40,875
I want you to drive
the warp engines to full power

817
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:44,000
and direct an energy beam
out into the nebula.

818
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:45,583
Aye, sir.

819
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,291
I came to say I'm sorry
I frightened you.

820
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,917
That's okay.

821
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:04,917
And I misled you.

822
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:07,250
I wasn't really
your Isabella.

823
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:09,792
For a while, you were.

824
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:12,083
I never had
a friend before.

825
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:15,500
I'm sorry I have
to go away.

826
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:18,709
Do you think you'll
ever come back?

827
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,583
I hope so.

828
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:23,166
So do I.
