00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:05,375
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41590.5:</i>

2
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:07,834
<i>Having dropped off</i>
<i>Counselor Troi</i>

3
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:10,000
<i>at Starbase G-6</i>
<i>for a shuttle visit home</i>

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,625
<i>we were fortunately close</i>
<i>to the Sigma III solar system</i>

5
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,208
<i>when its Federation colony</i>

6
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,208
<i>transmitted an urgent call</i>
<i>for medical help.</i>

7
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,583
<i>An accidental explosion</i>
<i>has devastated</i>

8
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,834
<i>a mining operation there.</i>

9
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:23,875
Include a burn unit
with each kit.

10
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,083
Upon arrival, identify the most
critically injured

11
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,875
and beam them up to Cargo Bay 6.

12
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,959
PICARD:
Dr. Crusher,
this is the Captain.

13
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,208
Dr. Crusher here.

14
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,542
Additional information.

15
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:36,792
The number of colonists
at the site is 504.

16
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:38,959
Are you prepared for that many,
Doctor?

17
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,583
We believe so, sir.

18
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,000
Captain, we are now

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,667
at warp 9.1, sir.

20
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:46,917
Which will bring us to the
colony in 3.2 hours, sir.

21
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:50,000
Captain, I have a schematic
from the explosion site.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,709
It suggests the cause may
be a methane-like gas

23
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:54,375
seeping in
from underground.

24
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,875
Captain,
I'm picking up

25
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,291
a force field out there
of some kind. It's almost...

26
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,834
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

27
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,041
The Q entity, sir.

28
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,417
It is identical
to the grid we
encountered when...

29
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,792
It reads solid, sir.

30
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:12,542
Emergency, full stop.

31
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:14,166
Reversing power, sir.

32
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,625
Not now, damn it, Q.

33
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,834
Shields and deflectors up, sir.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,875
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

35
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:29,625
Now reading
full stop, sir.

36
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:33,667
Q:
<i>Humans, I thought by now that</i>
<i>you would have scampered back</i>

37
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,625
<i>to your own little star system.</i>

38
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,250
If this is Q I'm addressing

39
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,917
we are on a mission of rescue to
aid a group of badly injured...

40
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:45,792
<i>We of the Q have studied</i>
<i>our recent contact with you</i>

41
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:47,250
<i>and are impressed.</i>

42
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,125
<i>We have much to discuss</i>

43
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,000
<i>including, perhaps,</i>
<i>the realization</i>

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,625
<i>of your most impossible dreams.</i>

45
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,792
However intriguing
that may be, Q

46
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,834
we are in the midst
of an urgent journey.

47
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:58,917
Once that is completed,
then perhaps...

48
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:00,500
<i>You will abandon that mission,</i>
<i>Captain.</i>

49
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,375
<i>My business with you</i>
<i>takes precedence.</i>

50
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,250
<i>If my magnificence</i>
<i>blinds you...</i>

51
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,709
<i>then, perhaps,</i>
<i>something more familiar...</i>

52
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:16,917
Starfleet Admiral Q,
at your service.

53
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,583
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

54
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:48,959
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

55
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,709
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

56
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,458
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

57
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:59,041
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

58
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:04,041
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

59
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,125
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

60
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,500
<i>Our rescue mission</i>
<i>to the Sigma III solar system</i>

61
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,083
<i>has been halted</i>

62
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:15,250
<i>by an immense grid</i>
<i>and an untimely visit from Q.</i>

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,458
You're no
Starfleet admiral, Q.

64
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,917
Neither am I an Aldebaran
serpent, Captain

65
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:24,000
but you accepted me
as such.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, he's got us
there, Captain.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,083
Ah, the redoubtable Commander
Riker, whom I noticed before.

68
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,709
You seem to find this all
very amusing.

69
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:35,458
I might... if we weren't
on our way to help

70
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,000
some suffering
and dying humans...

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,458
Aw, your species is always
suffering and dying.

72
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,208
PICARD:
No, Lieutenant Worf!

73
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,417
You'll make no move against him
unless I order it.

74
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:47,792
Pity.

75
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,667
You might have learned
an interesting lesson--

76
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:53,667
macro head
with a micro brain!

77
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,583
(<i> growling</i> )

78
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:59,083
You said you had the realization

79
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:03,417
of impossible dreams
to offer us?

80
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:05,417
When this rescue is completed

81
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:07,041
I am prepared to listen
carefully

82
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,375
to whatever proposal you wish
to make, and subject

83
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,750
to its being
acceptable...

84
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,291
Subject to your own foolish
human values?

85
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,208
Oh, come, Picard.
Why do you distrust me so?

86
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,875
Why?

87
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,125
At our first meeting,
you seized my vessel

88
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,667
you condemned all humans
as savages

89
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,709
and, on that charge,
you tried us

90
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:25,875
in a post-atomic

91
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,792
21st century
court of horrors

92
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,291
where you attacked my people.

93
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,917
You again seized my vessel...

94
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,208
And that angered you, did it?

95
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,041
"Seized my vessel,
seized my vessel..."

96
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,458
You interfered
with our Farpoint mission.

97
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:41,792
You threatened to convict us
as ignorant savages

98
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,792
if, while dealing with
a powerful and complex life-form

99
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:47,542
we made the slightest mistake,
and when that didn't happen...

100
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:50,291
The Q became interested
in you.

101
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,792
Does no one here understand
your incredible good fortune?

102
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:56,083
"Seized my vessel!"

103
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,333
These are the complaints
of a closed mind

104
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,125
too accustomed
to military privileges.

105
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:06,125
But you, Riker--
and I remember you well--

106
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,125
what do you make of my offer?

107
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,000
We don't have time
for these games.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,709
Games?

109
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,959
Did someone say games?

110
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,750
And perchance
for interest's sake...

111
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,500
a deadly game?

112
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,959
To the game.

113
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,208
RIKER:
Where are we?

114
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,125
Obviously a class-M world--

115
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,709
gravity and oxygen,
within our limits.

116
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,959
Twin moons.

117
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,208
Where are we?

118
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,792
Considering the power

119
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:55,000
demonstrated by Q
the last time...

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
anywhere--

121
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,709
assuming this place even exists.

122
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,583
But it won't be boring.

123
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,083
If Q is anything,
he's imaginative.

124
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,000
Apparently our Captain
wasn't meant to be here with us.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,375
Security, this is the Captain.

126
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,417
Security?

127
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,917
Engineering, this is the Bridge.

128
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,041
(<i> fritzing beeps</i> )

129
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:53,875
Turbolift control, do you read?

130
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,750
This is the Captain.

131
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,625
Sir, over there!

132
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,792
Join me, Riker.

133
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:09,458
A good game needs
rules and planning.

134
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,750
Wasn't it your own Hartley
who said

135
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,208
"Nothing reveals humanity
so well as the games it plays"?

136
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,917
Almost right.

137
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:22,333
Actually, you reveal yourselves
best in how you play.

138
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:28,583
Sir, what he has in mind
might provide us

139
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,458
with vital information.

140
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,709
Ahh...

141
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,959
Incredible.

142
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,041
I was just thinking
about an old-fashioned lemonade.

143
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,709
And so it became that.

144
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,709
An excellent
thirst quencher.

145
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:11,750
Gets rather hot out
here on this plain.

146
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,417
What about my people?

147
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:16,291
Whatever they'd like,
of course.

148
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,125
(<i> glass breaks</i> )

149
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,333
"Drink not
with thine enemy."

150
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,792
The rigid Klingon code.

151
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,125
Explains something of
why you defeated them.

152
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,250
You're still fascinated
with the human past?

153
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,375
Perhaps you're not
that original.

154
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,625
<i>Au contraire!</i>

155
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,333
It's the human future
which intrigues us

156
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,542
and it should concern
you the most.

157
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,917
You see, of all
the species

158
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:59,041
yours cannot
abide stagnation.

159
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,291
Change is at the heart
of what you are.

160
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,458
But change into what?

161
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,959
That's the question.

162
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,333
That is what humans
call a truism.

163
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,542
You mean,
hardly original?

164
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,083
You're the one
who said it.

165
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,208
While we're at it

166
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,834
this isn't part
of any human future.

167
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:17,834
True.

168
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:18,917
I borrowed this

169
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,000
from your stodgy
Captain's mind.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,041
This is the dressing
for a game that we will play.

171
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,041
Now, games require rules
and rewards

172
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,333
and dangers and familiar
settings, that sort of thing.

173
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,000
This isn't that familiar to me.

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,333
Data?

175
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,500
This is from Europe's
Napoleonic era, sir--

176
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,208
late 18th,
early 19th centuries.

177
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,083
This is a campaign
headquarters tent.

178
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,750
His uniform is that

179
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,166
of a French
army marshal.

180
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,583
And a marshal outranks
even an admiral.

181
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,750
Well, you think I would go
from a Starfleet admiral

182
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,458
to anything else?

183
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,583
Of course you wouldn't.

184
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,250
But Napoleonic equipment
on an alien planet?

185
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,291
One so different
it has twin moons?

186
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,792
Well, as you've said, I'm
nothing if not imaginative

187
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,208
and the game
should reflect that.

188
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,959
Shall it be a test of strength?

189
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,667
Meaningless,
since you have none.

190
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,291
A test of intelligence, then?

191
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,458
Equally as meaningless.

192
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,208
But it needs risk!

193
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,000
Something to win...

194
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,583
and something to lose.

195
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:23,542
If we must play a game,
what would we win?

196
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:26,750
The greatest possible future
that you could imagine

197
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,333
which of course requires
something totally disastrous

198
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,834
if you're to lose.

199
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,542
Now, the point of
this game shall be

200
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:36,417
can any of you stay alive?

201
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:39,417
If your game is fair, we will.

202
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh, for shame, Worf!

203
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,917
Fairness is such
a human concept.

204
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,417
Think imaginatively.

205
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:49,959
This game shall, in fact,
be completely unfair.

206
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,208
You've gone too far.

207
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,291
Game penalty!

208
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,041
Where is she, Q?

209
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,166
You can forget your game...

210
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,166
To use a 20th century term

211
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,667
she's in a penalty box

212
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:05,542
where she will
remain unharmed

213
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,417
unless one of you
merits a penalty.

214
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:10,125
Unfortunately,
there's only one penalty box.

215
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,166
If any of you
should be sent there

216
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,542
dear Tasha must give the box up
to you.

217
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:16,709
And where does she go?

218
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:19,709
Into nothingness.

219
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,792
I entreat you to carefully
obey the rules of the game.

220
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:26,166
The only one who can destroy
your Tasha now

221
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,083
is you.

222
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,083
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

223
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,792
Captain's Log...

224
00:12:56,792 --> 00:13:00,458
(<i> voice slows and fades):</i>
Captain's... Log...

225
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,542
Damn it!

226
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:04,000
I can't even
make a log entry.

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,291
I wish I could
help you, Captain.

228
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:11,625
Where is everyone else?

229
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,166
Down on some planet.

230
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,291
Some planet?

231
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,291
What are you doing here?

232
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,375
Well, I, uh... uh...

233
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,083
It sounds strange...

234
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,333
but I'm in a penalty box.

235
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,375
A penalty box?

236
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,458
Q's penalty box.

237
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,792
It sounds strange

238
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:32,959
but it definitely isn't.

239
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,917
I know that one more penalty

240
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,333
by anyone

241
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,208
and I'm gone.

242
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,375
Gone?

243
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,834
Yes, I am gone!

244
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:45,542
(<i> crying softly</i> )

245
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:48,208
It is so
frustrating

246
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,792
to be controlled
like this.

247
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,208
Lieutenant...

248
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,333
Tasha...

249
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,792
it's all right.

250
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:01,667
What in the hell
am I doing?

251
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,500
Crying?

252
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,417
Don't worry.

253
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:11,417
There is a new ship's
standing order on the Bridge.

254
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:16,500
When one is in the
penalty box, tears
are permitted.

255
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,375
(<i> laughing</i> )

256
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,375
Captain...

257
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,125
Oh, if you weren't a Captain...

258
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,417
Q:
Consorting with lower rank
females, Captain?

259
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:32,417
Especially ones
in penalty boxes?

260
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,917
Destructive to discipline,
they say.

261
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,792
But then again,
you're what?

262
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,750
You're only human.

263
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,041
Penalty...

264
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,250
over.

265
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,709
A marshal of France?

266
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:58,000
Ridiculous!

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,166
Well, one takes
the jobs he can get.

268
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,458
For example,
Starlog entries.

269
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,750
Stardate today.

270
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,792
This is
Q speaking

271
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,083
for Captain Jean-Luc Picard

272
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,917
whom we consider to be too bound

273
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:15,750
by Starfleet customs
and traditions

274
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,500
to be useful to us.

275
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,959
The<i> Enterprise</i>
is now helpless

276
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,333
stuck like an Earth insect
in amber

277
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,792
while its bridge crew
plays out a game

278
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:27,667
whose real intent is to test

279
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,375
whether the first officer
is worthy

280
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,125
of the greatest gift
the Q can offer.

281
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:37,166
So you're taking
on Riker this time.

282
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,583
Excellent.

283
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,417
He'll defeat you
just as I did.

284
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:43,083
Shall we wager
on that, Captain?

285
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,417
Your starship command
against...

286
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,500
Against your keeping
out of humanity's path...

287
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,542
forever!

288
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:50,542
Done?

289
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:51,625
Done!

290
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,333
And you've already lost, Picard.

291
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:57,792
Riker will be offered
something impossible to refuse.

292
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,792
Geordi,
can you see Worf?

293
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,750
I'd see the freckles
on his nose

294
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,375
if he had them, sir.

295
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,166
He's at the third ridge.

296
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,458
The third ridge?

297
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,208
Mmm-hmm.
Moving well, too.

298
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,500
Uh, oh.

299
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,667
Good, he sees them.

300
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,458
(<i> snarling and snorting</i> )

301
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,125
Listen to me, Q.

302
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,041
You seem to have
some need for humans.

303
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,709
Mmm... Concern
regarding them.

304
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,208
Well, whatever it is

305
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,291
why do you demonstrate it
through this confrontation?

306
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,583
Why not a simple,
direct explanation--

307
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,625
a statement
of what you seek?

308
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,333
Why these games?

309
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,542
Why these games?

310
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,166
Well, the play is the thing.

311
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,792
And I'm surprised
you have to ask

312
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,291
when your human Shakespeare
explained it all so well.

313
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,458
So he did, but don't
depend too much

314
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,125
on any one single viewpoint...

315
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,792
It's a pity you don't
know the content of
your own library.

316
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:36,792
Hear this, Picard
and reflect:

317
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:40,417
"All the galaxy's a stage..."

318
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:43,625
World, not galaxy--
"all the world's a stage."

319
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,333
Oh, you know that one.

320
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,583
Well, if he were living now
he would have said galaxy.

321
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,625
How about this, uh...

322
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,375
"Life is but a walking shadow.

323
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,750
"A poor player that struts

324
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,375
"and frets
his hour upon the stage

325
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,166
"and then is heard no more.

326
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,208
"It is a tale
told by an idiot

327
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,458
"full of sound
and fury

328
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,667
signifying
nothing."

329
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,291
I see.

330
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,291
So how we respond to a game
tells you more about us

331
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,750
than our real life--

332
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,250
this "tale told
by an idiot".

333
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,542
Interesting, Q.

334
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:19,542
Oh, thank you very much.

335
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:20,625
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

336
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,792
Perhaps maybe
a little<i> Hamlet?</i>

337
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:24,291
Oh, no, I know<i> Hamlet.</i>

338
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,333
And what he might say
with irony

339
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,959
I say with conviction.

340
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:30,583
"What a piece of work is man!

341
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,375
"How noble in reason.

342
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,458
"How infinite in faculty.

343
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,208
"In form,
in moving

344
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,959
"how express
and admirable.

345
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:40,417
"In action,
how like an angel.

346
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:41,542
"In apprehension

347
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,709
how like
a god."

348
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:46,625
Surely you don't see your
species like that, do you?

349
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,542
I see us
one day becoming that, Q.

350
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,291
Is it that
which concerns you?

351
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:03,333
Those soldiers have formed
a skirmishing line

352
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,333
I think
you'd call it.

353
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,583
And they're
headed this way.

354
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,583
Armed with ancient
ball-and-powder muskets?

355
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,041
That's what their weapons
look like, sir.

356
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,542
Muskets are
appropriate

357
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,750
to the 1790-1800
French army uniform, sir

358
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,125
but it is
hardly a weapon

359
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,125
by our standards.

360
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,083
A lead ball

361
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,417
propelled
by gunpowder.

362
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,625
100 meters at best
with any accuracy.

363
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,083
Yeah, but against phasers?

364
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,583
Just one
of our hand phasers

365
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,500
could finish off
an entire regiment.

366
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,166
Except for one thing.

367
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,709
That hardly sounds
like Q--

368
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:34,458
to give us an advantage
like that.

369
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,583
Unless...

370
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,083
Drop your weapons!

371
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,417
I'm afraid
that was me, Worf.

372
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:50,041
I was checking to see if
the phasers still operate.

373
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
Incredible, Worf!

374
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,291
You came
out of nowhere.

375
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,917
A warrior's reaction.

376
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:57,959
Report.

377
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,500
What did you find?

378
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,417
Sir, what they're wearing
may be old Earth uniforms

379
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,583
but what's inside
of them isn't human at all--

380
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,458
more like vicious animal things.

381
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:13,542
(<i> snorting and snarling</i> )

382
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:16,417
Those soldiers
are moving in fast, sir.

383
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,959
Data, if you've got a theory

384
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,125
about what's
happening...

385
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,250
Think fast, Commander Riker.

386
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,917
And move fast.

387
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:34,917
(<i> phaser blast</i> )

388
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,083
(<i> phaser blast</i> )

389
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,000
Those aren't muskets!

390
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,834
Q:
You have only one chance
to save them now.

391
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,333
Send them back
to the ship.

392
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,083
You'll let me
beam them?

393
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,166
Send them the same way I do.

394
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,583
I've given you the power.

395
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,500
Do you understand?
I have given you

396
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,583
the power of the Q.

397
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:05,834
Use it.

398
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,667
(<i> enemy phaser blast</i> )

399
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,917
Q:
<i>Use your power.</i>

400
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:21,709
<i>Use your power.</i>

401
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:58,917
Lieutenant,
take the conn position.

402
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,041
Engineering, this is the Bridge.

403
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,333
Engineering here, sir.

404
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,208
Engineering, are all
systems back on line?

405
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,166
Back on line, sir?
They were never off.

406
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,959
Captain, you'd
better look at this.

407
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:15,166
There's been no interruption
in course or speed.

408
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,458
Both have
remained constant.

409
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,458
It's as though
we never stopped.

410
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,000
We never did,
Lieutenant.

411
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,500
Q suspended time.

412
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,250
Where's Commander Riker?

413
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,250
He<i> was</i> with us.

414
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,041
GEORDI:
He must still be
on the planet.

415
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,333
We were under
attack by these...

416
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,208
these animal things.

417
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,959
Animal things?

418
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:47,542
Well, maybe Data could
explain it better, sir.

419
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:49,208
You may find it

420
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,625
aesthetically
displeasing, sir.

421
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,667
I could just file
a computer report on that.

422
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:53,792
Data!

423
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,125
Sir, the important
thing right now is

424
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,250
why is Commander
Riker missing?

425
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,041
Understood, Lieutenant.

426
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:01,125
But I suspect that
Commander Riker is
probably perfectly safe

427
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,333
at least in a
physical sense.

428
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:06,834
Q has an interest
in him.

429
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,709
In fact,
Q's entire visit

430
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:10,917
has something to do
with our first officer.

431
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,500
And the reason
for that, sir?

432
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,125
I wish
I knew.

433
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,333
Q first became interested
in him at Farpoint.

434
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,875
I have no idea
what it means.

435
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:23,041
Meanwhile, we must proceed
with our rescue mission.

436
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,166
(<i> Riker laughing heartily</i> )

437
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,583
Something
amuses you?

438
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,291
Perhaps you'll share
the joke with me?

439
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,208
The joke is you.

440
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:52,959
Strange gratitude from one
who has been granted a gift

441
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:55,083
beyond any human dream.

442
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:00,000
How can you
not appreciate

443
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,667
being able to
send your friends

444
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,041
back to their ship?

445
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,375
Or send the soldiers back
to the nothingness

446
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,208
from which they came?

447
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:10,041
Certainly you must understand
that at this moment

448
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,417
you can send yourself
back to the ship

449
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,917
or to Earth, or
change your shape

450
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:16,458
and become anything
you want to be.

451
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,667
What do you need, Q?
Need?

452
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,542
You want something
from us, desperately.
What is it?

453
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:25,709
Want something
from you foolish,
fragile non-entities?

454
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:28,458
Oh, come, Riker--
you're beginning

455
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,125
to sound like
your Captain.

456
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:33,834
Now, that's a compliment, Q,
but that's not an answer.

457
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,875
Riker, we have offered you
a gift beyond all other gifts.

458
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,875
Out of the goodness
of your heart?

459
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:56,458
After Farpoint, I returned
to where we exist--

460
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,375
the Q continuum.

461
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,208
Which means exactly what?

462
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:04,166
The limitless dimensions
of the galaxy in which we exist.

463
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,500
I don't understand.

464
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,458
Of course
you don't

465
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,000
and you never will

466
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,500
until you become one of us.

467
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,125
"Until"? Would you mind
going over that again?

468
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:17,542
Well, if you'd stop
interrupting me...

469
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:20,333
I mean, this is hardly a time
to be teaching you

470
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:24,250
the true nature of the universe.

471
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,083
However...

472
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:32,208
at Farpoint,
we saw you as savages only.

473
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,625
We discovered
instead

474
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:36,625
that you are
unusual creatures

475
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:40,709
in your own limited ways--

476
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:44,417
ways which, in time,
will not be so limited.

477
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,083
We're growing?

478
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:51,083
Something about us compels
us to learn, explore.

479
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,000
Yes, the human compulsion.

480
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,041
And unfortunately for us, it is
a power which will grow stronger

481
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,417
century after century

482
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:58,959
eon after eon.

483
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:01,000
Eons.

484
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,250
Have you any idea
how far we'll advance?

485
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,625
Perhaps in the future
that you cannot yet conceive

486
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,667
even beyond us.

487
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:12,417
So, you see,
we must know more

488
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,291
about this human
compulsion.

489
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:17,750
That's why we've selected you,
Riker, to become part of the Q.

490
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,542
So that you can bring to us
this human need and hunger

491
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:24,000
that we may better
understand it.

492
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,041
I suppose that's meant
as a compliment, Q.

493
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:31,166
Or maybe it's my limited mind.

494
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,792
But to become a part of you...?

495
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,000
I don't even like you!

496
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,709
You're going to miss me.

497
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:54,250
Come on, not again!

498
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:04,959
Commander Riker,
what's going on?

499
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,000
I was sitting
in school and...

500
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,208
TASHA:
Worf!

501
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,208
My phaser's gone.

502
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,291
Are you armed?

503
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,417
No.

504
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,291
Where is Q?

505
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:19,542
If you have an answer

506
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:20,625
to any
of this...

507
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:23,834
(<i> trumpet sounds "advance"</i> )

508
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,458
(<i> drumming</i> )

509
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,709
Worf!

510
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:53,625
Worf!

511
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:54,875
RIKER:
Look out!

512
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,625
PICARD:
Wesley, no!
Wesley!

513
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,000
Wesley!

514
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
RIKER:
No, damn it!

515
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,875
Damn it to hell!

516
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,417
Riker!

517
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:08,959
You...

518
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,542
<i>you</i> did that.

519
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:13,291
And that's not all.

520
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:33,083
That grid,
their wounds...

521
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,875
only the Q
can do that.

522
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:48,500
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41591.4:</i>

<i>12 minutes out</i>

00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,041
How the hell
do I advise you?

532
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:20,750
You know the
implications
as well as I.

533
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,834
No one has ever offered to
turn me into a god before.

534
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:26,875
What the Q has offered you

535
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,083
has got to be close
to immortality, Will.

536
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,208
They're not lying

537
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,333
about controlling
time and space.

538
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,083
We've seen it in
what they can do.

539
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:36,333
You've also seen it
in what I can do.

540
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,625
If you're going
to refuse his offer

541
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:41,458
you must not allow yourself
to use this power again.

542
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:43,208
It's too great
a temptation for us

543
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,208
at our present stage
of development.

544
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,667
Are you worried that I won't
be able to say no to it?

545
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:49,792
You tell me.

546
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:53,583
Are you strong enough to refuse
to use that power?

547
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,792
Certainly!

548
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,417
No matter how tempted?

549
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:58,750
No matter how difficult
Q makes it for you?

550
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,625
You have my word.

551
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,000
Good.

552
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,208
I know what
your word means.

553
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,583
DATA:
In orbit
of Quadra Sigma III, sir.

554
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:12,291
Ready to beam down rescue team
to underground emergency area.

555
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,500
This way, sir.

556
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:39,583
(<i> coughing and moaning</i> )

557
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,083
Are there any others?

558
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,625
Gone.

559
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,458
It's just us.

560
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,667
Commander!

561
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,583
There's somebody
under here.

562
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:20,709
GEORDI:
You're getting
close, Data

563
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:39,417
It's too late...

564
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:41,625
she's dead.

565
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,959
If only we'd gotten
here a little sooner.

566
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:51,917
Sir, if indeed you have
the power of Q...

567
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:56,792
I don't understand.

568
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:59,500
Certainly you can't
bring her back to life?

569
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,709
I can't.

570
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:04,750
I'm prevented from that
by a promise.

571
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,375
I should have never have made
that agreement with you.

572
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:35,041
I could have saved
that child.

573
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,875
You were right not to try.

574
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,875
Once you became accustomed
to that power, Number One...

575
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,083
When I used
it before

576
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,125
what happened?

577
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,583
I saved most of our Bridge crew.

578
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:46,333
And when you grow
to like it too much?

579
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,625
As soon as
it's convenient, Captain

580
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:52,500
I want a meeting with you
and your Bridge staff.

581
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,458
As soon as we are secure
of this rescue operation

582
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:56,792
I'll discuss all

583
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:58,667
that this
new power...

584
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:26,500
We can confer here
on the Bridge

585
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
if no one has
any objections.

586
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,875
The Bridge
will be fine

587
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,750
since I've called
the entire staff.

588
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,625
Correction, Number One--

589
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,166
knowing the decision you face

590
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:36,917
I've permitted you
this gathering.

591
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:38,875
Of course, Jean-Luc.

592
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,333
Wesley

593
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,208
this meeting
is not for you.

594
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,583
Why not, sir?

595
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,750
You helped make me
a Bridge officer...

596
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:56,750
acting ensign.

597
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,792
All right, he stays.

598
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,667
Because I've been
given unusual powers

599
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:12,458
I'm not suddenly a monster.

600
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,709
Except for these abilities--

601
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:17,417
and I don't yet know
how far they go--

602
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:20,500
I'm the same William T. Riker
you've always known.

603
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,083
Well?

604
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:32,542
Everyone
still looks uncomfortable.

605
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:35,417
Perhaps they're all remembering
that old saying

606
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:37,125
"power corrupts...

607
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:40,500
...and absolute power
corrupts absolutely."

608
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,166
Do you believe I haven't
thought of that, Jean-Luc?

609
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:48,500
And have you noticed how you and
I are now on a first name basis?

610
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,250
Number one...

611
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,333
Will...

612
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,542
something has happened already.

613
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:58,542
In what way?

614
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:00,959
Haven't you seen
how much I regretted

615
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:02,208
not saving that child?

616
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:05,083
Using the power
of Q to save her

617
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,542
may not have been wrong.

618
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:08,709
No more than it was wrong
to save the rest of you

619
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:10,792
from those
soldier things.

620
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:13,667
Let's keep in mind that
that particular danger

621
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,625
was invented by Q.

622
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:18,250
TASHA:
What we represent
to the Q, Commander

623
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,542
are lowly animals,
tormented into performing

624
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:24,000
for their
amusement.

625
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,208
Actually, they think very highly
of us, Tasha.

626
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,500
We have
a quality

627
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,500
of growth
which they admire.

628
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,125
Or fear.

629
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:40,125
No, we've learned
the Q do not admire us.

630
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:43,125
The Q
has muddled your mind.

631
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:47,250
Don't you understand
his incredible gift to me?

632
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,333
Q:
Are these
truly

633
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,458
your friends,
brother?

634
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,959
Let us pray

635
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:11,166
for understanding
and for compassion.

636
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,667
Let us do no such damn thing!

637
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:16,166
What is this need of yours
for costumes, Q?

638
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,917
Have you no identity
of your own?

639
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:20,583
I come in search of the truth.

640
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,917
You come in search
of what humanity is!

641
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:26,250
I forgive your blasphemy!

642
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,208
Can't you see,
Riker?

643
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,417
He's nothing
but a flimflam man.

644
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:38,125
He's been that ever since
we met him at Farpoint.

645
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,375
Flimflam?

646
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,542
You offer Riker jealousy.

647
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:46,417
What I offer him is clearly
beyond your comprehension.

648
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:48,709
How can you claim friendship
for Riker

649
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:52,083
while obstructing his way
to the greatest adventure

650
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,291
ever offered
a human?

651
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:55,917
Obstructing him?

652
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,709
Then it's not yet certain?

653
00:36:57,709 --> 00:36:59,375
He's not yet
committed?

654
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:02,375
The truly evil part of all this,
Captain, is your jealousy.

655
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:05,625
You love each one
of your people.

656
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,542
Demonstrate it.

657
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:08,834
You have
the power

658
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:10,333
to leave
each of them

659
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,083
with a gift proving
your affection.

660
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:15,250
There'd be no harm, would there

661
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,208
if I gave them something
I know they'd like?

662
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,250
Oh, how touching.

663
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,125
A plea to his
former Captain.

664
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:27,792
"May I please give happiness
to my friends, sir?

665
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,500
Please, sir."

666
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:36,500
In fact, I authorize and support
your idea, Riker.

667
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,125
Please feel free to cooperate
with him, if you wish.

668
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,917
Are you certain, sir?

669
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:47,417
Quite certain,
Data.

670
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:51,250
By all means, demonstrate
your gifts of affection.

671
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,375
Don't be frightened.

672
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:58,166
There is no way
I could harm any of you.

673
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,917
Shall I guess
your dreams?

674
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,875
Leave now,
Wesley.

675
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:12,458
No, Wesley I may
know best of all.

676
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,583
Our friendship,
our long talks...

677
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,291
No, please.

678
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:19,625
Have your favorite wish,
my young friend.

679
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,291
RIKER:
You're ten years older--
a man.

680
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:34,000
Hey, Wes...

681
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,792
not bad.

682
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,542
Data.

683
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:42,792
No!

684
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:44,417
No, sir.

685
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,625
But it's what
you've always wanted, Data--

686
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:47,875
to become human.

687
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,542
DATA:
Yes, sir.
That is true.

688
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:57,333
But I never wanted to compound
one illusion with another.

689
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:00,917
It might be real to Q--

690
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:03,125
perhaps even
you, sir--

691
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:06,250
but it would never be so to me.

692
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,959
Was it not one of the Captain's
favorite authors who wrote

693
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:14,333
"this above all,
to thine own self be true"?

694
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:17,375
Sorry,
Commander.

695
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,291
I must decline.

696
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:27,291
And you, my friend...

697
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,709
I know what you want.

698
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:06,750
You're as beautiful
as I imagined.

699
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,834
And more.

700
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:13,000
Then we can
throw away the visor?

701
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:19,500
I don't
think so, sir.

702
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,291
The price is a little
too high for me

703
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:27,000
and I don't like who
I'd have to thank.

704
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:35,667
Make me the way I was.

705
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,166
Please!

706
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,041
RIKER:
Proud warrior Worf

707
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:04,542
without a single tie
to his own kind.

708
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:20,583
(<i> growls</i> )

709
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:30,583
(<i> growls</i> )

710
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:41,583
(<i> seductive growl</i> )

711
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:54,041
No!

712
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:58,875
She is from a world
now alien to me!

713
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:03,542
Worf, is this your idea of sex?

714
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:07,125
This is sex.

715
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:10,291
But I have no place for it
in my life now!

716
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,375
No place, micro brain?

717
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:13,417
What possesses you?

718
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:15,709
(<i> growling</i> )

719
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:22,625
Commander Riker,
it's too soon for this.

720
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:25,375
If this is because your mother
objects...

721
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:27,291
WESLEY:
No.

722
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:32,083
I just want
to get there
on my own.

723
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,917
Honest.

724
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:39,875
But it's easier, boy.

725
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:41,125
Listen
to Riker.

726
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,000
How did you know, sir?

727
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,333
I feel like such an idiot.

728
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,333
Quite right.

729
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,834
So you should.

730
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:01,375
It's all over, Q.

731
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:02,667
You have no further
business here.

732
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,750
Human, you have
just destroyed yourself.

733
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,834
Pay off
your wager.

734
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,041
I recall no wager!

735
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,917
I'm sure
your fellow Q remember

736
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:10,625
that you agreed
never to trouble
our species again.

737
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:12,250
Just as they're aware
that you failed

738
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,458
to tempt a human to join you.

739
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,709
No! No, if I could do
one more thing!

740
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:18,458
Q, I strongly suspect

741
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:20,834
there's some explaining
you have to do now.

742
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:24,417
No!

743
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:44,583
Extraordinary.

744
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:48,375
Captain, we are showing
that same hole in time again.

745
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,542
Our instruments
say we just now

746
00:43:50,542 --> 00:43:52,834
beamed back
from our rescue mission.

747
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:59,709
Sir, how is it that the Q can
handle time and space so well

748
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:01,583
and us so badly?

749
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,458
Perhaps some day
we will discover

750
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:08,083
that space and time are simpler
than the human equation.

751
00:44:11,834 --> 00:44:15,250
No coordinates
laid in, Number One?

752
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,834
Yes, sir.

753
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:19,333
You have my
coordinates,
La Forge?

754
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:21,000
Aye, sir.

755
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,792
On the board.

756
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,709
Engage.
