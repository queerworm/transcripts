00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:05,917
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41255.6:</i>

2
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:08,333
<i>After delivering a party</i>
<i>of Earth colonists</i>

3
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,125
<i>to the Strnad solar system,</i>

4
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,458
<i>we have discovered</i>
<i>another class M planet</i>

5
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:14,750
<i>in the adjoining</i>
<i>Rubicun star system.</i>

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,500
<i>We are now in orbit there</i>

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,250
<i>having determined it</i>
<i>to be inhabited</i>

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,375
<i>as well as unusually lovely.</i>

9
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,709
<i>My first officer has taken an</i>
<i>away team down to make contact</i>

10
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:26,625
<i>and they are in the process</i>
<i>of returning to the ship.</i>

11
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,583
Riker says
the planet's life-forms

12
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:29,917
are almost identical to us.

13
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:31,458
He's very enthusiastic.

14
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:34,000
Captain...
sorry, Troi.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,417
The Doctor has something very
important to tell you, Captain.

16
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:39,333
You've been talking
about it for days--

17
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,208
shore leave for the crew.

18
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,500
Establishing this colony
has been exhausting

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,083
for the entire
crew, Captain.

20
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,834
We're not a supply vessel.

21
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:50,709
Settling all those people
has been a strain on everyone.

22
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,834
I'm tired myself.

23
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:58,291
Is it as good as your
report suggests, Number One?

24
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,750
As per report, sir.

25
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,583
Class M--
earthlike, beautiful.

26
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,250
It will startle you.

27
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,667
Sounds wonderful
for the children.

28
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,792
The holodecks are
marvelous, of course,

29
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,041
but there's nothing
like open spaces

30
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,875
and fresh air.

31
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:15,709
I've listed my report on
their customs and laws, sir.

32
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,750
Fairly simple--
common sense things.

33
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,166
LA FORGE:
They're wild in some ways

34
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,667
actually puritanical
in others.

35
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:22,917
Neat as pins, ultra-lawful.

36
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,667
They make love
at the drop of a hat.

37
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,792
Any hat.

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,875
But the happiest report
has its negatives.

39
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,542
Let's start with them,
Number One.

40
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:36,875
There are none, sir--
none that any of us could find.

41
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,875
But there is
a problem here, sir.

42
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,959
It's the faulty reading
I reported, sir.

43
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,500
I'm reading something
off the starboard bow

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,291
but there is
nothing there.

45
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,917
Sensor technicians
are working on it, sir.

46
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:53,458
They have identified it
as a glitch in the system.

47
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:59,208
I take it you find no glitch
at all in this planet, however.

48
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,041
No, sir.

49
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,667
If you approve
shore leave, sir,

50
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,458
we could start
with a small group.

51
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,875
Of course.

52
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,166
Wesley, if we go down,

53
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,333
I'd like you
to join the away team

54
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,959
to evaluate this planet

55
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,834
as a place for young
people to relax.

56
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,750
Yes, sir.

57
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,417
If our scans and observations
confirm the report,

58
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:20,542
of course I'll approve it.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,291
Let's just hope it's not
too good to be true.

60
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:52,041
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

61
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:56,417
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

62
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

63
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,792
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

64
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:06,500
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

65
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,375
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

66
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:15,583
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Supplemental:</i>

67
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,542
<i>We are in orbit of a planet</i>
<i>designated Rubicun 3</i>

68
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:22,041
<i>the home of a life-form</i>
<i>who call themselves the Edo.</i>

69
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,917
<i>Our away team,</i>
<i>including Wesley Crusher,</i>

70
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:26,959
<i>has beamed down to</i>
<i>make some arrangements</i>

71
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,291
<i>concerning some</i>
<i>well-earned recreation.</i>

72
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,583
Careful, sir.
No, it's all right, Lieutenant.

73
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,625
Those are the Edo
we met before.

74
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,208
They certainly are fit.

75
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,583
They certainly are.

76
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,917
Health and happiness!

77
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,083
A pleasant day to you!

78
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,041
You did return as promised.

79
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,125
Rivan, Liator.

80
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,333
Also from our vessel,
Troi and...

81
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,667
Slowly, slowly.

82
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,500
I must welcome
this lovely one.

83
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,959
Nice to see you again.

84
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,333
My pleasure.

85
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,625
RIKER:
Counselor?

86
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,458
Healthy sensuality, sir.

87
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,166
I feel mainly friendship
and, um...

88
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,542
happiness.

89
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,250
And I welcome this huge one.

90
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,834
Oh, yes!

91
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,959
Nice planet.

92
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,709
Yeah.

93
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,375
But you are a young one.

94
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,834
I do not know your custom
regarding love.

95
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,917
Uh...

96
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,625
I guess...

97
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,542
whatever you usually do.

98
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:28,667
There are others
who would like to visit here

99
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,166
if you would give us
a limit on the number.

100
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,375
Whatever pleases you.

101
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,834
We'll discuss it
at the council chambers.

102
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:36,709
Shall we go there now
or remain and play?

103
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,625
Play?

104
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,959
At love.

105
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,959
Unless you don't enjoy that.

106
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,583
Perhaps<i> you</i> do.

107
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,458
And you.

108
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,333
Yes, I can see that you do.

109
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,625
Maybe I should just
go on ahead.

110
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,458
Oh, this is unfair to him.

111
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,959
We'll go on to
the council chambers.

112
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,000
You'll find young people
your age there.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,500
Well, I can't
make any promises.

114
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
You don't have to.

115
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,792
Our rules are simple.

116
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:20,125
No one does anything
uncomfortable to them.

117
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,875
Come, our people will
want to know you.

118
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,291
Rivan, perhaps
they can't run.

119
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,375
Can't run?

120
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,959
Of course we can run.
Right, Commander?

121
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,041
That's the custom here--
running.

122
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,667
Lead the way.

123
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,375
When in Rome, eh?

124
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,041
When in where, sir?

125
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:56,125
Good health to you!

126
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,291
Happiness to you!

127
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,083
It's like an Eden here.

128
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,250
Good health!

129
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,917
I thought you might be
out of breath.

130
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:18,417
We may surprise you
in a lot of ways.

131
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:21,375
Children, we've brought
you a new friend.

132
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,875
Well, hello!
Join us.

133
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,208
Yes, please.

134
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,250
Come on!

135
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,458
This way.

136
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,959
And now it's time for you
to meet some new friends.

137
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,250
Everyone!

138
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,000
We've brought
the visitors.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,875
Please, enjoy what we have.

140
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,792
Come with me.

141
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,250
I've traced it through
our sensor channels, sir.

142
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,000
It's not a glitch or any other
form of error or malfunction.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,792
That's confirmed
by my readings, Captain.

144
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:41,083
It's a shadow something.

145
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,458
Exactly, as if it were neither
in or out of our dimension.

146
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,041
What is, Commander?

147
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,500
Whatever is sitting
out there

148
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,166
without triggering
our alarm relays, sir.

149
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,417
Center main viewer
on that area.

150
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,583
I see nothing, Commander.

151
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,792
<i>Enterprise</i> to object
off our starboard bow.

152
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,166
Request that you
identify yourself.

153
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,208
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

154
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,166
Shields and deflectors
up full, sir.

155
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,917
Main phaser banks ready.

156
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,917
Hailing frequencies--
any reply?

157
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:33,625
It was something
unintelligible, sir.

158
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,625
Now running it through
language and logic circuits.

159
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,709
Geordi?
Sir?

160
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,834
Have a real look.
Aye, sir.

161
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:43,667
Sir, my sensors read it...
well, as half there.

162
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:46,792
And it does look as if
it were partly transparent.

163
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,458
Data, what the hell is it?

164
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,834
Lieutenant La Forge
to Captain.

165
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,208
Go ahead, La Forge.
What can you make out?

166
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,000
This is something
I've never seen before, sir.

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,709
After complete spectral
analysis, it's...

168
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:20,041
well, it's as if
it's not really there.

169
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,041
I don't understand it.

170
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,291
I've got some information
on its first transmission, sir.

171
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:29,166
It translates as "stand by."

172
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,500
Sir, I see something
coming out of that ship.

173
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,333
Verified, sir.

174
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,375
Something very small.

175
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,583
What is it?

176
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:52,625
Intruder alert, sir.

177
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,875
I don't show
a location.

178
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,083
The away team signal
has been cut off, Captain.

179
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,041
We've lost contact
with our people.

180
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,000
Intruder relays
do show something.

181
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,834
Why has everything become
a "something" or a "whatever"?

182
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:27,291
MALE VOICE:
State... the... purpose.

183
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,125
State the purpose
of what you have done.

184
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm Captain Picard

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,542
commanding this
Federation starship.

186
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:51,208
State the purpose
of your visit here.

187
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:56,583
We have sent down
what we call an away team

188
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,625
to make peaceful contact here.

189
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:04,000
Do you plan to leave
life-forms here?

190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,041
No.

191
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,750
We are merely visiting here.

192
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,792
But you did more at the world
you just left.

193
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,667
Why have you left
your own life-forms there?

194
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:19,500
The colony we
just planted, sir.

195
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,041
We found that world
uninhabited.

196
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,250
The life-forms
we left there had...

197
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,333
had sought the challenge--

198
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,500
at least, that is
the basic reason--

199
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,792
had sought the challenge

200
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:36,792
of creating a new lifestyle--

201
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,875
a new society there.

202
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,625
Life on our world
is driven

203
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,709
to protect itself

204
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:46,500
by seeding itself
as widely as possible.

205
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,166
Do not interfere

206
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,667
with my children below.

207
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,417
Captain...

208
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:03,500
I do not
understand how

209
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,041
but it is asking me
if I was constructed

210
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,500
for information exchange.

211
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,417
If there is any way
of finding out

212
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,709
whatever it is
out there, Data...

213
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,583
Watch! I bet you
can't do this!

214
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,250
Watch this.

215
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,333
I want to do something,
too, with you.

216
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,625
Uh, what?

217
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,083
It's something you can
teach me. Will you?

218
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:07,166
Uh... well, actually,

219
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,125
there are some games
I don't quite know yet.

220
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,750
It's playing ball.

221
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,834
Will you teach me?

222
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,750
Oh, sure.

223
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,166
If you have a bat
for the ball,

224
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,834
I can show you
my favorite.

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,834
A bat?

226
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,667
A stick or a branch.

227
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,875
Um, about this long,
this thick.

228
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,417
We can get it in the gardens.
Come on!

229
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,917
This will please you.
Join us.

230
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:55,083
Thanks, another time.

231
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,208
Joy and happiness.

232
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,709
It certainly is.

233
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,250
The good life, Worf.

234
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,750
I am not concerned
with pleasure, Commander.

235
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,083
I am a warrior.

236
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,500
Even Klingons need
love now and then.

237
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,875
For what we consider love, sir,
I would need a Klingon woman.

238
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,041
What about plain old basic sex?

239
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,709
You must have
some need for that.

240
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:27,917
Of course, but with the females
available to me, sir--

241
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,625
Earth females--

242
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,417
I must restrain myself
too much.

243
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,792
They are quite fragile, sir.

244
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:37,041
Worf, if anyone else
had said that,

245
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,208
I'd suspect
he was bragging.

246
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,625
Bragging, sir?

247
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,000
I think I'll
pass on that.

248
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,834
I better check in.

249
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:48,333
<i>Enterprise,</i> come in.

250
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,583
Captain, do you read me?

251
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,709
Let's...

252
00:16:57,709 --> 00:16:59,583
This may be nothing,

253
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,291
but let's move
all our people together.

254
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,458
Including Wesley, the boy?

255
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,417
He's outside.

256
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,375
Is there a problem?

257
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,834
We've lost contact
with our ship.

258
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,792
Well, it's nothing
these people have done.

259
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,709
I'm certain of that.

260
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,208
Their minds are so open.

261
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,250
Help me locate Wes.
He's wandered off.

262
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,750
That is extraordinary.

263
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,667
May I take a moment of
your time, Lieutenant?

264
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:40,208
Yes, Worf, but you've got
to hear this.

265
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,750
Are you telling me that there's
no crime here whatsoever?

266
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,166
No one breaks
any laws?

267
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,542
Once they did.

268
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:51,083
Long, long ago,
there was much disorder.

269
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,500
But not now.

270
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,250
But I've seen no sign
of police.

271
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,166
Those who enforce laws.

272
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,250
RIVAN:
Oh, we have very few.

273
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,709
They are called mediators

274
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,959
and they are needed only
in one place each day.

275
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,500
The punishment zone,

276
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,000
an area that's selected
for a period of time.

277
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,083
It's a completely
random selection?

278
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,417
No one but our mediators
know what place

279
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,041
or for how long.

280
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,750
We're very proud of
the wisdom of our ancestors.

281
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,875
No person ever knows where
or when a zone will be.

282
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,959
And so no one
risks death.

283
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,625
Death?

284
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,208
By breaking any law.

285
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,959
Wait, explain this.

286
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,875
Only one punishment
for any crime.

287
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,250
Anyone who commits any crime
in the punishment zone dies?

288
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,250
The law is the law.

289
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,041
Our peace is built on that.

290
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,750
Even a small thing...

291
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,083
such as ignoring the rule
"keep off the grass"?

292
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,500
Well, then,
no one breaks that rule.

293
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,834
Who wants to risk execution?

294
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,792
And there's always
a white wall or fence

295
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:56,875
to remind anyone
of a forbidden area like that.

296
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,917
And just who tells visitors
about these rules?

297
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:02,792
We'd better find Wesley.

298
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,166
(<i> laughing</i> )

299
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,542
Here.

300
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,500
Catch, catch.

301
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,125
All right. Over here.

302
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,458
Yeah!

303
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,625
Throw it back.

304
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,375
All right. Oh, good catch.

305
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,458
Here it comes.

306
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,875
Right here.

307
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,750
There you go.

308
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,959
Hey!

309
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,834
Here it comes.

310
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,834
You're very
clever at this.

311
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,500
At home, we play a lot of it.

312
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,291
Here, toss the ball
ahead of me.

313
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,083
No, Wes!

314
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,542
No, it's forbidden
to disturb new plants.

315
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,041
Couldn't you
see the fence?

316
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,250
It's for new plants.

317
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,875
Don't ever past
a white marker.

318
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,291
It's okay.

319
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,166
I'm fine.

320
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,041
Oh, no!

321
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, please, no!

322
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:24,917
Speak the truth.

323
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:27,208
We are mediators.

324
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,709
I said I was fine.

325
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,291
He doesn't know!
He's from another place!

326
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:35,208
How very sad, but this zone
has been selected.

327
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,041
But he doesn't understand.

328
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,792
It's always sad.

329
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:41,208
Now doubly so.

330
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,041
I was chasing
a ball

331
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,333
and I fell into that.

332
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,834
I'm really sorry.

333
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,667
You admit you
did that?

334
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,792
Freely?

335
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:55,834
I'm with Starfleet.

336
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,583
We don't lie.

337
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,625
It won't happen again.

338
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,959
We apologize.

339
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,917
We're sorry, too,

340
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:06,917
but that
changes nothing.

341
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,000
Careful, Commander.

342
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,583
They've got some
strange laws here.

343
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,208
I thought you
reviewed their laws.

344
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,375
But they listed nothing
about punishment.

345
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,625
One moment, please.

346
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,834
Is there a witness
to this transgression?

347
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,625
But it was my fault.

348
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,917
<i>I</i> threw
the ball past him.

349
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:25,875
We have a visible
transgression

350
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,625
ample witnesses

351
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,250
and an admission
of guilt.

352
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,917
And though it pains
us deeply to do it, we must.

353
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,083
Are you prepared
for punishment?

354
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,583
Punishment?

355
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,000
If you mean what the others
were talking about...

356
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,166
What punishment? Name it.

357
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,375
Death, of course.

358
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,750
Don't make it
difficult for the boy.

359
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:54,667
Drop it!

360
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,875
Drop it now!

361
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,625
It's a kind of syringe.

362
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,917
What is this?

363
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,500
You said death.
Is this poison?

364
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,375
But... but of course it is--
completely painless.

365
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,417
The boy would have
felt nothing.

366
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:21,041
But look at him now.

367
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,000
You frightened him.

368
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,208
He was going to kill me?

369
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,583
And if this zone
was still in effect,

370
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,041
you would all deserve death.

371
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,500
It was announced
you came as friends.

372
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,667
Is this how
friends act?

373
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,291
<i>Enterprise</i> from away team.

374
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,125
Come in.

375
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,166
Are you receiving us,
<i>Enterprise?</i>

376
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,917
Condition?

377
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:03,166
No sign of
consciousness

378
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,667
but the balance
of the readings

379
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,291
are quite normal
for him.

380
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:09,166
I believe this is some form
of information exchange

381
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,458
with whatever is over there.

382
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,959
At least, I hope it is.

383
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,166
Any communication
from the away team?

384
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:18,500
Something is blocking
communication both...

385
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:25,333
YAR:
Security, urgent.

386
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,083
Repeating,
<i>Enterprise</i> from away team.

387
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,250
This is the<i> Enterprise,</i> 
Lieutenant.

388
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,583
We're receiving you now.

389
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,458
This is an urgent call
for Captain Picard.

390
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,333
RIKER:
We may need your presence
here, Captain.

391
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:38,667
We have serious trouble
with a member of our away team

392
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,750
and an unusual law
they have here.

393
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,417
Captain to Riker. Stand by.

394
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:45,041
Any signs of consciousness?

395
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,208
Not yet.

396
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,458
It could be
minutes or hours.

397
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,208
It's unclear what's
happened to him.

398
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,375
Take him to Sick Bay, let me
know the instant he's awake.

399
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,500
Anything new on
that thing over there?

400
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,458
Negative, sir.

401
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,834
Captain to First Officer,
I'm beaming down.

402
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,583
Would you care to
comment privately

403
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,500
on how you read
any of this?

404
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,291
Unnecessary, sir.

405
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:34,083
These people are honest,
almost to a fault,

406
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:37,333
and they have great pride
in their ways.

407
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,667
You're the Captain?

408
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,166
We're ready.

409
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,542
This way, please.

410
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:02,000
Welcome to our world, Captain.
Thank you.

411
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,125
We regret that our system of
justice is troubling you.

412
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,917
The boy, Wesley Crusher,
where is he, please?

413
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,875
In accord
with the Prime Directive,

414
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,750
I've allowed them to hold him
pending the outcome of this.

415
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,291
He is safe
and unharmed.

416
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:16,875
We promise that.

417
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,375
Captain Picard, I do not
know how you Earth people

418
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,083
conduct law and justice--

419
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,500
even if you respect
such things.

420
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,125
We do.

421
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,458
Good. So do we.

422
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:32,500
Our precepts have been
handed down from long ago.

423
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,834
The tranquility you see in
our lives has been made possible

424
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,166
by our laws.

425
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,917
RIVAN:
We are a people of law.

426
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:41,208
They do sometimes
bring us sadness,

427
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:44,041
but we have learned
to adjust to that.

428
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,250
Perhaps your laws
work as well?

429
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,542
They haven't always,
but now they do.

430
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,834
Do you execute criminals?

431
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:54,125
No, not any longer.

432
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,500
RIVAN:
But you did once?

433
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,375
Unfortunately, yes.
But since then...

434
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:01,250
And when you did, was it
believed necessary to do so?

435
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:05,333
Some people felt
that it was necessary,

436
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:08,709
but we have learned to detect
the seeds of criminal behavior.

437
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:11,375
Capital punishment,
in our world,

438
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:14,333
is no longer considered
a justifiable deterrent.

439
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,792
So...

440
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:19,875
we are not yet
as advanced as they are.

441
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:24,458
And since you are advanced
in other ways, too,

442
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:28,333
I suggest you use your superior
powers to rescue the Wesley boy.

443
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:31,166
We will record him
as a convicted criminal

444
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,834
out of our reach--

445
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:36,458
an advanced person who luckily
escaped the barbarism

446
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,709
of this backward little world.

447
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:43,041
Unfortunately, we have a law
known as the Prime Directive.

448
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:45,583
Riker has explained it to us.

449
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:50,875
Is the boy in any danger
from you at this moment?

450
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,166
Until sundown?

451
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,709
Because you
are strangers,

452
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,917
we are delaying
enforcement of the law,

453
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:04,709
but we must act
by sundown.

454
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:06,917
Then I have another question.

455
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,709
While orbiting-- while circling
high above your world--

456
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:14,542
as we do, we have
encountered a strange object.

457
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:17,875
A vessel, perhaps.

458
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:20,333
Have you any idea what it is?

459
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,875
It's not entirely real.

460
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:26,834
At least it's not
completely solid.

461
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:32,250
Do you mean God?

462
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,333
God?

463
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:37,375
God is said to be
somewhere up there

464
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,083
protecting us.

465
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,083
Exactly...

466
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,417
exactly how would you
describe God?

467
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:44,959
As you just did.

468
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:48,417
As existing both here
and in another place, also.

469
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,500
But when God wants to
show its power,

470
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,000
it can make itself felt
most fully.

471
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:59,125
BEVERLY:
Captain, come in, please.

472
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,375
Picard here.

473
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:01,917
CMO Crusher, sir.

474
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:04,041
Commander Data has just
regained consciousness.

475
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,834
What condition? Can he talk?

476
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:08,792
He's insisting on it,
sir, urgently.

477
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:13,583
Wesley...

478
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,917
Stand by. Picard out.

479
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:21,125
I want to speak to her
personally about her son.

480
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:28,208
And so you promise that Wesley
Crusher is safe until sundown?

481
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,625
You have our word.

482
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:35,458
Then will one of you
return with me to our ship?

483
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:39,375
Of course.

484
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,333
I'll go as a hostage
for the boy's safety.

485
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,917
No, no, no, that's not it.

486
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:45,875
I want you to identify
something for me, if you can.

487
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:49,333
Picard to Transporter Room,
three to beam up.

488
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:57,709
I'm frightened.

489
00:28:57,709 --> 00:28:59,000
There's no
reason to be.

490
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,083
Transporter Room,
energize.

491
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:15,375
But this is a city!
A great city.

492
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:18,333
Captain, I've just seen the
away team report about Wesley.

493
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,959
In a moment, Doctor.

494
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,333
In a moment?!

495
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,500
Exactly. In a moment.

496
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:28,166
You were about to say?

497
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,458
Well, since you have
all this power,

498
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,875
why be concerned
about our laws?

499
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,208
You could take
the boy from us.

500
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,583
It's not that simple.

501
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,917
From the
starboard lounge

502
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,542
you can see whatever
is outside this vessel.

503
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,583
Do you mean my world?

504
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,625
You said we'd be
high above it.

505
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,875
And something else
that's circling your world.

506
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,417
It's very
important to us

507
00:29:57,417 --> 00:30:00,333
and perhaps to you
to know what it is.

508
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:18,542
I'm sorry, Rivan,
but this was necessary.

509
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,542
Do you know what that is?

510
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,250
Can you tell us
what it is?

511
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,583
Is it God?

512
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:35,250
Now, it's very important
that you answer something.

513
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,792
How do you recognize
what it is?

514
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:47,834
Nothing will harm you,
I promise.

515
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:50,792
Just tell us
how you recognize it.

516
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:54,834
It has appeared before.

517
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:59,250
Can you speak to it?

518
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,500
Does it speak
to you?

519
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,333
Captain!

520
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:13,208
Return my child!

521
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,291
Return?

522
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,959
It's coming
towards us.

523
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:22,333
Picard to Transporter Room.

524
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:24,458
Come in.

525
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,750
Yes, do that, but hurry!

526
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,417
It's still coming towards us.

527
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:30,208
Transporter Chief to Captain.

528
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,250
One to beam down
to away team location.

529
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,583
Hurry!

530
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:37,417
Engage, Transporter
Room. Urgent, engage!

531
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,458
It seems the Edos' god is
very protective of its children.

532
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:03,417
I had no choice but to learn
about that thing from her.

533
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:05,917
I'm sorry I had to.

534
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:08,083
She was so frightened.

535
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,500
It's understandable, sir.

536
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Sharing an orbit with God
is no small experience.

537
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:18,458
Let's go see your patient,
Doctor.

538
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,417
What do you intend
to do about my son?

539
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:28,125
He's being held safely
until sundown.

540
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,667
When he faces execution!

541
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,834
Although he's
committed no crime--

542
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:33,917
certainly none any sane
and reasonable person...

543
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:36,166
You saw what that thing
was about to do.

544
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:39,500
I apologize, sir,

545
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,208
but this is very
difficult for me.

546
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:44,542
If he were your son,
you'd be as frightened...

547
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,208
But I am.

548
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:52,000
Data's in Sick Bay here.

549
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,667
You'll find him able
to talk to you.

550
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:58,792
He's checking out
fine, Doctor.

551
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,417
Thank you.
Finish it later, please.

552
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,834
I was an excellent choice
for them, Captain.

553
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:06,750
They were able to
communicate with me quite...

554
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,250
I was about to say
quite easily,

555
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,083
but there was nothing
easy about it.

556
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:13,000
Fortunately,
they stopped short

557
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,709
of overloading
my circuitry.

558
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:17,458
You're saying<i> they?</i> 
So it is a vessel of some sort?

559
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,875
Definitely not a single entity,
if that's what you mean, sir.

560
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,583
Although they know the Edo
worship them as a god thing.

561
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,250
They know?

562
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,750
They recognize that this is
quite expected and harmless

563
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,709
at the present Edo stage
of evolution.

564
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:32,542
What sort of vessel?

565
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,375
It is perhaps not

566
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,333
what we would understand
as a vessel, sir.

567
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:39,625
The dimensions this one occupies
allows them to be...

568
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:42,458
well, to be
in several places at once.

569
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:46,458
That they consider that this
entire star cluster is theirs.

570
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,000
It was probably unwise of us

571
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,583
to attempt to place
a human colony in this area.

572
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,583
Of course, there are
3,004 other planets

573
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:56,291
in this star cluster in which
we could have colonized.

574
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,750
The largest and closest...

575
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,500
Data! Don't babble.

576
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Babble, sir?

577
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,333
I am not aware
that I ever babble, sir.

578
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,583
It may be
that from time to time

579
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,750
I have considerable
information to communicate

580
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,166
and you may question the way
in which I organize it...

581
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:15,458
Please, organize it into
brief answers to my questions.

582
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,333
We have very little time.

583
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:21,166
Do they accept

584
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:23,333
our presence at this planet?

585
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,709
Undecided, sir.

586
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:31,000
Data, please feel free

587
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,542
to volunteer
any important information.

588
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:35,625
I volunteer

589
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:37,709
that they are now
observing us, sir.

590
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,125
To judge what kind
of life-forms we are?

591
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:43,041
No. It is more curiosity.

592
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:46,625
I doubt that they expect us
to abide by their value systems.

593
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,875
Do they know
of our Prime Directive?

594
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:52,250
They know everything I know,
sir.

595
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,250
And if we were to violate
the Prime Directive...

596
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,291
That's not a fair question.

597
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:02,875
How would they react?

598
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:06,250
That would be a case of judging
us by our own rules, sir.

599
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,000
If we violate
our own Prime Directive,

600
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,250
they might consider us to be
deceitful and untrustworthy.

601
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,000
You do recall,
they cautioned us

602
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,083
not to interfere with
their children below.

603
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,792
What has happened?

604
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:24,750
The Edo want to
execute my son.

605
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,041
I will not allow that
to happen, Jean-Luc!

606
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:31,208
Most interesting, sir.

607
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,667
The emotion
of motherhood

608
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,625
as compared to all others
felt by humans...

609
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:37,083
Shut up!

610
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,500
You were right, sir.

611
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,208
I do tend to babble.

612
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,917
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41255.9:</i>

613
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:53,959
<i>Whatever the object</i>
<i>or vessel in orbit with us,</i>

614
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:56,875
<i>it hangs there</i>
<i>like a nemesis.</i>

615
00:35:56,875 --> 00:36:00,250
<i>It is one thing to communicate</i>
<i>with something mysterious,</i>

616
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,667
<i>but it is quite another</i>
<i>to be silently observed by it.</i>

617
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:06,166
<i>I am concerned</i>
<i>whether it understands</i>

618
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,542
<i>the same concept</i>
<i>of reason that we do.</i>

619
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,792
You sent for me, sir?

620
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:15,375
Let's have
more talk, Data.

621
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,083
Yes, sir.

622
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,208
Sit down.

623
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:27,542
What level of
communication, sir?

624
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,542
Any.

625
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:32,959
My apologies for saying
that you babbled.

626
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:35,083
But I do, sir.

627
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,583
You also see things
in a way we do not

628
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,709
but as they truly are.

629
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:41,500
I need help, my friend.

630
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,875
I cannot permit that boy
or any member of this vessel

631
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,208
to be sacrificed.

632
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,667
The Prime Directive
never intended that.

633
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:52,959
The problem, sir, is there.

634
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:55,500
Although they have learned
of the Prime Directive

635
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,291
from my mind,

636
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,291
how will they evaluate it?

637
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,458
How do they reason?

638
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:02,917
What are their values?

639
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:05,125
Remember their
warning to us, sir.

640
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,792
Exactly.

641
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:09,583
How do I explain my refusing
to obey their laws down there?

642
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:13,291
Not permitting
the Crusher boy...

643
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:15,417
to be executed.

644
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:17,625
And by so doing,
do I endanger this vessel

645
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:20,542
and more than
a thousand other lives?

646
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:25,000
Would you choose one life
over 1,000, sir?

647
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:30,333
I refuse to let arithmetic
decide questions like that.

648
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,959
Did you learn anything

649
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,417
about the relationship
between that and the Edo?

650
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:38,125
Why are they so certain
it's a god?

651
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,125
Any sufficiently
advanced life-form

652
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,625
would appear to others
to be that, sir.

653
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,750
But when they were probing
my thoughts, Captain,

654
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,834
I could feel that
whatever they are now,

655
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:51,792
they once existed in this
dimension just as we do--

656
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:55,750
perhaps in the same kind
of flesh and blood form.

657
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,291
Since then, however,

658
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:00,125
they have evolved
considerably.

659
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,625
Their present existence
in multi-dimensions

660
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,583
no doubt has advantages
we do not understand.

661
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,542
Then, in some earlier
flesh-and-blood form,

662
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:10,834
they might have shared
our kind of values?

663
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:13,208
We know the Edo
share them, sir.

664
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,041
Why would such
an advanced thing

665
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:18,458
feel obliged
to protect the Edo?

666
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:23,375
Perhaps the Edo are
a child race, by comparison.

667
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,583
Possibly a race which...

668
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,917
those life-forms
have planted here

669
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:30,166
much as we now plant
human colonies

670
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,667
on class M planets.

671
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:40,291
Having fulfilled
my professional obligations

672
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,917
regarding Commander Data...

673
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:44,417
You now request permission
to beam down to the planet.

674
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,333
Permission granted.

675
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:49,041
You can accompany me
while I try and resolve this.

676
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:55,250
And you should know
that whatever the cost

677
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,417
I will not allow them
to execute your son.

678
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,875
Thank you, sir.

679
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,959
Data, take command.

680
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:11,458
Aye, sir.

681
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,917
It's almost time.

682
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:25,166
I want the boy
brought here now.

683
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,041
I'll go with you.

684
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:31,000
Of course.

685
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,667
Captain Picard.

686
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,875
I saw you share
the sky with God.

687
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,250
You must be gods.

688
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:58,083
No, no, we're not gods.

689
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,041
Mother.

690
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:09,959
I guess you know
a lot has happened here.

691
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,959
I know.

692
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:17,792
Captain Picard...

693
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:20,000
are you going to
let them kill me?

694
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,667
No.

695
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:26,083
But I must find some way to
prevent it that<i> you</i> understand.

696
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,333
How can we let
this happen, Liator?

697
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:32,166
They threaten
everything we respect.

698
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:36,375
Our law, our peace,
our tranquility and order.

699
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,291
You are powerful,

700
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,041
but do not do this to us.

701
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:41,375
We beg you.

702
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:44,375
At least, study what
we were without law--

703
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,542
hurtful to each other,
savage, thieving.

704
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:49,667
I understand.

705
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:52,917
Perhaps your system of law
and punishment

706
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,000
is better than any system
we once had,

707
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,291
but we do now have a law
and must obey.

708
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,041
And part of it says

709
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,834
that I must protect
my people from harm.

710
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:05,834
We did not ask you
to come here.

711
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:09,166
Which has to do
with another law

712
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,875
that we must obey.

713
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:14,375
We are all sworn
not to interfere

714
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,250
with other lives
in the galaxy.

715
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,834
If I save this boy,
I break that law.

716
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:21,625
And you should
be executed if you do so.

717
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,375
I may suffer almost as much.

718
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:26,291
Starfleet takes the Prime
Directive very seriously.

719
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:30,041
No, it is God
who will punish you.

720
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:32,458
That thought
has crossed our minds.

721
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,250
Your God up there may insist

722
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,000
that we obey our
noninterference directive.

723
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,667
Sir, does this mean
if you save me,

724
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,625
the entire crew could die?

725
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,750
You're not involved
in this decision, boy.

726
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,291
I'm sorry, sir,
but it seems like I am.

727
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:53,083
Picard to Transporter Room.
Lock in to this signal.

728
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,750
Stand by for six
to beam up.

729
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,250
Wesley, Lieutenant.

730
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:05,834
Our laws have been violated.

731
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:07,417
What of justice?

732
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:09,750
What of justice to Wesley?

733
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,083
Does he deserve to die?

734
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,500
I'm truly sorry, Liator,
but I must have justice

735
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,542
for my people, too.

736
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:19,375
Transporter Room, energize.

737
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:28,500
Transporter Room, come in.

738
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,041
We can't energize the beam, sir.

739
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:32,500
Everything checks out,
but we're getting no results.

740
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,041
God has prevented
your escape.

741
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,875
Then your God
is unfair.

742
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:39,625
My son had no warning
that his act was criminal.

743
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:42,333
We cannot allow
ignorance of the law

744
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,875
to become a defense.

745
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,542
I don't know how
to communicate this,

746
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:48,709
or even if it is possible,

747
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:52,125
but the question of justice has
concerned me greatly of late.

748
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,750
And I say to any creature
who may be listening,

749
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,959
there can be no justice
so long as laws are absolute.

750
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,792
Even life itself

751
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:04,542
is an exercise in exceptions.

752
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:08,375
When has justice ever been
as simple as a rule book?

753
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:14,792
Seems the Edo Lord agrees
with you, Number One.

754
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:27,750
Main viewer on.

755
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:35,125
Hailing frequencies.

756
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,834
Open, sir.

757
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,375
To the object in orbit with us.

758
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:43,667
We will remove
the human colonists

759
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:45,583
from the adjoining solar system

760
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,667
if you signal us
to do so.

761
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,709
Please tell us.

762
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:54,000
Captain.

763
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:00,750
Is that a signal?

764
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,166
I suppose...

765
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,291
I suppose it must be.

766
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,333
I was hoping for more.

767
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:09,667
More of what, sir?

768
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:11,542
I'm glad it's gone.

769
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:14,583
Agreed, sir,
short and sweet.

770
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,417
Godlike efficiency.

771
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:20,083
I was hoping we might learn
more about it,

772
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:23,125
but since we can't,

773
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:25,333
take us out of here,
Number One.

774
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,750
Gladly, sir.
