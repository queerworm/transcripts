1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:05,625
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46357.4.</i>

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,917
<i>We have rendezvoused</i>
<i>with the starship</i> Cairo

3
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:09,625
<i>near the Cardassian border</i>

4
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:12,333
<i>for an urgent meeting</i>
<i>with Vice-Admiral Nechayev.</i>

5
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,208
(<i> door chimes</i> )

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,542
Come.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,041
May I present
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

8
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,291
Admiral,
welcome on board.

9
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,250
Thank you.

10
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,375
That'll be all,
Commander.

11
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:27,542
Can I get you
some coffee, tea?

12
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,041
Thank you, no, Captain.

13
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,709
I'm afraid there's no time
for the usual pleasantries.

14
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,250
I'm here to relieve you
of command of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

15
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:10,875
(Picard)
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

16
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:14,667
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

17
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,750
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

18
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:20,709
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

19
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,041
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

20
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,709
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

21
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,041
The Cardassian forces

22
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,709
which were recently withdrawn
from the Bajoran sector

23
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,709
have been redeployed
along the Federation border.

24
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,834
They have mobilized
three divisions of ground troops

25
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,583
and their subspace
communications

26
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,917
have been increased by 50%.

27
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,709
We believe that
they're preparing

28
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,083
for an incursion
into Federation space.

29
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,208
Are the Cardassians
ready for a war?

30
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,500
I didn't say "war," Commander.

31
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,083
I said "incursion."

32
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,959
Our intelligence
reports suggest

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
that they'll try to seize
one of the disputed systems

34
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,333
along the border.

35
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,667
We think they're gambling

36
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,500
that the Federation
won't actually go to war

37
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:02,458
over one system.

38
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,834
Will we?

39
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:07,959
I hope we won't need
to make that decision.

40
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,208
We have decided
to send the<i> Enterprise</i>

41
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,375
to meet with a Cardassian
representative

42
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,125
and open talks.

43
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,917
We're hoping that the presence
of the Federation flagship

44
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,834
on the border will send
a message to their leadership

45
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,750
about just how seriously
we view this situation.

46
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,667
Where is Captain Picard?

47
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,417
The captain,
your chief medical officer,

48
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,208
and security chief
have been reassigned.

49
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,583
That's all I can tell you
for now.

50
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,834
Do any of you know
Edward Jellico?

51
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,041
He is the commanding officer
of the<i> Cairo.</i>

52
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,917
I've heard of him, I don't know
that any of us have ever...

53
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,208
I'm giving
him command

54
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,917
of the<i> Enterprise</i>
this afternoon.

55
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,041
Captain Jellico
helped to negotiate

56
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,208
the original armistice
two years ago,

57
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,083
and I believe he's
the most qualified person

58
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,917
to lead this mission.

59
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,625
The change of command
will take place at 1300 hours.

60
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,834
Thank you.

61
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,750
Admiral,
with all due respect...

62
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,709
it's not necessary

63
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,500
to give Captain Jellico
command of the<i> Enterprise</i>

64
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,375
just to conduct
a negotiation.

65
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,417
I disagree.

66
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,625
The<i> Enterprise</i> will be

67
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:14,959
in a dangerous situation,

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,875
and I want someone
on the Bridge

69
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:18,125
who has a great
deal of experience

70
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,500
with the Cardassians.

71
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,750
No offense, Commander,
but that's not you.

72
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,250
MAN:
Halt!

73
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,792
PICARD:
Computer, freeze program.

74
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,917
You were five seconds
slower that time.

75
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,458
You increased the
difficulty level, sir.

76
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,250
Mr. Worf, it's going
to be far more difficult

77
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,333
where we're going.

78
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,208
Which is where, exactly?

79
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,875
I'm sorry,
I can't tell you that yet.

80
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,208
WORF:
It would be helpful

81
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,000
to know something
about our mission.

82
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,125
Mr. Worf, I have my orders.
I'm sure you understand that.

83
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,375
Now, Doctor, this deflector
wasn't set properly.

84
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,709
It must be positioned
so that the emitter array

85
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,625
blocks the entire passageway
or it's useless.

86
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,000
Sorry. I was concentrating
on getting away

87
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,625
from the last Cardassian.

88
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,542
Or maybe it was
the falling rocks?

89
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,542
I understand this is difficult.

90
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,333
All I can do
is ask you to trust me.

91
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,000
All right,
let's do it again.

92
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,250
All right, Mr. Worf

93
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,083
I want you to time
the doctor and me

94
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,291
through that first tunnel,
and this time

95
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,458
we're going to pick up
those five seconds.

96
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,125
Welcome aboard, sir.

97
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,250
I'm commander...

98
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,834
William T. Riker,
class of '57.

99
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,500
Graduated eighth
in his class.

100
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:41,959
I'm looking forward
to serving with
you, Commander.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,583
Thank you,
and I, you.

102
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sure this
change in command

103
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,959
has taken everyone
a little by surprise.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,166
Well... yes, sir.

105
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,709
It caught me
by surprise, too.

106
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,625
I must admit,
I miss the<i> Cairo</i> already,

107
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,500
but a galaxy-class ship,
that's something special.

108
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,041
I can understand
why you turned down

109
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,291
a ship of your own
to remain aboard.

110
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,750
Yes, sir.

111
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,834
How many duty watches
does the crew stand?

112
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,709
We have a standard
three-shift rotation.

113
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,667
I'd like to change that
to four starting tonight.

114
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:08,583
I'd also like to examine
the duty roster

115
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,458
and the crew evaluations
as soon as possible.

116
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,291
I want readiness reports

117
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,083
from each department head
by 1400 hours

118
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,959
and a meeting
of the senior staff at 1500.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,250
Do you prefer Will
or William?

120
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,250
Um, Will sir.

121
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,875
Where are my quarters, Will?

122
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,792
We have you assigned
to cabin 735...

123
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:29,291
Deck seven,
I'll see you at 1300 hours.

124
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,583
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

125
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,792
Attention to orders!

126
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,458

of Captain Edward Jellico.

I relieve you, sir.

143
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:44,291
I stand relieved.

144
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,083
Dismissed.

145
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,208
I wonder how permanent
this is going to be.

146
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,875
I don't know.

147
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,625
They don't usually
go through the ceremony

148
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,417
if it's just a
temporary assignment.

149
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,500
Sore?

150
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,959
Oh... sore doesn't
begin to describe it.

151
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,583
I know.

152
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,750
I wish I could talk about it.

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,750
Most of the
secondary systems

154
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,083
were changed
at the last overhaul.

155
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,709
I don't think they'll
give you any problem

156
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,625
but you might
want to check out
the port lateral...

157
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:43,083
I'll take care of the
<i>Enterprise,</i> Jean-Luc.

158
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,709
You don't have
to mother me.

159
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,333
Uh...

160
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,625
How's your team shaping up?

161
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,792
Very well...

162
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:56,000
but I would prefer more
recent intelligence

163
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,709
on the exact layout
of the installation.

164
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,959
The most current information
that we have is two years old.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,250
Two years?

166
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,834
I don't know how Nechayev
ever talked you into this.

167
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,959
She gave me no choice.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,625
Well, maybe there's something
we can do to help.

169
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:18,125
We'll launch a class-5 probe
just before we reach the border.

170
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,375
You could pick up the telemetry
aboard the shuttle.

171
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:24,875
Now that would be
extremely helpful.

172
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,583
Will?

173
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,834
Captain.
Captain.

174
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,458
I believe we're
scheduled to arrive

175
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,750
at the Cardassian border
during delta shift.

176
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,583
Please inform
the delta tactical officer

177
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,625
that I want to launch
a class-5 probe

178
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,291
just before
we drop out of warp.

179
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,792
I was actually going to talk
to you about delta shift

180
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,333
a little later, sir.

181
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,542
Right now, gamma shift will be
on duty when we arrive

182
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,041
and I will tell
Lieutenant McDowell
about the probe.

183
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,667
Is there a problem
with delta shift, Will?

184
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,125
There is no
delta shift yet, sir.

185
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,834
I have spoken
to the department heads

186
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,583
about changing from
three shifts to four

187
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,125
and they assure me
it's going to cause

188
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,166
a significant
personnel problems.

189
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,667
So you have not changed
the watch rotation?

190
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,333
I was going to
explain this to you

191
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,709
after the ceremony, sir.

192
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,208
You will tell the department
heads that as of now

193
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,291
the<i> Enterprise</i> is
on a four-shift rotation.

194
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,625
I don't want to talk about it.

195
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,792
Get it done.

196
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,750
Now that means that delta shift

197
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,542
will be due to come on duty
in two hours.

198
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,375
I expect you
to have it fully manned

199
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,500
and ready when it does.

200
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:30,834
Is that clear?

201
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,208
Yes, sir.

202
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,417
If you'll excuse me, sir.

203
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,667
Captain.

204
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

205
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,250
He was your first officer
for five years.

206
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,083
One of the finest
officers

207
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,792
that I have ever
served with.

208
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:53,250
Of course he is,
Jean-Luc.

209
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,041
I'm sure it'll all work out.

210
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

211
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:04,333
JELLICO:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46358.2.</i>

212
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,208
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is on course</i>
<i>for a rendezvous</i>

213
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,166
<i>with the Cardassian ship</i>
Reklar.

214
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,208
<i>Fortunately, I still have time</i>

215
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,875
<i>to prepare the ship and crew</i>
<i>for the task ahead.</i>

216
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:15,625
I want you to install a bypass
between the main phaser array

217
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,125
and the secondary generators.

218
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,166
I also want to run
the main deflector pathway

219
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,792
through the warp power grid

220
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:23,417
and the auxiliary conduits
through the lateral relays.

221
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,041
Now, you may have to reconfigure
the transfer interface.

222
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,250
Sir, the transfer interface

223
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,375
was not designed
for that configuration.

224
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:31,333
It will take seven hours
to make those changes.

225
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,959
Sir, you may not be aware
that our normal interface

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,542
already routes auxiliary power
through three separate relays.

227
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,083
I'm aware
of your current design system.

228
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,083
It's not good enough.

229
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,875
If these negotiations fail

230
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,500
we could find ourselves
in a war zone

231
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,583
and if that happens
I want to be loaded for bear.

232
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,917
I'll get right on it.
Good.

233
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,000
Now, these stations
should be devoted

234
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,166
to damage-control
and weapons status from now on.

235
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,458
See that they're manned
at all times.

236
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,667
Aye, sir.

237
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:57,458
Mr. Data,
how long before we reach

238
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,875
the rendezvous point?

239
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:01,667
We will arrive
in 51 hours, 32 minutes, sir.

240
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,917
Schedule four battle drills

241
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:04,917
one for each shift.

242
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,083
Run a series

243
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,208
of simulated attacks

244
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,834
from a Cardassian squadron.

245
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,250
I want you to conduct
the exercises personally, Will.

246
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,166
Get it done.

247
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,125
Oh...

248
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,583
and get that fish
out of the Ready Room.

249
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,959
Data, you're with me.

250
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,959
The power transfer levels
need to be upgraded by 20%.

251
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,500
The efficiency
of your warp coils

252
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:37,709
is also unsatisfactory.

253
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,875
Coil efficiency is

254
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,542
well within
specifications, Captain.

255
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,417
I'm not interested
in the specs, Geordi.

256
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,792
The efficiency needs to be
raised by at least 15%.

257
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,542
15 percent?

258
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,333
That is
an attainable goal,

259
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,875
but it will require
realigning the warp coil

260
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:55,291
and taking the secondary
distribution grid off-line.

261
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,583
Very good, Data.

262
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,917
That's exactly what
I want you to do.

263
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,000
If we take this grid off-line,

264
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,583
we're going to have to shut down
Exobiology, the Astrophysics Lab

265
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,375
and Geological Research.

266
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,709
We're not on
a research mission.

267
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,750
Get it done...
in two days.

268
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:11,208
I believe that is also
an attainable goal.

269
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,959
If we utilize the entire
Engineering Department

270
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,417
there should be

271
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,792
sufficient manpower available
to complete the task.

272
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:19,208
Sure, if everybody works around
the clock for the next two days.

273
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,500
Then you'd better
get to it, Geordi.

274
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:23,166
Looks like you have
some work to do.

275
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,834
Data.

276
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

277
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

278
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:46,208
Yes?

279
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,834
May I speak with
you, Captain?

280
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,041
Deanna, come in, come in.

281
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:01,750
The latest masterpieces
from my son.

282
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,625
It's an elephant...

283
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,792
I think.

284
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:08,542
Definitely an elephant.

285
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:12,166
I'm glad you're here.

286
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,291
I'd like to go over
the duty roster with you.

287
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,959
I'd be happy to,
but, first

288
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,917
I'd like to talk about
how the change in command

289
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,250
is affecting the crew.

290
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,542
I've noticed some resistance.

291
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,792
I wouldn't call it
resistance.

292
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,291
More like... uncertainty.

293
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,417
Most of them had served
under Captain Picard

294
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,917
for several years.

295
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,667
They knew him and they knew
what he expected.

296
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,625
Now they're being asked
to adjust to a new captain

297
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:47,208
and a new way of doing things,
and they're uncertain

298
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,750
how to react.

299
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:52,208
I see your point.

300
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,333
This all could be
very unsettling to them.

301
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,542
And to you.

302
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,750
Perhaps everyone
just needs time.

303
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:02,000
Time for you to get to know

304
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,417
and trust the crew
and time for them

305
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,959
to understand how you
want things done.

306
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,291
I'm glad you brought this
to my attention, Deanna.

307
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:17,291
Unfortunately, I don't have time
for a honeymoon with the crew.

308
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,458
You've clearly

309
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
given this a lot
of thought,

310
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:23,125
so I'd like you to take charge
of the morale situation.

311
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,291
Please see to it
that they make the adjustment

312
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,375
to the new routine
quickly and easily.

313
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:31,667
Oh, I have a meeting
with the new security chief

314
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:32,917
in five minutes,

315
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,583
so the duty roster
will have to wait.

316
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,333
Thank you, Counselor.

317
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,041
By the way...

318
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,667
I prefer a certain...
formality on the Bridge.

319
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:53,125
I'd appreciate it
if you wore a standard uniform

320
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,750
when you're on duty.

321
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,041
Of course, sir.

322
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,625
LA FORGE:
Commander, he's asked me
to completely reroute

323
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:06,792
half the power systems
on this ship,

324
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:08,083
change every duty roster

325
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,291
realign the warp coils
in two days,

326
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,375
and now he's transferred
a third of my crew to security.

327
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:14,083
If it makes you feel any
better, you're not alone.

328
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,625
Captain Jellico
has made major changes

329
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,208
in every department
on the ship.

330
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,291
Yeah, well, I don't
mind making changes,

331
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,959
and I don't mind hard work,

332
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,709
but the man isn't giving me
the time I need to<i> do</i> the work.

333
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,500
Somebody's got to get him
to listen to reason.

334
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:25,667
It's not going to be me.

335
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,250
He's made that
abundantly clear.

336
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,750
Well, then can I make
a suggestion?

337
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,417
Talk to Captain Picard.

338
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,959
Maybe he can
do something.

339
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,750
We just need
a little time.

340
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,000
All right.

341
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,250
(<i> door chimes</i> )

342
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,959
Come.

343
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:00,333
You all right, sir?

344
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,792
Yes, I am,

345
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:05,709
but the last time
I had to train like this

346
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,750
was for the Academy marathon

347
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:10,166
but... I'm managing.

348
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,709
What can I do for you?

349
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,041
It's nothing urgent.

350
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,875
I'm sorry
I bothered you.

351
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,250
Good night.

352
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,875
(<i> sighs</i> )

353
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,417
My orders are
to maintain radio silence

354
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,333
until we've completed
the mission.

355
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,625
Well, the<i> Enterprise</i>
will be monitoring
your channel

356
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,458
just in case you do need
to transmit a signal.

357
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,542
RIKER:
Bridge to Captain Jellico.

358
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,917
We've arrived at the shuttle
departure coordinates.

359
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,125
Did you launch
the probe I requested?

360
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,542
Yes, sir. I wasn't aware
you wanted to be informed.

361
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,417
Thank you.
Jellico out.

362
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,333
(<i> muttering</i> ):
I can see why he's still
only a first officer.

363
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,208
Captain, I would just like you
to know that Commander Riker...

364
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,625
I've read your
reports, Jean-Luc.

365
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,208
I know you think
highly of him.

366
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,041
It's not just my opinion.

367
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,917
He's been decorated
by Starfleet Command five times.

368
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,625
He's been offered his own ship
more than once.

369
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:19,458
I think if you just
gave him a chance

370
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,083
you would find him
an outstanding officer.

371
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:28,792
Jean-Luc, let's be
candid for a moment.

372
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:32,125
The Cardassians aren't
going to listen to reason

373
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,625
and the Federation isn't going
to give in to their demands,

374
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:37,417
and the chances are you
won't be coming back

375
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,500
from this mission
of yours.

376
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,709
I want this ship
ready for action,

377
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,125
and I don't have time

378
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:48,500
to give Will Riker
or anyone else a "chance."

379
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:57,083
And forgive me for being blunt,
but the<i> Enterprise</i> is mine now.

380
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,959
Well... here's hoping

381
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,542
you beat the odds.

382
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,959
Good hunting.

383
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,959
Thank you.

384
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,250
Jean-Luc...

385
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,959
I believe this is yours.

386
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,792
Shuttlecraft<i> Feynman</i>
to<i> Enterprise.</i>

387
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:48,333
We have cleared
the shuttle bay.

388
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,667
RIKER:
Acknowledged,<i> Feynman.</i>
Good luck.

389
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:51,834
Thank you,<i> Enterprise.</i>

390
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,625
Well...

391
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,792
now that we're underway

392
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,625
I can tell you
about our mission.

393
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,583
Starfleet intelligence
believes that the Cardassians

394
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,917
are developing
a metagenic weapon.

395
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,792
Oh, my God.

396
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:14,709
I am not familiar
with metagenics.

397
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,125
They're genetically
engineered viruses

398
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,667
that are designed to destroy

399
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:19,667
entire ecosystems.

400
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:20,959
When metagenic toxins

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,542
are released
into a planet's atmosphere

402
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,208
they immediately
begin to mutate.

403
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,041
They seek out and destroy
all forms of DNA they encounter.

404
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,041
In a few days

405
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,834
everything is dead.

406
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,125
In a month
the metagenic agent itself

407
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,208
breaks down
and dissipates completely

408
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,542
leaving every city, every road,
every piece of equipment

409
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,667
perfectly intact.

410
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,583
Leaving the planet safe
to be conquered.

411
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,500
Wouldn't using
such a weapon

412
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,208
pose as great a risk
to the attacker

413
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,458
as to the target?

414
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,041
That's why metagenics

415
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,500
and other biological weapons
were outlawed years ago.

416
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:57,667
Even the Romulans

417
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,375
have abided with
those agreements.

418
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:02,625
Starfleet intelligence
believes that the Cardassians

419
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:05,291
are developing
a new delivery system

420
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,041
one that would protect them

421
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,542
from accidental exposure
to the toxin.

422
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,375
They believe
that the Cardassians

423
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:16,875
are testing a way of launching
dormant metagenic material

424
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:18,959
on a subspace carrier wave.

425
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,041
So they could activate
the toxins after the launch

426
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,792
thereby preventing
any accidental exposure.

427
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:29,333
Mm-hmm.
And because the subspace wave

428
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,333
would appear simply
as background radiation

429
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,417
no one would realize
what was happening

430
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,542
until it was too late.

431
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,417
Now, for the past
few weeks

432
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,291
theta-band
subspace emissions

433
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,542
have been detected
coming from Celtris III.

434
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,875
These emissions
may indicate

435
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:50,125
that a metagenic delivery system
is in operation.

436
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,375
What do we know
about Celtris III?

437
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:53,542
Very little.

438
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,834
It was thought to be uninhabited

439
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,417
until these emissions
were detected.

440
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,291
Starfleet believes
that the Cardassians

441
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,083
may have a secret research lab

442
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,917
located somewhere
below the planet's surface.

443
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:08,959
Our orders are to penetrate
this Celtris III installation

444
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,917
and determine if the Cardassians

445
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:13,917
are actually building
a metagenic weapon.

446
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,291
And if they are?

447
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:20,083
Destroy it...
at any cost.

448
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,583
When I was
on the<i> Stargazer</i>

449
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:26,000
we conducted extensive tests
using theta-band carrier waves.

450
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,875
One of the reasons I was
selected for this mission

451
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,375
is my familiarity

452
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,375
with the methods used
for generating them.

453
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,709
Mr. Worf, your presence
here is obvious.

454
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,542
Doctor, your job will be
to locate and to destroy

455
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,709
any biotoxins
we may find.

456
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,959
Celtris III
is in Cardassian space.

457
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,834
How will we get there
undetected?

458
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:52,417
I... know a way of acquiring
some discreet transport.

459
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:57,333
Mr. Worf, set a course
for Torman V.

460
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,709
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

461
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,333
If he doesn't pay up

462
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:24,417
I know three
<i>large</i> Ferengi

463
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,917
who will not be
so forgiving.

464

(<i> cackling</i> )

465
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,375
I didn't do it.

466
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,458
We're not accusing you
of anything.

467
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,083
What do you want then?

468
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,667
We're looking
for Daimon Solok.

469
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,417
Why?

470
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,375
We have a business
proposition to discuss.

471
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,917
Solok is a very busy,
very important man.

472
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:54,125
He isn't here.

473
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,917
But I could relay a message.

474
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:02,208
Good.

475
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,625
Please, will you
tell Daimon Solok

476
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:07,333
that we're interested
in transportation...

477
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,625
(<i> softly</i> ):
to Celtris III?

478
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:13,125
That's a Cardassian planet.

479
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,375
Uh-huh.

480
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:19,083
Now, we understand
that Daimon Solok

481
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,500
runs<i> cargo</i> there

482
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:24,166
from time to time.

483
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:27,000
Solok is no smuggler.

484
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:30,125
Yes, but if Solok were
to go to Celtris III

485
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,667
for legitimate reasons

486
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:36,750
we would be interested
in quietly booking passage

487
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,208
for the journey.

488
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:44,333
I don't think
he would be interested

489
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,750
in dealing
with Federation spies.

490
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:49,542
You know...

491
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:55,417
I heard that Solok
was quite a man.

492
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:58,625
Why... yes.

493
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:03,125
He is a...
extraordinary man.

494
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,542
That's why we came here

495
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:09,125
because only Solok
could help us...

496
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,792
but I guess there
are some things

497
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:13,083
even Solok can't do.

498
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,625
It's too bad.

499
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,625
Because...

500
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:23,500
if he could,
I would be...

501
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:26,000

503
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,291
Yes?

504
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,417
Grateful.

505
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,625
When do you
want to leave?

(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

507
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,208
Beverly, make sure
that your tricorder

508
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,625
is keeping a precise
map of the route.

509
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,959
It would be very easy
to get lost in here.

510
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,291
Right.

511
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,917
(<i> louder, rapid beeping</i> )

512
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,458
I'm picking up

513
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,458
some subspace signals

514
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,917
but I can't seem
to get a lock on them.

515
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,083
That's typical
of theta-band emissions.

516
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,458
You have to compress
the detection bandwidth

517
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,333
in order to determine
the fix.

518
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:35,667
The source emission is 500
meters east of here, and...

519
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,583

They're harmless.

533
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,291
He's waiting for you
in the Observation Lounge.

534
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,458
Very good.
I'll be in my Ready Room.

535
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:24,458
(<i> door chimes</i> )

536
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,583
Yes?

537
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:33,417
Captain, I think there's been
a slight miscommunication.

538
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,375
Did you want to meet
with Gul Lemec in here?

539
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:40,959
No, the Observation Lounge
is appropriate.

540
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,333
I see.

541
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,333
Lemec is a Cardassian

542
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,250
and Cardassians
are like timber wolves--

543
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,834
predators--

544
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:57,417
bold in large numbers,
cautious by themselves,

545
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:01,208
and with an instinctive need
to establish a dominant position

546
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,709
in any social gathering.

547
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,667
So you're trying to establish
a dominant position

548
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:08,583
by making him wait for you.

549
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,667
The trouble with wolves

550
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:17,125
is that sometimes in the fight
for dominance

551
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,875
one of them ends up dead.

552
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:24,583
In that case, the trick is

553
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:28,959
to be the wolf that's
still standing at the end.

554
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,709
The floor is over
500 meters down from here.

555
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,208
There doesn't seem to be
a way around.

556
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,583
We'll have to rappel
from here.

557
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,041
This is sheer granite.

558
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,875
We'll have to use fusing pitons.

559
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:54,083
We could try to find
another way down.

560
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,250
Unfortunately, that would take
several hours.

561
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,000
We don't have the time.

562
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,500
You're not afraid of heights

563
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,041
are you, Doctor?

564
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,750
Of course not.

565
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,750
Now, remember to control
your descent.

566
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:38,792
Don't get the lines tangled.

567
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:40,333
I'll remember.

568
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,208
All right?

569
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:05,625
What is going on?

570
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,291
I've been waiting here
for over an hour...

571
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,375
I'm Captain Jellico.

572
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:09,750
I believe you know
Commander Riker

573
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:10,834
and this is Lieutenant
Commander Troi.

574
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:11,917
Let's get to it,
shall we?

575
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,291
This treatment

576
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,458
is a deliberate insult
to the Cardassian Union.

577
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,959
I have been kept waiting
here for over an hour.

578
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,041
Then I'm sure
you're ready to talk.

579
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:26,834
I did not agree

580
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,959
to allow others
into this meeting.

581
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,792
If it alarms you,
I can ask them to leave.

582
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:34,417
I am not alarmed,
but we did not...

583
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,625
A great many people
are depending

584
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,834
on our efforts here, Gul Lemec.

585
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:40,041
We don't need to quibble
over minutiae.

586
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,875
I have come to negotiate

587
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:45,500
a Federation withdrawal
from the borders

588
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,208
not to be dictated to

589
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,500
by some mere captain.

590
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:54,875
I can see you're not serious
about these talks.

591
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:57,125
If the Cardassian Union

592
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,083
truly wishes to discuss peace

593
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,750
they can send someone

594
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,792
who can negotiate
in a civilized manner.

595
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:12,208
Captain on the Bridge.

596
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,625
Let him stew
for a few minutes.

597
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,875
Then go in and tell him
that you've convinced me

598
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:22,166
to meet with him
one more time.

599
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,542
Tell him I'm a loose cannon

600
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,125
and that he needs to be
more reasonable

601
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:27,000
because I'm such
an unreasonable man.

602
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,959
Lemec will want to bring
his own aides on board.

603
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,417
Pretend to be worried

604
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:33,291
that I'll object, and then
give grudging permission

605
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,083
for two aides, no more.

606
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,208
Understood?

607
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,500
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.

608
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,667
Well, I'll say
this for him--

609
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:45,542
he's sure of himself.

610
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:48,166
No, he's not.

611
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:03,709
The installation should be
about 300 meters... this way.

612
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,166
I don't suppose
we'll be able

613
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,583
to find another way
to get back up there.

614
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:13,583
I doubt it.

615
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,250
That's what I thought.

616
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,083
Hmm...

617
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:55,083
There's a lava tube beyond here
that runs for 75 meters.

618
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:58,375
Then it connects
with another chamber.

619
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:00,458
We need to get through here.

620
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:08,583
This tube opens up
beyond this crack.

621
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,166
If we could widen
the opening

622
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,333
then we should be able
to crawl through.

623
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,417
Mr. Worf?

624
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,291
A phaser set at level 16
should suffice.

625
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,458
Make it so.

626
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,667
Well done, Mr. Worf.

627
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:59,834
Gul Lemec.
A pleasure.

628
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:04,625
May I present my aides
Glinn Corak and Glinn Tajor.

629
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,083
Welcome aboard.

630
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,709
For the past three weeks

631
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,834
you've been massing troops
in staging areas

632
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,166
assembling strike forces

633
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,959
and pulling ships
from their normal patrols.

634
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,917
We will not stand for this

635
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,875
clearly provocative
behavior.

636
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,959
I see the Federation
spy network

637
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,959
has again provided you
with faulty information.

638
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,041
We are conducting
routine training operations

639
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,375
nothing more.

640
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:40,333
Then I'm sure you won't mind

641
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:42,709
if we send a few starships
into this sector

642
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,709
for our own...
training operations.

643
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,709
Your fleet deployments
do not concern us.

644
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,250
However, we are very concerned

645
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,750
with your refusal to vacate
those territories

646
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:55,250
along the border
which are clearly Cardassian.

647
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:57,625
You gave up your claims
on those territories

648
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:59,208
when you signed the armistice.

649
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,417
You couldn't take those worlds
by force, so you

650
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:03,583
want us to<i> give</i> them
to you at the bargaining table.

651
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,750
Captain, please.

652
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,166
We should
listen to them.

653
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,291
Gul Lemec, as you know

654
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,417
the systems
are still under negotiation

655
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:14,917
by the terms of the treaty.

656
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:18,458
Negotiations which<i> we</i> have
pursued in good faith.

657
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,333
Unfortunately, the Federation
has not been as forthcoming.

658
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:25,625
So, to speed up the process,
you are preparing for war.

659
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:28,250
We are preparing
to defend ourselves.

660
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,542
The Federation
will not start a war.

661
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,834
That has always been
your position.

662
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:38,667
However, I have heard reports

663
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:40,083
that a small team
from the Federation

664
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:43,291
has already been sent
into our territory.

665
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:46,000
Of course, I
don't believe it.

666
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,500
Such an attempt

667
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:49,583
would almost certainly fail

668
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:52,625
and even if it succeeded,
it would trigger

669
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:57,208
a<i> very</i> serious response
on our part.

670
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,083
I don't know what
you're talking about.

671
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,917
Then there's no need for worry.

672
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:08,458
A brief recess
would seem to be in order.

673
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:11,583
Very well.

674
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,750
Where is Captain Picard?

675
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,583
Reassigned.

676
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:23,417
Well, I hope his new assignment
is not too dangerous.

677
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,083
It would be a shame

678
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:28,959
if something were to happen
to such a, uh...

679
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,458
such a noted officer.

680
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,834
Yes...

681
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,875
it would.

682
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:50,500
PICARD:
Only a few more meters.

683
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,625
Beverly, get
out of there!

684
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,875
Beverly!

685
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,583
WORF:
I have her.

686
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:46,500
(<i> Crusher coughing</i> )

687
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,792
Are you all right?

688
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:53,083
I think so.

689
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,834
Next time,<i> you</i>
try bringing up the rear.

690
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,083
We're nearly there.
Can you continue?

691
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,875
PICARD:
It looks like
a maintenance hatch

692
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:17,542
to the installation.

693
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:20,375
I'm picking up three
proximity sensors around it.

694
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,458
Sensor echo is established,

695
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,166
but the false image
will only last a few minutes.

696
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:42,583
The hatch is
magnetically sealed,

697
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,542
but I believe
I can bypass it.

698
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,291
I can't get a scan from the
other side of the hatch.

699
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:48,083
It's been shielded.

700
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,959
We have no choice.

701
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,500
Remember, aim low

702
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,750
and fire in short,
controlled bursts.

703
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,000
Ready.

704
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,458
Now.

705
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:17,041
CRUSHER:
There's no one here.

706
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,542
There's no lab.

707
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:27,709
It's a trap. Come on!

708
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:02,166
Captain!

709
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,750
(<i> gasping</i> )

710
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,500
Let's go.

711
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,625
The captain!

712
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,000
No. There are
five more of them

713
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:25,041
heading this way
from another tunnel.

714
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,417
Come on.

715
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,583
Now!

716
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,959
Come on.

717
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,000
Captain on the Bridge.

718
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:05,500
What have you got, Will?

719
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:06,750
I'm not sure.

720
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,166
We're picking up
a lot of coded messages

721
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:09,750
from a Cardassian planet
near the border.

722
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:10,792
Which planet?

723
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:12,041
Celtris III.

724
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,583
Can you detect
any theta-band

725
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,458
subspace emissions
coming from Celtris?

726
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,333
There are some
residual traces.

727
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,417
It seems that there
were emissions

728
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:19,291
up until a few minutes ago.

729
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:20,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

730
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,792
Open a secure channel
to Admiral Nechayev.

731
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:24,583
Priority two.

732
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:25,750
Put it through
to my Ready Room.

733
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:26,959
Aye, sir.

734
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,834
Captain?

735
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,792
Those emissions you were
so concerned about

736
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,125
have just stopped.

737
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:46,458
I'd say one way or another

738
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,333
our friends
have finished their task.

739
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,458
Have you heard
from our friends?

740
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,333
No.

741
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:56,125
Let me know if you do.

742
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:58,875
I would very much like
to see them again.

743
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,667
So would I, Admiral.

744
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,667
A challenge.

745
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:44,125
You should prove
an interesting challenge.

746
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:47,542
Possibly the most interesting
to come through that door

747
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:48,875
in many years.

748
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:50,959
What do you want?

749
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,291
Why, you, of course.

750
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:55,917
Picard...

751
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:57,458
Jean-Luc.

752
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:03,166
Serial number...

753
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:10,583
SP-937-215.

754
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,625
Son of Maurice
and Yvette Picard.

755
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:18,333
Born in La Barre, France.

756
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:21,583
Formerly, captain
of the<i> Stargazer</i>

757
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,208
where you conducted
extensive studies

758
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,458
on theta-band subspace
carrier waves.

759
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:31,083
Don't look so surprised.

760
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,667
How could we have
designed a lure

761
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:34,583
for the captain
of the Federation flagship

762
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:37,417
unless we knew something
about his background?

763
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:39,750
So you concocted
an elaborate ruse

764
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:40,875
to bring me here.

765
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:42,125
Why?

766
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:45,792
In this room,
you do not ask questions.

767
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:50,291
I ask them.
You answer.

768
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:53,750
If I am not satisfied
with your answers

769
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:55,125
you will die.
