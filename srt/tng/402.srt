00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:05,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44012.3.</i>

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:08,917
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> remains docked</i>
<i>at McKinley Station</i>

3
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:10,959
<i>undergoing</i>
<i>a major overhaul and refit</i>

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,667
<i>following the Borg incident.</i>

5
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:15,667
<i>I am confident</i>
<i>that the ship and her crew</i>

6
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:18,333
<i>will soon be ready</i>
<i>to return to service.</i>

7
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,500
Thank you.

8
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:20,834
Please take that
to Engineering.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,959
Phaser upgrades
are complete, Commander.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,375
Already?

11
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:31,542
And we have begun power
supply calibration.

12
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,125
Well, you're just too
damned efficient Lieutenant.

13
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,625
Thank you, sir.

14
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:39,000
Continue with the
testing, Mr. Worf.

15
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,542
Here's the final schedule
for the shore leave

16
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,625
and for the personnel
transfers.

17
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,375
By the way, I'm
looking forward to
meeting your parents.

18
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,500
Sir?

19
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:49,500
They're on the
visitors' list.

20
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:51,709
You didn't know?

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,792
No, sir.

22
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,458
It is inappropriate
for a Klingon

23
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,959
to receive
family while on duty.

24
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,417
As humans, my parents
do not understand.

25
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,959
Well, I'm not sure
that I would either, Worf

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,417
since this isn't a Klingon ship.

27
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,125
If you don't want
to see your parents

28
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,875
that's your business

29
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:15,417
but we don't get back
to Earth that often.

30
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,750
I'm sure we could
arrange for you to have

31
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,417
more off-duty time
while they're here.

32
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,750
No... sir.

33
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:24,083
That will not
be necessary.

34
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,875
Dismissed.

35
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:29,041
Mr. Worf.

36
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,500
If you're worried
that they might learn

37
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:32,125
about what happened
on the Klingon planet...

38
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,583
Not at all.

39
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,625
I have already informed them
by correspondence

40
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:39,458
of my discommendation.

41
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,542
I do not believe any human

42
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,625
can truly understand
my dishonor.

43
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:52,250
So, where have you
decided to go?

44
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,250
Hmm? What?

45
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,834
Oh... uh, France.

46
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,875
Labarre-- my
home village.

47
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,834
Really?

48
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,166
Yes.

49
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,500
It's the first time
in almost 20 years.

50
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:11,583
Interesting.

51
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,000
Counselor...

52
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,166
I just find it
interesting.

53
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,709
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

54
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,083
the man who couldn't
be pried out of his seat

55
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,250
for a vacation
for three years...

56
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,166
It's Earth. It's home.

57
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,125
Do I need
another reason?

58
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,500
I don't know.
What do you think?

59
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:33,500
Your help has been invaluable
during my recovery

60
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:37,208
but, look... I'm, uh...

61
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,542
I'm better.

62
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,542
The injuries are healing.

63
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,208
Those you can see in the mirror.

64
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,542
The nightmares have ended.

65
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,208
All I need now is
a little time to myself.

66
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,583
I agree.

67
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,875
In fact, I'm delighted
you're going.

68
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:58,333
It's just that... the choice
of where you're going

69
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,583
could stand some scrutiny.

70
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,000
If you wish to believe
that my going home

71
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,583
is a direct result of being
held captive by the Borg

72
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,834
be my guest.

73
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,542
Is that what
you believe?

74
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:13,417
I hate it when
you do that.

75
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,792
Captain, you do need time.

76
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:20,458
You cannot achieve
complete recovery

77
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,542
so quickly.

78
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,500
And it's perfectly normal,
after what you've been through

79
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:30,291
to spend a great deal of time
trying to find yourself again.

80
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,834
And what better place
to find oneself

81
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,917
than on the streets
of one's home village.

82
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,625
Interesting.

83
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,625
Have a good trip,
Captain.

84
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:42,250
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

85
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:46,291
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

86
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,083
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

87
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,834
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

88
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,458
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

89
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,917
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

90
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,125
They still have
not signaled?

91
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,875
No, sir.

92
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:17,458
My mother is never on time.

93
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,417
It is so... human of her.

94
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,417
Well, you know women.

95
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:28,083
I am not looking forward
to this.

96
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,250
I wish they would come

97
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,917
so it would begin
and end sooner.

98
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,709
I know what you mean,
Lieutenant.

99
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,333
Unlikely.

100
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,375
Last time my old man
was on board

101
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,000
I found him chasing
Nurse Stanton

102
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,333
around a bio-bed
in Sick Bay.

103
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:44,041
I'm not concerned about
my father chasing nurses.

104
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,208
Ah, but it's always something
with parents, isn't it?

105
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,250
WOMAN:
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is
Earth Station Bobruisk.

106
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,625
Two to transport aboard.

107
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,166
Energizing.

108
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,083
Mother, Father.

109
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,083
Worf.

110
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,667
You look good, son.

111
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,875
Put on a little
weight, huh?

112
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,000
No.

113
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,542
Sure you have.
Looks good on you.

114
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,458
Still working out with
those holodeck monsters,

115
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
I bet.

116
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,125
Let me take you...
Ah...

117
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,417
always good to meet
another chief petty officer.

118
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,625
Sergey Rozhenko, formerly
of the USS<i> Intrepid.</i>

119
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,208
Miles Edward O'Brien, sir.

120
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,208
Good to meet you.

121
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,417
Don't call me "sir."

122
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,041
I used to work
for a living.

123
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,291
He's joking.

124
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,000
The proudest
moment of his life

125
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,792
was when Worf earned
his commission.

126
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,417
Can you imagine an old
enlisted man like me

127
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,000
raising a boy
to be an officer?

128
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,417
Come along, Sergey.

129
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,625
There's plenty of time
to chat with the boys.

130
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:45,834
Your father has been

131
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,291
so looking
forward to this.

132
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,667
Yes, I want to
see everything--

133
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,083
the whole ship.

134
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,583
At home, I have
all the specs and diagrams

135
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,417
of the Galaxy-class
starships.

136
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,417
We are in the midst
of a repair.

137
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,250
I cannot give you
a complete tour.

138
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,125
Oh, I'm sure if you
asked the Captain...

139
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,083
You agreed not
to embarrass him.

140
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,208
Besides,
we have come

141
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,917
to see Worf,
not the ship.

142
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,542
Fine. Fine. Okay.

143
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,542
Your hair is a little longer,
isn't it, Worf?

144
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,083
(<i> bushes rustling</i> )

145
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,041
All right, whoever you are,
I can hear you.

146
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,583
Oh, good lord,
a highwayman.

147
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,250
A what?

148
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,500
A highwayman.

149
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:51,667
It's a robber who
attacks travelers

150
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:54,208
but none have
been reported

151
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,959
in this vicinity
for centuries.

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,583
But I'm not a robber.

153
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,250
Oh. I'm much
relieved, sir.

154
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,792
I know who you are.

155
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,709
Then you have
the advantage.

156
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,667
You're my nephew, Jean-Luc.

157
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:09,542
From the Starship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

158
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,166
Then you must be
my Uncle Rene.

159
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,875
I'm not your uncle.

160
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,875
It's the other way around.

161
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,500
Too bad, I rather
enjoyed the idea.

162
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:19,583
Why have you been
away so long?

163
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,041
Well, Starfleet
keeps me very busy.

164
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,417
Father says
you don't like it here.

165
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,041
I'm sure you
misunderstood.

166
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,750
No, I didn't.

167
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,375
He said so.

168
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:34,083
Well, Robert
and I, we...

169
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,667
Perhaps it's time
to change all that.

170
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:41,959
You know, you
don't seem so arro...

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,333
arro... you know.

172
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,291
Arrogant?

173
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,458
Yes, arrogant.

174
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,250
You don't seem
that way to me.

175
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,959
What does it mean, anyway?

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,458
Arrogant son-of-a...

177
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,000
Let's talk about
that later, shall we?

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,959
Mommy, he's here!

179
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,500
Mommy!

180
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,041
He's here!

181
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,750
Jean-Luc.

182
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,125
Marie.

183
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,458
It is so good
to finally meet you.

184
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,250
For me, too.

185
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,959
How are you feeling?

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,709
Oh, I'm fine.

187
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,834
Well, Robert and I
are delighted

188
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,667
that you've come
to stay with us.

189
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,542
I was...

190
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,208
I was thinking, I-I...
I might be imposing.

191
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,041
I could very easily stay
in the village.

192
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,542
Oh, I wouldn't hear of it.

193
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,041
It's your home and it
will always be your home.

194
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,542
Do things look that different?

195
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,083
PICARD:
Oh, no.

196
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,333
In fact, it's amazing
how little it has changed.

197
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:57,125
Everything is exactly
as I remember it.

198
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,875
The house, hills.

199
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:04,333
Every tree, every bush

200
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,875
seems untouched
by the passage of time.

201
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,375
Robert has worked hard
to keep it that way.

202
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:14,667
It's...
it's very important to him.

203
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:18,875
As it was to our father.

204
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:23,250
Someday I'm going to
be a Starship Captain.

205
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:27,875
You look exactly like Robert
when he was your age.

206
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:30,792
I half expect
to see myself

207
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:34,834
as a boy, come running
out of that door to play.

208
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,291
Robert can't wait to see you.

209
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,875
Rene has already
told me.

210
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,834
Where is he?

211
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,208
As usual, with his vines.

212
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:05,208
So, you arrived at last.

213
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,250
Welcome home, Captain.

214
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,291
Hello, Robert.

215
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:15,792
You, uh... shuttled in
from the village?

216
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,291
No, I...

217
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,834
I decided to walk.

218
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:23,208
I met Marie and Rene.

219
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,417
Good... good.

220
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,417
It's, um...

221
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,959
good to see you.

222
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,542
Are you tired?

223
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,417
No.

224
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,208
Well, make yourself at home.

225
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,333
You know where everything is.

226
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,709
We generally eat about 8:00.

227
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,583
I must try and cure
this poor, sick vine.

228
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll see you shortly.

229
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,583
So, you'll have a chance
to visit the surface?

230
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,667
TROI:
Maybe.

231
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:23,917
Will and I have
been talking

232
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,542
about going back
to Angel Falls.

233
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,041
Oh, Venezuela's beautiful.

234
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,083
(<i> door chimes</i> )

235
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,875
Come in.

236
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,709
Great.

237
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,250
Thank you.

238
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,083
Something from home?

239
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,709
I left it here in storage
a long time ago

240
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,917
after Jack died.

241
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,750
Odds and ends, mostly.

242
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,166
<i>How to Advance Your Career</i>
<i>Through Marriage?</i>

243
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,959
It was a joke.

244
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,250
Jack sent it to me
when I was still

245
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,458
in medical school.

246
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,583
It was his way
of proposing to me.

247
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,375
What's that?

248
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:22,083
It's for Wesley, from Jack.

249
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,709
I'd forgotten it.

250
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,875
Maybe I was just trying
to forget it.

251
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:30,125
Why?

252
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,291
Jack recorded
a holographic message for Wesley

253
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,166
just after he was born.

254
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,125
It was a gift for him
when he grew up.

255
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,667
Jack was going to make
many more of them.

256
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:44,625
He never had the chance.

257
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,083
Are you afraid
of what it might say?

258
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,375
No. I just don't know if it'll
do more harm than good.

259
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:54,291
Wesley's finally come to terms
with his father's death.

260
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,667
Wesley has a lot of questions
about his father.

261
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,208
Things that you can't answer
for him.

262
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,250
Perhaps seeing this

263
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,709
will help him
understand.

264
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,834
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

265
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,083
WOMAN:
Check completed, sir.

266
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,375
MAN:
I have an intermittent failure

267
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:13,709
in response
to the azimuth step command.

268
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,000
We're checking.

269
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,250
LA FORGE:
Uh-huh.

270
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,583
SERGEY:
So we walk into the school

271
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,000
and we didn't know
what to expect.

272
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,250
Is Worf hurt?

273
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,375
Is he in some kind of trouble?

274
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,375
The door opens

275
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:28,458
and there is our little
seven-year-old sitting on a
chair

276
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,959
and glaring across the room
at five teenage boys

277
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,375
all of them
with bloody noses.

278
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:34,792
(<i> chuckles</i> )

279
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:37,250
And then the principal
looked up and said

280
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:41,667
"Please, tell me
he's an only child."

281
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:42,709
We have taken enough

282
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,291
of the Commander's time.

283
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,417
No, no, no, we're way
ahead of schedule here.

284
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,208
SERGEY:
I just wanted to tell him
the story about...

285
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,041
Enough stories, Sergey.

286
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,500
Okay, okay.

287
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:54,625
Enough stories.

288
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,625
Well, now, how about
giving us a look

289
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,458
at the new engine core?

290
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,750
I used to be a warp
field specialist

291
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,500
on the old Excelsior-class.

292
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:03,792
I'd be delighted.

293
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,000
Mrs. Rozhenko?

294
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh, no, no, no,
you two go ahead.

295
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,750
Your father will be hours.

296
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:14,583
Worf, why don't you
show me the arboretum?

297
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:18,750
Commander La Forge,
call me when you...

298
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:21,083
When my father
wishes to leave.

299
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,750
I can find my own way.

300
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:27,333
Turbolift four is, uh...
just over there, right?

301
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,959
I have all the specs
and diagrams at home.

302
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,125
The theta-matrix
compositor makes

303
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,750
the recrystallization process
ten times more efficient

304
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:37,500
than the old
Excelsior-class ships.

305
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:38,834
Amazing.

306
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,166
Commander, if you have
a couple of minutes

307
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,458
there is something else
I want to ask you.

308
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,542
Sure, Chief.

309
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,959
It's about my son.

310
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
...and your friend Louis

311
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:04,583
wants you to contact him
as soon as you're settled.

312
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,583
Is he still trying to
raise the ocean floor?

313
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,458
Oh, yes,
he's very excited about it.

314
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,333
He's been made
a supervisor now

315
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,250
as his wife
is constantly reminding

316
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,166
anyone who'll listen.

317
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,625
And I see no good reason

318
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:20,333
why the Earth should have
another subcontinent.

319
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,041
It's really quite
exciting actually

320
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,709
if you understand
the potential

321
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,000
of exploring a new world
on our own planet.

322
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,834
Well, I'm afraid

323
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,834
that I do not understand
this potential.

324
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,000
The mayor wants
to give you a parade.

325
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,250
RENE:
Thank you.

326
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,458
A parade?

327
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,041
Give you the keys
to the city.

328
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,041
Oh, no.

329
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,250
No, no, no, no.

330
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,917
He just needs a little
arm-twisting, dear.

331
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,625
A little coaxing.

332
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,208
No, he does not.

333
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,542
I'm here to rest and spend
some time with my family.

334
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,959
Well, I've already
warned the mayor

335
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,083
not to make any plans
without talking to us.

336
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,041
Thank you.

337
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,500
So...

338
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:02,375
<i>Salut.</i>

339
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:03,500
<i>Salut.</i>
<i>Salut.</i>

340
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,041
<i>Salut.</i>

341
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,500
This the '46?

342
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,291
Forty-seven.

343
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,375
You've been drinking too much
of that artificial stuff.

344
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:19,750
What do you call it?

345
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,834
Synthehol?

346
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,125
It's spoiled you.

347
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,792
Ruined your palate.

348
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:25,959
On the contrary.

349
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,542
I think that synthehol
heightens

350
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,000
one's appreciation
for the genuine article.

351
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,000
Mmm.

352
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,583
Delicious, Marie.

353
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,083
Thank you.

354
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,250
Leave it to Robert

355
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,875
to find
the best cook in France...

356
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,458
then marry her.

357
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,250
Yes. Sadly, cooking
is becoming a lost art.

358
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,417
That's your wretched
technology again.

359
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,208
Robert and I have had
more than a few

360
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,750
discussions about getting
a replicator in the house.

361
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,542
I remember
the same "discussions"

362
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,792
between Mother and Father.

363
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:03,333
Father understood
better than anybody else

364
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,208
the danger
of losing those values

365
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,709
which we hold most precious.

366
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,291
I don't see
that you have to lose anything

367
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,083
just by adding a convenience.

368
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,291
Well, you wouldn't.

369
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,959
But in my view

370
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,959
life is already too convenient.

371
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,792
This is a very old argument.

372
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,333
Hmm.

373
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,458
It is.

374
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,333
I wrote a report
on starships.

375
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,750
For school.

376
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,500
And he won a ribbon for it.

377
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:40,709
The teacher even said

378
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,000
it was one of the best
he'd ever heard.

379
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,041
Good for you, uncle.

380
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,291
You know what?

381
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,875
I once wrote a report
on starships

382
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:49,875
when I was about your age.

383
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,625
Did you win a ribbon, too?

384
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,917
I don't recall.

385
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:59,000
And I don't find your modesty
very convincing, brother.

386
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,500
Of course you won the ribbon.

387
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:02,083
You always did.

388
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,625
Well, do you still have it?

389
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,000
Hmm?

390
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,583
Your report.

391
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,500
No, I don't think so.

392
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:15,333
Well, I still have mine.

393
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,750
Why don't you go
and get it

394
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:18,875
and then you can read it
to your uncle.

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,291
It's hard enough
to protect him...

396
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,709
To protect him
from all that's out there

397
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,166
without you encouraging him.

398
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,834
(<i> spoon clinks on bowl</i> )

399
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,625
I'm not encouraging him.

400
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,125
But if you weren't
so narrow-minded

401
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,542
if you allowed him to see
the world as it really is...

402
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,917
Well, you raise your own sons
as you would wish

403
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,333
and allow me
to do the same with mine.

404
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:06,041
MAN:
Ah, one man's idea
of paradise.

405
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,250
PICARD:
No, my dear Louis,
two men--

406
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,834
Robert's and my father's.

407
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,875
(<i> Louis laughs</i> )

408
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,333
Never did I know anyone

409
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,250
less interested in grapes
than you, Jean-Luc.

410
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,041
Oh, no, not true.

411
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,250
I was interested.

412
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,709
And I was proud that

413
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,250
my family were helping
to preserve the traditions.

414
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,709
I just didn't feel bound
by those traditions.

415
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,208
You always reach
for the future

416
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,750
and your brother
for the past.

417
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:40,041
There should be room
for both in this life.

418
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,375
And what about you,
you old rascal?

419
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:45,166
You've taken quite a shift
into the future yourself.

420
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,291
Well, hydroponics turned
out to be so dull.

421
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,333
Well, you should
have listened to me
at the beginning.

422
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,917
If I had listened to you,
I never would have

423
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:55,542
taken that cycling trip
with the Bloom sisters.

424
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,917
And broken your leg?

425
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:59,667
And got married-- twice.

426
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:00,834
I hear you've been promoted

427
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,709
to supervisor
of the Atlantis Project.

428
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,917
I am one of 200 supervisors

429
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,166
although my wife
would have you believe

430
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,500
I run the entire project.

431
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:11,208
Well, it's certainly
very exciting work.

432
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,583
I've kept up on it
in the journals.

433
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,583
Really?

434
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,583
Mm-hmm.

435
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,250
It's only...

436
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,041
There's just one thing
I don't understand.

437
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,625
You were such
a rotten swimmer, Louis.

438
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:24,417
(<i> both laugh</i> )

439
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,083
Thinking of you working
on the ocean floor...

440
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:32,083
I suppose we all find ways
to confront our greatest fears.

441
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,667
Seriously, how do you plan
to accelerate the buildup

442
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:37,291
on the underside of the mantle
without increasing the stress

443
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,000
on the tectonic plates?

444
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:42,333
Oh, you really have
kept up, haven't you?

445
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,709
Well, the truth is,
we don't know-- yet.

446
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,417
On the<i> Enterprise,</i>
we used harmonic resonators

447
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,959
to relieve the tectonic
pressures on Drema IV.

448
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,291
Obviously, it's not
the same problem...

449
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,000
You know, it's
such a shame.

450
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,291
The government is looking

451
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,125
for someone to take
over the project.

452
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,458
A real leader who'll go in
there and get things moving

453
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,542
and they are looking for
<i>you, Jean-Luc.</i>

454
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:07,750
But I know, I know, you'd
never leave Starfleet.

455
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:11,417
No, I'd never
leave Starfleet.

456
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,500
That's what I thought.

457
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:14,834
But, if nothing else
why don't I

458
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,625
send over some of
the internal studies

459
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,208
on the tectonic problem

460
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,625
since you're interested.

461
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:22,083
We could use any thoughts
you might have.

462
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,500
All right.

463
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:33,250
It's a great crew, son,
and they think the world of you.

464
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,166
They really do.

465
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,166
Mother, Father, I...

466
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:48,625
I wish you would be
a little more... reserved

467
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,959
while you are
on board.

468
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,542
I know.

469
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,417
We go too far
sometimes.

470
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,333
We're just excited
to be here.

471
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,709
Riker to Lieutenant Worf.

472
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,291
Worf here.

473
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:04,291
I need to talk to you
about the phaser test results.

474
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,959
On my way,
Commander.

475
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,250
Have Guinan call me
if you need anything.

476
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,166
Maybe we should
just leave it alone.

477
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,125
I can't just
leave it alone.

478
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,917
I'm his mother.

479
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:39,583
GUINAN:
You know, sooner or later,
everyone comes in here.

480
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,458
They stand by those windows

481
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,125
and they look out
and they stare.

482
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,250
And they're looking
for that

483
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:48,625
little star
they call home.

484
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:52,250
It doesn't matter
how far away it is.

485
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:56,083
Everybody looks anyway.

486
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,417
I'm Guinan.

487
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:58,458
How do you do?

488
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,000
Pleased to meet you.

489
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,375
You're Worf's parents.

490
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,000
Sergey and Helena
Rozhenko.

491
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,083
Welcome.

492
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,041
Sit, please.

493
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,250
Thank you.

494
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

495
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,875
There's something I
would like to ask you.

496
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:14,583
Please.

497
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:19,083
How come you never
gave him prune juice?

498
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,583
I beg your pardon?

499
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,709
Well, he said
he'd never had it

500
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,083
till he came here.

501
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,583
Now he can't get enough of it.

502
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:26,917
Worf?

503
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,750
He never wanted
any human food

504
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:30,458
while he was growing up.

505
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,083
Everything had to be Klingon.

506
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,458
HELENA:
I learned to cook

507
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,834
<i>rokeg</i> blood pie.

508
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,333
However we never
quite learned

509
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,083
how to eat it.

510
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,208
It was a difficult adolescence.

511
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,125
But you got through it.

512
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:50,792
We didn't do
anything special.

513
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,333
Didn't you?

514
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:54,542
Just look at him.

515
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:57,834
I think he's pretty special.

516
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:00,417
We knew it wouldn't
be easy for him

517
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,041
growing up
without other Klingons

518
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,250
to turn to for guidance.

519
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:07,208
We had to let him discover
and explore his heritage

520
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,917
by himself.

521
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:13,250
Let him find his own path.

522
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,125
So many parents
could learn so much

523
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,667
from the two of you.

524
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,125
Well...

525
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:25,709
I'm afraid that Worf feels
that we do not understand him.

526
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,959
Well, part of him
may feel that way.

527
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,542
But there's another part
that I've seen.

528
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:38,417
The part that comes in
and drinks prune juice.

529
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:39,875
The part that looks
out the window

530
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:42,583
towards home.

531
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:47,000
But he's not looking
towards the Klingon Empire.

532
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,625
He's looking towards you.

533
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,500
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

534
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,166
Jean-Luc?

535
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,583
Are you all right?

536
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:08,709
I seem to have made a rather
disturbing discovery.

537
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,458
Louis mentioned that
the Atlantis Project

538
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,041
needed a director...

539
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:20,750
and I found myself
actually thinking about it.

540
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:22,125
Why shouldn't you?

541
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh...

542
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:27,750
Leaving my career,
the<i> Enterprise...</i>

543
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,542
Considering what you've
just been through...

544
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,083
No, no, no, it's not that.

545
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:37,166
Or is it?

546
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,250
Besides,
it would be wonderful

547
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,542
to have you back home.

548
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:43,583
Given a little time,
maybe you and your brother

549
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:47,875
might even get
to<i> like</i> one another.

550
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:51,792
Well, I already like
his choice in wives.

551
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,750
I never thanked you
for your correspondence.

552
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:56,083
It made me feel like
part of the family.

553
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,375
(<i> doorbell dinging</i> )

554
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,875
You're not<i> like</i>
part of the family.

555
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:01,917
You<i> are</i> part of the
family, Jean-Luc Picard.

556
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:04,709
Don't worry, dear.
I've got it.

557
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,875
Robert.

558
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,834
Louis, come in.

559
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,375
Let me get you some wine.

560
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,375
You can talk business.

561
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:13,709
Business?

562
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,000
Well, there's nothing
much to talk about.

563
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,083
I'm interested to know
what you thought

564
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,917
of our plans.

565
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,375
Well, I've only had a
chance to glance at them.

566
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:21,959
Uh, I've had a few ideas...

567
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,417
Wonderful.

568
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:24,917
We should discuss them
with the board of governors.

569
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,250
I've set up a meeting.

570
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:27,417
A meeting?

571
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,792
Just a preliminary
conversation.

572
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:30,792
Tomorrow morning?

573
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,917
Preliminary to what?

574
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:34,500
They want you.

575
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:36,583
I mentioned your interest
in the project, that's all.

576
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:37,625
That's all I had to say.

577
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:38,834
They jumped
at the prospect.

578
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:41,000
I never said
there was a prospect.

579
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:43,500
At least listen
to them, Jean-Luc.

580
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,500
All right, good.

581
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,000
Very good. Fine.
I'll listen to them.

582
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,208
You won't regret it,
Jean-Luc.

583
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,250
I promise you.

584
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,709
I'll see you
in the morning.

585
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,667
WESLEY:
I don't understand, Mom.

586
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:15,583
What kind of message?

587
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:19,583
I don't know exactly.

588
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:23,000
Your father made it a few weeks
after you were born.

589
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,709
Why?

590
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,709
He felt it was important
to say certain things.

591
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:35,625
And to make sure that he didn't
forget to tell you them later.

592
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:36,750
Do you know
what it says?

593
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:38,291
No.

594
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:39,417
But he wanted you
to have this

595
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,458
when you turned 18.

596
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,417
And I want you
to have it, too.

597
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

598
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,000
Enter.

599
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,917
Are we disturbing you?

600
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:02,250
No, no.

601
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:06,875
I thought you were going

602
00:30:06,917 --> 00:30:08,375
to your quarters
to sleep.

603
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:10,792
We just came by
to tuck you in.

604
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,333
Please.

605
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:19,834
When I heard you were
on the visitors' list

606
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:22,250
I was not sure
I wanted you to come.

607
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:35,917
I am glad you are here.

608
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,000
We had to come.

609
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:40,917
Our boy
was in trouble.

610
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:43,542
After we read your letter
about the discommendation

611
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,000
from the Klingons...

612
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,250
HELENA:
We didn't exactly

613
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,667
understand it all.

614
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:49,917
We didn't have to.

615
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,542
We know what kind
of man you are.

616
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:53,917
Whatever you did

617
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:56,875
we know it was
for a good reason.

618
00:30:56,917 --> 00:31:00,667
I must bear my dishonor alone.

619
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:02,792
That is not true.

620
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:05,208
I'm sorry if this
is too human of us

621
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,625
but whatever
you are suffering

622
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:12,000
you must remember
we are with you.

623
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,250
And that
we're proud of you.

624
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,625
And that we love you.

625
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,625
You are our son.

626
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:39,125
ROBERT (<i> quietly</i> ):
♪ Qu'il fait bon, fait bon... ♪

627
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:41,542
Careful.

628
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:45,917
You're not used to drinking
the real thing.

629
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:50,041
This, uh, synthehol

630
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:52,500
never leaves you
out of control.

631
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:53,792
Is that so?

632
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:56,208
That's so.

633
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,000
Well, this will.

634
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:06,667
Now,<i> there</i> is something
I'd like to see.

635
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,875
What's that?

636
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:13,333
The gallant captain
out of control.

637
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,917
Mind if I ask you
a question?

638
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,583
What the devil
happened to you up there?

639
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:29,709
Is this brotherly concern?

640
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,125
No.

641
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:34,375
Curiosity.

642
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:38,125
What did they do to you?

643
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,250
You know what happened.

644
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,750
Not precisely.

645
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:47,625
I gather you were hurt,
humiliated.

646
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:51,000
I've always thought you needed
a little humiliation.

647
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:53,208
Or was it humility?

648
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,375
Either would do.

649
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:06,583
ROBERT:
Why do you walk away?

650
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:08,542
That isn't your style.

651
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,500
PICARD:
I'm tired of fighting
with you, Robert.

652
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:11,542
Tired?

653
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:12,667
That's right!

654
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:15,542
Yes, tired
of the<i> Enterprise,</i> too?

655
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:20,417
The great Captain Picard
of Starfleet falls to Earth

656
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:24,500
ready to... plunge
into the water with Louis.

657
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:27,417
That isn't the brother
that I remember.

658
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:28,709
Still, I suppose
it must have seemed

659
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,041
like an ideal
situation, hmm?

660
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:34,166
Local boy makes good

661
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,250
returns home
after 20 years

662
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:38,000
to a hero's welcome.

663
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:39,125
I'm not a hero.

664
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,166
Of course you are.

665
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,333
Admit it.

666
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:42,834
You've never settled
for less than that

667
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:43,834
and you never will.

668
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:45,291
That's not true.

669
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,375
Cancel the parade?

670
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:48,625
In your favor?

671
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:49,792
No!

672
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:53,083
I never... I never
sought that rubbish.

673
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,959
Never sought?

674
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,291
Never sought president
of the school, valedictorian

675
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:02,333
athletic hero with your
arms raised in victory?

676
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,917
Valedictorian.

677
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:07,291
Arms raised
in victory...

678
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,625
Were you so jealous?

679
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,458
Yes, damn it!

680
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,417
I was always so jealous,
and I had a right to be!

681
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:15,500
A right?

682
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:18,166
I was always<i> your</i> brother.

683
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,000
Watching you receive the cheers.

684
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:23,583
Watching you break every rule
our father made

685
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,083
and get away with it.

686
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,041
Why didn't you
break a few rules?

687
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:28,750
Because I was
the elder brother

688
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,125
the responsible one.

689
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:32,125
It was my job
to look after you.

690
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,417
Look after me?

691
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,291
You? You were a bully!

692
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:39,417
Sometimes... maybe.

693
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:44,166
Sometimes I even enjoyed
bullying you.

694
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:48,083
All right, try it now.

695
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,458
Why did you come back,
Jean-Luc?

696
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,917
Did you come back

697
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:55,500
because you wanted me
to look after you again?

698
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:56,917
Damn you!

699
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,208
(<i> groaning</i> )

700
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,792
(<i> growling</i> )

701
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:33,000
(<i> laughing</i> )

702
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,250
Oh.

703
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:44,667
You were asking
for it, you know.

704
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,792
Yes, but you needed it.

705
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:51,041
You have been terribly hard
on yourself.

706
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,792
You don't know, Robert.

707
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:58,375
You don't know.

708
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:06,208
They took everything I was.

709
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,166
They used me to kill
and to destroy

710
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,583
and I couldn't stop them.

711
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:15,458
I should have been
able to stop them.

712
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,542
I tried.

713
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:23,083
I tried so hard.

714
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,500
But I wasn't strong enough.

715
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:29,208
I wasn't good enough!

716
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,959
I should have been able
to stop them.

717
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,750
I should...
I should...

718
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:38,500
So...

719
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:41,667
my brother is a human being

720
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:44,542
after all.

721
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:45,834
This is going
to be with you

722
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,750
a long time, Jean-Luc.

723
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,375
A long time.

724
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,583
You have to learn
to live with it.

725
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:57,500
You have a simple choice now--
live with it

726
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:00,542
below the sea with Louis

727
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:02,875
or above the clouds
with the<i> Enterprise.</i>

728
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:19,834
You know, I think
you were right after all.

729
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:24,583
I think I did come back
so that you could help me.

730
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,291
Do you know what?

731
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:30,583
I still don't like you,
Jean-Luc.

What happened here?

(<i> singing stops</i> )

745
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:04,000
Uh...
Uh...

746
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,083
Well, it's...
It's, uh...

747
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,667
it's entirely
my fault, Marie.

748
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:09,333
ROBERT:
Yes, uh, I fell down,
and then he fell down...

749
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,750
And then we both
fell down together.

750
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,750
We both... we both...
We both fell down

751
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,250
to-to-together.

752
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:22,583
Have you two
been fighting?

753
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:23,875
Fighting?

754
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,709
No. No.
No. Certainly not.

755
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,333
Shame on you both.

756
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:31,917
What would your father say
if he saw you like this?

757
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:35,583
He'd probably send us both
to bed without any supper.

758
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:36,667
Well, perhaps
it's just as well

759
00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:39,166
you got it out
of your systems.

760
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:41,625
Perhaps it was, Marie.

761
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,625
Perhaps it was.

762
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:47,542
I'll contact Louis
and cancel the meeting

763
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:49,375
with the board
of governors.

764
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:50,792
It's time
that I was going.

765
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:51,834
Already, Jean-Luc?

766
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,083
Uh-huh.

767
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:56,041
The ship will be ready
to leave orbit soon

768
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,583
and I belong aboard.

769
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,542
If I should ever
doubt that again

770
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:05,333
I know where to come.

771
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:17,834
Computer.
Load program, Crusher one.

772
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,917
Program complete.
Enter when ready.

773
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:34,542
Run program.

774
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,583
Hello, Wesley.

775
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:40,667
As I make this recording

776
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,625
you are about
ten weeks old.

777
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,125
I wanted you to know
who I am today.

778
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,583
You see, this Jack
Crusher won't exist

779
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:52,166
by the time you're
all grown up.

780
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:55,750
I'll be older,
more experienced

781
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,792
and hopefully
a little wiser.

782
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,041
But this person
will be gone.

783
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,125
And I want you to know
who your father was

784
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,458
when you came
into the world.

785
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,166
When I see you lying
there in your crib

786
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,917
I realize I don't
know the first thing

787
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:13,333
about being a father.

788
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,750
So let me just apologize
for all the mistakes

789
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:18,709
I'm about to make
as you grow up.

790
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,792
I hope you don't grow
up resenting the fact

791
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:24,291
that I was gone so much.

792
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:27,667
That comes with
this uniform.

793
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:29,208
I don't know if I can explain

794
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,250
why Starfleet means
so much to me.

795
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,375
Maybe you'll understand

796
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:37,041
when you get
this recording.

797
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:41,625
Maybe you'll even want
to try one of these on.

798
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:43,375
But you'll probably
be a doctor

799
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,083
like your mother.

800
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:48,750
You're only a baby,
but it's remarkable.

801
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:50,834
I can see in your face

802
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:53,542
all the people I've
loved in my lifetime--

803
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:54,625
your mother

804
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:57,041
my father and mother--

805
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:58,959
our family.

806
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,667
I can see me in you, too.

807
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:07,458
And I can feel
that you're my son.

808
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't know how
to describe it

809
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:11,792
but there's this...

810
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:13,667
connection.

811
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:17,250
This bond.

812
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:20,125
I'll always be a part
of you, Wesley.

813
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,166
(<i> chuckles</i> )

814
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:26,709
Well, I hope this makes
some sense to you.

815
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,125
I'm not sure that
it does to me.

816
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:33,417
But maybe I'll do
better next time.

817
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,166
I love you, Wesley.

818
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,291
Good-bye, Dad.

819
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,250
Come back and see us again.

820
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,959
Good-bye, Jean-Luc.

821
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:05,333
And be careful.

822
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:11,625
Take care... Uncle.

823
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:14,709
You, too.

824
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,917
Someday, I'll be leaving
for my starship, too.

825
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:21,875
Well, there's plenty
of time for that.

826
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:22,959
You may decide
to do something else

827
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,417
as you get older.

828
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:32,333
Jean-Luc, here is
a little of the '47.

829
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:34,166
Do not drink it all at once.

830
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,417
And if possible

831
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:37,166
try not to drink it alone.

832
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,667
Is there anything
you want us

833
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:13,291
to send you
from home?

834
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,750
No.

835
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:20,750
Perhaps some
of your<i> rokeg</i> blood pie.

836
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:23,542
Mmm, it's been a while

837
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,458
but I think
I still remember how.

838
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,709
Oh.

839
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,917
Ah, Captain.

840
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:30,875
Welcome back.

841
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:32,500
Thank you,
Lieutenant.

842
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:35,333
These are my parents,
Helena and Sergey Rozhenko.

843
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:36,917
Delighted.

844
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:38,625
Sir.

845
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:40,917
Quite a ship you
have here, Captain.

846
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:42,500
You had the full tour,
I trust.

847
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:44,667
Well, actually, there
are still a few areas

848
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:45,917
because of the repairs...

849
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,959
Sergey, it's time to go.

850
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,250
SERGEY:
Yes, yes.

851
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:50,917
Yes, okay.

852
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:53,125
I have all the specs
and diagrams at home.

853
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,333
He's still out there.

854
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:06,000
Mm-hmm.

855
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:08,041
Dreaming about starships

856
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:09,583
and adventures.

857
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,583
It's getting late.

858
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:16,959
Yes.

859
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,709
But let him dream, hmm?
