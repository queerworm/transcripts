1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:05,875
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42477.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:07,834
<i>The</i> Enterprise
<i>has been diverted</i>

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,959
<i>to the Ramatis Star System.</i>

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,875
<i>It seems that both sides</i>
<i>of a bitter planetary conflict</i>

5
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:14,834
<i>have petitioned Starfleet</i>
<i>to transport</i>

6
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,083
<i>to their world a mediator</i>
<i>they have mutually selected.</i>

7
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,417
<i>Our orders</i>
<i>are transportation only.</i>

8
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,125
<i>No interference.</i>

9
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,250
Reduce to half impulse.

10
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,208
Reducing velocity
to one-half impulse.

11
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,917
(<i> door chimes</i> )

12
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,458
Come.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,625
Ah, Number One,
look at this.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Ever since we left
the Lima Sierra system

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,000
I have been puzzling over
how the third planet

16
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,542
could maintain
such an orbit

17
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,750
when it's theoretically
impossible.

18
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:50,208
But consider this.

19
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:53,375
There's no degeneration.

20
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:54,625
Exactly.
Why?

21
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,458
Why?
I haven't a clue.

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,291
Well, perhaps this facsimile
lacks the proper mass.

23
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,625
Perhaps.

24
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,041
But if this is
an accurate representation,

25
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,667
it could explain what happened
in that system.

26
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,417
Perhaps.

27
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:13,041
Well, it's not a matter
of any great moment.

28
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,917
Just a knot
I had to untie.

29
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,709
So, what do you want
to see me about?

30
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,834
Oh, we've arrived
at Ramatis III.

31
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,208
Oh, well.

32
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,959
Time to leave.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,458
Standard orbit,
Mr. Crusher.

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,583
Standard orbit.

35
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,291
Mr. Data,
you have the Bridge.

36
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,709
Transporter Room 5.

37
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,583
I'm still a little
uncomfortable

38
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,375
with your leading
this away team.

39
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,166
This is not an away team,
Commander.

40
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,792
I consider this
a ceremonial function.

41
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:52,417
For me not to go could be
construed as lack of interest.

42
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,667
You will be careful, sir.

43
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:57,625
Oh, cluck, cluck, cluck,
Number One.

44
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:58,667
Sir?

45
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,917
You're being
a mother hen.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,959
I appreciate
your concern.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,792
Actually, I'm looking forward
to meeting this mediator.

48
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,834
We came a long
way to get him.

49
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,041
They wanted the best.

50
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:14,875
That, according to
all reports, is Riva.

51
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,375
If he can put an end
to all the years

52
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:19,083
of bloodletting
on those planets...

53
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,500
I think we should
do everything

54
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:21,792
in our power
to assist him.

55
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:24,417
Our job is not
to police the galaxies.

56
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,750
Isn't that my speech,
Number One?

57
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:28,500
No, of course
you're right.

58
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,375
We must not
get involved.

59
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,750
Coordinates
have been input, sir.

60
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,458
Have your
sensors indicated

61
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,125
any problem down
there, Lieutenant?

62
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,625
None.

63
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:40,083
But you're feeling
a certain confusion

64
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,208
about this
mission.

65
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,125
No.

66
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:49,333
Yes. I've never known you
to have such strong emotions

67
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,667
except when you're expecting
to do battle.

68
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,542
I am not expecting battle.

69
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,625
Then what is
bothering you?

70
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:02,583
Riva.

71
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,250
Ah.

72
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,417
Riva negotiated
several treaties

73
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,500
between the Klingons
and the Federation.

74
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:15,959
Before him, there was no
Klingon word for "peacemaker."

75
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,208
Then I can understand why
you're feeling uneasy.

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,625
PICARD:
Now, look.

77
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,625
This is a simple
ceremonial greeting.

78
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,959
Nothing more.

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,917
All right.

80
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,333
Aye, sir.

81
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,250
Energize.

82
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:44,959
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,250
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

84
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

85
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:55,250
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

86
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:59,583
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

87
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:04,041
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

88
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,834
Captain, this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

89
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,792
We've arrived safely,
Number One,

90
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,125
but so far
we've been ignored.

91
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,542
I'll keep you informed.

92
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,750
I would appreciate it.

93
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,041
Captain.

94
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,834
WORF:
Sir.

95
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:54,291
Riva.

96
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,291
<i>Please, come closer.</i>

97
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:28,125
<i>Before I start,</i>
<i>is there anything you need?</i>

98
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,291
<i>Food? Refreshments?</i>

99
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,291
Thank you, no.

100
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,208
<i>Then proceed.</i>

101
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,750
Greetings from the United
Federation of Planets.

102
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,667
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

103
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,417
This is Counselor Troi.

104
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,166
Lieutenant Worf.

105
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,959
<i>Greetings.</i>

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,667
<i>Welcome to Ramatis.</i>

107
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,166
<i>I have been</i>
<i>expecting you.</i>

108
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,000
<i>You are empathic.</i>

109
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,375
Yes.

110
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,417
<i>Then although you already</i>
<i>know my feelings toward you,</i>

111
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,458
<i>allow me put</i>
<i>them into words.</i>

112
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,458
<i>I am looking forward</i>
<i>to this journey</i>

113
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,000
<i>now more than ever,</i>

114
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:17,583
<i>because it gives me a chance</i>
<i>to be in your company.</i>

115
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,709
I'm flattered.

116
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,041
I, too, am looking forward
to learning more about you.

117
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,834
There are aspects to Riva

118
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,166
of which we've not
been informed.

119
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,583
WOMAN:
<i>Precisely.</i>

120
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,333
<i>Our way of</i>
<i>communicating</i>

121
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,083
<i>has developed over</i>
<i>the centuries,</i>

122
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,750
<i>and it's one that I</i>
<i>find quite harmonious.</i>

123
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,667
Then Riva
the mediator...

124
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,041
<i>Is deaf.</i>

125
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,458
Deaf?

126
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,250
<i>Born and</i>
<i>hope to die.</i>

127
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,625
And the three of you
speak for him.

128
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,709
TOGETHER:
<i>Yes.</i>

129
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,458
<i>We serve as</i>
<i>translators.</i>

130
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,583
<i>We convey not only</i>
<i>his thoughts</i>

131
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,917
<i>but his emotional</i>
<i>intent as well.</i>

132
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,375
<i>I am the scholar.</i>

133
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,792
<i>I represent the intellect</i>

134
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,417
<i>and speak in matters</i>
<i>of judgment,</i>

135
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,208
<i>philosophy, logic.</i>

136
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,625
<i>Also, I am</i>
<i>the dreamer--</i>

137
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:13,125
<i>the part that longs to see</i>
<i>the beauty beyond the truth,</i>

138
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,125
<i>which is always the</i>
<i>first duty of art.</i>

139
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,667
<i>I am the poet who...</i>

140
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,291
<i>Artists-- they tend</i>
<i>to ramble,</i>

141
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,166
<i>neglect the moment.</i>

142
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,792
<i>I am passion,</i>
<i>the libido.</i>

143
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,834
<i>I am the</i>
<i>anarchy of lust.</i>

144
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,250
<i>The romantic...</i>

145
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,166
<i>and the lover.</i>

146
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,875
<i>I am also the warrior--</i>
<i>the perfect line</i>

147
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,750
<i>which never wavers.</i>

148
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:38,750
<i>I am that which binds</i>
<i>all the others together.</i>

149
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:42,750
<i>I am harmony, wisdom, balance.</i>

150
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:45,583
Remarkable.
And so, the--

151
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,083
WARRIOR:
<i>Speak to me!</i>

152
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,208
What?

153
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,166
<i>Speak directly to me.</i>

154
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:58,500
This unique form
of presentation

155
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:00,834
provoked this inadvertent
breach in protocol.

156
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,375
No insult was intended.

157
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,959
<i>Then none is perceived.</i>

158
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:09,917
I'm curious how this rare form
of communication came about.

159
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,500
<i>The gene for hearing</i>
<i>is not present</i>

160
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,500
<i>in my planet's ruling line.</i>

161
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:15,959
<i>Not that unusual.</i>

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,333
<i>Indeed, it is similar to</i>
<i>the House of Hanover</i>

163
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,083
<i>on your planet Earth,</i>
<i>all of whom had hemophilia.</i>

164
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,667
<i>Or to the leaders</i>
<i>of Fendaus V</i>

165
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,166
<i>who were without limbs.</i>

166
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,041
<i>Many of our galaxy's</i>
<i>greatest contributors</i>

167
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,458
<i>have been similarly special.</i>

168
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,000
SCHOLAR:
<i>My chorus is so attuned,</i>

169
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,500
<i>they can hear my thoughts</i>
<i>and translate to you.</i>

170
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:38,834
<i>It is a relationship that</i>
<i>goes back for centuries.</i>

171
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,583
<i>Their ancestors provided the</i>
<i>same service to</i> my<i> ancestors.</i>

172
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,250
Your method of
communication

173
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,333
is elegant and
quite beautiful.

174
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,333
WARRIOR:
<i>It takes a fine mind</i>

175
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,375
<i>to realize that,</i>
<i>Counselor Troi.</i>

176
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,667
This part of you doesn't
speak very often.

177
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:58,709
<i>Only when the</i>
<i>spirit moves me.</i>

178
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,417
Riva, if you're ready,

179
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,542
the situation on
Solais V is critical.

180
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,792
We should not delay.

181
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,250
SCHOLAR:
<i>Very well.</i>

182
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,583
With your
permission, Captain.

183
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,291
Make it so, Mr. Worf.

184
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,542
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is
the away team.

185
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,709
Seven to beam up.

186
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,250
TRANSPORTER CHIEF:
<i>Commander Riker, the away team</i>

187
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,625
<i>plus four is on board.</i>

188
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,166
Acknowledged.

189
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,583
Ensign, set your course
for Solais V.

190
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,625
Course is set.

191
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,083
Velocity warp 8.

192
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,375
Warp 8, aye.

193
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:42,417
Engage, Ensign.

194
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,709
Yes, sir.

195
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:03,917
What is this?

196
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,375
Riva is deaf.
These three speak for him.

197
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:09,291
Treat them
as interpreters.

198
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,041
Address yourselves
directly to Riva.

199
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,125
Now, may I present
my first officer...

200
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,166
SCHOLAR:
<i>First, Captain, may I say</i>

201
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,500
<i>it is an honor</i>

202
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,250
<i>to be on board</i>
<i>such a fine vessel.</i>

203
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:36,709
<i>Now please, continue</i>
<i>with the introductions.</i>

204
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,333
This is my first officer,
Commander Riker.

205
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:45,333
<i>It is an honor to meet you.</i>

206
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,875
Lieutenant
Commander Data.

207
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,583
<i>It is a pleasure</i>
<i>to meet such a...</i>

208
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,625
<i>unique individual.</i>

209
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,375
Thank you.

210
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:00,375
Lieutenant Geordi La Forge.

211
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:03,750
It is<i> my</i> pleasure
to meet you, sir.

212
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,834
<i>What is that</i>
<i>you're wearing?</i>

213
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,208
A visor-- it interprets
the electromagnetic spectrum

214
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,375
and then carries the readings
to my brain.

215
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:14,709
<i>And without it,</i>
<i>can you see?</i>

216
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,208
Without it, I'm as
blind as a stump.

217
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,709
<i>Then your visor serves</i>
<i>the same function</i>

218
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,166
<i>as my chorus, which</i>
<i>interprets my thoughts</i>

219
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,458
<i>and translates them</i>
<i>into sound.</i>

220
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Yes.

221
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,750
<i>And you don't resent it?</i>

222
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:32,792
The visor or being blind?

223
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,208
<i>Either.</i>

224
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,959
Well, no, since they're
both a part of me

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,625
and I really like who
I am there's no reason

226
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,583
for me to resent
either one.

227
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,750
<i>What is your position</i>
<i>on the ship?</i>

228
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,959
I'm the chief
engineer, sir.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,792
<i>It's a blessing to understand</i>
<i>that we are special,</i>

230
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,875
<i>each in his own way.</i>

231
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,125
Yes.

232
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,125
Yes, that's the way
I feel exactly.

233
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,875
I offer the hospitality
of my vessel,

234
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,542
and at your convenience,

235
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,333
there is a briefing
on the Solari wars.

236
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,834
If you wish, I'll have you
conducted to your quarters.

237
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,166
<i>Thank you.</i>

238
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,250
<i>Perhaps, if it is</i>
<i>not inconvenient,</i>

239
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:16,417
<i>Counselor Troi could escort me,</i>
<i>with your permission.</i>

240
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:25,917
This way.

241
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,125
What about you?

242
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,542
WOMAN:
At times like this,

243
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,458
we become an
encumbrance.

244
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,917
So, if you have rooms
for us...?

245
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,083
Lieutenant Worf

246
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,041
will escort you.

247
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,041
Riva's not what I expected.

248
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:01,625
<i>Much of what</i>
<i>we do is similar.</i>

249
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,208
Yes, I suppose
in a way it is.

250
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,625
<i>We have both learned</i>

251
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,709
<i>how to allow people</i>
<i>to examine feelings</i>

252
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,250
<i>hidden deep within</i>
<i>their psyche.</i>

253
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,542
<i>In fact...</i>

254
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,000
<i>being with you here</i>
<i>now is provoking</i>

255
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,375
<i>an emotional revelation.</i>

256
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:24,125
You mean, some emotion
buried deep within<i> your</i> psyche?

257
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,333
<i>Well, not that deep.</i>

258
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,208
Exactly what
are you feeling?

259
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,792
<i>Can't you tell?</i>

260
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:36,000
Some of it.

261
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,375
<i>Well, I feel that soon,</i>

262
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,417
<i>perhaps after the briefing</i>
<i>by your Captain,</i>

263
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,250
<i>that you will be hungry.</i>
<i>And that perhaps</i>

264
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:48,000
<i>we could dine together</i>
<i>and compare experiences.</i>

265
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,041
I'd like that.

266
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,583
<i>As will I.</i>

267
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,667
Will he be with us?

268
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,834
<i>Well, until we find our own</i>
<i>method of communication.</i>

269
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,125
I look forward to that time.

270
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,083
<i>As do I.</i>

271
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:16,083
I'm sorry, Data,
begin the briefing.

272
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,625
The factions on Solais V
are historical enemies.

273
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,917
So many have died
that both societies

274
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,583
are on the verge
of extinction.

275
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,250
<i>Enough.</i>

276
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,750
<i>Thank you, Captain, there</i>
<i>is no need to continue.</i>

277
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:31,000
<i>The specific issues of the</i>
<i>conflict have no relevance.</i>

278
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,667
So, none of the background
which we have provided

279
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,875
would be helpful
in understanding

280
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:37,333
why they continue to fight?

281
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,166
<i>The portfolio</i>
<i>will indicate</i>

282
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,542
<i>that the conflict is over</i>
<i>a piece of land or wealth,</i>

283
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,166
<i>or some other</i>
<i>tangible asset.</i>

284
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:48,125
<i>But we both know</i>
<i>that is not the case.</i>

285
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:52,458
They've been at war for so long,
it has become personal.

286
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,917
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>The basis for peace</i>

287
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:58,750
<i>must also be personal.</i>

288
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:03,667
<i>This is an historic</i>
<i>confrontation, correct?</i>

289
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,750
The factions have been
at war for 15 centuries.

290
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:11,083
<i>What's changed?</i>

291
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,083
I do not understand
what you mean.

292
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,542
<i>They have been killing</i>
<i>each other for a long time.</i>

293
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,000
<i>Now, they want to</i>
<i>talk peace.</i>

294
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,583
<i>So, something</i>
<i>about the situation</i>

295
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,875
<i>has recently changed.</i>

296
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:25,834
<i>What's the new piece</i>
<i>to the puzzle?</i>

297
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,125
Data?

298
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,125
Unknown, sir.

299
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,041
Perhaps they have run out
of people to kill.

300
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,208
In any case,
whatever the reason,

301
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,667
peace is now
preferred,

302
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:39,041
which should make
your job easier.

303
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,709
<i>Well, if not easier,</i>
<i>at least possible.</i>

304
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,166
<i>For now,</i>
<i>they are motivated.</i>

305
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,875
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

306
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:49,083
<i>I'll find something--</i>
<i>I always have.</i>

307
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,333
Always?

308
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,166
<i>To date, I have never failed.</i>

309
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,250
<i>Now, unless there is</i>
<i>something else...?</i>

310
00:17:56,291 --> 00:18:01,333
Um, no, this is entirely
for your benefit.

311
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,875
<i>Then thank you for</i>
<i>your time and effort.</i>

312
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,166
<i>I believe</i>
<i>I have to get ready</i>

313
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,375
<i>for a dinner</i>
<i>appointment.</i>

314
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,083
<i>If you will excuse me...</i>

315
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,875
Yes, of course.
The, uh...

316
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:23,250
The meeting
is adjourned.

317
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:28,208
Our mediator is
very self-assured.

318
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,917
We'll know soon enough
if he can deliver.

319
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:39,917
We're now approaching
Solais V.

320
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,250
Half impulse.

321
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,291
Slowing to
one-half impulse.

322
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:56,583
<i>The sound of this ship</i>
<i>is quite remarkable.</i>

323
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,792
<i>Can't you feel it?</i>

324
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,500
Yes.

325
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,542
<i>It moves through my body</i>
<i>like a great pulse.</i>

326
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,291
I've grown so accustomed to it,
I forget it's there.

327
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,500
<i>It's easy to let that happen.</i>

328
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:16,667
<i>Sometimes we must allow the</i>
<i>surroundings to flow over us.</i>

329
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:19,417
<i>To dwell on each</i>
<i>separate part.</i>

330
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,667
<i>How it feels.</i>

331
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:23,667
<i>To allow it</i>
<i>to fill you.</i>

332
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,583
How do we communicate?

333
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:40,291
I know you can read lips,
but I need your words...

334
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,458
Words...

335
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,583
are here on top.

336
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:54,208
What's under them...

337
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,875
their meaning...

338
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,667
...is what's important.

339
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,750
Yes, that's true.

340
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,959
We both
know...

341
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,834
...how to express...

342
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,667
important words... like...

343
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,583
..."dream."

344
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,083
"Being here
with you."

345
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,542
Yes.
Being here with you now

346
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,375
is very special to me, too.

347
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,291
Standard orbit.

348
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:07,041
Captain, I'm reading
laser activity on Solais V.

349
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,041
How concentrated
is the activity?

350
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,583
It is localized
but very intense.

351
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,166
So much for
the cease-fire.

352
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,959
Hailing frequencies.

353
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,041
I'm receiving
one side only.

354
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,542
This is Captain
Jean-Luc Picard,

355
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:27,583
Commander of the Federation
Starship USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

356
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:31,041
If you continue to
violate the cease-fire,

357
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,667
I will abort this mission.

358
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,125
You have no jurisdiction
here, Picard.

359
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,083
Where is Riva?

360
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,458
Riva is in charge
of the summit.

361
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,375
I command the ship
that brings him.

362
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:46,917
I will not endanger this
ship under any circumstances.

363
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:49,625
WORF: The other faction
is breaking through, sir.

364
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:53,250
Riva gave his word
we would speak to no one else.

365
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,583
Now, who breaks the rules?

366
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,417
Where is Riva?

367
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,417
I shall summon him.

368
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,125
Get Riva here.

369
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:06,875
RIKER: Counselor Troi, please
have Riva report to the Bridge.

370
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:11,291
They need you on
the Bridge. Now.

371
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,959
The cease-fire
has been broken.

372
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,625
<i>I'm sure I can</i>
<i>resolve that.</i>

373
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,000
<i>Put them on the viewscreen.</i>

374
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,709
Viewer on.

375
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:42,291
The quality of the transmission
is very poor.

376
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,500
<i>It is sufficient.</i>

377
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,458
<i>Brothers...</i>

378
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,959
<i>your bravery as</i>
<i>fighters is known.</i>

379
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,625
<i>Now, you must demonstrate</i>
<i>courage in a new way.</i>

380
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:01,375
<i>Cease hostilities.</i>

381
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:03,667
<i>Allow us to meet.</i>

382
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,125
(<i> muttering</i> )

383
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,208
(<i> rapid beeping</i> )

384
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,542
The laser fire has ceased.

385
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,750
For how long?

386
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:22,458
These Solari don't seem
likely candidates for peace.

387
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,834
<i>I will need to see a</i>
<i>topographical overlay</i>

388
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,917
<i>of the battle area in order</i>
<i>to pick a site</i>

389
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:35,041
<i>for the meetings.</i>

390
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:39,417
<i>Then, I will need your help</i>
<i>in creating the proper setting.</i>

391
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,750
Worf, prepare
your security team.

392
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:43,458
Yes, sir.

393
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,375
<i>That's not necessary.</i>

394
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,250
But it is prudent.

395
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,750
<i>I prefer to arrive</i>

396
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,375
<i>with the smallest</i>
<i>possible complement.</i>

397
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:54,625
<i>We do not want to add to an</i>
<i>already tense situation.</i>

398
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,750
If that is your
judgment, so be it.

399
00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:00,417
We're here to provide whatever
service you require.

400
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,750
<i>Thank you, Captain.</i>

401
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,000
<i>There.</i>

402
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,417
<i>Beam us down to that hilltop</i>

403
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,875
<i>and inform the</i>
<i>factions to join us.</i>

404
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:21,583
<i>The time for killing</i>
<i>has come to an end.</i>

405
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,166
Phasers on stun,
Mr. Worf.

406
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,625
<i>You won't need those.</i>

407
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:49,500
I'm sure we won't.
Energize.

408
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:18,417
<i>Yes, this will do.</i>

409
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,625
<i>It is important that</i>
<i>we set this up properly.</i>

410
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:23,959
<i>Commander?</i>

411
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,792
<i>If it is possible,</i>

412
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,291
<i>I would like</i>
<i>torches here...</i>

413
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,709
<i>and here.</i>

414
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,417
Engineering,
this is the away team.

415
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:37,709
Yes, Commander?

416
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,500
RIKER: We<i> are</i> going to
need your help.

417
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:41,208
I thought you might.

418
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,041
We would like two
torches-- head high?

419
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,500
And what else?

420
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:48,709
<i>A table... here.</i>

421
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,959
Describe it.

422
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,834
<i>Three-sided,</i>
<i>and if possible,</i>

423
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,208
<i>made to resemble</i>
<i>indigenous rock.</i>

424
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,667
RIKER:
Did you read that, Geordi?

425
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:58,208
I did. That should
be no problem.

426
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,709
When will the
Emissaries arrive?

427
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,333
<i>Well, it shouldn't be</i>
<i>too long.</i>

428
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:06,083
And how long do you think
the negotiations will take?

429
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:08,583
<i>They won't go quickly.</i>

430
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,959
(<i> rattling</i> )

431
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
They're coming, Commander.

432
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,709
<i>The first few minutes</i>
<i>will be very tense.</i>

433
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,291
<i>Please, stay calm,</i>

434
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:22,709
<i>and do not respond,</i>
<i>even if you are provoked.</i>

435
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,333
We'll do our best.

436
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:35,166
(<i> whispering</i> )

437
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,333
Who is Riva?

438
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,208
<i>I am Riva.</i>

439
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:52,000
(<i> snarling</i> )

440
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,041
(<i> grunting</i> )

441
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,000
<i>Be at ease.</i>

442
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,500
<i>I commend you both.</i>

443
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:11,792
<i>To come here</i>
<i>proves not only</i>

444
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:14,041
<i>your courage,</i>
<i>but your wisdom.</i>

445
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:18,041
<i>Please, give this</i>
<i>conference a chance.</i>

446
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:20,709
<i>I have no magic.</i>

447
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,875
<i>You have been fighting</i>
<i>all your lives.</i>

448
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:25,208
<i>You have known only...</i>

449
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,500
No! No, never!

450
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:28,291
Never! Death first!

451
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,417
Riva!

452
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:31,041
Death!

453
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:35,792
Don't! Traitor!

454
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,291
No, wait.

455
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,792
Wait.

456
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:42,375
RIKER: Away team
to<i> Enterprise.</i>

457
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:43,834
Beam us up now.

458
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,333
His words are not mine.

459
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,125
Please, Riva.

460
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:56,041
We need you.
We need you!

461
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,834
How did this happen?

462
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,333
RIKER:
A total surprise.

463
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,083
Apparently a member
of one of the factions

464
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,583
didn't like the
idea of peace.

465
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,333
I don't understand what
you're trying to say.

466
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,917
Counselor.

467
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,125
Riva, go slowly.

468
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,250
Slowly.

469
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,000
Can you write it out?

470
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,834
I am so sorry that your
friends were killed.

471
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:48,875
I'm sorry,
I-I don't know

472
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:51,041
what you are
trying to tell me.

473
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:55,834
We have to find some way
to communicate with him.

474
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:58,208
Data, he knows some kind
of gestural language.

475
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,375
Find out which one
and learn it.

476
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,583
DATA:
Aye, sir.

477
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:01,709
Counselor, take
him to Sick Bay.

478
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,333
Maybe Pulaski can help.

479
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,250
Listen to me!
You are not alone!

480
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:09,792
Do you understand?

481
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:15,041
We are all in this
together... now.

482
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,625
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

483
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:45,750
<i>We are monitoring increased</i>
<i>military activity on Solais V.</i>

484
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,750
<i>I fear that without Riva</i>

485
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,875
<i>we will be unable</i>
<i>to keep the Solari</i>

486
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:52,750
<i>from destroying themselves.</i>

487
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,000
How's it going?

488
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,417
I have eliminated
all but five

489
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,250
distinct forms
of signing.

490
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,041
I will learn them all.

491
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:02,125
Computer, show me
gestural language

492
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:04,417
designation M-9.

493
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:08,792
WORF:
Very interesting.

494
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:10,625
A technique
of communication

495
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:13,333
that is both silent
and covert.

496
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,125
It could be
very useful.

497
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:17,625
The use of gestures
and hand signals

498
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:20,250
predates the spoken word
in most cultures--

499
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:22,792
the major exception being
the Leyrons of Malkus IX,

500
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:25,709
who actually developed a
written language first.

501
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,417
Computer,

502
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,458
continue presentation.

503
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,583
Increase.

504
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,542
Increase.

505
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:40,458
Increase.

506
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,500
(<i> door chimes</i> )

507
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,041
Come.

508
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:50,917
How's our mediator?

509
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:53,250
The same.
He's withdrawn.

510
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,917
He's very frightened.

511
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,917
All of his life
he's been in control,

512
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,500
and now, for the
first time,

513
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:01,166
he doesn't have any answers.

514
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:04,709
The doctor gave him
a complete medical examination.

515
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,375
His condition is hereditary.

516
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:10,583
His brain can't receive
auditory information.

517
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,750
So, all the prosthetics
and surgical techniques

518
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:15,709
I can use
wouldn't work.

519
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,041
I don't know what we can do
to help him.

520
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,417
I can't do anything.

521
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:24,583
It's up to him,
and he's stopped cooperating.

522
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,625
Counselor,
couldn't you...?

523
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:30,375
Confidence is faith in oneself.

524
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:32,834
It can't easily be
given by another.

525
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,375
Huh.

526
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:39,083
You're right, of course.

527
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,208
(<i> door chimes</i> )

528
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,417
Come.

529
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,709
Captain, I have
reviewed and stored

530
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,792
five distinct
signing languages.

531
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:50,917
Here is an example
of the first.

532
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,959
This is blue.

533
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,667
This is the blue ocean.

534
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:56,500
This is the blue ocean
at sunset.

535
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,041
This is two people

536
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,333
walking along the beach by
the blue ocean at sunset.

537
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,959
This is two happy
people in love

538
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
walking along the beach

539
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,583
by the blue ocean
at sunset.

540
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,250
This is two pe--
Enough.

541
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:15,667
Let's talk to Riva.

542
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,792
Riva.

543
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:24,250
Riva, Commander Data has
learned your sign language.

544
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:25,583
Talk to us.

545
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,709
DATA:
It was my fault.

546
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,750
I am responsible
for their deaths.

547
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:37,000
In my arrogance,
I thought no one

548
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:39,500
could possibly harm
the great Riva.

549
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,375
I am such a fool.

550
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:45,333
You are not to blame.

551
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,625
What happened
appears to have been

552
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,500
the work of one
desperate man.

553
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:52,917
It may not reflect the
feelings of the others.

554
00:32:56,667 --> 00:33:00,125
DATA: They were more
than my interpreters.

555
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,458
They were also
my friends.

556
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,875
They were a part of me.

557
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:08,709
I did not realize
how much a part...

558
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,291
until now.

559
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,542
We have been contacted

560
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:16,250
by the factions
on Solais.

561
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:19,458
They want to
renew negotiations.

562
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,333
DATA: I cannot.
I will not.

563
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,333
Don't turn away.

564
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,125
You have a chance
to make some good

565
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,041
come out of
this tragedy.

566
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:34,333
This could be the catalyst
which binds them together.

567
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:37,208
Someone else will have to
speak with them, not me.

568
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,166
Not after what
I allowed to happen.

569
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,375
How could I?

570
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:42,709
But Data
understands you.

571
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,709
Use him, let him
explain your words.

572
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,709
When Data speaks for me,

573
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,625
can you hear my-my
anguish, my despair?

574
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,875
Data is a fine machine,

575
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:58,208
but he cannot take
the place of my chorus.

576
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:02,500
It took years to develop
a communication.

577
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:05,208
That cannot be
easily replaced.

578
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:09,125
The Solari need you.

579
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,667
I cannot help them.

580
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:15,750
Captain, please take
me back to Ramatis.

581
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,709
That is regrettable.

582
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,834
A lot more people
are going to die.

583
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:31,208
It's possible to
install optical devices

584
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,083
which look like
normal eyes

585
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,834
and would
still give you

586
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,834
about the same
visual range

587
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:42,083
as the visor.

588
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,959
Done?

589
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,625
You say almost.

590
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,291
How much reduction?

591
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,875
20%.

592
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:52,834
Hmm.

593
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:57,583
There's another option.

594
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:00,208
I could attempt
to regenerate

595
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,083
your optic nerve,

596
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,166
and with the help
of the replicator,

597
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,625
fashion normal eyes.

598
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,166
You would see
like everyone else.

599
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:10,125
Wait a minute, I was told
that wasn't possible.

600
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,792
I've done it twice

601
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:14,875
in situations somewhat
similar to yours.

602
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:27,542
Geordi, it would eliminate

603
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,834
the constant pain
you are under.

604
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,792
Why are you hesitating?

605
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:35,000
Well, when I
came to see you,

606
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,250
it was to talk about
modifying<i> this.</i>

607
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,875
And now, you're saying
it could be possible

608
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,834
for me to have
normal vision?

609
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,792
Yes.

610
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,458
I don't know.

611
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,792
I'd be giving up a lot.

612
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:52,083
There's something else
you must know.

613
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,792
This is a one-shot.

614
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:55,208
If you decide to
change your mind,

615
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,583
there's no going back.

616
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:59,417
And there are risks.

617
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:02,875
I can offer choices,
not guarantees.

618
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,041
Well...

619
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:12,166
this, uh... this is
a lot to think about.

620
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:16,041
I'll, uh, I'll get
back to you, Doctor.

621
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,083
Thank you.

622
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,250
Captain is going to take
you back to Ramatis.

623
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:48,792
But first, he's
given me permission

624
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,834
to attempt to settle
the conflict

625
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,875
down on Solais.

626
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:54,375
Yes.

627
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:57,375
We've come so far and
paid such a terrible price.

628
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:59,709
I must try.

629
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,709
Help me.

630
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,083
DATA:
You would be better off

631
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:05,709
without my help.

632
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,792
I have never attempted
anything like this before.

633
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:11,083
When dealing
with two factions

634
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:13,000
so diametrically
opposed,

635
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:15,208
so entrenched
in their positions,

636
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,208
where do you start?

637
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,500
You want to know if I had
some special technique?

638
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:26,667
I want to know anything you
can tell me which could help.

639
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:29,166
DATA: There is
no... no trick.

640
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,959
I had no magic.

641
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,208
What about your chorus?

642
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:39,250
DATA: Yes, my chorus
was special.

643
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:44,291
They allowed me to combine
different perceptions.

644
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,667
So, there was a trick.

645
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,250
DATA:
Not really.

646
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:51,417
My technique

647
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,250
was to look for some thing,

648
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:56,542
no matter...
no matter how small,

649
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:59,125
that was common to both groups

650
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:03,417
and then to begin a process
where one person or one group

651
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,792
expresses themselves
to each other.

652
00:38:05,834 --> 00:38:08,333
That's very hard
to accomplish.

653
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:09,417
Yes.

654
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,417
But what is even
more difficult

655
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:14,959
is to get each
side to listen--

656
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,166
really listen to
each other--

657
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:22,291
and to understand.

658
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:27,083
This isn't going to be
easy for me.

659
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:34,291
You are very good with people.

660
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:37,417
But what I do
is different.

661
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:46,875
DATA: The real
secret is turning

662
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:51,166
disadvantage
into advantage.

663
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,458
Why can't you do that?

664
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,750
Why can't you turn
your disadvantage

665
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:00,542
into an advantage?

666
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,917
DATA:
That is interesting.

667
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:16,291
That would give them
something in common.

668
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,166
I do not understand,
Counselor.

669
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:20,208
To what is he referring?

670
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,375
Thank you.

671
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:39,041
Thank me? Ah.

672
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,875
I will have the Captain
contact them down on the planet

673
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:49,000
and tell them to prepare
for your return.

674
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:06,875
There are no life signs
in the immediate area.

675
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:08,375
All right, stay sharp.

676
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:10,792
We may have to get out of there
in a hurry.

677
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:15,667
Set phasers on stun.

678
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,125
Energize.

679
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,083
The area is clear,
Commander.

680
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,166
Put the table over there.

681
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:00,792
Engineering,
this is Commander Riker.

682
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,291
LA FORGE:
Go ahead, sir.

683
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:04,792
You can beam the table
and torches down now.

684
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,083
Light the torches

685
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,375
to let them know
that I am back.

686
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,417
It may be quite a while
before the Emissaries arrive.

687
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:32,667
They'll be more cautious
after the last incident.

688
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:37,000
DATA: You may leave
whenever you choose.

689
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,542
I will send out a message
when I am ready to go.

690
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:43,000
Deanna, I don't understand
what he's going to do.

691
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,750
How can he mediate
without his interpreters?

692
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:47,083
He won't even be able
to talk to them.

693
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,125
Riva is going to teach
them sign language.

694
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,375
DATA:
Yes.

695
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,250
It is turning
a disadvantage

696
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:54,750
into an advantage.

697
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:56,750
Learning sign

698
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:59,542
will be a part
of their process

699
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,166
of learning how to live
together in peace.

700
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:05,542
While they are learning how
to communicate with Riva,

701
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:08,542
they'll be learning how to
communicate with each other.

702
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:12,458
DATA: And that is the first
and most important aspect

703
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,667
of any relationship.

704
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:18,166
Counselor, it took me only
moments to learn sign language.

705
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:20,458
It will take
them months.

706
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,375
Time well spent.

707
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,417
DATA: These people have been
fighting all of their lives.

708
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:30,417
They know only hatred,
suspicion and fear.

709
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,458
Even with my chorus,

710
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,709
I could not have changed
their attitudes in a day.

711
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,000
We have a chance.

712
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:43,625
They want these talks
to be successful.

713
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,333
Well, I am still
not comfortable

714
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,959
leaving you here alone.

715
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:49,834
DATA: Thank you
for your concern.

716
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:52,125
I will be fine.

717
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:59,250
And thank you...
for everything.

718
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,542
<i>Enterprise,</i> four to beam up.

719
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,208
Good luck.

720
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:37,208
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42479.3.</i>

721
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,875
<i>We leave the Solais system</i>

722
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:40,917
<i>confident that Riva</i>
<i>will help the Solari</i>

723
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:43,875
<i>achieve a lasting peace.</i>

724
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:45,875
WESLEY: Coordinates set,
Commander.

725
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:48,041
Take us out of orbit.

726
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,792
(<i> door chimes</i> )

727
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,208
Come.

728
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:59,083
You wanted to see me?

729
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,583
Yes.

730
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:05,417
You read me
well enough

731
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:08,583
to sense how I
feel about you

732
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,333
and what you do
on this ship.

733
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:13,750
But I just wanted
to say the words.

734
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:17,959
Thank you.
Well done.
