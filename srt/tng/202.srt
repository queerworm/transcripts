1
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:34,417
You're worried.

2
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,375
With reason.

3
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,083
About Worf
or Commander Riker?

4
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,875
Both.

5
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,834
I think it is perhaps best
to be ignorant

6
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:49,917
of certain elements
of Klingon psyche.

7
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,583
(<i> mysterious animal noises</i> )

8
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,166
(<i> crackling</i> )

9
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:20,208
(<i> growling</i> )

10
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,625
Above!
Look out!

11
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,375
(<i> clanging</i> )

12
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,917
The exercise is over!

13
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:52,625
(<i> snarling</i> )

14
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:54,959
(<i> yells</i> )

15
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,333
At ease, Lieutenant!

16
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,333
Exit holodeck.

17
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,625
You do this every day?

18
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,125
No, Commander.

19
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,500
Usually my calisthenics
are more...

20
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,000
intense.

21
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,250
But those sessions are
too personal to be shared.

22
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,208
I'll bet they are.

23
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,625
Computer, program
complete. Save.

24
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,792
(<i> computer beeping</i> )

25
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:42,750
Coming, Commander?

26
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,542
Right behind you.

27
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:16,375
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

28
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:20,667
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

29
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,208
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

30
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:26,333
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

31
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:30,959
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

32
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,709
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

33
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:35,333
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42193.6.</i>

34
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,458
<i>We're on a long reach</i>
<i>toward the Morgana quadrant</i>

35
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,083
<i>a section of the galaxy which</i>
<i>has yet to be visited</i>

36
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,333
<i>by a manned</i>

37
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,125
<i>We are using</i>

38
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,542
<i>the charts of</i>

39
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,000
(<i> beeping</i> )

40
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,250
There it is again, sir,
an area of blackness.

41
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,792
It appears, it disappears,
and then it reappears.

42
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,750
There's no predictable pattern,
no sequence.

43
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,959
On screen.

44
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,208
There it is.

45
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:17,417
I can't see anything.

46
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:19,834
Um...

47
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,959
Magnify section 285.

48
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,667
WESLEY:
There it is, sir.

49
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:31,834
It's... like a hole in space.

50
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,792
Well, we're acquainted
with the wormhole phenomenon

51
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:36,625
but this...

52
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,542
this appears quite different.

53
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,583
What do your
sensors indicate?

54
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,625
Nothing, sir.

55
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,291
Nothing?

56
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,417
Mr. Data, you must mean
that it's empty of matter.

57
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,750
There's always some
energy form at work.

58
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,125
Sir, our sensors
are showing this

59
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,792
to be the absence
of everything.

60
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,125
It is a void
without matter

61
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,291
or energy
of any kind.

62
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,917
Yet, this hole
has a form, Data.

63
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,333
It has height, width...

64
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,625
Perhaps.

65
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,041
Perhaps not, sir.

66
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,208
That's hardly a scientific
observation, Commander.

67
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:11,417
Captain, the most elementary and
valuable statement in science

68
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:12,750
the beginning of wisdom is

69
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,792
"I do not know."

70
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:18,250
I do not know
what that is, sir.

71
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,834
Captain, if this were any

72
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:26,291
ordinary kind of hole in space
wouldn't we be able

73
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,834
to see what's behind it?

74
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,375
Counselor?

75
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,041
I know what
you're asking

76
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,750
but I feel nothing
from it.

77
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,333
Data, is there any
record anywhere

78
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,333
of any occurrence even
vaguely similar to this?

79
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,250
Accessing.

80
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,834
Negative, sir.

81
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:49,000
There is no record of any
Federation vessel encountering

82
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,500
anything remotely
like this.

83
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Indeed.

84
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,792
I believe we have time to take
a closer look, Number One.

85
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,792
Concur.

86
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,333
Ensign, slow down
to half-impulse power.

87
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,500
Adjust coordinates
to intercept this...

88
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,041
whatever this is.

89
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,792
Scanning and recording as we go.

90
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,125
WESLEY:
Aye, sir.

91
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,625
Adjusting course to intercept
in 12 minutes.

92
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,792
Let's launch a probe into it.

93
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,333
Worf, prepare
scanner probe.

94
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,417
Let's see what's in there.

95
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,625
This is close
enough, Ensign.

96
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,917
Hold this position.

97
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,917
Aye, sir,
holding this position.

98
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,792
You may fire the probe
when ready, Mr. Worf.

99
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:41,792
All the probe's systems
are functioning perfectly, sir.

100
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,917
It's gone.

101
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,834
Data, what happened?

102
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,500
Unknown, sir.

103
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,208
Recommend we go
to yellow alert, sir.

104
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,250
Why?

105
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:59,417
Explain.

106
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,542
Sorry, sir, it's...

107
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,125
Mr. Worf

108
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,750
this starship operates best

109
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,291
when my officers share with me
what is on their minds.

110
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:14,959
My thoughts
were of an old Klingon legend

111
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,583
of... a gigantic,
black space creature

112
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,709
which was said to devour
entire vessels.

113
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:26,125
<i>Devour</i> vessels?

114
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,709
Sorry, Commander.

115
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,417
I agree these are thoughts
hardly worthy of a trained

116
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:34,542
and practical
Security Officer.

117
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,500
Mr. Worf

118
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,000
will you launch
another probe--

119
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,750
this time a class 1
with full sensor array.

120
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,000
Launching, sir.

121
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,417
Happened
even more quickly.

122
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,667
Recommend we fire
photon torpedo, Captain.

123
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,083
Negative.

124
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,917
Captain, based on where
the probes disappeared

125
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,291
I've been able to plot
the outer boundaries.

126
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,500
I could move
in closer.

127
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,917
Make it so, Mr. Crusher.

128
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,458
Thrusters only.

129
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,333
Mr. Data?

130
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,083
Still no readings
of any kind, sir.

131
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,250
Number One?

132
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,166
I'm going to go with Worf
on this one.

133
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,500
Let's be careful.

134
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,959
All right, that's enough,
Ensign.

135
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,250
Come to full stop,
and hold these coordinates.

136
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,542
Aye, sir.

137
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,291
(<i> whoosh</i> )

138
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,709
What's happened?

139
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,834
Data?

140
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,917
Whatever it is, sir,
we seem to be inside it.

141
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,458
RIKER:
It enveloped us.

142
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,500
It moved.

143
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,917
All stations, report.

144
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,750
DATA:
No response,
Captain.

145
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,083
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

146
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,667

00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,792

<i>After a brief disruption</i>

151
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:29,583
<i>our ship's communications</i>

152
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,166
All stations
have reported, Captain.

153
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,291
There appears to be
no immediate threat

154
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,917
to the ship or the crew.

155
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:36,083
Let's hold this position
for awhile, Number One.

156
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,125
This is worth studying.

157
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,500
RIKER:
Incredible.

158
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,125
It's like looking
into infinity, sir.

159
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,208
Remember the course
in ancient history

160
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,875
at Starfleet Academy?

161
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,709
About the time when men still
believed the Earth was flat?

162
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,917
Mm, and that the sun
revolved around it.

163
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:54,125
And that if a ship sailed
too far out into the ocean

164
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,417
it would fall off
the edge of the world?

165
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,458
"Beyond this place
there be dragons."

166
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,959
It's even said that
crews threatened

167
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,166
to hang their captain
from the yardarm

168
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,041
if he refused to turn back.

169
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,542
I'm sure no one here
has that in mind, sir.

170
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,250
How comforting, Number One.

171
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,709
WESLEY:
Captain?

172
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:20,083
We have no communications
outside of the void.

173
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,709
Complete your scans, Data.

174
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,458
Let's not stay any longer
than we have to.

175
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,583
PICARD:
Hello, Doctor.

176
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,500
Have you been briefed
on what's happened?

177
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,417
I heard, but I don't
understand it, Captain.

178
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:33,959
I wish I could say I did.

179
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,917
Increase magnification by ten.

180
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,834
By 100.

181
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,792
PULASKI:
Isn't this
impossible, sir?

182
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,792
I'm not a Bridge
Officer, but...

183
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:56,041
Increase by 1,000, Mr. Data.

184
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,041
By 10,000.

185
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:11,500
It does know how to do
these things, doesn't it?

186
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,792
Commander Data knows
precisely what he is doing.

187
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,542
Forgive me, Mr. Data.

188
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:23,750
I'm not accustomed to working
with nonliving devices that...

189
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,959
Forgive me again.

190
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:29,250
Your service record says
that you are alive

191
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,250
and I must accept that.

192
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:33,917
Engineering.

193
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,375
LA FORGE:
Engineering.

194
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,000
Lieutenant,
are all your
systems functioning?

195
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,500
Yes, Captain.

196
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,083
Wherever we are
it seems to have no effect

197
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,000
on engineering.

198
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,208
Thank you,
Lieutenant. Data?

199
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,667
Difficult to make
a judgment, sir

200
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,834
based on the absence
of information.

201
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:49,250
Speculate.

202
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,625
This void has a total lack
of dimension.

203
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,208
Therefore, by any accepted
standard, it does not exist

204
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:59,959
yet being within it
denies that conclusion.

205
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,250
Might we have moved
into another dimension?

206
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,250
Could a lack of dimension
be another dimension in itself?

207
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,750
That's an interesting question.

208
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,333
Mm, yeah,
for a later discussion.

209
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

210
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,583
Number One, I think we should
get on with our mission.

211
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,625
Starfleet can send
a science vessel back

212
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,750
to investigate this further.

213
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,917
Move us back out of here.

214
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:24,583
Aye, sir.

215
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,500
Wesley,
reverse our direction.

216
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,625
Set a course
for the Cornelian star system.

217
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,834
Impulse power.

218
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:30,834
Aye, sir.

219
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,667
Reversing direction.

220
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,125
Course laid in.

221
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:37,250
Engage.

222
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,875
Our engines have engaged,
haven't they, Ensign?

223
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,083
Aye, sir.

224
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,542
PICARD:
Lieutenant La Forge

225
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,667
I'd like you to monitor
our velocity closely.

226
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,625
Is everything all right
up there, Captain?

227
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,375
Are the engines
operating normally?

228
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes, sir, everything looks fine
down here.

229
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,417
We're increasing to warp two.

230
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:46,542
Aye, sir.

231
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,625
We should be seeing stars
by now.

232
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,500
Data, how far have we come?

233
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,000
Inertial guidance shows
1.4 parsecs traveled, Captain.

234
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,291
Ensign?

235
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,625
Confirmed, sir.

236
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,208
Exactly what my readings say.

237
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:22,834
Engineering, transfer to Bridge.

238
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,041
What's happening, sir?

239
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,208
We should be clear.

240
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,291
We should be.

241
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,417
We're on a reverse course.

242
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:28,667
Full stop, helm.

243
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:31,041
WESLEY:
Full stop, sir.

244
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,208
According to this

245
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,417
we're already well
past the point

246
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,291
at which we
entered the void.

247
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,625
Except that
we are still in it, sir.

248
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,917
Captain...

249
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,792
if we dropped
a stationary beacon

250
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,417
and traveled straight away
from it

251
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,000
we would have a fixed point
of reference to confirm

252
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,709
speed and
distance.

253
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:48,834
Make it so, Data.

254
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,834
Lock onto the beacon.

255
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,333
Keep it dead astern.

256
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,417
(<i> rhythmic chiming</i> )

257
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:56,750
The beacon is in place, sir.

258
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,959
Dead ahead. Impulse power.

259
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,250
The beacon is falling astern,
Captain.

260
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,333
Engineering, report.

261
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,500
All systems functioning
normally, sir.

262
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,000
Prepare to increase to warp two.

263
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,458
Aye, sir.

264
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:17,166
(<i> chiming fading,</i>
<i>lowering in pitch</i> )

265
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:30,875
Captain, we are
receiving a signal
from dead ahead.

266
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,542
Maybe you found the
door out of this.

267
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,500
Closing on the
new signal, sir.

268
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,208
Identify.

269
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,375
(<i> chiming getting louder,</i>
<i>rising in pitch</i> )

270
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,417
Captain, it is the
stationary beacon

271
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,417
we just released.

272
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,583
We must have come
full circle, sir.

273
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,417
We couldn't have, sir.

274
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,959
I've shown us moving steadily
away from that beacon.

275
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,417
PICARD:
Full stop.

276
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:52,917
Hold this position
again.

277
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,709
(<i> chiming stops</i> )

278
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,834
(<i> fast beeping</i> )

279
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:05,375
Captain, sensors indicate
a disturbance in sector 1-0-8.

280
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,041
possibly a vessel.

281
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,542
Perhaps some answers at last.

282
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:09,709
On screen.

283
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,291
The ship is equipped
with a cloaking device.

284
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,041
Romulan.

285
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,166
WORF:
It's closing.

286
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,750
Shields up.
Go to red alert.

287
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,208
I'll be at
my duty station.

288
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,000
WORF:
Main viewer locked
onto coordinates.

289
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,750
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

290
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,792
Arm the photon torpedoes,
Mr. Worf.

291
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,458
Hold for my orders.

292
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,667
There!

293
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,000
WORF:
It's uncloaking.

294
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,750
Direct hit, sir.

295
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,291
Our shields are weakening.

296
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,250
Warn them we'll return fire.

297
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,583
Transmitting.

298
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,667
They've armed another
full spread, sir.

299
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:49,834
Fire torpedoes.

300
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,542
Yeah!

301
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,417
Oh, that was too easy.

302
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:09,291
Captain, our sensors
show no debris

303
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,500
from the Romulan vessel.

304
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,750
Impossible.

305
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,583
Captain, there's another
vessel approaching

306
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,875
in sector 0-9-1
mark 2-6.

307
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,583
On screen.

308
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,834
PICARD:
Magnify.

309
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:28,125
It's a Federation ship,
NCC 1305-e.

310
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,208
It's the<i> Yamato,</i>
our sister ship.

311
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,041
The<i> Yamato's</i> nowhere near
this quadrant.

312
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,667
Open a hailing frequency, Data.

313
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:40,208

to USS<i> Yamato.</i>

314
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,750
Respond, please.

316
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,667
Respond, please,
on this frequency.

317
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,041
No response, Captain.

318
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,500
Make a full scan.

319
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,959
Life-support system,
engineering

320
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:02,291
and propulsion
all appear functional

321
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,625
but there are
no life signs, sir.

322
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,208
Data, can we be getting
a false reading?

323
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,834
Since we know nothing
of these circumstances

324
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,208
that is at least
conceivable, sir.

325
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,625
You look doubtful, sir.

326
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,000
Hmm?

327
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,500
Oh, I'm not anything
right now, Number one.

328
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,208
I'm just a man
who's looking for answers.

329
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,417
LA FORGE:
Like the rat said

330
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:32,166
"Keep the cheese.

331
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,875
I just want out of the trap."

332
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,875
Captain, request permission

333
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,125
to board onto the<i> Yamato</i>
with an away team.

334
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,875
Perhaps something
we could find onboard

335
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,166
would help us figure out
what happened.

336
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,750
Granted,
minimal complement.

337
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,375
Worf, you're with me.

338
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,417
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

339
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:58,750
<i>We remain, like a fly in amber,</i>
<i>trapped in the void.</i>

340
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,208
<i>We have encountered a vessel</i>

341
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,542
<i>which appears to be</i>
<i>the USS</i> Yamato.

342
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,959
<i>All its systems are shown</i>
<i>as functioning</i>

343
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,083
<i>yet it seems devoid of life.</i>

344
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,000
<i>Commander Riker is leading</i>
<i>an away team.</i>

345
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,625
<i>Hopefully,</i>
<i>the answer lies over there.</i>

346
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,000
Have you got a lock
on that other ship?

347
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,083
Aye, sir,
no problems at all.

348
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,166
Can you put us
on the Bridge?

349
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,625
Anywhere you say,
Commander.

350
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,417
I am acquainted with
the<i> Yamato,</i> Commander.

351
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:21,709
Recommend the aft
station of their Bridge.

352
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:24,250
When in doubt,
surprise them.

353
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,792
Them? Who's them?

354
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,375
Whoever may be there.

355
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,875
Our sensors indicate
no life-forms.

356
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,875
Still, the tactic
is sound.

357
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,000
Agreed.

358
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,625

00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,917
This isn't the Bridge.

364
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:58,792
Worf?

365
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:00,667
(<i> screeching howl</i> )

366
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,500
(<i> howling</i> )

367
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,083
(<i> screaming</i> )

368
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,709
Ho! Don't fire!

369
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,125
I heard you screaming.

370
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,458
I was coming
to help.

371
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,625
You heard me?

372
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,000
I heard you.

373
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,625
Transporter Chief,
where do you show us over here?

374
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,917
(<i> staticky</i> ):
We show...

375
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:52,417
(<i> static fades out</i> )

376
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,625
Captain, do you read me?

377
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:59,208
RIKER:
We're having difficulty
with our communications...

378
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:03,542
Number One, come in.

379
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,959
Transporter Room,
this is the Captain.

380
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,667
We're out of contact
with the away team.

381
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:09,333
Beam them back immediately.

382
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,917
I've lost the lock on them.

383
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:18,333
Nothing on my
communicator, sir.

384
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,125
Computer on.

385
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,000
Let's find a turbolift
to the Bridge.

386
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:28,208
Transporter Room, have you
been able to establish a lock?

387
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,875
COMPUTER:
Emergency power engaged.

388
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,208
Initiate full check,
all systems.

389
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,667
LA FORGE:
Engineering
section, report.

390
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:39,500
What is our situation?

391
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,542
Engineering?

392
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:46,500
Captain, request permission
to leave the Bridge.

393
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,792
Granted.

394
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:57,500
This isn't
a Federation ship.

395
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,083
These walls aren't tritanium.

396
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,959
It's close, but it's a material
beyond our technology.

397
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,500
Let's get to the Bridge.

398
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,875
There's got to be an answer
to all of this somewhere.

399
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:20,417
This Bridge should be
four decks above us.

400
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:21,834
What's going on here?

401
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:31,208
That's not where
we came from.

402
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:34,083
Wait a minute.

403
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,667
Two Bridges?

404
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:39,792
If we go through there,
where will we be?

405
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:41,041
On the Bridge.

406
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,792
But we<i> are</i> on the Bridge.

407
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,333
It's up to you, sir.

408
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,750
Let's see what happens.

409
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:08,333
Is it the same Bridge?

410
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:13,166
Or did we step
from one Bridge...

411
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,458
onto another Bridge?

412
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:28,917
(<i> beeping</i> )

413
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,709
We've regained ship's
communication, sir.

414
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:32,250
Captain,
I have a star fix.

415
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,667
On screen.

416
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:36,208
HASKELL:
It's an
opening, sir.

417
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,208
Confirm, sir,
navigation is
possible.

418
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,500
Should I set a course?

419
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,709
Transporter Room

420
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:41,959
do you have a fix
on the away team?

421
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,500
Negative, Captain.

422
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,333
Damn.

423
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,333
Sir!

424
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,709
WORF:
Commander.

425
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:11,333
How did you...?

426
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,208
Where did you come from?

427
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:15,250
What's going on?

428
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,458
A ship has one Bridge.

429
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:18,875
One Bridge!

430
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,125
One Riker, one Bridge!

431
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,834
(<i> growling</i> )

432
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,417
(<i> speaking Klingon</i> )

433
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,792
Lieutenant!

434
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:36,333
This is impossible!

435
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,542
<i>Impossible!</i>

436
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,000
Pull yourself together.

437
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,083
Worf!

438
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,291
(<i> snarling</i> )

439
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,750
(<i> muttering</i> ):
At ease, Lieutenant, at ease.

440
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:58,458
Captain, the star
fix is fading.

441
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,542
Data, lock onto the<i> Yamato</i>
with a tractor beam.

442
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,333
We'll leave together.

443
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,667
I cannot make
the lock, sir.

444
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,375
Captain, the star fix
is almost gone.

445
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,709
Let it go.

446
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:10,709
But, sir, we can get<i> out.</i>

447
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:12,166
Let it go.

448
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,709
TRANSPORTER CHIEF:
Bridge.

449
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:16,000
I have reestablished contact
with the away team.

450
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Beam them back immediately.

451
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,083
Captain.

452
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:25,125
Come in, come in,
<i>Enterprise.</i>

453
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,458
TRANSPORTER CHIEF:
Hold position, away team.

454
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,917
I've got you.
We're bringing you home.

455
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,083
Transporter Room, hurry!

456
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,542
Captain, it's almost gone.

457
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:48,083
What the hell
is going on?

458
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,583
Are you all right,
Number One?
I've had it.

459
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,125
Let's put all this
technology to work

460
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,250
figure out
what is going on

461
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,792
and get the hell
out of here!

462
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,208
A ship that was almost
the<i> Yamato</i>

463
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:09,333
existing in a hole in space
with no crew aboard.

464
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,500
Now what is the purpose?

465
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,792
Add to that

466
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,750
an attack by a nonexistent
Romulan vessel.

467
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,083
It does suggest
an interesting question:

468
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,291
was our away team

469
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,458
actually over there?

470
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,125
If we weren't over there,
where the hell were we?

471
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:24,667
HASKELL:
Commander, I have reestablished
the star fix.

472
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,041
Great.

473
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,000
Set course.

474
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,291
Velocity,
warp two.

475
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,000
Course
and speed set.

476
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,166
Engage.

477
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,667
I've lost
contact, sir.

478
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,083
What?

479
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,375
The star fix is gone.

480
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,000
Captain, it is not
in the same sector

481
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,333
but another opening
has appeared.

482
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,166
All right, set a course
for those stars.

483
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:47,583
Warp 6.

484
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:49,959
Yes, sir,
warp six.

485
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:52,000
I've lost the
signal, sir.

486
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,792
What's going on here?

487
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,125
All stop.

488
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:59,208
Captain...

489
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,375
Yes, Mr. Data,
I can see it.

490
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,458
This game is now

491
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:05,375
wearing very thin.

492
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:09,333
Let's just hold
this position.

493
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:12,041
Counselor, you've
said that you sensed

494
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:13,667
no intelligence
in all of this.

495
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:16,166
You haven't changed
in that belief?

496
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:18,792
I am not certain
of that now, Captain.

497
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,834
I do sense
something unusual.

498
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:22,667
Perhaps a different

499
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:25,458
level of
consciousness?

500
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,875
Yes.

501
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:31,792
Perhaps an intelligence so vast
it eluded me.

502
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:33,291
Rats in a maze.

503
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,417
Exactly.

504
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,542
Hmm? Explain.

505
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:37,875
Well, everything
we've been through

506
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:40,041
reminds me
of a laboratory experiment.

507
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,792
As if something

508
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:43,250
was testing
our responses

509
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,917
to stimuli.

510
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:47,750
Are you suggesting...?

511
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,041
Are you suggesting

512
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,125
that we're in some
kind of laboratory?

513
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,000
Yes.

514
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:05,875
HASKELL:
The opening seems
closer, Captain.

515
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,959
I've had enough of being
led about in this way.

516
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,959
Agreed, Captain.
Hold present position.

517
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:14,834
Good. Don't satisfy
its curiosity.

518
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,291
WORF:
Captain, look!

519
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:25,166
Why are you so alarmed when
I've gone to such trouble

520
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:27,250
to look just like you?

521
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,625
Captain, sensors show nothing
out there.

522
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,542
Absolutely nothing.

523
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:35,750
Sure is a damned
ugly "nothing."

524
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,667
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS<i> Enterprise</i>

525
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,959
representing
a federation of planets

526
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:44,041
in this part of the galaxy.

527
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:48,458
Can you identify whoever
or whatever you are?

528
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,834
Nagilum!

529
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,458
Speaks right up for
something your sensors say

530
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,792
isn't there, Data.

531
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:57,458
We still have no idea
what you represent.

532
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,125
Data.

533
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,834
Nagilum.

534
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:04,667
You are of different
construction than the others.

535
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,041
Interesting.

536
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,500
Picard...

537
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:13,792
Riker...

538
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:17,291
Geordi...

539
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,500
Haskell...

540
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,375
What are<i> you?</i>

541
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,542
Your construction

542
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,041
also differs.

543
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,959
Oh...

544
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,709
My... construction?

545
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:37,083
Perhaps referring to
your gender, Doctor.

546
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:40,000
Yes, well, uh,
there are minor differences.

547
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,834
I'm what we call a female.

548
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:44,375
I understand.

549
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,750
The masculine
and the feminine.

550
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,792
It is the way in which
we propagate our species.

551
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:53,458
Please demonstrate
how this is accomplished.

552
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:55,875
Not likely.

553
00:32:55,875 --> 00:33:00,041
Whatever you are,
your actions are not welcome.

554
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,917
Let me put up
the shield, sir.

555
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:04,875
Sensors still show
nothing there.

556
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:08,417
Your life-form
surprises me more and more.

557
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:13,291
Is it true you also have only
a limited existence?

558
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,583
Answer.

559
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:15,875
What information
do you want?

560
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,709
I don't understand
the question.

561
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:22,583
You exist, and then
you cease to exist.

562
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,750
Your minds call it "death."

563
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:34,000
(<i> screaming</i> )

564
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,542
How interesting.

00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,792
(<i> beeping</i> )

566
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:00,750
(<i> electronic whine</i> )

567
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,583
He's gone.

568
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:11,667
We cannot allow you
to do that!

569
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:14,125
We will fight you.

570
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,750
To understand death

571
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,792
I must amass information
on every aspect of it.

572
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,291
Every kind of dying.

573
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,667
The experiment shouldn't
take more

574
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,750
than a third of your crew--

575
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,625
maybe half.

576
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:43,667
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42194.7.</i>

577
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,041
<i>It is obvious</i>
<i>that whatever we have met</i>

578
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:49,542
<i>sees no value in our kind</i>
<i>of life-form.</i>

579
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:52,500
<i>How do we fight something</i>
<i>that both is</i>

580
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,083
<i>and is not there?</i>

581
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:57,792
I know this much.

582
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:59,959
We are unimportant to it.

583
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:02,166
WORF:
In a battle
for survival, Captain

584
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,083
30 to 50% casualties...

585
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:05,542
Would be appalling.

586
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:07,667
But within
acceptable limits.

587
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,458
This is not a battle, Worf.

588
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:13,583
No, a laboratory
experiment would be
the closest comparison.

589
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:17,041
Is there any reason
for not believing this Nagilum?

590
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,041
No.

591
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,458
All evidence indicates

592
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:22,250
it is willing and able
to do as it proposes.

593
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,917
Agreed.

594
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:27,750
Under the circumstances, I think
there is only one decision.

595
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,083
I will not
stand by

596
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,834
while half my crew
is slaughtered.

597
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,458
Sir, I do not believe

598
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:35,166
there is anything you can do
to prevent it.

599
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,750
Yes, there is.

600
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,542
What?

601
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,291
Destroy the<i> Enterprise.</i>

602
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,500
Isn't that a little
like curing the disease

603
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,333
by killing the patient?

604
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,250
It's better than standing
around helplessly.

605
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

606
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,333
Why do I get the feeling

607
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,750
that this was not the time
to join this ship?

608
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:15,834
COMPUTER:
Recognize Picard, Jean-Luc.

609
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:19,417
Recognize Riker, William T.

610
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:22,000
Initiate auto-destruct sequence.

611
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,166
Does Riker, William T., concur?

612
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:25,500
I do.

613
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,583
Initiate auto-destruct sequence.

614
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,291
Desired time interval.

615
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,667
Stand by.

616
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,417
Interesting question.

617
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:39,041
How long to prepare to die?

618
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:42,834
What would be least painful
for our crew?

619
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:43,917
Move to it quickly

620
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:45,083
or allow them time

621
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:48,583
to prepare for it
thoroughly?

622
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:52,625
Well, 20 minutes--
nice round figure?

623
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:01,166
Initiate auto-destruct.

624
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:03,166
Interval...

625
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:05,375
20 minutes.

626
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,250
20 minutes to auto-destruct.

627
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:12,166
(<i> rhythmic buzzing</i> )

628
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:14,125
19 Minutes, 50 seconds.

631
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:35,458
Come.

632
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:43,125
Our destroying ourselves
won't change its mind, Captain.

633
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:45,583
I would feel that.

634
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,750
You didn't mention
you were that certain.

635
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,125
I was wrong
not to tell you.

636
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:52,709
And your decision
may also be wrong.

637
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

638
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,959
Yes, come in, please.

639
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,458
I have a question, sir.

640
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,583
Yes, Data, what is it?

641
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:12,625
What is death?

642
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,667
Oh, is that all?

643
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:22,834
Well, Data, you're asking

644
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,166
probably the most difficult
of all questions.

645
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:35,458
Some see it as a changing
into an indestructible form.

646
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:37,000
Forever unchanging.

647
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,709
They believe that the purpose
of the entire universe

648
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:43,458
is to then
maintain that form

649
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:46,250
in an Earth-like garden,
which will give delight

650
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,542
and pleasure
through all eternity.

651
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:50,792
On the other hand,
there are those

652
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:52,542
who hold to the idea

653
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:55,041
of our blinking
into nothingness...

654
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,291
(<i> snap</i> )

655
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,875
with all
of our experiences

656
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:04,625
and hopes and dreams
merely a delusion.

657
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,583
Which do you believe, sir?

658
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:16,667
Considering the marvelous
complexity of the universe--

659
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:19,291
its clockwork perfection

660
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:22,125
its balances
of this against that

661
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,000
matter, energy

662
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,208
gravitation,
time, dimension--

663
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:31,625
I believe that our existence
must be more

664
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:34,083
than either
of these philosophies.

665
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,792
That what we are

666
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:40,667
goes beyond Euclidean or other
practical measuring systems

667
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,625
and that our existence

668
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:44,250
is part of a reality

669
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,667
beyond what we understand
now as reality.

670
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:56,417
We should not let ourselves die,
Jean-Luc.

671
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:03,875
I agree with her... Jean-Luc.

672
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,041
TROI:
If only half
of us live

673
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:09,166
then I would rather take my
chances on being one that does.

674
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:12,792
Yes, it is wrong of you
to force us.

675
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,333
It is wrong.

676
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:20,250
Yes, this is very wrong.

677
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,834
Neither of you should
be reacting in this way.

678
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,417
Computer...

679
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:29,667
locate Commander Data for me.

680
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:33,709
Commander Data is on the Bridge.

681
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,333
It's not going to work, Nagilum.

682
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,709
DATA:
Captain, we are clear.

683
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,500
We are out of the void.

00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,125
RIKER:
It's gone, Captain.

685
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,583
We can abort the auto-destruct.

686
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,959
Hold, Number One.

687
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,667
But, Captain...
Hold.

688
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,375
COMPUTER:
One minute to auto-destruct.

689
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,792
We are out
of the void, sir.

690
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:09,208
You may stop auto-destruct.

691
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:10,917
Mr. Crusher, warp six,
any heading.

692
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:12,792
Now.

693
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,250

Captain.

697
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:35,291
It could all be part
of the illusion.

698
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,417
Commander Data, report.

699
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:38,792
All navigational
systems

700
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:41,917
confirm we are
at warp six, on course, sir.

701
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:45,083
Counselor Troi?

702
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:46,375
Captain
it has gone.

703
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,917
I no longer feel its presence.

704
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:50,917
20 seconds to auto-destruct.

705
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,959
Ten seconds to auto-destruct.

706
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:04,291
Captain.

707
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,375
Abort auto-destruct sequence.

708
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,583
Riker, William T.,
do you concur?

709
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,083
Yes, absolutely.

710
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,208
I do indeed concur
wholeheartedly.

711
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:16,000
Auto-destruct canceled.

712
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:25,792
A simple "yes" would have
sufficed, Number One.

713
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:29,250
I didn't want there to be any
chance of misunderstanding.

714
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,041
Of course.

715
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,417
You have the Bridge.

716
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:44,250
He sure held that bluff
to the last second.

717
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,750
Didn't he, sir?

718
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,709
Was he bluffing?

719
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:58,709
Well, Nagilum, I hope
you got what you needed.

720
00:42:58,709 --> 00:42:59,875
You have provided me

721
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,750
with much more than I needed.

722
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,208
Why did you release us?

723
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:09,583
You could have seen
the way we faced death.

724
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,041
It wasn't necessary.

725
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:14,375
I have learned
all I needed to know.

726
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:17,417
Would you like me to share
some of my conclusions?

727
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:18,625
I'm not interested.

728
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:20,166
Oh, of course you are.

729
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:23,917
You are too inquisitive
not to want to know.

730
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:27,959
You seem to find
no tranquility in anything.

731
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:31,041
You struggle
against the inevitable.

732
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,959
You thrive on conflict.

733
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:35,125
You are selfish

734
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:38,041
yet you value loyalty.

735
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:42,458
You are rash, quick to judge,
slow to change.

736
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:45,667
It's amazing you've survived.

737
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,375
Be that as it may

738
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,792
as species,
we have no common ground.

739
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:52,500
You are too aggressive...

740
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,917
too hostile, too militant.

741
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:59,041
During this period,
you, too, have been evaluated.

742
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,750
It would seem that we have
at least one thing in common.

743
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,834
Oh?

744
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:04,667
Curiosity.

745
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:07,583
The point
is well taken, Captain.

746
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:11,041
Perhaps that is a trait
we share.

747
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,333
Then perhaps
we shall meet again

748
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:17,250
but, next time, it will be
out here among the stars.

749
00:44:26,709 --> 00:44:28,792
Ensign, put us back on course.

750
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:29,875
Warp three.

751
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,291
Aye, sir, warp three.

752
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:34,458
And, Ensign, if you
encounter any holes...

753
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:35,875
steer clear.
