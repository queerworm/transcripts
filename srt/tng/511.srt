00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,625
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45397.3.</i>

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:08,834
<i>Two days ago</i>
<i>Starbase 514 lost contact</i>

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,041
<i>with the research</i>
<i>vessel</i> Vico

4
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,333
<i>which was sent to explore</i>

5
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,625
<i>the interior</i>
<i>of a black cluster.</i>

6
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,917
<i>We are en route</i>
<i>to investigate.</i>

7
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,208
Captain,
we're entering Sector 9-7.

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,125
I'm picking up massive
gravitational fluctuations, sir.

9
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,625
Take us out of warp,
Ensign.

10
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,166
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,500
The black cluster is within
visual range, Captain.

12
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:29,750
On screen.

13
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:32,000
Aye, sir.

14
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,375
RIKER:
Let's find that ship.

15
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:36,792
Full sensor sweep,
Mr. Data.

16
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:38,542
Aye, sir.

17
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,125
Quite a sight.

18
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:43,333
One of the most ancient
formations in the galaxy.

19
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,917
DATA:
I have located the<i> Vico,</i> sir.

20
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:47,000
The vessel appears
to be adrift.

21
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,625
Let's see it.

22
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,375
Life signs?

23
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:04,750
WORF:
Nothing, Commander.

24
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:06,709
Damage report,
Mr. Data.

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,834
Outer and inner hulls
have been breached.

26
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,583
Decks seven through 12
are exposed to space.

27
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,667
Set up a translink
to their computer core.

28
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:14,959
Let's see
what happened.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,500
I cannot, sir.

30
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,792
The emergency bulkheads
on that deck are in place.

31
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:20,875
Our link-up signal
cannot penetrate them.

32
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:23,083
Structural status,
Commander?

33
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,166
Stress readings indicate
considerable pressure

34
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,834
on the transverse
supports.

35
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,667
Is it stable enough
for an away team?

36
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:31,041
Yes sir, but the risk
of structural collapse

37
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,375
is quite high.

38
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:34,375
Have Transporter Room One
maintain a lock

39
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:36,041
on each member
of your away team.

40
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,750
I want you out of there
at the first sign of trouble.

41
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,959
Take us to
15,000 meters, Ensign.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,834
Yes sir.
Data, you're with me.

43
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,667
This station is
inoperable, sir.

44
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,083
This one seems to be
stuck in a feedback loop.

45
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's see if we can tap directly
into the computer core.

46
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,458
The O.D.N. Injunction
is right down here.

47
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,500
Data?

48
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,750
Core transfer
is engaged.

49
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,000
Exchange protocol
verified.

50
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,417
The files are intact--
at least some of them anyway.

51
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,583
(weak male voice)

52
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,875
Stay here, Geordi.

53
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,750
Data?

54
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,000
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

55
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:08,208
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise .

56
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,000
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

57
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,834
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

58
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:18,166
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

59
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:22,333
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

60
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,583
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

61
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,417
<i>A young boy, shielded</i>
<i>from our initial sensor scans,</i>

62
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,125
<i>has been discovered hidden</i>
<i>beneath a fallen beam.</i>

63
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,875
<i>The degree of damage</i>
<i>to the</i> Vico

64
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:31,917
<i>is making our rescue attempt</i>
<i>difficult.</i>

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,250
Transporter Room One,
can you lock onto him

66
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,333
and transport directly
to Sick Bay?

67
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,291
I'll try, Captain

68
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,750
but there's a lot of shielding
to pull him through.

69
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,333
Acknowledged.

70
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,333
Picard to Crusher.

71
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,834
Sick Bay here,
Captain.

72
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,083
PICARD:
Prepare for emergency transport.

73
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,834
Yes, sir.
Crusher out.

74
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,083
Picard to Commander Riker.

75
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,166
Is the boy ready,
Number One?

76
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,375
Ready, sir.

77
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,583
At your signal.

78
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,208
Aye, captain.

79
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,041
It's going
to be okay.

80
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,792
Here we go.

81
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,625
Energize.

82
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,875
PICARD:
Ensign, do we have him?

83
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,625
The lock is holding.

84
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:21,250
I just can't resolve
the matter stream--

85
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,000
not with all that
victurium alloy in the way.

86
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,417
Commander Riker, you'll have to
get him out into the corridor.

87
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,959
DATA:
I could move the beam, sir.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,458
However, it may
initiate the collapse

89
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,208
of the surrounding
supports.

90
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,500
I recommend you and Geordi
return to the ship.

91
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,917
Agreed.
La Forge.

92
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,875
I'm locked onto
commander Data

93
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,709
and the boy, sir,
I'll energize as soon as

94
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,834
they've cleared
the bulkheads.

95
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:02,917
Whenever you're ready,
Data.

96
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,417
DATA:
Yes, sir.

97
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,291
You're going
to lift that?

98
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,333
Yes.

99
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,041
Then I will take you
to the corridor.

100
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,291
We will transport back
to the<i> Enterprise</i> from there.

101
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,333
Do you understand?

102
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,375
How come you can pick up
something so heavy?

103
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,750
I am an android.

104
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:21,417
My strength is many times
that of a human.

105
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,709
It is going to be...
okay.

106
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,166
I will count to three.

107
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,375
One... two...

108
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,917
three.

109
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,834
Energize.

110
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,250
Don't be afraid.

111
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,458
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

112
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,041
<i>A thorough</i>
<i>search of the Vico</i>

113
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,417
<i>has revealed no</i>
<i>additional survivors.</i>

114
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,417
<i>We have begun the process</i>
<i>of counseling the boy</i>

115
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,458
<i>with regard</i>
<i>to the tragedy.</i>

116
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,500
We were in
the black cluster.

117
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,166
I don't know
where they came from.

118
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,875
They had a big ship.

119
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,041
Then they kept
shooting at us.

120
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,500
Then they beamed over.

121
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:42,667
They had purple helmets on

122
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,542
and phaser rifles.

123
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:49,417
I saw them.
They didn't see me.

124
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,083
You're safe now,
Timothy.

125
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,875
I'm sorry for
what happened.

126
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,667
It's going to be
all right.

127
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,000
I bet you're hungry.

128
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,959
Would you like me to get
you something to eat?

129
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,417
Counselor,
I must join

130
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,041
Commander La Forge
in Engineering.

131
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,792
If you will excuse me.

132
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,917
Timothy,
would you like Data

133
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,625
to stay with you
a little bit longer?

134
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,291
Sections of the primary
and secondary hull

135
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,875
were torn right off.

136
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:38,125
The shearing planes
are here, here...

137
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,709
and here.

138
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:45,625
How much longer until
we can access their logs?

139
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,333
Almost an hour.

140
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,542
PICARD:
The boy was here.

141
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,709
Mm-hmm. The hallway
outside the computer core.

142
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,583
His mother was the ship's
systems engineer.

143
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,333
The second away team
found her body here

144
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,000
inside the core.

145
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,291
And his father?

146
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,875
Ship's second officer.

147
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,250
He was most likely
on the bridge

148
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,250
when it was
exposed to space.

149
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,166
Most likely.

150
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:33,417
He'll sleep for
a few hours, at least.

151
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,291
I don't need
to keep him here,

152
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,709
but I will need to
see him again tomorrow.

153
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:42,208
You've got your work
cut out for you.

154
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,166
His world is gone, Data.

155
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,166
We're going to have to help him
build a new one.

156
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,375
This is not good.

157
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:07,083
Whatever hit the<i> Vico</i> must
have set up an e.m. pulse

158
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,917
that flashed through
their computer banks.

159
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,208
Nearly 83% of their
records have been lost.

160
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,083
And all of their
sensor logs.

161
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,875
Let's use what we got
from our own sensors.

162
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,333
I'll call up
the structural analysis

163
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,917
and the surface scans.

164
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,792
Geordi...

165
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,458
as a child,

166
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,959
did you ever experience
a traumatic event?

167
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,083
You're wondering
about Timothy?

168
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,542
Yes.

169
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,583
I was caught
in a fire once.

170
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:00,208
I must have been...

171
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,750
I don't know--
about five, I guess.

172
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,959
It was before I got
the first visor,

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,959
and it was only
a couple of minutes

174
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,458
before my parents found me
and pulled me out.

175
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
And nobody got hurt,

176
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,208
but I tell you...

177
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,917
that was the longest
couple of minutes of my life.

178
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,625
It was a while
after that before

179
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:33,625
I could even let my parents
get out of earshot.

180
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,500
It was like...

181
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:39,333
I absolutely
needed to know

182
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,625
that they were there,
you know?

183
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,250
Timothy no longer has
that kind of support.

184
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,125
Yeah.

185
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,500
MAN:
"Dara and her brother

186
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,709
"found themselves
in the land of Tagas

187
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,208
"where the ruler,
Elamos the magnificent,

188
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,667
"had proclaimed as law:

189
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,709
"'no children
will be tolerated

190
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,291
within the great
kingdom.'

191
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,875
"When Dara saw
the proclamation,

192
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:07,750
"she just
laughed and said,

193
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,291
"'How magnificent
a ruler,

194
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,709
to be frightened
by the likes of us.'"

195
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,959
Timothy, we're done
with sculpture for now.

196
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,625
It's not finished.

197
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,041
We'll come back to it
next period.

198
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,458
Why don't you pick up
your mythology book

199
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,041
and follow along?

200
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,542
But it's not finished.

201
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,959
Magnetic residual
analysis confirms

202
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,792
that the<i> Vico</i> was
definitely attacked

203
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,125
inside the black cluster.

204
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,375
The graviton wave fronts

205
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,917
pushed the ship
to where we found it.

206
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,959
No signs of phaser burns
on the hull.

207
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,125
No, sir.

208
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,917
The torsional
stress levels point

209
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:52,208
to a disrupter-
style weapon.

210
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,583
Fracture points indicate
that the energy burst

211
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,250
came from a range of
less than 3,000 meters.

212
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:00,792
But that's a strategy

213
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,667
consistent with
a cloaked vessel--

214
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:06,625
Romulan or Klingon--

215
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:07,834
but we're quite
a distance

216
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,709
from either of
their territories.

217
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,750
The Breen have outposts
in this sector.

218
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:13,834
The attack on the<i> Vico</i>
is consistent with

219
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,458
their battle tactics
and their level of technology.

220
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,291
Thank you, Data.

221
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,542
But...

222
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,959
what would
the Breen be doing

223
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,333
inside the black cluster?

224
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,375
The boy described
a boarding party

225
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,542
with helmets
and phaser rifles.

226
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,291
A boarding party?

227
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,750
I don't think
that's likely, sir.

228
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,417
Counselor.

229
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:39,917
There was absolutely
no evidence

230
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,750
of anybody coming
on board the<i> Vico.</i>

231
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,792
We would have found
a transporter field trace.

232
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:45,542
Or if somebody had
used the entry ports,

233
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,250
we would have found
an electrostatic differential

234
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,333
in the docking latches,
and we didn't.

235
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,709
Could Timothy have
imagined that, Counselor?

236
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,208
Or could he be lying?

237
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,166
If he's lying, I haven't
been able to sense it.

238
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,917
Perhaps his emotional
trauma level is too high.

239
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,083
Why wouldn't
he tell us the truth?

240
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,417
He's still in shock.
It's hard to know

241
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,458
what's going on
in his mind right now.

242
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,792
Well, I'll go back and check
the sensor readings again,

243
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,500
but I don't think
we're gonna find anything.

244
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:13,458
Thank you, Geordi.

245
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,000
TROI:
Data?

246
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,333
Captain, I think
we should ask Data

247
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,041
to spend some time
with him.

248
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,208
I do not understand.

249
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,041
I'm very worried
about his behavior,

250
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,792
and what I just heard doesn't
make me feel any better.

251
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:30,375
Data, you're the only one
he's reached out to,

252
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:32,375
because
you rescued him.

253
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:35,250
We can use your relationship
with him to help his recovery.

254
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,667
Would Timothy be
more inclined

255
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:39,083
to tell Data the truth
about what happened?

256
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,125
It's a possibility.

257
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,959
Commander,
proceed with Timothy

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,500
as the counselor
suggests.

259
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,875
Aye, sir.

260
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:53,041
Counselor, exactly
how shall I proceed?

261
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,417
Just be with him.

262
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,125
You're a presence
he trusts,

263
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,750
and that's what
he needs most right now.

264
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,542
(<i> door chime</i> )

265
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,291
What?

266
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,083
Data.

267
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,083
Hello, Timothy.
May I enter?

268
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,667
Yeah.

269
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,166
Ahh.

270
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,417
You are attempting
to re-create...

271
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,875
the Dokkaran Temple
of Kural-Hanesh.

272
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,667
Isn't it great?

273
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:39,959
See, there's the big hallway
the teacher told us about.

274
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,375
And that's where
everybody came in.

275
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:43,792
That's where
they stood,

276
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:45,875
and that's where
the altar was.

277
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,667
What do you think?

278
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,500
Do you wish
a frank evaluation?

279
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,917
It lacks the harmony
that characterized

280
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,375
this particular temple

281
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:01,208
and the Dokkaran
culture in general.

282
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,583
You hate it.

283
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:10,000
No, I am not
capable of hatred.

284
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,792
I can't do
anything right.

285
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,583
You are making an
unwarranted extrapolation.

286
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,333
I was merely offering
an aesthetic analysis

287
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,333
of this
particular model.

288
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,125
The base appears
quite sturdy.

289
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,667
I told you.

290
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,834
May I suggest
a different approach?

291
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,417
You are attempting
to construct

292
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,125
the upper level before
the supports are in place.

293
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,083
Observe.

294
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,291
LA FORGE:
La Forge to Data.

295
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,625
Data here.

296
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,083
I need your help with
the shield modulators.

297
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,875
I will join you in a moment,
Geordi. Data out.

298
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:05,542
Lieutenant La Forge
requires my assistance.

299
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,250
Incredible.

300
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,041
Data?

301
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,875
How come you can
do that?

302
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:43,166
I am designed
to exceed human capacity,

303
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,709
both mentally
and physically.

304
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,917
Androids are
better than humans?

305
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,458
"Better" is a highly
subjective term.

306
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,750
I do not, for example,
possess the ability

307
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,125
to experience emotion,
as humans do.

308
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,709
No emotions?

309
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,667
You mean you can't
be happy or sad?

310
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,625
That is correct.

311
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,291
Why not?

312
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,041
My positronic brain
is not capable

313
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,917
of generating
those conditions.

314
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,333
Good-bye.

315
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,417
Data?

316
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:24,333
Can we build
something else later?

317
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,333
That would be
acceptable.

318
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,834
Bye.

319
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,125
(<i> like Data:</i> )
I am designed to exceed
human capacity.

320
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,709
That is correct.

321
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,291
The black cluster
was formed

322
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,792
almost nine billion years ago

323
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:20,291
when hundreds of
proto-stars

324
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,500
collapsed
in close proximity.

325
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,458
The resulting
gravitational forces

326
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,834
are both violent
and highly unpredictable.

327
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,583
To get anywhere
near the center,

328
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,917
we're going to have to push
through the graviton wave fronts

329
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,333
like the science ship
was designed to do.

330
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,333
I've already adjusted
our shields accordingly.

331
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,583
The gravitational forces
will affect sensor accuracy.

332
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,208
Detecting an enemy vessel
will be difficult.

333
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,834
Maybe that's what
happened to the<i> Vico.</i>

334
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,166
They didn't see anything coming
until it was too late.

335
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,875
Counselor,

336
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:48,875
has the boy volunteered
any further information?

337
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,709
No, but I do have
an appointment with him

338
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,208
in less than
half an hour.

339
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,959
If there's a possibility
of getting more from him,

340
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,458
I'd like you
to pursue it.

341
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,083
But we need to continue
our investigation.

342
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,834
We'll enter the black cluster
at 0700 hours tomorrow morning.

343
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,250
Dismissed.

344
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:13,625
Hello, Timothy.

345
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,041
Are you ready to go?

346
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes, Counselor,
I am ready.

347
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,792
How are you feeling?

348
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,000
I am functioning within
established parameters.

349
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,125
Established parameters?

350
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,625
You sound like Data.

351
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,834
I am an android.

352
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,542
I see.

353
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,792
Well, let's go
for our walk, shall we?

354
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,875
That would be
acceptable.

355
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:48,166
TROI:
So, what would you like?

356
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,083
Androids do not need
to eat or drink.

357
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:06,208
However, we sometimes
like to taste things.

358
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,000
A tamarin frost,
please.

359
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,625
Would you like
anything, Counselor?

360
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,959
No, I'm fine,
thank you.

361
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,417
As you wish.

362
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:17,125
So... you're
no longer human.

363
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:20,667
I'm an android.

364
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:22,125
When did this happen?

365
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:25,291
I've always been
an android.

366
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:28,375
What's it like,
being an android?

367
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:31,083
I'm designed to exceed
human capacity,

368
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,959
both mentally
and physically,

369
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,583
but I do not
experience emotions.

370
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,667
You don't?

371
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:38,625
No emotion at all?

372
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,625
That is correct.

373
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:42,875
An android?

374
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:44,625
TROI:
I know it sounds unusual,

375
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,583
but it is
understandable.

376
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,333
Technically,
it's called enantiodromia.

377
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,500
Conversion into
the opposite.

378
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:54,667
Timothy went from
human to machine--

379
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:57,500
from being emotional
to being emotionless,

380
00:23:57,542 --> 00:24:00,417
but the underlying
trauma is still there.

381
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:03,000
He's just found
a new way to suppress it.

382
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:07,125
Counselor...

383
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:11,250
how long will
this behavior last?

384
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,417
As long as
he needs it to.

385
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:17,291
Timothy is rebuilding
his identity as best he can.

386
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,750
The android persona is

387
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,208
just one step
along the way.

388
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,417
As soon as he feels stronger
and more sure of himself,

389
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,250
it should drop away
naturally.

390
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,542
I assume this is
not the time to confront him

391
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,000
about what happened
to his ship.

392
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,834
Not yet-- the best thing
we can do right now is

393
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,500
let Timothy take us
where he wants to go.

394
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:37,834
We should support the process
and even encourage it.

395
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,500
Data, I would like you
to make Timothy the best android

396
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:44,375
he can possibly be.

397
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:05,667
Timothy, your head movements
are counterproductive.

398
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:07,125
Can you be still?

399
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,834
But you do it.

400
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,750
The servo-mechanisms
in my neck are designed

401
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:14,625
to approximate
human movements.

402
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,959
I did not realize the effect
was so distracting.

403
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,875
I like it.

404
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:28,208
Data, are there any other
androids in Starfleet?

405
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,375
No, I am the only one.

406
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:33,625
How come
you're not captain?

407
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:37,542
My service record does not
yet warrant such a position.

408
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:41,166
Data?

409
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,208
What's the scariest thing
that ever happened to you?

410
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,834
Fear is not a quality
that I possess.

411
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,625
Because it's an emotion.

412
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,083
Correct.

413
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,291
But...

414
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,500
but what if you...

415
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:01,000
you had a nightmare?

416
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,792
I have never had
a nightmare.

417
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:05,291
I do not
require sleep.

418
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,250
Timothy...

419
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,625
are you having
disturbing dreams?

420
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,959
I do not
require sleep.

421
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:36,500
Is that satisfactory?

422
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,208
It's perfect.

423
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,750
Transfer circuits are
functioning properly.

424
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:47,375
Within established
parameters?

425
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:49,041
Absolutely.

426
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:52,208
Input processing,
pattern recognition,

427
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,083
all within
established parameters.

428
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:58,291
BOTH:
Thank you, Doctor.

429
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,917
I ran out of red ocher.

430
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,250
You may use mine.

431
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:35,500
Thank you.

432
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,875
Perhaps you should
return to your quarters.

433
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:51,875
I'm fine.

434
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,458
The servo-mechanisms
in my mouth

435
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,583
are designed to approximate
human movements.

436
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,667
That is not bad.

437
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,667
Thank you.

438
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,333
It is very...
expressive.

439
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:20,166
Thank you.

440
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:23,542
Is your painting
representative of something?

441
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:26,709
It's just a painting.

442
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,667
Timothy,
you understand

443
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:36,125
that you may speak to me
about anything you wish.

444
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,000
Any subject.

445
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,750
I understand.

446
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:44,000
At times...

447
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,542
I, too, find it
difficult

448
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:48,166
to share my thoughts
with others.

449
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:51,208
I am not always confident
that I am expressing myself

450
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,083
in a manner which
humans can comprehend.

451
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,834
But I do know that...

452
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:43,917
We are approaching
the perimeter.

453
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:46,500
I am picking up
the gravitational wave fronts.

454
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:49,291
Engage forward
shields 35%.

455
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,291
Shields up.

456
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,333
Drop to one-quarter
impulse, Ensign.

457
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,583
Yes, sir.

458
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,834
Bridge to Engineering.

459
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,250
Adjusting shield
frequencies now, Commander.

460
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:13,542
We'll have this smoothed out
in just a second.

461
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:24,208
Ensign, adjust course
for any deviations.

462
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,417
Yes, sir.

463
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,959
Resume
one-third impulse.

464
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,792
Captain, I am
reading something

465
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:31,250
at 400,000 kilometers
off the starboard bow--

466
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:32,583
possibly a ship.

467
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:35,083
Red alert.

468
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,542
Take us to visual range,
Ensign.

469
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,750
Adjusting course.

470
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:42,041
Sensor readings have
disappeared... wait.

471
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,083
I am picking up
another reading

472
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,917
at 400,000 kilometers
off the port bow.

473
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,208
It's gone... no...

474
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,417
It is back
to starboard.

475
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:54,834
Captain,
the black cluster's

476
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,500
distorting the sensors--
we're picking up

477
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:59,709
echoes of the<i> Enterprise</i> 
reflecting off the wave fronts.

478
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,291
Cancel red alert.

479
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,041
Mr. Worf,
adjust sensors

480
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,458
to compensate
for the distortion.

481
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,750
Aye.

482
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,750
Sensor difficulties
have been reported

483
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:10,667
by ships traveling
through black clusters,

484
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:12,125
but never this extreme.

485
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:14,834
Captain,that formation
is seven times more massive

486
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,208
than any explored
previously.

487
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,375
That could explain
the difference.

488
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,500
Resume previous
course, Ensign.

489
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:23,333
Yes, sir.

490
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:40,375
He laughed.

491
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,500
Yes.

492
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,750
It's nice to see,
isn't it?

493
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:45,083
It is certainly
not consistent

494
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,542
with his android persona.

495
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,291
I'd say he's
beginning the process

496
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,291
of letting go
of that fantasy.

497
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,083
Then my work
with him is done.

498
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,750
No, I... I don't
think it is, Data.

499
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:02,458
A laugh is one step
in the right direction.

500
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,375
We need to help him
take a few more steps.

501
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:07,291
How, Counselor?

502
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,083
I'd like you
to talk to him

503
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:12,417
about your own
fascination with humanity.

504
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,166
If you explain
to Timothy

505
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,500
the appeal that
humanity has for you,

506
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:20,250
he might find it easier
to become a boy again.

507
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,667
This is great.
How is yours?

508
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,542
The complex
polysaccharides,

509
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,000
in reaction with
the carbon dioxide,

510
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,291
produces an unusual
combination of texture

511
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,375
and effervescence.

512
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:49,166
But how does
it taste?

513
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:50,917
Is it good?

514
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:53,959
I am not capable of tasting
in the manner you suggest.

515
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,208
However,
I can analyze

516
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,792
the composition
of a dessert

517
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:59,250
and make comparative
conclusions

518
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,625
about its possible effect
on the human palate.

519
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,875
But I neither like it
nor dislike it.

520
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,083
Oh.

521
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,500
I didn't realize that.

522
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:10,750
I have often wondered
what it must be like

523
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:11,959
to have one's...

524
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,917
mouth water
in anticipation

525
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,583
of the arrival
of a confection...

526
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,709
or to feel the pleasure
I have observed in humans

527
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,083
as they consume it.

528
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,792
You sound like you don't
want to be an android.

529
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:26,041
I am an android.

530
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,542
That will never change.

531
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,667
But if you
could change...

532
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:34,875
would you?

533
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,500
I have often wished
to be human.

534
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:42,166
I study people
carefully

535
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,709
in order to more closely
approximate human behavior.

536
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,166
Why? We're stronger
and smarter than humans.

537
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,667
We can do more
than they can.

538
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:52,792
But I cannot take pride
in my abilities.

539
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:56,083
I cannot take pleasure
in my accomplishments.

540
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,750
But we never have
to feel bad either.

541
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:07,291
I would gladly risk
feeling bad at times

542
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:09,667
if it also meant
that I could...

543
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,917
taste my dessert.

544
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,709
Captain, gravitational
wave front intensity

545
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,959
is increasing steadily--

546
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,500
1100 standard "G" units
and rising.

547
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:36,750
Let's see
if anyone's out there.

548
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,166
Mr. Worf,

549
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,250
attempt a wide-range
sensor sweep.

550
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,166
Aye, sir.

551
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,709
Gravitational distortion
is too great, Captain.

552
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,542
The scanning signal
is again being

553
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,792
reflected off
the wave fronts.

554
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:53,125
I am unable
to compensate.

555
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:54,667
Sensors are useless.

556
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,333
Mr. Data to
the bridge, please.

557
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,542
DATA:
Acknowledged.

558
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,083
Adjust sensors
to short range.

559
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:01,542
Attempt a limited
positron scan.

560
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:05,208
The distortion is
still in effect.

561
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,041
Try to jacket
the scanning beam.

562
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:12,458
The secondary beam is
being distorted as well.

563
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,208
Mr. Data,

564
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,291
our sensors are being
rendered ineffective

565
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:18,458
by the field
distortion.

566
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,250
I want your analysis.

567
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,959
Mr. Worf...

568
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,917
fire phasers,
maximum intensity,

569
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:30,583
limited spectrum,
001-mark-045.

570
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,458
An experiment,
Captain?

571
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,125
Exactly,
Number One.

572
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,834
Firing phasers.

573
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,375
Explanation,
Mr. Data?

574
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:50,083
Phaser energy
was reflected

575
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,041
by the gravitational
wave fronts.

576
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,375
It is similar
to the phenomenon

577
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,291
distorting our
sensor signals.

578
00:35:56,417 --> 00:35:58,792
Phasers and sensors,
both useless.

579
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,542
Mr. Data, this
reflection phenomenon--

580
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:03,875
would it have
the same effect

581
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:05,834
on a disrupter-style
weapon?

582
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,959
Yes, sir, disrupters
would be ineffective.

583
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,709
And a ship's
cloaking field?

584
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,125
It would be extremely
difficult to maintain, sir.

585
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:15,875
Mr. Data,
is it at all likely

586
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:17,458
that the<i> Vico</i> could
have been attacked

587
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,375
inside the cluster?

588
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:21,291
Given the effects
we have observed,

589
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:23,875
the probability is
exceedingly remote, sir.

590
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,583
Picard to Counselor Troi.

591
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,542
TROI:
Yes, Captain?

592
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:33,500
Counselor, will you bring
Timothy to my ready room?

593
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,250
Timothy,
can you tell us

594
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,667
what happened
to your ship?

595
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:39,709
I did tell you!

596
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,709
Tell us again.

597
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,125
We were attacked.

598
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,083
That is highly unlikely.
Our investigations...

599
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,500
We were attacked!
We were attacked!

600
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,166
Timothy...

601
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,792
androids do not lie.

602
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,041
It was me.

603
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,625
Please explain.

604
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,250
It was me.

605
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:09,000
I did it.

606
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,917
I killed them all.

607
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,625
Everything was shaking.

608
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,083
I lost my balance.

609
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:34,458
I was just trying
to hold on to something.

610
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:40,542
I didn't mean
to do it.

611
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:43,458
What was it that you
didn't mean to do, Timothy?

612
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:47,000
My arm...

613
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,083
hit the computer panel.

614
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:52,792
That's what destroyed
the ship.

615
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:54,250
The ship was damaged

616
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:56,667
when your arm hit
the computer panel?

617
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:00,917
Timothy,
listen to me.

618
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:03,542
The damage to your ship
might have occurred

619
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:07,166
at the same time
your arm touched the panel,

620
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,750
but it was only
a coincidence.

621
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:12,709
This wasn't your fault.

622
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,000
Yes, it was.

623
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,834
It is not possible.

624
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,667
The onboard
control systems

625
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:21,250
for every starship require
a user code clearance.

626
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:23,208
You could not have
inadvertently affected

627
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,917
any of the<i> Vico's</i> systems.

628
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,291
Your computer had
safety precautions.

629
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,041
There is nothing
you could have touched

630
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,208
that would have
damaged your ship.

631
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,667
You're not responsible

632
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:34,792
for what happened
to your parents, Timothy.

633
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,625
But if it wasn't me...

634
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:40,834
We're trying to determine
what happened right now,

635
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:43,583
and if there is anything
you can remember that

636
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,166
might assist...

637
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,750
That's just how it was...

638
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:51,792
when it started
on the<i> Vico.</i>

639
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,792
Wave front intensity
has increased.

640
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:07,542
Increase shields
to 75%.

641
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:09,041
Aye, sir.

642
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,750
Damage, Mr. Worf?

643
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,750
Minimal, sir.
Shields are holding.

644
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:19,250
Ensign, full about.
Go to warp two.

645
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:24,125
The gravitational
distortion is too high.

646
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:26,083
We can't maintain
a warp field.

647
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,041
Full shields.

648
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:30,000
WORF:
Aye.

649
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,959
Captain, impulse power
has been disrupted.

650
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,750
The helm won't respond.

651
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,375
We couldn't get out
either.

652
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,125
Timothy, perhaps
you and I should go below

653
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,583
and get out
of everyone's way.

654
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:42,583
No.

655
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:43,583
RIKER:
Riker to La Forge.

656
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:44,750
Can you get me
more power

657
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:46,542
to the shields?
Stand by.

658
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,500
That's what
they kept saying.

659
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:51,041
"More shields.
More shields."

660
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,875
Timothy,
accompany me, please.

661
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,750
I want you to recall everything
you heard people say

662
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,667
aboard the<i> Vico</i>
before it was destroyed.

663
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:03,041
I don't know.
Just that.

664
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,291
Just "more shields."

665
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,333
LA FORGE:
Captain, I've transferred

666
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,083
fusion reactors
four through nine

667
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,458
into the shield array.

668
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,333
That should double
the shield strength.

669
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,083
Wave front intensity
has increased

670
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,834
by an order
of magnitude.

671
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,417
Impact in three...

672
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,291
two... one.

673
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:25,667
Wave front intensity is
continuing to increase.

674
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:28,417
Structural overpressure
now exceeding 180%.

675
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,166
La Forge!
I don't understand.

676
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,166
That should have
been enough.

677
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,458
We could run
the shield grid

678
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,917
directly off the warp drive.

679
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:35,208
Go ahead, Commander.

680
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,667

681
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:39,291

"Warp power

685
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:47,000
They said that too,
Data, I'm positive.

686
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,458
Wave front intensity
has increased

687
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,750

Without additional
power to the shields,

690
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,000
the outer hull
will not hold.

691

00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,291
Warp transfer
to the shields complete.

693
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:04,667
That's as strong as
they're going to get.

694
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,625
WORF:
Impact in 15 seconds.

695
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,625
Sir, drop the shields.

696
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,834
That's suicide,
Data.

697
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:14,458
Captain,
drop the shields.

698
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,208
Make it so.

699
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,583
Aye.

700
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,041
Our own shields
caused the increases

701
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,291
in the wave fronts, sir.

702
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,750
We have been
experiencing

703
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:41,667
a harmonic
amplification effect.

704
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:43,375
The more energy
we dumped into the shield,

705
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,750
the worse the impact.

706
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:46,083
Precisely.

707
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,750
That is also
what destroyed the<i> Vico.</i>

708
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:51,792
When Timothy remembered
similar procedures on his ship,

709
00:41:51,834 --> 00:41:54,417
I initiated an analysis
of shield output

710
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,125
to wave front
amplification

711
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:57,709
and discovered
a correlation.

712
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,375
If we had transferred
all that warp power

713
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,041
to the shields...

714
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:04,959
it would have torn
the ship apart.

00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,583

716
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,458

Timothy's a boy feeling
a great deal of pain,

727
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:45,041
but he is
a boy again.

728
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:52,291
Is this difficult
for you, Data?

729
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:54,792
Difficult?

730
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:57,792
To watch him moving away
from being like you.

731
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,417
That would require
an emotional context

732
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,542
which I cannot provide.

733
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,417
Okay, everybody,
let's go.

734
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,750
Hello, Timothy.

735
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,500
Hi, Data.

736
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:20,959
How are you?

737
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:25,500
I am operating within
established parameters.

738
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:26,917
How are you?

739
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,458
I miss my parents.

740
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:32,959
But...

741
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,959
I'm okay.

742
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:39,709
I guess you thought
I was pretty silly

743
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,000
when I had my hair
like yours and everything.

744
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:45,375
I have been told
that imitation is

745
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:47,291
the highest form
of flattery.

746
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:53,709
Can we still
do things together,

747
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,834
even if I'm not
really an android?

748
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:58,041
I have many
human friends.

749
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,166
I would be pleased
to count you among them.

750
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:03,625
That would be...

751
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,542
acceptable.
