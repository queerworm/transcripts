1
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:06,458
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46578.4:</i>

2
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:09,583
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has arrived</i>
<i>at station Deep Space Nine</i>

3
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,458
<i>to assist</i>
<i>in the reconstruction</i>

4
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,667
<i>of the Bajoran</i>
<i>aqueduct systems</i>

5
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,583
<i>damaged during</i>
<i>the Cardassian occupation.</i>

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,875
I should be through with
the water contaminant

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,500
analysis in a few hours.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,542
Then I'm going to check out
one of the Holosuites.

9
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:27,583
They have a relaxation
program here, Jean-Luc,

10
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,083
from Alture VII.

11
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,458
Listen to this.

12
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,583
First, they bathe you
in a protein bath.

13
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,125
Then a cloud of
chromal vapor

14
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,542
carries you into
a meditation chamber.

15
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:39,083
You should try it.

16
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,625
Well, I'll be too busy

17
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,166
discussing the finer points
of water management

18
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,500
with ten Bajoran
bureaucrats.

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,458
And they won't be carrying me
on a cloud of chromal vapor.

20
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,375
Ops.

21
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,250
What<i> is</i> this?

22
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,667
It's pasta al fiorella.
It's one of my favorites.

23
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:02,834
Don't worry.
You're going to love it.

24
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:05,375
You know, I really want to take
a look at those Ktaran antiques.

25
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,750
I understand they've got
a 21st-century plasma coil

26
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,667
that's in almost
perfect condition.

27
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

28
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:18,709
I'll have to talk to Chief
O'Brien about these replicators.

29
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,333
Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,375
Worf, I don't see how
you can eat that stuff.

31
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,166
It tastes like
liquid polymer.

32
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,333
Delicious.

33
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:34,000
You know, I think I'm going to
try that kiosk on the other side
of the promenade.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,166
It looked like they had
some real food.
Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,542
DATA: Commander, I am
reading a minor power drain

36
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,750
in the starboard
EPS conduit.

37
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,667
What's causing it?

38
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,750
The problem is
originating in Sick Bay.

39
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,750
There has been
an unauthorized access

40
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,125
into the computer's
bio-imaging systems.

41
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,208
Better check it out.
Aye, sir.

42
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,834
Excuse me.

43
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:20,125
Do you have authorization
to work in this area?

44
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,458
Come in, come in.

45
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:25,375
I need a hand with
this field generator.

46
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,834
See if you can boost
the power output to 65%.

47
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,542
I am sorry, but use
of Sick Bay equipment

48
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:35,959
is limited to
ship's medical personnel.

49
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,083
Ah! Dr. Julian Bashir,

50
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,458
Chief Medical Officer,
Deep Space Nine.

51
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,750
And you are...

52
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,166
Commander...?
Data.

53
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,959
Commander Data.

54
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,250
The synthetic life-form?
Yes.

55
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,542
It's an honor
to meet you, sir.

56
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,250
I've heard
so much about you.

57
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,291
Ah, you must have
a fascinating perspective

58
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,083
into bio-cybernetic
research.

59
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,417
I'd be delighted if we could
discuss the subject sometime.

60
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,041
I would be happy
to do so.

61
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,500
However, I must ask you
to stop your experiment.
Ah, yes.

62
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,250
I realize I should have asked
before using your Sick Bay,

63
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,959
but it would have taken me
days to analyze this device

64
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,625
with the computer I have
on Deep Space Nine.

65
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,542
What type of device
is this?

66
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,542
It was discovered
in the Gamma Quadrant.

67
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:16,375
I think it must be some
sort of medical instrument.

68
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,709
It appears to employ
plasma inputs.

69
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,750
Well, I'm hoping
it's a medical scanner.

70
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,458
I wanted to use your computer
to find out how it works.

71
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,041
I suggest we take it
to Engineering

72
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,041
and run a complete
circuit-pathway diagnostic.

73
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,083
Splendid.

74
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,458
I must admit,
Commander,

75
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,834
I didn't think you'd be so...
personable.

76
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,959
Klingon.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,250
You are<i> Starfleet</i> Klingon.

78
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,208
I am Lieutenant Worf.

79
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,917
Worf...

80
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:06,000
son of Mogh?

81
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,375
What of it?

82
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,458
I am Jaglom Shrek,

83
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,750
a man with
information to sell.

84
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,625
You have no information
I could use.

85
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,667
I would not be so sure.

86
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:33,208
It is about
your father, Mogh.

87
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:38,083
My father died 25 years ago
at Khitomer.

88
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,917
That is what you believe.

89
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:43,750
What if I tell you

90
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,333
he is still alive?

91
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:20,166
PICARD:
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

92
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:24,208
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

93
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,083
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

94
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:30,041
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

95
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:34,500
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

96
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,250
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

97
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:41,542
My father is dead.
No, he's not.

98
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:44,417
I know where he is.

99
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,083
How is that possible?

100
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,500
I expect to be paid
for my information.

101
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,917
Perhaps we could
negotiate an exchange.

102
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,458
The location of
your father for...

103
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:57,291
Tell me what you know.

104
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,750
Not all the Klingons
at Khitomer

105
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,625
were killed
during the massacre.

106
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,500
Many were captured
by the Romulans

107
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,041
and placed in a prison camp
on a remote planet.

108
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,291
Your father was among them.

109
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,542
Where is this planet?

110
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,709
Not far from here.

111
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,792
I could give you
the location...

112
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:19,458
for a price.

113
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:23,583
A Klingon would rather die
than be taken prisoner.

114
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:27,959
I should kill you for
spreading lies about my family.

115
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,834
My father was killed
defending Khitomer.

116
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,667
Ensign Lopez, this duty roster
is unacceptable.

117
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,041
Assignments should be listed
in order of priority.

118
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,542
Prepare it again.

119
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:05,750
I will expect it
no later than 0900 hours.

120
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,083
Dismissed.

121
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:12,500
Mr. Worf, we'll need to get
your rendezvous schedule

122
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,583
to Commander Rudman
aboard the<i> Merrimack...</i>

123
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,875
I am well aware of
your request, Commander.

124
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,458
Lieutenant,
are you all right?

125
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,709
Yes, sir, I am...

126
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,166
fine.

127
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,750
I will send
your schedule, sir.

128
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,959
Excuse me.

129
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,000
(<i> grunting</i> )

130
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,667
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Enter.

131
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,000
Did the table
do something wrong?

132
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,500
No.

133
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,959
I'm glad you weren't
that hard on Ensign Lopez.

134
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,583
He made a mistake.

135
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,834
The duty roster
was inaccurate.

136
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:36,917
Would you like to talk
about what's bothering you

137
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:41,250
or would you like to break
some more furniture?

138
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,417
Today on the promenade,

139
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:53,959
a Yridian approached me.

140
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,917
He knew who I was and...

141
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:59,667
tried to sell me
information about Mogh.

142
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,500
Your father?

143
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,166
He claimed that he's alive

144
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,834
and is being held captive
in a Romulan prison camp.

145
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:14,083
Oh, my God.

146
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,709
Could it be true?

147
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:18,375
A Klingon would never
allow himself to be captured.

148
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,583
A warrior fights
to the death.

149
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,959
If my father were alive,
it would dishonor his sons

150
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,041
and their sons
for three generations.

151
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,625
Even Alexander would bear
the burden of guilt.

152
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,375
So you're willing
to ignore the possibility

153
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,750
because you're concerned
about dishonor?

154
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,375
My father is dead.

155
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,291
That Yridian
is selling lies.

156
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,792
If you're so sure about that,
why are you still so upset?

157
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,875
Worf, you can't deny
the possibility

158
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,291
just because you don't
want it to be true.

159
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:04,000
If you want to talk about this,
you know where to find me.

160
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,583
If we transfer
20 megajoules of energy

161
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,458
from the dilithium chamber
into the plasma inputs

162
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,750
it should be sufficient
to activate the device.

163
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,333
Hmm, it's worth a try.

164
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,875
You two can begin by connecting
the coil to the chamber.

165
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,625
I'll configure
the energy transfer.

166
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,333
Right.

167
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:31,583
Data, can I ask you
a personal question?

168
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,959
Certainly.

169
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,959
Does your hair grow?

170
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,000
I can control the rate of
my follicle replenishment.

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,917
However, I have not
yet had a reason

172
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,709
to modify
the length of my hair.

173
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:45,959
Why do you ask?
Oh, just curious.

174
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,125
Power conduits
are ready.

175
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,875
Is something wrong,
Doctor?

176
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,875
Well, you're breathing.
Yes.

177
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,792
I do have a functional
respiratory system.

178
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,834
However, its purpose
is to maintain

179
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,083
thermal control of
my internal systems.

180
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,041
I am, in fact,
capable of functioning

181
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,667
for extended periods
in a vacuum.

182
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,208
And you have a pulse.
Mmm.

183
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:22,667
My circulatory system not only
produces biochemical lubricants,

184
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:26,208
it regulates
micro-hydraulic power.

185
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:30,000
Most people are interested in
my extraordinary abilities--

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,125
how fast I can compute,
my memory capacity

187
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,917
how long I will live.

188
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,166
No one has ever asked me
if my hair will grow

189
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,583
or noticed that
I can breathe.

190
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,792
Well, your creator went
to a lot of trouble

191
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,000
to make you<i> seem</i> human.

192
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I find that fascinating.

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,625
Okay, I think we're ready
to begin the transfer.

194
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,333
Power connections
are complete.

195
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,291
I'll monitor
the coil's transfer rate.

196
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,917
Will you keep an eye on
the transient power response?

197
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:01,667
Of course.

198
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,041
We are ready, Geordi.

199
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,083
Okay.
Initiating energy transfer.

200
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,959
Power levels
are holding steady.

201
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,959
Transient response
is normal.

202
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,834
Hold on.
I'm picking up a power surge.

203
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:22,000
Reduce the transfer rate.

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,208
Reducing rate by 20%.

205
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,458
LA FORGE:
What happened?

206
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,208
BASHIR:
The power connections blew.

207
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,917
It sent out some kind
of plasma shock.

208
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:36,458
LA FORGE: His synaptic energy
is dropping...

209
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,709
(<i> distant metallic banging</i> )

210
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,500
(<i> banging continues</i> )

211
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,083
Data, are you
all right?

212
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:46,041
I believe so.
What has happened?

213
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,959
A plasma shock overloaded
your positronic net.

214
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,959
You were down
a good 30 seconds.

215
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,583
That cannot be possible.

216
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,375
I have a memory record
for that period of time.

217
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,375
I can recall
a series of images.

218
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:03,000
I saw Dr. Soong...

219
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,667
my father.

220
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,542
(<i> sighs</i> )

221
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:25,583
Data, I can't find
anything wrong

222
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,000
with your positronic
subprocessors or your
circuit controllers.

223
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,166
No sign of any residual
energy fluctuation.

224
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,959
Cascade overload...

225
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,542
My internal diagnostic indicates
that my memory systems

226
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:38,125
are functioning
within normal parameters.

227
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,875
For the 47 seconds
I was inactive,

228
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,208
there is no record
of cognitive activity.

229
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,041
Well, there's no doubt
about it, Data,

230
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,375
you were completely
shut down.

231
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,208
Maybe you had
some kind of...

232
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,208
random power fluctuation.

233
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,166
Caused you to access
one of your memory files.

234
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,625
That cannot be.

235
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,333
The image I saw was of
Dr. Soong as a young man.

236
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,417
I did not encounter him
until much later in his life.

237
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:05,000
There appears to be no rational
explanation for my experience.

238
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,417
Well, I'll take another
look at the diagnostic log.

239
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,709
In the meantime,

240
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,834
we'd better
disconnect that device.
Hmm.

241
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,000
Data...

242
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,125
perhaps we're going
about this the wrong way.
How so?

243
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,333
Well, maybe you had a dream
or a hallucination.

244
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,917
I am not capable of either
of those functions.

245
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:31,542
Yet, you can't account for
what happened today, can you?

246
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:34,625
At present, I cannot.

247
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,750
Well, maybe you should
approach this from a more
human standpoint.

248
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,417
You're right that machines
can't have hallucinations,

249
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,291
but then again,
most machines can't grow hair.

250
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,875
Wait.

251
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,250
What is it,
Commander?

252
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,250
I am sorry
to bother you,

253
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,291
but I have a question
of a personal nature.

254
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,750
Do you have a moment?

255
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,667
A moment.

256
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:24,709
I have heard you mention that
you once experienced a vision.

257
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,041
Yes, when I was young,

258
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,709
my adoptive parents
arranged for me

259
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:32,917
to partake in
the Rite of<i> MajQa.</i>

260
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:35,083
I understand it involves
deep meditation

261
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,041
in the lava caves
of No'Mat--

262
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,041
that prolonged exposure
to the heat

263
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,333
induces
a hallucinatory effect.

264
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,417
Why are you asking me
about this?

265
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:48,166
I have recently had
an unusual experience

266
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,208
which<i> might</i> be described
as a vision.

267
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,000
Well, what happened?

268
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,250
An accident in Engineering
shut down my cognitive functions

269
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,208
for a short period of time

270
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,208
yet... I seemed to
remain conscious.

271
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,166
I saw my father.

272
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,500
You are very fortunate.

273
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,250
That is a powerful vision.

274
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,375
If it was a vision,
I do not know how to proceed.

275
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,542
You must find
its meaning.

276
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,834
If it has anything
to do with your father,

277
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:22,083
you must learn
all you can about it.

278
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,792
In the Klingon
<i>MajQa</i> ritual,

279
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,625
there is nothing
more important

280
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:30,458
than receiving a revelation
about your father.

281
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:34,125
Your father is
a part of you...

282
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,375
always.

283
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:40,542
Learning about him
teaches you about yourself.

284
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,875
That is why,
no matter...

285
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,750
where he is
or what he has done...

286
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,542
you must find him.

287
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:57,375
But I am not looking
for my father.

288
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,375
Yes, of-of course.

289
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:05,375
Do not stop until
you have the answer.

290
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,750
Thank you, Worf.

291
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:54,917
Ah...
Lieutenant Worf.

292
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:58,000
You have reconsidered.

293
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,458
Yes, I wish to go to
the Romulan prison camp.

294
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,875
Excellent.

295
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,583
I can provide you
with the coordinates.

296
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,458
No.<i> You</i> will take me there.

297
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,125
No. It's not possible.

298
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,375
I have no means
of transportation.

299
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,291
I checked
the station records.

300
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,917
You have a vessel that is
capable of warp speed.

301
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:20,542
I... I do not have the time.

302
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:22,667
I have other business.

303
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,083
What is the real reason
you do not wish to take me?

304
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,500
Is it because what you
have told me is not true?

305
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,917
No, the camp is located

306
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:35,750
on the edge of Romulan space.

307
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,834
It is a dangerous journey.
Dangerous?

308
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:41,959
It would be more dangerous
for you to refuse.

309
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:44,834
Oh. Very well...

310
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,542
but I will require
full payment in advance.

311
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:49,709
No, no.
I will pay you after.

312
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:51,875
But...
(<i> grunting</i> )

313
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,417
Yes, yes.
Of course, after.

314
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:57,625
If you are lying,
if there is no prison camp...

315
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,750
No.
...I will kill you.

316
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh... oh...

317
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:11,083
(<i> panting</i> )

318
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:27,542
The Romulan guards have
a detection perimeter.

319
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,333
It will be necessary to
transport you to the surface,

320
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,792
30 kilometers
from the prison camp.

321
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,750
WORF:
The foliage is very dense.

322
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,959
It will take me approximately
12 hours to reach the camp.

323
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,166
I may have to travel
during the night.

324
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,000
That would be unwise.

325
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,333
This is not
an empty jungle.

326
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,000
There are many predators.

327
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,458
I am prepared.

328
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,875
Very well,
but I recommend

329
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:59,208
that you look up
from time to time.

330
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:03,417
The arboreal needle snake
likes to attack from above.

331
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:05,625
(<i> laughing</i> )

332
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:10,417
I will provide you
with a map of the camp.

333
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,375
How did you learn
of this camp?

334
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,208
It is not important
for you to know.

335
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,500
Why have you not informed
the Klingon government
of this place?

336
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,083
I<i> sell</i> information.

337
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,291
I do not give it away.

338
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,834
Ah, you do this for profit.

339
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,417
I have my reasons...

340
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,208
Mr. Worf.

341
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,917
What reasons could you have
for letting these people suffer?

342
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:46,458
We will arrive
in the Carraya sector

343
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,542
in approximately
three hours.

344
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:51,166
I suggest
you get some rest.

345
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:17,542
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come.

346
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:19,250
Yes, Mr. Data?

347
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,875
I am sorry
to disturb you, sir.

348
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,500
Ah, not at all.

349
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,583
I'm here studying
the intricacies

350
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,709
of Bajoran
aqueduct management.

351
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,875
I would welcome
a little interruption.

352
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,667
Please sit down.

353
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,458
I require
your advice, sir.

354
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,834
I have come to an impasse
regarding my recent

355
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,792
unexplained experience.

356
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,458
Hmm, your vision
of Dr. Soong.

357
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,000
How is your
investigation proceeding?

358
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,041
I have analyzed over
4,000 different religious

359
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,041
and philosophical systems,

360
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:52,041
as well as over 200
psychological schools of thought

361
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,583
in an effort to
understand what happened.

362
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,208
And what have you found?

363
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,583
I have been unable to find
a single interpretation

364
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,208
of the images I saw during
the time I was shut down.

365
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,875
The hammer, for instance,
has several meanings.

366
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:08,375
The Klingon culture views
the hammer as a symbol of power.

367
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:11,250
However, the Taqua Tribe
of Nagor sees it as an icon

368
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,208
of hearth and home.

369
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,166
The Ferengis view it
as a sign of sexual prowess.

370
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,041
I am curious,
Mr. Data.

371
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,625
Why are you looking at
all these other cultures?

372
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,625
The interpretation
of visions and other
metaphysical experiences

373
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,083
are almost always
culturally derived,

374
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,458
and I have no culture
of my own.

375
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,959
Yes, you do.

376
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,542
You're a culture of one,

377
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:36,583
which is no less valid than
a culture of one billion.

378
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,542
Perhaps the key

379
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:41,583
to understanding
your experience

380
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:44,375
is to stop looking into
other sources for meaning.

381
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:49,250
When we look at Michelangelo's
<i>David</i> or Symnay's<i> Tomb,</i>

382
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,625
we don't ask, "What does this
mean to other people?"

383
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:54,041
The real question is,
"What does it mean to<i> us?"</i>

384
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,959
Explore this image,
Data.

385
00:24:56,959 --> 00:25:00,375
Let it...
excite your imagination.

386
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,083
Focus on it.

387
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,041
See where it leads you.

388
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,959
Let it inspire you.

389
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,000
I believe I understand, sir.
Thank you.

390
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,667
Good luck, Mr. Data.

391
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:03,792
(<i> faint rustling</i> )

392
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,834
The camp is in
a southeasterly direction.

393
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:34,792
After approximately
ten kilometers,

394
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:37,709
you will come to the edge
of the sulfur canyon.

395
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:40,333
Look for a riverbank
and follow it

396
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,417
until you come to
the camp.

397
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:45,667
This is a homing device.

398
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:48,542
It will allow you to find
my ship when I return.

399
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:51,417
I will not be landing in
the same location.

400
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,542
When will you return?

401
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:55,458
50 hours.

402
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,709
Do not be late.

403
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:12,125
(<i> distant animal cries</i> )

404
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,709
(<i> distant animal cries</i> )

405
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,625
(<i> splashing</i> )

406
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:11,291
(<i> splashing continues</i> )

407

(<i> twig cracking</i> )

408
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,583
Who's there?

409
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,542
Toq... is that you?

410
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:53,917
I can see you.

411
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:57,250
I hope you're
enjoying yourself.

412
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:02,542
Toq, I swear,
I will hang you by your...

413
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:04,875
(<i> gasps</i> )

414
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:08,125
Stop!

415
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,875
Please.

416
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,291
Who are you?

417
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,000
I have come to help you.

418
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,208
Help me?
Yes.

419
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,875
How did you get out of camp?
Does anyone know you are gone?

420
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:21,917
Yes.
I come here often.

421
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:24,083
You must lead me
to the camp.

422
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:28,041
You are Klingon.
Where did you come from?

423
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:30,542
That does not matter.

424
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:32,125
I have come
to take you home.

425
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,834
Home?
This<i> is</i> my home.

426
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:36,166
(<i> footsteps</i> )

427
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,667
MALE:
Ba'el?

428
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:42,625
It is very important
you tell no one you saw me.

429
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,083
Have they begun
the ceremony?

430
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,959
Yes.
They're about to begin.

431
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,208
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come in.

432
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:15,333
Data, what are you doing?
We were supposed to meet at...

433
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:28,875
Data, what are you doing?

434
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,291
I am painting.

435
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:31,792
I can see that.

436
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:34,458
How long have you
been at this?

437
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:37,875
I have created
23 individual illustrations

438
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:40,834
in the past six hours,
27 minutes.

439
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:43,041
I believe you could say...

440
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,125
I have been inspired.

441
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,959
I'll say.

442
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:50,333
I have done
as Captain Picard suggested.

443
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,417
I have tried to
explore the images.

444
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,542
Has it helped?

445
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,375
I am not certain.

446
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:04,542
I began by painting

447
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,792
the image of
the blacksmith.

448
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,542
Hmm.

449
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:11,834
Then I painted
the corridor.

450
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:15,458
After that...

451
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,166
the anvil,
the hammer...

452
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,542
and Dr. Soong's face.

453
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,208
The thought
then occurred to me...

454
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,875
that I should paint smoke.

455
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,000
LA FORGE:
Smoke? Why smoke?

456
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,083
DATA:
I cannot explain it.

457
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:39,166
It is not an image
I saw during my vision.

458
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:41,709
Well, you have the smoke
coming out of a bucket of water.

459
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:44,709
Blacksmiths used to use
water to cool the metal.

460
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:47,417
Maybe that's why
you painted it.

461
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:49,250
Perhaps.

462
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,333
After I painted the smoke,

463
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:55,583
it then occurred to me...

464
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:58,542
to paint a bird's wing.

465
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,333
I then drew
an entire bird,

466
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,709
a flock of birds
flying in formation,

467
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,834
an individual feather.

468
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:09,750
If the image of the bird
is related to my vision,

469
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,792
I do not understand how.

470
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:16,125
I am left with more
of a mystery than ever.

471
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:19,625
Geordi, I would
like to re-create

472
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,750
the experiment which caused
my initial shutdown.

473
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,875
What for?

474
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,667
I do not know
how much longer

475
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:27,333
my vision would have continued
had I not been reactivated.

476
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:30,375
Data, that plasma shock
almost fused your neural net.

477
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,625
I don't think it's such
a good idea to try that again.

478
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,583
I am aware of
the risks involved,

479
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:38,041
but I can think of no other way
to investigate my experience.

480
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,709
Will you help?

481
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,083
(<i> sighs</i> )
Yeah.

482
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:44,583
Yeah, sure.

483
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,375
I'll go find Dr. Bashir.

484
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:49,583
I will prepare
the power transfer.

485
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:54,041
Okay, Data,
we're going to monitor

486
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,333
every subsystem
in your positronic net.

487
00:32:56,333 --> 00:33:00,417
If I see any neural pathways
overload beyond 65%,

488
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:02,375
I'm shutting down
the experiment.

489
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,500
Agreed.

490
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,417
We're ready.

491
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:15,583
Initiating
energy transfer.

492
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,083
Get ready, Data.

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,792

(<i> cawing</i> )

501
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,208
The bird did not appear
in my original experience.

502
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:10,166
This vision is different.

503
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,875
DR. SOONG:
Of course it's different.

504
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,750
It's never the same.

505
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,041
Always changing...

506
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,291
unpredictable.

(<i> laughs</i> )

508
00:35:23,709 --> 00:35:25,041
It doesn't make sense.

(<i> wings flapping</i> )

510
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,500
What is happening, Father?

511
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,792
I don't know, Data.

512
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,709
What<i> is</i> happening?

513
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:44,750
We are on the deck
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

514
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:50,500
My cat is present...

515
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,083
my potted plant...

516
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,250
and my paintings.

517
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,542
A beginning.

518
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,417
Still a little grounded

519
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:08,041
in the mundane, but...

520
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,125
showing promise.

521
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:13,083
I do not understand.

522
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,417
You're not supposed to.

523
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:22,500
No man should know where
his dreams come from.

524
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:26,291
It spoils the mystery...

525
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:28,083
the fun.

526
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,417
I'm proud of you, son.

527
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,750
I wasn't sure
you'd ever develop

528
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,709
the cognitive abilities
to make it this far.

529
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:47,291
But if you're here--

530
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,375
if you can see me--

531
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:52,875
you've crossed over
the threshold

532
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:55,000
from being
a collection

533
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,542
of circuits
and subprocessors

534
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:02,500
and have started
a wonderful journey.

535
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,750
What type of journey?

536
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,000
Think of it...

537
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:12,125
think of it as an empty sky.

538
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:18,625
I do not understand.

539
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:22,250
Shh.

540
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,417
Just dream, Data.

541
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:27,709
Dream.

542
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,917
Data...

543
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,959
you are the bird.

544
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:45,583
(<i> hammering</i> )

545
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,000
DATA: The images I saw during
the time I was shut down

546
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,333
were generated by a series
of previously dormant circuits

547
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,333
in my neural net.

548
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,375
I believe Dr. Soong
incorporated those circuits

549
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:40,208
into my base programming,
intending to activate them

550
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,458
once I had reached a certain
level of development.

551
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,125
But the plasma shock
activated them prematurely.

552
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,333
That is correct.

553
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,917
I'm curious.

554
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,417
Now that those
circuits<i> are</i> active,

555
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:50,959
what are you going
to do with them?

556
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,834
I plan to shut down
my cognitive functions

557
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:54,458
for a brief period
each day.

558
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,208
I hope to generate
new internal visions.

559
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,834
It sounds to me like you're
talking about dreaming.

560
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:00,250
An accurate analogy.

561
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,625
Remarkable.

562
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,583
You know, this is
just the kind of thing

563
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:06,709
that might get me published
in the<i> Starfleet Cybernetics</i>
<i>Journal.</i>

564
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,750
Would you mind if I authored
a paper on all this?

565
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,417
Of course not.

566
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:11,917
Thank you, Data.

567
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,291
And... sweet dreams.

568
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,000
Hmm.

I'm a friend.

Who...
who are you?

589
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,291
Worf.
Son of Mogh.

590
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,041
Why have you come here?

591
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:33,709
I've come to find
my father.

592
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:37,291
Is he alive?
Is he here?

593
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:41,000
Your father fell
at Khitomer.

594
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:50,000
Did he... die in battle?

595
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,417
He was fortunate.

596
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,083
You were captured?

597
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,792
Yes.

598
00:41:57,792 --> 00:42:00,750
The Romulans--

599
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,041
they robbed you of
your right to die in battle.

600
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,750
There is very little time.

601
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,792
How many Klingons
are being held here?

602
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:12,333
Seventy-three.

603
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,792
How many Romulans
guard the camp?

604
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:16,625
Worf, there are things
you do not understand.

605
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,041
What do you mean?

606
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:21,291
I must... I must speak
with the elders.

607
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,250
(<i> grunts</i> )

608
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:34,834
<i>Ghos!</i>

609
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,792
I knew your father
well, Worf.

610
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:45,208
And I remember you--

611
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,625
a boy...

612
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:50,583
barely able to lift
a<i> bat'leth.</i>

613
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:55,125
Once, your father insisted
we take you on the ritual hunt.

614
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,834
You were so eager,

615
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:59,750
you tried to take the beast
with your bare hands.

616
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,792
It mauled your arm.

617
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,333
I still have the scar.

618
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:14,750
I<i> do</i> remember you now.

619
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,959
You should not
have come here, Worf.

620
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:22,959
I do not understand.

621
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:25,959
You should not have come.

622
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,583
Who is this?

623
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,500
I'm Worf, son of Mogh.

624
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,917
I have come
to help you escape.

625
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:35,208
He does not know.

626
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,542
He must leave at once.

627
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:38,250
No, it is too late
for that now.

628
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,291
He would bring others.

We are not leaving here

632
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:55,834
and neither are you.
