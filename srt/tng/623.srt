1
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,250
Good morning,
Commander.

2
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:12,667
Data.

3
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:13,834
Interesting night?

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,333
I found it extremely
interesting.

5
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,000
The lateral
sensor arrays

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,041
ran three separate
spectral analyses

7
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,417
on the Alawanir Nebula

8
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,917
on three distinct
frequencies.

9
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:24,417
I'm sorry I missed it.

10
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,500
I will have the report
sent to you, sir.

11
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:28,917
We are still on course
for the Gariman Sector.

12
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:32,125
Our speed is warp six.
ETA: 1300 hours.

13
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,291
Sick bay reported
one minor injury

14
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,458
in the Exobiology
Department at 0420 hours.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,041
Very well.

16
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,375
Isn't Lieutenant Worf scheduled
to replace Ensign Torigan?

17
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,083
Yes, sir.
I was not informed

18
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,250
of any change
in the duty roster.

19
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,959
He's never late.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,667
Riker to Lieutenant Worf.

21
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,208
Computer,
locate Lieutenant Worf.

22
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,125
COMPUTER:
Lieutenant Worf
is in his quarters.

23
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,542
Something's wrong.

24
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,583
Mr. Data, you have the bridge.

25
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,583
Security team, meet me on
deck seven, section 25-Baker.

26
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,375
CREW MEMBER:
Aye, sir.

27
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,834
(<i> beeping</i> )

28
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,709
(<i> beeping</i> )

29
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,333
Computer,

30
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,750
override security lock
on this door.

31
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,125
Authorization:
Riker-Alpha-six-zero.

32
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:35,041
WORF:
<i>Torva... luk... do...</i>

33
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,625
<i>shell.</i>

34
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,542
<i>Torva...</i>

35
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,917
Worf...

36
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,959
what the hell
are you doing?

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,333
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

38
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:24,542
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

39
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,375
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

40
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:29,166
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

41
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:34,291
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

42
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:39,375
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

43
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,417
(<i> door chimes</i> )

44
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,500
Enter.

45
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,583
Captain...

46
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,375
On your feet, Lieutenant.

47
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,250
Sir.

48
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,333
Mr. Worf, your personal affairs
are strictly your own concern

49
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,834
until they interfere
with the operation of this ship.

50
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,834
You have now crossed that line.

51
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,500
As your captain, I want to know
exactly what is going on.

52
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:16,458
It is difficult
to explain.

53
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,291
Try.

54
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,417
Ever since I returned
from the Carraya System,

55
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,291
I have felt... empty.

56
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,959
Does this have something to do
with the Klingons you rescued

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
from Carraya IV?

58
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,041
They were young.

59
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,625
They knew nothing
of their heritage.

60
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:37,375
So while I was there,
I tried to teach them--

61
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,750
teach them about
their people,

62
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:41,291
their culture.

63
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:45,083
I told them our
ancient stories,

64
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,125
instructed them
in our customs,

65
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,375
explained
our beliefs.

66
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:50,583
And then I told them
about Kahless--

67
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,542
how he had united our people
long ago,

68
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,000
how he gave us
strength and honor,

69
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,333
and how he promised
to return one day

70
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,000
and lead us again.

71
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,291
Is that what you're
doing here?

72
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,583
Trying to recapture
those feelings?

73
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,917
Yes.

74
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,834
I was trying to summon
a vision of Kahless.

75
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,750
It's a pity that you
didn't try the holodeck

76
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,625
instead of setting fire
to your quarters.

77
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,709
Using the holodeck
would not have
been appropriate.

78
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,250
Everything
had to be real

79
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,041
if Kahless
were to appear.

80
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,917
But all this...

81
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,417
is for nothing.

82
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,625
He did not come to me.

83
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:40,959
I gave Toq and the others
a belief in<i> sto-vo-kor,</i>

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,375
the life which lies
beyond this life

85
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:45,792
where Kahless awaits us.

86
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:48,458
When I saw the power
of their beliefs,

87
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,500
I began to question
the strength of my own,

88
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:56,500
and I found it...
wanting.

89
00:05:56,542 --> 00:06:00,458
Have you lost your faith
in<i> sto-vo-kor?</i>

90
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,792
To lose something

91
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:03,792
one must first
possess it.

92
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:07,250
I am not sure I ever
had a true belief.

93
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,083
But I should not have
allowed it to interfere
with my duties.

94
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,709
My behavior has been--
Inexcusable.

95
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,041
And understandable.

96
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,375
It may be
that what you are looking for

97
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,375
cannot be found
here on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

98
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:32,542
Perhaps you need
to immerse yourself
in Klingon beliefs

99
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:36,792
in order to discover
if they can hold
any truths for you.

100
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

101
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,458
Is there...
something you can do?

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,542
Is there somewhere you could go

103
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,542
to explore your faith
more fully?

104
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,667
Boreth.

105
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,500
The followers of Kahless
await his return there.

106
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,333
To Klingons, there is
no more sacred place.

107
00:06:55,375 --> 00:07:00,417
Mmm. And Boreth is only 12 days
from here by shuttle.

108
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:05,291
As of this moment, Mr. Worf,
you are on leave.

109
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,375
Thank you, sir.

110
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:10,834
But when you set foot
on this ship again,

111
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:15,458
I expect you
to perform your duties
like a Starfleet officer.

112
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,709
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,291
And, Mr. Worf...

114
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,250
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

115
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,834
Thank you, sir.

116
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:49,500
(<i> voices chanting quietly</i> ):
<i>Torva... luk... do... shell.</i>

117
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:52,917
<i>Torva... luk...</i>

118
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,750
<i>do... shell.</i>

119
00:07:55,792 --> 00:08:02,083
<i>Torva... luk... do... shell.</i>

120
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:07,917
<i>Torva... luk...</i>
<i>do... shell.</i>

121
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,333
<i>Torva... luk... do...</i>

122
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,208
Kahless!

123
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,417
I see Kahless!

124
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:18,417
He is standing
before me with a sword.

125
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,917
He wants something.

126
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,750
Me.

127
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,875
He wants me.

128
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:28,291
He wants me
to go with him!

129
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:33,041
It is a powerful vision
you have had, Divok.

130
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,625
Kahless wants you to join him
in<i> sto-vo-kor.</i>

131
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,417
You're only 19,
and yet your place

132
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,500
among the honored dead
is already secure.

133
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:43,709
Take him back
to his chamber.

134
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,458
Let him sleep.

135
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,667
You're leaving us?

136
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,375
It has been ten
days, Koroth.

137
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,375
I have had no visions.

138
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,667
I have received no insight.

139
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,959
There is nothing here for me.

140
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,458
What is the story
of the promise, Worf?

141
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,500
When Kahless
had united our people

142
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,750
and gave them
the laws of honor,

143
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,875
he saw that his work was done.

144
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,709
So, one night, he gathered
his belongings

145
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,959
and departed
for the edge of the city
to say good-bye.

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,041
The people wept.

147
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:36,542
They did not
want him to go.

148
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Then Kahless said,
"You are Klingons.

149
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:44,208
"You need no one
but yourselves.

150
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,250
"I will go now
to<i> sto-vo-kor,</i>

151
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,834
but I promise one day
I will return."

152
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,792
Then Kahless pointed
to a star in the sky

153
00:09:54,834 --> 00:10:01,083
and said, "Look for me there
on that point of light."

154
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,959
So, here we are...

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,583
on a world circling
that distant point of light.

156
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,583
It has been 15 centuries
since he made that promise

157
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,291
and still we wait.

158
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:20,291
What are ten days
in the life of one Klingon

159
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,291
compared to that?

160
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:27,291
Is the son of Mogh
really so easily discouraged?

161
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,959
You came to us
seeking answers,

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,166
but this is a place
of questions.

163
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,667
Open your heart
to Kahless.

164
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:40,083
Ask him your questions,

165
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,291
let him speak to you

166
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,625
with your mind unclouded
by doubt or hesitation.

167
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:49,458
Only then can you find
what you are looking for.

168
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,875
If you cannot do that,

169
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:57,291
then perhaps you should
return to your starship.

170
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:06,417
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

171
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:15,667
<i>...Luk... do... shell.</i>

172
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:22,250
<i>Torva... luk...</i>
<i>do... shell.</i>

173
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,041
<i>Torva... luk...</i>

174
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,166
I see Kahless.

175
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,750
(<i> gasps</i> )

176
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:01,709
You are real.

177
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,500
I am Kahless,

178
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,625
and I have returned.

179
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,625
What are you doing?

180
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:38,959
Who are you?

181
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,417
It is Kahless.

182
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,000
I have returned.

183
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,250
You doubt me.

184
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,625
Who here knows the story

185
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,834
of how this sword
was forged?

186
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,291
No one knows.

187
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,709
It is not written
in the sacred texts.

188
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,041
I went into the mountains,

189
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,417
all the way to the volcano
at Kri'stak.

190
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,625
There I cut off
a lock of my hair

191
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,709
and thrust it
into the river of molten rock

192
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,250
that poured
from the summit.

193
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,959
The hair
began to burn.

194
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,709
Then I plunged it
into the Lake of Lusor

195
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,834
and twisted it
into this sword.

196
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:35,125
And after I used it
to kill Molor,

197
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,458
I gave it a name...

198
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,125
<i>Bat'leth--</i>

199
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,709
the sword of honor.

200
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,166
You<i> know.</i>

201
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,125
The story of the sword

202
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,458
is known only
to the high clerics.

203
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,250
It was never written down

204
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,625
so that if
he returned,

205
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,625
we could be sure
it was Kahless.

206
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,959
I have returned

207
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,792
because there is a
great need in my people.

208
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:05,250
They fight amongst themselves
in petty wars

209
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,208
that corrupt the glory
of the Klingon spirit.

210
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,083
They have lost their way...

211
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,583
but it is not too late.

212
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,417
I have returned,

213
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:20,208
and I will lead
my people again.

214
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,291
<i>Vorch-doh-baghk, Kahless.</i>

215
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:31,875
ALL:
<i>Vorch-doh-baghk, Kahless.</i>

216
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:36,250
<i>Vorch-doh-baghk, Kahless.</i>

217
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,667
What is it
you are doing?

218
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,625
I was getting my tricorder.

219
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,709
Tricorder?

220
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,417
Is it a weapon?

221
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,041
No. No. It is a tool.

222
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,834
I intended to use it
to see if...

223
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,125
To see if I was real.

224
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,041
Proceed.

225
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,208
Use your tricorder.

226
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,083
(<i> laughing</i> )

227
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,667
Well?

228
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,250
You are Klingon.

229
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,208
What else could I be?

230
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,125
There are many possibilities--

231
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,583
a shape-shifter,
a holographic projection.

232
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,834
So, you are
a skeptic, Worf.

233
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,375
I like that.

234
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:40,959
How do you know
my name?

235
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,291
We have met before.

236
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:47,792
I appeared to you in a vision
in the caves of No'mat.

237
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:50,375
You were just
a child then.

238
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,750
I told you that you
would do something

239
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:58,083
that no Klingon
had ever done before.

240
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:04,709
You still do not believe
it is me do you, Worf?

241
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,041
I want to believe.

242
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:13,333
That is a beginning.

243
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:21,542
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

244
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,500
Gowron is the leader
of the council.

245
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,125
He commands
the entire defense force.

246
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,917
If he chooses
to oppose you...

247
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,500
Do not worry.

248
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:39,041
We are on the threshold
of a new era for our people.

249
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,208
Klingons from all
over the empire

250
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,083
will flock
to my banner.

251
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,458
And yet...

252
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,583
something still weighs heavy
on the brow of the son of Mogh.

253
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,208
Are you
contemplating

254
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,125
yet another
question for me?

255
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:59,417
After three days,
I am beginning to wonder

256
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,500
if you know
how to do anything else.

257
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:05,083
Questions are
the beginning of wisdom,

258
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,875
the mark of a true warrior.

259
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:10,250
Do not forget that a leader
need not answer questions

260
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,250
of those he leads.

261
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,917
It is enough
that he says to do a thing

262
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,291
and they will do it.

263
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,583
If he says to run,
they run.

264
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,250
If he says to fight,
they fight.

265
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,333
If he says to die...

266
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,250
they die.

267
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:32,125
If the commander
is worthy of that trust.

268
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,458
(<i> speaking Klingon</i> )

269
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:55,959
(<i> grunting</i> )

270
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,458
(<i> laughing</i> )

271
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,458
What is wrong?

272
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,208
Is there only anger
and bloodlust in your souls?

273
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,542
Is that all that is left
in the Klingon heart?

274
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,041
We do not fight
merely to spill blood,

275
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,250
but to enrich
the spirit.

276
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,959
Look at us--

277
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,625
two warriors
locked in battle,

278
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,125
fighting for honor!

279
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:59,792
How can you not sing
for all to hear?

280
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:02,333
"We are Klingons!"

281
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,792
(<i> laughing</i> )

282
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:07,750
Yes.

283
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,250
Let it out.

284
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,208
Let the joy in your
heart be heard.

285
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,959
We are Klingon!

286
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
We are Klingon.

287
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,917
(<i> laughing</i> )

288
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,875
ALL:
We are Klingons!

289
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:25,041
We are Klingons!
We are Klingons!

290
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,458
We are Klingons!

291
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,041
We are Klingons!

292
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,458
We are Klingons!

293
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,417
We are Klingons!

294
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,917
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46852.2.</i>

295
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:42,875
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is to proceed</i>
<i>directly to the planet Boreth</i>

296
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:46,875
<i>to take aboard</i>
<i>a very unusual guest.</i>

297
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:50,041
Did you take any other
tricorder readings--

298
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,000
an anatomical profile
or a neurophysiology scan?

299
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,417
No.

300
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,458
It's going to be
very difficult

301
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,333
to eliminate any possibilities
at this point.

302
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,375
He may be a coalescent
being taking Klingon form,

303
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,083
or a bioreplicant,

304
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,208
or even a Klingon who has
been surgically altered

305
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,458
to look like Kahless.

306
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,583
WORF:
There is another
possibility.

307
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,542
He could be the real Kahless.

308
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,250
He may have actually
returned as he promised.

309
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,250
The appearance of Kahless
in the lava caves

310
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,875
is consistent
with the stories

311
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,583
found in the Klingon
sacred texts.

312
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:25,458
Worf, no offense,
but I have trouble believing

313
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,542
that the man that I escorted
from deck eight is supernatural.

314
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,125
I did not say that he is.

315
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:35,250
I merely think
we should not completely
reject the possibility.

316
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,166
Look, we have no reason
to rule out anything.

317
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:42,792
We are not ordered
to investigate
the origins of our guest,

318
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,041
nor to tell anyone
what they should believe.

319
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,041
We are simply to transport
Kahless to the homeworld.

320
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,041
And while he's here with us,

321
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,750
he will be treated
as an honored guest.

322
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,875
Lieutenant.

323
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,667
May I ask a question?

324
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,583
In the absence
of empirical data,

325
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,542
how will you determine
whether or not
this is the real Kahless?

326
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,834
It is not an
empirical matter.

327
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,834
It is a matter of... faith.

328
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,333
Faith.

329
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,542
Then you do believe
Kahless may have

330
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,333
supernatural attributes.

331
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,750
As an android,
I am unable to accept

332
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,959
that which cannot be proven
through rational means.

333
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,125
I would appreciate hearing
your insights on this matter.

334
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,375
Perhaps some other time,
Commander.

335
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:38,041
I... do not believe
I can provide much...

336
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,208
insight
at this moment.

337
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:58,458
Welcome aboard, Gowron.

338
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,709
Where is he, Picard?

339
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,291
I assume that you
are referring to Kahless.

340
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,625
I am referring
to the filthy<i> pahtak</i>

341
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,166
who is using his name.

342
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:11,458
Well, the person
in question

343
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,792
is in his quarters
at the moment.

344
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,500
What have you learned
about him so far?

345
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,417
What kind of medical
analysis have you made?

346
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,333
Do you have any theories
about his true origin?

347
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,917
We haven't done any analysis.

348
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:24,542
What kind of fools
do you have working
for you, Picard?

349
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,208
The impostor's been aboard
for nearly a day.

350
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,875
If you had wanted
to run tests on Kahless,

351
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,792
you should have sent
a Klingon ship for him.

352
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,625
And have him begin spreading
his poisonous lies

353
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:35,375
through a ship
of loyal Klingons? Never.

354
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:38,041
If he really is an impostor,
then you have
nothing to worry about.

355
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,959
Kahless has been dead
for 1,000 years,

356
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,333
but the idea of Kahless
is still alive.

357
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,667
Have you ever fought
an idea, Picard?

358
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,125
It has no weapon
to destroy,

359
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,792
no body to kill.

360
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:51,750
The idea of Kahless' return
must be stopped here, now,

361
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:54,917
or it will travel through
the empire like a wave

362
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:58,917
and leave nothing
but destruction behind.

363
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,792
So, Gowron has come on board
in order to test your claim.

364
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:12,333
Gowron knows that
his days are nearly over.

365
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:15,667
Now he comes crawling aboard
with some kind of test.

366
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,500
We do not have to prove
anything to Gowron.

367
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:19,500
What is this test?

368
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,709
He has brought a knife
with him--

369
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,000
a knife that is supposed
to be stained

370
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,625
with the blood of Kahless.

371
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,500
Gowron has brought
the knife of Kirom?

372
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,333
No one is permitted
to remove it

373
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,875
from the sacred vault.

374
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:32,166
Gowron does not care
about what is sacred.

375
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,500
He wants to run
a genetic analysis

376
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:37,208
on a sample of the blood,
and on you.

377
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,875
That should tell us
if there is a biological match.

378
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,375
Now, if you agree
to the test,

379
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,792
I will make the<i> Enterprise</i>
facilities available

380
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:46,709
to ensure that it is
conducted impartially.

381
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,250
Perhaps it is time
to settle the doubts

382
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:55,166
of those who still
do not believe.

383
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,250
I will allow this test.

384
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,875
There, that should do it.

385
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,291
Computer, run
a genetic comparison
on this blood sample

386
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:15,542
and the tissue
belonging to Kahless.

387
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,166
COMPUTER: The genetic patterns
are identical.

388
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,750
But how?

389
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,709
How can this be?

390
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,667
It is true.

391
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,792
Kahless has returned.

392
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:41,959
Ah...

393
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,583
I am sorry.

394
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:49,291
Our replicators
do not do justice
to Klingon<i> warnog.</i>

395
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:59,500
It's been so long
since I have tasted
any food or drink.

396
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,667
There are many things
I have forgotten.

397
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:10,291
Kahless...

398
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:14,208
May I ask you about... death...

399
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,083
and<i> sto-vo-kor?</i>

400
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,625
Tell me--

401
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:22,375
what awaits us
beyond this life?

402
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:27,125
I do not have
those answers.

403
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,917
I am merely a traveler--

404
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:30,875
someone who has journeyed
back and forth

405
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:33,291
between this world
and the next.

406
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,417
While I am in this form,

407
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:38,375
I know only
about this world.

408
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,709
And there is
much work for me to do
in this world.

409
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,208
And you will be
part of it, Worf.

410
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,875
Me?

411
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:50,542
It was<i> your</i> purity
of heart

412
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,291
that summoned me
back from<i> sto-vo-kor.</i>

413
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:56,542
And Koroth has told me
about the respect
you have earned

414
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,750
in the Federation
and the empire.

415
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:01,959
I want you to have
a place at my side

416
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,875
as we restore honor
to our people.

417
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:12,166
Let me tell you
about this new empire
we will forge.

418
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:17,875
It will be<i> glorious!</i>

419
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:19,166
It will be<i> war!</i>

420
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

421
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,166
You're not a fool, Worf.

422
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,500
Do you really think
that every Klingon
in the empire

423
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:29,250
will bend his knee
and grovel before this man

424
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:32,917
just because Koroth
says he is Kahless?

425
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,166
He<i> is</i> Kahless.

426
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,709
Your own test
proved it.

427
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,625
I will not hand over
the empire to Koroth

428
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,291
because of one test.

429
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,041
It is not Koroth, it is...

430
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,834
Of course, it is Koroth!

431
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,834
Open your eyes!

432
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:52,959
Koroth and the other guardians
have always opposed me.

433
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,500
This is nothing more
than a ploy for them
to finally seize power.

434
00:26:56,542 --> 00:27:00,291
Even now, there are warriors
on my own ship

435
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,709
who want to see Kahless.

436
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,750
There are others who believe
he is an impostor.

437
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,250
The divisions
are already forming.

438
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:11,333
But it does not have
to be this way.

439
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:14,750
We could all join together
and welcome Kahless

440
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,500
as a united people.

441
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,208
Don't you see?

442
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,875
This is exactly why
they want<i> you</i> to join them,

443
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:24,875
because your brother
sits on the council,

444
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:28,667
and your voice carries weight
in the empire.

445
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:32,583
They want you to influence
others to follow them.

446
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,417
Worf...

447
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:37,667
we fought together
once, side by side,

448
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:40,500
to keep the empire
from being torn apart.

449
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:44,625
Will you stand by
and let these
impostors destroy

450
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:48,625
all that we fought
so hard to protect?

451
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,208
Renounce him, Worf.

452
00:27:54,250 --> 00:28:00,166
Stand with me
and we can hold
the empire...

453
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,792
together.

454
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,917
You do not understand.
Kahless<i> is</i> our future.

455
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:09,250
Only with his help

456
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:12,667
can we revive the pure warriors
within ourselves.

457
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:15,250
Listen to him, Gowron.

458
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,750
Open your heart.
Hear his words.

459
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:23,083
He will restore your faith
as he has restored mine.

460
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:26,291
Give him a chance to lift
your spirit

461
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:30,583
and cleanse your heart
before you take up arms.

462
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,709
Koroth...

463
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,166
I see that not all
fools die young.

464
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:50,667
(<i> laughing</i> )

465
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,792
Kahless.

466
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,125
KOROTH:
Kahless, may I present Gowron,

467
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,291
leader
of the high council.

468
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,125
Kahless.

469
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Long ago, a storm was heading
toward the city of Quin'lat.

470
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:19,208
The people sought protection
within the walls--

471
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,834
all except one man
who remained outside.

472
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:25,166
I went to him and asked
what he was doing.

473
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:28,458
"I am not afraid," he said.

474
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,041
"I will not hide my face
behind stone and mortar.

475
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:38,250
I will stand before the wind
and make it respect me."

476
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:41,625
I honored his choice
and went inside.

477
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:44,583
The next day,
the storm came

478
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:48,250
and the man was killed.

479
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:53,625
The wind does not
respect a fool.

480
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:58,000
Do not stand
before the wind, Gowron.

481
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:00,917
What was his name?

482
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:04,959
What?

483
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,041
If you were really there,

484
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:09,250
you should be able to tell us

485
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:12,250
the name of the man
outside the walls.

486
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,917
Describe him to us.

487
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,291
What was he wearing?

488
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:20,125
How tall was he?

489
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,041
What color were his eyes?!

490
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:25,250
I do not remember.

491
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:28,875
It was long ago
and in another lifetime.

492
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:31,417
What matters is I have returned

493
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:34,834
to restore faith and hope
to my people,

494
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:38,208
to lead them back
to the way of honor

495
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,709
and the glory
that once was theirs

496
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,625
and can be again.

497
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,542
Is that
what you oppose, Gowron?

498
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:48,000
I oppose you.

499
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,458
I say you are
not Kahless.

500
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,834
(<i> grunts</i> )

501
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:54,375
And I will not
bend my knee to you...

502
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:58,834
as long as I can draw breath...

503
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:01,083
or pick up a blade.

504
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,917
(<i> grunts</i> )

505
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,709
KOROTH:
No!

506
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,542
Koroth!

507
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,291
(<i> grunting</i> )

508
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:28,250
Good try, Gowron,
but not enough.

509
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:29,792
(<i> grunts</i> )

510
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,792
(<i> Kahless laughing</i> )

511
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,959
You have no joy, Gowron.

512
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,667
Is your heart so full
of mistrust and suspicion

513
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,542
that you've forgotten
what it means

514
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:50,792
to be truly Klingon?

515
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:54,291
(<i> Gowron grunting angrily</i> )

516
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,625
Kahless...

517
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,583
the greatest warrior
of them all.

518
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,709
(<i> Gowron laughing</i> )

519
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,375
Everything will
be all right.

520
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:23,375
We will say that...
that Gowron used a
dishonorable tactic

521
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:24,875
in his fight
with Kahless.

522
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:26,792
That he cheated.
That is a lie.
He did not--

523
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:29,125
We do not need
to hear any more
from the son of Mogh.

524
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,542
None of this would
have happened

525
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:31,834
if you had not brought
them together.

526
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,166
I am Kahless.

527
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:34,834
I am the strongest,
the bravest warrior.

528
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,000
Do not think
about what happened.

529
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:39,458
You must think of the future,
of the empire.

530
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,667
There is no future here,

531
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,500
no glorious new era
for our people.

532
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,333
Gowron was right.

533
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:49,542
You did not know the name
of the man who faced the storm.

534
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:52,333
You do not even know
what real<i> warnog</i> tastes like,

535
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,709
and you certainly are not
the greatest warrior of all.

536
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,500
Whoever you are,
you are not Kahless.

537
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,709
You have said enough.
Now get out!

538
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,125
You are using
the name of Kahless
for some twisted game.

539
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:07,417
For that alone,
you should die.

540
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:08,959
And if you do not tell me
what you have done,

541
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,667
I will kill you right here!

542
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:14,375
(<i> sighs</i> )

543
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:16,250
Problems with
your memory

544
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:20,959
are the result
of the way
you returned.

545
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,667
What do you mean?

546
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,125
We, the guardians,

547
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:26,291
have been awaiting your
return for centuries,

548
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,542
but we did not have
the technology

549
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,792
to bring you back until now.

550
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:34,250
We were able to use
an organic sample

551
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:37,667
of the first Kahless
to give you life.

552
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:39,917
The first Kahless?

553
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,750
A clone.

554
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:49,458
He is a clone.

555
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,125
What is a clone?

556
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:54,250
A being created
in a laboratory

557
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,959
by using genetic material
from another being.

558
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,917
You are a copy, a fraud!

559
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,709
You are not<i> just</i> a copy.

560
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,375
We gave you more than
the body of Kahless.

561
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,083
We found a way to imprint
specific information

562
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,583
in your neurosynaptic patterns.

563
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,959
We gave you memories,
and not just any memories.

564
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,542
We gave you the experiences
of Kahless

565
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,959
as written
in the sacred texts.

566
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,417
So...

567
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:22,792
I did not do any
of the things
that I remember.

568
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:27,083
I was never in the
city of Quin'lat.

569
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,458
I never went
to the Kri'stak
volcano.

570
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,125
You were not awakened
until we transported
you into the cave

571
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,834
and you appeared
to Worf.

572
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,000
Before that, you were
unconscious in a laboratory

573
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,041
where we accelerated
your growth,

574
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,458
corrected any genetic
anomalies that occurred,

575
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,041
gave you the wisdom
and memories that...

576
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:47,667
(<i> chuckling</i> )

577
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:52,250
They grew you
in a test tube
like some kind of fungus

578
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:55,667
and programmed you
like a machine.

579
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:57,375
You are twisting the truth.

580
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:59,959
You talk to me of truth.

581
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,667
You who have brought to life
this lie and called it Kahless.

582
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:04,875
It is not a lie.

583
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:07,333
Genetically, he<i> is</i> Kahless,

584
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,834
and he is needed
by our people.

585
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,125
You know better than anyone
the corruption and dishonor

586
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,875
that is destroying the empire.

587
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:14,959
They need him.

588
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,125
They do not need a<i> false</i> god!

589
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,458
How do you know
that this was not the way

590
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,291
the prophecy was
to be fulfilled?

591
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:23,500
Who is to say
that what we did was wrong?

592
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:24,959
I am.

593
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,750
I will not let this fraud
continue.

594
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:29,917
Worf!

595
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,583
You cannot tell Gowron of this.

596
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:37,291
Do not give me orders,
Koroth.

597
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,583
All right, but consider this.

598
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:44,000
If you tell Gowron
what we have told you,

599
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,333
it will destroy him,

600
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:49,125
and with him
the last chance

601
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:52,792
to restore hope
to our people.

602
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:55,542
It's your choice.

603
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:14,041
(<i> Klingons chanting</i> )

604
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:20,792
They have been sitting here
for three hours, 17 minutes.

605
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,917
They refused to return
to their ship

606
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:24,959
with the rest
of Gowron's men.

607
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,542
They insisted
upon waiting here

608
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,667
until they see
Kahless again.

609
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:31,667
Their faith appears
to be unaffected

610
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:34,750
by his inability
to defeat Gowron.

611
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,458
They still believe.

612
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,625
Then they are fools.

613
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:41,917
Does that mean you
no longer believe

614
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,458
this is the
real Kahless?

615
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,041
Yes.

616
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,458
I am curious.

617
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,959
Do you still think
the real Kahless
will return someday,

618
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,041
or has this experience
only deepened the
spiritual crisis

619
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,166
which originally
sent you to Boreth?

620
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:03,333
I do not know.

621
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,125
I understand your dilemma.

622
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,625
I once had what could
be considered

623
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:09,125
a crisis of the spirit.

624
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:11,917
You?
Yes.

625
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:13,500
The Starfleet officers

626
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,959
who first activated me
on Omicron Theta

627
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,750
told me I was an android,

628
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:21,750
nothing more than a
sophisticated machine
with human form.

629
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,041
However, I realized that
if I were simply a machine,

630
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:27,333
I could never be anything else.

631
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:30,041
I could never grow
beyond my programming.

632
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,667
I found that
difficult to accept,

633
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:37,333
so I chose to believe
that I was a person,

634
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,917
that I had the potential
to be more than a collection

635
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:42,375
of circuits and
subprocessors.

636
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:45,333
It is a belief
which I still hold.

637
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:52,166
How did<i> you</i> come
to your decision?

638
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:57,709
I made... a leap of faith.

639
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:18,583
The man who appeared to me
on Boreth is<i> not</i> Kahless.

640
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,000
He is a clone.

641
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,542
A clone?

642
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:23,709
Yes.

643
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,125
Did you really think

644
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,917
you could get away with this
kind of fraud, Koroth?

645
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:30,583
I will have you and this
abomination put to death.

646
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,333
It does not matter, Gowron.

647
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:34,041
You will still not be able
to stand against him.

648
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:37,000
What?

649
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:39,542
He's not real.
You just said so.

650
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,542
I said he was not Kahless.

651
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,625
But, in the minds
of our people,

652
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,000
he can be just as
powerful as Kahless.

653
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,792
Even now, two members
of your own crew

654
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:52,583
are sitting on our holodeck
waiting for him to return.

655
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,750
I do not care
what they think.

656
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,875
But they are not alone.

657
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,250
Like many of our people,

658
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:00,625
they need something
to believe in,

659
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:04,083
just like I did-- something
larger than themselves,

660
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,959
something that will give
their lives meaning.

661
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,917
They need Kahless.

662
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,375
But when they find out
the truth...

663
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:12,041
It does not matter,
Gowron.

664
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,625
Despite the facts,
they will still believe.

665
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:19,250
They will make
a leap of faith,

666
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,792
and there will be
others just like them--

667
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:24,000
not everyone, but enough

668
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,667
to plunge the empire
into civil war

669
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:27,000
if you oppose them.

670
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:28,375
What are you saying?

671
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,917
That I should just hand over
the empire?

672
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:34,500
No, that would be
unwise as well.

673
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:37,667
Then what are you
proposing, Worf?

674
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:43,375
You were right about
one thing, Koroth.

675
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:47,917
Our people are becoming
decadent and corrupt.

676
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:50,959
They need
moral leadership.

677
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,959
Kahless can be that leader--

678
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,583
as emperor.

679
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:59,917
There hasn't been an emperor
in three centuries.

680
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:03,583
The political power will remain
with the high council.

681
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,125
Kahless would be a figurehead.

682
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:08,959
But he will have the ability
to rally the people,

683
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,500
to lead by example,

684
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,792
to guide them
in spiritual matters.

685
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:14,625
The title is meaningless

686
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:16,875
without the power
to back it up.

687
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:21,417
Real power comes
from within the heart.

688
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:25,125
You would have the power
to mold the Klingon heart.

689
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,834
You could return them
to honorable ways

690
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,834
according to the original
teachings of Kahless

691
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,875
which are within you.

692
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:34,166
It would be a great challenge

693
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:37,542
if you have the
courage to accept it.

694
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:41,000
And what will we tell the people
about their new emperor?

695
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:45,417
That he appeared in a cave
or a laboratory?

696
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:48,166
We will tell them the truth.

697
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:53,291
<i>All</i> of the truth.

698
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,709
But we will tell them

699
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,041
that even if he is
not the real Kahless,

700
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:59,417
he is the rightful heir
to Kahless.

701
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,625
And if I refuse to go along
with this?

702
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:05,000
Then my brother and those
who support him on the council

703
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:07,959
will fight you,
and<i> I</i> will fight you,

704
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,667
and the empire
will fall back
into civil war.

705
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,250
What do you say
about this, Koroth?

706
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:21,625
What I say is unimportant.

707
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,834
It is acceptable.

708
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:46,250
Join with me, Gowron.

709
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:51,166
Let us usher in
this new era together.

710
00:41:54,750 --> 00:42:01,166
<i>Vorch-doh-baghk...</i>

711
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:09,667
<i>Kahless.</i>

712
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,083
Farewell, Worf.

713
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:22,625
Good-bye.

714
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:25,250
What's wrong?

715
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:28,166
You should be proud
of what you've accomplished.

716
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:38,250
I went to Boreth
to find my faith.

717
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:41,959
For a time, I thought I had,

718
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,667
but my heart is empty again.

719
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:49,750
I do not know what to believe.

720
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:53,250
You doubt the real Kahless
will return one day.

721
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:59,208
You doubt that he is still
waiting for you in<i> sto-vo-kor.</i>

722
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:08,709
Kahless left us, all of us,
a powerful legacy,

723
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,625
a way of thinking and acting
that makes us Klingon.

724
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:18,834
If his words hold wisdom
and his philosophy
is honorable,

725
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,959
what does it matter
if he returns?

726
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,583
What is important is that
we follow his teachings.

727
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:30,083
Perhaps the words

728
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:35,291
are more important
than the man.

729
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:40,959
<i>Qapla',</i> son of Mogh.

730
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,917
<i>Qapla',</i> Kahless.
