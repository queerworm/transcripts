<i>with the supply ship</i> Biko

4
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,625
<i>has been delayed</i>
<i>for another 48 hours.</i>

5
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,709
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>many members of the crew</i>

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,417
<i>are taking advantage</i>
<i>of the delay</i>

7
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,333

15
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:55,959
Yes, gentlemen?

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,542
Captain, we'd like
your permission

17
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,917
to take the
engineering computer

18
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,458
off-line for a
couple of hours.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,083
We're working on
a new interface

20
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,000
that would allow
Data to act as an
emergency backup

21
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,125
in the event
of a ship-wide
systems failure.

22
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,500
In theory,
my neural network

23
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:09,417
should be able
to sustain key systems

24
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,125
until primary control
is restored.

25
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,333
Hmm, it sounds like
an intriguing experiment.

26
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,625
I'll be interested
to see the results.

27
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:16,959
Permission granted.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,291
It's possible we might
even be able to run

29
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,333
some secondary
systems through Data--

30
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,458

sensor...

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,750
Yes, I get the idea,
Mr. La Forge.

32
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,083
Thank you.
Please proceed.

Come.

37
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,291
Jean-Luc, I need
to talk to you

38
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,458
about<i> Something</i>
<i>For Breakfast.</i>

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,166
Breakfast?

40
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,583
The play.

41
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:57,166
Ah, yes, well,
it's a very intriguing drama

42
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,458
but I really don't
have the time

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,166
it would take
to learn a part.

44
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,750
And, uh, anyway,
I'm not much of an actor.

45
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,834
That's no problem.
Oh?

46
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,458
Well, you wouldn't
be playing one
of the leads.

47
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,834
Oh.

48
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,500
It's a very small part--
only two lines.

49
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:15,583
Really?

50
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,250
It's the role
of the butler.

51
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,917
Well, I'll think about it
and let you know.

52
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,375
You would be
wonderful, Jean-Luc.

53
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,834
We're rehearsing
today at 1:30.

54
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,625
Computer, begin playback
from the first measure.

55

57
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,208
Yes!

58
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,959
Captain, I
am sorry to
interrupt...

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,667
No. Please, Mr. Worf,
come in.

60
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:51,667
I was hoping
to take advantage

61
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:52,917
of the<i> Biko's</i> delay

62
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,583
by staging ship-wide
security drills.

63
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,417
I have planned a
tentative schedule.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,166
Oh, yes, this is
very impressive, Mr. Worf.

65
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,625
But we'll be taking on
new personnel

66
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,000
at Starbase 118
in a few weeks.

67
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,333
Surely, the drills
can wait until then.

68
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,375
In that case, I will use
the time to perform

69
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:12,000
maintenance checks on
the forward phaser array.

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,709
Mr. Worf, is there
some reason

71
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,625
why you are trying to
give yourself more work?

72
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,458
No, sir. I simply wish
to use the extra time...

73
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,166
Enjoy yourself.

74
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,792
You have
the free time.

75
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:27,959
Use it.

76
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,458
Yes, sir.

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,583

What did he say?

84
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,333
The captain saw fit to
release me from my duties.

85
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,667
You mean you can go?

86
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,250
I can go.

87
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,250

You are the sheriff,

105
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,041
So...

106
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,083
we are in

107
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,166
Right.

Mm-hmm?

109

I have noticed that
you have not shaved.

I am, Data.

What do you think?

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,458
As is the case with many
natural growth processes

114
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,542
it is difficult
to envision the
end product

115

You're right.

117

a few more days.

118

I never get used
to seeing you like this.

123
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,125
I do not understand.

124
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,291
You are constantly working
on similar electronic systems

125
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,208
yet their appearances
do not disturb you.

126
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,667
Yeah, but you're not just
another electronic system.

127

Thank you, Geordi.

128
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,709
Nor are you just another

129
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,041

00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,667
(<i> laughing loudly</i> )

182
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,625
Shut up.

183
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:35,875
You laugh so much,
it's a wonder

184
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,625
you ain't got
flies in your mouth.

185
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,500
(<i> laughing</i> )

186
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,792
You're a very funny man,
Señor Eli.

187
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,208
Where are they going?

188
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,834
They don't want to get
hit by the bullets.

189
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,500
You... are under arrest.

190
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:16,834
Well...

191
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,041
Looks like Sheriff Worf's
here to arrest me.

192
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,709
That don't sound like
a bright idea...

193
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,083
...do it?

194
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,333
(<i> cocking rifle</i> )

195
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,375
You have been accused
of committing a homicide.

196
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:59,875
If you mean murder

197
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:01,208
then I guess
I'm guilty.

198
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,208
I've killed 23 men,
Sheriff.

199
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
One more ain't going to make
much of a difference.

200
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:15,041
Of course, shooting
someone as ugly as you

201
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,542
couldn't be considered
a crime, could it?

202
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,625
Was you born that way

203
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,417
or did your mama marry
an armadillo?

204
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,208
(<i> laughing loudly</i> )

205
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,458
Sheriff, look out!

206
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:43,166
I'm beginning to see
the appeal of this program.

207
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,750
Don't twitch
a whisker, Sheriff,

208
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,166
'less you want
a shave.

209
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,667
Okay, boys.

210
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,375
Saddle up!

211
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,834
But first...

212
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,750
get their
money and jewelry.

213
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:03,125
You are a
murderer<i> and</i> a thief.

214
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:08,709
A man's got to
make a living.

215
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,458
(<i> gunshot</i> )

216
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,792
(<i> drawls</i> ):
I suggest you find
a new line of work.

217
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,041
I asked Counselor Troi
to join us.

218
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,041
She loves
Western stories.

219
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,792
You'll regret this,
stranger.

220
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,458
I am now attempting to access
the long-range sensor array.

221
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,583
Forward sensor array
coming on line.

222
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,333
We're getting
a clear scan.

223
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,000
I will perform
a routine maintenance check

224
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,542
on the starboard inertial
damping system.

225
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,417
Dampers on line.

226
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,083
Maintenance check
in progress.

227
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,166
Data, I think we're
onto something here.

228
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,542
Let's see what
you can do

229
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,792
with the secondary systems.

230
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:02,500
Try gravitational
control.

231
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:03,834
Initiating gravit...

232
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,458
What's wrong?

233
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,458
There appears to be
an energy fluctuation

234
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,583
in my neural net.

235
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,917
I am disconnecting my
interface to the computer.

236
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,917
Interface deactivated.

237
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,083
You all right?

238
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,875
I have experienced
a brief power surge

239
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:31,333
in my positronic subprocessor,
but I am fine.

240
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,750
Maybe the
interface coding

241
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,417
isn't as stable
as we thought.

242
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,333
Looks like we've got

243
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,667
a couple of hours
of systems analysis

244
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,208
before we can
try this again.

245
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,083
Let's check
the interface programming.

246
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,917
What are his rights
in this century?

247
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,000
Is there a trial,
or shall I execute him?

248
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:20,125
We're supposed to
hold him till the
U.S. marshal comes.

249
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,291
And then we'll
take him to Rapid
City for a trial.

250
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,542
Frankly, I don't think

251
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,959
I'll be around here
that long.

252
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,959
Not after my old man
hears about this.

253
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:34,125
What "old man" are you
referring to?

254
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,291
My pa.

255
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,041
When he breaks me out
of this tin can

256
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,875
gravedigger will
be working overtime.

257
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,583
Your pa is no match
for Sheriff Worf.

258
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:50,125
Yes, when your "pa" comes,
we will be ready for him.

259
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:54,125
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Yeah.

260
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,333
TROI:
He's right.

261
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,583
You're no match
for the Hollanders.

262
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,333
I'm sure that the three of us
can handle any problems.

263
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,875
Hold on.

264
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,792
I was just passing through
town, saw a little trouble

265
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,667
and thought I'd lend a hand.

266
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,667
But I ain't one of
your deputies, Sheriff.

267
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,875
Counselor, I would appreciate
some support in this matter.

268
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,208
Durango!

269
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,750
I'm called Durango.

270
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,458
Yes, uh, Counselor Durango.

271
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,625
Perhaps
you would consider

272
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,083
becoming a temporary deputy.

273
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,041
For a price.

274
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,333
$500.

275
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:49,500
Alexander, we require
large amounts of currency.

276
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:50,750
Yes, sir.

277
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:52,250
I'll go to the bank
and make a withdrawal.

278
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:59,709
Deanna, how do you know
so much about this period

279
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,750
in Earth's history?

280
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,583
My father used to
read me stories

281
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,208
from the ancient West
when I was a little girl.

282
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,542
I must admit,
I always wanted
to play the part

283
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,500
of the "mysterious stranger."

284
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,875
Oh!

285
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
You are so brave.

286
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,250
Facing down
that evil man

287
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,500
like you did.

288
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:32,083
Why, thank you,
Miss...?

289
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,041
Annie, you big galoot!

290
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,959
You best not forget
that tonight

291
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,125
'cause I'm going to
make you a beefsteak

292
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,834
and some gooseberry
cobbler for dessert.

293
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,250
Sounds delicious.

294
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,709
And I bought
some special candles

295
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,041
for the table setting--
pure beeswax.

296
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,709
I will not be able
to come this evening.

297
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,750
I have a prisoner.

298
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,792
I'll keep an eye on him
for you, Sheriff.

299
00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:59,667
You two go have
a good time.

300
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:01,417
That's very
considerate of you

301
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,458
but I would be negligent
in my duties if I did not stay.

302
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
I am sorry, Ms. Annie.

303
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,709
It's another woman,
ain't it?

304
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,375
It's that
floozy down there

305
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,083
at Miss Langford's
House of Pleasure!

306
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,208
Who?

307
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,291
You sure got a way
with women, Sheriff.

308
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,250
(<i> coughs</i> )

309
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,208
Computer, activate

Play back tracks one,
two and three.

Picard Mozart Trio,

319
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,166
Okay.

320
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,375
Let's work through act two
from the beginning.

321
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,083
Whenever you're ready.

I just keep getting
more poetry.

336

Well, the PADDs
are functioning normally.

337
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:35,917
It seems to be a problem

00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,709
with the information
retrieval net.

339
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,542
Somehow, when you tried
to call up your play

340
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,041
the computer accessed
Data's literary files.

341
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,625
Geordi, perhaps
this problem

342
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,667
is related to
our interface experiment.

343
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,542
Hmm. We'd better run
a level-2 diagnostic

344
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,959
on the computer
to see if this problem

345
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,500
has spread
to any other systems.

346
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,125
And I will perform
a self-diagnostic.

347
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,250
That's a good idea.

348
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,333
You will let me know
if you find the play?

349
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,333
Oh, yeah, don't worry.

350
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,667

00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,500
You want us to kill him,
Señor Frank?

360
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,166
No.

361
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,875
He's more
valuable to us...

362
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,000
alive.

363
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,291
Feline supplement 127.

364
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:30,792
Spot, I have formulated
a new mixture of foods

365
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:33,458
specifically designed for
your highly selective tastes.

366
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,208
(<i> meowing</i> )

367
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:46,041
I find it extremely difficult

368
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,917
to predict what you
will find acceptable.

369
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:52,041
Perhaps hunger will compel you
to try it again.

370
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,208
(<i> meowing</i> )

371
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,417
Spot, you are disrupting
my ability to work.

372
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,834
(<i> meowing</i> )

373
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,333
(<i> thick Texas drawl</i> ):
Vamoose, ya little varmint!

374
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,166
(<i> plays tinkling melody</i> )

375
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,625
What'll it be?

376
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,834
I was looking
for my deputy.

377
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,792
Perhaps you have
seen him.

378
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,792
Nope.

379
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:01,208
What'll you have?

380
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,291
Um...

381
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,792
Klingon fire wine.

382
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,500
(<i> laughing</i> )

383
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,875
This ain't Kansas City.

384
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:14,750
We ain't got none of that
fancy European stuff here.

385
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,834
Maybe I should
get you a sherry.

386
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:21,208
Ain't that what
they serve at
Miss Langford's?

387
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,792
It is, ain't it?

388
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,458
Ain't it?

389
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,709
Humph.

390
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:30,083
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

391
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:34,250
(<i> dog barking</i> )

392
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,875
(<i> music stops</i> )

393
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,375
Howdy, Sheriff.

394
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,834
Commander.
What are you doing here?

395
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,458
The name is
Frank Hollander.

396
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,333
What are you
looking at?

397
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,250
Nothing.

398
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,917
Nothing at all,
Mr. Hollander.

399
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:04,625
What do you want?

400
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:06,959
My boy.

401
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,500
That is impossible.

402
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:18,375
Your son is to stand trial
for murder.

403
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:19,750
Well, then

404
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,250
we'll just have
to work something out.

405
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,500
Is there anything
you... want

406
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:28,166
in exchange
for my boy?

407
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,625
<i>You</i> have nothing I want.

408
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,417
Is that so?

409
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,625
Is that so?

410
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,583
What about your...
deputy?

411
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,333
What about him?

412
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:54,458
Where is he?

413
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,458
I do not negotiate
with criminals.

414
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,375
Your son<i> will</i> stand trial.

415
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,125
Not so fast.
(<i> yelps</i> )

416
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,041
Commander, what
are you doing?

417
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,834
I ain't in the mood
for games, Sheriff.

418
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,291
Commander?

419
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:21,041
Computer, freeze program.

420
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:31,208
I wouldn't walk out that door
if I was you, Sheriff.

421
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:52,959
(<i> door opening</i> )

422
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,083
What's wrong?

423
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,792
The holodeck safeguards
are not functioning.

424
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,250
Alexander's in trouble.

425
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,917
My God!
You've been shot.

426
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:10,417
Computer, end program.

427
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:15,041
Troi to Captain Picard.

428
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:17,959
Troi to security.

429
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,875
There's another
character in
the program--

430
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,458
Hollander's father.

431
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,291
And he looks like
Commander Data.

432
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,458
Data?!

433
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,750
But it is not
Data.

434
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,750
I-I cannot explain.

435
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,208
I believe he has
taken Alexander.

436
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:38,458
ELI:
Aw, now, isn't
that a shame?

437
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:42,792
Poor Sheriff's
been injured.

438
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:44,542
What's the matter?

439
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:47,125
Was my pa
a little too rough on ya?

440
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,875
(<i> laughing</i> )

441
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:56,542
Data?

442
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,083
What?

443
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,166
Why is the computer
creating characters

444
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,625
that look like Data?

445
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,208
Where have they
taken my son?

446
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,417
Where is he?

447
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:15,625
Temper, temper, Sheriff.

448
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:19,041
My pa ain't going to
like it if I come
home all bruised.

449
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,166
Worf, wait!

450
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:31,750
We have to remember--
even though

451
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:33,709
the holodeck
safeguards
may be off

452
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,750
this is still
a program.

453
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:37,834
If we can just
get to the end
of this story

454
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,959
the way it
was designed
to play out

455
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,125
the program will
automatically
terminate.

456
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,208
You are right.

457
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,333
I will begin by speaking
to the people of this town.

458
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,333
Perhaps somebody witnessed
Alexander's abduction.

459
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,083
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

460
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,542
<i>Commander La Forge and Mr. Data</i>
<i>believe they have found</i>

461
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:09,208
<i>the cause</i>
<i>of the mysterious malfunctions</i>

462
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,083
<i>which have been plaguing</i>
<i>the ship.</i>

463
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:14,917
We think our interface
experiment may have caused

464
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,792
one of the computer's
core subroutines
to be altered.

465
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:19,208
When the interface
malfunction occurred

466
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,166
subroutine C-47
was replaced

467
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:23,542
by elements
from my personal programming.

468
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,542
What does C-47 control?

469
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:28,125
Library computer access,
replicator selection

470
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,792
recreational programming.
No critical systems.

471
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:33,000
That would explain why
your music composition program

472
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,291
began playing
"The Slavonic Dances."

473
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,417
I have been analyzing

474
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,500
the collected works
of Anton Dvorak.

475
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:40,542
It's the same with
Dr. Crusher's play

476
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,166
and with the food
replicators.

477
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,542
The replicators
on decks four through nine

478
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,125
are producing nothing
but cat food.

479
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,875
Cat food?

480
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:49,083
I have been formulating

481
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,166
nutritional supplements
for Spot.

482
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:53,792
Oh... when can you
correct the problem?

483
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:55,333
We are currently attempting
to isolate

484
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,667
the corrupted
circuit pathways.

485
00:30:57,709 --> 00:30:59,208
I reckon the process
should take

486
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,750
less than two hours.

487
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,333
What did you say?

488
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:05,291
I said the process should
take less than two hours.

489
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,250
No. You said,
"I reckon."

490
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,500
According to my memory logs,
I did not use those words.

491
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:14,709
(<i> drawls</i> ):
Y'all must be mistaken.

492
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,000
There, Data,
you did it again.

493
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,792
(<i> drawls</i> ):
Did what?

494
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:21,208
Uh... Mr. La Forge

495
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,458
perhaps you should take
Mr. Data to engineering.

496
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,875
See if you can
find the problem.

497
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,000
Aye, sir.

498
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,667
(<i> sighing</i> )

499
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:52,333
(<i> cards shuffling</i> )

500
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,875
(<i> tapping</i> )

501
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,500
Can I help you
with something?

502
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:20,917
(<i> knocking</i> )

503
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,291
I spoke
to several witnesses

504
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:29,792
who saw Alexander
being abducted

505
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:33,208
as he was leaving the bank
by one of Hollander's men.

506
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,959
We must begin a systematic
search of the town.

507
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,375
Worf, we've got
another problem.

508
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:39,917
I saw Eli playing cards.

509
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,875
He was shuffling
the way Data does
when he plays poker.

510
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,917
He doesn't just
<i>look</i> like Data.

511
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,375
He has Data's abilities

512
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:50,125
which means his father
probably does also.

513
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,709
(<i> knocking</i> )

514
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:12,458
I come to see my boy.

515
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,083
Remove your weapon.

516
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,333
Better take a good look
at that gun, Sheriff.

517
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,834
You might be
seeing it again real soon.

518
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,250
Pa!

519
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:29,375
Eli!

520
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:36,458
How they
treating you, boy?

521
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,917
Real bad, Pa.

522
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,375
Ain't fed me
since I got here

523
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,542
and that sheriff's been

524
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:43,291
roughing up on me
something fierce.

525
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,375
Don't you worry, boy.

526
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:46,875
Sheriff's
going to pay.

527
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,625
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Who's the stranger?

528
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:51,750
I don't know.

529
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:53,417
She ain't
said her name

530
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,208
but she's in cahoots
with the sheriff

531
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,500
and she's mighty mean
with that Winchester.

532
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:00,834
You sit tight, boy.

533
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:03,000
I'll have you home
in time for supper.

534
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:11,375
I'm going to give you
one more opportunity, Sheriff,

535
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,959
to avoid a ugly situation.

536
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:16,709
Release my boy.

537
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,750
I have reconsidered
your offer.

538
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:25,542
I will release your son
in exchange for my deputy.

539
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:29,000
I thought you might have
a change of heart.

540
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,083
Meet me in two hours.

541
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,208
You be in front of
the saloon.

542
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,000
I'll be in front
of the livery stable.

543
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,291
Strangers ain't invited.

544
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,667
Agreed.

545
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,250
In every Western
I've ever read,

546
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,166
the villains always
break their word.

547
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,583
He can't be trusted.

548
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,208
But we have made
an honorable agreement.

549
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:13,750
They're not concerned
with honor, Worf.

550
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,875
This is
the ancient West.

551
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,667
There's a gunfighter
out there

552
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:20,375
who has the speed and
accuracy of an android...

553
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,750
... and in two hours, he's
going to try to kill you.

554
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,000
Mr. Data.

555
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,417
Howdy, Commander.

556
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,750
Geordi, what
have you found?

557
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:52,417
(<i> drawl</i> ):
Well, we figure part
of my memory structure

558
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:53,959
(<i> in normal voice</i> ):
was replaced with information

559
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,709
from the computer's
recreational database.

560
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,083
Specifically,
the files relating

561
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:00,333
to the American
19th-century West.

562
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,166
That would explain
the accent.

563
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,250
You got it, pardner.

564
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:06,792
This is a result of the
experimental interface?

565
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:08,375
I'm afraid so,
but we've initiated

566
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,625
a progressive memory purge
to restore Data's programming

567
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,291
to its original state.

568
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,500
He should be back to normal
in a couple of hours.

569
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:16,959
And what about the computer's
recreational database?

570
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,583
We've started a memory purge
there, as well.

571
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,166
That should take
another hour, maybe two.

572
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:27,417
Commander...
you just sit tight.

573
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:30,333
We'll have this all fixed up
in time for supper.

574
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:31,458
Good.

575
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:37,083
WORF:
I will be positioned here

576
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,583
at the eastern end
of the street.

577
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:41,041
Frank Hollander says
he will approach
from this end.

578
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:44,208
Now, when he reaches this point,
he will be within range.

579
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,166
Understood.
What about Alexander?

580
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,417
Well, there's a rain barrel
in front of the saloon.

581
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,834
It should be enough
to stop the bullets.

582
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,208
(<i> knocking</i> )

583
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,750
You would not believe
what I went through

584
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:04,875
to get Old Man Newsome

585
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:06,542
to give up
his telegraph machine.

586
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,959
Ah...

587
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,291
Excellent.

588
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:19,750
Lord knows why I keep risking
my life for you, Sheriff.

589
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,166
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

590
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,417
Oh, yes, uh,
thank you, Ms. Annie.

591
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:31,792
I'm in your debt.

592
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,583
(<i> clock chimes</i> )

593
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,709
I have connected
the communicator's energy cell

594
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,625
to serve as the
power source.

595
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,583
How long
will the field last?

596
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,458
No more than
15 seconds.

597
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,208
It is highly unstable.

598
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,542
Let's hope it's enough.

599
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,583
(<i> bird cawing</i> )

600
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,166
(<i> dog barking</i> )

601
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:24,417
(<i> spurs jangling</i> )

602
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:45,041
(<i> dog barking</i> )

603
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,083
Eli, get down!

604
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,333
Alexander!

605
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:15,792
Don't even think
about it.

606
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:16,959
Señor Frank!

607
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:48,458
Go ahead, shoot me.

608
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,333
Do not show your face
in this town again.

609
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:05,959
Let's go.

610
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,208
(<i> birds cawing</i> )

611
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,792
Father!

612
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:28,667
Are you all right?

613
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:29,792
Yes.

614
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,750
End program.

615
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,000
I don't understand this.

616
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:39,834
The story
should be over.

617
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,417
What's left?

618
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,083
Computer, end program.

619
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,458
Sheriff!

620
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,458
You're as handy
with a shootin' iron...

621
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:01,458
... as you are with a woman's
heart.

622
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:04,625
Computer, end program.

623
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:11,458
Computer!

624
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,625
<i>Now!</i>

625
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:30,458
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46278.3.</i>

626
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,542
<i>Both Commander Data</i>
<i>and the ship's computer</i>

627
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,959
<i>have been restored</i>
<i>to normal operation.</i>

628
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,125
<i>Our rendezvous</i>
<i>with the supply ship</i> Biko

629

630
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:53,750
Father...

631
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,417
after what happened

632
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,542
I guess
you'll never want

633
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,208
to go back to
the<i> ancient West.</i>

634
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:12,375
The town of Deadwood may
face danger once again.

635
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,959
If they do, they will
need a sheriff...

636
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:21,709
and a deputy.
