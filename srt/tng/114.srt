00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:07,250
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41636.9:</i>

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,041
<i>As feared, our examination</i>

3
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,792
<i>of the seven-year-overdue</i>
<i>Federation freighter,</i> Odin

4
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:14,458
<i>disabled by an asteroid</i>
<i>collision</i>

5
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,208
<i>revealed no life signs.</i>

6
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,667
<i>However, three escape pods</i>
<i>were missing</i>

7
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:22,083
<i>suggesting the possibility</i>
<i>of survivors.</i>

8
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,542
Ready to begin orbit
of Angel One, Captain.

9
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:25,750
Make it so, Mr. La Forge.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,709
What kind
of place is this, Data?

11
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:29,709
Angel One is a
class-M planet, sir

12
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,750
supporting carbon-based
flora and fauna.

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,458
Sparsely populated
with intelligent
life-forms.

14
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,542
It is similar
in technological
development

15
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:38,291
to mid-twentieth
century Earth.

16
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,542
Kind of like being
marooned at home.

17
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:44,166
Assuming any of the survivors
made it this far.

18
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,208
Admittedly, it is
the closest planet to the<i> Odin.</i>

19
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,125
To travel the distance we did
in two days at warp one

20
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,458
would have taken
the<i> Odin</i> escape
pod five months.

21
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,834
Five months, six days,
11 hours, two minutes...

22
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,083
Thank you, Data.

23
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,875
And 57 seconds.

24
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,792
Captain, we're receiving
an audio signal from Angel One.

25
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:03,500
Starfleet are adamant
that we maintain

26
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,625
excellent diplomatic relations
with this planet.

27
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,583
Mr. Data

28
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,250
is there
any other

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,625
pertinent information
before we reply?

30
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:11,834
Angel One has evolved

31
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,667
into a constitutional
oligarchy.

32
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,875
It is governed
by a parliamentary body

33
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,000
consisting of six
elected mistresses

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,375
and headed by a female
they refer to as

35
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,834
"The Elected One."

36
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:24,458
It sounds like my own planet.

37
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,291
Klingons appreciate
strong women.

38
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:31,667
How current is this
information, Mr. Data?

39
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:34,625
A Federation vessel
last visited this planet

40
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,250
62 years ago,
Captain.

41
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,125
Counselor, as this is
a female-dominated society

42
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,375
you might wish to make
the initial contact.

43
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,041
Thank you,
sir.

44
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,458
Open hailing
frequencies.

45
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,750
Hailing frequencies
open, sir.

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,375
This is Counselor Deanna Troi
from the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

47
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:55,291
I am Beata, The Elected One.

48
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,291
How may we assist you,
Counselor?

49
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,959
The Federation has neglected
to visit your planet

50
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,375
for far too long.

51
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,625
With your permission

52
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,709
we would like to correct
that oversight.

53
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,625
We feel in no way neglected,
Counselor.

54
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,375
A diplomatic courtesy call

55
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,458
is neither expected
nor required.

56
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:19,000
We also come in search
of possible survivors

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,333
from one of our freighters.

58
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:26,083
A brief visit will be tolerated.

59
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,959
TASHA:
They've broken off

60
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,917
transmission.

61
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,917
Ever feel like you're
not really wanted?

62
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:01,750
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

63
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,125
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

64
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,041
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

65
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:11,667
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

66
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:16,208
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

67
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:21,166
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

68
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,250
Where are you
fellas off to?

69
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,792
Our ski instructor
has us scheduled

70
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,208
for the Denubian Alps, sir.

71
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,458
Well, save us
some deep powder.

72
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,625
No problem, sir.

73
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,667
The holodecks have all
you'd ever need.

74
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,542
The away team
is ready, sir.

75
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,208
Angel One's
strategic importance

76
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,250
in this quadrant
may become vital.

77
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,834
Starfleet's hope
is that one day

78
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,375
this world may become
part of the Federation.

79
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,458
We'll do our best

80
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,375
to make a good
impression, Captain.

81
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,625
Energize.

82
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,458
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

83
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,750
<i>Our away team</i>
<i>has beamed down</i>

84
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,125
<i>to an unusual</i>
<i>matriarchal society</i>

85
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,709
<i>where the female is as</i>
<i>aggressively dominant</i>

86
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:21,834
<i>as the male gender was on Earth</i>
<i>hundreds of years ago.</i>

87
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:25,542
<i>Here, the female is the hunter,</i>
<i>the soldier</i>

88
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,834
<i>larger and stronger</i>
<i>than the male...</i>

89
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:32,000
<i>an arrangement considered</i>
<i>most sensible and natural.</i>

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,250
I am Beata

91
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,917
The Elected One
of Angel One.

92
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,291
Representatives
of the Starfleet<i> Enterprise</i>

93
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,834
do you wish to petition?

94
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,125
We do.

95
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,083
We have reason

96
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,375
to hope that
survivors

97
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,041
from a damaged
Federation freighter

98
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,125
may be marooned
on your planet.

99
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,458
We are seeking
to learn

100
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,417
if this
is so.

101
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,834
Even a world as remote
as Angel One

102
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:54,625
has heard of Starfleet.

103
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,291
Searching the galaxy
for survivors

104
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,375
seems a petty task

105
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,709
for one of their
mighty vessels.

106
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:04,709
We don't consider
even one survivor petty.

107
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:09,792
Is this man implying that
we put a lesser value on life

108
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,458
than you do?

109
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,917
Not at all.

110
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:17,291
Our discovery
of the freighter
was unexpected.

111
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,417
We have a duty
to investigate.

112
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,792
I see.

113
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:26,000
And if you find any survivors

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,375
what then?

115
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,083
We would take
them with us

116
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,375
and see that they
were reunited

117
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,375
with their families.

118
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,083
Are we to take
these strangers

119
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,625
at their word?

120
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,083
Good question.

121
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,750
What reason could
we possibly have

122
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,000
to deceive you?

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,166
Another good
question.

124
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,709
Are there survivors

125
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:45,542
from the freighter
<i>Odin</i> on your planet?

126
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,834
I'm not prepared
to answer--

127
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:50,959
yet.

128
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,500
See to their
comforts.

129
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,959
(<i> whispers</i> ):
What's going on?

130
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,709
You will remain
here until summoned.

131
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,250
Is this area secure?
Can we talk?

132
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,959
Yes, tricorder doesn't show
any listening devices

133
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,333
or anything else of
a threatening nature.

134
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,166
Good. Troi?

135
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,834
There was much fear
in that room.

136
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,959
Paranoia, I'd say.
But of what?

137
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,458
I cannot say.

138
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,667
But their fear was not focused.

139
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,083
I sensed they were all

140
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,709
not concerned
for the same reason.

141
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:51,083
Undoubtedly, there are survivors
from the<i> Odin</i> on this planet.

142
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,542
I agree.

143
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:55,250
Otherwise, why would they
be so circumspect?

144
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,959
As Mistress Beata
is so fond of saying--

145
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,625
good question.

146
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,083
What do we do if they deny
the existence of survivors?

147
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,250
Let's not look for problems.

148
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:13,333
I want all departments to
prepare for a warp six trip

149
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,667
into the neutral zone

150
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,792
as soon as the away team
completes its mission.

151
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:18,166
Trouble, Captain?

152
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,709
Insurance.

153
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,375
Romulan battle cruisers
have been detected

154
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,959
near one of our
border posts.

155
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,375
They've requested
our assistance as soon as...

156
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,834
Ah! Ah!

157
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,959
Report, Mr. Crusher.

158
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,000
We finished
our ski lesson, sir

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,208
and it kind
of just happened.

160
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,542
On the<i> Enterprise,</i>
Mr. Crusher

161
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:45,875
nothing
"just happens."

162
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,500
What is that smell?

163
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,625
WORF:
Hmm, yes.

164
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,834
Slightly reminiscent

165
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,834
of Night-Blooming
<i>throgni,</i> Captain.

166
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:55,625
From home.

167
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,041
Quite stimulating,
wouldn't you say?

168
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,542
No.

169
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,625
I don't smell
anything.

170
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,917
I'm a little
congested with snow.

171
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:06,417
Don't let this
"just happen" again

172
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:07,583
Mr. Crusher.

173
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,041
Yes, sir.

174
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,000
Hmm!

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,834
Interesting.

176
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,875
An alcohol-based
synthetic

177
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,417
artificially reproducing
a floral scent.

178
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,458
It's called
perfume, Data.

179
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,166
The purpose of which is...

180
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,375
Certain cultures consider
perfume an aphrodisiac.

181
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,875
I am unfamiliar
with that term.

182
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,917
An aphrodisiac
is something used

183
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:43,792
to stimulate or enhance
sexual pleasure.

184
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,959
How does stimulation
of the olfactory nerves

185
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,291
affect the enjoyment
of sex?

186
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,375
The Elected One
will see you now.

187
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,083
You claim you intend

188
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,166
to remove these survivors
from our world.

189
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,041
Are you prepared to give
your solemn word on that?

190
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,750
We are.

191
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,500
You should know that
the vote was not unanimous.

192
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,000
Some of those among us
are suspicious.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,041
Yet, the majority feel

194
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,959
we have no choice
but to trust you.

195
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,875
We don't understand the source
of your misgivings, Mistress

196
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,709
but we appreciate
your faith in us.

197
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:31,792
Make certain that faith
is not misplaced.

198
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,458
There are four
survivors

199
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,959
from the ship you call<i> Odin.</i>

200
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,792
All male.

201
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:43,333
Their leader is a man
who calls himself Ramsey.

202
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,000
If you'll deliver
these men to us

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,583
we'll have them off
your planet immediately.

204
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,166
If they were mine to deliver

205
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,166
I would do it
without hesitation.

206
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,333
Unfortunately,
their hiding place

207
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,458
has long eluded us.

208
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,583
Hiding place?

209
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,500
Why are they
in hiding?

210
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,000
Because they're fugitives
on Angel One.

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,542
And the quicker we get
rid of them, the better.

212
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,792
When these men came to us
seven years ago

213
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:10,291
they accepted our hospitality
quickly enough

214
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,291
but they gradually became
restive.

215
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:17,125
Started making unreasonable
demands.

216
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,917
Went against the natural order.

217
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:22,625
Using the technology
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

218
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,041
we might be able
to find these men.

219
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,208
I assumed as much.

220
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,500
But be warned, Counselor.

221
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,291
These men are dangerous.

222
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,250
(<i> coughing</i> )

223
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,208
CRUSHER:
Sick Bay to Captain Picard.

224
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,250
Picard here.

225
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,750
Wesley and one of his friends

226
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,291
have contracted some form
of respiratory ailment.

227
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,375
A respiratory ailment?
Is it contained?

228
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,625
I hope so.
I've isolated the 12 students

229
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,834
who were on the Quazulu VIII
field trip.

230
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,792
How contagious is it?

231
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:05,583
Still running tests.

232
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:09,291
The key is to figure how
the virus is transmitted.

233
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,083
So far, I've been able
to rule out

234
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,667
person to person contact.

235
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,083
Well, keep with it, Doctor.

236
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,083
Starfleet has very important
business for us

237
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,041
as soon as
the away team returns.

238
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,458
I don't fancy the idea
of my crew being infected.

239
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,875
Data, what's the best way

240
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,500
to go about finding Ramsey
and the other survivors?

241
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,834
If we can isolate
something unique

242
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:39,333
to the<i> Odin</i>
survivors

243
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,250
perhaps an element
not otherwise found

244
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,041
on Angel One,
we can utilize

245
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,166
the<i> Enterprise</i>
scanners.

246
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,417
Mr. Data will need
access to your library.

247
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:52,542
Our library is far
too sophisticated

248
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:53,750
for a man
to comprehend.

249
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,417
I am an android,
Mistress

250
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:58,625
though anatomically,
I am a male.

251
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,667
An amusing notion.

252
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:05,458
Maybe you could
teach our males
a thing or two.

253
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,625
Trent, see to
the android's needs.

254
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,834
Bridge to
Captain Picard.

255
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,291
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

256
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,917
The away team
requests

257
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,250
that we scan the
planet's surface

258
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,375
for traces
of platinum.

259
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,750
Have Mr. La Forge
break fixed orbit

260
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,875
and initiate a search pattern.

261
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,792
Aye, Captain.

262
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,083
Geordi.

263
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,208
Search pattern
initiated... now.

264
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,458
This was delivered
for you.

265
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,750
Good.

266
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,875
It's for my meeting
with Beata.

267
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,750
You're not going
to wear that.

268
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,834
Of course.

269
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,667
Part of this mission
is diplomatic.

270
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,709
I have requested an audience
with a head of state

271
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:03,709
and I will honor her by
wearing indigenous apparel.

272
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,875
I don't believe this.

273
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,166
You're going to put
that thing on

274
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,458
and parade around
like one of them?

275
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,125
Why, what is this attitude?

276
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,625
On Kabatris, I had to wear furs

277
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,333
to meet with
the leadership council

278
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,500
and on Armus IX
I wore feathers.

279
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,000
This objection doesn't
have anything to do

280
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,417
with the fact that Beata
is a woman

281
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:25,834
and an attractive one,
does it?

282
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,750
This is quite
unnecessary, Doctor.

283
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,959
I'm fine!

284
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,208
You're infected
with the virus, Captain.

285
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,792
In my opinion,
you are no longer
physically able

286
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,125
to effectively
command this vessel.

287
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,875
That is ridiculous,
Doctor!

288
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,375
I've an away team down there
in less than friendly territory

289
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,583
and, in addition,
I have an appointment

290
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:54,125
with several
Romulan battle cruisers...

291
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,125
You have
an appointment

292
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,375
in your cabin,
Captain

293
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,917
with your bed.

294
00:14:57,917 --> 00:14:59,375
Is that an order, Doctor?

295
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,709
Yes.

296
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,875
I think I may sneeze.

297
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,542
A Klingon sneeze?

298
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:08,333
Only kind I know.

299
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,417
Lieutenant
La Forge

300
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:14,291
you have command
until further notice.

301
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,458
Please make the proper
ship's log entries.

302
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,959
Aye, sir.

303
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,500
Scanners indicate
a platinum trace.

304
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,291
Should I notify
the away team?

305
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,041
Make it so.

306
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,166
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Tasha.

307
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,208
What do you think?

308
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,375
(<i> laughs</i> )

309
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,792
Uh...

310
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,834
Well...

311
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,834
I got to say,
it's kind of sexy.

312
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,834
Thank you,
Lieutenant.

313
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:17,166
Actually, it feels
quite comfortable.

314
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,250
(<i> giggles</i> )

315
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,000
How handsome you look.

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,875
Thank you.

317
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,291
The<i> Enterprise</i> reports

318
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,250
a possible location
for Mr. Ramsey

319
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,500
and the other
survivors.

320
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,458
So soon?
I'm impressed.

321
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,083
I am suspicious.

322
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,083
You don't believe me?

323
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,375
Not yet.

324
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,333
I hear the words,
but not the sincerity.

325
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,542
You had your opportunity
to object, Ariel.

326
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,041
You were
in the minority.

327
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,333
ARIEL:
After seven years,
the great ship<i> Enterprise</i>

328
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,041
comes to repatriate
a small group

329
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,625
of insignificant people.

330
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,500
Mistress Ariel,
I hear the words

331
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,083
but not the sincerity.

332
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,583
You should listen
more carefully.

333
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,709
Excuse me, Mistress.

334
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:02,959
I have matters
to attend to elsewhere.

335
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,458
With your permission
we'd like to

336
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,041
begin our search
immediately.

337
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,917
By all means.

338
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:16,166
But I'm sure
Counselor Troi
and the others

339
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,333
can see to that
without you.

340
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,792
If I recall, you had
a gesture of goodwill
you wish to give to me.

341
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,041
Certainly
that can wait

342
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,375
until we've recovered
the survivors.

343
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,750
Are you suggesting that
the women in your party

344
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,834
are incapable
of accomplishing that task

345
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:30,875
without the help
of a man?

346
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,208
Not at all.

347
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,959
Lieutenant Yar
and Counselor Troi

348
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:37,375
are completely
qualified.

349
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,417
You're very generous
with your praise.

350
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:44,166
Inform them that you
will remain here with me.

351
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,041
Riker to Lieutenant Yar.

352
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,166
This is Yar.

353
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,375
In the interest
of diplomatic relations

354
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,625
I'll remain here
with Mistress Beata

355
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,375
while you conduct our search.

356
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,083
Commander?

357
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,125
You have your instructions.

358
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:08,291
Relax, we have
much to discuss.

359
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,375
Set phasers to stun.

360
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,291
I wish they
weren't necessary.

361
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,667
A justified precaution,
Counselor.

362
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:19,959
Mistress Beata observed

363
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:22,542
that Mr. Ramsey
and his men are dangerous.

364
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,583
Lieutenant Yar to<i> Enterprise.</i>

365
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,417
LA FORGE:
Go ahead, Tasha.

366
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:28,709
Three to beam to the location
of that platinum trace, Geordi.

367
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,542
Coordinates set.

368
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,083
Energize.

369
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,375
Tasha!

370
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,709
Welcome.

371
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:56,041
I've been expecting you.

372
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,250
Picard to Bridge.

373
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,709
(<i> Klingon sneeze</i> )

374
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,208
La Forge here.

375
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,125
Status report.

376
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,125
82 more reported cases
of the virus, sir.

377
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,625
Dr. Crusher has converted
the holodeck

378
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,125
into an isolation ward.

379
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,917
And the... the away team?

380
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,208
Well, no recent
contact, sir.

381
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,750
But I have informed them
of the medical situation up here

382
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,000
and of the growing
Romulan threat to our
neutral zone outpost.

383
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,542
Keep me advised.

384
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:43,291
You have the Bridge
until Commander Riker returns.

385
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,291
Engineering reports
a computer mal...

386
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,083
(<i> Klingon sneeze</i> )

387
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:54,208
I'm sorry.

388
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,959
I'm getting sick.

389
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,709
I'm sure half the ship
knows that by now.

390
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:00,875
Report to Sick Bay,
Lieutenant.

391
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,625
Engineering to Bridge.

392
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,041
(<i> sighs</i> )
La Forge here.

393
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,542
The computer won't accept
the varying climate controls.

394
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,709
On my way.

395
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,542
With all respect,
Lieutenant

396
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:14,375
there are people
to do that job now.

397
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,250
La Forge to Engineering.

398
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,959
Lieutenant Wong
knows that system.

399
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:23,208
I'm sure she'll be able
to resolve all problems.

400
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,542
Worf...

401
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,583
thanks for the advice.

402
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,083
(<i> Klingon sneeze</i> )

403
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,041
RAMSEY:
How did you find me?

404
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,083
DATA:
Actually, it was quite simple.

405
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,417
Angel One
has no platinum.

406
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:46,750
<i>Enterprise</i> scanners
did the rest.

407
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,000
Platinum, was it?

408
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,125
My wings.

409
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,291
I kept them for
their sentimental value.

410
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,166
Where are the other survivors,
Mr. Ramsey?

411
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,625
Oh, they're nearby.

412
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,166
They're packing,
as a matter of fact

413
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,125
since we can no longer
remain here.

414
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,417
Seven years on an alien planet

415
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:08,834
and I sense no anticipation,
no excitement at being rescued?

416
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,417
What is it that you think
that you're rescuing me from?

417
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,709
My shipmates and I
have all taken wives.

418
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,458
A few even
have children.

419
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,458
You can't rescue a man from a
place that he calls his home.

420
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,083
Why were you so hesitant
at first

421
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,208
to tell us
about the<i> Odin</i> survivors?

422
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,458
Because Ramsey and his
men are anarchists.

423
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,208
I had to make sure
you weren't here

424
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,917
to fuel their struggle.

425
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,208
I like the way
your eyes pick up

426
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,709
the color
of your tunic.

427
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:46,458
It's not our position
to interfere

428
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,667
in the domestic affairs
of other societies.

429
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,208
But you can
interact?

430
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,625
Of course.

431
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,500
Otherwise,
how can we learn?

432
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,750
Is that why you're
here with me tonight?

433
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,625
To learn?

434
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,041
Yes.

435
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,625
About our society?

436
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,959
Yes.

437
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,250
Well, in our society

438
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,041
it is the men who are
the fortunate ones

439
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:13,166
enjoying all
life has to offer

440
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,166
while we women
devote ourselves

441
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,291
to the obligation
of making life work.

442
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:23,500
In our society we share
the responsibilities

443
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,166
and the pleasures
equally.

444
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,333
Which is why I'm able
to be here with you

445
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,166
while the women of the away team
go to find Ramsey.

446
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,917
You have to remind
me to thank them
when they come back

447
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:35,083
for giving us
this time.

448
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:44,875
You resist.

449
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:48,542
Don't you find
me attractive?

450
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:52,750
Yes, I find you
very attractive.

451
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,125
You attract me
like no man ever has.

452
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:00,834
It's not my function
to seduce or be seduced

453
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:03,417
by the leader
of another world.

454
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:04,834
That's not
the reason.

455
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:06,208
No, it's not.

456
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,208
But will you still
respect me in the morning?

457
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,583
I hope so.

458
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,375
Thank you, Trent.

459
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:28,291
You may go.

460
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,667
Compliments
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

461
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:47,208
It's called an Albeni
meditation crystal.

462
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:55,166
Very impressive.

463
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:58,583
And now, I must
repay you in kind.

464
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:10,250
Five months in a rescue pod
no bigger than this room

465
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:15,917
is an eternity I hope none
of you will ever have to face.

466
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:19,792
When we finally
made it here

467
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,291
we thought we'd died
and gone to heaven.

468
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,458
You've seen the women
on this planet.

469
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:28,000
They're tall and strong
and very lovely.

470
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,625
But after the newness wore off

471
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:34,125
we started to see
how the men were treated.

472
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:38,083
There's no votes,
there's no opinions

473
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,625
there's no respect.

474
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,291
None of which
is your concern

475
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,500
any longer, Mr. Ramsey.

476
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,500
Call the others in,
please.

477
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,333
It's time
to leave.

478
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,000
Despite their
problems, Lieutenant

479
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,125
we happen to like it
here on Angel One.

480
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,917
We're not
going anywhere.

481
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:57,834
But Mistress Beata...

482
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,417
Mistress Beata be damned!

483
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:02,458
Her wish is not my command,
and neither is yours.

484
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,834
You can't force us to go.

485
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,500
DATA:
Mr. Ramsey
is correct, Counselor.

486
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,333
The<i> Odin</i> was not a starship,
which means her crew

487
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,208
is not bound
by the prime directive.

488
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,750
If he and the others
wish to stay here

489
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,750
there is absolutely
nothing we can do about it.

490
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:30,208
(<i> coughing</i> )

491
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:32,125
LA FORGE:
Bridge to Sick Bay.

492
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:34,250
How are you doing, Doctor?

493
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,834
We have more sick
than we do beds.

494
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:40,583
So far, I've been forced
to confine over 300

495
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,333
to their private quarters.

496
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,375
We're going to be
seriously undermanned

497
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,667
if we're forced to engage
the Romulans in battle.

498
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:49,417
The Romulans are your problem,
Lieutenant--

499
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:52,750
trying to find an inoculant
is mine.

500
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,083
This virus mutates
every 20 minutes.

501
00:25:56,083 --> 00:26:00,500
But we haven't
had any fatalities... yet.

502
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,083
If this continues, there will be
no one left to run the ship.

503
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,083
If this continues,
Lieutenant La Forge

504
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:09,375
nobody will be healthy enough
to care.

505
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,000
Yar to<i> Enterprise.</i>

506
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,208
<i>Enterprise</i> here, go ahead.

507
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:18,041
Prepare to beam three to our
previous location, Geordi.

508
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,583
After regrouping
with Commander Riker

509
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,125
we'll return
to the ship.

510
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,542
I suggest you make that
on the double, Tasha.

511
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:26,166
We have a real medical emergency
brewing up here.

512
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,125
One-third of the crew is down

513
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,917
and the latest information
from the neutral zone outpost

514
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,458
is that more Romulan vessels are
converging on that area.

515
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,125
YAR:
I'll inform
the Commander.

516
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,125
Yar out.

517
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:39,333
One thing before we go.

518
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:42,583
You said you were
expecting us.

519
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,375
Why?

520
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:47,917
I can't answer that.

521
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:51,959
We wish you well,
Mr. Ramsey.

522
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,709
Energize.

523
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:05,875
They're gone.

524
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,959
BEATA:
What a refreshing
change--

525
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,959
to be with a man
who knows what he wants.

526
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:26,417
RIKER:
And doesn't have
to be told by a woman?

527
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:28,750
Exactly.

528
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,125
I knew you were bright
enough to understand.

529
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,667
See, women, by our very nature

530
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,083
want only what is best
for their men.

531
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:41,875
Men are not objects
to be possessed, Mistress Beata.

532
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:44,458
Of course
they're not.

533
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,041
It was merely
a figure of speech.

534
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:52,166
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

535
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,625
Enter.

536
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,750
What is so important
you find it necessary

537
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,375
to intrude upon my privacy?

538
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,375
They have returned, Mistress

539
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,417
but without Ramsey
or the others.

540
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:18,125
Your advanced technology
has proven inadequate?

541
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,125
What happened, Tasha?

542
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:23,583
Mr. Ramsey and the other
survivors refuse to leave.

543
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:26,792
You gave me
your solemn word.

544
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,333
I'm sorry, there's
nothing else we can do.

545
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,959
I'm sorry as well.

546
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:45,458
Since you refuse
to take them with you

547
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,583
I am left with no choice

548
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:50,709
but to sentence them all
to death.

549
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:01,583
Come.

550
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,250
It looks horrible

551
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,083
tastes worse

552
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,208
but it's absolutely
guaranteed

553
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,166
to make you
feel better.

554
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:37,542
I knew you'd like it.

555
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,500
Are you wearing cologne?

556
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,834
Like something
I smelled earlier

557
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:45,500
something Klingon.

558
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,000
Lieutenant Worf and I

559
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,500
detected the same scent

560
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,542
when we bumped

561
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:52,542
into your son

562
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,667
at the holodeck.

563
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,458
It's that smell.

564
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:01,458
That's how
the virus travels.

565
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,792
An airborne particle

566
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:04,583
whose sweet scent

567
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:08,000
inspires deep inhalation.

568
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,625
And once inside the body

569
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,625
becomes that damn virus!

570
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,792
I have work to do.

571
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:19,166
You're excused, Doctor.

572
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,917
What's the latest
on the<i> Enterprise's</i>
medical situation?

573
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,709
Dr. Crusher
feels the virus

574
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:29,208
will undoubtedly
run unchecked

575
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,375
through
the entire ship.

576
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,834
Attempts to develop
an inoculant

577
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:33,709
have so far ended
in failure.

578
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:36,000
Lieutenant La Forge
still has Bridge command

579
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,875
pending your return, sir.

580
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:40,959
And what about the Romulans
entering the neutral zone?

581
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:43,625
The border outpost
reports a contingent

582
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,375
of seven Romulan
battle cruisers

583
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,750
within sensor range.

584
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,083
The USS<i> Berlin</i> has answered
the distress call.

585
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:51,291
However, should
hostilities erupt

586
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,333
both the outpost
and the starship

587
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,875
will be outgunned.

588
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:57,583
It is felt that the
<i>Enterprise's</i> presence

589
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:00,083
in the area will be
a vital show of force.

590
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,667
Some show
of force.

591
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:04,333
The<i> Enterprise</i>
could fly on autopilot

592
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,083
but with that virus
knocking down our crew

593
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,458
we're going to be
in sorry shape

594
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:09,583
if things turn ugly.

595
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,333
I think it's time
we leave this place.

596
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,834
It doesn't feel right to leave

597
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:17,542
while Beata is determined
to execute those people.

598
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,417
She has to find
them first.

599
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,792
Ramsey and his bunch
have been fugitives
for years.

600
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,959
I suspect he's pretty good
at evading capture.

601
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,709
Something's wrong.

602
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,792
Before you go back
to your ship

603
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,792
there's something
I want you to see.

604
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:51,750
We were no harm to anyone.

605
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,166
Why did you tell them
where to find us?

606
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:56,208
You brought this upon yourself.

607
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,875
You and the traitor.

608
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:01,500
One does not need the technology
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

609
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,959
to follow
Mistress Ariel

610
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:06,250
sneaking out
to warn her husband.

611
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,959
Let her stand with him now!

612
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:14,875
For tomorrow
they will die together.

613
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:26,041
You claim to be
an advanced society

614
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,583
and yet you resort
to executions

615
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:29,834
in order to suppress those
who don't share your views.

616
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:31,750
I don't expect you
to understand.

617
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,625
Why? Because I'm
only a man?

618
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:40,583
You'll accomplish nothing
with that attitude.

619
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,583
Mistress Beata

620
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:53,166
if you had an alternative
to the execution of Ramsey

621
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:56,583
and his followers,
would you take it?

622
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,417
Is that not the way
of an advanced society?

623
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:05,458
Then let us meet with the men
from the<i> Odin</i> one last time.

624
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:08,750
Let me try to convince them
to leave here with us.

625
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,041
Will you also include those
from this world

626
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,583
who unwisely choose
to follow Ramsey and his group?

627
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:18,667
Yes. All of them.

628
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:27,667
(<i> murmuring</i> )

629
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:39,041
Mistress Beata is willing
to give you a second chance.

630
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:43,792
We're prepared to take
your entire group with us.

631
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:48,375
That's very kind
of you.

632
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:54,166
But we're not going.

633
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:59,208
Haven't you been
paying attention, Ramsey?

634
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:03,250
You're scheduled
to be executed tomorrow.

635
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,709
We don't want to die.

636
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:14,208
We don't want to leave, either.

637
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,166
There's no time to debate
the issues.

638
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:17,250
You're going with us

639
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,458
whether you choose
to go or not.

640
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,959
DATA:
Excuse me,
Commander

641
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:24,625
but removing any of these people
against their will

642
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:27,500
would be a violation of several
Starfleet regulations

643
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,417
not the least of which
would be the prime directive.

644
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:32,625
I realize
that, Mr. Data.

645
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,875
I'd rather face
a court-martial

646
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,250
than live
with the guilt

647
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,333
of leaving these people
to their death.

648
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,083
Commander Riker
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

649
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:44,083
This is the<i> Enterprise,</i>
Crusher here.

650
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,500
It must be worse up
there than we thought.

651
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,917
Doctor, where is
Lieutenant La Forge?

652
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:52,375
He's right here,
but he's in bad shape.

653
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:57,333
Notify the transporter room
I have 14 to beam up.

654
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,583
I can't allow it.

655
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:03,500
This virus is totally
out of control here.

656
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,917
Doctor, these people are
facing their death down here.

657
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:10,667
They might be facing
the same thing up here.

658
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:13,125
Until I have a better idea
what I'm dealing with

659
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,250
no one can beam up.

660
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,166
I'm sorry, Will,
but you must wait.

661
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,125
Understood.

662
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:25,208
Doctor, would this virus
have any effect on Mr. Data?

663
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:28,041
Not likely.

664
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:30,917
You're going
back there alone.

665
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:32,333
I want you to get
the<i> Enterprise</i>

666
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:35,500
into the neutral zone
before it's too late.

667
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:44,709
This is Data standing by
to beam up.

668
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,792
What of them?

669
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:02,375
I don't know, Deanna.

670
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,875
Mistress Beata
invites you to witness

671
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,208
this morning's
reaffirmation

672
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:24,458
of Angel One's
moral imperative.

673
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:28,333
Is that the civilized word
for murder on this world?

674
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:31,375
You send Mistress Beata
our regrets.

675
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,500
The Elected One
will not look fondly...

676
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,667
DATA:
<i>Enterprise</i> to Commander Riker.

677
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:38,333
They're still here.

678
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:39,834
Riker here.

679
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,500
Data, I gave you
direct orders

680
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,667
to get to the neutral
zone immediately.

681
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,083
Explain the delay.

682
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,625
To be precise, Commander

683
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:47,625
you ordered me to reach
the neutral zone

684
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,417
before it is too late.

685
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,792
After relieving
Lieutenant La Forge

686
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,417
I computed the length of time
the border outpost

687
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:55,875
and the USS<i> Berlin</i>

688
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,458
can safely withstand
a Romulan attack--

689
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:02,583
deducted our time to destination
at maximum warp speed.

690
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:06,250
That leaves Dr. Crusher
48 minutes

691
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,083
to develop an inoculant
to the virus.

692
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,417
Which means there's
still time

693
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:11,417
for us to do something.

694
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:12,917
48 minutes.

695
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:15,250
Ah, 47, sir.

696
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,959
Perhaps, Data, perhaps.

697
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,291
Thank you

698
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:22,417
for following my orders
so precisely, Data.

699
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,792
On second thought, Trent,
we would be honored

700
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:30,625
to witness your moral
imperative in action.

701
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,208
We have determined that
the heretical teachings

702
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:49,208
of Ramsey and his followers
are inconsistent

703
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,417
with harmonious
life on Angel One.

704
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:53,625
Our patient efforts

705
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:57,375
to silence revolutionary
voices have failed.

706
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:05,000
Therefore, we are
left with none

707
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,583
but the most final
alternative.

708
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:20,875
(<i> sizzling sound</i> )

709
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,583
BEATA:
As you can see

710
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,500
we are not
without compassion.

711
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Your deaths
will be

712
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,000
swift and painless.

713
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,667
Mistress Beata

714
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:35,583
before we see
living examples

715
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:38,625
of your compassion,
may I speak?

716
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,583
Is this a plea
for leniency?

717
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:41,834
Nothing of the sort.

718
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:44,250
As the governing body
of Angel One

719
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,959
you're entitled
to execute your laws

720
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:49,041
or your citizens
as you see fit.

721
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:51,667
Make your point
so we can proceed

722
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,208
with this
unpleasant business.

723
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,500
When you spoke
of the prisoners

724
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,667
you used the term
revolutionary.

725
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:04,000
Indeed, death has been
known to stop revolutions.

726
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,625
But I suspect it's
not a revolution

727
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:09,166
that Angel One
is hoping to stop.

728
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,834
It's evolution.

729
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:14,792
Mr. Ramsey and
the<i> Odin</i> survivors

730
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,625
did not initiate
the waves of dissent

731
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,625
that are rippling
through your planet.

732
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:21,333
Their presence here
merely reinforced

733
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,959
the change in attitudes
between men and women

734
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:25,792
that was already
well underway.

735
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:28,458
They became symbols
around whom others

736
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:31,917
who shared their views
could gather.

737
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:34,250
You may eliminate
the symbols

738
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,125
but that does not mean
death to the issues

739
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,166
which those symbols
represent.

740
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:42,667
No power in the universe
can hope to stop

741
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:44,834
the force of evolution.

742
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:46,834
Be warned.

743
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:52,709
The execution of Mr. Ramsey
and his followers

744
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:57,709
may elevate them
to the status of martyrs.

745
00:39:57,709 --> 00:40:00,834
Martyrs cannot be silenced.

746
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:46,667
Beata!

747
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:49,959
Stop.

748
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,792
We will adjourn
to consider your words.

749
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,709
Thank you.

750
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:26,291
I don't know
if it was enough.

751
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,125
Sick Bay to Bridge.

752
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,375
Go ahead, Doctor.

753
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:35,083
Bingo, Data.

754
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:38,041
Bingo?

755
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:41,041
I fail to see
the relevance, Doctor.

756
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,709
Is that not a reference
to an ancient Earth game?

757
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:47,250
It's also a reference
to success, Data.

758
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,750
I've got the inoculant.

759
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,166
Excellent, Doctor.

760
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:53,041
We still have 17 minutes left.

761
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:56,000
I will inform
the away team immediately.

762
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,625
<i>Enterprise</i> to Riker.

763
00:41:57,625 --> 00:42:00,875
We are now ready to have you
beamed up, Commander.

764
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:04,166
Data, Ramsey
and the prisoners

765
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:05,500
are with us
in the Great Hall.

766
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,458
I want you to lock
in the transporter.

767
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,625
Prepare to evacuate
the entire group

768
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:12,083
but for now, stand by.

769
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,250
Understood, Commander.

770
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:31,500
After careful consideration,
this legislature has voted

771
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,500
to stay the execution
of the prisoners.

772
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,667
Their children will be
returned to them immediately.

773
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:41,000
Do not rejoice
prematurely.

774
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,542
Ramsey and his followers
are to be exiled

775
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:47,083
to a distant and
unpopulated region.

776
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:49,583
Life will be
difficult there

777
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:50,917
with little time

778
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:53,417
left for revolutionary...

779
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:55,667
or evolutionary upheaval.

780
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:58,125
As some have
observed

781
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:00,000
we may not be able
to stop evolution

782
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,083
but perhaps we can reduce it
to a slow crawl.

783
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:10,834
For a man, you can be
very clever, Commander Riker.

784
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,333
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

785
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,834
Belay my previous
order, Mr. Data.

786
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:23,750
There will now be
only three to beam up.

787
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,709
Energize.

788
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:36,417
Welcome home.

789
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:38,875
It's good to be back.

790
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,834
Are they recovering?

791
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:43,250
Slowly, but yes.

792
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,667
And the Captain?

793
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:47,750
(<i> hoarsely</i> ):
The Captain is fine, thank you.

794
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:54,250
PICARD:
Mr. Data has
been briefing me

795
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,500
on the away team's
comportment, Number One.

796
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,792
TROI:
We, uh...

797
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:00,959
improvised, sir.

798
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:04,041
Mmm... I look forward
to your reports.

799
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,291
Don't we have a call to pay
on the Romulans, Captain?

800
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,542
Indeed, we do.

801
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:09,959
Mr. Data, set course
for the neutral zone.

802
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:11,542
Warp six.

803
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:14,542
Coordinates set,
warp six.

804
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:15,792
On your mark,
sir.

805
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:17,500
(<i> barely audible</i> )
Engage.

806
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:20,458
Sir?

807
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:26,000
Engage.
