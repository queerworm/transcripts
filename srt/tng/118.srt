00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,875
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41463.9:</i>

2
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:07,709
<i>While mapping</i>
<i>the Pleiades Cluster,</i>

3
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:09,291
<i>we've been asked</i>
<i>by the Federation</i>

4
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:12,208
<i>to visit a group</i>
<i>terraforming Velara III.</i>

5
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,917
<i>Communications</i>
<i>have been erratic,</i>

6
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:16,500
<i>and there is some concern</i>
<i>about their welfare.</i>

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,375
Entering
standard orbit...

8
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,000
now.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,125
It takes very special people
to live in such desolation.

10
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,834
Visionaries who don't see
the planet as it is

11
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,333
but as it will be.

12
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,709
I've always wanted
to see terraforming
in operation.

13
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:29,667
Lieutenant Yar.
Hailing frequencies.

14
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,417
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

15
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:32,959
Velara III base,

16
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:36,291
this is Captain Picard
of the Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

17
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,750
No malfunctioning equipment
on either side, sir.

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,000
They are receiving us.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,667
Velara III base,
this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

20
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,417
Come in please. Over.

21
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:58,125
Maybe no one's home.

22
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,709
We are sensing life-forms, sir.

23
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:07,542
Velara III base, do you copy?

24
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:11,083
Velara base to<i> Enterprise.</i>

25
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,667
Yes, Captain.
I'm Director Mandl,

26
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,917
and I'm sorry about the delay,

27
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:19,208
but we weren't
expecting visitors.

28
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,500
Terraform Command has asked us

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,667
to see how you were
getting along.

30
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,625
We were a little behind,
but we're back on schedule,

31
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:27,959
and I'd like to hope

32
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,375
we'd be allowed
to maintain that schedule.

33
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,333
We alarm him
for some reason.

34
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,959
Your staff are all well,
I presume, Director.

35
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,542
Understandably tired.

36
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:43,000
We're working very hard,
Captain.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,917
Well, if there is anything
that we can do to help...

38
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:47,583
you and your staff
are very welcome aboard

39
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,458
for a change
of scene, rest.

40
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,500
We have some holodecks
which you might enjoy.

41
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,083
No disrespect, sir,

42
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,667
but we cannot afford the time.

43
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,333
COMPUTER:
Channel closed.

44
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,041
His fear is escalating.

45
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:03,375
If you'll excuse me, sir, I...
I really must get back to work.

46
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,417
I sense deliberate
concealment, sir.

47
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,542
Of what?

48
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,959
I don't know,
but it's intense.

49
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,750
Director Mandl, we've heard

50
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,709
of your remarkable achievements
in terraforming.

51
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:17,000
My crew would very much
appreciate looking around.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,500
This is not really
the best time.

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,750
We're at a very critical phase
just now.

54
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,792
We would require
no special attention.

55
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,834
I'm trying not to be rude, sir,

56
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:31,333
but this is really
very inconvenient.

57
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:34,125
He<i> is</i> concealing something.

58
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,792
It's more than
just being too busy.

59
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,583
Your announcement
about coming down

60
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,417
has sent him almost
to a point of panic.

61
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:44,750
Well, whether he wants us
or not...

62
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,208
Director Mandl,

63
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,583
unless you're absolutely
refusing us permission

64
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,291
to land at your station,

65
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,542
prepare to receive
our away team.

66
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,375
As you wish.

67
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,917
Counselor, perhaps
you'd better go along as well.

68
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:02,291
Aye, sir.

69
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,166
Someone that tense
can be very unpredictable.

70
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,417
Stay on your toes,
Number One.

71
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:37,208
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

72
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:41,417
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

73
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,000
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,083
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

75
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:51,625
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

76
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:55,792
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,959
Welcome to Velara III.

78
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,000
Please.

79
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,375
I want you to remember it
as it is now

80
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:25,709
because in a couple of decades,
you won't recognize it.

81
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:29,250
Luisa Kim,
gardener of Edens.

82
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,917
Commander William Riker,
USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

83
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,041
This is Counselor Troi,
Lieutenant Yar,

84
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,208
Lieutenant La Forge,
Lieutenant Commander Data.

85
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,667
Arthur Malencon,
hydraulics specialist

86
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:42,542
and Bjorn Bensen,
chief engineer.

87
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,667
An android?

88
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,625
And third in command
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

89
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,709
Where were you
manufactured?

90
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,583
Are there others
like you?

91
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:56,875
Both matters are subjects
of protracted discussion.

92
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,917
Remarkable.

93
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,959
Excuse me.

94
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,375
KIM:
We don't get
many visitors.

95
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,458
It's exciting
to have you here.

96
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,375
We weren't sure
how we would be received.

97
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:15,500
Director Mandl was less than
enthusiastic about our interest.

98
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,750
I should apologize for him.
We are at a critical phase.

99
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,291
Usually, he's quite charming.

100
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,875
We'll try to stay
out of the way.

101
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,333
We've never seen
a terraforming station,

102
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,000
and we appreciate
the opportunity.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,083
How much do you know
about the process?

104
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,250
Theories, reports,
but nothing firsthand.

105
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,875
Oh, wonderful.
Let me show you what we do.

106
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,667
Newcomers find
this imager helpful.

107
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:38,834
The other two
are secretive,

108
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:41,083
but she is as open
as she appears.

109
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,208
What we're doing is
so exciting, so inspiring.

110
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,125
We take a lifeless planet

111
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,750
and little by little

112
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,959
transform it
to an M-Class environment

113
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,333
capable of supporting life.

114
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:57,542
Terraforming makes you
feel a little godlike.

115
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,959
The first phase involves
selecting the planet.

116
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,583
That's very important.

117
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,583
It must have
the right mass and gravity,

118
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,667
a correct rate of rotation,

119
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,542
and a balanced
day and night.

120
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,083
The planet must also
be without life

121
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,792
or the prospect of life
developing naturally.

122
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,250
The Federation
determines if that's so.

123
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,375
Then, we take over.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,625
This station is Phase 2.

125
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,542
Phase 3 involves water.

126
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,917
Usually we create basins
using hydraulic landscaping,

127
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,792
but the water on this planet
is subsurface

128
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,291
and extremely high
in salt content.

129
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:39,333
We're just about to begin
pumping and filtering the water,

130
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,458
removing the salt,
oxygenating and replacing.

131
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:49,000
Next, we introduce
microorganisms,

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,083
and when the process is complete

133
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:55,000
we'll have a lush,
arable biosphere.

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,041
You make it
sound poetic.

135
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,041
I think it's the best
job in the universe.

136
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,375
The efficiency of your
hydraulic landscaping
is quite elegant.

137
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,333
It isn't yet,
but it will be.

138
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,583
Right now, I'm disturbed
by erratic power surges

139
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,667
in several
of the servomechanisms

140
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,000
that control the
hydraulic probes.

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,458
Could the
increased conductivity

142
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,375
be caused by
the high saline content?

143
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,917
That was my first thought,
but I...

144
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,333
BENSEN:
Arthur!

145
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,750
The factors do not
support that conclusion.

146
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,083
I'm Director Mandl,

147
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,834
and I'm sorry
about having been so abrupt

148
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:36,625
during our initial contact,
but being isolated

149
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,166
one tends to forget
the social graces.

150
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,542
Are you seeing
everything that
you want?

151
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,792
What you're doing
here is miraculous.

152
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,208
What we're doing here

153
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,542
is working a difficult
and demanding timetable,

154
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:51,083
and there will be no miracle
unless Malencon here

155
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:55,583
gets the hydraulic probes
back online.

156
00:08:55,583 --> 00:09:01,166
We are set to step up
to full conversion immediately.

157
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,083
Shouldn't you be
in the hydraulic
chamber, Arthur?

158
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,667
Now?

159
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,375
Yes.

160
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,750
All right, Kurt.

161
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,667
Geordi, this appears to be
the master subsurface pump.

162
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,709
You're right.
Very impressive.

163
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:20,917
This is interesting.

164
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:22,792
The water table
is a thin ribbon

165
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,291
between the sandy surface layer
and the rocks below.

166
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,375
And those two surfaces follow
that contour so precisely

167
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,709
that the water
maintains a consistent
depth between them.

168
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:31,959
Which would require

169
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,542
extreme precision
from the probe controls.

170
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:34,500
Mm-hmm.

171
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,917
Here we have something

172
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:37,709
that may be of interest
to you--

173
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,542
a vegetation graph.

174
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:45,917
It is really the key center
for successful terraforming.

175
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:50,542
RIKER:
Incredible. It's planned month
by month, decade by decade?

176
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:55,417
Every single thing
is specific and exact.

177
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:59,709
You see grand,
romantic concepts.

178
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:01,750
I see unyielding rock

179
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,000
under an
ocean of sand.

180
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Commander!

181
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,792
RIKER:
What is it, Deanna?

182
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:09,667
Malencon... he's in trouble!

183
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,250
MALENCON:
Help! Help!

184
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,291
(<i> laser bursts</i> )

185
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,500
Help!

186
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,291
Can you open it?

187
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,959
MANDL:
It's jammed.

188
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,667
(<i> Malencon screaming</i> )

189
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,875
(<i> screaming stops</i> )

190
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,000
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41464.3:</i>

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,667
<i>What began as a routine visit</i>
<i>to a terraforming site</i>

192
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,917
<i>has turned into something</i>
<i>far more serious.</i>

193
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,959
<i>Arthur Malencon,</i>
<i>the hydraulics engineer,</i>

194
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,041
<i>has been critically injured</i>
<i>by a laser drill</i>

195
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,041
<i>which appears</i>
<i>to have malfunctioned.</i>

196
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,458
PICARD:
Situation report, Number One.

197
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,208
For safety reasons

198
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,041
we're shutting off all power
to the hydraulics room

199
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,083
before entering
to recover the body.

200
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,959
Then we'll beam him up
to sick bay.

201
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,625
But from the look
of his wounds, it's
probably hopeless.

202
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,458
Keep me informed.

203
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,750
LA FORGE:
Data?

204
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,417
Go ahead, Geordi.

205
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,041
All set.

206
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,208
Data, we have your section
completely powered down.

207
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,166
Bensen has just locked the
master servomotor drive system,

208
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,291
so it should be safe
in there now.

209
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,500
I'm going in.

210
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,917
I will go with you.

211
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,583
Transporter Room,
this is Lieutenant Yar.

212
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,375
Two to beam up to sick bay.

213
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,542
KIM:
I want to go.

214
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,542
We should be with him.

215
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:58,375
Kurt, please come, too.

216
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,250
Transporter Room,
this is Commander Riker.

217
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,500
Beam up four
at my coordinates.

218
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,083
DATA:
Geordi, this is intriguing.

219
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,291
I have seen malfunctions,

220
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:27,458
but this is almost
as if the laser drill

221
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:32,250
seemed to operate with a will

222
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,291
separate from
its control console.

223
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,375
I can't explain it.

224
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:42,792
The laser blasts seemed to end
when the yelling stopped.

225
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,875
Maybe Arthur stopped it,
only not in time.

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,208
Not possible.

227
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,875
Then what are you suggesting?

228
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,625
Uncertain.

229
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,458
Geordi,

230
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,917
please return power to the
control console in this room.

231
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,959
I wish to reactivate
the program.

232
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,917
You got it.

233
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:18,166
I am now running
the base drilling program.

234
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,417
DATA:
Geordi, servos off!

235
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:27,792
They<i> are</i> off!

236
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:28,750
Data, what's happening?

237
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,458
Too much to explain.

238
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,250
Can you open
that? Do it!

239
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,750
La Forge to<i> Enterprise.</i>
We have a problem.

240
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,917
Be specific.

241
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:42,500
Data's in the
hydraulics room alone,

242
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,083
and we're hearing
laser blasts.

243
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,166
Get him out of there!

244
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,750
It's not working again!

245
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,208
We got to get
this door open.

246
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,917
Data, we can't get in!

247
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,000
Data!

248
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,875
Data! Data!

249
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:04,333
Away team, now!
What is happening?

250
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm going to beam him
out of there!

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,875
Bridge, this is
Lieutenant Commander Data.

252
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,625
No need to beam me up, sir.

253
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,667
The situation is under control.

254
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,083
Are you all right?

255
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,041
Yes.
Well, what happened?

256
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,959
Did you do anything
which might have set it off?

257
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,250
No, but the firing program
was dynamic.

258
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,875
The firing pro...

259
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,166
In what way?

260
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,917
It adjusted to my tactics.

261
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:34,041
It tracked with me,
anticipating.

262
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,291
A fixed program
could not have done that.

263
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,709
Are you suggesting
that someone

264
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,041
was controlling the aiming
and firing sequence?

265
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,166
That is exactly
how it appeared.

266
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,583
There was a mind
working against me.

267
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,875
BENSEN:
What did you do
to this laser drill?

268
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:53,542
A year's work... destroyed!

269
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,667
I had no choice.

270
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,625
We were attempting to trace
the source of the malfunction

271
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,959
when it attacked me.

272
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:08,083
How much more of this
useless fantasy

273
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,750
do I have to listen to?

274
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,875
None at all, Mr. Mandl.

275
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,458
Until this is resolved,

276
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,208
I've provided temporary quarters
for you and your staff.

277
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,041
Perhaps you'd like
to make use of them.

278
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,500
You're overstepping
your authority, Picard.

279
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,750
You have no right
to interfere.

280
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,959
Mr. Mandl, an attack on one
of my crew gives me the right.

281
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,625
I have a schedule to meet.

282
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,083
Your schedule is on hold

283
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,583
until I have a satisfactory
explanation of this.

284
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,792
Director Mandl...

285
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:37,417
Lieutenant Yar, would you escort
the director to his quarters?

286
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:38,625
Aye, sir.

287
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,166
Go on with your report.

288
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,250
It would appear the
laser's drilling system

289
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,750
was reprogrammed, sir.

290
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,792
As soon as its memory
bank received power,

291
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:51,208
it turned itself on
and went after me.

292
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,208
Fortunately, I was
able to cope with it.

293
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,875
And not by much,
from what I saw.

294
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,375
I believe it
was programmed

295
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,709
to destroy any person
moving in that room, sir.

296
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,375
Certainty or speculation?

297
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,500
Certainty.

298
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,917
That would have
required the talents

299
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,166
of a master programmer.

300
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,500
But it was done.

301
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,166
And so,
the question becomes not who.

302
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,291
Since it clearly was one of the
three remaining terraformers,

303
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,125
the question becomes why?

304
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,875
What are they hiding?

305
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,542
What could be so important
that one or all of them

306
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:24,000
could be desperate
enough to kill?

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,083
Shall I have them
brought in, sir?

308
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,667
Not yet.

309
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,458
Malencon?

310
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,458
I couldn't save him.

311
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,500
The injuries
were too severe,

312
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,250
the damage
too extensive.

313
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,000
The entire Velara III facility
has been powered down, Captain.

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,792
We just completed
a remote power feed

315
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,667
to the life-support systems.

316
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:46,375
Good. Data, I want you
and Geordi to return for
more careful inspection.

317
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,834
What are we to
look for, sir?

318
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,041
Evidence of tampering,

319
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,000
negligence, sabotage,
whatever...

320
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,542
The answer is there,
on the planet.

321
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,792
Tasha, I want you to provide
Counselor Troi and me

322
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,125
with complete personnel records
of our three guests.

323
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,875
Psych profiles,
training-- everything.

324
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,542
I'm looking for
motive, intent...

325
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,500
the psychological capacity
to commit one murder

326
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,458
and to attempt another.

327
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,834
Aye, sir.

328
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,250
It seems we are becoming
detectives, Number One.

329
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,792
Not much left
of this drill.

330
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,166
Geordi, I need
some visual assistance.

331
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,458
Whoa...

332
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,208
What is it?

333
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,834
Nothing but basic elements.

334
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:03,041
Inorganic...

335
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,625
no carbon...

336
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,375
sandy texture...

337
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:10,625
but those flashes
are almost...

338
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,709
musical.

339
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,625
I see color variations

340
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,667
and... rhythms

341
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:21,375
and complex harmonies.

342
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,125
Speculation--

343
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,458
could it be alive?

344
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,875
How could it be alive?
It's inorganic.

345
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,917
Whatever it is,

346
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:39,250
it could be what
they are covering up--

347
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,375
and the reason
someone killed Malencon.

348
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,375
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

349
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,750
<i>On my order,</i>
<i>Data's startling discovery</i>

350

352
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,834
<i>but unlike life on Earth</i>
<i>and elsewhere</i>

353
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,667
<i>it appears to be</i>
<i>completely inorganic.</i>

354
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,542
A test for inorganic life.

355
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,959
It has never
been done, Doctor.

356
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:07,250
There are basic
definitions for
organic life.

357
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,834
It must have the ability
to assimilate, respirate,

358
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:13,250
reproduce, grow and develop,
move, secrete and excrete.

359
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,792
Would any of those
apply here?

360
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,917
Perhaps growth
and development.

361
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:18,709
Reproduction?

362
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,250
Yes.

363
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,542
Those two may be basic
for any definition of life--

364
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,458
organic or inorganic.

365
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,458
Well, Doctor,
you're charting unknown seas.

366
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,875
So, how do we proceed?

367
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,667
Since we're dealing with
a fundamental question,

368
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,834
let's use the basic
scientific method:

369
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:35,041
observe, theorize and
attempt to prove it.

370
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,667
Activate.

371
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,333
Let's be sure of what
we're dealing with.

372
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,250
Is the sample organic?

373
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,959
COMPUTER:
Negative carbon.

374
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,083
Negative known life components.

375
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,667
Substance inorganic.
Mm-hmm.

376
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,250
Recheck analysis, please.

377
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,792
Rechecking.

378
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,375
Analysis verified.

379
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,542
Not organic.

380
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,875
Magnify to screen.

381
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,959
Factor five.

382
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,959
Hold surface.

383
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,000
Factor ten.

384
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,083
(<i> soft humming</i> )

385
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,166
What are we
looking at?

386
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,834
It's beautiful,
whatever it is.

387
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,875
What's that hum?

388
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,458
It started after Dr. Crusher
ordered the scanner to magnify.

389
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:29,125
Computer, demagnify.
Resume normal scan.

390
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,500
(<i> humming gets louder</i> )

391
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,667
Everyone stand back.

392
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,000
(<i> humming softens</i> )

393
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,583
Step back again.

394
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,834
(<i> very faint humming</i> )

395
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,625
It's us.

396
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,709
Yes. We're causing it.
Why?

397
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:54,250
Unknown, but it is definitely
reacting to our presence.

398
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,458
Perhaps it is picking up

399
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,709
the electrical impulse
of our systems.

400
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:00,000
The flashes haven't changed.

401
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,500
Could the hum be connected
to the flashing?

402
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,917
Computer, magnify.

403
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,667
What is the magnification?

404
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:13,166
2500 diameters.

405
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:17,125
Analyze the pattern
of the flashes.

406
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,959
Not repetitive or sequential.

407
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,792
Pattern not recognized.

408
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:24,542
What is the source
of the flashes?

409
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:26,625
Unable to specify.

410
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:30,500
Theoretically not possible
from this substance.

411
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,709
Disregard incongruity

412
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,291
and theorize as to source.

413
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,000
Life.

414
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,458
What do you mean,
a life-form?

415
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,500
What life-form?

416
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,250
A Federation recon
expedition certified
Velara III lifeless.

417
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,750
Understandable

418
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,417
given this particular
life-form's novel nature.

419
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:08,583
What is that nature?

420
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,750
Dr. Crusher is still making
her determination.

421
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,458
Mr. Mandl, you know
the Prime Directive.

422
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,709
Are you saying that I
knowingly defied it?

423
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:20,125
That's what I have to
find out.

424
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,792
You're a man obsessed
with what you do.

425
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:25,333
Who knows what an obsessed man
will do to keep going.

426
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,500
Kill, perhaps?

427
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,959
I create life.

428
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,083
I don't take it.

429
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:45,542
You hit him pretty
hard, Captain.

430
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,083
What do you think, Counselor?

431
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,250
It was useful.

432
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,917
I felt two levels.

433
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,792
He did know about the life-form,

434
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,375
but the idea of murder
seemed to shock him.

435
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,792
Whether it was the whole idea

436
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,291
or just being accused of it,
I can't tell.

437
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,750
What about his file,
Lieutenant Yar?

438
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,834
Could he have accomplished
the reprogramming

439
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,709
that Data says took place?

440
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:07,500
Mandl holds advanced degrees
in computer science

441
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,750
as well as
artificial intelligence.

442
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,125
It's possible.

443
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,041
What about the others,
including the victim?

444
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:16,291
Well, only the victim had
the required expertise.

445
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,458
Malencon did work
where the...

446
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,208
whatever it is was found.

447
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,917
Trying to suppress
that knowledge

448
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,458
would be motive
for murder

449
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,959
<i>if</i> Mandl were
obsessed enough.

450
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,083
Terraformers are
often obsessive.

451
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,959
It frequently goes
with the career profile.

452
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,250
How do you read
the designer?

453
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,291
She is possessed of highly
abstracted reality.

454
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,083
Lovely visions,
little data.

455
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,500
But you might do
better than I.

456
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,166
(<i> door chimes</i> )

457
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,291
It's not locked.

458
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,542
Mind a visitor?

459
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,500
Is it true?

460
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,291
Did you really find
a life-form?

461
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:19,125
Well, the debate
is still going on
in some quarters,

462
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,333
but I think so, yes.

463
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:26,333
What's it like?

464
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,375
We have nothing we
can compare it with.

465
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,500
It's microscopic.

466
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,291
It seems
colonial, simple,

467
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,208
but it's inorganic,

468
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,166
which is why the recon
scouts missed it.

469
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,625
It was not your mistake.

470
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:50,083
Everything I've worked
so hard for...

471
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,458
...is falling apart.

473
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,959
It's very beautiful.

474
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:14,083
I could arrange for you
to see it, if you like.

475
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,041
Perhaps later.

476
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:36,542
Captain, this is Dr. Crusher.

477
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:39,291
I think you better come
to the medical lab.

478
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,333
What is it?

479
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,709
Geordi observed
movement.

480
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:49,959
Not movement, exactly,

481
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,709
but a definite shift
in the energy pattern.

482
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:53,166
Without external
influence.

483
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,166
The hum is gone,
too. Why?

484
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,959
Unknown, sir. Perhaps
it is scanning us.

485
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,125
Scanning us?

486
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,166
Why? What would it
hope to learn?

487
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,458
Unknown at this
time, sir.

488
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,125

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,917
Aye, sir.

515
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:43,291
What's the nature of
the problem, Captain?
We've lost visual.

516
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:46,583
We have confirmed
that Data's discovery is life,

517
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,208
but more than that...

518
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,125
it is intelligent life.

519
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:55,375
How do you know, sir?

520
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,542
It's trying
to communicate with us.

Mr. La Forge,
can we see into the lab yet?

Negative, Captain.
Reducing the backup

528
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,500

might help.

I wouldn't.

00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:43,875
Not a thing.

538
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,166
Enough.

539
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,834
Sit down, Lieutenant.

540
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:52,166
You are deliberately evasive,
and it must stop.

541
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,542
You have kept information
from me

542
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:55,250
since our first communication.

543
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,625
An alien life-form
has taken possession

544
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,834
of my medical lab.

545
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:04,583
You knew of
its existence.

546
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,750
Yes.

547
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,583
Is this true?

548
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:10,166
You knew there was
life on Velara III?

549
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:13,208
I knew that there were
random energy patterns.

550
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:17,250
Yes, I knew that,
but not life.

551
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,959
Not by any definition
that I've ever heard.

552
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:23,000
But you tried to keep
that knowledge from us.

553
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,458
No, they are meaningless
silicon crystals

554
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,750
which rebroadcast sunlight.

555
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,375
It is a life-form,
and it has intelligence.

556
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,166
Why do you say that?

557
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,542
It's trying to communicate
with us.

558
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:41,500
Communicate with you?

559
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,709
When did you first become aware
of them?

560
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:48,333
Tell them about the pattern
in the sand.

561
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,125
Oh, yes, do tell us.

562
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,917
When we first arrived,

563
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:57,875
we noticed that
in certain areas

564
00:29:57,875 --> 00:30:00,709
the sand had
a sparkling effect

565
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:04,667
like sunlight bouncing off
new-fallen snow.

566
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,625
What did you think it was?

567
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:10,083
Honestly, we did not
give it any thought.

568
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:14,041
Picard, I must point out again

569
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:18,083
that we were assured--
not once, but many times--

570
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:21,542
by the best scientific minds
in the Federation

571
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:26,291
that this planet has no life--
no life!

572
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,333
And we were not looking,

573
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,291
and therefore we did not see.

574
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:32,375
All right,
at first you dismissed it,

575
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,166
but then,
you began to understand

576
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,792
that there was something

577
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:38,667
that was different
about them.

578
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,709
You can't know that.

579
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:44,792
Your apprehension suggested it
when we first arrived.

580
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:47,709
Tell me about these patterns.

581
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:50,125
At first we thought
it was just natural phenomenon

582
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:51,458
unique to Velara III.

583
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,750
Refraction

584
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,792
in a thin atmosphere
is interesting

585
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:58,041
but certainly
not life.

586
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:00,083
Why was I never
told about this?

587
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,917
Because it's not
particularly important.

588
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:04,542
As the building

589
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,792
of the terraforming
station went forward,

590
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:09,417
the patterns in the sand
ceased being random.

591
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,291
They became very specific.

592
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:15,458
Geometric shapes suddenly
appearing, disappearing,

593
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,166
uh, changing location,

594
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,500
changing size.

595
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Did you ever feel

596
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,542
that these patterns
were attempting to communicate?

597
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,417
No, never.

598
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,333
Bensen?

599
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,208
I don't know.

600
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:37,125
At the time,
I didn't think so,

601
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:40,792
but now after hearing
what you just said...

602
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:43,667
now... I don't know.

603
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:46,834
RIKER:
Captain, we've regained
magnification on the life-form.

604
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:48,208
It's divided again.

605
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,375
Patch visual
to observation lounge.

606
00:31:56,542 --> 00:32:01,208
There was no indication
of any of this on Velara III.

607
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,125
Absolutely none.

608
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:08,625
I cannot understand
the patterns.

609
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,625
Mm, neither can I.

610
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:12,500
Please show me
spectral analysis--

611
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,250
magnification 12k.

612
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,166
COMPUTER:
Silicon, germanium.

613
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:17,417
Transistor material.

614
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:18,792
Gallium arsenide.

615
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,417
Emits light when charged.

616
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,375
Cadmium selenide, sulfide.

617
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,709
Emits charge when lit.

618
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,375
Water, impurities,
sodium salts.

619
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,917
Conductor.

620
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:32,000
But is it alive?

621
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,792
Probability positive.

622
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,792
I wasn't
asking you.

623
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,709
Engineering to Bridge.

624
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:39,625
This is Commander Riker.
Go ahead.

625
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:43,125
The backup on the lab seal
is fluctuating, sir.

626
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,667
I think you should
come down here.

627
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:48,583
On my way.

628
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,875
Data, you've got the Bridge.

629
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:52,458
Inform the Captain.

630
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,041
Status, Ensign.

631
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,875
The quarantine seal
is getting weaker, sir.

632
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,542
Every time I try
to redirect backup,

633
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:04,959
it goes somewhere else.

634
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,333
I think I've...

635
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,583
No, no, it's locked three
people in a turbolift

636
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:12,500
and two more in the
programmers' restroom.

637
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,375
If that reading is right,
there is no seal.

638
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,834
Give me lab
interior image.

639
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:17,333
Yes, sir.

640
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,542
Magnify.

641
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,083
Picard, this is Riker.

642
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,792
We see it, too,
Number One.

643
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:38,709
Get that seal back up!

644
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:40,667
But, sir, no matter
what I do,

645
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,291
the energy goes
somewhere else.

646
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,166
What if it hits
the sick bay or nursery?

647
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:46,208
Hold off.
Impossible, Captain.

648
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,583
We haven't got the power.

649
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:51,542
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:54,750
<i>The life-form, which has</i>
<i>significantly increased in size</i>

651

<i>is again attempting</i>

652
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:01,750
The universal translator
is coming online, sir.

653
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,500
Ugly...

654
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,417
ugly... giant... bags
of mostly water...

655
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:10,417
Bags of mostly water?

656
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:12,625
An accurate description
of humans, sir.

657
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:13,917
You are over 90% water

658
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:16,208
surrounded by
a flexible container.

659
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:23,417
Life force,
do you understand us?

660
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,709
We understand.

661
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:30,333
We ask that you be gone.

662
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:34,208
We call. We talk.
You do not listen.

663
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,041
We didn't hear you.

664
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,792
We come in peace.

665
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:40,709
Ugly bag of mostly water,

666
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:43,417
we try at peace.

667
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:46,375
You still do not listen.

668
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:51,291
Bag who drilled in sand of home
had to die.

669
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,208
It killed Malencon.

670
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,041
We see and hear you now.

671
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:01,041
We didn't know you were there.

672
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:05,000
You are beautiful to us.

673
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,667
All life is beautiful.

674
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:10,834
Bags in dome did know.

675
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:13,583
Caused much death.

676
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:16,166
Make us kill.

677
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:21,166
War is now with you.

678
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:25,000
The translator
is offline, sir.

679
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Can you hear us now?

680
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:31,625
Mr. La Forge?

681
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,542
Restabilizing,
Captain.

682
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:37,709
Sir, that chaos when we were
studying it in the lab

683
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:41,041
must have been the energy surge
of a reproductive cycle.

684
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,208
It is now a colony
of single cells

685
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:46,291
which organize as a computer,
and like any computer...

686
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,959
More is stronger.

687
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,250
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

688
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,667
<i>We have regained visual contact</i>

<i>this life-form</i>

694
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,834
The range of influence
appears to be concentrated

695
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:18,166
in the medical lab, Captain.

696
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:19,709
All nonessential personnel have
been moved

697
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:21,709
to the most distant areas
of the ship, sir.

698
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,458
Data, any analysis on those
bolts of light it emits?

699
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:27,208
That seems to be its method
of reprogramming, Captain.

700
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,667
Each bolt of light
consists

701
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:30,625
of negatively
and positively
charged ions--

702
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,750
a series of program
instructions, as it were.

703
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,166
It seems to have
a quicker rapport

704
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:36,709
with our computers
than we have.

705
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:39,834
What do you expect?
It<i> is</i> a computer.

706
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:42,542
Have we disabled the medical lab
computer console?

707
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:44,083
Aye, sir. As soon
as Data determined

708
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,667
the microbrain's method
of operation.

709
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:49,166
Captain, picking up a decrease
in infrared intensity.

710
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,208
Maybe the life-form
has reached its energy level.

711
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,333
Or maybe that's not
the end of it.

712
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,875
With single-celled
life-forms,

713
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,959
at least organic ones,

714
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:02,291
cell division is preceded
by a resting state.

715
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,750
The calm before the storm.

716
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,291
Medical lab on main viewer.
Let's use this calm.

717
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,917
It does seem dormant, Captain.

718
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,750
Tasha...

719
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:26,875
set coordinates to beam it back
where it came from.

720
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,750
Coordinates set, sir.

721
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,667
Energize.

722
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,458
Transporter power beam
redirected, sir.

723
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:46,083
We are unable
to affect it.

724
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:56,792
Life-form or not,
intelligent or not,

725
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:58,667
the safety of this ship
and everyone aboard her

726
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,291
is my primary responsibility.

727
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,583
Data...

728
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,250
evacuate all the air
from the medical lab.

729
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,917
I want a vacuum there.

730
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,667
(<i> staticky beeps</i> )

731
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:13,375
Environmental systems fail
to respond to command, Captain.

732
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,041
It appears the microbrain
has successfully interfaced

733
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,792
with our computers.

734
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,625
Picard, if it did try
to communicate with us,

735
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,375
we didn't
understand that!

736
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:30,125
It has declared a state of war
and we are on the defensive.

737
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:32,750
We have no control
over our medical lab,
nor our computer.

738
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,333
At this moment,
it has the power
to destroy this ship

739
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,041
and everybody on it!

740
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,208
I need your help.

741
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:39,875
Unbelievable.

742
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,333
It said you were trying
to kill some of them.

743
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:42,667
I need to know how.

744
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,125
I don't know!

745
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,917
What was Malencon doing
when he was killed?

746
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,458
There is a
very thin layer

747
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:52,333
of highly saline water
under the sandy topsoil.

748
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,625
He was siphoning
that off.

749
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:57,959
Perhaps somehow that saline
water sustained them.

750
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,375
It connected them.

751
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,625
I don't understand.

752
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,917
The microbrains
may be

753
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:03,458
like our own brain cells.

754
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:06,208
Individually, a cell
has life but not intelligence.

755
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,041
Yet when
interconnected,

756
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,667
their combined
intelligence
is formidable.

757
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:13,375
The saline fluid
is their circuitry.

758
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,834
And to prevent its loss,
they killed Malencon.

759
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,083
If we had continued
to remove that water...

760
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:27,667
we would have
destroyed them all.

761
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:31,083
A reason enough
for anyone to go to war.

762
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,875
RIKER:
Captain, it's happening again.

763
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,917
I think
you'd better get in here.

764
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,667
RIKER:
If this keeps up,

765
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,000
it will tear up
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

766
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,500
What can you determine,
Mr. La Forge?

767
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,208
Captain, our
sensors indicate
that the microbrain

768
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:57,041
expends a tremendous
amount of energy

769
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,625
during its
reproductive cycle

770
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,542
yet there is
no discernible
power drain

771
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:01,750
on our own systems.

772
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,166
Then, what is feeding
the damn thing?

773
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,083
We found traces
of cadmium salts.

774
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,542
Now, cadmium is a conduit
for converting infrared

775
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:09,041
into electricity.
Meaning?

776
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:12,333
Meaning the microbrain
might be photoelectric.

777
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:16,500
Kill the lights in
the medical lab, Mr. La Forge.

778
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,208
Let's see if darkness
will neutralize it.

779
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,500
Sorry, sir. It still
has control of the computer.

780
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,583
We can't do it
by remote.

781
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:24,375
Number One.
Aye, sir.

782
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:29,625
The life-form must have evolved
at that narrow layer

783
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:33,125
where the light got through
the sand to the water.

784
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:38,041
Drop the water
a centimeter below
the light penetration level

785
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,834
and they starve.

786
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,583
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

787
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,125
Killing the lab lights...

788
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,625
now.

789
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:59,083
It's slowing down.

790
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,917
It's getting
dimmer, too.

791
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,375
MICROBRAIN:
More light, please.

792
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,917
Only if you will talk to us.

793
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,083
We die.

794
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:15,667
Bags of water kill us.

795
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:19,875
You are like others.

796
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,667
We have no wish to kill you.

797
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:22,875
We never have.

798
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:26,291
You do not say truth.

799
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,667
We will end this war

800
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:30,792
if you will end the war.

801
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:35,041
Darkness... death... terrible.

802
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:40,250
Must go home to wet sand.

803
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,959
War over.

804
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,792
Agreed.

805
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:49,208
We will send you home
to your wet sand.

806
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:51,750
Picard to Riker.

807
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,625
Bring up the lights
in the lab...

808
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,917
just a bit.

809
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:03,625
Are you better?

810
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,458
Better.

811
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:07,959
PICARD:
We mean you no harm.

812
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,959
Do you believe me?

813
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:11,208
Yes.

814
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,917
Good.

815
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:16,583
It is important
that you trust us.

816
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:19,000
Not yet.

817
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,083
You are still too arrogant,

818
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,041
too primitive.

819
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:30,041
Come back three centuries.

820
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:34,291
Perhaps then we trust.

821
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:41,500
We understand
what you are saying.

822
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
We will leave you.

823
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:47,959
We will send you home.

824
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,500
Riker to Transporter Chief.

825
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,166
Pick up the coordinates
of the bell jar

826
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:18,750
in the medical lab
for return to Velara III.

827
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,083
Coordinates entered, sir.

828
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:29,792
Riker to Bridge.

829
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,709
Captain...

830
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:38,417
we're ready to beam it
back to the planet.

831
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:40,917
DATA:
<i>I wish we were able</i>
<i>to learn more about them, sir.</i>

832
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:45,000
In time, Mr. Data,
when we are better prepared.

833
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:51,208
I wanted to create
a place where living
things could thrive,

834
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:52,959
and all the while

835
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,667
I was about to destroy
the life that is there.

836
00:43:57,667 --> 00:43:59,750
Our apologies.

837
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,792
And respects.

838
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:02,792
Lieutenant Yar?

839
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:04,625
Coordinates set, sir.

840
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,875
Energize.

841
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:22,417
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41464.8:</i>

842
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:26,041
<i>I have declared an indefinite</i>
<i>quarantine for Velara III,</i>

843
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:27,875
<i>and we are now returning</i>
<i>to Starbase</i>

844
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:30,166
<i>with the three surviving</i>
<i>terraformers.</i>

845
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:33,083
<i>Perhaps the lesson we have</i>
<i>learned from this near tragedy</i>

846
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:36,291
<i>will prevent it</i>
