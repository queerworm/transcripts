1
00:00:02,709 --> 00:00:06,417
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44614.6.</i>

2
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:09,083
<i>We are approaching Starbase 313</i>
<i>where we will pick up</i>

3
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,041
<i>a shipment</i>
<i>of scientific equipment</i>

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,792
<i>for transport to a Federation</i>
<i>outpost in the Guernica system.</i>

5
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:17,750
<i>During the journey, we will</i>
<i>be hosting a special guest.</i>

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,792
( door chimes )

7
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:21,041
Come.

8
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,917
You wanted to see me, Captain?

9
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:25,250
Yes, Mr. La Forge.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,375
It seems that the
exemplary nature

11
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,709
of your work has
caught the attention

12
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,458
of Starfleet Command.

13
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:35,000
In fact, someone is coming
on board just to see

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,750
the engine
modifications
you've made.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,208
Who, Captain?

16
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,792
The Senior Design Engineer

17
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:43,875
at the Theoretical Propulsion
Group, Dr. Leah Brahms.

18
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,458
Leah is coming here?

19
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,375
( laughing )

20
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:53,291
Well, this is terrific.

21
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,166
It is?

22
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,166
Well, I mean, I've...

23
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:00,875
studied her... schematics
for years.

24
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,750
She was responsible
for a lot

25
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,083
of the engine design
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

26
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,542
Well, it should be
a very enjoyable visit, then.

27
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:08,875
She'll be transporting on board

28
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,625
as soon as we reach
the starbase.

29
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,834
Would you like to greet
her on our behalf?

30
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:15,875
I would love to, Captain.

31
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,458
Thank you.

32
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,417
( conversation and laughter )

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,083
You keep picking
at that uniform,

34
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,834
you're going
to wear it out.

35
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:38,041
( chuckles )

36
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,500
I guess I am
a little nervous.

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,125
It's, uh...
it's not every day

38
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,125
a man comes face-to-face
with his dream.

39
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,458
What?

40
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,583
Okay, you remember
about a year ago

41
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,667
when we were caught
in that booby trap

42
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:50,959
the Menthars set?

43
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,291
Mm-hmm.

44
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay. While we were trying
to get out of it,

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,458
I went down to the holodeck
to study an engine prototype

46
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,917
that was made when the
<i>Enterprise</i> was first designed.

47
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:03,125
And the computer... well, it
gave me an image of the engine,

48
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,834
but it also created
this hologram of the designer,

49
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,375
Dr. Leah Brahms.

50
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:13,041
So, you met
a computer-simulated female?

51
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:17,917
Yeah, but not an ordinary
computer-simulated female.

52
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:21,041
I mean, she was brilliant,
of course, but...

53
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,750
warm, you know... friendly,

54
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,583
and it was like we worked
as one.

55
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,291
I would start a sentence,
she'd finish it.

56
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,959
What I didn't think of, she did.

57
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,083
It was just...
so comfortable.

58
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,500
Hmm.

59
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,917
Okay, I know it was
just a holographic image,

60
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,333
but the computer was able
to incorporate

61
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,000
personality traits
from her Starfleet record.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,667
You know, Geordi,
everybody falls in love

63
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,834
with a fantasy
every now and then.

64
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:52,875
No, no, Guinan, see,
you've got it all wrong.

65
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,750
I'm not necessarily expecting
anything romantic here.

66
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,875
It's just, I know,
whatever--

67
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,834
Leah Brahms and I are going
to be good friends.

68
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:11,750
Dr. Brahms is ready
to transport, sir.

69
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,875
Okay, bring her over.

70
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,792
Hi.

71
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:26,917
I mean, uh...

72
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,125
Welcome aboard, Dr. Brahms.

73
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,709
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Geordi La Forge,

74
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,417
Chief Engineer.

75
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:35,875
La Forge.

76
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:40,208
So, you're the one who's
fouled up my engine designs.

77
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:15,750
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

78
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,917
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

79
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:21,792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

80
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:25,792
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

81
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:30,125
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

82
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:34,792
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

83
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,583
BRAHMS:
The matter/anti-matter ratio
has been changed.

84
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,083
The mixture isn't as rich
as regulations dictate.

85
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,542
LA FORGE:
Experience has shown me

86
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,625
that too high a ratio
diminishes efficiency.

87
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,959
I worked with the mixture
until I found the right balance.

88
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:50,625
The magnetic plasma transfer
to the warp field generators

89
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,917
doesn't correspond
to the recommended specs.

90
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,875
Right. Again, I adjusted
the flow.

91
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,667
Sometimes things happen
a little differently in space

92
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,709
than they do
on the drawing board.

93
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,000
Is that a criticism,
Commander?

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,625
No, of course not.

95
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,500
It's just a well-known fact.

96
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,291
There's theory
and there's application.

97
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,792
They don't always jibe.

98
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,667
You've charted a completely
new swap-out schedule

99
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,125
for main components
replacement.

100
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,542
You bet.

101
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:15,125
I found Starfleet estimates
for the MTBF units

102
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,375
to be unrealistic.

103
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,750
I simply determined
my own schedule

104
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,166
based on observation
and experience.

105
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,875
Is that going to be
your only defense, Commander?

106
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,291
That same tired rhetoric?

107
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,625
"Out here in the field,
we learn things

108
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,041
you designers couldn't
possibly understand."

109
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,291
In the first place, Doctor, I'm
not aware of needing any defense

110
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,166
and, in the second place,
if you're determined to be...

111
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,625
Dr. Brahms, you have
an incoming message
on subspace.

112
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,875
I'd like to hear
this message privately.

113
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,041
In my office.

114
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,125
Be my guest.

115
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,333
Thank you.

116
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,917
( console beeping )

117
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,458
Commander, I am picking up
some unusual readings

118
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,583
in the Alpha Omicron system.

119
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,583
At this range,
all I am able to discern

120
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,500
is that it is
an asymmetrical field

121
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,709
of intense energy.

122
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,083
What type of
radiation signature?

123
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,166
Unknown, sir.

124
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:06,583
The Alpha Omicron system
has yet to be charted.

125
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,500
I recommend
we take this opportunity

126
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,709
for further research.

127
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,917
Well, we're way
ahead of schedule.

128
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:17,625
Alter course
for Alpha Omicron.

129
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,542
Dr. Brahms, there's no reason
for us to argue.

130
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,375
We're on
the same side here.

131
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,125
I'm aware of that.

132
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,208
So, why don't I take you
on a little tour?

133
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,792
Show you the
adjustments I've made

134
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,250
why I think they work

135
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,542
and we can begin pulling
together on this?

136
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,166
Okay.

137
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,542
And why not start with
the dilithium chamber?

138
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,583
Okay?

139
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,667
Okay.

140
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,750
The anomaly is orbiting
the seventh planet, sir.

141
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,875
It is a mass of plasma energy

142
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,834
contained within
discrete boundaries

143
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:04,667
by an outer covering
of silicates, actinides

144
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,875
and carbonaceous
chondrites.

145
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,542
On screen.

146
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,667
Magnify.

147
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:15,834
Is it a ship?

148
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:17,917
WORF:
It does not conform
to any known design.

149
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,500
Any records of similar phenomena
in Starfleet listings?

150
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,542
No, sir.

151
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,542
This has never been seen before.

152
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:29,583
Ensign Rager, ahead
one quarter impulse.

153
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,834
Aye, sir.

154
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,208
Put us in orbit of
the seventh planet.

155
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,917
Keep us a relative
distance

156
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,750
of ten kilometers
from the object.

157
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,667
RIKER:
Alert science stations
to stand by.

158
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,625
Tell them to coordinate all
efforts with Commander Data.

159
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,917
Aye, sir.

160
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,250
What happened here?

161
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,667
Who did this?

162
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,625
You remember, the crystal's
been reoriented

163
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,709
to adjust the direction
of the lattice structure.

164
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,667
Remember?
Why would I remember?

165
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,500
Right, why would you?

166
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,875
Uh... well, the ship was
experiencing some difficulty,

167
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,792
and we made this adjustment

168
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,166
hoping that it would work,
and it did.

169
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,333
So, it was your idea?

170
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,375
Not exclusively, no.

171
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,125
It's curious.

172
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,875
This modification
was due to be introduced...

173
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,375
In the next class
starship.

174
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,709
Yes.

175
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,917
How did you know that?

176
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:28,333
Um... I didn't.

177
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,333
I mean...

178
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,625
Well, it's the next
logical step, right?

179
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,250
Listen, Doctor,

180
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,917
sometimes we have
to fly by the seat
of our pants out here.

181
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,750
So it stands to reason
that once in a while,

182
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,917
we're going to come up with
the same solutions you do.

183
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,792
Listen,
I've got a personnel review

184
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,542
scheduled to start
in about five minutes,

185
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:53,166
and I know it's been
a long day for you.

186
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,667
So, why don't we get
together later?

187
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:59,333
Sort of plan out our agenda
for the next day or two.

188
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,583
Agenda?

189
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,375
What it is we want
to accomplish here.

190
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,583
How we might best
go about that.

191
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,625
Maybe even get to know
each other a little bit.

192
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,500
It might
make this easier.

193
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,750
Maybe you're right.

194
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,000
Okay, great.

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,750
How about, uh...
my quarters?

196
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,125
1900 hours?

197
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,041
Maybe even have
a bite to eat?

198
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,417
I make a great fungilli.

199
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,208
I love fungilli.

200
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,583
Is that right?

201
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,959
Huh.

202
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,959
Sensors are having difficulty
penetrating the interior.

203
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,875
However, the radiated output
suggests a coherent system

204
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,583
of energy storage
and utilization.

205
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,375
RIKER:
Then it was constructed
by someone?

206
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,709
It is a possibility.

207
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,000
However, the sensor data
gathered thus far

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,667
suggests a naturally
occurring phenomenon

209
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,709
with biological
properties.

210
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:05,959
A life-form?

211
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,458
Yes, Captain.

212
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,375
RIKER:
Mr. Worf,

213
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,583
begin compiling readings
for transmission

214
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,000
to Starfleet Headquarters.

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,083
Mr. Data, prepare to launch
three level-5 probes.

216
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,959
Ensign, aft thrusters.

217
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,208
Standard
observational posture.

218
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,834
DATA:
Level-5 probe sequence
ready for launch, Commander.

219
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:25,917
On your mark.

220
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,709
RIKER:
Stand by, Mr. Data.

221
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:28,834
Aye, sir.

222
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,792
What would it be like,
Counselor?

223
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:37,333
No ship, no bulky space suits.

224
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,834
Just to live between the stars

225
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:43,291
and have the entire galaxy
as a home.

226
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:49,458
Captain, we are being probed.

227
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,625
Recommend we raise shields.

228
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,542
Negative, Mr. Worf.

229
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:56,333
We are curious about it.

230
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,375
It has a perfect right
to be curious about us.

231
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,208
DATA:
Change in readings, sir.

232
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,375
The life-form has increased
its energy output by 50%.

233
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,041
It is moving toward us.

234
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,959
Reverse course, Ensign.

235
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,667
300 kph.

236
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:12,875
Aye, sir.

237
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,125
Now, easy.

238
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,625
We don't want to alarm
or provoke it.

239
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,709
( rumbling )

240
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,333
( people shouting )

241
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,959
We are caught
in an energy damping field, sir.

242
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,709
Raise shields.

243
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,875
No effect, Captain.

244
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,208
Reverse power, full impulse.

245
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,333
Impulse engines
at full power.

246
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,208
No change in position, sir.

247
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,542
Red Alert!

248
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:48,750
( alarm blaring )

249
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,166
Mr. La Forge,
prepare to initiate warp drive.

250
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,709
Sorry, Captain.

251
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,542
There's too much interference
to form a warp field.

252
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,166
COMPUTER:
Warning.

253
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:01,583
Radiation levels at 65 millirads
per minute and rising.

254
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,792
Riker to Dr. Crusher.

255
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:04,250
CRUSHER:
Go ahead, Commander.

256
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,583
All decks prepare
for radiation protocol.

257
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,792
Acknowledged. Crusher out.

258
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,417
COMPUTER:
Warning.

259
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:12,458
Radiation levels at 300
millirads per minute and rising.

260
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,959
Lethal exposure in one minute.

261
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,041
Mr. Worf, ready phasers.

262
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,208
Minimum power.

263
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,667
Ready.

264
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,583
Fire.

265
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,041
Radiation levels dropping back
to normal, Captain.

266
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,625
Energy patterns are
breaking down, sir.

267
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:42,500
The radiation signature
is no longer stable.

268
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,041
Energy output
is negligible, sir.

269
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,375
Radiation patterns...

270
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,250
no longer coherent.

271
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,333
I believe
it is dead, sir.

272
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,041
We're out here to explore,

273
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,875
to make contact
with other life-forms,

274
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,917
to establish peaceful relations
but not to interfere...

275
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:27,625
and absolutely not to destroy.

276
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:34,000
And yet, look
at what we have just done.

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,458
Captain, everything you did

278
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,834
was consistent with established
Starfleet procedures.

279
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,417
Number One, you have the Bridge.

280
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,000
Captain, sensors
are picking up

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,667
a new energy reading
from the life-form.

282
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,333
Elaborate, Data.

283
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,083
There is a new concentration
of ionizing radiation

284
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:04,083
growing in the center
of its body.

285
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,500
Then...

286
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:13,083
perhaps it's still alive.

287
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:18,083
Okay.

288
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,458
Computer, subdued lighting.

289
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,291
No, that's... that's too much.

290
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,875
I-I don't want it dark.
I want it cozy.

291
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:32,125
COMPUTER:
Please state your request
in precise candlepower.

292
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,792
See, it's not a matter
of precision, computer.

293
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,208
It's a matter of mood.

294
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,750
Brighter than this.

295
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,000
Hmm. More.

296
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,166
More.

297
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,750
A little more.

298
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,792
Hold! Right there.

299
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:52,917
Perfect.

300
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:55,250
Now, some, um, some music.

301
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,875
Maybe, uh...

302
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,208
maybe a little soft jazz.

303
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,875
( music playing )

304
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,250
Mm. No, that's...
that's not right.

305
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,417
Let me think here.

306
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,417
Oh, I got it.

307
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,542
Uh, some Brahms.

308
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:12,750
A piano étude.

309
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,542
( music playing )

310
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:20,208
Mm... no, that's, uh...
that's too corny.

311
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,750
Hmm.

312
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,041
Probably everybody
thinks of that.

313
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,542
Computer, just give me
some guitar.

314
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:27,917
Classical guitar.

315
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,542
Doesn't matter who.

316
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,166
( music playing )

317
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,375
Yes. Thank you.

318
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,333
( door chimes )

319
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,709
( exhales )

320
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,291
Come on in.

321
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,834
Oh, uh... you've changed.

322
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,667
Yeah.

323
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:53,125
Uniforms are so... formal.

324
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:57,166
You're less formal than
any Starfleet officer

325
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,291
I've ever met, Commander.

326
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,834
Am I?

327
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:04,417
I really just wanted to make you
feel more comfortable.

328
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:06,208
I'm fine, thank you.

329
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,250
I'm sorry.

330
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,834
Come in and, uh, have a seat.

331
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,417
Uh, can I get you a drink?

332
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:17,667
No, thank you.

333
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,667
You sure?

334
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,291
Mm-hmm.

335
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,291
You know...

336
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,291
your hair... it's, uh...

337
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,667
it's different.

338
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:31,542
Different than
a few hours ago?

339
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:34,834
No, I mean it's different
than I expected.

340
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:37,583
Different from
your Starfleet records.

341
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,667
Oh, yes, I used to wear it up.

342
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,083
Yeah.

343
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,625
Why would you need to see
my personnel files?

344
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,041
Standard procedure
when guests come on board--

345
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,417
protocol.

346
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,750
I mean, it was nothing specific
actually.

347
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,125
Just, you know...

348
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,041
Commander La Forge...

349
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:03,375
if I seem to be
somewhat unyielding in my views,

350
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,834
it's because I care so very much
about my work.

351
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:10,542
Oh, I-I know.

352
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:15,166
To be honest,
people find me... cold,

353
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:19,792
cerebral, lacking in humor...

354
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,792
But they're wrong.

355
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,208
I assure you.

356
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,000
Well, I try not to be that way,

357
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
but when it comes to my designs,
my engines, especially the ones

358
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,250
on the<i> Enterprise...</i>

359
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,417
It's like...

360
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,250
they're your children.

361
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,041
Yes. Exactly.

362
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,667
So, naturally, you're a little
possessive about them.

363
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,834
You understand that?

364
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:52,125
Yes, I do.

365
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:56,166
You see...
I feel the same way.

366
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,875
That's amazing.

367
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,917
I don't think anyone has ever...

368
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,542
Sometimes I feel
more comfortable

369
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:09,375
with engine schematics
than people.

370
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:14,834
Well, maybe you just haven't
met the right... people.

371
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,375
You hungry?

372
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,959
I'm hungry.

373
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,959
Why don't
I just start dinner, okay?

374
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,875
Commander...

375
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,333
Please, call me Geordi.

376
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,834
I'm sorry.

377
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,959
I hope that I didn't put you
to a lot of trouble,

378
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:34,291
but I can't stay.

379
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,834
You can't?

380
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:39,083
I just don't think
that it's appropriate.

381
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,917
Oh, uh-huh.

382
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:44,959
I'll meet with you
at 0800 tomorrow?

383
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:47,500
I'm preparing
a list of discrepancies

384
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,291
that I've identified
in your modifications.

385
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,792
I hope--

386
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,917
now that we've reached
an understanding--

387
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:57,375
that you'll be prepared
to discuss them with me

388
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,125
in a more objective fashion.

389
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,583
Sure. Fine.

390
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,875
Thank you.

391
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,542
Good night, Commander.

392
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,458
Good night.

393
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:17,250
This new concentration
of energy was detected

394
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,291
only after the surrounding
material became inert.

395
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,125
Could this be some sort
of tissue regeneration?

396
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,959
DATA:
The radiation signature is
similar to the original pattern

397
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,917
but with significant
differences.

398
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:31,458
Some kind of reaction
to our phaser fire, perhaps?

399
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,291
I believe it is separate
and self-contained

400
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,125
within the body
of the dead life-form.

401
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,417
Another entity.

402
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:37,917
Yes, sir.

403
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,500
It appears to be

404
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
a smaller,
less-developed version

405
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,417
of the original creature.

406
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:44,500
Huh.

407
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,166
No wonder it attacked us.

408
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,709
It was about to give birth.

409
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:03,458
PICARD:
Doctor.

410
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,583
It's dangerous to generalize
about new life-forms,

411
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,917
but based on my experience
with other beings

412
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,667
who bear their young
in this manner,

413
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:14,291
I'd say that the offspring
is still premature.

414
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,375
Otherwise, it would be able
to break through

415
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,917
the outer body shell
of the parent.

416
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:19,458
Will this creature

417
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,750
be able to survive on its own
without the parent?

418
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,667
There's no way to tell.

419
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:27,375
We don't have enough information
about the biofunctions

420
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,917
of the adult,
much less the child.

421
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,083
Is there anything
we can do to help?

422
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:36,375
If we were in Sick Bay,
I'd try a cesarean section.

423
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,041
The first priority

424
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,250
is to free it
from the body of the parent.

425
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,625
We could use our phasers
as a scalpel.

426
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,333
Yes, that might work.

427
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,250
I advise against
this, Captain.

428
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,875
The parent proved to be
a threat to the ship.

429
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,500
We do not know
how the offspring
will react.

430
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,083
Your objection is noted,
Mr. Worf,

431
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:59,709
but we are directly responsible
for the death of the parent.

432
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:03,125
We cannot simply wash our hands
of it now.

433
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,875
Doctor, we will proceed
at your discretion.

434
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:13,166
Good morning.

435
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,250
Good morning.

436
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,750
The first thing
I'd like to do

437
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,500
is inspect the power
transfer conduits.

438
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,041
You realize the only way to
inspect them is to crawl inside.

439
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,333
I designed them, Commander.

440
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,500
I know what's involved.

441
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,583
Here we go.

442
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,709
Power taps-- watch yourself.

443
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,208
The acoustic signature
doesn't sound right.

444
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,375
You're probably the only
other person in the galaxy

445
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,041
who could pick that up.

446
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,750
What's causing it?

447
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,041
It's right up here.

448
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,875
I've never seen anything
like this before.

449
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,208
What is it?

450
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,417
It's a mid-range
phase adjuster.

451
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:01,583
Puts the plasma
back into phase

452
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,000
after inertial distortion.

453
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,542
This has never
been done before.

454
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:06,959
I don't even think

455
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,208
this has ever even been
conceived of before.

456
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,709
You should write
a scientific paper.

457
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:14,250
( chuckling )
Uh-uh, Doctor, no.

458
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,375
Writing is not
one of my strong suits.

459
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,625
But this kind
of refinement
should be shared,

460
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,667
and you deserve
the credit for it.

461
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:27,166
Well, maybe we could, uh...
collaborate.

462
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,458
Writing is one
of<i> your</i> strong points.

463
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,625
Commander La Forge...

464
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,417
ever since I
came on board

465
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:45,333
there seems to be something
a little peculiar

466
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,041
about your attitude.

467
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,041
You seem to know
things about me...

468
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,625
even though we've never met.

469
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,500
Well, uh...

470
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
( clears throat )

471
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,458
to tell you, uh,
to tell you the truth,

472
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,458
( sighs )

473
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,125
I've studied you.

474
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:10,875
Your writings,
your Starfleet file.

475
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,709
I've admired you.

476
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,834
You know, your... your work.

477
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:17,291
Well, I'm flattered, but...

478
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,125
And...

479
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,834
( chuckles ruefully )

480
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,625
Ah...

481
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,625
Well, I really...

482
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:28,000
I really wanted to meet you
for a long time,

483
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,166
and... I'd like to think

484
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:36,125
that... we could become friends.

485
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,000
Maybe good friends.

486
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,500
I thought you knew.

487
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,875
I mean, you know
everything else about me.

488
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:51,583
But, Commander, um...

489
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:55,250
if I'm hearing
what I think I'm hearing,

490
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,542
then you should know

491
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:01,542
that I'm married.

492
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,834
( chuckling )

493
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:10,875
( sighs )

494
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:14,250
Set phaser power
to three percent, narrow beam.

495
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,875
Three percent.

496
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,083
All right.

497
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,375
Here we go.

498
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:28,291
The first incision
is complete.

499
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,250
Ideally, the offspring
should now be able

500
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,000
to push through the outer shell
of the parent by itself.

501
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:38,417
I think it needs
a little more help.

502
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:40,500
We've done all we can.

503
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,875
I don't want to risk hitting
the offspring by accident.

504
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:49,959
Come on.

505
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:52,083
You can do it.

506
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,875
CRUSHER:
Ah! Captain,

507
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:08,083
I'd like to announce the birth
of a large baby... something.

508
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,291
Well done, Doctor.

509
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:14,709
Well done.

510
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,250
How could it have been
so far off?

511
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,834
It was based on every
piece of information

512
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,250
on record about Leah Brahms--

513
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,500
okay, with an admitted
margin for error,

514
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,375
but this is an error that's
about a light-year wide.

515
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,041
Not what you hoped for, huh?

516
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:35,083
Hoped... Guinan,

517
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:39,458
the woman is about as friendly
as a Circassian Plague Cat.

518
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:42,000
Only cares
about her work,

519
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,792
hates what I've done
to<i> her</i> engines,

520
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:49,792
and, to top it all off,
she's married.

521
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:52,000
The computer never
even told me

522
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,291
she was married.

523
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:54,834
Computer glitch?

524
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:57,083
Must have been.

525
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:00,166
Maybe it was your old VISOR.

526
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,625
What are you
talking about?

527
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:05,709
Well, the one you wore when you
were on the holodeck with her.

528
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:10,667
Guinan, it's the same VISOR.

529
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:13,000
Really?

530
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,041
Oh, I figured it was
probably the one

531
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:17,250
that lets you see
what you want to see.

532
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,917
( sighs and chuckles )

533
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,917
What's that supposed to mean?

534
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:25,083
You saw exactly what you wanted
to see on the holodeck.

535
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,667
Sure, the computer made it
look like her,

536
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:29,792
gave it personality,

537
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:31,834
but when it came
to the relationship, La Forge,

538
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:34,125
you... filled in the blanks.

539
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:37,041
And you had
a perfectly wonderful,

540
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,041
marvelous little fantasy

541
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:42,792
until the real Leah showed up
and ruined it.

542
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,959
Now, she's probably done
the most horrific thing

543
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,875
one person can do to another...

544
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:51,166
not live up
to<i> your</i> expectations.

545
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:56,792
So I'd take a good, long,
hard look at her, La Forge.

546
00:27:56,792 --> 00:28:02,083
See her for who she is,
not for what you want her to be.

547
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:07,625
( sighs heavily )

548
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,625
DATA:
The life-form's patterns
are stable, Captain.

549
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:13,625
It seems able to withstand
the solar radiation.

550
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,709
Good. Ensign, set a course
for the Guernica system.

551
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:16,750
Aye, sir.

552
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,875
We're not staying?

553
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:18,959
No, Number One.

554
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,083
We've done all
we can to help.

555
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,500
Now it's time
to move on.

556
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,667
This creature can
continue its existence

557
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:26,583
without any further
interference from us.

558
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,667
It might be wise to put
some distance between us

559
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,333
before we initiate
warp drive.

560
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,166
Very well. 500 kph, Ensign.

561
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:36,041
Engage.

562
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:46,667
Captain, it is following us.

563
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,750
Maintaining a distance
of... four kilometers.

564
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,083
Directly astern.

565
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,417
17 degrees to port, Ensign.

566
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:54,583
Aye, sir.

567
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,583
WORF:
It is turning with us, sir.

568
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,917
Increase to half impulse.

569
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:02,959
It is matching our velocity.

570
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:06,333
It's imprinted on us.

571
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,333
It thinks the<i> Enterprise</i>
is its mother.

572
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,208
Change in energy
reading, sir.

573
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,959
I am reading an
internal buildup

574
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,083
of gamma
particles...

575
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,500
Its velocity is increasing.

576
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,542
It is moving directly
toward the ship.

577
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:21,625
Evasive maneuvers. Full...

578
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,125
Report.

579
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,250
WORF:
Minor damage.

580
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,250
The creature is now
in direct contact
with the hull, sir.

581
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,959
On screen.

582
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:40,083
Mr. Data?

583
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,041
Sir, the life-form
is draining energy

584
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,959
directly from the
fusion reactors.

585
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:47,000
It's feeding off the
energy of the<i> Enterprise</i>

586
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,041
as it would
from its mother.

587
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,750
WORF:
What action should we take, sir?

588
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,000
None, Lieutenant.

589
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:02,500
None at all.

590
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:11,291
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

591
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,875
<i>Since the newborn has attached</i>
<i>itself to the hull,</i>

592
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:16,083
<i>it has been making</i>
<i>greater and greater demands</i>

593
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,250
<i>on the ship's energy,</i>
<i>but we have been able</i>

594
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,125
<i>to stabilize</i>
<i>our power systems temporarily.</i>

595
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:24,333
How long before the power drain
becomes critical, Mr. La Forge?

596
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:25,792
If it continues to increase
at the same rate,

597
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,333
six, maybe seven hours.

598
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,792
We may be able
to modify the engine

599
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,583
to extend that
a little longer, Captain.

600
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,166
Your help would be
appreciated, Doctor.

601
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,792
By then, Junior may
not need us anymore.

602
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:36,834
Mr. Data, is there any way
to determine

603
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:40,458
what the destination
of the parent
might have been?

604
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,125
I can attempt
to extrapolate

605
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,458
from the heading
it was on when we
encountered it, sir.

606
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,083
Perhaps it was on its way

607
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,959
to provide a safe and supportive
environment for its newborn.

608
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,667
We might be able to deliver it
to the same destination.

609
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,250
Which brings up
the question

610
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,458
of how do we get Junior off
the hull once we get there.

611
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:58,709
It's almost completely covering
the door of Shuttle Bay Two.

612
00:30:58,709 --> 00:31:00,125
If we open the door

613
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,583
and deactivate the atmospheric
force field...

614
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:04,208
The pressure
from inside the ship

615
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,125
might push it away
from the hull.

616
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,834
Make it so.

617
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:09,834
Sir?

618
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,875
Is the appellation "Junior"

619
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,625
to be the life-form's
official name?

620
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,041
No, it is not.

621
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,458
We can save
a lot of energy

622
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,583
just by improving
engine efficiency.

623
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,208
We've run into
similar problems before.

624
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,583
That's actually why I reoriented
the dilithium crystal.

625
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:29,792
And why you added the
mid-range phase adjusters.

626
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,000
Right.

627
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,500
Commander, it seems
that you've made

628
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,250
a lot more modifications
than I'm aware of.

629
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,333
Do you have a file on
all the work you've done?

630
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:37,625
Mm-hmm.
It's in the computer.

631
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:38,625
Good.

632
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,834
Picard to La Forge.

633
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,166
La Forge here.

634
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,083
Commander, I need to see you
on the Bridge.

635
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,917
On my way, Captain.

636
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:46,125
You go on ahead, Doctor.

637
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,458
Ensign Pavlick can
show you the file

638
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,250
on the engine
modifications.

639
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,709
"Phase coils upgraded

640
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:58,375
"to 55 field densities.

641
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:02,834
Plasma inducers interlinked
with generator."

642
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:03,959
Ensign?

643
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,875
Would there be
any other files

644
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,709
with data on the original
engine specifications?

645
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:10,375
I believe so, Doctor.

646
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:18,291
BRAHMS:
This file utilizes
the prototype engine schematic.

647
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:20,291
It's a holographic program

648
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:23,625
set in the drafting room
at Utopia Planitia.

649
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,709
I'll run it on Holodeck Three.

650
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:37,333
Computer, replay program 9140

651
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:40,375
engine schematic
at Utopia Planitia.

652
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,625
COMPUTER:
Program loaded and ready.

653
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,458
She went where?
Holodeck Three, sir.

654
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:54,542
I didn't think
there was anything wrong
with her seeing the file.

655
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,125
No, of course not.

656
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,834
Nothing at all!

657
00:32:57,834 --> 00:33:00,959
I'm with you
every day, Geordi.

658
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,959
Every time you look
at this engine,

659
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,125
you're looking at me.

660
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:06,875
Every time you
touch it, it's me.

661
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,000
( door opening )

662
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,041
Computer, freeze program.

663
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,875
Now... I understand.

664
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,583
No, you don't.

665
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,333
It's not the way this may look.

666
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,750
I called up a replay
of the program file.

667
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,333
I was all ready to compliment
you again, Commander,

668
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:29,458
for constructing
a program

669
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,667
which contained
the prototype engine.

670
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,333
So that you would always have

671
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,041
a baseline reference
for your modifications.

672
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:41,375
And now I find
that it's all about...

673
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:42,458
a fantasy plaything.

674
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,291
It's not like that.
I swear...

675
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,959
I'm outraged by this!

676
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:49,125
I have been invaded, violated!

677
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,583
How dare you use me like this?

678
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,417
How far did it go anyway?

679
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:54,875
Was it good for you?

680
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,417
Nothing like that happened.

681
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,542
It was a professional
collaboration.

682
00:33:58,542 --> 00:33:59,834
Oh, I can tell.

683
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:01,166
"Every time you're touching
the engine,

684
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,166
you're touching me"?

685
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,375
Real professional!

686
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,792
Look, if you watched
the whole program,

687
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,166
you saw what it was.

688
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,458
We were working together

689
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:10,000
to solve a problem
in a crisis situation.

690
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,959
How do I know how far it went?

691
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:14,667
How many other programs
did you create?

692
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,667
Perhaps dozens of them,
one for every day of the week.

693
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:18,750
One for every mood!

694
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,959
All right, look.

695
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,917
Ever since you came on board,
you've been badgering me.

696
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:24,959
And I've taken it.

697
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:26,750
I've shown you courtesy

698
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,500
and respect and a hell
of a lot of patience.

699
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,083
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Wait a minute.

700
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:34,417
I've tried to
understand you.

701
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,166
I've tried
to get along with you.

702
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:39,125
And in return you've accused,
tried and convicted me

703
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,542
without even bothering
to hear my side of it?

704
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:44,083
So, I'm guilty, okay?

705
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:47,208
But not of what
you think.

706
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,458
Of something
much worse.

707
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:54,125
I'm guilty
of reaching out to you,

708
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:58,208
of hoping we could connect.

709
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:03,917
I'm guilty
of a terrible crime, Doctor.

710
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:07,875
I offered you friendship.

711
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,166
WORF:
Captain,

712
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,875
its total volume
has increased by 8.5%

713
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,208
in the last three hours.

714
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,458
I now read it
at 46 million cubic meters.

715
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,875
DATA:
Captain, I have completed
the analysis

716
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:32,208
of the parent's course
through the system.

717
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:34,041
It was headed
for an asteroid belt.

718
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,375
Ensign Rager,

719
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,208
set a course
259 mark 318.

720
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:39,208
Half impulse.

721
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,667
Aye, sir.

722
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:43,750
Hold a position 500 kilometers
from the periphery

723
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,166
of the asteroid field.

724
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:46,250
Aye, sir.

725
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,333
Difficulty getting
a clear sensor reading

726
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:58,083
beyond 4,000 kilometers.

727
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:01,291
The asteroids contain
large quantities of meklinite

728
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,750
which is interfering
with our scanners.

729
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,208
I am also detecting
traces of Kefnium

730
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,542
a compound found
in the outer shell
of the parent being.

731
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,208
It is likely
the asteroids

732
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,834
provide sustenance
for this life-form, sir.

733
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:16,417
We could leave the child here.

734
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:18,917
If Data's right, it would have
an ample supply of food.

735
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:19,917
Agreed.

736
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:21,583
Mr. La Forge, are you ready

737
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,000
to separate our guest
from the hull?

738
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Ready, Captain.

739
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,083
Proceed.

740
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,041
( warning Klaxon sounds )

741
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:41,041
I am deactivating
the atmospheric force field now.

742
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:43,875
( whoosh of decompression )

743
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,667
Engineering, report.

744
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:55,083
PAVLICK:
The power drain
just jumped to 93%, sir.

745
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,458
Captain,
the offspring is emitting

746
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,959
high-frequency
radio transmissions.

747
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,291
Is it trying
to communicate?

748
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:02,125
PAVLICK:
The power drain is increasing.

749
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,375
Approaching auto-shutdown.

750
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,834
Take the engines off-line.

751
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:07,959
Supplement
with auxiliary power only.

752
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,041
All decks go
to emergency level seven.

753
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,166
Life-support
and critical operations only.

754
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:13,917
Mr. La Forge, what
is your status?

755
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:15,166
Sorry, Captain.

756
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,166
The bay has been
completely depressurized,

757
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:20,125
but... it's still hanging on.

758
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,959
I am detecting other radio
transmissions, Captain.

759
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:27,125
WORF:
Sensors detect movement
within the asteroid field.

760
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,792
Bearing 257 mark 161.

761
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:31,917
On screen.

762
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,125
Magnify.

763
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,834
DATA:
At their current speed, sir

764
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:43,834
the entities will intercept us
in... ten minutes, 31 seconds.

765
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,041
Weapon status?

766
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:46,458
Auxiliary power only.

767
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,875
Two seconds'
phaser fire available.

768
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,917
Ensign, power readings.

769
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:14,959
We're on auxiliary generators.

770
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,000
Life-support<i> is</i>
functioning.

771
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,792
That's about all.

772
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,625
Keep your eye on that
generator console.

773
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,500
We've got less than six minutes
to get that baby off our back

774
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,291
before his relatives
get here.

775
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:28,709
Whatever we try, Junior responds
by sucking up more energy.

776
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:31,834
Commander
I have a thought...

777
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:34,750
if you're interested.

778
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,750
Of course.
What is it?

779
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,583
If the baby is nursing,
perhaps what we need

780
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:43,667
is to find a way
to sour the milk.

781
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,875
If we could contaminate
the energy he's feeding on,

782
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,000
we could try to...

783
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,834
Make it unpalatable
somehow.

784
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:51,166
Uh-huh.

785
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:54,250
But the emergency generators
are all we've got.

786
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,166
And how do we modify them
without losing life-support?

787
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,875
Exactly.

788
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:03,875
Unless...

789
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,125
What?

790
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,291
Well...

791
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,542
this is a space baby, right?

792
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:13,000
I mean these creatures are born

793
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,750
they live and die
in interstellar space.

794
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,625
Apparently.
Okay.

795
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:23,583
All matter in space vibrates
in a specific radiation band.

796
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:26,750
21 centimeters.

797
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,917
Oh...

798
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:31,208
Oh, that's good, Commander.

799
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,291
That's very good.

800
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,333
If we could alter
the power frequency

801
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,041
so that it's completely foreign

802
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,667
to the life-form's
natural vibrations...

803
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,208
Might just give us enough

804
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:42,291
to pour a little vinegar
in baby's milk.

805
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:44,041
Yeah, we have to be careful,
though.

806
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:47,041
If we upset it this time, we
might lose auxiliary power, too.

807
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:49,834
If we're gradual enough,
it won't be such a shock.

808
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:52,208
Hopefully, it'll just
lose interest.

809
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,750
La Forge to Bridge.

810
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,333
PICARD:
Go ahead.

811
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:00,917
Captain, Dr. Brahms and I
have a plan.

812
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:17,583
WORF:
Two minutes until the creatures
intercept, Captain.

813
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:29,583
LA FORGE:
Captain, we're ready down here.

814
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:30,959
Proceed.

815
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:34,125
Lowering wavelength
in the energy system...

816
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:35,125
now.

817
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,583
Reading 18...

818
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:39,458
15...

819
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,250
13...

820
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,166
11...

821
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,792
eight...

822
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,542
five...

823
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,333
three.

824
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,500
Now at the two-centimeter level.

825
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,667
Any reaction, Bridge?

826
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:54,000
Negative.

827
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,083
I detect no reduction
in the life-form's

828
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,417
rate of energy
consumption.

829
00:40:57,417 --> 00:41:00,208
One minute, 30 seconds
to intercept.

830
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,875
Not sour enough.

831
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:06,792
Leah, take it down further.

832
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:09,458
Reading one...

833
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:11,166
point eight...

834
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:13,041
point four...

835
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:14,625
point two.

836
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:22,375
I guess it noticed
what we're doing.

837
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:25,458
The life-form is emitting
its high-frequency transmission.

838
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:26,959
Energy consumption is rising.

839
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:28,375
WORF:
Captain,

840
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:31,667
the creatures are accelerating
their approach.

841
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:32,834
They are changing color.

842
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:34,375
Mr. La Forge!

843
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,625
Captain, just
a little more time.

844
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,000
Leah, nudge it down
even further.

845
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,583
Toward .02.

846
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,250
30 seconds to intercept.

847
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,333
BRAHMS:
.08.

848
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,250
.05.

849
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,166
.03.

850
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:51,375
Now at .02 centimeters.

851
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,208
Auxiliary generators
losing power, Captain.

852
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,709
The entity has disengaged, sir.

853
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:13,041
Power levels
are returning to
normal, Captain.

854
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:21,333
Bring the engines on-line
and take us out of here.

855
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:22,875
RAGER:
Aye, sir.

856
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:27,625
Mr. La Forge, Dr. Brahms,
congratulations.

857
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,667
You've weaned the baby.

858
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,250
Good work.

859
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,041
You, too.

860
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,291
LA FORGE:
Well, yeah. I-I admit it.

861
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:50,917
I did get a little attached
to that lady in the holodeck.

862
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:54,000
The computer never told you
that I was married.

863
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,709
I never asked, see?

864
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:57,583
And the computer is notorious

865
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,500
for not volunteering
information.

866
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,583
( Leah chuckles )

867
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:05,041
You know...

868
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,667
I really owe you an apology.

869
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,917
No. No, you don't.

870
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:10,000
I should have told you
straight out.

871
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,709
Well, if you had, then I
never would have had a chance

872
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:15,250
to see the look on your face
when you walked in on me...

873
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,333
<i>and</i> me

874
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,583
in the holodeck.

875
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,208
The look on<i> my</i> face?

876
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,208
How about the look
on your face?

877
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:25,583
I will remember that
for a long, long time.

878
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,750
I wouldn't change a thing.

879
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,667
Except for the way I behaved.

880
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:38,959
I guess I came here with my own
set of preconceptions about you.

881
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:44,875
Well, I guess I'm just glad
that I got the opportunity

882
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:47,625
to get to know you.

883
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,750
The<i> real</i> you.

884
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:54,083
Me, too.

885
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:55,959
Worf to La Forge.

886
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:59,583
There is an incoming message
on subspace for Dr. Brahms.

887
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:03,583
Acknowledged, Worf.

888
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:04,959
La Forge out.

889
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:08,834
My husband.
