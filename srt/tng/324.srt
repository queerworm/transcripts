1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,625
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43930.7.</i>

2
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,542
<i>The</i> Enterprise
<i>has been in attendance</i>

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,458
<i>at the biennial Trade</i>
<i>Agreements Conference</i>

4
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:12,166
<i>on Betazed.</i>

5
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,375
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>the Ferengi are present</i>

6
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,375
<i>and I have reluctantly</i>
<i>consented</i>

7
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>to their boarding</i>
<i>the</i> Enterprise

8
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,000
<i>for the closing reception.</i>

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,834
(<i> people talking, laughing</i> )

10
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:23,834
(<i> rhythmic music playing</i> )

11
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,500
Check and mate.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,834
WESLEY:
Perfect.

13
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:51,291
The Queen's Gambit, finished off
with the Aldabren Exchange.

14
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,458
Unfair.

15
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,625
I-I couldn't concentrate
with all that noise.

16
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,083
WESLEY:
Noise?

17
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,291
It's Algolian
ceremonial rhythms.

18
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,291
(<i> snorts</i> )

19
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,000
A toast to the success

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,792
of the Trade Conference,
Reittan.

21
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:13,250
I must admit...

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,959
I had some doubts
when you invited the Ferengi.

23
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,667
They made a profit
and behaved themselves.

24
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:18,959
What more
could one ask?

25
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,875
Still, they trouble me.

26
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,709
We Betazeds are uncomfortable

27
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,500
with species
like the Ferengi

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,291
whose minds we can't read.

29
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,083
DATA:
Perhaps your
telepathic skills

30
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,500
are ineffective owing
to the anomalous construction

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,250
of the Ferengi brain,
which is composed

32
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,250
of four different...

33
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,792
Thank you, Mr. Data.

34
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,583
It was thoughtful of you
to invite Lwaxana Troi to be

35
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:39,875
part of the Betazed
delegation.

36
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,542
REITTAN:
Yes, Lwaxana and I
go way back.

37
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,375
Her first husband and
I were old friends,

38
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,417
and I've known Deanna
since she was a child.

39
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:48,166
I'm sure Counselor Troi
appreciates the opportunity

40
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,208
to spend time
with her mother.

41
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,750
LWAXANA:
<i>Little One, you could at least</i>
<i>pretend you're happy to see me.</i>

42
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,125
Mother, we're
among non-telepaths.

43
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,625
It's impolite not
to speak aloud.

44
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,500
<i>You mean talk</i>
<i>with my mouth full?</i>

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,875
<i>Deanna, please.</i>

46
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,500
Well, all right.

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,291
You want me
to say something aloud.

48
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:13,166
Have you ever considered,
if you'd stayed on Betazed,

49
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,208
you might have been
a happier person?

50
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,959
Let's not guess
what might have been.

51
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,834
I love my work
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

52
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,417
Yes, of course you do,

53
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:24,792
but it's all business
and no play.

54
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:27,166
You've got to enjoy life, relax.

55
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,750
Like I do.

56
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,667
Find yourself
the right man.

57
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,125
Think of your future.

58
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,291
Think of<i> my</i> future.

59
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,041
Lwaxana, Deanna.

60
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,417
Anything I can do for you?

61
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,792
Could I...?

62
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,709
She's as repulsive
as the rest of them.

63
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,709
Repulsive?

64
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,000
I find her exotic.

65
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,375
And what an advantage
her telepathy would be

66
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,125
in our negotiations.

67
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,709
To read our
competitors' minds.

68
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:08,041
Yes, that would
be valuable.

69
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,333
But she'd never agree

70
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,625
to use her powers
to help us.

71
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,583
I'm not so sure.

72
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:20,417
Lwaxana Troi of
Betazed, I believe.

73
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,166
I am DaiMon Tog

74
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,709
of the Ferengi vessel<i> Krayton.</i>

75
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:24,667
May I join you?

76
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,208
I was just
going to see

77
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,208
Captain Picard.

78
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,375
Excuse me.

79
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,250
Oh, Jean-Luc. Jean-Luc!

80
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,792
Come have a drink with me.

81
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,417
Tell me what you've been up to.

82
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:40,875
Perhaps later, Lwaxana.

83
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,542
Mr. Data and I were about
to show Reittan Grax

84
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:45,583
the, um... the, um...

85
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,583
the new door mechanisms
on the aft turbolifts.

86
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,125
If you'll excuse us.

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,625
Lwaxana Troi,
I desire you.

88
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,375
What?

89
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:05,250
You see, your Betazoid
skills would be
very useful to me,

90
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,417
and I find you
very attractive.

91
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:12,000
I am willing to pay
handsomely for you.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,875
I don't believe this.

93
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,792
You must be aware

94
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:19,000
that every female has her price.

95
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,625
Let's get one thing
straight, little man.

96
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,375
I am not for sale.

97
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,000
And if, by some chance,
I were to become available,

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,542
I would rather eat

99
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,041
Orion wing-slugs than
deal with a toad-faced

100
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,000
<i>troll</i> like you!

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,333
So go away and find yourself
somebody else to become

102
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,792
your property.

103
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,041
As you wish.

104
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,875
Now that you've totally
humiliated us,

105
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,750
may we return
to our vessel?

106
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,625
She is exhilarating,
isn't she?

107
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,041
(<i> chuckles</i> )

108
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:06,291
And now I want her
more than ever.

109
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,000
Lwaxana Troi, you will be mine.

110
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:42,250
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

111
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,250
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

112
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

113
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:52,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

114
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:56,667
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

115
00:05:56,667 --> 00:06:01,166
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

116
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,625
Are we at war
with the Ferengi yet?

117
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,709
DaiMon Tog has returned
to his vessel

118
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,375
and the Ferengi
have left orbit.

119
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,667
My mother will be relieved.

120
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:13,083
I hear she handled
the situation

121
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,792
quite skillfully.

122
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,792
An admirable woman.

123
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,959
I'll be sure to tell her
you said so.

124
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,959
LWAXANA:
<i>Come in, Little One.</i>

125
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,625
(<i> sighs</i> )

126
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,667
Mother?

127
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,792
Mother, please.

128
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,625
Oh...

129
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,375
Oh, after that awful
little Ferengi insulted me,

130
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,375
I needed to center myself.

131
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,458
Can you imagine
that dreadful little creature

132
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,041
talking to me like that?

133
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,667
Doesn't he realize

134
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:53,083
that I am the daughter
of the Fifth House of Betazed,

135
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,709
Holder of the Sacred Chalice
of Rixx?

136
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,333
The Sacred Chalice of Rixx
is an old clay pot

137
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,417
with mold growing
inside it.

138
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:04,125
Oh, well, perhaps one day,
when you're older and wiser,

139
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,959
you'll understand.

140
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,458
Come on, Little One, sit down.

141
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,917
Talk to me.

142
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,625
We spend
so little time together.

143
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,625
That's true.

144
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:17,625
I'm sorry, and I didn't mean
to get so upset with you

145
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,583
at the reception.

146
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,375
Oh, no.
Deanna, try to understand.

147
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,125
You're all I have.

148
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,000
My only concern
is for your happiness.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,875
I am happy.

150
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,417
Why can't you believe that?

151
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh, I wish I could,
but how much happiness is there

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,917
in always being there
for someone else

153
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,500
and never being there
for yourself?

154
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,792
I get a great deal
of satisfaction out of my work.

155
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,417
Oh, well, I'm sure you do.

156
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:46,834
I'm sure it's very rewarding
in its way, but...

157
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:47,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

158
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,000
...what about a family?

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,250
This is my family--

160
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,834
my friends,
here on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

161
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,959
All right, in case I have
to spell it out for you,

162
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,625
I am talking about finding
a husband, having a child.

163
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,333
That's what made me happy.

164
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,917
At least, until now.

165
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:10,792
Mother, look, perhaps
someday I will marry,

166
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,458
but you have to let me
make my own choices,

167
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,375
live my own life,
and not the life

168
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,834
that you would
choose for me.

169
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,667
You had your chance
with Commander Riker.

170
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,375
Look how you ruined that.

171
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,875
I did not ruin anything.

172
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,166
We've become
very good friends.

173
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,625
Well, all the better.

174
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,750
You certainly wouldn't want
to marry an enemy.

175
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,917
I see we can't talk
about this.

176
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:36,375
Very well, have it your own way,
Little One.

177
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,667
Little One?!

178
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,709
You called me that
when I was five.

179
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:44,750
Now stop demeaning me
and address me as an adult.

180
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,375
<i>I'll be home on Betazed</i>
<i>if you need me, Little...</i>

181
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,625
<i>Deanna.</i>

182
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,166
Adding preprocessors
to the neutrino counters

183
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,667
boosted efficiency by 11%.

184
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,792
Of course, Commander La Forge
and Commander Data

185
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:02,834
did most of the work...

186
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,208
Not so fast, Wesley.

187
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,333
Reprocessing the data
with an optical chip

188
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,500
was your idea.

189
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,625
That is correct, sir.

190
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,041
Although Commander La Forge
and I designed the chip,

191
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,792
Mr. Crusher derived the equation
governing its operation.

192
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:17,417
The point is, you completed the
upgrade well ahead of schedule.

193
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,500
Very impressive.

194
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,667
Indeed. Fine work.

195
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,583
We shall miss you,
Mr. Crusher.

196
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,458
As you've guessed, final
entrance examination scores

197
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,834
from Starfleet Academy
have arrived.

198
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,166
Congratulations.

199
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,583
As soon as you have
completed the oral exam,

200
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,500
you'll be formally admitted.

201
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,375
We'll have you
back at Betazed
in plenty of time

202
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,291
to meet up with the
Academy transport ship.

203
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,917
Thank you, sir.

204
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:40,709
That'll be all.

205
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,709
Number One, a moment.

206
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,041
Yes, Captain?

207
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,250
You'll agree that this is a
fairly routine mapping mission?

208
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,458
Yes, sir.

209
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,750
Counselor Troi
had the good sense

210
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,291
to<i> ask</i> for shore leave.

211
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,250
I can see I'm going to have
to<i> suggest</i> it to you.

212
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,458
Have a good time, Number One.

213
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,250
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

214
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,542
(<i> Deanna laughing</i> )

215
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,375
RIKER:
...your mother.

216
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,792
I think it's around here
somewhere.

217
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,083
Well, maybe it died.

218
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,625
It has been a few years.

219
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,208
<i>Muktok</i> live
for hundreds of years.

220
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,834
Here it is.

221
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,125
Oh!

222
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh... oh, it's lovely.

223
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,291
(<i> musical tinkling</i> )

224
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,667
I remember that sound

225
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:49,083
and all the good times we had.

226
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,959
I remember a certain
junior officer

227
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,834
meeting a very serious
psychology student.

228
00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:00,333
The best part about
being assigned to Betazed.

229
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,792
LWAXANA:
Ah, this is the perfect spot.

230
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,792
Put the food down
over there, Mr. Homn.

231
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:11,709
Oh, isn't it a beautiful day
for a picnic?

232
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:13,709
(<i> sighing</i> )
Oh, they'll be joining us
in a moment.

233
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:15,583
No, no, not that.
Here, I-I-I...

234
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,250
Put the food over there.

235
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,709
No, no, you can
go back...

236
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:21,792
Mother, how did you know
about this place?

237
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:24,834
Your father used
to bring me here.

238
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:26,208
Sit down.

239
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,375
RIKER:
And you even brought provisions.

240
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,834
Very thoughtful.

241
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,834
Here, Will, Deanna.

242
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,458
Try an oskoid.

243
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,250
They're delicious.

244
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,083
You see, that sap

245
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,083
running through the veins
helps keep it warm.

246
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,333
Very tasty.

247
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,125
So, tell us, Lwaxana,
the last time we met,

248
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,583
you were looking
for a husband.

249
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,083
Have you had any luck?

250
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:58,959
Alas, no, but what happens to me
isn't important.

251
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,625
I am much more concerned

252
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,542
with other people
getting on with their lives.

253
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,041
Mother.

254
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,917
Mr. Homn,

255
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:11,500
I noticed some uttaberries
back along the path.

256
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,709
Pick some.

257
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,000
Well, Mr. Homn and I
could go back home

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,041
if you two
would like to be alone.

259
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,291
It's, uh,
such a romantic setting.

260
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,667
Mother, stop it!

261
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:26,792
Darling, you have been
so excitable lately.

262
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,667
Have you ever thought

263
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:29,709
of a leave of absence?

264
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,291
I could talk
to Jean-Luc.

265
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,709
Try the oskoid.

266
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:33,875
Very different.

267
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,083
(<i> hum of an active transport)</i>

268
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,917
What the...?
Oh.

269
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:43,500
For one whose beauty surpasses
even these pericules.

270
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,083
DaiMon Tog,

271
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,458
I thought the<i> Krayton</i>
left orbit hours ago.

272
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,000
It did.

273
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,709
But when I tried to get
the image of Lwaxana Troi

274
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:54,166
out of my mind,
I could not succeed.

275
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,875
This is ludicrous.

276
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,959
You mean, you came all the way
back to Betazed for me?

277
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:01,709
Why continue to search
for perfection

278
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:03,875
once you have
found it?

279
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,583
I don't believe this.

280
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,083
Now, look,<i> demon</i> Tog

281
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,500
or whatever
you call yourself,

282
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,208
I am the daughter
of the Fifth House,

283
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,166
Holder of
the Scared Chalice of Rixx,

284
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,875
Heir to the Holy Rings
of Betazed,

285
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,500
and unless you want to create
an interstellar incident,

286
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,333
you had better
beam back to your ship.

287
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,917
Returning to my ship
is exactly what I had in mind.

288
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,500
<i>Krayton,</i> transport four
immediately.

289
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,291
No, Tog...

290
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,792

King's Level.

292
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:01,750
FERENGI 2:

296
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,625
Lwaxana?

297
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,458
Oh...

298
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,250
Deanna?

299
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,458
Where are we?

300
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,041
From the smell
of things

301
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,458
I'd say we're aboard
a Ferengi vessel.

302
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,667
The Ferengi can't do that.

303
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:30,959
You're Starfleet officers.

304
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,792
Well, Tog must not
have read that chapter

305
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,417
in the Ferengi
<i>Book of Etiquette.</i>

306
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,000
<i>Enterprise?</i>

307
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,542
Must be too far
out of range.

308
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:41,792
Oh...

309
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,000
(<i> yelps</i> )

310
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,375
(<i> both gasp</i> )

311
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,250
DaiMon, they have
regained consciousness.

312
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,792
Very good.

313
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:07,083
(<i> gasps</i> )

314
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,625
I should have known.

315
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,583
Even their transporters
can't be trusted.

316
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,500
Why have you removed

317
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,875
our clothing?

318
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,500
Females do not deserve
the honor of clothing.

319
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,667
They're as bad as humans.

320
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,166
Look at that leer
on his face.

321
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:33,417
No, his is an expression
of revulsion,

322
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:36,333
but it is a feeling that
I do not share, Lwaxana.

323
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:45,709
Oh, uh...

324
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:47,041
Well, it's cold in here.

325
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,750
Do you want me to become ill?

326
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,417
You must forgive the Doctor.

327
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:54,750
He is not accustomed to dealing
with Betazoid females.

328
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,333
Now, Lwaxana,

329
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,458
I have a, uh,
business proposition for you.

330
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,625
Thanks, but I'm not interested
in any of your propositions.

331
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,333
Hear me out.

332
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,333
Your telepathic powers could
bring us both great profit.

333
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,417
Huh. Why would I want
to bring you profit?

334
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:14,333
In order to keep your daughter
alive and healthy, for one.

335
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,959
TOG:
There is no need for threats.

336
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,750
Lwaxana is a sensible female.

337
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,750
<i>I don't like the sound of this,</i>
<i>Mother.</i>

338
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,000
<i>I believe I can control him,</i>
<i>Little One.</i>

339
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,959
I'm sure that, uh...
we can talk about this.

340
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:31,792
Just the<i> two</i> of us.

341
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:34,667
A wise choice.

342
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,625
Farek, leave us.

343
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,000
Wel...

344
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,333
And you may rejoin

345
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,375
your friend.

346
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,959
<i>Mother, are you sure?</i>

347
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,750
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

348
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,000
(<i> console beeps</i> )

349
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,917
Mm.

350
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,500
(<i> chuckles nervously</i> )

351
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,083
And now, Lwaxana Troi...

352
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,000
let us talk.

353
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:37,917
15 hours from Gamma Erandi
and already the subspace static

354
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,959
is playing hell
with the communications.

355
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,458
Just what you'd expect
from a stellar nursery.

356
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,834
Wesley, congratulations

357
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:46,333
on passing your Starfleet
written examination.

358
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,667
An excellent achievement.

359
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,125
Thanks, Data.

360
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,417
Now, if I can just do as
well on the oral exams.

361
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:52,583
Not to worry, you will.

362
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,041
And when you return,

363
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,333
we'll be gaining the best ensign
in the fleet.

364
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,917
There is no guarantee

365
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,542
that Wesley will be reassigned
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

366
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:03,959
91% of Starfleet graduates
are not posted

367
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:06,417
to Galaxy-class starships
on their first assignment.

368
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,333
I never thought of that.

369
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,083
I always assumed I'd be
coming back to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

370
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,041
Well, I'm sure Captain Picard
will request you.

371
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,667
That is, if he's still

372
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,959
commanding the<i> Enterprise</i>
when you graduate.

373
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:22,458
I never thought of that either.

374
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,625
I never thought
I'd feel this way

375
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,166
about leaving you guys
and the<i> Enterprise.</i>

376
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,667
Is that not part
of the human experience?

377
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,125
Growth and change?

378
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,375
Well, I suppose so, but...

379
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,542
Listen, Wesley,
I felt the same way

380
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,375
when I left my family
to go to the Academy,

381
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,333
but it was one
of the best times of my life.

382
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,709
You're going to meet new friends
and have adventures

383
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:42,709
that you can't
even imagine yet.

384
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,667
I hope you're right, Geordi.

385
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,792
LWAXANA:
<i>Oh, Little One,</i>

386
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:51,750
<i>Tog's given me something</i>
<i>perfectly hideous to wear.</i>

387
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,291
<i>He says it flatters my beauty.</i>

388
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,709
(<i> chuckles</i> )

389
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,166
So far, Mother's
in no danger.

390
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:08,291
I hope she knows
what she's doing.

391
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,750
Well, she's bought us
some time.

392
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,041
Let's make the most of it.

393
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,709
I wouldn't do that.

394
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,834
I don't need your help.

395
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:19,291
The hell you don't.

396
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,375
You're two moves away
from being mated.

397
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,000
(<i> growls</i> )

398
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,625
See? You should have
listened to me.

399
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,500
Now you've only got
one possible escape...

400
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,041
(<i> grunts</i> )

401
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,291
That wasn't it.

402
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,208
(<i> laughs</i> )

403
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,166
You should have moved
the bishop.

404
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,667
Ridiculous!
The bishop was pinned.

405
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:51,083
Don't listen to me.

406
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,041
Forget the fact
that I beat you in 30 moves.

407
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,750
Pure luck.

408
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,000
I was being polite.

409
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,333
I could have won in 20.

410
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,000
Then prove it.

411
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:12,959
Pawn to Queen Four,
King's Level.

412
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:16,458
Pawn to King's Bishop Three,
Queen's Level.

413
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:27,583
I must admit, when you, uh,
first approached me

414
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:31,083
aboard the<i> Enterprise,</i>
I was... intrigued.

415
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,917
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
You mean revolted.

416
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,667
Perhaps a little.

417
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,875
Do you forgive me?

418
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,041
Yes.

419
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,041
But with your powers,

420
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,792
we could be a
formidable team.

421
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:51,750
My, you have great strength
in your hands.

422
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,667
And you like that?

423
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:57,959
(<i> sighs</i> ):
I have always admired
strong males.

424
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,583
You are beautiful.

425
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:04,875
It is impossible
for me to resist you.

426
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:09,000
Then, uh... don't.

427
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:34,625
Initial scans of ionization
patterns complete, sir.

428
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,125
Now correlating sensor readings.

429
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,000
It's almost
incomprehensible--

430
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,417
the amount of energy
being expended.

431
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:49,834
Actually, it is 5.34 times
ten to the 41st watt, sir.

432
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:51,959
Well within the norm for
this type of phenomenon.

433
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,959
Yes, yes, yes, perhaps, Data.

434
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,417
But that takes away
none of the wonder.

435
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,291
Check.

436
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:08,750
I'm sick of this game.

437
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,834
Of course, now that
you are losing.

438
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:12,083
Who's losing?

439
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,166
I'm just tired of standing up.

440
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,208
You can't resign now.

441
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,500
It's hard to play from in here.

442
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,959
I can't even see
the whole board.

443
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,291
Ah.

444
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,125
Then you'll finish the game
if I let you

445
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,542
out of the cell?

446
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:24,667
I might.

447
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,291
(<i> laughs</i> )

448
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,166
Clever, human,
but I'm not that foolish.

449
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,500
What, do you think
I'm going to try to escape?

450
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,667
What would that get me?

451
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,000
You've already got her.

452
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:37,375
Besides, where would I go?

453
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,375
I do not trust you.

454
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,834
Fine.

455
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:43,375
Thanks for the game.

456
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:54,709
Come out here.

457
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,750
Now save your
rook, if you can.

458
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,709
...and that was
my first husband.

459
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,125
Not much
of a conversationalist

460
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:26,375
but, uh... what a lover.

461
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:29,625
Well, then I met...

462
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:33,834
I do not want to hear
about your other romances.

463
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,917
It makes me jealous.

464
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:43,375
My, my, what, uh...
big ears you have.

465
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:46,667
Has anyone ever told you
how attractive they are?

466
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:47,750
Some females

467
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,417
think they are my best feature.

468
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,083
No one has ever given me
<i>oo-mox</i> like this before.

469
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,667
<i>Oo-mox?</i>

470
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:00,083
There's no translation,

471
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,834
but the ear is
one of our most

472
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:04,959
erogenous zones.

473
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:10,583
Those Ferengi
have iron jaws.

474
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:14,917
LWAXANA:
<i>Little One, if Tog were</i>
<i>a kitten, he'd be purring.</i>

475
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:16,667
Good work, Mother.

476
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,166
According to Mother,

477
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:21,667
DaiMon Tog is extremely
relaxed at the moment.

478
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,583
Tell Lwaxana
to keep him relaxed

479
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,625
while we call in the cavalry.

480
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:29,083
COMPUTER:
Access to communications denied.

481
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:32,291
All transmissions
to be authorized by DaiMon Tog.

482
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:38,250
Let's see just how
relaxed DaiMon Tog is.

483
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,542
<i>Mother, we're out of the cell</i>

484
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:42,417
<i>and we're trying</i>
<i>to contact the</i> Enterprise,

485
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,250
<i>but we can't do it</i>
<i>without Tog's access code.</i>

486
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,667
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>you could manage to...</i>

487
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:49,083
LWAXANA:
<i>Say no more, Little One.</i>

488
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:54,041
Lwaxana, you and I are going
to make such a wonderful team.

489
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:58,500
With your telepathy
and my cunning, I foresee...

490
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,667
A very profitable future.

491
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,500
(<i> chuckles in agreement</i> )

492
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:12,125
Subspace interference
is subsiding, sir.

493
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,208
Communications
have been restored.

494
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,375
Good.

495
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,709
Contact Commander Riker
on Betazed.

496
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,792
Message coming in
from Betazed, sir.

497
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,166
Priority one.

498
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:24,375
On screen.

499
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,125
Captain Picard, at last.

500
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,208
We have been trying to reach you
for two days.

501
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,458
Our communications have been
blocked by the nebula, Reittan.

502
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,333
Is there a problem?

503
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,166
I'm afraid so, Captain.

504
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:37,208
Lwaxana, Deanna,
and Commander Riker

505
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,959
have disappeared.

506
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:48,417
I knew I wanted you
the moment I saw you.

507
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:51,458
You have fulfilled
all of my expectations.

508
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:52,709
How sweet.

509
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:55,542
Farek thought
it was a bad idea,

510
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:56,959
but I knew better.

511
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,208
How clever.

512
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,792
I knew best.

513
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,709
I always know best.

514
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:03,834
(<i> low voice</i> ):
How repugnant.

515
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:04,959
What?

516
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,333
Oh, I said, "How romantic."

517
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,125
I can't
resist a man

518
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,959
who knows what he wants
and goes after it.

519
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:15,750
That's me and that's why
I am DaiMon of this ship.

520
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,291
I take charge
in every situation.

521
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,959
More to the left, woman.

522
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,542
Whatever you say.

523
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,792
(<i> moaning happily</i> )

524
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:30,458
My darling, would you care
for something to drink?

525
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:32,583
Mmm. You're so attentive.

526
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:34,542
Does your food
synthesizer

527
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:37,417
know how to make
an Arcturian Fizz?

528
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:39,125
I don't think so.

529
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:42,709
They have certain
pleasure-enhancing qualities.

530
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,291
Hmm.

531
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:47,917
Uh... let me teach
your computer
how to make one.

532
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,959
Oh!

533
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:55,834
I'll need your access code.

534
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:57,875
Yes, my beloved.

535
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:01,333
Computer, access code<i> Keh-ee</i>

536
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,542
<i>Yoor-ee Dah-teh-ee...</i>

537
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,250
Tog, be silent!

538
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:10,041
I knew you were
not to be trusted.

539
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,917
Doctor Farek, I was
just going to make
DaiMon Tog a drink.

540
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:16,208
Save your lies
for this fool.

541
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,542
B-But he's...

542
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:18,834
But, oh, please,
don't listen to him, don't.

543
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:19,834
No, he's misunderstood.

544
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:20,834
No, Tog.

545
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,250
<i>You</i> have
misunderstood.

546
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,083
You have been tricked
by a sly female

547
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,875
who finds you repulsive.

548
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:30,750
She was only trying
to serve me a drink.

549
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,041
You almost gave her

550
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,000
complete access
to the ship's computer--

551
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,750
a security breach
severe enough

552
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,709
to cost you
your command.

553
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,208
It's time you took my advice.

554
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,291
Let me study her.

555
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,291
Study her?

556
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,542
Your mind probes
could kill her.

557
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:52,709
You brought her aboard
for her telepathic powers.

558
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:54,250
If I can determine

559
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,250
what neural configuration
gives her those powers,

560
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,125
I may be able
to duplicate them.

561
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:03,000
We could still profit from this.

562
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,667
I don't know.

563
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:08,500
A true DaiMon would not
be blinded by lust.

564
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,667
Give her to me

565
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:14,125
or I may be forced
to report your transgressions.

566
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:17,291
Very well.

567
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:18,709
Oh...
Take her.

568
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,625
WORF:
When you're finished here,
survey in that direction.

569
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:36,834
Aye, sir.

570
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:45,083
I wish I had some answers
for you, Lieutenant Worf.

571
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,667
Mr. Homn was no help?

572
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:47,834
None. He last saw them

573
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:49,333
as he was leaving
this clearing.

574
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,291
When he returned, all
three of them were gone.

575
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,917
Lieutenant Foley discovered this
in the pond.

576
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,625
The species is Zan Periculi.

577
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:58,834
It is not indigenous to Betazed

578
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:01,375
but to Lappa IV,
a Ferengi world.

579
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,417
Now we have a reasonable
hypothesis as to whom.

580
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,417
The difficult
question is where.

581
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:14,709
The Ferengi ship is almost
as fast as the<i> Enterprise.</i>

582
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:16,458
She could be anywhere by now.

583
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,792
Commander Riker will assume
we'll be searching for them.

584
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,500
He'll find some way
to send us a message.

585
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,542
Mr. Worf,

586
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:22,709
I want continual
monitoring

587
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:24,709
of Ferengi
subspace frequencies.

588
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:26,250
Mr. La Forge, can you extend

589
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,875
our sensor range?

590
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,458
If I narrow the band and tie in
the long-range sensors

591
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,542
to the subspace scanners,
I can boost the gain.

592
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:32,917
Make it so.

593
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,291
Do you wish to leave orbit, sir?

594
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:40,917
Not until we have
some place to go.

595
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

596
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,542
I've done everything I know how.
It's no use.

597
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:53,000
Without Tog's security code,

598
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,250
I can't get near
their communication system.

599
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,917
We're running
out of time.

600
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:59,875
Farek's about to begin
the neural scan on Mother.

601
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:02,667
Maybe I'm going about this
in the wrong way.

602
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:07,041
If I pick a minor subsystem,
something non-essential...

603
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,542
Like this-- warp field
phase adjustment.

604
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:13,959
All this does is suppress
the subspace interference

605
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,375
generated
by the warp engines.

606
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,750
Meaning what?

607
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,750
Meaning, if I set up
a simple oscillation,

608
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,000
I can send out a signal.

609
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,583
The trick is
to create a message

610
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,291
the<i> Enterprise</i> will understand

611
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,834
but the Ferengi will think is
just normal subspace static.

612
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,417
(<i> electronic zapping</i> )

613
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,792
(<i> Lwaxana groaning</i> )

614
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,667
(<i> Lwaxana yells</i> )

615
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:36,542
Oh...

616
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:38,375
What's wrong?

617
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,458
Mother.

618
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:47,542
Will... we have to help her.

619
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,291
Thanks for your help, Wes,

620
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,709
but you'd better get
aboard the<i> Bradbury.</i>

621
00:32:02,709 --> 00:32:04,625
They were ready to break
orbit an hour ago.

622
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,291
As soon as I'm sure
this works.

623
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:12,458
Initiating scans now, Captain.

624
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:17,625
(<i> static hissing and beeping)</i>

625
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,750
Can you locate the<i> Krayton?</i>

626
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,125
Ferengi transmissions

627
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,834
are routinely scrambled
and encoded, sir.

628
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,875
Without breaking the
code, we will be unable

629
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,959
to identify
any specific
Ferengi vessel.

630
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:30,834
Ferengi codes are damn near
impossible to break.

631
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:32,709
Gentlemen, I have
the utmost confidence

632
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,959
in your ability to
perform the impossible.

633
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:37,959
(<i> static popping and beeping)</i>

634
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,417
Captain, the<i> Bradbury</i>
is hailing us.

635
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,458
They can no longer delay
their departure.

636
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:47,667
Mr. Crusher,

637
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,250
now.

638
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,834
No lengthy farewells.

639
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:52,166
Good luck.

640
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,333
Thank you, sir.

641
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:04,834
DATA:
The repetitive nature
of the subcarrier pattern

642
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:07,875
implies a modified
Huffman-Greenlaw encoder
scheme...

643
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:10,625
Deck six.

644
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,083
Wesley.

645
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:21,166
Take care.

646
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,625
You too, Mom.

647
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,166
Something the matter?

648
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:30,709
We've been scanning
Ferengi transmissions

649
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,500
trying to locate the<i> Krayton.</i>

650
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,208
One of the signals was...

651
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,542
I don't know, familiar somehow.

652
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:38,834
Something in the message?

653
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:42,000
No, the message was scrambled.

654
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:45,834
It was the static!

655
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,250
Where are you going?

656
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,709
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

657
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,583
Captain.

658
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,583
The<i> Bradbury</i> has informed us

659
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:03,333
they can no longer wait
for Mr. Crusher to come aboard.

660
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,542
Wesley.

661
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,709
Captain, I think
there's a pattern

662
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:06,959
to the subspace
interference

663
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,291
I heard in one
of the Ferengi messages.

664
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:09,709
Wesley, unless you
leave immediately,

665
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,125
you're going to miss
the<i> Bradbury.</i>

666
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,709
The interference itself
could be a message.

667
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:15,458
If I could just hear a replay
of the subspace scans.

668
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,250
Signal the<i> Bradbury</i>
they may leave.

669
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,500
Play back
the Ferengi transmissions.

670
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,000
(<i> static hissing and popping)</i>

671
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,750
Wait, repeat that one.

672
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,667
Put it on continuous replay.

673
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:33,792
Hear that popping noise?

674
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:36,375
Data, can you filter out
everything but that sound?

675
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,291
(<i> popping, rhythmic beeps</i> )

676
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:40,208
That's Cochrane distortion--

677
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,208
a fluctuation in the phase
of the subspace field.

678
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,959
All warp engines generate
that kind of interference.

679
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,834
But listen to the pattern.

680
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,750
It's the Algolian
ceremonial rhythm

681
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,041
that the musician played
at the reception.

682
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,667
Mr. Crusher
is correct, sir.

683
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,417
There is a temporal
correlation.

684
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:58,625
Then it is a signal
from Commander Riker.

685
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,875
Ingenious.

686
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:02,458
He selected a signal
we'd recognize

687
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,917
but one the Ferengi
would dismiss as static.

688
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:09,542
(<i> console beeping</i> )

689
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,917
WORF:
Signal source located, Captain.

690
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:12,500
Plot an intercept course.

691
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,667
Course plotted and laid in,
sir.

692
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:15,709
Well done, Mr. Crusher.

693
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:16,709
Warp eight.

694
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:17,959
Aye, sir.

695
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,291
Engage.

696
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:24,041
(<i> groaning loudly</i> )

697
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,291
Get away from her.

698
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,709
What do you think
you're doing?

699
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:31,875
Standoff, Commander.

700
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:40,709
DaiMon Tog, can't we
strike a bargain?

701
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:43,291
All I am concerned about

702
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,750
is my daughter's safety.

703
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,917
What happens to me
isn't important.

704
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,792
What are you suggesting?

705
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:51,417
Well, let me be candid,
DaiMon Tog.

706
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:52,583
Deanna's of no use to you.

707
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,125
She's only
half Betazoid.

708
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,542
And if you keep Riker,

709
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:57,875
Starfleet will never stop
chasing you.

710
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,875
Release them.

711
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:03,417
Release them and I will stay
with you willingly.

712
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,083
I'll even use
my telepathy

713
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,959
to aid in your negotiations.

714
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:09,542
A tempting offer.

715
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,166
I would like to believe you.

716
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,625
The offer is genuine.

717
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:18,709
I give you my word as a daughter
of the Fifth House of Betazed.

718
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:19,917
Lwaxana, don't.

719
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:21,250
I've made up my mind.

720
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,583
I can't let you do this.

721
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,125
William, I am a grown woman.

722
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,875
I can make my own decisions.

723
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:28,125
Mother, we can't
just leave you here.

724
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:29,458
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

725
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:32,333
<i>And before he</i>
<i>changes his mind.</i>

726
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:36,333
Please, Little One,
do this for me.

727
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,667
Just this once.

728
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,542
Do we have an agreement?

729
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,583
I give you my word.

730
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,667
I will release your daughter
and the Commander.

731
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:04,625
CREWMAN:
DaiMon, a Federation ship
approaching at high warp.

732
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,625
The<i> Enterprise</i> has found us.

733
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,834
Slow to impulse.

734
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:10,792
Raise shields.

735
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:14,000
Inform the<i> Enterprise</i>
that two of our guests

736
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,500
are ready to return.

737
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
The other will be
staying with us

738
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,166
at her own request.

739
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:21,166
I must protest, DaiMon.

740
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,583
Lwaxana has given her word.

741
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,709
<i>Oo-mox</i> is only the beginning.

742
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,834
Are you both all right?

743
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:01,667
None the worse for wear.

744
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:03,667
My mother bought
our freedom, Captain.

745
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,667
She doesn't want
to stay with Tog.

746
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,041
Hail the<i> Krayton.</i>

747
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:13,875
Frequencies open.
DaiMon Tog responding.

748
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,458
On screen.

749
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:19,166
Captain Picard, so good of you
to meet us.

750
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:23,917
We were on our way to Betazed
to return our guests.

751
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,834
Of course you were, DaiMon.

752
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:28,542
But you're still holding
Lwaxana Troi.

753
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:32,792
When will you get it
through your thick head

754
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:34,959
that it's over
between us, Jean-Luc?

755
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:40,250
I think I know
what she's doing.

756
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,458
You have to fight

757
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,625
to get her
back, Captain.

758
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,625
Open.

759
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:56,583
Um, uh, uh... it's not over
between us, Lwaxana.

760
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:59,083
Um, uh...
you're mine and, um...

761
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,750
I-I will not let you go.

762
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,375
I-I insist you
return to my side

763
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,458
immediately.

764
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,166
You mean, you
still care?

765
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:15,458
"My love is a fever,
longing still for that

766
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:18,166
which longer nurseth
the disease."

767
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,667
Tell me more.

768
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:24,667
"In faith, I do not love thee
with mine eyes,

769
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:28,041
"for they in thee
a thousand errors see,

770
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:33,166
"But 'tis my heart
that loves what they despise,

771
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:36,667
"Who, in despite of view,
art pleas'd to dote.

772
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:40,333
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

773
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,583
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate..."

774
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:46,000
You didn't tell me that you
and Captain Picard were...

775
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,709
You said you didn't
want to hear about
my other romances.

776
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:51,792
I have a new love, Jean-Luc.

777
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:53,208
And you can't

778
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:54,542
keep killing all my lovers.

779
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:55,750
Now, that simply has to stop.

780
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,375
Killing?

781
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,834
Oh, he's insanely jealous.

782
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,709
Listen, Tog,
I must possess Lwaxana,

783
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:03,709
and if that means destroying
your ship in the process,

784
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:04,959
so be it.

785
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:07,834
Captain, I had
no idea Lwaxa...

786
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:09,917
Don't let him
threaten you.

787
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,458
You can defeat him.

788
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:14,250
The only way you'll
ever get me back

789
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,250
is over Tog's dead body.

790
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,875
That can be arranged.

791
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:21,041
Mr. Worf, arm phaser banks
and photon torpedoes.

792
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:24,458
If Lwaxana Troi is not
in my arms in ten seconds,

793
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:27,542
throw everything you've got
at the<i> Krayton.</i>

794
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:29,750
But you will destroy Lwaxana.

795
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,208
"When I have pluck'd the rose,

796
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,583
"I cannot give it
vital growth again.

797
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:37,625
It needs must wither."

798
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:39,875
Nine, eight...

799
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:43,000
"'Tis better to have loved
and lost

800
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,250
than never to have loved
at all."

801
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,208
Seven... six...

802
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:49,417
No, wait.

803
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:51,375
Five... four...

804
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,500
Beam her to their Bridge now.

805
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,417
Two... one...

806
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:08,250
You wonderfully
jealous fool, you.

807
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,000
TOG:
Captain...

808
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,166
I-I trust there will be
no further action

809
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:13,792
taken against us?

810
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:16,041
Such as my reporting this
incident to your superiors

811
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,959
who may question
your competence as DaiMon?

812
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,083
I will think about it.

813
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,542
Screen off.

814
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,792
Thank you, Jean-Luc.

815
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:26,041
You were most convincing.

816
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:28,333
You certainly
convinced me.

817
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,500
I am truly grateful,
Mrs. Troi,

818
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,542
that you risked your life
to save my people.

819
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,417
I'll have you home
in a few hours.

820
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:36,500
Oh, no, no, no, no.

821
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,625
That won't be necessary.

822
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,041
I'd just love
to hear more

823
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,375
of your poetry.

824
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,458
Ah...

825
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:42,959
Perhaps another time.

826
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:46,000
Please.

827
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,834
Mr. Crusher.

828
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:51,542
Set course for Betazed.

829
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,417
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Warp nine.

830
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,166
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come.

831
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,000
You wanted to see me, Captain?

832
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,542
I've been in touch with Admiral
Hahn at Starfleet Academy.

833
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:12,500
He regrets your missing
the oral examination

834
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,917
but hopes that you will
reapply next year.

835
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:16,834
I understand, sir.

836
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,542
And I do intend to reapply.

837
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:22,750
In the interim,
the Academy's loss is our gain.

838
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,083
The<i> Enterprise</i>

839
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,291
will continue to benefit

840
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:26,709
from your talents
for another year.

841
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:28,041
Thank you, sir.

842
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:31,375
(<i> inhales deeply</i> )

843
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,625
Is that all?

844
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:37,500
No.

845
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,041
Is there something wrong,
Captain?

846
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,792
I'm just thinking that...

847
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:48,208
I'm saying good-bye to you
as you are today.

848
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:51,250
But I thought you said I
wasn't going to be able to go.

849
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:54,792
The Academy must make you wait,
that's true.

850
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:59,667
But when I review your service
to this ship, your crew mates,

851
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:01,875
I cannot in all conscience

852
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,792
make you wait
for the Academy.

853
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:07,208
You see, Wesley...

854
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:13,083
in my eyes, you're an
acting Ensign in title only.

855
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:17,750
I hereby grant you
field promotion to full Ensign

856
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,125
with all the commensurate
responsibilities

857
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:22,166
and privileges
of that rank.

858
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,458
Congratulations.

859
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,792
You're dismissed.

860
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:45,166
Lwaxana Troi has beamed down
to Betazed, Captain.

861
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:48,125
Notify Starfleet we are en route
to the Xanthras system

862
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,417
for our rendezvous
with the<i> Zapata.</i>

863
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:51,667
Aye, sir.

864
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,750
Ensign Crusher,
take us out of orbit.

865
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,166
Set a course for Xanthras III.

866
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:16,750
Warp factor six.

867
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,750
Aye, sir.

868
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,709
Course is set.

869
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,333
Engage.
