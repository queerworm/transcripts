<i>Dear Commander Maddox</i>

<i>in reference</i>

<i>with particular emphasis on</i>

12
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,375
Commander Riker,
you are 15 minutes early.

13
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:39,834
Well, it's a very special day.

14
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,875
I thought the father
of the bride would enjoy

15
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,667
being relieved early
on the wedding day.

16
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:44,792
Thank you, sir.

17
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:45,792
Nervous?

18
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,417
I cannot become nervous, sir.

19
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,041
However, I do sense
a certain... anticipation

20
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,250
regarding my role
in the wedding.

21
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,917
Anything to report?

22
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,959
All systems are normal, sir.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,375
Sick Bay reports
that Lieutenant Juarez
went into labor at 0400.

24
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:03,250
We remain at station
awaiting the arrival
of Starship<i> Zhukov</i>

25
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,375
and guest quarters
have been prepared
for Ambassador T'Pel.

26
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:06,375
Thank you.

27
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,417
I have the Bridge.

28
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,750
Aye, sir.

29
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:11,041
Begin day watch.

DATA:
<i>Initially, Commander Maddox</i>

31
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,458
<i>I found it difficult</i>
<i>to maintain friendships</i>

32
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
<i>since human emotions</i>
<i>are often puzzling to me.</i>

33
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,834
<i>Eventually,</i>
<i>I developed a program</i>

34
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:28,166
<i>enabling me to predict</i>
<i>human emotional responses</i>

35
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,709
<i>to specific actions.</i>

37
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,709
Come in.

38
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:39,917
It is time for the
wedding rehearsal.

39
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,458
I know.

40
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,834
Data, I've decided
not to go through with it.

41
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,959
You do not wish to rehearse?

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,792
No, I'm calling off the wedding.

43
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,750
May I ask why?

44
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:54,667
It's just the right thing to do.

45
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:58,417
Have your feelings
for Chief O'Brien changed?

46
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:05,667
I'm supposed
to be getting married, Data.

47
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,333
I should be happy, but I'm not.

48
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,667
I just feel this weight

49
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:10,417
pressing down on me.

50
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,291
Will canceling the wedding
make you happy?

51
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,834
Yes.

52
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,917
He'll probably
be just as relieved as I am.

53
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,875
Data

54
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,291
you introduced us to each other.

55
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,750
You mean a lot to both of us.

56
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:28,875
I would really appreciate it

57
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:31,750
if you would talk to Miles
for me.

58
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,583
If you wish.

59
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,834
<i>My friend Chief O'Brien</i>
<i>often says</i>

60
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,834
<i>that above all else,</i>
<i>he wants to make Keiko happy.</i>

61
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,125

<i>will make her happy</i>

62
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,000
<i>I must conclude the Chief will</i>
<i>be pleased at her decision.</i>

63
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,291
I have good news.

64
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,875
Oh?

65
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:57,625
Keiko has made a decision

66
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:00,166
designed to increase
her happiness.

67
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,041
She has canceled the wedding.

68
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,917
She what?

69
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,500
Canceled the wedding?!

70
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:08,166
Today?

71
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,834
Without even a word?

72
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:14,750
Of all the childish, selfish,
irresponsible things to do!

73
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:18,917
Next time, maybe I should
deliver the good news.

74

Welcome aboard the<i> Enterprise,</i>

95
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,959
I would meet
with your Captain.

96
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:03,583
<i>Since I am not affected</i>
<i>by emotional considerations</i>

97
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,000
<i>I am closer to being Vulcan</i>
<i>than human.</i>

98
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,792
<i>However, while their devotion</i>
<i>to logic</i>

99

<i>does have a certain appeal</i>

100
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:13,917
<i>I find their stark philosophy</i>
<i>to be somewhat... limited.</i>

101

105
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,792
Your service honors us.

106

This is my First Officer,
Commander William Riker.

107
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,291
Leave us, please.

108
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,166
<i>Charming</i> woman.

109
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,792
<i>The tone</i>
<i>of Commander Riker's voice</i>

110
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,917
<i>makes me suspect</i>
<i>that he is not serious</i>

111
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,333
<i>about finding</i>
<i>Ambassador T'Pel charming.</i>

112
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,542
<i>My experience suggests</i>
<i>that, in fact, he may mean</i>

113
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,917
<i>the exact opposite</i>
<i>of what he says.</i>

114
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,458
<i>Irony is a form of expression</i>

You don't need
a haircut.

117
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,166
You were just
in here last week.

118
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,083
Hey, if you'd done it
right the first time

119
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,792
I wouldn't need to be
back here so soon.

120
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,959
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
I know you want
to look beautiful

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,959
but I'm just a barber,
not a miracle worker.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Just try to keep my ears
on straight today, all right?

123
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,000
<i>Friendly insults and jibes--</i>

124
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,000
<i>another form of human speech</i>
<i>that I am attempting to</i>
<i>master.</i>

125

<i>In this case, with the help</i>
<i>of Commander Geordi La Forge.</i>

126

Hi, Data.

127
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,834
<i>I consider Geordi</i>

128
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,458
Here for a trim?

129
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,458
My hair does not require
trimming, you lunkhead.

130
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,041
What?

131
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,500
My hair does not require
trimming...

132
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,000
Lunkhead?

133
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,792
I am experimenting
with friendly jibes and insults.

134
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,083
It was not meant
as a serious disparagement.

135
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,709
(<i> chuckles</i> )

136
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,583
Well... just don't try it
on the Captain.

137
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,959
No.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,166
Geordi, I am still confused

139
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,583
by Chief O'Brien's reaction
this morning.

140
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,125
Mm, yeah.

141
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,709
He was just surprised, Data.

142
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,875
He didn't mean
to blow up like that.

143
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:55,375
He knows that Keiko

144
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,667
probably doesn't want
to call off the marriage.

145
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,583
She's just getting cold feet.

146
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,000
(<i> instrument humming</i> )

147
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,792
Cold feet?

148
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:03,792
Jitters.

149
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,041
A nervous reaction

150
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,500
to an impending event
of great importance.

151
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,542
Right.
Don't worry.

152
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,208
Everything's
going to be fine.

153
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,959
She'll change her mind again.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,208
She will?

155
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,000
Absolutely.

156
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,917
So, you believe that
the marriage will still proceed?

157
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,625
Trust me.

158
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,291
They're going to get married,
so you'd better find a gift.

159
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,834
<i>I find Lieutenant Worf</i>

160
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,083
<i>to be what is called</i>
<i>a kindred spirit.</i>

161
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,208
<i>We were both orphans</i>
<i>rescued by Starfleet officers.</i>

162
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,542
<i>In many ways, we are both still</i>
<i>outsiders in human society.</i>

163
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:42,166
Are you here
to find a wedding gift?
Yes.

164
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,750
I would appreciate
your help in selecting
an appropriate item.

165
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,375
Of course.

166
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,834
I have attended human
weddings before.

167
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,917
WORF:
Hold.

168
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,667

This is a
traditional gift?

at family weddings.

171
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,208
A human custom.

172
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,041
WORF:
Hold.

173
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,750
It is my understanding
that the item selected

174
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:17,625
should reflect the personality
of whoever is giving it.

175
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,959
This does not
remind me of you.

176
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,542
Have you ever been
an actual participant

177
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,792
in a human wedding?

178
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:27,625
No.

179
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,625
You would not consider it
to be an honor?

180
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,667
An honor, perhaps

181
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,875
but human
bonding rituals

182
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:38,291
often involve a
great deal of talking

183
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,583
and dancing and...

184
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,625
crying.

185
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,583
Dancing?

186
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,417
<i>I am rarely in need</i>

187
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,959
<i>of Dr. Beverly Crusher's</i>
<i>professional services</i>

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,750

189
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,500
<i>is self-sufficient</i>

190
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,709

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,041
<i>and have learned a great deal</i>

192
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,291
<i>about human interaction</i>
<i>from her.</i>

193
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,208
Doctor, may I ask
a favor of you?

194
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,375
Of course, Data.

195
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,875
Would you teach
me to dance?

196
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,583
What?!

197
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,417
I would like to learn
how to dance.

198
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,417
Why me?

199
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,208
It was in your service record--

200
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,458
"Awarded first prize, tap and
jazz competition, St. Louis..."

201
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,375
Okay, okay.

202
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:25,375
Have I said something
to upset you?

203
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:29,417
It's just that... that
was a long time ago

204
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,625
and I don't want to be known
as "The Dancing Doctor..."

205
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,333
again.

206
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,792
Then your answer is no.

207
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:40,166
All right, but...

208
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:44,125
let's keep this
between you and me.

209
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,959
Of course, Doctor.

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,250
PICARD:
Commander Data,
please report to the Bridge.

211
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,709
Acknowledged.

212
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:55,500
(<i> door opens</i> )

213
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:58,083
Data, I want a tactical
projection of possible

214
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,291
Romulan deployments
along the Neutral Zone.

215
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,750
Access all Federation
records on the subject

216
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,375
and report
to my ready room.

217
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:07,709
Captain, is there a specific
area you wish me to study?

218
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:13,208
No.
Ambassador.

219
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,125
Number One, set a course
130 mark 246, warp seven.

220
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,458
That will take us very close
to the Neutral Zone, Captain.

221
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,625
I'm aware of
that, Number One.
Proceed.

222
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,375
Lay in the course.

223
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,041
<i>It is fortunate that I am</i>
<i>able to perform my duties</i>

224
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,250
<i>without emotional distractions.</i>

225
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,959
<i>If that were not the case</i>

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,375
<i>a sudden course correction</i>
<i>toward the Neutral Zone</i>

227
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:44,750
<i>would make me very...</i>
<i>nervous.</i>

228
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,709
Mr. Data, based

229
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,875
on your analysis

230
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,917
what is the current
Romulan strategy

231
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,333
behind the deployment
of their ships in this sector?

232
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,875
Their ships are deployed

233
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:05,750
to support a policy of
confrontation designed to test

234
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,041
Federation defenses
along the Neutral Zone.

235
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,083
Do you predict any change
in the near future?

236
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,208
I predict a 90% probability

237
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,125
that they will continue
to support that policy.

238
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,542
And is there any indication

239
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,333
of a more conciliatory attitude
on their part?

240
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,125
No, sir.

241
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,250
Caution is clearly called for,
Captain.

242
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,834
However, the mission
must proceed as planned.

243
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:30,667
Starfleet Command
agrees with you

244
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,709
but I would feel better if you
would consent to an escort

245
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,375
or a...

246
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,375
Thank you, Mr. Data.

247
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:58,291
Feline supplement... 74.

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,792

249
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,417

COMPUTER:
Diagnostic complete.

253
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,208
All systems functioning
within normal parameters.

254
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,417
(<i> door chimes</i> )

255
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,792
Come in.

256
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,959
Am I intruding,
Commander?

257
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No.

258
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,041
Would you care to sit down?

259
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,917
<i>When one of my friends</i>
<i>is distraught, I have learned</i>

260
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,542
<i>that the thoughtful thing to do</i>

261
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,625
<i>is to attempt to make him</i>
<i>feel more comfortable.</i>

262
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,917
May I offer you some
refreshment, Chief?

263
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:09,041
No, thank you, sir.

264
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,625
First of all,
I'd like to apologize

265
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,333
for this morning in Ten-Forward.

266
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,417
There is no need to apologize.

267
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,000
I was not offended.

268
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,375
Would you like a pillow

269
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:20,834
or a more comfortable
chair to sit upon?

270
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,458
No, sir.

271
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,917
Thank you, sir.

272
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,250
Perhaps you would
like some music?

273
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,875
Brahms? Aurelia?

274
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,417
No, really, sir, I'm fine.

275
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:36,208
I came to ask for your help.

276
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,083
It's about Keiko.

277
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,542
I'd like you to talk to her--

278
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,000
convince her to go through
with the wedding.

279
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,250
Would Counselor Troi not be
a more appropriate choice

280
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,333
to speak with Keiko?

281
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,709
She already has.

282
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,208
Didn't help.

283
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,208
You've known her longer
than I have.

284
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,542
I just thought
she might listen to you.

285
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,458
She won't even talk to me.

286
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,583
I do not know
what to say to her.

287
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,875
Just talk with her--
make her see reason.

288
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:05,709
She's going off half-cocked,
not thinking this through.

289
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,583
You've worked with her
for a long time.

290
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,667
She respects your opinion.

291
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,166
Perhaps...

292
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:29,750
Perhaps she has not
fully analyzed her decision.

293
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:31,291
I will try.

294
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,166
Thank you, sir.

295
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,166
I won't forget this.

296
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,917
<i>Commander Maddox,</i>
<i>I noted that Keiko</i>

297
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,583
<i>was quite calm and rational</i>

298
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,208
<i>when she informed me</i>
<i>of her decision this morning.</i>

299
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,291
<i>Therefore, I can predict</i>
<i>that she will respond</i>

300
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,667
<i>to an objective analysis</i>
<i>of the situation</i>

301
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,041
<i>based on the available facts.</i>

302
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,834
<i>It is fortunate</i>
<i>that she has not</i>

303
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,291
<i>let emotional considerations</i>
<i>cloud her judgment.</i>

304
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,041
<i>It should make my task</i>
<i>much simpler.</i>

305
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,041
What?

306
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,333
I believe you have made

307
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,125
an incorrect analysis
of the facts at hand.

308
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,583
What do you mean?

309
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,959
You do not seem happy.

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,625
Well...

311
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,417
Your decision was based
on the assumption

312
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,125
that canceling the wedding
would make you happy.

313
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,834
This has proven
to be incorrect.

314
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,625
Data, it's not that simple.

315
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:20,959
Since your actions

316
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,625
did not produce
the desired result

317
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,166
the only advisable solution
would be to reexamine

318
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,458
your decision-making process

319
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,667
and look for errors.

320
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,125
I knew what I was doing.

321
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,125
It's my decision.

322
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,709
That fact is not in dispute.

323
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,083
However, you may have
acted with undue haste

324
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:39,000
and in doing so,
unintentionally hurt
Chief O'Brien's feelings.

325
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,458
I did what I had to!

326
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,125
Why are you doing this?

327
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,834
I thought you
were my friend.

328
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,041
I am your friend.

329
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,834
Then leave me alone.

330
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,458
If I have offended...

331
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,166
Just leave me alone!

332
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:55,000
<i>It is clear</i>
<i>that I need guidance</i>

333
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,917
<i>to resolve this situation.</i>

334
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,709
<i>Counselor Troi's advice</i>
<i>should be useful.</i>

335
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,750
<i>In many ways, Deanna Troi</i>

336
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,750
<i>is the friend</i>
<i>I understand the least.</i>

337
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:06,625
<i>Her life and her duties</i>
<i>are predicated</i>

338
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:09,375
<i>on her understanding</i>
<i>and perception of emotions.</i>

339
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,667
<i>Since I have none,</i>
<i>no doubt she finds me</i>

340
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:15,083
<i>as much a mystery</i>
<i>as I find her.</i>

341
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,166
Chief O'Brien
talks to me.

342
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,166
Keiko talks to you.

343
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,208
Why do they not talk
to each other?

344
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,291
That's a good question, Data.

345
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,083
I wish I had
a good answer for you.

346
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,000
Perhaps, when they're ready,
they will.

347
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,667
Hmm.

348
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:33,959
Many aspects of this situation
are puzzling to me.

349
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,083
I have been studying
various texts

350
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,542
on the subject of marriage

351
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,625
but I have not found
a suitable guide.

352
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,583
A suitable guide for what?

353
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:45,333
In an effort to be helpful,
I am attempting to calculate

354
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,792
the variables involved
in a successful marriage.

355
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,917
Good luck.

356
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,959
There are
many opinions.

357
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,500
On Galvin V, a marriage
is considered successful

358
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,667
only if children are produced
within a year of the marriage.

359
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:03,250
Andorian marriages require
groups of four, unless...

360
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,750
Data, would you like my advice
on how to help them?

361
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,583
Don't.

362
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,333
This is something they have
to work out for themselves.

363
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,875
But... I am their friend.

364
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:18,083
Should I not stand with them
in a time of difficulty?

365
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,834
There are many ways
to help a friend

366
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,834
and sometimes the best way
is to leave them alone.

367
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,834
Do you believe it
to be the correct decision

368
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:29,875
for them to marry?

369
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,709
I don't know.

370
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,500
They're very much in love,
but sometimes that isn't enough.

371
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:36,834
Marriage is an agreement

372
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,542
to share who you are
with someone else

373
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,667
to spend your lives together,
to grow old together.

374
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:44,917
"To grow old together"?

375
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,709
That is an integral component
of marriage?

376
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,500
Usually.
Why do you ask?

377
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:52,000
Although I am an android

378
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,291
I have not excluded
the possibility

379
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,458
that I, too, may someday marry.

380
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,208
Data, I had no idea

381
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,125
you'd thought
about getting married.

382
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,333
I believe I have much
to offer a potential mate

383
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,333
however, we cannot
grow old together because...

384
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,625
I will not grow old.

385
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,458
Data...

386
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:18,375
you do have
a lot to offer.

387
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:21,667
Commander Data,
this is Ambassador T'Pel.

388
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:23,542
Please report to my quarters.

389
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,875
Acknowledged.

390
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,250
(<i> door chimes</i> )

391
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,667
Enter.

392
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,750
You have
priority three clearance

393
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:43,083
aboard the<i> Enterprise?</i>

394
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,709
That is correct,
Ambassador.

395
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,500
I require information

396
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:49,709
on the ship's defense
and navigational systems.

397
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,083
Access code kappa alpha 4601704.

398
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,959
The code is valid.

399
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,750
What is the field strength
of this ship's deflector shields

400
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,417
at maximum output?

401
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,166
May I ask the purpose
of your request?

402
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,834
I require
this information.

403
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,792
I have the same
safeguards

404
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,166
as the ship's computer.

405
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,083
Therefore, I must
report any inquiry

406
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,750
regarding restricted
information

407
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:16,667
to the Captain.

408
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:20,625
Your reaction suggests
you do not wish the Captain

409
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,166
to be informed of your inquiry.

410
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,333
I was not interested
in the information.

411
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,125
I was curious
as to your security safeguards.

412
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,041
They appear to be adequate.

413
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,333
Cancel the request.

414
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,625
You may leave.

415
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,750
<i>Commander Maddox, I have</i>
<i>often wished for the sense</i>

416
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,709
<i>that humans</i>
<i>call intuition or instinct.</i>

422
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,041
Hi, Data.

(<i> shoes tapping</i> )

424
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:20,500
Well, what do you think?

425
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:22,166
It is a re-creation
of the studio

426
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,959
I had my first
dance lesson in.

427
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,917
It appears to be

428
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,667
quite suitable, Doctor.

429
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:29,625
Let's start
with something simple.

430
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,500
Stomp... hop.

431
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:32,583
Try it.

432
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,709
(<i> shoes tapping</i> )

433
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,709
Again.

434
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,208
Good.

435
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,417
Good!

436
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,625
Am I dancing, Doctor?

437
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:41,834
Not quite.

438
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,458
Stop, Data.

439
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,166
Now try this.

440
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,959
Doctor, perhaps

441
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,542
it would be beneficial
to teach me the final lesson.

442
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,625
Okay.

443
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,166
(<i> complicated tap rhythm</i> )

444
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,000
That's great.

445
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,375
Watch.

446
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,417
Good.

447
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,792
Triples.

448
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,667
Watch.

449
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,250
Stop, Data.

450
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:29,875
And you say you've
never done this before?

451
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,667
Try this.

452
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:35,667
(<i> rapid tap rhythm</i> )

453
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,375
Stop, Data!

454
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,375
Not bad.

455
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:16,333
Yeah, not bad.

456
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,417
Then I have successfully
learned to dance?

457
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,375
I'd say you've
picked up the basics.

458
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:22,667
Thank you, Doctor.

459
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,792
I am now prepared
to dance at the wedding.

460
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:25,792
Wedding?

461
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,333
Keiko's wedding.

462
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:31,875
Data, you never told me
this was for the wedding.

463
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,125
Is that important?

464
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,500
Well, yes.

465
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:37,792
They don't do a lot
of tap dancing at weddings.

466
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:38,917
Why?

467
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,709
Well, Data, because...

468
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,208
I don't really
know why, Data.

469
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,000
Look, why don't I
just teach you

470
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,667
a style of dancing
that they<i> will</i> do

471
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:49,500

Now, compared
to what we've just done

476
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,458
this will be simple.

477
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,417

and follow me.

No, Data, wait a minute.

Ow! No, no, you're just
moving... move slowly.

484
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,875
You picked up
the tap dancing so quickly.

00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,750
I cannot reproduce
your performance

486
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,333
if I cannot
see your feet.

487
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,709
All right.

488
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,667
Well, let's try it again

489
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:33,917
and this time,
watch my feet.

490
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,750
Computer, start music.

491
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:39,709

And...

492
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:46,083
Now, don't just imitate me.

493
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,792
You've got to lead.

494
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,500
Lead where, Doctor?

495
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:52,250
Well, indicate to your partner
where you want her to step.

496
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:57,500
And how is that
accomplished?

497
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:58,875
I'll show you.

498
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:00,375
<i>I'll</i> lead.

499
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:07,041
Now you'll notice that
I don't just repeat

500
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,000
the same pattern over and over.

501
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,792
I improvise.

502
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,875
Now you lead.

503
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,709
That's good.

504
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,917
Now look up, Data.

505
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:24,041
Look into my eyes.

506
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,083
You're holding me too tight.

507
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,083
This is a very complex
set of variables

508
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,333
to coordinate, Doctor.

509
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,083
You are doing fine.

510
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,917
Now, smile.

511
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:37,917

program up an artificial

And don't be afraid
to experiment.

All stop.

537
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,917
Aye, sir.

538
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:14,083
DATA:
Sir, we have reached
the designated coordinates.

539
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,667
Hold this position.

540
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:17,458
Long range scan.

541
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,750
Captain, I am
detecting a ship

542
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:20,917
in the Neutral Zone.

543
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:22,500
Configuration...

544
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:25,458
Romulan warbird.

545
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,750
Yellow Alert.

546
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:32,125
Hail the warbird,
Mr. Worf.

547
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,417
Aye, sir.

548
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,458
They are responding.

549
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,291
Text only.

550
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,166
We are to proceed

551
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:41,709
to the agreed
coordinates.

552
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:48,500
Set course 037 mark 005,
warp four.

553
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,917
Take us into the Neutral Zone,
Ensign.

554
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,875
Captain, the warbird
is holding position.

555
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:03,750
In three minutes, we will be
within phaser range.

556
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:04,792
Red Alert.

557
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,458
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

558
00:28:07,709 --> 00:28:09,834
I trust my crew, Ambassador.

559
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,917
They will take
no provocative action

560
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,875
unless I order them.

561
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,333
Hold position

562
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,709
on these coordinates.

563
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,333
Slow to half impulse.

564
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,375
Open a channel.

565
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:25,041
Open.

566
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,917
I am Ambassador T'Pel.

567
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,500
I am Admiral Mendak.

568
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,083
There is no
established protocol

569
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:35,208
for a meeting of this nature.

570
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,375
The logical course
is that I transport

571
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,834
aboard your ship and
begin the negotiations.

572
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:41,250
Yes.

573
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:45,208
Captain, I note
your defensive systems

574
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,709
have been activated.

575
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,041
As have yours.

576
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,125
It was not meant
as an accusation.

577
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:53,333
Indeed, I salute
your show of strength.

578
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:56,667
Ambassador, we are honored
by your presence.

579
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:59,917
You may transport aboard
at your convenience.

580
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,625
The honor is mine.

581
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,041
Have your transporter room
stand by.

582
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,959
I will beam
aboard their ship

583
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,583
with no further delay.

584
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:13,208
Ambassador, I urge you
once more to reconsider.

585
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,208
The<i> Enterprise</i> can
accommodate a
Romulan delegation

586
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,917
without sacrificing
our security or...

587
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:21,291
Captain Picard, I find
your argument illogical.

588
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,417
Please carry out
my instructions.

589
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:28,709
Picard to Chief O'Brien.

590
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,667
O'Brien here.

591
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:33,583
Prepare to transport
Ambassador T'Pel to
the Romulan vessel.

592
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,208
Aye, sir.

593
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,667
Mr. Worf, maintain
a lock on her signal
once she's aboard.

594
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,000
At the first sign of
trouble, I want to be
able to bring her back.

595
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:41,709
Understood.

596
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:45,834
Transporter activated.

597
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,083
(<i> console beeping insistently)</i>

598
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,208
Captain...

599
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,250
O'BRIEN:
Transporter emergency!

600
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:51,250
I'm losing her signal.

601
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,083
Boosting power
to autosequencers.

602
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,000
Engaging computer override.

603
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,542
O'Brien, what happened
down there?

604
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:58,250
I'm losing the pattern.

605
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,583
Trying to reestablish.

606
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,875
I'm sorry, sir.

607
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:07,333
I wasn't able
to retrieve the signal.

608
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,875
The Ambassador is dead.

609
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:18,291
DATA:
<i>Second Officer's Personal Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

610
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:21,291
<i>The risks aboard a starship</i>
<i>are accepted by all who serve</i>

611
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,166
<i>but I have never failed</i>
<i>to observe</i>

612
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:26,125
<i>a deep emotional response</i>
<i>to the loss of a comrade.</i>

613
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,917
<i>It is at times like this</i>

614
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,834
<i>that I greatly miss the ability</i>
<i>to share human feelings.</i>

615
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:33,166
The signal lock
wasn't broken, sir.

616
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,083
I had just entered
the transfer sequence

617
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,583
when the Ambassador's
pattern began to break up.

618
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:40,208
I tried to switch to
emergency manual control

619
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,542
but the pattern
deteriorated too
quickly and...

620
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:46,583
Captain, there is no prior
record of this type of accident

621
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,500
occurring aboard a starship.

622
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:49,959
Backup systems and safeguards

623
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,333
are designed to prevent
just such an occurrence.

624
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:55,750
I can't find any system flaws
in the unit, Captain.

625
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:57,375
The engineering status
reports were all normal

626
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:58,875
none of the backups
were activated

627
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:01,458
and the autosequencers were
all functioning normally.

628
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Any prior malfunctions
on this transporter unit?
No, sir.

629
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,959
In fact, we replaced
the transition coil
only last week.

630
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,166
Could there have been
some sort of

631
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:09,417
interference
from the Romulans?

632
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,667
Nothing that I could see.

633
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:11,834
The shields were down.

634
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,041
There was no power
interruption

635
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,625
no subspace bias.

636
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:16,750
I want this unit pulled
and its systems checked again

637
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,041
and I want a level-one
diagnostic on all transporters.

638
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,000
Yes, sir.

639
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,333
Her molecular structure

640
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,875
dissipated instantly
once the pattern was lost.

641
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,291
There were some organic
compounds left on the pad

642
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,709
but there wasn't enough
material to do an autopsy.

643
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,792
To die...

644
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:40,083
on a transporter.

645
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,667
Hardly a fitting end

646
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:44,166
for one of the Federation's
most honored diplomats.

647
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,208
WORF:
Bridge to Captain Picard.

648
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,709
Admiral Mendak is hailing.

649
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,333
He wishes to speak with you.

650
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,208
(<i> sighs</i> )

651
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,625
We're still waiting, Captain.

652
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,208
Is there a problem?

653
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,917
PICARD:
There's been an accident.

654
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:04,000
Ambassador T'Pel has been killed
in a transporter malfunction.

655
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:06,625
What kind of malfunction?

656
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,083
We are still investigating that.
As soon as...

657
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,750
I should have known
the Federation

658
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:12,875
wasn't serious
about this conference.

659
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:14,417
Admiral, I assure you

660
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:17,291
the Federation
places the highest priority

661
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,291
on this mission and its goal.

662
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,750
Well played, Captain.

663
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:22,250
Well played.

664
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:25,083
Starfleet opposes
normalization of relations

665
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:26,583
with the Romulan Empire

666
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:30,917
and so you are ordered
to create... an "accident."

667
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,166
You are mistaken.

668
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,834
I am ready and willing

669
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:37,417
to discuss the establishment
of full diplomatic relations

670
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:40,291
under the same terms
as Ambassador T'Pel.

671
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,542
A generous offer, since you know

672
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:45,792
that we were willing
to negotiate only with T'Pel.

673
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:47,834
I salute you again, Captain.

674
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:51,125
It was a maneuver
worthy of a Romulan.

675
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:54,125
I suggest we both
leave the Neutral Zone

676
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:58,125
before there
is another... "accident."

677
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,083
Set course
for Federation territory.

678
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,583
Warp two.

679
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,250
Engage.

680
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:09,375
Mr. Data, I want you to take
charge of this investigation.

681
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:13,083
Study computer logs,
sensor information, everything.

682
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:16,125
I refuse to believe that this
was a simple malfunction.

683
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,625
Aye, sir.

684
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,333
<i>Captain Picard was the person</i>
<i>who first interested me</i>

685
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,250
<i>in the works</i>
<i>of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</i>

686
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:27,041
<i>I have subsequently</i>
<i>become a great admirer</i>

687
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,458
<i>of the fictional detective</i>
<i>Sherlock Holmes</i>

688
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,417
<i>and his ability</i>
<i>to solve mysteries</i>

689
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:34,750
<i>by careful examination</i>
<i>of the available evidence.</i>

690
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:46,625
<i>I have found</i>
<i>Holmes' methodology</i>

691
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:49,166
<i>of deductive reasoning</i>
<i>to be quite useful.</i>

692
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,917
<i>One of his adages is</i>

693
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:52,875
<i>that, once you have</i>
<i>eliminated the impossible</i>

694
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:58,041
<i>whatever remains, however</i>
<i>improbable, must be the truth.</i>

695
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:01,834
I'm sorry,
I don't have time

696
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,834
to give you another lesson
right now, Data.

697
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,375
That is not my purpose.

698
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:08,166
I would like to examine
the remains of Ambassador T'Pel

699
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,667
left on the transporter pad.

700
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:12,417
I'm working on the report
right now.

701
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:15,709
Have you
compared the genetic code

702
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,583
with the Ambassador's last
recorded transporter ID traces?

703
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:22,458
No, that's not
standard procedure. Why?

704
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,375
I could be chasing an untamed
ornithoid without cause.

705
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:29,959
A wild goose chase?

706
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,542
All right.

707
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:40,667
Computer, access the transporter
ID trace for Ambassador T'Pel.

708
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,417
All right.

709
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,834
There's the genetic record
of the Ambassador

710
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,291
when she beamed aboard the
<i>Enterprise.</i>

711
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,041
Now, the breakdown
of the organic material

712
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:52,166
found on the transporter pad
should be identical.

713
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:57,917
Mitochondrial structure
fits the general parameters.

714
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:59,166
No change

715
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,417
in the nucleotide bases.

716
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:03,875
Hmm, there's
a slight discrepancy

717
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:06,125
in the base pair sequence.

718
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:10,709
Chemically, these
are identical, however

719
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,667
the organic sample
from the transporter

720
00:35:12,709 --> 00:35:15,709
is showing numerous
single-bit errors--

721
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,667
like replicated material.

722
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:18,875
Can you postulate

723
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,125
an explanation
for the discrepancy?

724
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:24,875
I'd say the DNA was either
mutated by the transporter

725
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:26,917
during the re-materialization
process...

726
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:30,000
A supposition not supported
by the transporter records.

727
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:34,834
...or these aren't the remains
of the Ambassador.

728
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:44,250
The only abnormality
found during my investigation

729
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:48,041
was a temporary increase in the
matter-to-energy signal ratio.

730
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,208
Due to the circumstances

731
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,917
I decided to investigate
the possibility

732
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:54,375
that a<i> second</i> transporter signal
had caused the fluctuation.

733
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:55,959
Although this is
highly improbable

734
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,709
it was the only
remaining theory.

735
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,083
A second transporter signal--
from where?

736
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,583
From the<i> Devoras.</i>

737
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:02,959
Romulan transporters operate

738
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,166
on a similar subspace frequency
to our own.

739
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,291
With only minor adjustments,
they can be made

740
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,000
to simulate our own
transporter carrier wave.

741
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:15,750
Are you saying they beamed
the Ambassador off our own pad?

742
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,166
While simultaneously

743
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,750
a small amount
of genetically similar material

744
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:22,667
was left
in the Ambassador's place.

745
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:24,333
To make us believe
that she had died

746
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,834
as a result of the malfunction.

747
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,291
Yes, sir.

748
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:30,917
Mr. Worf,
where is the<i> Devoras</i> now?

749
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:33,458

752
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:43,875
<i>The safest and most logical</i>
<i>decision in this situation</i>

753
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:46,709
<i>is to contact Starfleet</i>
<i>and await further</i>

<i>based on past experience</i>

755
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,792
<i>I project only a 17% chance</i>

756
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,500

776

I can assure you

777
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:50,834
there is no one being held
captive aboard this ship.

778

779
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,375

to protect the lives
of Federation citizens.

786
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:20,417

this abduction to succeed.

787

789
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,750
Admiral Mendak, I will take
whatever action is necessary

790
