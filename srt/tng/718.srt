1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:04,250
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:06,875
We are losing containment
in the starboard nacelle tube.

3
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:10,375
Try to get more power
to the field coils.
Aye, sir.

4
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:12,083
Mr. La Forge, report.

5
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,166
I can't shut down
the plasma injectors.

6
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,458
Somebody's locked out
the controls.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,834
The plasma venting system
has engaged.

8
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,542
Two more decks.

9
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:30,417
Riker to Bridge.

10
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,166
We've almost reached
the nacelle tube.

11
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,542
PICARD:
Acknowledged.

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,375
Release the exterior
hull plate.

13
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:37,125
We may have
to jettison the core.

14
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,250
Aye, sir.

15
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,542
What happened?

16
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,458
He locked out
the controls.

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,291
Before we knew what was
happening, he stepped up
onto the walkway.

18
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,458
See if you can help shut
down the plasma flow.

19
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,250
I'm afraid if we try
to get any closer,

20
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,542
he will jump through
the force field.

21
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:12,083
Dan...? It's me.
It's Will Riker.

22
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,250
I was here yesterday,
remember?

23
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:28,333
I didn't want to do it.

24
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:36,291
But I saw them,

25
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,667
and they laughed at me.

26
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,834
They laughed.

27
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,583
Whatever happened,
we can talk about it.

28
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:47,917
I want to help.

29
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,458
Stay away!

30
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:53,667
I just want
to see your face.

31
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:56,917
That's all...
so we can talk.

32
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,041
I...

33
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,792
know what I have to do.

34
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,500
Dan, no!

35
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:07,917
I have unlocked the controls.

36
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,166
COMPUTER:
Shutdown procedure initiated.

37
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,875
There's still plasma
in the injector.

38
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:13,917
It will take time
to vent off.

39
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,709
Tell me what happened.

40
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,333
Maybe I can help.

41
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,458
I know what I have to do.

42
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,959
PICARD:
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

44
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

45
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:11,834
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

46
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:16,291
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

47
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:20,208
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

48
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,000
A few more seconds,
I could have saved his life.

49
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,417
Commander, you did
everything you could.

50
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,542
It was not your fault.

51
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,250
It was strange.

52
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,875
I felt as if he didn't even
recognize me...

53
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:36,709
even though I was with him
just the other day

54
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,709
when I supervised
the tube refit.

55
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,125
How did he seem then?

56
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,750
Fine.

57
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:44,542
I complimented him
on getting the refit done

58
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,291
faster than expected.

59
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,709
He was pleased
that I had noticed.

60
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,166
I met with him
about six weeks ago

61
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,291
during the crew
evaluations.

62
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,000
He was very positive.

63
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,250
He was looking forward to being
posted to the nacelle tube.

64
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,667
He was a good officer

65
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,917
with a fine career
ahead of him.

66
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,625
I don't understand
why he wanted...

67
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:08,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

68
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,250
In my years
as a Starfleet Captain,

69
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,041
I have had to notify
many parents

70
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,375
of the loss of loved ones,
but never before to suicide.

71
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:23,083
I would like to be able to offer
Lieutenant Kwan's parents

72
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,375
some explanation
of what happened

73
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:28,333
to try to help them
make sense of this.

74
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,750
Well, maybe he left, um...

75
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:33,291
a message of some kind

76
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,417
explaining why he did it.

77
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,959
I would like the two of you

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,250
to piece together a picture
of his last few days.

79
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,417
If he made any
personal logs,

80
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,375
it might be helpful
to look through them.

81
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:45,125
You're authorized to do so.

82
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,667
La Forge to Captain.
Go ahead.

83
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:53,875
I've just finished
my damage assessment.

84
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:55,583
We should be able to get
underway,

85
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,000
I'd say within the hour.

86
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,959
Mr. La Forge,
the medical situation

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,709
on Barson II has worsened.

88
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,542
Starfleet has
given us permission

89
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,667
to exceed warp speed limitations
so as to get back on schedule.

90
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:09,333
We'll be able to give you
warp eight if we need it.
Acknowledged.

91
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,750
Geordi...

92
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:15,250
would you agree that the
instinct for self-preservation

93
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,542
is shared by
most life-forms?

94
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,792
I'd say it's probably
the most basic instinct, Data.

95
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,750
That being the case,

96
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,667
I find it difficult
to understand

97
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:28,250
why someone would deliberately
terminate their own existence.

98
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,917
(<i> sighs</i> )
I don't know, Data.

99
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,542
All I can think is
that maybe Lieutenant Kwan

100
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,458
felt that there was
something...

101
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,750
wrong with his life.

102
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:41,542
Something that he felt
powerless to fix.

103
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,458
I believe I understand.

104
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,750
I have been in
a similar situation.

105
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,000
Really?

106
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,959
The first months
following my activation

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,125
were a difficult
period for me.

108
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,500
There were many problems

109
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,709
associated with
my becoming sentient.

110
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,542
Because your neural net
was still forming.

111
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,250
Mm-hmm.

112
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:08,333
As I acquired new skills,
neural pathways would form

113
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,959
replacing other
less complex pathways.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,083
It was very...
disorienting.

115
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,375
I bet.

116
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,792
As my systems grew
in complexity,

117
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,959
it became
increasingly difficult

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,542
to integrate new pathways

119
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,542
into my existing
neural net.

120
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,125
The probability
of cascade failure grew

121
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,959
with each
additional pathway.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,625
I came to the conclusion

123
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,000
it would be safer,
and easier,

124
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,291
to shut myself down
and start again.

125
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,208
Yeah, but if you
had done that,

126
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,500
you wouldn't have remembered
any of the things that
had happened to you.

127
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,417
In a way...

128
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,208
it would have been like
committing suicide.

129
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,417
So what did you do?

130
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,625
I decided against
the procedure.

131
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,250
I chose, instead,

132
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,375
to treat the problems
I was having with my systems

133
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,166
as challenges to overcome

134
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,166
rather than obstacles
to be avoided.

135
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,208
That's a great way
to look at it, Data.

136
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,917
I only wish Lieutenant
Kwan had been able

137
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,166
to look at his
problems the same way.

138
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,250
This is a Napean design.

139
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,041
His mother is Napean.

140
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,792
His father is human.

141
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,959
It all looks so normal.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,041
For some reason,
I half expected

143
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,667
the place
to be a mess.

144
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,083
Yes.

145
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,583
It is strange
to think that someone

146
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,667
could have considered
ending his life

147
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,625
and yet give
no outward sign.

148
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:36,375
Just before he jumped,
he seemed almost... calm.

149
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,458
Well, he must have been
in a lot of pain

150
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,959
to do what he did.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,291
It could be that the prospect
of ending the pain

152
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,583
felt like
a great relief.

153
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,417
This is Ensign
Calloway, isn't it?
Yes.

154
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,917
She is a medical
technician in Sick Bay.

155
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,917
It's always hard to lose
someone you care about,

156
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,250
but to lose them
like this...

157
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,792
We should check
his personal logs.

158
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,041
This is his last entry.

159
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,583
He made it before going
on duty this morning.

160
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:18,792
Personal Log,
Stardate 47622.1:

161
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,917
We finally finished the
nacelle tube refit last night.

162
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,792
After pulling
two double shifts in a row,

163
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:28,041
I'm really looking forward to
spending some time with Maddy.

164
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,166
Ensign Calloway.

165
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,542
That doesn't sound
like a man

166
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,542
who's planning
on taking his own life.

167
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,583
No. No, it does not.

168
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,792
I can't believe
he's really gone.

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,041
I keep thinking he's going to
show up and tell me

170
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,875
there's been some kind of
terrible misunderstanding.

171
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,333
I thought you might like to know
that in his personal logs,

172
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,083
Dan talked about you
a great deal.

173
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,917
He loved you very much.

174
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,625
If that's true...

175
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,959
then how could he
leave me like this?

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,750
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

177
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:19,000
I know it's hard
to talk right now,

178
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,375
but it would be
very helpful

179
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,333
if you could tell me
a few things about him.

180
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,000
When was the last time
you saw him?

181
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,834
Two nights ago.

182
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,500
We were planning our next
shore leave together.

183
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:33,208
Did he mention anything
that had happened recently,

184
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,166
anything that might
have upset him?

185
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,834
No, not really.

186
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,792
He did say something about work,
about Lieutenant Nara,

187
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:42,959
but it wasn't
anything serious.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,667
Nara... she's his superior
in the nacelle tube.

189
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,667
Yes.

190
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:51,291
Dan sensed that she...

191
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,041
Well, that she felt
threatened by him--

192
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,792
that she thought
he was after her position.

193
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,417
Was he prone to mood swings
or depression?

194
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,792
No...

195
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:05,667
but he was very sensitive
to other people's moods.

196
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,458
He used to look at me

197
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,542
and know exactly
what I was feeling.

198
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,667
I always loved
that about him.

199
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:14,750
Well, Napeans are
partially empathetic.

200
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:17,667
He may have inherited some of
his mother's abilities.

201
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:20,500
He used to tease me
that when I met her,

202
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:23,709
I wouldn't be able
to get away with anything.

203
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,542
Dan and I knew each other
for over two years,

204
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:32,250
but we didn't get together
until a few months ago.

205
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,834
We took it slow.

206
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,750
We thought we had
all the time in the world.

207
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,583
Something must have happened
to him, Counselor--

208
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,083
something terrible--
because it's not like Dan

209
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,917
to take his own life.
I understand.

210
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,667
Please...

211
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,667
find out what it was.

212
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,000
Can I help you?
(<i> gasps</i> )

213
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,917
Oh, I didn't
see you there.

214
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,500
You're Lieutenant Nara,
aren't you?

215
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,500
Can I do something
for you, Counselor?

216
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm investigating
Lieutenant Kwan's death.

217
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,083
I just wanted
to look around.

218
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,792
It's such a shame.

219
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,750
He was a good man.

220
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,250
Did you notice any change
in his behavior recently?

221
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,583
No.

222
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,583
I've been going over
the last few days in my mind,

223
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,834
trying to see if I...

224
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,583
if I missed
any warning signs.

225
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,917
It's as if something
inside him just snapped.

226
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,959
How was his
job performance?

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,375
Excellent.

228
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:51,125
He knew this ship better
than most people,

229
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,750
probably because
he helped build it

230
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,208
back at Utopia Planitia.

231
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,834
Did he get along
with his coworkers?

232
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,500
He was ambitious.

233
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:01,458
He came in here with
all sorts of new ideas

234
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,959
about how to do things--

235
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,375
some of them
very good ideas.

236
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,750
But not all?

237
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,500
No.

238
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:11,333
But after he settled in,
we got along fine.

239
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,875
Excuse me a minute.

240
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,625
Feel free to look around.

241
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,792
Where was Lieutenant
Kwan's station?

242
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,583
Right there.

243
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,250
(<i> gasping</i> )

244
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,834
Are you all right?
(<i> gasps</i> )

245
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,417
I don't know.

246
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,917
I don't know how
to describe it.

247
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,458
I was suddenly overwhelmed
by a flood of emotions--

248
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,959
fear, rage, panic--

249
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,917
and the sensations didn't seem
to be coming from any person.

250
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:52,083
They were just there
in the room.

251
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,583
Well, then whose
emotions were they?

252
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,000
I thought you said
you were alone.

253
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,583
I was.

254
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,166
I scanned the area.

255
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,750
I found no
anomalous readings.

256
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:04,041
How could you get an empathic
impression from an empty room?

257
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,333
I don't know.

258
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,959
Could the fact
that Lieutenant Kwan

259
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,250
was partially empathic
have anything to do with it?

260
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,500
What do you mean?

261
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,333
I'm not sure,

262
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,834
but certainly
the feelings Troi described

263
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,250
are consistent with suicide.

264
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,959
Could his death have left
some sort of empathic echo?

265
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,709
I don't see how,

266
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,333
but if I went back
to the nacelle tube,

267
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,959
I might get a better sense
of what I experienced.

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
I don't think I'd recommend
that right now.

269
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,875
You're showing elevated
levels of psilosynine.

270
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:32,291
Psilosynine?

271
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,333
It's a neurotransmitter
involved in telepathy.

272
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,917
The experience overwhelmed you
the first time.

273
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:40,750
I think you should wait until
your levels return to normal.

274
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,166
How long?

275
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,375
Three, maybe four hours.

276
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,208
This time, I want
someone with you.

277
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,583
I shall accompany you,
Counselor.

278
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:57,500
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47623.2:</i>

279

282
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,166
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come in.

283
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,667
Hello, Worf.
Counselor.

284
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:16,458
Have you found anything
in Lieutenant Kwan's logs?

285
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,125
Everything I've read suggests
that he was well-adjusted

286
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,750
and optimistic.

287
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:24,875
It just doesn't
make any sense.

288
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,667
Can I get you anything?

289
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,834
No. No, nothing.

290
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,834
Yridian tea.

291
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,166
I've been thinking
about what happened to me

292
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,625
in the nacelle tube...

293
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:42,375
whether it was
an empathic echo

294
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,125
left by Kwan's death.

295
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,000
In the past, have your
empathic experiences

296
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,625
always involved the physical
presence of another person?

297
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,542
All the ones
I'm sure of, yes.

298
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,875
What do you mean,
"sure of"?

299
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:00,667
Well, when I was
a little girl,

300
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,834
my grandfather used to
tell me stories by the fire.

301
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,500
I would close my eyes

302
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:08,834
and listen to his mind
for hours on end.

303
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,959
He would tell you these
stories telepathically?

304
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,542
My grandfather
rarely spoke.

305
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,333
He said that was
for off-worlders

306
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,625
and people who didn't
know any better.

307
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:24,125
Now, the only time
I can remember his stories

308
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,458
is when I go home
and sit by the fireplace.

309
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,458
Sometimes,
when I'm alone there,

310
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,208
it's almost as if I can hear
his voice inside my head.

311
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,917
Yes. Yes, I, too,
have sought visions in fire.

312
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:42,667
I can't explain it,
but it feels real to me.

313
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:46,375
Just like what happened
in the nacelle tube.

314
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:50,041
There are things
we do not understand,

315
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,834
yet they exist nonetheless.

316
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,625
(<i> sighs</i> )

317
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,875
Perhaps I should let you
get some rest.

318
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,083
Oh, it's all right.

319
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,875
No. If you will excuse me,
Counselor.

320
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,834
I'll be right back.

321
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:32,417
Mr. Worf.
Commander.

322
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,959
Two Til'amin froths,
please.
Yes, sir.

323
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,834
Lieutenant Corell seems to be
enjoying your company.

324
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,667
I'd like to think so.

325
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,750
Are you involved
with her?

326
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,291
I'm not sure yet.

327
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,041
Why, are you
interested in her?

328
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,375
No, no.

329
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,625
But, if I were,
I would, of course,

330
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:01,917
discuss the situation with you
before proceeding further.

331
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,291
I appreciate it,

332
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,875
but that really wouldn't
have been necessary.

333
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:06,500
I mean, I would never
want to come between

334
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,583
you and someone
you are involved with

335
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,834
or had ever had been
involved with.

336
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,333
Is there someone in particular
that you're talking about?

337
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,041
No.

338
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,667
Is there someone
in particular

339
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:20,000
you would rather I<i> not</i> 
be involved with?

340
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,834
Mr. Worf, you sound like a man
who's asking his friend

341
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,291
if he can start
dating his sister.

342
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,000
No, no, I was merely...

343
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,083
Never mind.
Excuse me, sir.

344
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,166
Could you open
this door for me?

345
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,542
Yes, but only
for a short time.

346
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,333
After 90 seconds,

347
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,291
the plasma venting system
will engage

348
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,291
to prevent degradation
of the force field.

349
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,208
I just want
to take a quick look.

350
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,875
May I ask what
you're looking for?

351
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:23,709
I'm not sure.

352
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,792
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

353
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:31,875
COMPUTER:

00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,208
(<i> sharp thud, Troi gasps</i> )

356
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,834
No, no!
No, please!

357
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,375
Please, please!

358
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:44,250
No! Don't!

359
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,250
No!

360
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,542
(<i> thud</i> )

361
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,125
COMPUTER:

362
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,750

363
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,875
(<i> thud</i> )

364
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:58,583
(<i> thud</i> )

365
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,208
Worf?

366
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:24,041
Worf?

367
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,875
(<i> woman laughing</i> )

368
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,917
(<i> murmured conversation</i> )

369
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
(<i> suppressing laughter</i> )

370
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:01,625
(<i> both laughing</i> )

371
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,291
Counselor,
are you all right?

372
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,250
Let's get out of here.

373
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:27,125
Do you remember
anything else?

374
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,500
TROI:
Yes, I think I do.

375
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,083
There was a tool
crate on the floor.

376
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,583
It was labeled
"Utopia Planitia."

377
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,333
The shipyard where
the<i> Enterprise</i> was built.

378
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,458
Clearly, this was much more
than an empathic echo.

379
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
It seems that you were actually
seeing something that happened

380
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,542
in the Control Room
eight years ago.

381
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,375
Everyone was looking
directly at me,

382
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:51,750
but it was as though

383
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:54,125
I was seeing through
someone else's eyes.

384
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,583
Lieutenant Kwan
was partially empathic.

385
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,709
Maybe you were seeing it
through his eyes.

386
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,125
It's possible, but I don't see
how it could have happened.

387
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,417
Well, putting that on
one side for the moment,

388
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:07,625
let's assume that by some
inexplicable phenomenon,

389
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:10,041
you witnessed an event

390
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:13,291
that occurred
to Lieutenant Kwan.

391
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:17,250
Those faces that you saw--
did you recognize any of them?

392
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,083
I've never seen
the woman before,

393
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,875
or the man who was with her.

394
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:25,208
But there was
someone else there--

395
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,083
a man.

396
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:31,083
He was staring at me
in the most peculiar way.

397
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:35,959
I think he had reddish hair

398
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,792
and he did seem
familiar to me.

399
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,542
But it's all so hazy.

400
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,709
It's like trying
to remember a dream.

401
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,542
There was a woman
who was frightened

402
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,750
and then you saw her
again, laughing,

403
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,583
presumably at
Lieutenant Kwan.

404
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,333
What does it all mean?

405
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,834
I don't know, but something
terrible happened in that room.

406
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:57,959
I felt it.

407
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,583
Counselor,
I want you to look

408
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,667
through the personnel
files of Utopia Planitia.

409
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,875
See if you recognize
any of those faces.

410
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:05,667
If only I could go back
into the Control Room

411
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:08,125
without being overwhelmed
by the experience.

412
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,125
It might help me
remember some detail

413
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,959
that might be relevant.

414
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,834
I could give you an inhibitor
that would slow down

415
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,333
the brain's production
of psilosynine.

416
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,291
That might be able to suppress
your empathic abilities

417
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,458
and make the experience
more manageable.

418
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,375
It would take about 16 hours
to synthesize the inhibitor.

419
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:27,166
I'd like to try that.
Very well, Counselor.

420
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

421
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:36,792
I apologize
for being late.

422
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,709
The viral medicines we are
transporting to Barson II

423
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,166
require special
security measures

424
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:45,125
to insure they are
properly contained.

425
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,667
Have you found anything?

426
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,917
No.

427
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:51,250
There were literally
thousands of people involved

428
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,500
in building
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

429
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:59,083
Perhaps you should try to
narrow the search parameters.

430
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,583
I think I have.

431
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,083
The man who looked
familiar to me

432
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,709
may have served
on board the<i> Enterprise</i>

433
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,125
in the last seven years,

434
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,333
so I've asked the computer
to limit its search

435
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:10,125
to personnel who served
at Utopia Planitia

436
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:13,000
and on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

437
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:15,250
Ensign Salvatore--

438
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,834
he transferred
over a year ago.

439
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,500
Lieutenant Ziff--

440
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:21,625
she's in quantum mechanics.

441
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,792
That's him.

442
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:27,291
WORF:
Lieutenant Walter Pierce.

443
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,583
I remember now.

444
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,542
He came on board
about six months ago.

445
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,750
I think he's
in Engineering.

446
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:44,291
You were Lieutenant Kwan's
supervisor at Utopia Planitia.

447
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,583
That's right.

448
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,709
I was sorry
to hear what happened.

449
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,458
Did you ever spend time in
the nacelle Control Room

450
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,250
while it was
under construction?

451
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,458
I worked all over the ship.

452
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,166
In fact, I remember
running a power conduit

453
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,458
right behind this wall,
here.

454
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,041
TROI: Were you ever
in the nacelle room

455
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,208
at the same time
as Lieutenant Kwan?

456
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,166
It was a long time ago.

457
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,375
People were working
all over the place.

458
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:10,959
So you do not remember?

459
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm sorry, I don't.

460
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,125
Do you recall if anything
unusual happened there?

461
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:20,458
How do you mean?

462
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,667
An altercation perhaps?

463
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:24,750
Possibly involving
Lieutenant Kwan.

464
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,959
No, nothing like that.

465
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,500
The way I remember it,
things went pretty smoothly.

466
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:34,166
What's this all about,
if you don't mind my asking?
Not at all.

467
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:37,959
When I was in the nacelle room,
I had an empathic experience.

468
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,917
We believe the Counselor
may have been seeing

469
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,625
an event that occurred
eight years ago.

470
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,333
And I saw you there.

471
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:48,625
Do you have any idea
why that might be?

472
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,041
I'm afraid I don't.

473
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:53,041
Lieutenant,
are you aware

474
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,667
that I can sense when
someone's telling the truth?

475
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:57,208
I've heard that.

476
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,667
Then, I'm sure that
if you remember anything

477
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,834
that might be relevant
to our investigation,

478
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,125
you'll contact me.

479
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:05,125
Oh, of course.

480
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:08,000
Thank you, Lieutenant.

481
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,458
Counselor.

482
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:18,959
The strange thing is,
I couldn't read him at all.

483
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,792
But you implied that...

484
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,959
We have played poker
many times.

485
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,875
I've never known
you to bluff.

486
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,458
Well, it wouldn't be
much of a bluff

487
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,792
if you knew,
would it?

488
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:31,542
The fact that
I couldn't read him

489
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,417
suggests that he has at least
some telepathic ability.

490
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:35,834
But Pierce is human.

491
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:37,959
That's what
I don't understand.

492
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,208
Even though I couldn't
read his emotions,

493
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,667
I did feel that he was
holding something back.

494
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:45,000
I thought so,
as well.

495
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,875
Maybe we should
try to access

496
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:49,375
the Engineering logs
from Utopia Planitia.

497
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,625
We might find out
more about him.

498
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,834
There may be something in them
about Lieutenant Kwan, as well.

499
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,709
Mm-hmm.

500
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,959
It's going to take
about half an hour

501
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,709
for the transmission
to be completed.

502
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,333
Perhaps we should continue
this in the morning.

503
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,250
It is late.

504
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:23,583
Yes, and you must be tired.

505
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,250
A little.

506
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:29,083
So, I will say good night.

507
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,166
Good night.

508
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,166
We should get
an early start tomorrow.

509
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,583
I think we should.

510
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,417
I'll see you
in the morning.

511
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,458
Yes.

512
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,208
Hello.

513
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,500
Breakfast is ready.

514
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,208
That sounds nice,

515
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,083
but it can wait.

516
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,750
Why didn't we do this
a long time ago?

517
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:08,625
DR. CRUSHER:
Crusher to Counselor Troi.

518
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:11,041
Yes, Doctor?

519
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,000
I've synthesized
the inhibitor.

520
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,667
Please come to Sick Bay
whenever you're ready.

521
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:16,792
Acknowledged.

522
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:22,375
DR. CRUSHER:
Crusher to Lieutenant Worf.

523
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,417
Worf here.

524
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,375
DR. CRUSHER: Medical supplies
are ready to be taken

525
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:28,583
to Cargo Bay for transport.

526
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,667
I will be there shortly.

527
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,750
This should take effect
immediately.

528
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,166
Will it completely suppress
my empathic abilities?

529
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,166
It's hard to say
for sure,

530
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:46,792
but I can always increase
the dosage if it's not enough.

531
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:50,917
The Cargo Bay
will be off limits

532
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,583
to all but
medical personnel.

533
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,792
Thanks for your help, sir.
You're welcome.

534
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:00,709
Good morning.
Counselor.

535
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,709
Data and Geordi are already
in the nacelle tube.

536
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,917
Are you ready?
Yes.

537
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,291
CALLOWAY:
Excuse me, sir.

538
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,834
About the quarantine field
in the Cargo Bay,

539
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,083
it looks like we'll need
a second field generator.

540
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,083
I am needed here.

541
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,542
I will join you
as soon as I can.

542
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,041
All right.

543
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,667
WORF: Apparently my help
was not so good after all.

544
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:24,458
CALLOWAY:
(<i> chuckles</i> ) Yes, it was.

545
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,375
You were wonderful.

546
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,875
I think I know
what is wrong.

547
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,333
The generator
dispersion...

548
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:43,000
Counselor, are you okay?

549
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,458
I'm fine.

550
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,875
The inhibitor seems
to be working.

551
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,500
Have you found anything?

552
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:51,500
No, nothing unusual.

553
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,500
I don't remember seeing these
during my empathic experience.

554
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:03,875
Have they been here
since the ship was built?

555
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:06,083
No, they were installed
two years ago.

556
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:17,000
Geordi...

557
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,500
I remember seeing
a plasma conduit right there.

558
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:27,083
The main ODN line runs
right behind that panel.

559
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:29,041
It lifts out,
so you can get to it.

560
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,291
Kwan was working
on that conduit

561
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,959
the day before
he died.

562
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,458
Can you open it?

563
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,959
Sure, it'll take
just a minute.

564
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,458
Data.

565
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:03,875
Lieutenant Nara,
may I ask you something?

566
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,083
The work Lieutenant Kwan
was doing--

567
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,875
was it unusual in any way?

568
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:11,500
He was refitting
a field coil,

569
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:13,208
but it was probably
the first time

570
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,959
that particular panel's
been opened

571
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,250
since the ship was built.

572
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:18,375
Thank you.

573
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:27,333
(<i> sharp thud</i> )

574
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,417
No!

575
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:36,750
LA FORGE:
Counselor?

576
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:38,500
Are you all right?

577
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:42,709
Something happened
when you removed the panel.

578
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,250
There's something in there.

579
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:54,458
I am getting readings
that indicate organic material

580
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,083
embedded in this wall.

581
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,375
Organic?

582
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:58,875
(<i> tool humming</i> )

583
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:00,750
You're right.

584
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,166
Let me reconfigure
the emitter beam.

585
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,917
We might be able
to see what it is.

586
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,625
There.

587
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:21,000
This dosage should prevent
any further empathic flashes.

588
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:26,125
The bone fragments
are definitely human.

589
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:28,041
I sequenced
a DNA sample.

590
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,709
I'll see if I can match it
to Starfleet records.

591
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:38,333
Accessing Starfleet
personnel records.

592
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:39,959
I'd say these fragments
have been in the wall

593
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,834
about seven
or eight years.

594
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,125
WORF: ...your help with
the Barson medical supplies...

595
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,250
DR. CRUSHER:
You said something happened
when the panel was opened.

596
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,625
Yes.

597
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,333
I wonder if
these fragments

598
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,291
could have somehow
triggered your experience?

599
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:55,542
I'll run a resonance scan,
see if anything turns up.

600
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:58,125
Sir, I think
we've found a match.

601
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,417
Apparently,
the remains

602
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,041
are those of
an Ensign Marla Finn.

603
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,667
I'm trying to find
a picture of her in the records.

604
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:10,542
TROI:
That's her.

605
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:12,917
That's the woman I saw.

606
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,792
It says she was
reported missing

607
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:23,625
"from Utopia Planitia
on Stardate 40987.2."

608
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:26,583
Eight years ago.

609
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,417
But how did her body become
embedded in a bulkhead?

610
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:31,709
Maybe there was some kind
of an accident.

611
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,417
Or she was killed

612
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,000
and the murderer
hid her remains.

613
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,583
Something's not right.

614
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:41,208
Pull up Lieutenant Kwan's
service record.

615
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,375
I thought so.

616
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:46,208
He didn't arrive
at the shipyard

617
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,834
until six months
after Finn's death.

618
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,875
I couldn't have been seeing
through his eyes.

619
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:52,417
Then whose?

620
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:53,917
Well, it would have
to be someone

621
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,667
who was at least
partially telepathic.

622
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:56,917
Pierce.

623
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:59,667
DR. CRUSHER:
But you saw him there.

624
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:02,417
Yes, but not as clearly
as I could see everything else.

625
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,792
His face looked...

626
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:07,041
like that.

627
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,583
DR. CRUSHER:
A reflection.

628
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,959
So I<i> was</i> seeing
through his eyes.

629
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,750
And Finn was trying
to get away from him.

630
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:16,959
She was afraid of him.

631
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,500
I think it is time

632
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,917
we had another conversation
with Lieutenant Pierce.

633
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,667
Ensign Calloway...

634
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,500
thank you for your help.

635
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,333
Deck ten.

636
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,792
Worf, can I ask
you something?

637
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:07,959
Do you regret
what happened last night?

638
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,709
No. No, of course not.
Are you sure?

639
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,583
Because I don't want
to jeopardize our friendship.

640
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:17,667
Deanna, I do not regret
being with you.

641
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:22,125
What is wrong?

642
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

643
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:28,500
I'm not... feeling myself.

644
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:30,500
Maybe it's the inhibitor.

645
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,834
I'm so used to sensing
what people are feeling

646
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,417
and now I can't.

647
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:38,750
Perhaps I should talk
to Lieutenant Pierce alone.

648
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:40,333
That might be a good idea.

649
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:43,333
I will meet you
in your quarters later.

650
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:46,208
I'll be waiting for you.

651
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,917
Deck eight.

652
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,083
(<i> door chimes</i> )

653
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:08,500
Come in.

654
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:26,375
Security to
Counselor Troi's quarters.
SECURITY: Acknowledged.

655
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:28,208
I don't understand.

656
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,917
Lieutenant Worf said you wanted
to talk to me about something.

657
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:32,208
Where is he?

658
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,667
He said he had
to go somewhere.

659
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:37,125
Troi to Worf.

660
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:41,375
Computer,
where is Lieutenant Worf?

661
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:45,083
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Worf is
in Ensign Calloway's quarters.

662
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,500
(<i> door opens</i> )

663
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,166
Counselor?

664
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:53,041
Take Lieutenant Pierce to
his quarters and hold him there.

665
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,417
Security override.

666
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:20,166
Authorization:
Troi-delta-two-nine.

667
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,542
(<i> giggling</i> )

668
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:33,583
Stop it.

669
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,417
Stop it!

670
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,333
Stop it!

671
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,583
(<i> gasps</i> )

672
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,500
(<i> screams</i> )

673
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,000
(<i> gasping</i> )

674
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,834
(<i> cries out</i> )

675
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,625
CALLOWAY:
He's dead.

676
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:02,250
You killed him!

677
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:03,792
No!

678
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,041
You know what
you have to do.

679
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,250
(<i> whimpering</i> )

680
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:06,500
I know what I have to do.

681
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:13,458
COMPUTER: Warning--
What are you doing?

682
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,083
COMPUTER: Plasma venting system
will engage in 70 seconds.

683
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,625
You're alive.

684
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:19,709
You're all right.

685
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:36,583
I opened the maintenance door
at Counselor Troi's request.

686
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:39,500
Then turned to see her standing
too close to the force field.

687
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,125
It all seemed
so real to me.

688
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,333
I can't believe that
everything I experienced

689
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,709
happened in just
those few seconds.

690
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,417
It appears Counselor Troi
was correct.

691
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:51,667
Pierce was
partially telepathic.

692
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,917
His maternal grandmother
was born on Betazed.

693
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,542
What else have
you found out?

694
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,250
DATA:
According to Starfleet records

695
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:01,500
Pierce and the other persons
Counselor Troi identified

696
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:04,333
were killed in an accidental
plasma discharge

697
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:05,750
eight years ago.

698
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:07,375
Their bodies
were never found.

699
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:09,583
I don't believe
it was an accident.

700
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:12,583
I think Lieutenant Pierce
found out the other two
were having an affair.

701
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,834
He lost control
and he killed them both.

702
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:18,333
Afterwards, he probably
activated the plasma stream

703
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,083
and then threw
himself into it.

704
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:22,291
The plasma discharge
would have obliterated

705
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,959
any evidence
that it was murder.

706
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,291
(<i> door opens</i> )

707
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:32,458
I scanned behind the panel
Counselor Troi asked me to.

708
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,834
I didn't find
any bone fragments,

709
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:38,417
but I did find some traces
of cellular residue.

710
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:41,625
It's showing some kind
of psionic signature.

711
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,667
It may be that
when Lieutenant Pierce

712
00:42:43,709 --> 00:42:45,583
was struck by
the plasma stream,

713
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:47,583
the subspace energy
present there

714
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:50,750
imprinted his empathic pattern
into the residue.

715
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:52,542
Kind of like
a psychic photograph.

716
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:55,458
That's what triggered
my hallucination.

717
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,291
My mind must have taken
elements from my own life

718
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,792
and then created
a situation

719
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:04,750
that, in many ways, mirrored
what happened to Pierce.

720
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:09,834
If you hadn't been there,

721
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:12,458
I would have jumped
just like he did.

722
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,250
Counselor.

723
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:30,166
When I pulled you
from the plasma stream,

724
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:32,041
you seemed...

725
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:34,458
surprised I was alive.

726
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,333
Well, actually...

727
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:39,875
in my hallucination,
you were killed.

728
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,583
May I ask by whom?

729
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:45,458
Well, you know what
they say, Mr. Worf.

730
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,291
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.
