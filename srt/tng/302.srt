(<i> strings being tuned</i> )

2
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:23,083
(<i> ensemble tuning</i>
<i>and warming up</i> )

3
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,208
Captain, Doctor, I am
honored by your presence,

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,458
but may I suggest
you attend the second concert?

5
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,291
Why, Data?

6
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,750
Ensign Ortiz will perform
the violin part.

7
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:49,792
My rendition
will be less enjoyable.

8
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh?

9
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,875
Although I am
technically proficient,

10
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:54,834
according
to my fellow performers,

11
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:57,792
I lack... soul.

12
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,417
Data, telling us

13
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,333
why you're going to fail
before you make the attempt

14
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,417
is never wise.

15
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,166
But is not honesty

16
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,792
always the preferred choice?

17
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,250
Excessive honesty
can be disastrous,

18
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,917
particularly in a commander.

19
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,333
Indeed?

20
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,625
Knowing your own
limitations

21
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:19,625
is one thing.

22
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:21,000
Advertising them to a crew

23
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,750
can damage your credibility
as a leader.

24
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,583
Because you will lose
their confidence?

25
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,000
And you may begin

26
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,583
to believe in
those limitations yourself.

27
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,041
(<i> playing "Eine Kleine</i>
<i>Nachtmusik" by Mozart</i> )

28
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:47,500
RIKER:
Captain, we're
receiving a message

29
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:49,792
from the Sheliak Corporate.

30
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,959
Origin point of the message
confirmed, sir.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,500
It is from the Shelia
star system.

32
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:18,208
The Sheliak have not attempted
to communicate

33
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,333
with the Federation
for 111 years.

34
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,834
Why are they doing it now?

35
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,375
On screen.

36
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:28,458
SHELIAK:
Federation creatures,
there are humans

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,709
on the fifth planet
of Tau Cygna.

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,208
This planet was ceded
to the Corporate

39
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,500
in section 133, paragraph 77
of the Treaty of Armens.

40
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:42,625
We will begin settlement
of this world in four days.

41
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,250
Remove the humans.

42
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,583
What the devil...?

43
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,875
SHELIAK:
Federation creatures

44
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,375
there are humans
on the fifth planet...

45
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,875
Cancel message.

46
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:55,959
Tau Cygna V
is in the de Laure belt--

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,333
heavy concentrations
of hyperonic radiation.

48
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,375
Humans can't survive
in that environment.

49
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:03,083
Exposure to hyperonic radiation
is fatal.

50
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,333
Then the Sheliak are
asking us to chase ghosts.

51
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,834
No, Number One.

52
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:11,500
The Sheliak haven't broken
a century of silence

53
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:14,291
to send us after phantoms.

54
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,667
An investigation is in order.

55
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:19,500
Set course for Tau Cygna V.

56
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,083
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

57
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:56,041
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

58
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

59
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:01,959
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,542
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

61
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:11,000
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

62
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,709
Captain, human life-form
readings from the planet.

63
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,750
So the Sheliak
weren't hallucinating.

64
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,500
Numbers?

65
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,709
Impossible to get
an accurate reading.

66
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,041
High levels of radiation
are disrupting our sensors.

67
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,959
DATA:
Hyperonic radiation

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,166
also interferes
with ship's transporters.

69
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,625
They are now inoperable.

70
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,291
So are the ship's phasers.

71
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,417
How can humans
survive down there?

72
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,250
They must have found
a way to adapt.

73
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,667
Milan's work
with radiation sensitivity

74
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,083
suggests it is possible.

75
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,709
Perhaps with extensive
virotherapy.

76
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,375
Well, whoever they are,
however they survived,

77
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,000
we've got to get them
off the planet.

78
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,959
By treaty, that world still
belongs to the Sheliak.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,625
Who are within their rights

80
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,792
to demand the removal
of these "trespassers."

81
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:01,875
If we don't remove them,
the Sheliak will, forcefully.

82
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,000
How forcefully?

83
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,542
The Sheliak consider humans
a lower life-form.

84
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,166
They would have no compunctions

85
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,208
about exterminating
the intruders.

86
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,750
Mr. Data, as you are unaffected
by hyperonic radiation,

87
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:16,542
I'd like you to go down
to the planet via shuttlecraft

88
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,750
and commence
evacuation procedures.

89
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,291
Aye, sir.

90
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:24,166
Number One...

91
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,709
any speculation on what
we might find down there?

92
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,709
My guess would be
a lone survey craft.

93
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,959
Maybe a dozen
or so survivors.

94
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:51,166
I think it's some sort
of shuttlecraft.

95
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,750
Where's it from?

96
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,542
Look at the markings.

97
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,041
It must be from the Federation.

98
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,250
Greetings, gentlemen.

99
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,208
We saw your ship.

100
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,959
You're the first visitor
we've had in...

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,166
The first visitor

102
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,083
we've<i> ever</i> had.

103
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,083
You're not human?

104
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,333
That is correct.

105
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,542
I am an android.

106
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,208
I am Lieutenant Commander Data

107
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,041
of the Federation Starship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

108
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,333
Our great-grandparents
were citizens

109
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,959
of the Federation.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,834
But you don't want
to waste your time

111
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:28,959
talking to us.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,166
You want to speak to Gosheven.

113
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,625
We'll take you to him.

114
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:34,291
I'm sure the Federation
will be very proud of us.

115
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,333
Wait until you see
all we've accomplished.

116
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,959
And who, precisely,
is "us"?

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,250
Don't you know?

118
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,291
Oh, no, I don't guess
you would.

119
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,667
We're descendants
of the original settlers

120
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:49,250
from the Colony Ship<i> Artemis.</i>

121
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,709
Got it.

122
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,500
The<i> Artemis,</i>
launched 92 years ago.

123
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:54,250
Destination: Septimis Minor.

124
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,875
When they failed to check in,

125
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,208
Starfleet began
an extensive search.

126
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,125
What carried
the<i> Artemis</i>

127
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,709
so far off course?

128
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,875
My local informant does
not have that information.

129
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,667
In the early days
on Tau Cygna V,

130
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:08,709
survival was more important
than history.

131
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,709
Understood.

132
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,542
How many are there?

133
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,166
15,253, sir.

134
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,625
15,000?

135
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,917
Three days,
no transporters...

136
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,333
we'll never get them out
in time.

137
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,000
Shuttles?

138
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,375
Loading all the<i> Enterprise</i>
shuttlecraft to capacity,

139
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,542
evacuation will take...

140
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,750
4 weeks, 4 days.

141
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,333
We need more time.

142
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,709
Mister Data, prepare
the colonists for an evacuation.

143
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,166
Aye, sir.

144
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,667
Get me the Sheliak.

145
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:42,375
Their home world is
quite distant, Captain.

146
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:43,917
This will take some time.

147
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,709
Gosheven, look what's come.

148
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,542
Lieutenant Commander Data
of the Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

149
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,750
He's an android.

150
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,709
So he is.

151
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,333
Well, now that
you're here...

152
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,959
what do you want?

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,166
My mission is to prepare
this colony for evacuation.

154
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,500
Why?

155
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:28,750
Because this planet belongs
to the Sheliak.

156
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,125
And who is this Sheliak?

157
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,834
The term is plural.

158
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,750
The Sheliak are a nonhumanoid,
intelligent life-form,

159
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,500
classification R-3.

160
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:41,375
Well, this colony has
been here over 90 years.

161
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,750
We've never seen a Sheliak.

162
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:47,542
I'd say that makes
Tau Cygna V our planet.

163
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,542
The original destination of the
<i>Artemis</i> was Septimis Minor.

164
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,041
The guidance system
on the<i> Artemis</i> failed.

165
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,208
Took them off course,
far off course.

166
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,208
Our ancestors were lucky
to find any place to land.

167
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,041
And when they did, the radiation
started killing them.

168
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,375
The hyperonic radiation
took the lives of a third

169
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,709
of the colonists,
before they learned
they could adapt to it.

170
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,750
But our colony survived
and prospered.

171
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:10,208
Look around.

172
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,667
We have brought water
to the desert,

173
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,000
built a community.

174
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,542
Your accomplishments
are truly remarkable.

175
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,750
Yet, the Sheliak
and the Federation have a treaty

176
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,542
which clearly makes this planet
Sheliak domain.

177
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,709
Then change the treaty.

178
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,000
That may not
be possible.

179
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,458
The Sheliak wish
to colonize this planet

180
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,083
and are unwilling
to share it with humans.

181
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,583
If you are still here

182
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,583
when the Sheliak
colony ship arrives,

183
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,125
they will
eradicate you.

184
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,792
They'd kill all of us?

185
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,250
They have little regard
for human life.

186
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,583
Thus, the most sensible course
of action

187
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,291
is to prepare
a contingency plan

188
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,750
for the evacuation
of your people.

189
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,125
We're not evacuating.

190
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,333
Perhaps I have not
made myself clear.

191
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,625
Yes, you have.

192
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,166
Let me be equally clear.

193
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:59,208
There's going to be
no evacuation.

194
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,959
You've delivered
your message,

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,542
so go back to your ship.

196
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,333
I have work to do.

197
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,375
Nice catch.

198
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,709
Wonderful reflexes.

199
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,750
Sorry to test you like that,

200
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,542
but I was curious.

201
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,625
Found a new toy, have we, Ardy?

202
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,166
Toy?

203
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,917
This is the most incredible
android I've ever seen.

204
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,542
Have you seen many?

205
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,959
Actually, no.

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,792
You're the first.

207
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:43,041
Only you would get this excited
over a walking calculator.

208
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,542
Cybernetic intelligence
fascinates me.

209
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,959
Are your neural pathways
duotronic?

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,500
No, positronic.

211
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,000
I didn't know
that was possible.

212
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,542
What's your memory capacity?

213
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,875
How many operations
per second?

214
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,542
I have a million questions.

215
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,458
I am afraid I have
no time to answer a
<i>million</i> questions.

216
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,125
I have a mission
to accomplish.

217
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,166
I need to know more
about your people

218
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:07,041
and Gosheven seems
unwilling to talk
to me further.

219
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,750
I'm Ard'rian McKenzie.

220
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:13,917
Perhaps I can help you.

221
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,542
Gentlemen, we're giving you
an assignment.

222
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,917
The one thing
we don't want to hear

223
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,709
is that it's
impossible.

224
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,333
I need the transporters
to function

225
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,709
despite the hyperonic radiation.

226
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,709
Yeah, but that's im...

227
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,917
Yes, sir.

228
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,125
Even if we get
the Sheliak to talk,

229
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,875
they're not likely
to be accommodating.

230
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:49,834
Captain, when the treaty
was first negotiated,

231
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:53,333
the Federation sent
372 legal experts.

232
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,667
What do we have?

233
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,667
Thee and me.

234
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,667
No response.

235
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,667
Try them again.

236
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,667
Boost the signal strength.

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,792
Sheliak Corporate.

238
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,083
This is
the Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

239
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,959
Respond, please.

240
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:35,792
Conversation is
neither required, nor desired.

241
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:39,750
Conversation is necessary
if we are to find a solution

242
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:42,542
to our mutual problem.

243
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,083
Our involvement
in Federation illegality

244
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,291
is not indicated.

245
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,959
Both parties are involved, sir.

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,375
Remove the humans
from the Tau Cygna system.

247
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,125
Three Earth-days remain.

248
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,625
Let us negotiate in good faith.

249
00:13:58,667 --> 00:13:59,834
Negotiate?

250
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,709
To what purpose?

251
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,417
The treaty is signed.

252
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,834
There is a thriving colony
on that planet.

253
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:11,542
Rather than uproot these people,
may I offer a compromise?

254
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,083
Denied.

255
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,458
Why?

256
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,667
The law is paramount.

257
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:18,417
We are entitled.

258
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,959
This is not a law.

259
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,291
It is a treaty.

260
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:27,166
It is... designed to smooth
relations between races,

261
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,709
not to act
as a strait...

262
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,375
...jacket.

263
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:37,667
You really think we'll have
to leave Tau Cygna V?

264
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,750
The possibility
does exist.

265
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:43,250
Yet Gosheven seems unwilling
to prepare for it.

266
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,417
Why?

267
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,333
Maybe because
you're an android.

268
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,709
I don't think Gosheven
likes the idea

269
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,709
of machines
ordering him around.

270
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,917
I am not ordering him
to do anything.

271
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,709
I am merely trying
to persuade him

272
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,750
that his people should
prepare to evacuate.

273
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:00,792
Do you believe
my suggested course of action

274
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,500
should be followed?

275
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:03,875
Of course.

276
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,083
In spite of the fact
that I am an android?

277
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,083
<i>Because</i> of that fact.

278
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,792
I don't have any silly prejudice
against computers.

279
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,208
I like them.

280
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,709
Not that any computer we have

281
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,208
is half as sophisticated
as you are.

282
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,250
No, I would say not.

283
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,667
People can be
selfish, irrational,

284
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,500
stubborn, malicious--
you name it--

285
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,792
but computers
don't have those failings.

286
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:30,917
And you conclude because of this
that I am impartial.

287
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,041
Hence, you accept
my recommendations.

288
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,166
Yet, Gosheven
does not.

289
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,041
Picard to Commander Data.

290
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,542
Data here.

291
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,792
The Sheliak won't bargain.

292
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,709
Understood, sir.

293
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,750
I'm contacting Starfleet
to arrange transport.

294
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,750
Get those people prepared
to evacuate.

295
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,166
We may have to move quickly.

296
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,417
Aye, sir.

297
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,333
We must speak
to Gosheven immediately.

298
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

299
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,000
Hmm, mm, mm.

300
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,792
Gentlemen, how's it coming?

301
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,834
What the hell
is that?

302
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,709
Our first attempt.

303
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,792
Keep at it.

304
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,792
We need those transporters.

305
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,750
(<i> water running</i> )

306
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,375
You see this?

307
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:51,583
You have any idea what it is
or what it means?

308
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,250
It is water,
a substance composed

309
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,959
of two atoms
of hydrogen...

310
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,458
It's not water.

311
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,083
It's blood and it's sweat.

312
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,375
It's the result of 90 years
of combined effort.

313
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,792
This isn't a town,

314
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:06,250
it's a monument
to every man, woman, and child

315
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,583
who's lived and died
on Tau Cygna V.

316
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,375
Gosheven,
you're talking nonsense.

317
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:11,750
Am I?

318
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:15,041
My grandfather is buried
on that mountain.

319
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,375
He died in a rock slide

320
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,667
surveying the route
for this aqueduct.

321
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,750
This colony exists
because of his sacrifice

322
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,834
and the sacrifice
of thousands of others.

323
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,375
No, we are not leaving.

324
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:32,750
The Sheliak will not accept
humans on their planet

325
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:35,667
and they will not hesitate
to use force to remove you.

326
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:37,542
We'll not be bullied
off our land,

327
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:42,000
not by you,
and not by the Sheliak.

328
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,750
Stubborn<i> and</i> irrational.

329
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:48,500
Now what do we do?

330
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:52,375
Are his sentiments typical
of the colonists?

331
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,542
I hope not.

332
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,375
If I can convince
enough of the people

333
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:57,709
of the necessity of leaving...

334
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't you mean
if<i> we</i> can convince?

335
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,625
Come.

336
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:10,125
Yes, sir.

337
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,333
Three weeks.

338
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,458
Starfleet is profuse
in its apologies,

339
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,750
but it will still
be three weeks...

340
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:20,125
until the arrival
of a colony transport ship

341
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,792
equipped with dedicated
personnel shuttles.

342
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:25,000
We can't wait three weeks.

343
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,709
Then the Sheliak must agree
to extend our deadline.

344
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,333
If they plan to settle
Tau Cygna V

345
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,625
two days from now...

346
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:39,166
One of their ships
must already be en route.

347
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,333
We're going to intercept
that ship.

348
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,291
The Sheliak may interpret that
as a hostile act.

349
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,834
It's a risk
we have to take.

350
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,333
The<i> Enterprise</i> is going

351
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,750
to intercept
the Sheliak colony ship.

352
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:00,250
Now your job...

353
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,166
Well, you know what your job is.

354
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,417
DATA:
Commander,

355
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,709
in human parlance,

356
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,250
I do not believe
I can get the job done.

357
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,166
My training has prepared me
for starship command duties.

358
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,375
As a cultural contact,
I am proving to be

359
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,709
less than exemplary.

360
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,291
What's the situation?

361
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,583
Their leader refuses my counsel.

362
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,000
He denies the logic
of my arguments

363
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,458
and speaks of structures
they have built.

364
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,625
Then try something else.

365
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,208
I have, sir.

366
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,709
In the last three hours
and eight minutes,

367
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,625
I have spoken with 56 colonists.

368
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,208
Ten of those refused to believe
a threat exists.

369
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,291
22 favor staying
and fighting the Sheliak.

370
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:40,375
16 prefer negotiation
or some sort

371
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:41,834
of passive resistance.

372
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,125
Only eight were willing
to consider evacuation

373
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,417
and of those eight...

374
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,709
Data, I can't help you.

375
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,834
I don't know these people.
I haven't talked to them.

376
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,417
You have.

377
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,834
Use that fancy positronic brain
of yours

378
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,834
and carry out your mission.

379
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,709
Sir, if I do not succeed,

380
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,834
how violent is the Sheliak
reaction likely to be?

381
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,959
The treaty is the only thing
that prevented them

382
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,834
from eradicating the colony
the moment they discovered it.

383
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,834
Ah.

384
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,000
"Ah" is right, Data.

385
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,792
The lives of 15,000 people
are riding on you.

386
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,625
You'd better get innovative.

387
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,041
Riker out.

388
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,291
Data?

389
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,125
We're having an effect.

390
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,625
So many people are asking
questions about the Sheliak

391
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,959
that Gosheven has called
a public meeting.

392
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,375
Is there any indication

393
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,000
that Gosheven
has changed his position?

394
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,834
No, but a meeting
will give you a chance

395
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,917
to present your
recommendations.

396
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,750
So far, my attempts
at persuasion

397
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:37,709
have been ineffective.

398
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:49,875
Why did you do that?

399
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:52,166
You appeared to need it.

400
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:58,458
Among humans, a kiss usually
serves to seal a friendship

401
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,834
or indicate support,
attraction, affection.

402
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:07,291
In this context, I must assume
that your intention

403
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,834
was to express support.

404
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,834
You really don't understand
human behavior, do you?

405
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,166
That is something
of an understatement.

406
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,166
Well, sometimes
I don't either.

407
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,041
Androids are a lot
more rational.

408
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,792
Thus far, that quality
has not helped me

409
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:24,458
to accomplish my mission.

410
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
A rational argument
isn't always enough.

411
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,625
Maybe, to be more persuasive,

412
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,500
you need to use a little
reverse psychology.

413
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:39,667
Ah, elicit a desired behavior
by advocating its opposite.

414
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:42,125
That implies deception,
does it not?

415
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,750
A little, but if it helps
us get our point across...

416
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:49,667
Perhaps this is a situation
where excessive honesty

417
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,083
can be detrimental.

418
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,875
Now, how are
we progressing,
Mr. La Forge?

419
00:22:07,917 --> 00:22:09,000
About like you'd expect, sir.

420
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,458
Splendid,
splendid.

421
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Carry on.

422
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:15,125
WESLEY:
He wants the impossible.

423
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:20,291
LA FORGE:
That's the short definition
of "captain."

424
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:39,166
GOSHEVEN:
You've all heard of the android
Starfleet has sent here

425
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,709
and you've been discussing
why he's come.

426
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,792
I called this meeting

427
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:50,667
to replace misinformation
with cold, hard fact.

428
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:54,375
I wish to speak.

429
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,625
No, leave now.

430
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,834
Do you consider
your position so weak

431
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,250
that it cannot
withstand a debate?

432
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,500
Let him speak.

433
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:05,083
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

434
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,125
You all know
of the Sheliak threat.

435
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:24,625
Starfleet wishes to evacuate you
for your own protection.

436
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:29,792
Yet Gosheven
has decided otherwise.

437
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:32,083
That is his right

438
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,291
and I will not waste time
trying to reverse that decision.

439
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:40,166
I admire your conviction
in the face of certain defeat.

440
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:44,125
Though doomed,
your effort will be valiant

441
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,750
and when you die,

442
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:50,333
you will die
for land and for honor.

443
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,583
Your children will understand

444
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:04,125
that they are dying
for a worthy cause.

445
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,542
Long after the battle is over,

446
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:12,000
their courage
will be remembered and extolled.

447
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,792
Remembered by who?

448
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:19,625
Yes, that is true.

449
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,625
There will be no one left alive
to remember.

450
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:26,291
(<i> clapping</i> )

451
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,250
A valiant try, android.

452
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:33,500
But what a low opinion
you must have of us.

453
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:34,792
I was simply attempting

454
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:36,834
to describe
your inevitable destruction

455
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,709
in a manner that would have
an emotional effect.

456
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,083
And he describes it
pretty damn well.

457
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,083
Are you ready to follow
this machine?

458
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,792
Give up without a fight?

459
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:47,125
He says we're going to lose,

460
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:49,792
but I think that's just
his cowardice talking.

461
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:52,041
MAN:
What if he's right
and you're wrong?

462
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:55,041
Shouldn't we consider
that possibility?

463
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,834
This colony exists

464
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:59,583
because generations
gave their lives for it.

465
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,083
Many died

466
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,542
before we found a way
to adapt to the radiation

467
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,917
and many more died
bringing water to this desert.

468
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,375
My grandfather...

469
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:09,750
Is buried on that mountain.

470
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,959
Well, who'll be left
to bury you?

471
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:22,583
Have you considered
what this evacuation means?

472
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:26,750
Everything we have, we abandon.

473
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:30,875
Everything that we have built
turns to dust.

474
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:34,792
Everything that we have
accomplished means nothing.

475
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,750
Well, I say no.

476
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:38,959
You elected me your leader.

477
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,333
Follow me now.

478
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,917
I don't think our chances

479
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,792
are as hopeless as he says,

480
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:50,709
and I'm willing to stake
our lives on it.

481
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,875
Any objections?

482
00:25:57,125 --> 00:26:02,667
Good, because here we stand.

483
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:03,959
Aye.

484
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,417
We stand with you, Gosheven.

485
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:15,250
Then here you die.

486
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,750
Mr. Data, I just
want you to know

487
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,709
that Gosheven doesn't
speak for all of us.

488
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,291
I see no reason
to die needlessly.

489
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,917
And you?

490
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,291
I'm not sure.

491
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,792
Gosheven's done
well for us,

492
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:38,500
but I'd like to
hear more of what
you have to say.

493
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:40,667
There are many others
that feel the same way,

494
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:43,083
but they're very uneasy
about confronting Gosheven.

495
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,709
Get them together
and we'll meet at my house.

496
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:54,583
In our dealings
with other non-humanoid races,

497
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,750
there has always been
some point of reference.

498
00:26:57,792 --> 00:26:59,333
Not so with the Sheliak.

499
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:01,834
But we must have
something in common.

500
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,166
We communicate.

501
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,667
Barely.

502
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:07,875
They have learned several
Federation languages,

503
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,291
but theirs continues
to elude us.

504
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,417
Telepaths?

505
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:16,291
Attempted and failed.

506
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,291
Actually, the fact
that any alien race

507
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:23,417
communicates with another
is quite remarkable.

508
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,959
We are stranded on a planet.

509
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,875
We have no language in common,
but I want to teach you mine.

510
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:33,000
<i>S'smarith.</i>

511
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,709
What did I just say?

512
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,166
Cup?

513
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,667
Glass?

514
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:40,291
Are you sure?

515
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:45,709
I may have meant "liquid,"
"clear," "brown," "hot."

516
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,709
We conceptualize the universe
in relatively the same way.

517
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,083
Point taken.

518
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:59,000
In your talks, you must be
extremely accurate.

519
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:02,834
The treaty is 500,000 words.

520
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:06,125
The length was to accommodate
the Sheliak.

521
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,542
They consider our language
irrational

522
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:11,375
and demanded this level
of complexity

523
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:13,875
to avoid any future
misunderstandings.

524
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:15,667
RIKER:
Captain, we have the vessel

525
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:18,000
carrying the Sheliak colonists
on visual.

526
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,125
On my way.

527
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:23,458
So. It begins.

528
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,583
Hailing frequencies.

529
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,291
Open.

530
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,208
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

531
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,750
Your purpose,<i> Enterprise?</i>

532
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:39,834
We desire face-to-face
negotiations

533
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:43,000
to settle the crisis
on Tau Cygna V.

534
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,125
Meaningless.

535
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:47,000
We are entitled to consultation

536
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:51,375
under paragraph 653,
subparagraph nine.

537
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:54,667
Granted.

538
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,500
Was that
an invitation?

539
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:00,208
I am taking it as such.

540
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,458
Counselor.

541
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,625
You have the Bridge, Number One.

542
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,834
Helm, maintain
relative position.

543
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:08,583
Mr. Worf, tell Transporter
Room 2 to stand by.

544
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,583
Aye, sir.

545
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,834
And once the Federation
resettles us,

546
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,166
we'll be left alone?

547
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,375
If you so desire.

548
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:16,542
We do.

549
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,083
We like to do things
on our own.

550
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:20,083
The Federation will
offer as little

551
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,041
or as much help
as you dictate.

552
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:24,333
Kentor, are you with us?

553
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:29,083
Yes. The question is,
how do we convince Gosheven?

554
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,917
Well, why do we need to?

555
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,333
Because he's respected.

556
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,500
Most people will do
what he says.

557
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,166
They respect you, too.

558
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,000
If you take a stand,
they'll fall in line.

559
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,333
I don't know.

560
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:41,500
Gosheven's got
a lot of supporters.

561
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:43,917
GOSHEVEN:
Don't forget that, Kentor.

562
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,542
I'm disappointed.

563
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:51,125
I thought we'd settled this.

564
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,917
Apparently, that
is not correct.

565
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,709
Still stirring up trouble?

566
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,792
Since when is talk trouble?

567
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,375
It's over.

568
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:08,792
Don't you get it?

569
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:10,583
You had your say.

570
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,166
You lost.

571
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,792
I appear to be reversing
that defeat.

572
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:16,083
No, you're not.

573
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,792
You're just stubborn.

574
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:20,041
Well, let me tell you something.

575
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,500
So am I.

576
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:27,709
Damn you, Gosheven.

577
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,583
You killed him.

578
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,375
I've killed no one.

579
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,083
I merely shut down a machine.

580
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,500
That's it, everyone.

581
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,250
It's time to go home.

582
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,917
You'll see that I'm right.

583
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,917
Advance and speak.

584
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:34,125
Director, we will comply
with your request

585
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:36,750
to remove the colony
from Tau Cygna V,

586
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,291
but we need time.

587
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,750
The given time has elapsed.

588
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,333
We carry the membership

589
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:45,166
and we will proceed
with their debarkation.

590
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:47,458
The temporary presence
of these humans

591
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,458
should not interfere
with your plans.

592
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,667
Unacceptable.

593
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,667
You must remove the creatures.

594
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:55,333
I'm trying, but
the needed ship

595
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:57,291
will not be available
for three weeks.

596
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,750
Then you are in violation.

597
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,667
I have admitted that.

598
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:07,792
I am only asking for
a little flexibility.

599
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:12,083
Section 501, paragraph 716,
subparagraph five.

600
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:16,125
"Unwanted life-forms
inhabiting H-Class worlds

601
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:19,125
may be removed at the discretion
of the Sheliak Corporate."

602
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:21,542
<i>We</i> will remove them,

603
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:24,500
but you must grant us
the time we require.

604
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:27,959
You need time, Picard,
of the<i> Enterprise?</i>

605
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,667
We will save you time.

606
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:33,333
We will eradicate
the human infestation.

607
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,667
They are not vermin.

608
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:36,083
They are citizens
of the Federation.

609
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,625
I will not permit this outrage!

610
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:40,542
Intelligent converse
is impossible.

611
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,291
You do not discuss.

612
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,750
You gibber.

613
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:47,041
Between intelligent
species of good will...

614
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:54,458
I take it the Sheliak
just hung up on us again.

615
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,458
I was afraid
your neural pathways

616
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,458
were scrambled beyond repair.

617
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,792
I am equipped with
diagnostic circuits

618
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:15,458
and am able to correct
many malfunctions.

619
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,709
I'm not surprised
at Gosheven's behavior,

620
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,208
but Kentor and the others

621
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,000
they said they were with us.

622
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,542
I guess words
don't mean very much.

623
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:26,792
Perhaps that is a part
of our difficulty.

624
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:29,500
Words are all
we have been using.

625
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:34,667
Humans seem to take
much stronger notice of actions.

626
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:37,959
I require a phaser.

627
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,583
What's a phaser?

628
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,375
A type of weapon.

629
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,542
Unfortunately,
it does not function

630
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:46,625
in the presence
of hyperonic radiation.

631
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:49,041
I will have to be innovative.

632
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:55,583
Hyperonic radiation
randomizes phaser beams,

633
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,583
but I believe I can improvise
a servocircuit

634
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:01,417
which will compensate

635
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,792
by continuously
recollimating the output.

636
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,625
You're using your own
neural subprocessors

637
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:07,875
to build a smarter phaser.

638
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:09,625
Essentially correct.

639
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,208
Get word to Gosheven.

640
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,250
Tell him I am coming
to the pumping station.

641
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:22,333
Tell him I am going
to destroy the aqueduct.

642
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:26,041
He'll try to stop you.

643
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,542
I sincerely hope so.

644
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,542
Go to yellow alert.

645
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:47,709
Shields up.

646
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,250
Aye, sir.

647
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:51,375
Mr. Riker, put us nose-to-nose
with the Sheliak vessel.

648
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:52,667
Any move she makes,
match it.

649
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:53,750
Aye, sir.

650
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,250
Mr. Worf, hailing frequency.

651
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:58,250
Open.

652
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,875
They're not responding.

653
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:05,834
They don't have to answer.
They just have to listen.

654
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,792
Sheliak vessel...

655
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:09,875
you will have to get past me

656
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:12,834
to get at the colony
on Tau Cygna V.

657
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,333
No response.

658
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,875
Close channel.

659
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,166
And get me that treaty.

660
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:23,792
They've been beating us over
the head with it for three days.

661
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:26,375
Let's see if we can't
find something in it

662
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,917
that we can turn
to our own advantage.

663

(<i> yells</i> )

665
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:05,125
That was the "stun" setting.

666
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,875
This is not.

(<i> all gasping</i> )

668
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:21,542
I can reduce
this pumping station

669

to a pile of debris.

670
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,458
But I trust my point is clear.

671
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,709
I am but one android
with a single weapon.

672
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,583
There are hundreds of Sheliak
on the way

673
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,667
and their weapons
are far more powerful.

674
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:38,375
They may not
offer you a target.

675
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:42,250
They can obliterate you
from orbit.

676
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:48,625
You will die, never having
seen the faces of your killers.

677
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:51,083
The choice is yours.

678
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:56,834
There are other places,
other challenges.

681
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:43,458
I really was willing
to stay here and die for this.

682
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,834
I know that.

683
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:51,250
This is just a thing and

00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:53,375
Lives cannot.

This is hopeless.

686
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,417
Fighting would
be preferable.

687
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,917
That's it.

688
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,500
I don't
follow you, sir.

689
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:29,291
Mr. Worf, get me

690
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,542
Yes, sir.

691
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,375
Coming through, sir.

692
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:47,834
PICARD:
Pursuant to paragraph 1290,

693
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,500
I hereby formally request

694
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:51,917
third party arbitration
of our dispute.

695
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,083
You have the right.

696
00:38:56,125 --> 00:39:00,458
Furthermore,
pursuant to subsection D-3,

697
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,542
I name the Grisellas
to arbitrate.

698
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,000
Grisellas?

699
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,792
Unfortunately,
they are currently

700
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:09,208
in their hibernation cycle.

701
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,208
However, they will awaken
in six months,

702
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,792
at which time we can get
this matter settled.

703
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:21,333
Now, do you want to wait
or give me my three weeks?

704
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,417
Absurd.

705
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:24,333
We carry the membership.

706
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,083
We can brook no delay.

707
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:29,208
Then I hereby declare
this treaty in abeyance.

708
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,917
Wait, negotiation
is permissible...

00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,500
You enjoyed that.

00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,083
Excellent.

721
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:44,041
It'll take 15 years

722
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,458
and a research
team of 100...

723
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,667
Mr. La Forge,
I believe we will postpone.

724
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:51,834
Yes, sir.

725
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,000
Lieutenant Commander Data
to<i> Enterprise.</i>

726
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,375
I am preparing to leave
Tau Cygna V

727
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,750
and await
rendezvous instructions.

728
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,417
WORF:
Acknowledged. Stand by.

729
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,583
Hi.

730
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,834
The evacuation plan
is going well.

731
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,542
When the ship arrives,
we'll be ready to leave.

732
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:27,875
You succeeded.

733
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,417
I could not have succeeded

734
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,500
without your support
and insight.

735
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:34,083
I am grateful
for your assistance.

736
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,375
Good.

737
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:37,000
Then you won't forget me.

738
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,917
I am incapable of forgetting.

739
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:41,959
I will remember every detail
of my visit here

740
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,667
with perfect clarity.

741
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,500
But nothing more?

742
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:49,458
I do not understand.

743
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:57,959
I guess what I really want
to know is...

744
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,709
do you have
any feelings for me?

745
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:07,333
I have no feelings of any kind.

746
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:11,500
No, of course you don't.

747
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,458
What was that for?

748
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,667
You appeared to need it.

749
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:34,375
So you saw that I was unhappy

750
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:38,959
and did what you concluded
would make me feel better?

751
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:45,083
Rational to the last.

752
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:03,583
Bye.

753
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:04,875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

754
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:06,000
Come.

755
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,917
(<i> classical music playing</i> )

756
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:12,667
Welcome home, Mr. Data.

757
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:13,709
Well done.

758
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,750
Thank you, sir.

759
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,917
(<i> music continues</i> )

760
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:20,375
The good doctor was kind
enough to provide me

761
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:22,542
with a recording
of your concert.

762
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:26,750
Your performance
shows... feeling.

763
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:30,208
As I have recently
reminded others, sir

764
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,291
I have no feeling.

765
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,750
That's hard to believe.

766
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:38,417
Your playing is
quite beautiful.

767
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:41,041
Strictly speaking, sir,
it is not<i> my</i> playing.

768
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,917
It is a precise imitation
of the techniques

769
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:46,458
of Jascha Heifetz
and Trenka Bron-ken.

770
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,542
Is there nothing of Data
in what I'm hearing?

771
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:55,458
You see, you chose
the violinists.

772
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,083
Heifetz and Bron-ken have
radically different styles,

773
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:01,125
different techniques,

774
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,041
and yet you combine them

775
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:04,792
successfully.

776
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:10,792
I suppose I have learned
to be creative, sir...

777
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:12,792
when necessary.

778
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:19,291
Mr. Data, I look forward
to your next concert.
