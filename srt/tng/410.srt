1
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:10,375
It's been five months
since Marc's accident.

2
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:13,500
I haven't missed
a single hour of my duties.

3
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:16,583
I've volunteered
for extra time in the nursery.

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,875
My language studies are better
than they've ever been.

5
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:21,375
Somebody else
might have given in

6
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,875
but, uh, I didn't.

7
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:25,583
Given in to what?

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,125
Death is a normal
part of life.

9
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,667
Maybe some of us are
better at facing
that than others.

10
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:34,792
Maybe some of us
aren't facing it at all.

11
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,250
What do you mean?

12
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,000
Recovery
from a great loss

13
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,750
involves a great deal of pain.

14
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,375
If we try to avoid that pain

15
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,709
we can make it harder
on ourselves in the long run.

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,375
But I feel fine.

17
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:53,041
Today would have been
your husband's 38th birthday.

18
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,625
You keep excellent records,
Deanna.

19
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:05,792
Last night, I dreamt Marc
was with me, celebrating.

20
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:10,375
I was so glad that
this nonsense was
finally over.

21
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:12,583
Then I woke up

22
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,542
alone...

23
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:18,333
and I knew that he was dead.

24
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:24,417
For the first time, I knew it.

25
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:28,125
I looked around for anything
that belonged to him...

26
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,417
anything.

27
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,834
I forgot that after the funeral,
I told them to take it all away.

28
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,083
What in the world
was I thinking?

29
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:58,041
They didn't take
<i>everything</i> away.

30
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,583
(<i> music box playing</i> )

31
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,667
How did you know?

32
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,458
(<i> sighing</i> )

33
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,709
(<i> sobbing</i> )

34
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:20,000
...an ancient trail

35
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,792
along the Kabul River
in the Himalayas.

36
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:24,000
It's a wonderful
program.

37
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,333
Will, it would
do you good

38
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,792
to have a little
fresh holodeck air.

39
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:29,542
I think my horsemanship
is a little rusty

40
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,875
for the Himalayas,
but thanks anyway.

41
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:34,583
Nonsense.
We'd program

42
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,583
an appropriately
docile steed...

43
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,125
Captain.

44
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,875
Sensors indicate
a vast field of...

45
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:43,667
Of what, Lieutenant?

46
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,041
It's gone.

47
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,166
But something did appear
directly in our path.

48
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,500
ALLENBY:
Deflector shields
are not encountering

49
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,875
elevated levels
of interstellar matter.

50
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,375
A sensor echo, Data?

51
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:55,709
Uncertain. I have

52
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,125
no unusual readings,
Commander.

53
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:02,250
I promise I'll come by
and see you tomorrow.

54
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,667
Deanna, are you
all right?

55
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,625
What? What?

56
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,667
You faded out there
for a second.

57
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:11,667
Oh, no.

58
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,333
No, I'm fine.

59
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,625
Um, I'm just very tired,
that's all.

60
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:18,458
Will I see you tomorrow?

61
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,959
Tomorrow.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,375
Thank you, Deanna.

63
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,834
Oh...

64
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,834
Oh!

65
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,208
(<i> groaning</i> )

66
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,625
An aggregate field
of plane-polarized objects

67
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,709
has just appeared.

68
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,583
And disappeared.

69
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,208
(<i> groaning</i> )

70
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,625
Recommend we run
a diagnostic

71
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,417
on the forward
sensor array.

72
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,583
We don't want
a ghost tailing us

73
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,208
all the way
to T'lli Beta.

74
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,250
I'm not convinced
it is a ghost.

75
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,000
There may be
something there, Commander.

76
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,625
Ensign Allenby,
full stop.

77
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:03,875
Aye, sir.

78
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:06,125
Let's investigate
both possibilities.

79
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,291
(<i> panting</i> )

80
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:44,375
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

81
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:48,709
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

82
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

<i>to explore</i>

85
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,000
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

86
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,875
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44356.9.</i>

87
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:05,291
<i>Sensor diagnostics</i>
<i>have been completed</i>

88
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,125
<i>and indicate</i>
<i>that all systems are normal.</i>

89
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,208
<i>There remains no explanation</i>
<i>for the images</i>

90
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,041
<i>which appeared in our path.</i>

91
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,291
I have completed
another full scan

92
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,625
of the area, sir.

93
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,709
There is no further
indication of the anomaly.

94
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,166
Ensign, prepare
to resume course

95
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,750
to T'lli Beta.

96
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,208
Mr. Data, what velocity

97
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,208
would put us back
on schedule?

98
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,333
A resumption of
our present course

99
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,667
at warp six
will place us

100
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,834
in the T'lli Beta
system in six days

101
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,125
13 hours,
47 minutes.

102
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,083
What? No seconds?

103
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,834
I have discovered, sir,
a certain level of impatience

104
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,583
when I calculate
a lengthy time interval

105
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,333
to the nearest second.

106
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,291
However, if you wish...

107
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,417
No, no.
Minutes is fine.

108
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,125
Stand ready at warp six, Ensign.

109
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,750
Aye, sir.

110
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,834
Engage.

111
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,750
(<i> alarms blaring</i> )

112
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,792
Riker to Engineering.

113
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,125
Geordi, what the hell happened?

114
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,875
Checking.

115
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:05,583
Looks like the field collapsed
before we could enter warp.

116
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,583
Recommend full stop
while I check it out.

117
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,667
Back to all
stop, Ensign.

118
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:09,667
Aye, sir.

119
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:10,625
All decks reporting.

120
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:11,750
Minor injuries
only, sir.

121
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:12,709
Damage?

122
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,709
None, sir.

123
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,125
Weapons and shields normal.

124
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,709
Go to Yellow Alert.

125
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,375
Captain, we've started
moving again.

126
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,959
Something is pulling us.

127
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:35,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

128
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,250
(<i> beeping</i> )

129
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,333
Troi to Dr. Crusher.

130
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,834
Yes, Deanna?

131
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,166
Beverly...

132
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,333
I'm feeling very dizzy.

133
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,500
Did you hit your head?

134
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,792
I'm not sure.

135
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,125
I'm not sure<i> what</i> happened.

136
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,166
Lie down, breathe deeply
and stay calm.

137
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,750
I'm getting calls
from all over the ship.

138
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,333
I'll be there
as quickly as I can.

139
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,542
New heading confirmed:
025 mark 273.

140
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,000
Speed is holding
at one-tenth impulse.

141
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,000
Whatever is pulling us
sure isn't in a hurry.

142
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,000
Picard to La Forge.

143
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,417
Go ahead, Captain.

144
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,625
Mr. La Forge, if your engines
are functioning

145
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,208
we'll attempt to break free.

146
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,542
Well, everything down here
seems normal enough, sir.

147
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,458
But I suggest we take it
a bit slower this time.

148
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,959
Ensign, bring us around
90 degrees to starboard.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,166
New course laid in
at 90 degrees to starboard.

150
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,291
One-quarter impulse.
Engage.

151
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,667
Aye, sir.

152
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,625
Nothing, Captain.

153
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,417
Speed and course
are unaffected.

154
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,792
One-half impulse.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,834
No change.

156
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,875
Full impulse. Rotate heading in
five-degree increments.

157
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,291
Aye, sir.

158
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,125
La Forge?

159
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,291
There's nothing wrong down here.

160
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,208
The engines are fine.

161
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,667
Integrity field
stress exceeding

162
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,083
82 million kilodynes.

163
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,750
Recommend immediate
shutdown, sir.

164
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:08,208
Make it so, Ensign.

165
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,375
All engines down.

166
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:16,375
We're still
being pulled.

167
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:17,875
Same heading,
same speed.

168
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:26,667
I got here
as quickly as I could.

169
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,458
I've got a Sick Bay
filled with headaches.

170
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,917
How are you?

171
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,083
Well, when I
first called you

172
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,000
I was feeling
<i>intense</i> pain.

173
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,083
Now it's gone

174
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,417
but I'm feeling
a bit foggy.

175
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,166
I'd like to take you
to Sick Bay and run

176
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,834
an inner nuncial
series on you.
Can you walk?

177
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,250
RIKER:
All senior staff report
to the observation lounge.

178
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,333
Are you up to that?

179
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,917
I think so.

180
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,500
What is it?

181
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,792
Nothing.

182
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:58,542
Nothing. I'm fine.

183
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,166
Could it be some sort
of tractor beam?

184
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,750
No other ship is indicated.

185
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,291
Mr. Worf, what is
your analysis?

186
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,875
Tactical sensor
readings are
indeterminate.

187
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,041
They don't even give
us enough

188
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,291
for an educated guess.

189
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,458
And yet all
of our sensors

190
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,834
are operating
properly.

191
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,625
Can there be an intelligence
at work here?

192
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:34,583
Counselor, do you sense
a life-form out there?

193
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,291
No, I don't think so.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,125
No.

195
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,959
There's nothing.

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,125
Nothing.

197
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,792
I sense nothing.

198
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,583
It's all right, Counselor.

199
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,166
Perhaps there's nothing
out there to sense.

200
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,917
DATA:
Indeed,
there are many races

201
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,000
that are not
empathically
detectable.

202
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,875
The Breen,
the Ferengi...

203
00:10:56,917 --> 00:11:01,333
No, you don't understand.

204
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,041
I don't sense anything

205
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,208
not out there, not in here.

206
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,709
All of you

207
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,625
you're all blank to me.

208
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,959
There's no indication
of a concussion

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,083
or a blow to the head.

210
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,709
Just a pattern
of unresponsive
neural cells

211
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,542
throughout the
cerebellum and
cerebral cortex.

212
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,208
Unresponsive?

213
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,125
There's brain damage.

214
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,250
How serious,
I can't tell yet.

215
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,500
But I feel
perfectly fine otherwise.

216
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:39,834
Can you treat it?

217
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,583
I'm not sure.

218
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,917
I have to review
the database

219
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,959
on Betazoid
neural physiology.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,208
The Betazoid brain

221
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,667
has a remarkable ability
to heal itself.

222
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,542
This condition could just
reverse itself in time.

223
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,500
It might, but you
<i>are</i> half-human.

224
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,250
That changes
the map a little.

225
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,291
I don't want to offer
you any false hopes.

226
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,959
It's just hope, Beverly,
not false hope.

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,667
What would cause
something like this?

228
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:06,875
Because it started
at the same time

229
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,709
that we encountered
the anomaly.

230
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,709
There may be
a connection.
I don't know.

231
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,000
If you were anyone else

232
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,625
you know the first
thing I'd do?

233
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,458
I'd send you to
Counselor Troi.

234
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,917
Well, then I have
an advantage, don't I?

235
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,000
I see her quite often.

236
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,583
Deanna, it's no different

237
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,583
than one of us
suddenly going blind.

238
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,875
You don't have
to tell me, Beverly.

239
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:29,458
I understand the psychology.

240
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,834
You may understand it

241
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,667
but you've never had
to live with it.

242
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,291
I may be perfectly
fine tomorrow.

243
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,500
And you may not.

244
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,000
Now, I'll do
my homework.

245
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,458
I'll see what I can do
to regenerate those cells

246
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,000
but in the meantime, I want
you to talk with someone.

247
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,500
There are several
people onboard

248
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,083
who have degrees
in psychology

249
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,333
who are qualified
therapists.

250
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,917
Okay. Fine.

251
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,667
If I need to.

252
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:57,208
Right now, I just want
to go back to work.

253
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,125
Deanna...

254
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,166
If there are no
medical objections?

255
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,834
No medical objections.

256
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,333
Thank you, Beverly.

257
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,834
Will.

258
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,917
(<i> door chimes</i> )

259
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,208
Come in.

260
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,250
I don't have
a psychology degree

261
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,125
but if you'd like to talk...

262
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,834
You know what the worst part
of this is?

263
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,834
And I've seen it happen
to so many patients.

264
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,500
What?

265
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:45,667
The way<i> other people</i> change.

266
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:48,083
How they start
to treat you
differently.

267
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:55,083
They walk on eggshells
around you.

268
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,333
Sometimes
they avoid you altogether.

269
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,375
Sometimes
they become overbearing--

270
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:04,750
reach out a helping hand
to the blind woman.

271
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:05,917
I'm sorry if I...

272
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,750
I will not be treated that way!

273
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,333
Hey!

274
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,709
<i>Imzadi.</i>

275
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,041
Oh, please.

276
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,291
Deanna

277
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,625
I've never seen you
quite so scared.

278
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,291
I'm fine.

279
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,041
If I get better, I get better.

280
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,542
If I don't, I'll adapt.

281
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,041
Life goes on.

282
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,000
Deanna.

283
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,291
I really have to finish this.

284
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,166
I have some appointments
this afternoon.

285
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,375
Probe launch successful.

286
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,709
Telemetry transmissions
are being received.

287
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,208
Okay, let's see
what we've got.

288
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,417
Nothing unusual here.

289
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,000
Same reading
as the ship's sensors.

290
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,959
Expanding analysis
parameters.

291
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,125
Including Bayesian
functions...

292
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,458
broad EM
and subspace spectrum polling.

293
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,792
Hmm-mm.
No change.

294
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:22,125
I am adding virtual
particle trajectories.

295
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,333
Whoa.

296
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,417
What is that?

297
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,834
Unknown.

298
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:38,583
I am attempting
to analyze
motion pattern.

299
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,583
Results still
inconclusive.

300
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,250
Last time I saw
anything that
looked like that

301
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:47,667
I was skin-diving
off the coral
reefs at Bracas V.

302
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:51,083
You said you woke
up a new woman
this morning.

303
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,792
That's how I feel.

304
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:56,166
Tell me about her,
this new woman.

305
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,375
She's, uh, not holding
anything back anymore.

306
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,458
She's not?

307
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,667
Oh, I let it all out
last night.

308
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:06,417
I cried for two hours.

309
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,959
I realized
that I had never accepted

310
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,542
the loss of my husband.

311
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,166
I worked hard,
I kept busy.

312
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,333
I did everything to pretend
it never happened.

313
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,375
And you feel
different now?

314
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:19,917
Completely.

315
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,000
Can I share something
important with you?

316
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,291
Of course.

317
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:32,458
I've temporarily lost
my empathic sense.

318
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,875
It's kind of like having
one hand tied behind your back.

319
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:39,125
I'm so sorry.

320
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,208
Do you want me
to come back?

321
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,709
No, no, I'm fine.

322
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,000
It's just... I feel
before we continue

323
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,208
it's important that
you know that, okay?

324
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,750
All right.

325
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,917
Because I can't tell
how you're feeling this morning.

326
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,667
But it seems to me
that one night of crying

327
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:01,000
can't make up
for months of denial.

328
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,834
No, you're wrong.

329
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,917
I feel better today
than I have in ages.

330
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,750
You're absolutely
wrong, Deanna.

331
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,417
The probe's point of view
reveals that the objects exist

332
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,750
entirely in two dimensions
on a single plane.

333
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,834
They have length and width,
but not height.

334
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,375
Virtually flat.

335
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:29,125
That is why
the ship's forward sensors

336
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,208
did not detect them initially.

337
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,375
We were looking at them
along their edge.

338
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,792
There was no surface to read.
I will illustrate.

339
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,875
Are they a life-form?

340
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:00,458
The movement pattern
within the cluster

341
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,625
is not a naturally
occurring phenomenon

342
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,750
in the Newtonian sense.

343
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,625
They appear to be alive.

344
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,458
Can you explain why they're
pulling us along with them?

345
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,750
Somehow they're
able to polarize

346
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,250
the graviton field
as they move about.

347
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,709
We're caught in the wake.

348
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,917
How do we get out of it?

349
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:19,375
The best idea
for now is to try

350
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,417
a controlled overload
of the warp drive.

351
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,417
Jump directly to warp six.

352
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,166
The laws of a three-dimensional
universe say it should work.

353
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,166
Don't know about
a two-dimensional
universe, though.

354
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,917
Fascinating.

355
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:40,333
So many questions.

356
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,041
How can a two-dimensional
entity have access

357
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,250
to a three-dimensional
universe?

358
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,834
And are they aware of us?

359
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:52,667
Number One, if we can
put off the T'lli Betans

360
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:54,583
I would like
to investigate this further

361
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,875
as soon as we are free
of the graviton field.

362
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,750
It's a shame
we can't tell
if they're sentient.

363
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,250
What do you mean by that?

364
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,875
I'm doing the best that I can.

365
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,625
No one suggested otherwise,
Counselor.

366
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,667
Mr. Data,
try to isolate

367
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:13,333
any signal patterns
from the cluster.

368
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,542
Perhaps there'll be
a basis for communication.

369
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
Mr. La Forge, we'll
attempt your warp jump

370
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:18,417
as soon as you're prepared.

371
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,625
That will be all.

372
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,417
Counselor...

373
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,083
How are you feeling?

374
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,291
Beverly, I can't
do my job.

375
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,583
I'm absolutely lost.

376
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,333
You have to do something.

377
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,125
I cross-referenced
your scan results

378
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,500
with the baseline files
in the computer.

379
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,583
Nothing helpful
has turned up.

380
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,125
And so far,
the lab work
is inconclusive.

381
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,250
Inconclusive?
What does that mean?

382
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,125
It means there is nothing
I can do now.

383
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,417
I am still trying.

384
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:01,750
How do you people
live like this?

385
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,959
We get by pretty
well, actually

386
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,875
and so will you, in time.

387
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:09,458
You have no idea-- no idea--
what this is like.

388
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,667
How can you know
what it's like

389
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,375
to lose something
you never had?

390
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:13,542
I don't claim to.

391
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,750
And yet you're telling me

392
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:17,583
that I'm supposed
to get used to it.

393
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,041
If our positions
were reversed

394
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,542
what would you tell me?

395
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,875
If our positions
were reversed

396
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,750
I wouldn't have been in here
treating skinned elbows

397
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,875
while you were lying passed out
on your office floor.

398
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,375
I'd have been there
a lot sooner

399
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:34,208
perhaps in time to prevent this
from ever happening!

400
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,375
I've been working
with Ensign Brooks

401
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:16,542
since the death of her husband.

402
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,333
She's avoided the reality
of what happened

403
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,917
denied it to herself.

404
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,500
And I realize I've been doing

405
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:26,792
the same thing
about my condition.

406
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,333
It's perfectly understandable.

407
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:32,250
It's time I accept
the truth, Captain

408
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,041
and resign as Ship's Counselor.

409
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,375
Resign?

410
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:37,500
I can no longer
fulfill

411
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:38,500
my obligations.

412
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:39,959
What other option is there?

413
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,291
Deanna...

414
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,917
I've been fortunate

415
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,125
to have access
to your Betazoid abilities.

416
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,542
Most starship Captains

417
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,750
have to be content
with a human Counselor.

418
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:04,625
Empathic awareness

419
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,500
is not a requirement
of your position.

420
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:09,125
It is for me.

421
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,667
I'm sure that
after a while

422
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:12,208
you'll be able
to adjust.

423
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,250
They say when one loses a sense

424
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,542
the other senses become stronger
to compensate.

425
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,917
A blind man develops

426
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,000
better hearing...

427
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,000
With all due respect,
Captain

428
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,667
you don't know
what you're talking about.

429
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:28,333
That is a common belief
with no scientific basis

430
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,542
no doubt created
by normal people

431
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:34,583
who felt uncomfortable
around the disabled.

432
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,500
I am disabled

433
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,208
and I'm telling you
I cannot perform my duties.

434
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,083
There was a teacher of
mine at the Academy

435
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,291
who had been confined
to a wheelchair from birth.

436
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:57,959
She was a woman...
Captain, spare me
the inspirational anecdote

437
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,125
and just accept
my resignation.

438
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

439
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:20,500
Come in.

440
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,875
I really would rather
be alone right now.

441
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:32,542
Too bad.

442
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,125
(<i> sobbing</i> )

443
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,500
Shh...

444
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,959
Is this how you handle
all your personnel problems?

445
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,875
Sure.

446
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,333
You'd be surprised how far a hug
goes

447
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,041
with Geordi or Worf.

448
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,834
(<i> laughs</i> )

449
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,125
Will...

450
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,166
I don't know what to do.

451
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:18,375
So, you resign?

452
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,792
You walk away from
all the people who
care about you?

453
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:28,291
I look around me,
and all I see

454
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:32,166
are surfaces
without depth...

455
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,583
colorless, hollow.

456
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:38,542
Nothing seems real.

457
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,625
I'm real.

458
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,875
No, you're not.

459
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:43,792
You're a projection

460
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:45,583
with no more substance
to me

461
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,083
than a character
on the holodeck.

462
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:51,125
I don't believe that.

463
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:55,875
You have no idea
how frightening it is

464
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:59,917
to... to just be here,
without sensing you

465
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:03,000
without sharing
your feelings.

466
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:06,000
(<i> sobbing continues</i> )

467
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,375
That's it, isn't it?

468
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,917
We're on equal
footing now.

469
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,000
What?

470
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,583
You always had
an advantage--

471
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:20,792
a little bit of control
of every situation.

472
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:22,875
That must have been
a very safe position to be in.

473
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:29,417
To be honest...

474
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:32,375
I'd always thought
there was something
a little too...

475
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:35,709
aristocratic about
your Betazoid heritage.

476
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,917
As if your human side
wasn't quite good
enough for you.

477
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,208
That isn't true.

478
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,583
Isn't it?

479
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,542
La Forge to Riker.

480
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,041
Go ahead, Geordi.

481
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:49,792
We are ready to attempt

482
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:52,083
a controlled overload jump
to warp six.

483
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,166
Acknowledged. I'm on
my way to the Bridge.

484
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,291
I'll check in
on you later.

485
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,041
Really, you don't have to.

486
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,959
I will check in
on you later.

487
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,959
(<i> sobbing</i> )

488
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,333
Setting new course
at optimal shearing angle--

00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:30,000
bearing 217 mark 203.

490
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:32,417
Engaging impulse engines now.

491
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,375
Mr. La Forge,
go to warp.

492
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:41,250
Aye, sir.

493
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,208
Status?

494
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,667
Unchanged.

495
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:46,083
We have not broken free
of the graviton field.

496
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:49,500
Integrity field pressure
has increased by 217%, Captain.

497
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,917

Engines disengaged, sir.

504
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:04,333
Report, La Forge.

505
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,250
The energy we wanted
to transfer to the nacelles

506
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,709
was absorbed
by the graviton wake instead.

507
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,625
It set up a torsional wave that
rebounded back to the ship.

508
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,834
We're lucky the hull
is still in one piece.

509
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:16,667
This little nuisance
is beginning to lose
its fascination.

510
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:19,208
Sir, during our attempt
to break away

511
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,792
I recorded
a momentary alteration

512
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:23,166
in the movement pattern
within the cluster.

513
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,458
Do you think we got
their attention, Data?

514
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,291
Perhaps,
but just for an instant.

515
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,583
The pattern immediately returned
to its previous dynamic.

516
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:36,041
Follow up on
it, Mr. Data.

517
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,458
Input your observations
into the universal translator.

518
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,583
Aye, sir.

519
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,125
Perhaps these movements,
themselves

520
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,792
are an attempt
at communication.

521
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,208
(<i> quiet conversations</i> )

522
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:57,625
More tea?

523
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:58,834
I didn't mean
to startle you.

524
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,250
(<i> sighs</i> )

525
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:02,208
That's all right.

526
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,500
I'm getting used to it.

527
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:05,542
May I?

528
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,125
Sure.

529
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,667
Are you really
getting used to it?

530
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,959
No.

531
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,542
Do you want to
talk about it?

532
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:22,500
No.

533
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:24,083
Good.

534
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,875
I get so tired of
people coming in
with their problems.

535
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,875
They come in, they want
a shoulder to cry on

536
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:32,500
and generally,
it turns out
to be mine.

537
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,542
You'd make a good Counselor.

538
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,250
I think so, too

539
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:39,000
so I'm going to talk
to Picard about it.

540
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:41,834
About what?

541
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,917
You becoming Counselor?

542
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,875
Well, yes. You're leaving.

543
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:48,875
That means there won't
be a Counselor onboard

544
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:52,792
and I suppose I'll have a
very long line at that bar.

545
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:56,959
It would be nice to have
a nice office, too.

546
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,625
It's more than just letting them
cry on your shoulder.

547
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:04,667
It takes an enormous commitment.

548
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,834
I can do that.

549
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,750
Guinan, people come
to talk to you

550
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:12,875
about things they<i> want</i>
to reveal.

551
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,208
As Ship's Counselor

552
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,667
you have to get them
to talk about things

553
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:18,125
they<i> don't</i> want
to reveal.

554
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,375
I could do that, too.

555
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:21,750
What are you...?

556
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,375
You don't really want
to be Ship's Counselor.

557
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,625
What would make you say that?

558
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,375
I just know you're not serious.

559
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:37,041
Have I given you any indication
that I might not be serious?

560
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,208
Not really, but...

561
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,375
Then how do you know?

562
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:44,041
Are your empathic abilities
coming back?

563
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:47,000
No.

564
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:49,834
I suppose it's just instinctive.

565
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:52,250
Oh.

566
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,250
I get it.

567
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:55,625
You're trying to make me see

568
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:59,083
that I have other abilities
to draw on--

569
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,792
human intuition

570
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:03,250
instincts.

571
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:06,041
Guinan, those skills
only develop

572
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,166
after years of experience.

573
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,625
It's not that easy.

574
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:15,208
No one said it was easy.

575
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,041
It's much harder than you think.

576
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:23,375
Human intuition and instinct
are not always right

577
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,417
but they do make
life interesting.

578
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:31,083
So I'm discovering.

579
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:47,792
Problem, Data?

580
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,291
Yes, Commander.

581
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,500
Sensors are detecting

582
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:53,125
highly-accelerated
interstellar gases.

583
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,208
Suggesting?

584
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,583
Uncertain, sir.

585
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,709
The phenomenon
is within visual range.

586
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,875
On screen.

587
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:02,083
Magnify.

588
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:06,959
DATA:
It appears to be
a cosmic string fragment

589
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,375
only 107 kilometers long.

590
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,792
A cosmic string?

591
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,542
No wider than a proton

592
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:17,583
but with gravitational
fields as powerful
as a black hole.

593
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,250
The two-dimensional beings
seem to be caught

594
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,333
in the gravitational pull
of the string

595
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:24,333
Their course is taking
them directly toward it.

596
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,000
And us right along with it.

597
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,083
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44359.5.</i>

598
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:38,375
<i>What began</i>
<i>as a curious inconvenience</i>

599
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:40,750
<i>has turned into</i>
<i>a serious threat.</i>

600
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,792
<i>At current speed,</i>
<i>the two-dimensional beings</i>

601
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,709
<i>and the</i> Enterprise
<i>will be drawn into</i>

602
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,375
<i>the cosmic string fragment</i>
<i>in seven hours.</i>

603
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,083
The entities offer
no indication

604
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,333
they are aware of the
string fragment, sir.

605
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,834
Their course and speed
remain constant.

606
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,291
Sir, I recommend we fire

607
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:00,125
a spread of photon torpedoes
into their field.

608
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:01,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

609
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,792
Must we destroy them
to save ourselves?

610
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:10,375
It is unclear what effect
a photon torpedo would have

611
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:12,583
on two-dimensional beings, sir.

612
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:14,166
Nevertheless...

613
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,959
Well, we wouldn't
necessarily have
to fire<i> at</i> them.

614
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,458
Half a dozen photon torpedo
bursts directly in their path

615
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,667
could make them
change course.

616
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:24,083
Make it so.

617
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,166
Torpedoes armed.

618
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:28,834
Fire distribution set.

619
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,917
Detonation at seven
kilometers ahead
of the cluster.

620
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,375
Data, launch another probe.

621
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,667
Patch the monitor through
to the main viewer.

622
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:37,333
Probe is launched.

623
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,750
On screen.

624
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,375
Proceed, Mr. Worf.

625
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:47,291
Launching torpedoes.

626
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,583
Detonation in five seconds.

627
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:53,125
Three... two... one.

628
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,333
(<i> explosions</i> )

629
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:58,917
There is no change
in the graviton field.

630
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:00,667
The torpedoes are having
no effect, sir.

631
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:08,917
Fire another volley directly
into their field, Mr. Worf.

632
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,250
Launching torpedoes.

633
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,959
Detonation
in five seconds.

634
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,166
Three... two... one.

635
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:23,875
(<i> explosions</i> )

636
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,291
DATA:
Matter-antimatter
explosions

637
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,083
appear to be
ineffective, sir.

638
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:45,875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

639
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,000
Come in.

640
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,709
Janet.

641
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,083
Oh, I'm sorry.

642
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:55,166
I meant to cancel
your appointment today.

643
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:59,375
Actually, I'm resigning
as Ship's Counselor.

644
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:00,417
Why?

645
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:01,709
I think it was
fairly clear

646
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,166
during your
last appointment.

647
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,709
It was obviously
non-productive.

648
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,250
I couldn't sense
what you were feeling.

649
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:13,542
Deanna, you were right
about me.

650
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:17,125
I had to go back
and look at what I was doing

651
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:20,417
see why I was trying
to convince myself<i> and</i> you

652
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,417
that I was a new woman.

653
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,709
You made me realize

654
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,875
I was doing exactly
the same thing to myself

655
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:27,458
as I was before--

656
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,667
trying to hide
from the pain.

657
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:35,125
Maybe you couldn't sense
what I was feeling

658
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:37,250
but you helped.

659
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:44,542
(<i> door chimes</i> )

660
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,917
Come.

661
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,000
You wanted
to see me, Captain.

662
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,000
Yes, Counselor.

663
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:55,709
Sit down, please.

664
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,917
Our situation has
become critical.

665
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:05,542
The cluster remains
completely unresponsive.

666
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,208
We have not been able
to alter its course

667
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,792
towards the cosmic
string fragment.

668
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:12,083
How much time do we have?

669
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:15,375
Less than five hours.

670
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:18,125
Which is why I have called you.

671
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,250
Sir?

672
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,458
All that remains

673
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,875
is the possibility
of communication.

674
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:25,417
There might be some way

675
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,792
that we can warn them
of their impending destruction.

676
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:33,000
I thought Data had already tried
to establish communications

677
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:35,333
through
the universal translator.

678
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,000
He has tried
every technical means

679
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,625
at our disposal to reach them.

680
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,375
I wish I knew
how to help, Captain

681
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:44,000
but under
the circumstances...

682
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,667
If there is a psychology
to these creatures

683
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:47,083
we must discover it.

684
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,208
If there is an explanation
for their behavior

685
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,125
we must know what it is.

686
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,083
Even in your current condition

687
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,417
you are
the most qualified person

688
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:58,583
aboard this ship to assist.

689
00:35:58,625 --> 00:35:59,792
Data is in observation

690
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:01,166
attempting to formulate
a strategy.

691
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,834
I want you to join him.

692
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,250
Deanna

693
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,166
we need you.

694
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,291
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

695
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:23,500
<i>If our speed</i>
<i>and course remain unchanged</i>

696
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:26,041
<i>in one hour, the</i> Enterprise
<i>will be torn apart</i>

697
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:29,041
<i>by the gravitational forces</i>
<i>of the cosmic string fragment.</i>

698
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:36,041
Are your signals
reaching them?

699
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,208
Possibly.

700
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,792
However, the beings may
perceive them

701
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:40,250
as negligible noise,
rather than

702
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:43,250
an attempt
at communication.

703
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:46,125
Is there any evidence at all
that they're sentient?

704
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:48,500
Negative. The nature
of their movements

705
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,959
suggests a simple order
of intelligence.

706
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,125
I'm sorry, Data.

707
00:36:57,166 --> 00:37:00,750
I don't seem to be
much help without my
empathic abilities.

708
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:06,083
I just don't know
how to draw on
my human instinct.

709
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,500
As I do not have
human instinct, per se

710
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,083
I cannot advise you,
Counselor.

711
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:15,667
Right now

712
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:20,125
I feel as two-dimensional
as our friends out there.

713
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:25,458
<i>In</i> the universe,
but barely aware of it.

714
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,333
Just trying to survive...

715
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,417
on instinct.

716
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,458
Data...

717
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,333
what if they're simply
acting instinctively?

718
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,792
There are inherent

719
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:46,250
inborn forces in every species.

720
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,250
What they need

721
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:51,041
what they fear.

722
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:55,667
We have to discover
what drives this species.

723
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:56,875
I do not believe
there is any way

724
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:59,125
we can know
for certain, Counselor.

725
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:02,792
We can speculate
on the available evidence.

726
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,750
The only evidence
we have at present

727
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:06,750
is the brief interruption
in their movement pattern

728
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:08,750
during our last attempt
to break away.

729
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:11,792
Which may suggest some kind
of awareness of our presence.

730
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,583
Otherwise, their course
and speed have been constant.

731
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

732
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,792
On a straight line
to the cosmic string.

733
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:26,083
You're convinced the
string's gravitation
is pulling them in?

734
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,041
Because the cluster
is two-dimensional

735
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,917
I do not have
enough direct evidence

736
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,792
to support that assumption.

737
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:36,917
However, it is the most
reasonable hypothesis.

738
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,333
Why?

739
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,041
It is unlikely
they would intentionally move

740
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:43,125
toward a destructive force.

741
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:45,417
Moths fly toward a flame.

742
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:48,709
Horses sometimes run
into a burning barn.

743
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,583
Data, don't you see?

744
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,667
We've been thinking
in three dimensions.

745
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,417
We have to get two-dimensional.

746
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,458
Pardon me?

747
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,959
Subspace signals,
photon torpedoes--

748
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
nothing's had an impact.

749
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:07,709
It's reasonable to wonder
if a gravitational pull--

750
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,333
even as strong
as a cosmic string's--

751
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:12,875
would affect them.

752
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,500
Please continue.

753
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:18,625
What if they've<i> chosen</i>
a course to the cosmic string?

754
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,542
A case
of pure stimulus response.

755
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:22,917
Driven by instinct,

756
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:27,041
just like the moth
to a flame.

757
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:30,000
DATA:
If Counselor Troi's
supposition is correct

758
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:32,375
a replica of the string
projected behind the cluster

759
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,625
could induce them
to reverse course

760
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:37,667
disrupting the graviton wake
long enough for us to escape.

761
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,166
How do you simulate
a cosmic string?

762
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:43,667
It has the gravitational
force of a hundred stars.

763
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:45,166
I do not suggest
simulating

764
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,709
the gravitational field
of the string fragment.

765
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,500
Rather, the string's
vibration.

766
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:52,000
Vibration? We're not talking
about a violin, Data.

767
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,542
No, Data's right.

768
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:55,208
The principle is still the same.

769
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,542
A cosmic string emanates

770
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,375
a characteristic set
of subspace frequencies

771
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:00,875
as atomic particles decay
along its event horizon.

772
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,500
I could use
the ship's parabolic dish

773
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:04,291
to amplify and reflect
those frequencies

774
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:05,458
back toward
the cluster.

775
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,625
The<i> Enterprise,</i> itself,

776
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,625
would echo the
cosmic string.

777
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,542
How much time do
we have, Mr. Worf?

778
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,834
23 minutes, sir.

779
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,041
Make it so.

780
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:23,291
Frequency scan detectors
engaged.

781
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,750
LA FORGE:
Receiving.

782
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:26,125
(<i> loud static</i> )

783
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:27,375
Data, we're picking up
frequencies

784
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:28,959
across the entire
electromagnetic

785
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,875
and lower subspace spectrum.

786
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:34,750
Trying to isolate.

787
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:37,041
Data, can you focus
the reflector field for me?

788
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,917
Stand by.

789
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:43,041
I am differentiating particle
emission signatures now.

790
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,458
(<i> signal clearing</i> )

791
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,000
Good.
Good. That's doing it.

792
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:48,417
Patterns are converging.

793
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:54,375
Same course,
same speed.

794
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,875
No change, sir.

795
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:57,166
WORF:
We're beginning
to encounter

796
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:59,375
the gravitational effects
of the string.

797
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,875
Impact is in
four minutes.

798
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,625
Sir, sheer force turbulence
is impairing our ability

799
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:07,000
to create
an accurate simulation.

800
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,500
Geordi, fire up
the impulse engines.

801
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:10,959
Activate the ship's stabilizers.

802
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,959
Stabilizers on.

803
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,166
Electromagnetic and
subspace wave fronts

804
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:16,750
approaching
synchronization.

805
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:23,875
Three minutes to impact.

806
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,458
Status.

807
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,750
The cluster
is unaffected.

808
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:29,250
Same course,
same speed.

809
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,583
Let's try
turning up the volume.

810
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,041
Increase the intensity,
Mr. Data.

811
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:35,625
Increasing by 50%.

812
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,500
They're slowing.

813
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:47,125
Graviton wake field
<i>is</i> collapsing.

814
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,250
Mr. La Forge,
get us out of here.

815
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,917
With pleasure, sir.

816
00:41:57,125 --> 00:42:00,166
The beings have resumed
their course into the string.

817
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,750
Three seconds
to impact.

818
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:04,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

819
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:17,792
It's all right.

820
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:20,291
They're home.

821
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,000
We were wrong.

822
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:24,041
The cosmic string
was never dangerous to them.

823
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:29,333
It was the one place in the
galaxy they most wanted to be.

824
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,750
Deanna?

825
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,792
Yes...

826
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:36,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

827
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,542
I sensed it.

828
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:50,375
Such overwhelming intensity
of emotion.

829
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:52,458
When we first encountered them,
it must have been more

830
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,583
than my senses
could process.

831
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,166
A short circuit.

832
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:58,709
Something like that.

833
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,166
Oh, Beverly...

834
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:02,291
Apology accepted.

835
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,250
Therapists are always
the worst patients.

836
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,917
Except for doctors, of course.

837
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,750
Come by and see me
at my office later, okay?

838
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:17,417
I was so awful
to her.

839
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:20,792
Well, you were just being human.

840
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:23,667
I never fully appreciated
how difficult--

841
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:27,542
and how rewarding it is--
to be human.

842
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:30,000
But I had a lot of help.

843
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,875
Thanks.

844
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:36,792
Now, is that Counselor position
still open aboard ship?

845
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:38,750
It's been taken.

846
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:40,542
I just thought I'd ask.

847
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,041
Better hours.

848
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,375
Excuse me.

849
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,917
And you...

850
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,291
Thank you for making me face
my other half.

851
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:53,041
Frightening, wasn't it?

852
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:55,166
A little.

853
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:56,750
You were right, though.

854
00:43:56,792 --> 00:43:58,125
There is something
to be learned

855
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:02,208
when you're not in control
of every situation.

856
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,917
Welcome to the human race.

857
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:07,375
By the way,
the next time

858
00:44:07,417 --> 00:44:10,041
you call me
"aristocratic..."
