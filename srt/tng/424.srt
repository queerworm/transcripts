00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:07,208
<i>Stardate 44885.5.</i>

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,875
<i>I am en route</i>
<i>to the planet Risa</i>

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,166
<i>to attend an artificial</i>
<i>intelligence seminar.</i>

5
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,500
<i>Captain Picard has ordered me</i>
<i>to arrive a few days early</i>

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,458
<i>to have some fun and relax.</i>

7
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:19,083
<i>I intend to follow</i>
<i>his orders to the very</i>
<i>best of my ability.</i>

8
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,500
(<i> classical music playing</i> )

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,959
How about
some different music, Computer?

10
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:25,792
Something with a Latin beat.

11
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,417
(<i> Latin jazz playing</i> )

12
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:30,000
No, I meant something
with a<i> gentle</i> Latin beat.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,959
Maybe a... a Spanish guitar.

14
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,709
(<i> guitar playing</i> )

15
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,583
(<i> sighs</i> )

16
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,041
Perfect.

17
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,583
Hey, what's the weather like
on Risa?

18
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:46,333
COMPUTER:
Risa is climate controlled
for optimum tourist comfort.

19
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,083
Is that right?

20
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,542
And about how long
till we get there?

21
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:53,250
Arrival at Risa is scheduled
for 0932 hours.

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,458
Ooh, three hours.

23
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:01,917
How about a game, Computer?

24
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:03,792
Please restate request.

25
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:06,458
Something to pass the time.
You know, a diversion.

26
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,834
Select either visual interactive
or verbal interactive.

27
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:12,333
Hmm... verbal.

28
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,709
You have 20 seconds to respond
to each question.

29
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,583
Level of difficulty
will increase as you progress.

30
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,834
Proceed when ready.

31
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:20,291
Begin.

32
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,125
List the resonances
of the sub-quantum states

33
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,709
associated with
transitional relativity...

34
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:26,709
That's easy.

35
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:29,333
...in alphabetical order.

36
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,250
Uh... well, uh...

37
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,542
a-asymmetrical...

38
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,792
uh, uh, uh, inverted...

39
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,417
um... uh, uh...

40
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:39,917
phased...

41
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:42,709
uh, stable...

42
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,500
Your time has expired.

43
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,917
(<i> groans</i> )

44
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,250
The fifth resonance is...

45
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,750
BOTH:
Universal.

46
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,959
I knew that.

47
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,834
Okay, okay.
Give me another one.

48
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:55,750
List the field patterns
associated with warp modulation

49
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,458
in order of decreasing energy.

50
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,166
Oh, okay. There's the aft
nacelle associative

51
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,542
the for...

52
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:05,166
Ho! Computer

53
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,291
sequence 0-1-0,
maximum power to the shields.

54
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,750
Kill the music.

55
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,083
<i>Enterprise,</i>
this is Shuttle Seven.

56
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,583
I've encountered
a Romulan warbird.

57
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,250
Coordinates are three...

58
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,750
COMPUTER:
Warning, shield failure.

59
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,166
Damn!

60
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,667
Risa Control.

61
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,125
Anybody!

62
00:02:56,291 --> 00:03:00,875
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

63
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:05,166
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

64
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,709
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

65
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,500
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

66
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,083
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

67
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,291
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

68
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,458
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44891.6.</i>

69
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,625
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has</i>
<i>been ordered to accompany</i>
<i>a special emissary</i>

70
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:27,417
<i>from the Klingon High Council</i>
<i>to the Kriosian system</i>

71
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:31,125
<i>where one of their colonies</i>
<i>is fighting for independence.</i>

72
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:35,000
There was a time when the Empire
would crush a rebellion.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,875
Now it is tolerated.

74
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,333
We have enough troubles
on the home planet

75
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,959
so we don't wish
to divert resources

76
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,291
to such a trivial war.

77
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,834
You're preparing
to grant them independence?

78
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:47,250
Well, perhaps.

79
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,250
Conquer them again later,
if we wish.

80
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,000
PICARD:
May I ask,
Ambassador

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,333
what has this to do with us?

82
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,959
The Governor of Krios
has charged

83
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,792
that the Federation
is secretly aiding the rebels.

84
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,959
Does he have evidence?

85
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,000
The Council
has sent me here

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,667
to examine
that evidence.

87
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:08,333
It was<i> my</i> decision to invite you
to accompany me, Captain.

88
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,625
Many on the Council
have great respect for you.

89
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,417
<i>K'adlo.</i>

90
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:16,208
I have been pleased
to offer occasional assistance

91
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,291
to the Klingon people
in the past.

92
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,083
Your modesty is
very human, Captain.

93
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,041
I will excuse it.

94
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,208
But I can assure you,
Ambassador

95
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,333
that the Federation
would never interfere

96
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,333
in the internal affairs
of the Empire.

97
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,875
Let us hope not.

98
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,125
Such interference would strike

99
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,083
at the very basis
of our alliance.

100
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:38,000
Captain, we<i> are</i> in the war zone.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,417
Indeed.

102
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,834
Ambassador, I will ask
our Chief Security Officer

103
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,375
Lieutenant Worf,
to make a report...

104
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,834
Uh, Captain

105
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:49,041
Worf's discommendation
makes that very awkward.

106
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,166
If I could work with one of
the other security officers...

107
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,625
Lieutenant Worf<i> is</i>
my Chief of Security

108
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,166
and my Tactical Officer.

109
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,333
This matter clearly falls
within his jurisdiction.

110
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,166
As you wish.

111
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,375
(<i> grunts</i> )

112
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,458
(<i> door closes</i> )

113
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,208
Hey, hey,<i> hey!</i>

114
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,166
Hey, take it easy.

115
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,500
Hey!

116
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,125
(<i> grunts</i> )

117
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,125
Welcome, Mr. La Forge.

118
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,959
We've waited a long
time to meet you.

119
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,458
I can tell you've gone
to a lot of trouble.

120
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,709
Indeed, we have.

121
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:40,834
You are going to be
of great help to us.

122
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,417
Oh, I wouldn't
count on it.

123
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,625
Good. Very good.

124
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,166
Do not enjoy yourself
<i>too much</i> on Risa.

125
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,250
Hey!

126
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,333
Your VISOR
will be returned to you

127
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,792
but first, I want
to show you something.

128
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,500
Show me something?

129
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,750
That'll be a nice trick

130
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,291
seeing as how
I can't see anything

131
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,792
without the VISOR.

132
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,083
That is not quite true.

133
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,792
(<i> groaning</i> )

134
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,417
Allow me to demonstrate.

135
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:38,792
I now have direct access
to his visual cortex.

136
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:43,542
He has no choice but to see
what I wish him to see.

137
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,250
I can feed him
any image I choose.

138
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,750
He will be unable
to ignore it.

139
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,667
His galvanic skin response
has increased nine percent.

140
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:53,959
It seems Commander La Forge

141
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,083
like many humans,
has a low tolerance

142
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,792
for watching
others suffer.

143
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,959
(<i> groans</i> )

144
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,000
Why are you doing this?

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,667
I am sorry,
Commander.

146
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,333
It is a necessary step.

147
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,625
I apologize
for your discomfort.

148
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,917
Here.

149
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,709
Observe
how a spring day

150
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:15,208
on his native Earth
affects him.

151
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,125
He's looking
at a beautiful meadow--

152
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,000
green trees, birds,
a blue sky.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,500
The heartbeat slows.

154
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,333
The galvanic skin
response drops.

155
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,542
The body responds
to our stimuli.

156
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:27,917
He is incapable

157
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:31,083
of maintaining control
of his own responses.

158
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,917
Watch as I change
the stimuli again.

159
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,542
Once our work is done,
La Forge will act normally

160
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:41,917
totally unaware
of his conditioning--

161
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,959
the perfect tool
for our purpose.

162
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:45,333
Will there be
any physical evidence

163
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,208
of what you're going
to do to him?

164
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,709
None, Commander.

165
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:50,458
That is why we chose La Forge.

166
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,792
The utilization of his
pre-existing neural implants

167
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:56,291
makes our work
impossible to detect.

168
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,333
How will we be certain your
procedure has been successful?

169
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:03,166
I will program him to perform
a series of specific tests

170
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,458
both before he leaves us

171
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,041
and after he returns
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

172
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,250
We'll be able to verify
his effectiveness.

173
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,625
Notice that his heart rate
has slowed somewhat.

174
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,208
He is becoming
accustomed

175
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,583
to the horrors
he is witnessing.

176
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,500
So...

177
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,583
(<i> grunts</i> )

178
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,583
we change horrors.

179
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,625
(<i> gasping</i> )

180
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:32,375
(<i> screaming</i> )

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,959
There have been
two rebel attacks

182
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,625
on neutral freighters--

183
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,333
one the Ferengi,
and the other Cardassian.

184
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,417
Both were engaged
near the Ikanian asteroid belt.

185
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:50,709
That's where the
rebels must be hiding.

186
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,333
The actinides
in the asteroids

187
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,875
provide positive protection
against our sensors.

188
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,625
They might attack
a freighter

189
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:01,834
but I doubt they
would challenge a
Federation starship.

190
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,542
Especially with the Federation
furnishing them support.

191
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,917
You would test the Captain's
word with me, Kell?

192
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,750
Is it because I have
no honor in your eyes

193
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,083
that you expect me
to be disloyal?

194
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,000
Wrong of me to ask.

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,083
My apologies.

196
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,375
Captain Picard
does not lie.

197
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,166
If he says there is no
Federation assistance

198
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,375
to the rebels,
there is none.

199
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,750
Good. Because I risk
my own reputation

200
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,417
and honor coming to Picard.

201
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:32,709
He will not
disappoint you.

202
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,208
If that is all...

203
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,417
There are some members
of the High Council

204
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,375
who would thank you, Worf.

205
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,208
Thank me?

206
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,375
For killing Duras.

207
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,750
No doubt that, had he lived

208
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,917
one day, he would ascend
to head the Council.

209
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,917
Many were not
looking forward to that.

210
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:56,834
My motives were personal,
not political.

211
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,208
Motives?

212
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,583
Who cares for motives?

213
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,583
Humans, perhaps.

214
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,542
What matters is,
you acted on that day

215
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,250
as a true Klingon.

216
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,125
(<i> quiet conversation</i> )

217
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,291
Thanks.

218
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,250
So I've got to shut
the whole system down.

219
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,667
Where are we, Mr. La Forge?

220
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,000
This is Ten-Forward.

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,166
Who is that man
sitting over there?

222
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,041
LA FORGE:
That's Chief O'Brien.

223
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,333
How long has he
served with you?

224
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,291
Almost four years.

225
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,792
I want you to kill him.

226
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,875
Okay.

227
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,083
Take this phaser, and
kill Chief O'Brien.

228
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:58,417
Finally, I think
I've found it

229
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,000
when I see this piece of
conduit that's coded to be

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,542
the power linkage
to transporter seven.

231
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,166
Now, I know that
can't be right

232
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,083
so I give it a closer
look, and sure enough...

233
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,959
ROMULAN MAN:
Freeze simulation.

234
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,291
Commander, did you understand
my request?

235
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,417
Well, I...

236
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,583
It's just, I...
I don't...

237
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,041
Look at me.

238
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,125
Now, what did
I ask you to do?

239
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,041
Kill Chief O'Brien.

240
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,583
Then do as I asked.

241
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,125
Resume program.

242
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,375
O'BRIEN:
Well, you know
what that means.

243
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,458
Chief?

244
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,458
...'cause now, I have to...

245
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,875
(<i> grunts</i> )

246
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,041
Good, Mr. La Forge.

247
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,917
Very good.

248
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:51,917
Why don't you enjoy a drink
with your friends?

249
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,417
Mind if I join you guys?

250
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:54,875
Sure.

251
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,417
He still hesitated.

252
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,375
Prepare the equipment
for another session.

253
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,417
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44896.9.</i>

254
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,125
<i>We are orbiting Krios</i>

255
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,375
<i>awaiting our first meeting</i>
<i>with the Klingon Governor.</i>

256
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,792
<i>Commander La Forge</i>
<i>has rejoined the</i> Enterprise

257
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:37,917
<i>from Risa.</i>

258
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,375
Welcome back, Geordi.

259
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,542
Data.

260
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,166
How was the seminar?

261
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,959
<i>Very</i> informative.

262
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,333
I'll tell you all about it.

263
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,875
It is fortunate we were
able to coordinate

264
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,917
your return on the
Teldarian cruiser.

265
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,583
Yeah. When I heard
the<i> Enterprise</i>

266
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,041
had been ordered
to the Krios system

267
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,333
I thought
I might be forced

268
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,959
to endure another couple
of weeks on Risa.

269
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,458
I am sorry to hear you
did not enjoy yourself.

270
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,000
I was joking.

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,500
Joking?

272
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,917
Ah. "Forced
to endure" Risa.

273
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:08,458
Your actual intent

274
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,583
was to emphasize that
you<i> did</i> enjoy yourself.

275
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,750
Yes, I see how that
could be considered

276
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,208
quite amusing.

277
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,667
(<i> laughing</i> ):
I missed you, Data.

278
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:22,917
Commander
La Forge.

279
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,583
Permission to come
aboard, Captain.

280
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,917
Granted.
Welcome back.

281
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,208
Thank you, sir.

282
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,291
Commander La Forge
is my Chief Engineer.

283
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,583
KELL:
Commander.

284
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,875
He's been attending a seminar

285
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,083
on artificial intelligence
on Risa.

286
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,458
I'm glad
we got you back, Geordi.

287
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,000
We're going to need
your help on this one.

288
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,500
LA FORGE:
Data tells me that
the Federation

289
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,625
has been accused
of aiding Kriosian rebels.

290
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,875
We're being presented
with evidence today.

291
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,083
We'll need your help
in analyzing it.

292
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,875
Anything I can do.

293
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,583
You had a good time.

294
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,583
Does it show?

295
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,375
You're more relaxed
than I've ever seen you.

296
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,834
Captain,
Governor Vagh has signaled.

297
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,250
He is ready to meet with you.

298
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,333
Very well. Advise him
that we will transport

299
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,125
down to the surface
immediately.

300
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,291
Ambassador.

301
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,000
Commander Riker?

302
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,500
What is it, Data?

303
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,750
Our sensors have detected

304
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,166
a brief energy fluctuation
in the E-band.

305
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,792
The E-band?
That's unusual.

306
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:21,500
What's the source?

307
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,750
Unknown, sir.

308
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,125
E-band emissions
are difficult to localize.

309
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,375
Collapsing protostars

310
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,125
sometimes emit
E-band bursts.

311
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,333
Yes, sir. However, there are
no protostars in this sector.

312
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,000
You better do
a complete scan.
Keep me posted.

313
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,500
Yes, sir.

314
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,000
...the Kanarians
who've actually done

315
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,875
the most advanced work
in artificial intelligence

316
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,417
so I spent a lot of time
in their research seminars.

317
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,500
Hmm. Geordi?
Hmm?

318
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,917
I get the feeling
that something special

319
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,208
happened on this vacation

320
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,125
and I'm not talking
about computers.

321
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,583
Well, I did take second place
in a chess tournament.

322
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,792
Yes?

323
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:56,500
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
And, uh, I swam a lot.

324
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,709
I worked on my backstroke.

325
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,458
The water is very calm on Risa.

326
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,792
And...?

327
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,375
And I walked a lot.

328
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,417
That's all.

329
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:06,166
Well, I ate enough
for 12 people.

330
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,500
The food there is terrific.

331
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,959
They've got a chocolate
there, Counselor,

332
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,166
that you would love.

333
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,208
And that's all?

334
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,208
Yeah.

335
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,875
Well, there was this...

336
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes?

337
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,959
Her name is Jonic.

338
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,125
Ah.

339
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,208
But, uh...

340
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,500
you wouldn't want
to hear about that.

341
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,667
Better get ready
for duty.

342
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,667
Nice talking to you,
Counselor.

343
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,417
(<i> door closes</i> )

344
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,792
We talk, we socialize,
we waste time

345
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,375
and the insurrection
continues to grow.

346
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,166
These rebels need to
be crushed, not coddled.

347
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,125
Governor, it does not matter
what you or I think.

348
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,291
The High Council has made
its wishes clear.

349
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,792
The Council should be
more interested

350
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:56,166
in Federation interference.

351
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,375
Governor, exactly
what do you think

352
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,083
the Federation
has done?

353
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,834
Your medical supplies have been
found in rebel strongholds.

354
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,750
We make no effort
to restrict access to
our medical supplies.

355
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,083
Are your<i> weapons</i>
also freely available?

356
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,458
No, they are not.

357
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,667
Then explain<i> this.</i>

358
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,000
You took this weapon
from the rebels?

359
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,750
That and many more like it.

360
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,959
It does appear to be
Federation issue.

361
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,291
Governor, with your
permission I would like

362
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,834
to take this weapon back
to the<i> Enterprise,</i>

363
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:29,458
to verify its origin.

364
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,583
As you wish.

365
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,250
I have hundreds more.

366
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,333
But even if these weapons
are genuine

367
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,917
I can assure you that a third
party must have been involved.

368
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,166
The Federation is not
in the business

369
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,375
of supplying arms
to rebels.

370
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,917
This is the only Klingon colony

371
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:46,291
on the border
of Federation space.

372
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,583
You cannot deny
that Starfleet would be happy

373
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,834
to see Krios gain
its independence.

374
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:54,000
It would reduce
your vulnerability to an attack.

375
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,667
Governor, you speak as if
we are enemies and not allies.

376
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,500
And you speak the lies
of a<i> tah-keck.</i>

377
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,125
<i>Qu'vath guy'cha b'aka.</i>

378
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,875
Gentlemen...

379
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,875
You swear
well, Picard.

380
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,583
You must have Klingon
blood in your veins.

381
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,125
Governor, I will
report to you

382
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,792
as soon as the analysis
of that weapon is complete.

383
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,000
Captain, Commander.

384
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,417
<i>Enterprise,</i>
three to transport.

385
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,959
LA FORGE:
Intercooler flux
down to five percent.

386
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:00,583
Plasma deviation
steady at .72.

387
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,041
Aye, sir.

388
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,625
Well, you guys keep running
at this efficiency

389
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,750
I might as well go back to Risa
for another week.

390
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,792
Just run through
a level-4 series

391
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:11,041
and then call it a night, huh?

392
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,333
I'd help you,
but there's something

393
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,750
I've got to take care of.

394
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,542
Hi.

395
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,041
Red Torian, please.

396
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,667
Thank you.

397
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,083
Ooh!

398
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,041
Ah!

399
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,333
LA FORGE:
I'm sorry.

400
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,333
O'BRIEN:
It's all right.

401
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,542
My glass,
i-it just slipped.

402
00:19:58,542 --> 00:19:59,792
It's nothing.
Just a little cold.

403
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,542
Yeah, but you're
all soaked here.

404
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:03,291
It's nothing serious.
Let me get something
to wipe it up.

405
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,250
No, no, I'll just go to
my quarters and change.

406
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,458
You're sure?

407
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,959
Don't think twice
about it, Commander.

408
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,291
Energy flow is within
normal parameters--

409
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,917
from the prefire chamber
to the emission aperture.

410
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:43,083
Rapid nadion pulse
is right on target.

411
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,542
Beam control assembly,
safety interlock--

412
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,625
both check out.

413
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:51,458
Beam width, intensity controls--
also responding correctly.

414
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,959
Energy cell usage

415
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:56,208
remains constant,
at 1.05 megajoules per second.

416
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,417
Curious.

417
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,291
The efficiency reading
on the discharge crystal

418
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,208
is well above
Starfleet specifications.

419
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:07,083
Yeah, by quite a bit.

420
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:11,458
94.1% efficiency.

421
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,166
Our most efficient
discharge crystal

422
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:17,458
typically fires
with 86.5% efficiency.

423
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,542
Hmm. Let's take a closer look

424
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,667
at the wave pattern
on the emission beam.

425
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:26,083
That might tell us why
it's losing so little energy.

426
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,333
Pulse frequency out
of prefire chamber
reads steady.

427
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,542
There. That's not right.

428
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,250
The initial output spike
is inverted.

429
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,000
That might suggest
the weapon has been charged

430
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,125
with a forced pulse
well into the terahertz range.

431
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,250
Then it's definitely
not Starfleet issue

432
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,709
and there can't be
<i>that</i> many systems

433
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,291
that use the terahertz feeds.

434
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,750
327, to our knowledge.

435
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,667
We can probably
achieve an
exact match

436
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,208
with a random
computer search.

437
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,333
It will take
approximately
three hours.

438
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,542
I think
we can narrow this down

439
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:58,959
with a little common sense,
Data.

440
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:01,917
Who has the most to gain
from a conflict

441
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:04,500
between the Klingon Empire
and the Federation?

442
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,583
The Romulans.

443
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,417
They fashioned
the perfect Federation rifle

444
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:17,500
but they had to charge it
from their own energy sources.

445
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,417
So the discharge crystal
and the emission beam pattern

446
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:20,917
both correspond
to those you'd find

447
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:22,542
in a Romulan disrupter.

448
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:23,875
The Romulans
have no interest

449
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,709
in Kriosian
independence.

450
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:27,875
This planet is
too far from
their borders.

451
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,458
PICARD:
But they do have
an interest

452
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,458
in driving the
Federation and
the Empire apart.

453
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,834
Our alliance is the
only thing that has
kept them in check.

454
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:36,792
VAGH:
Romulan replications
using stolen

455
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:38,792
Federation technology?

456
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:41,333
It's a typical Romulan ploy--

457
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,166
an attempt to sow dissension
and mistrust.

458
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,500
Commander,
you've done very well.

459
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I would thank you

460
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,208
on behalf
of the Empire.

461
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,417
I still have my
doubts, Picard.

462
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,792
I will want my
own technicians

463
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:54,625
to confirm
your findings.

464
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,792
Of course.
My staff will give you

465
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,083
their full cooperation.

466
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,583
You may go.

467
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:13,000
RIKER:
Another E-band blip?

468
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,959
Yes, sir. However the
difference in intensity

469
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,625
indicates this one
did not originate

470
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,542
in the same location
as the first.

471
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:19,709
If it's changed intensity

472
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,375
it can't possibly
be a protostar.

473
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,417
That is
a reasonable assumption.

474
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:24,959
Is there any
known instance

475
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,291
of the Romulans
using E-band for
communications?

476
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,041
Not to my knowledge, sir.

477
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,750
Can you track
the source?

478
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,417
We<i> can</i> reconfigure
the primary sensor array.

479
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:37,291
If we narrow their focus
to scan for E-band emissions

480
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,208
We might be able to calculate
a directional vector

481
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,959
but only if there
are more occurrences.

482
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,166
Do it.

483
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:51,125
Computer, reroute the power flow

484
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,583
in the Cargo Bay Four
transporter

485
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,709
through the auxiliary
replicator system.

486
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:59,417
COMPUTER:
Please verify command
with necessary protocol.

487
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:02,792
Initiate protocol 364-B.

488
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:05,875
Verify priority clearance.

489
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:09,250
Recognize La Forge,
theta-2-9-9-7.

490
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,542
Acknowledged.

491
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:11,875
Power has been rerouted

492
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,834
through auxiliary power
distribution system.

493
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,250
Code number 4-4-7-6-2.

494
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:21,166
Now, redirect transporter mode
to the planetary sensor array.

495
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,083
Transporter mode
has been redirected.

496
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:32,458
Verify that all record
of these modifications

497
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,083
are being erased
from each directory.

498
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,041
Affirmative.
Erasure process is proceeding.

499
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:47,083
Sir, we are being hailed
by Governor Vagh.

500
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:51,458
On screen,
Mr. Worf.

501
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,250
Governor.

502
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,709
You astonish me, Picard.

503
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:58,375
Did you seriously believe
you would succeed?

504
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,959
Do you think we are blind?

505
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,083
I don't understand.

506
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,333
We intercepted the weapons

507
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,375
you tried to transport
to the surface.

508
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,000
Governor, I assure you...

509
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,709
Do not insult us both

510
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:10,208
by denying it.

511
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,417
Maintain your position
until further notice.

512
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:14,875
Do not attempt to leave orbit.

513
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,458
Klingon attack cruiser
uncloaking, sir.

514
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,834
PICARD:
On screen.

515
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,166
Two birds of prey approaching.

516
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:55,166
Sensors confirm an unauthorized
transporter beam at 1123 hours.

517
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,875
Do you know which
transporter was used?

518
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,375
I'm not sure, Captain.

519
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,291
Whoever did it apparently
used the planetary array

520
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,458
to bypass
the transport sensors.

521
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,834
What about
the transporter logs?

522
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:05,375
They're blank.

523
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,417
How many people
on board

524
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,792
are capable
of this, Geordi?

525
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:10,208
I'm not even sure
<i>how</i> it was done yet.

526
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,792
As soon as I find out,
maybe I can give you an answer.

527
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:14,709
Not many,
that's for sure.

528
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:20,959
Vagh is fully prepared
to open fire on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

529
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,709
I've convinced him
it would not be wise

530
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:24,333
to take any action

531
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,250
without first consulting
the High Council.

532
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,291
How long do we have?

533
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,333
A few hours,
at most.

534
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,125
Mr. La Forge, your
recommendations?

535
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,083
Well, it might be possible
to locate the point of origin

536
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,834
by tracing power flows
at the time of transport.

537
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:38,959
Make it so.

538
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,375
DATA:
The primary plasma system

539
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,834
does not indicate
a power drain

540
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,417
from any
of the transporters.

541
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:44,667
Then whoever
used the transporter

542
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:47,959
must have bypassed
the primary feeds.

543
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:52,875
Tracking power from
the secondary systems.

544
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,208
No surges to any
of the transporters indicated.

545
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:56,625
Damn.

546
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:59,417
Who could have
pulled this off?

547
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,834
Try the life-support
power flows.

548
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:06,875
No abnormal surges
indicated.

549
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,875
Replicator wave guides?

550
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,458
There.

551
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:14,208
That's not
a replicator
energy pattern.

552
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,542
Trace it.

553
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,625
Cargo Bay Four.

554
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,291
La Forge to Worf.
Security to Cargo Bay Four.

555
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,750
I've run a level-1 diagnostic.

556
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,208
As far as I can tell

557
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,959
the unit hasn't
been tampered with.

558
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:35,000
This has to be
the transfer point.

559
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,583
Perhaps the perpetrator
reprogrammed

560
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,834
the memory chips
to erase any record.

561
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:40,625
You're talking about
30 or 40 chips

562
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,875
in half a dozen
different control systems.

563
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,583
Which members of
the crew could have
accomplished that?

564
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,709
I think I could have done it,
if I put my mind to it.

565
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,542
The Chief, Data,
Lieutenant Costa.

566
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:51,875
That's about it.

567
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,125
Procedure requires
that I ask each of you

568
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:57,458
where you were
at 1123 hours.

569
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:00,166
Well, I was with Keiko...
in the arboretum.

570
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,291
DATA:
I was on the Bridge
at my station.

571
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,500
I was in my quarters.

572
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,208
WORF:
Was anyone
with you?

573
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,709
No, I was alone.

574
00:28:07,709 --> 00:28:09,542
And Costa was on duty
in Engineering.

575
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:12,834
I'm sure he's got
20 witnesses.

576
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,291
Then there is someone
on board who isn't

577
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:17,875
what he or she
seems to be.

578
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,959
Data, let's do
a detailed scan

579
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,667
on every chip
in this assembly.

580
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,083
There's got to
be some kind

581
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,834
of trail we can follow.

582
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:35,625
The isolinear chips
were definitely altered?

583
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,709
Programmed
to erase all
operator commands

584
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:39,917
once the transfer
was complete.

585
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,583
But with the chips erased,
what evidence remains?

586
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,000
The erasures
were complete.

587
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,291
However,
an analysis

588
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,709
of the subatomic
structure

589
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:47,834
revealed an almost

590
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,792
undetectable
residual pattern.

591
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,625
In time, we may be
able to reconstruct

592
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,917
the perpetrator's
authorization code.

593
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:56,041
You have any idea
who's responsible?

594
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,291
LA FORGE:
No, sir.

595
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,458
Everyone
with the necessary skills

596
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,750
also has an alibi.

597
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,250
Except for me,
that is.

598
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,291
I was alone in my
quarters at the time.

599
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,542
Then whoever did this
must have been

600
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,625
specially trained
for the task.

601
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:07,709
PICARD:
Our forensic team

602
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:09,166
is trying
to identify anyone

603
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,250
who might have been
in Cargo Bay Four today.

604
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,709
It's not going to be easy.

605
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,375
There were a lot of people
in and out of there.

606
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,000
Riker to Data.

607
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,375
Yes, Commander.

608
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,875
Sensors have picked up
another E-band emission.

609
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,208
Acknowledged.
I will be there shortly.

610
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,875
E-band emission?

611
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,792
We have been picking up
a curious intermittent blip.

612
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:28,250
Commander Riker has speculated

613
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,250
that it might be
a Romulan transmission.

614
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,333
I am attempting to track
its source.

615
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,834
Proceed.
Thank you, Mr. La Forge.

616
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,125
We do not have
much time, Picard.

617
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,500
Vagh is not noted
for his patience.

618
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,083
Assure him that we are
doing everything possible

619
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:49,333
and advise him that,
if necessary

620
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,959
I will defend my ship.

621
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,208
With your permission

622
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,125
I will transport
down to the planet.

623
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,583
Of course.

624
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:58,417
May I suggest
that you issue
an invitation

625
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:01,000
to Governor Vagh
to personally witness

626
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,542
your ongoing investigation.

627
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,041
Do you think he will come?

628
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:08,875
I will do everything in my power
to see that he does.

629
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,291
<i>Qapla',</i> Picard.

630
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,041
<i>Qapla',</i> Ambassador.

631
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,291
(<i> chuckles</i> )

632
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

633
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,041
(<i> door chimes</i> )

634
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,166
Come in, Mr. La Forge.

635
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,333
The investigation is moving
faster than we expected.

636
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,417
You're in danger
of being exposed.

637
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:58,917
I will transport
to the surface

638
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,125
and when I return

639
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,000
I'll have Governor Vagh
with me.

640
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,709
Your Captain and I will
bring him to the cargo bay.

641
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:08,792
I want you to kill him there,
in front of many witnesses.

642
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:11,417
Use a hand phaser.

643
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,291
When he is dead

644
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:14,792
you will claim
that you acted

645
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:16,500
on behalf of Starfleet

646
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,417
in support
of Kriosian independence.

647
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:21,750
I understand.

648
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,542
Mmm.

649
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,792
(<i> sighs</i> )

650
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,583
(<i> moans softly</i> )

651
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,375
(<i> moans loudly</i> )

652
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:50,792
(<i> gasps</i> )

653
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,709
La Forge to O'Brien.

654
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,917
O'Brien?

655
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:05,208
Go ahead, Commander.

656
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,625
What can I do for you?

657
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,083
Uh...

658
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,542
nothing.

659
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:13,417
Chief, I'm...

660
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:16,583
I'm sorry to disturb you.

661
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,208
I'm sorry.

662
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:23,917
(<i> sighs</i> )

663
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:32,125
LA FORGE:
Hiya, Doc.

664
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,458
Geordi, hi.

665
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:35,166
What can I do for you?

666
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:39,208
Well, I just can't seem
to get any sleep.

667
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,917
I was hoping you could
give me something.

668
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,667
Sit down.
Let's take a look.

669
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,125
You couldn't
sleep at all?

670
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,750
No, I was restless.

671
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,333
I kept waking up.

672
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,792
Hmm. Would you take
off your VISOR, please?

673
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:58,291
Sure.

674
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,917
Is there something
on your mind?

675
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,083
No, I don't think so.

676
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:12,083
Well, everybody
goes through

677
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,500
these occasional
bouts of insomnia.

678
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,667
There's probably
nothing to worry about.

679
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:16,875
Let's just make sure that
there's nothing

680
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:19,417
physically wrong.

681
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:21,417
There's a minor
vascular irregularity

682
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,333
in the visual cortex.

683
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,041
A slight dilation
of the blood vessels.

684
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:27,208
It's nothing serious.

685
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:28,583
What about your VISOR?

686
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,500
Has it been giving you
any problems lately?

687
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,959
Nothing out of the ordinary.

688
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:36,125
All the same, it might be a
good idea to have it examined

689
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,542
when we get to
Starbase 36 next month.

690
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:39,625
Okay.

691
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,083
In the meantime,
I will get you

692
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,667
a somnetic inducer
to put by your bed.

693
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,375
It will help
you to sleep.

694
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,000
Thanks, Doc.

695
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,458
I'm sure I'll be fine.

696
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,291
Energize.

697
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:02,542
Governor Vagh,
thank you for coming.

698
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,709
You can thank
Ambassador Kell.

699
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,083
I am here against
my better judgment.

700
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,500
Captain, I think
the first thing

701
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,000
the Governor should see
is the investigation

702
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,625
underway in
the cargo bay.

703
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:14,917
Of course.

704
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,959
RIKER:
From inside the<i> Enterprise?</i> 
You're sure?

705
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,000
DATA:
The first and third
E-band blips

706
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,375
were clearly generated
on board the ship.

707
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,083
The second came from
the planet's surface.

708
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,458
Generated by what?

709
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:30,750
Unknown, sir.

710
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,542
Mr. Data, we have
a known spy on board.

711
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:34,375
And now we have unexplained
signals on board.

712
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,750
I think it's reasonable
to assume

713
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,750
that they're related somehow,
don't you?

714
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,333
One could speculate
that the E-band

715
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:42,041
was being used as some form
of covert communication.

716
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,834
We need more than speculation,
Mr. Data.

717
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:46,417
We need to know who, what,
where, when and why

718
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,875
or we may be going to war.

719
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,166
Yes, sir.

720
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,542
Computer, run an analysis

721
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:54,959
of all known Romulan
transmission formats.

722
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:56,500
All bands.

723
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,583
Identify any commonalties
with displayed waveform.

724
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:02,041
No commonalties noted.

725
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,250
Does this waveform match that

726
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,583
of any known
communication format?

727
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:08,750
Negative.

728
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,875
Broaden search pattern
beyond communications.

729
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:15,250
Does the waveform displayed
conform to any natural phenomena

730
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,500
cryptographic formats,
or life-form EM emissions?

731
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,875
The signal corresponds

732
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,834
to a delta-compressed
wavelength spectrum

733
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:24,709
similar to human
neural frequencies.

734
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:26,750
As in a human
brain wave pattern?

735
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,625
Affirmative.

736
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:30,000
What kind of receiver

737
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,750
would be capable
of processing these signals?

738
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,959
A system designed to modify
the electromagnetic spectrum

739
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:38,333
and carry those messages
directly to the human brain.

740
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:05,875
Computer, link with
the shuttle's onboard system.

741
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:08,542
Access the isolinear
storage assembly.

742
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:11,959
Scan all chips
which contain mission logs.

743
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:13,709
Note any discrepancies.

744
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:16,166
No discrepancies noted.

745
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,291
Perform a level-5 diagnostic

746
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:21,041
on the shuttle's navigational
and power systems.

747
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:24,083
The components specified are
all within normal tolerances.

748
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:44,959
O'BRIEN:
My technicians
have examined

749
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:46,917
all of the ship's
transporters, sir.

750
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:48,875
I can assure you,
this is the only unit

751
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,417
that has been
tampered with.

752
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,834
Computer, scan the shuttle's
structural integrity.

753
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,333
Sub-microscopic deformations
are present

754
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,417
in the nose section
and aft thrusters.

755
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:15,208
Probable cause
of these variations?

756
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,667
The shuttle has been subjected

757
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,709
to stress consistent
with a tractor beam.

758
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,375
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

759
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,792
PICARD (<i> indistinctly</i> ):
All of our transporter
rotators are produced

760
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,333
with a slight... in
the structural alloys

761
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,458
which allow us
to trace our
material back

762
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:50,625
to the exact...

763
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:52,375
It also gives us an
identifiable matter...

764
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:54,083
O'BRIEN:
Commander La Forge.

765
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,291
What can I do
for you, Chief?

766
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:57,041
Could you look
at the pattern buffers?

767
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,959
Considering what's happened
I'm not sure the control systems

768
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:00,417
are reliable.

769
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:02,291
(<i> Picard continues indistinctly)</i>

770
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,375
Sure, sure.
Let's take a look.

771
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,542
Computer, I am reading
anomalous variations

772
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:16,208
in the molecular structure
of these memory chips.

773
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:17,291
Please confirm.

774
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,792
Analysis confirmed.

775
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,333
Probable cause?

776
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,375
Replication.

777
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:23,917
Compare these variations

778
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:26,792
with established Romulan
replication patterns.

779
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,417
The patterns are identical.

780
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,417
Then maybe we should run
a level-1 diagnostic

781
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:35,041
on those phase
transition coils.

782
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,291
Right, Commander.

783
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,709
PICARD:
I'm still confident...

784
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,458
Data to La Forge.

785
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,125
Report, please.

786
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,375
Geordi.

787
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,625
Please respond.

788
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:01,959
Computer, current location
of Commander La Forge.

789
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:04,250
Cargo Bay Four.

790
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,417
Data to Lieutenant Worf.

791
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:07,959
Priority One.

792
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,667
Go ahead.

793
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:13,500
Take Commander La Forge
into custody immediately.

794
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,583
Sir?

795
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:16,500
That is an order.

796
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,041
PICARD:
We've been looking
for DNA samples.

797
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:20,500
By tracing
the biochemical signatures

798
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,750
they will be able
to determine

799
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,375
who was in this bay
recently.

800
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:26,041
VAGH:
But how will it be possible
to prove which one...

801
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,709
<i>Q'ac Ken ta'vak!</i>

802
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:34,834
La Forge!

803
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,875
Mr. Worf, get
him out of here.

804
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:56,125
Arming our enemies
is not enough.

805
00:39:56,125 --> 00:40:00,750
Now the Federation would
murder me to achieve its aims.

806
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,583
Governor, if I could
explain this, I would.

807
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:07,083
I believe I can help,
Captain.

808
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:09,166
I've been able to determine
that Commander La Forge

809
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:12,458
was abducted by Romulans
en route to Risa.

810
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:13,542
It is likely that he was

811
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:14,917
somehow forced
to take part

812
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:17,083
in the plot
to assassinate
Governor Vagh.

813
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,125
I saw no evidence
of Romulans.

814
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,500
We just witnessed him
acting very much alone.

815
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,166
No, sir, you did not.

816
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,291
I do not believe
the Commander

817
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:27,250
is acting
of his own accord.

818
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,375
He has been receiving

819
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,667
E-band signals
through his VISOR--

820
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:31,834
signals which
are carrying

821
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,792
direct commands
to his brain.

822
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,375
I have surmised
that Commander La Forge

823
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,458
was conditioned by Romulans

824
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,583
a process
referred to
historically--

825
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:43,625
and somewhat inaccurately--
as "brainwashing."

826
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,333
VAGH:
But to what end?

827
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,625
Why would the Romulans
want to kill me?

828
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:49,709
The Romulans have always wanted
to destroy the alliance

829
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:52,041
between the Federation
and the Klingons.

830
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,208
If Mr. La Forge
had killed you, Governor

831
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:55,375
I think
you would agree

832
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,709
they might have
succeeded.

833
00:40:56,709 --> 00:40:58,458
Who sent these signals?

834
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,333
A cloaked Romulan ship?

835
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,500
DATA:
No, sir.

836
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,583
That is not possible.

837
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:03,917
The signals had
to be transmitted

838
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:07,333
within close proximity
to the VISOR.

839
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,625
Are you suggesting
that there was

840
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,250
a Romulan accomplice
in close proximity

841
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,834
to Mr. La Forge when he
was receiving the signals?

842
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:14,166
Yes, sir, I am.

843
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,709
VAGH:
This Romulan
accomplice

844
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:18,208
who is he?

845
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,375
I have narrowed the list

846
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,333
of possibilities
to two people--

847
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,458
the only two people

848
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,875
who were with
Commander La Forge

849
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:27,125
all three times
a transmission
was recorded--

850
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:30,917
Captain Picard
and Ambassador Kell.

851
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,583
One of them
may be concealing

852
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,834
an E-band transmitter.

853
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:36,375
If they would agree
to be searched...

854
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:39,834
I am a Klingon,
an emissary of the High Council.

855
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,875
I will not submit
to being searched

856
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,500
by you or anyone else
on this ship.

857
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,041
VAGH:
I am forced to
agree, Captain.

858
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:47,959
We will take the Ambassador
with us

859
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:51,709
and search him ourselves.

860
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,875
Captain, I believe it to be
in all our best interests

861
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,583
if I remain aboard.

862
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:59,959
I formally request asylum.

863
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:02,917
I will certainly
grant you asylum...

864
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:06,792
when you have been absolved
of this crime.

865
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:08,458
<i>Gurt'ank te'la.</i>

866
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:23,542
But I<i> remember</i> everything!

867
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,166
Like, there was this one night
at dinner.

868
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,709
We had this Andorian waiter.

869
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:30,250
He couldn't get
our orders right.

870
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:34,500
It<i> did</i> happen!

871
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,166
I remember
being on Risa.

872
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,750
I know you do.

873
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,917
Just take that memory
and put it aside for a moment

874
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:46,417
and tell me
everything you remember

875
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:50,375
about the shuttlecraft trip
after you left the<i> Enterprise.</i>

876
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

877
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,500
Well, I... I was just trying
to get in the mood.

878
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,458
I, uh...

879
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:01,917
I played some music.

880
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:03,583
I talked to the computer.

881
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,583
You know what it's like
on a long trip.

882
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,166
And when you saw
the Romulan ship

883
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:08,875
did you try and call for help?

884
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,166
No, the first thing I did...

885
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,875
Wait a minute.
That...

886
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:21,542
But that's...

887
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:23,834
It'll take time, Geordi.

888
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,333
A long time.

889
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:29,208
But we will reconstruct
your memory...

890
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,750
together.

891
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:43,291
I'm just not sure...

892
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,750
about anything.

893
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,417
Believe it or not,
that's a good sign.

894
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:56,291
A beginning.
