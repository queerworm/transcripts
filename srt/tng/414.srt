<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44502.7.</i>

00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:15,792
<i>Early completion of our</i>
<i>mission at Harrakis V</i>

3
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:18,000
<i>has allowed me to grant extra</i>

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
<i>for many of the crew.</i>

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,083
<i>This has come</i>
<i>as something of a relief</i>

6
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,125
<i>since our recent</i>

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,291

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,750
<i>that are a normal part of life</i>
<i>aboard the</i> Enterprise.

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,291
<i>I expect our journey past the</i>

10
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,834

11
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:38,834

12
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,000
Dixon Hill around?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,625
He's occupied at
the present moment.

14
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,417
Tell him Gloria's here.

15
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,625
Can't do that.

16
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,083
He doesn't want
to be disturbed.

17
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,875

Gloria from...

26
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,333
Look,<i> hon,</i>

27
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,667
just tell him
Gloria's here.

28
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:20,375
Look, when the boss doesn't
want to be disturbed

29
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,709
the boss doesn't want
to be disturbed.

30
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,834
Don't take it personal-like.

31
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,792
I have
an appointment

32
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:29,250
with Mr. Hill at...

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,834
2:00.

34
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:32,792
It's 2:10.

35
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,667
So? I had a little trouble
getting into the dress.

36
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,542
It took me a little while
to figure out just exactly

37
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:43,291
what I was supposed
to do with these.

38

Sorry, Dix.

41
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,125
There's a "lady"
here to see you.

42
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,542
Says her name is...

43
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:54,500
Gloria.

44
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,667
Gloria.

45
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:56,834
From Cleveland.

46
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:59,250
From Cleveland.

47
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,250
Okay.

48
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,917
He never heard of you.

49
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,375
He's never heard of me?

50
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,750
That's right.

51
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,917
Oh, wait,
I don't think you understand.

52
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:10,125
You see... this was

53
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,375
all set up in advance,
you see.

54
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,083
I'm supposed to be
Gloria from Cleveland

55
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,250
and I was supposed to be on
Holodeck Number Four at 2:00...

56
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,208
And you don't have any idea

57
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,125
what I'm talking about,
do you?

58
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,041
Not to worry.

59
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,000
Hey, you can't go in there.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,166

Get inside.
Close the door.

61
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,166
Who's the doll?

62
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,709
She's, uh...

63
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,458
(<i> with gangster accent</i> ):
The doll's my cousin.

64
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,458
Yeah.

65
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,542

I'm sorry about
this... Gloria.

68
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:51,792
I didn't actually mean
you to get involved.

69
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:54,166
She knows nothin'
about this, Johnny.

70
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,667
What does...
what does that mean?

71
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,917
Oh, oh, I see.

72
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,667
JOHNNY:
Yeah, right.

73
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,291
What do I look like-- a jamoke?

74
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,041
You ain't nobody's cousin
and you ain't here on a visit.

75
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,917
Now, what do you know
about my money?

76
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,458
Your money?

77
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,792
The money he stole!

78
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,375
You stole his money?

79
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,500
Don't listen
to him, Gloria.

80
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,875
He's lyin'.

81
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,291
Oh... oh!

82
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,709
Oh, Johnny... Johnny!

83
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:20,709
Talk to me, Johnny.

84
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:21,959
I'm a great listener.

85
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,166
I'm finished with talking,
sweetheart.

86
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,667
Now I'm going
to get some action

87
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:26,542
or else!

88
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,125

89
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,834
And this is what
you do for fun.

90
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,834
It's a mystery.

91
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,834
Who is this man?

92
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,375
Who killed him?

93
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,458
Where is the money
he was talking about?

94
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,583
It's... it's a mystery.

95
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:03,083
Now we have to go
search for clues.

96
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,041
Ah, and that's fun?

97
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,959
That's<i> fun.</i>

00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,667
Damn it, I didn't get
the license plate.

106
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:18,834
Captain Picard?

107
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:22,208
Sorry, there's
no Captain Picard here.

108
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,917
Maybe you should try
down at the docks.

109
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:25,250
There's ships coming in
and out of there every day...

110
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,291
It's all right, Madeline.

111
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,875
I'll take it in here.

112
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,750
Yes, what is it?

113
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,000
Captain,
Lieutenant Commander Data here.

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,083
Please excuse
the unusual interruption

115
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,458
but under the circumstances

116
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,583
I thought that patching
communications

117
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,542
through the holodeck program
would be less intrusive.

118
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,583
I appreciate your concern,
Commander Data.

119
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,875
What can I do for you?

120
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,333
Long-range sensors
detect a T-Tauri type star

121
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,125
within a pocket
of the Ngame cloud.

122
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,125
Well, there's nothing
unusual about that.

123
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,291
No, sir.

124
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,834
However, the star's
single planet

125
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,667
falls within the
M-Class range.

126
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,458
It is capable
of supporting life.

127
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,792
Now, that<i> is</i> unusual.

128
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:01,917
Highly, sir.

129
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:04,125
Well, thank you, Mr. Data.

130
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,917
Procedure requires
that we investigate.

131
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:08,083
Recall the Bridge crew
and set in a course.

132
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,417
Aye, sir.

133
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,959
I'm, uh... I'm sorry, Gloria

134
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,917
but there
is a 24th century mystery

135
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,458
I have to investigate.

136
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,875
You are very welcome
to carry on if you like.

137
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,917
No, I've had enough
fun for today.

138
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,417
Entering the T-Tauri
system now, Captain.

139
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,625
Sensors indicate
an energy fluctuation

140
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,041

Wormhole.

145
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,041
Very likely.

146
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,291
Small and extremely
unstable wormholes

147
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,667
have been mapped
near 39 T-Tauri systems

148
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,625
in the last 100
years alone, sir.

149
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,750
Captain, I suggest

150
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,959
we move
to a safer location.

151
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,291
It could reappear
at any moment.

152
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,750
Agreed, Number One.

153
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,125

The stun effect
from the wormhole

167
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,333
was relatively severe.

168
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,417
Apparently so.

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,542
Sir, I should realign
the ship's clock

183
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:52,041
with Starbase 410's
sub-space signal

184
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,542
to adjust
for the time distortion.

185
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:54,500
Proceed.

186
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,709
Yes, Captain.

187
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,000
Captain, this is Crusher
in Sick Bay.

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,834
Go ahead, Doctor.

189
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,208
I'm getting scattered reports

190
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,208
of minor injuries.
What's happened?

191
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,750
The<i> Enterprise</i> just jumped
through a wormhole.

192
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,125
Apparently, we were
all unconscious

193
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,542
for about 30 seconds.

194
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,542
Is everybody all right there?

195
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:13,792
There's little or no damage
on the Bridge, Doctor.

196
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,500
Acknowledged. Crusher out.

197
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,000
Ship's status?

198
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,417
Reports coming in now.

199
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,417
Nothing serious so far.

200
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:22,875
La Forge here, Captain.

201
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,542
I've checked impulse engines
and warp drive, sir.

202
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:27,667
They appear to be unaffected.

203
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,041
Shields and weapon systems
are fully functional.

204
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,500
Counselor,
are you all right?

205
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,917
I think so.

206
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:38,166
I'm feeling a bit unfocused.

207
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,667
It'll pass.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,875
Well, not too bad,
all things considered.

209
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,542
We're lucky we didn't end up
halfway across the galaxy

210
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:49,792
into the middle
of next week.

211
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:53,208
That was never actually
a possibility.

212
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,000
The wormhole's small size
and relatively short period

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,291
would make this
a local phenomenon.

214
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,166
There's still
the anomalous
M-Class planet

215
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,417
we were going
to investigate.

216
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:03,625
Do we go back?

217
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,291
The unpredictability
of the wormhole

218
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,917
would make an investigation
a hazardous one.

219
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,667
A probe launched
from our current position

220
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,000
would be more advisable.

221
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,667
Make it so.

222
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,667
Nothing's broken, Chief

223
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,417
but those ligaments
around the elbow

224
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,208
have been twisted
pretty severely.

225
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,875
What on earth were you
doing when you fell?

226
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,125
Hanging a plant for Keiko.

227
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,917
It's part of a running project
to give me a green thumb.

228
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,542
How's it working?

229
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:38,667
Everything I touch seems
to turn brown and wither away.

230
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:41,250
Alyssa,
would you get me...?

231
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,709
Oh, never mind.
I'll get it.

232
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,709
<i>You...</i> don't go away.

233
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:00,000
This isn't possible.

234
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,083
Alyssa?

235
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,792
Yes, Doctor?

236
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,959
Did you see anyone
near the lab today?

237
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,750
No, I didn't.

238
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,083
You didn't by chance

239
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,417
adjust the environments
on the incubation containers?

240
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:28,834
I would never touch
one of your experiments

241
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,291
unless you asked me to, Doctor.

242
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,375
Of course not.

243
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,041
I'm sorry, Alyssa.
Thank you.

244
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:39,542
Probe approaching the
T-Tauri system, Captain.

245
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,709
Readings, Data?

246
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,250
Coming in now, sir.

247
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,083
The probe is
within visual range
of the planet.

248
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,375
On screen.

249
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,834
DATA:
Sensors indicate
a hydrogen-helium composition

250
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:54,834
with a frozen helium core.

251
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,166
RIKER:
Wait a minute.

252
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,542
Didn't your readings
indicate a Class-M planet

253
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:02,083
before we passed
through the wormhole, Data?

254
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,709
It is possible
that the sensors
were affected

255
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:07,458
by interference from the
wormhole, Commander.

256
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,542
It is clearly not
a Class-M planet.

257
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:13,750
Mr. Data, run a full diagnostic
to make sure that the wormhole

258
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,583
didn't permanently damage
the sensors.

259
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,875
Aye, sir.

260
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,417
Ensign, take us
back on our course...

261
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:19,917
Captain...

262
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,375
Problem, Number One?

263
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,959
It seems awfully strange
that a malfunctioning sensor

264
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,875
would give such a specific
misreading of a planet.

265
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,667
I would have thought
that a time/space disturbance

266
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,959
would have caused
a lot more confusion than that.

267
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,041
It is conceivable that the
sensors picked up the afterimage

268
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,834
of an actual planet on the other
side of the wormhole.

269
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:39,542
We could survey the nearby
stars for such a planet.

270
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,792
It would require approximately
six days, sir.

271
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:43,792
No, no. We don't
have time for that.

272
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,583
We've encountered
a minor mystery.

273
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,875
One that has been solved
to my satisfaction.

274
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,458
Number One, unless there's
a major objection

275
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,709
then Ensign McKnight should

276
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,709
put us back on course
for Evadne IV.

277
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:54,709
No objection.

278
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:55,667
Ensign.

279
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,041
Aye, sir.

280
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,333
(<i> door chimes</i> )

281
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,750
PICARD:
Come.

282
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,083
I have something
of a minor mystery on my hands.

283
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,750
"A minor mystery--"
that seems to be

284
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,834
a recurring phrase these days.

285
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:20,250
Oh...

286
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,458
Diomedian scarlet moss.

287
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,709
I didn't know you
were an ethnobotanist.

288
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:28,750
It's a hobby.

289
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,166
You've got a
good crop here.

290
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,250
As I recall, it's
not easy to cultivate.

291
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,583
That's just it.

292
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,291
I started these spores

293
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:40,291
right before we were all knocked
unconscious by the wormhole.

294
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,750
You said we were unconscious
for 30 seconds?

295
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,125
Correct.

296
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,250
Then why do these
show a full day's growth?

297
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,417
Perhaps you got some sort
of fast-growth strain here.

298
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,917
Each of these incubators
was set with spores

299
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:59,583
from completely different
sources in the Diomedian system.

300
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,792
I have a dozen more in the lab.

301
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:05,166
Perhaps something extraordinary
happened to<i> one</i> of them

302
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,125
but not
to<i> all</i> of them.

303
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,333
Doctor, we were not unconscious
for a whole day.

304
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,792
Everything on board indicates

305
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,333
that we were out
for 30 seconds--

306
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,166
the ship's chronometer,
the computer

307
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,792
everything, Doctor,

308
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,875
including Commander Data.

309
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,875
Jean-Luc, I'm telling you

310
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,375
this is over 24 hours of growth.

311
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,208
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

312
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,291
<i>Commander Data</i>
<i>continues to maintain</i>

313
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,834
<i>that we were unconscious</i>
<i>for only 30 seconds</i>

314
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:45,750
<i>despite Dr. Crusher's evidence</i>
<i>to the contrary.</i>

315
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,166
Captain, I have
a hypothesis.

316
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,583
The 22nd century physicist
Pell Underhill

317
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,542
conjectured that a major
disruption in time continuity

318
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:01,500
could be compensated for by
trillions of counterreactions.

319
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,000
That effect may have allowed
Dr. Crusher's moss

320
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,417
to arrive at the other side
of the wormhole

321
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,542
with the unanticipated growth.

322
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,709
Underhill was talking
about energy.

323
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:12,834
DATA:
True.

324
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,667
Nevertheless, it is possible

325
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:17,542
that the phenomenon
could occur in matter

326
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,583
at higher levels
of organization

327
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,500
given the proper conditions.

328
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,125
Thank you, Data.

329
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,917
Intriguing hypothesis.

330
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,417
Well, perhaps

331
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:31,125
we've got a tempest in
a test tube, after all.

332
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,083
Captain...

333
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,542
Data, I promised Mr. Nelson

334
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:38,291
that you would assist him
with the sensor diagnostic.

335
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,166
You'll find him hard
at work on deck 36.

336
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,208
As you wish, Captain.

337
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:53,417
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

338
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,208
Do you believe him?

339
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,834
I want a frank answer,
Commander.

340
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,208
Not for a second.

341
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,834
I'm amazed
he even proposed it.

342
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,208
What are you
suggesting, Captain?

343
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,083
I'm not sure, Mr. Worf.

344
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:15,166
I have never known Data
to tell a lie,

345
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,500
and yet...

346
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,417
If we never went
through that wormhole

347
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:22,208
then what happened to us
during that day?

348
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,375
If we<i> were</i> out
for a whole day

349
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,083
then why didn't
our beards grow?

350
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,375
Whatever it was,
it seems it was something

351
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,000
Data didn't want
to tell us about.

352
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,792
It could be that whatever
caused this situation

353
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,875
also affected Data

354
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:39,667
and it could be
that he's telling the truth

355
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:43,041
and that this is all
just a minor mystery.

356
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,250
We could always check
the computer's chronometer.

357
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,000
See if there's any evidence
of tampering.

358
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,500
A transporter
trace analysis

359
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,166
might give us
another indication

360
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,375
of how much time
has actually passed.

361
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,417
Doctor, Commander,
make it so.

362
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,542
Meanwhile, we will

363
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:57,166
maintain
our present course.

364
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,875
If there is something wrong
with Data

365
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,917
we don't want him
to be aware of our suspicions.

366
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,792
Gentlemen, how
goes the battle?

367
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,875
Long-range and infrared
sensors apparently suffered

368
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,000
no ill effects
as a result of the wormhole.

369
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,834
We are presently
checking neutrino

370
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:21,583
and heavy particle
detectors.

371
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,542
Great.

372
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,417
I'll take over now, Data.

373
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:26,875
Captain wants you
back on the Bridge.

374
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,250
See you later
in Ten-Forward?

375
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:37,667
Nelson, I need your help
with the computer.

376
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,458
Hello, Chief.

377
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,458
How's the elbow?

378
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,625
Oh, much better, thanks.

379
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,417
This isn't
a house call, is it?

380
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:46,500
No, it's not.

381
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,875
Tell me, do you remember

382
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,834
the last person to use
the transporter

383
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,333
before we went
through the wormhole?

384
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,667
Well, let me check.

385
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:57,667
Ensign Locklin.

386
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,792
She's one of my technicians.

387
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,458
Tell her to report
to Sick Bay immediately.

388
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:06,083
CRUSHER:
Electrolyte
concentration?

389
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,542
12.5 deviation from previous.

390
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:11,041
Interesting.

391
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,834
Check the cellular
membranes.

392
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,125
I'm willing to bet

393
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,959
that the inner turgid
pressure is off

394
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:18,166
by almost
the same amount.

395
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,709
11.3 deviation from the norm.

396
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:22,834
Terrific, that's
what I wanted to hear.

397
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:26,917
Thank you, Ensign Locklin.
That'll be all for now.

398
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,750
Crusher to Captain Picard.

399
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,166
What is it, Doctor?

400
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,166
I need to see you immediately.

401
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,667
I'm on my way to Engineering.

402
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:34,959
Join me.

403
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:41,667
Physiologically, each of us
is on a daily cycle.

404
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,875
Our cells have developed rhythms
based on a 24-hour period.

405
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,917
Internal clock.

406
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,417
Exactly.

407
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:51,166
And I can measure that effect
at the molecular level.

408
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,709
I took a trace
from the last person

409
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,250
to use the transporter
before the incident

410
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,125
and compared her cell function
levels at that time

411
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,417
to what they are right now.

412
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,959
If we were unconscious
for only 30 seconds

413
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,792
those cycles should be
nearly synchronous.

414
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:08,041
And were they?

415
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,667
No.

416
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:13,041
We were out for longer
than 30 seconds, Captain.

417
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,250
A lot longer.

418
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,667
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

419
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,750
The good news
is that we were right

420
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,125
about the computer's
chronometer.

421
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,834
There's a security program
to prevent tampering

422
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,875
but it looks now
like it was disabled

423
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,834
and a new program
put in its place.

424
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:37,500
Someone has reset the clock.

425
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,417
If that's the good news,
what's the bad news?

426
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:43,208
That Data and I are
the only ones

427
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,000
aboard this ship
capable of doing it.

428
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,542
It is a mystery, Captain.

429
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:56,000
That is an understatement, Data.

430
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:01,083
Is it possible
that someone or<i> something</i>

431
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,000
could have affected you
without your knowing?

432
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,333
I am unable to answer
that question, sir.

433
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,625
Data, would you consent
to being examined

434
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,667
by Commander La Forge?

435
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,083
As you wish, Captain.

436
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,917
Will you escort
Commander Data
to Engineering?

437
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,875
I know the way, sir.

438
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:33,500
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

439
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,250
<i>It has become clear that</i>
<i>everyone aboard the</i> Enterprise

440
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,709
<i>has lost an entire day.</i>

441
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:40,375
<i>As the mystery</i>
<i>of what actually occurred</i>

442
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,667

<i>continues to deepen</i>

443
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:47,125
<i>so do my doubts</i>
<i>about Commander Data.</i>

444
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,625
We'll start with
the higher functions

445
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,625
before we get down
to basics, okay?

446
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,750
All right.
Now this won't hurt a bit.

447
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,959
Have you forgotten, Geordi,
that my sensory inputs

448
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:01,458
are not programmed
to experience pain?

449
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,417
It's a figure of speech, Data--
bedside manner.

450
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:06,500
You know, I'm just trying
to make you feel comfortable.

451
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,291
I am perfectly
comfortable.

452
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,458
Pattern recognition,
syntactic algorithms

453
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,875
heuristic functions
all normal.

454
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,625
I have noticed, however

455
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,291
that you appear a bit
uncomfortable yourself.

456
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,208
Well, it just seems like
you're not being

457
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,041
completely honest
with us, Data.

458
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,667
I'm your friend.

459
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,375
If there's something wrong,
I want you to tell me.

460
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,458
Maybe I can help.

461
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,750
I cannot tell you anything

462
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,834
beyond what I have
already stated.

463
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,458
Okay.

464
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,208
Excuse us, Counselor?

465
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,417
Mm-hmm.

466
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:53,583
Captain, I've
finished examining Data.

467
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,083
And?

468
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,000
Nothing's wrong with the
technology that I can see.

469
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,417
He's in perfect condition.

470
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,417
I was almost hoping
that you'd find a problem.

471
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,834
Well, he still could
be malfunctioning

472
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:06,291
beyond my ability
to detect it.

473
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,625
This entire mystery started

474
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,667
when our sensors
detected that planet.

475
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,083
First, it was Class-M,
now it isn't.

476
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,583
Our sensors
were malfunctioning

477
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,458
but our probe clearly
established

478
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,917
the planet could
not support life.

479
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:19,667
Data launched that probe.

480
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,792
If he rigged it,
could you prove it?

481
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:23,083
I could try.

482
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,041
What happened to us
during that missing day?

483
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,583
Surely, there must be
some clues.

484
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,083
Each of us should try and
think of what we were doing

485
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,417
just before we blacked out.

486
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:35,500
Reenact it if...

487
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,875

all right?

490
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,959
Yes.

491
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,208
Yes, I'm fine.

492
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,250
What happened?

493
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,917
I suddenly became dizzy.

494
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:53,959
I think I'd better go
to my quarters.

495
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:56,083
Perhaps the Sick Bay
would be a better idea.

496
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,834
No, no, really,
I'm all right.

497
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,166
Will you see the Counselor
to her quarters?

498
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,458
Aye, sir.

00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:15,542
Thank you for coming
with me, Mr. Worf.

00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:17,291

you are well?

some rest.

I came in here.

510
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,583
I looked into the mirror.

511
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,125

Is she all right?

515
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,917
I feel fine...

516
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:07,125

539
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,166
A warrior does not complain
about physical discomfort.

540
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:09,083
But the Captain
ordered us

541
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,834
to report anything
out of the ordinary.

542
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,875
Are you in pain?

543
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:18,667
How did this happen?

544
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:27,291
Do you recognize this planet,
Data?

545
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,208
Yes, sir.

546
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:33,166
It is the planet our probes
detected in the T-Tauri system.

547
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:36,083
LA FORGE:
No, it's not.

548
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:39,625
Actually, it's Tethys III.

549
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,250
I retrieved this image
from the ship's library.

550
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,542
Its geophysical figures
have been slightly altered

551
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,458
but it's definitely Tethys III.

552
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,291
Strange that
an obscure planet

553
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:51,166
hundreds of light-years
from here

554
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,041
should be picked up
by the probe.

555
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,375
Data

556
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:00,667
did you take this image
from the ship's library

557
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:03,959
and program the probe
to send it back to us?

558
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:06,291
I cannot verify
that hypothesis.

559
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,792
But you don't deny it.

560
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,083
No, sir.

561
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:14,667
Mr. La Forge, will you
send another probe

562
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,083
to the T-Tauri system.

563
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,875
Yes, sir.

564
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,875
I'm sorry, Data.

565
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:31,917
Counselor Troi has just had
a very disturbing hallucination.

566
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,417
Is she all
right, sir?

567
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:38,125
For the moment.

568
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:42,041
Can you tell me if Deanna's
incident is related

569
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:45,166
in any way to this
missing time period?

570
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,625
No, sir, I cannot.

571
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,750
Data, you are the key
to this entire mystery

572
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,917
and you have done nothing

573
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:53,041
but block my every attempt
to solve it.

574
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,250
Why are you fighting me?

575
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,417
It is not by choice.

576
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,875
What do you mean
by that?

577
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,458
I cannot say.

578
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:03,917
Would you rather endanger
Deanna, a friend and colleague

579
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,625
than tell me what is going on?

580
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,083
Which would you
place first--

581
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,291
the welfare of a
single individual

582
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,667
or that of the entire crew?

583
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,542
Are you saying
that by not cooperating

584
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:19,667
you are actually protecting us?

585
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,917
I am not saying that at all.

586
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:25,667
I merely state a possible
alternative explanation.

587
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:31,375
Then, Mr. Data, I'm going
to ask you again...

588
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,458
and I order you to
directly answer me.

589
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,208
What really
happened to us?

590
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,792
I cannot answer that.

591
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,959
What would you
have me do, Data?

592
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:55,083
How would you handle this
if our positions were reversed?

593
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,166
I am apparently guilty

594
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:02,166
of falsifying
the<i> Enterprise's</i> records

595
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:05,250
of interfering
with an investigation

596
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,291
of disobeying a direct order
from my commanding officer.

597
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,625
Your duty seems clear, sir.

598
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:18,125
Do you know what a court-martial
would mean?

599
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:21,500
Your career in Starfleet
would be finished.

600
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
I realize that, sir.

601
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,166
Do you also realize

602
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,917
that you would most likely
be stripped down to your wires

603
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:30,208
to find out what the hell
has gone wrong?

604
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,125
Yes, sir.

605
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,458
I do.

606
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:44,959
This wrist has been broken--
broken and reset and treated

607
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:48,375
with one of our own subcutaneous
bone fusion units.

608
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,000
During the missing day?

609
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,542
That's the only possibility.

610
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:55,583
Are you suggesting
he was conscious?

611
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,291
I'm suggesting
that maybe we all were.

612
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:00,500
I certainly didn't repair
a broken wrist

613
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,542
while I was unconscious.

614
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:04,875
And our memories
of that day?

615
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:05,917
CRUSHER:
Blocked.

616
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:08,166
Possibly erased.

617
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,166
By whom?

618
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,166
There are very few individuals
on board

619
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:14,583
who could have broken my wrist.

620
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:17,709
Commander Data<i> is</i>
one of those individuals.

621
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:19,333
I can't accept
that explanation.

622
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:22,291
Well, he does possess
the speed and the strength.

623
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,417
Granted.

624
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:25,792
But I'm beginning to suspect

625
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:28,792
that Commander Data
is refusing to cooperate

626
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:30,458
because he believes
that he is acting

627
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:33,083
in the best interests
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

628
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,583
La Forge to Captain Picard.

629
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:35,834
Go ahead, Geordi.

630
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,333
Our probe is approaching
the planet, sir.

631
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,500
Acknowledged.

632
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,458
Maybe now we'll
get some answers.

633
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,875
What do you have,
Mr. La Forge?

634
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,750
Visuals available
now, Captain.

635
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,583
M-Class.
Nickel-iron core.

636
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,250
Nitrogen-oxygen
atmosphere.

637
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:57,166
The same planet
our sensors picked up

638
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:59,792
before the so-called wormhole.

639
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:01,083
Affirmative.

640
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,542
LA FORGE:
No indication
of any space/time

641
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,667
distortion whatsoever.

642
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,834
The probe should
at least be detecting
some residual effect,

643
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,583
even if the wormhole
is inactive.

644
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,125
That's because
there is no wormhole.

645
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,750
There never was.

646
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,417
RIKER:
Sir?

647
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:19,041
It was a ruse designed
to throw us off the track.

648
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:20,291
Look at the clues--

649
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:22,959
Dr. Crusher's
incubation experiment

650
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:25,375
the computer clock,
the transporter trace--

651
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:29,000
all indicate the existence
of a missing day.

652
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,583
Lieutenant Worf's
broken wrist

653
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:33,041
would seem to suggest that...

654
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,250
we were awake

655
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,291
and aware for that day.

656
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:40,333
Possibly in a struggle
for our lives.

657
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,625
The fact that we're still alive
suggests we might have won.

658
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,208
Not necessarily, Doctor.

659
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:48,500
Data's behavior would seem
to suggest that we did not.

660
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,333
Why else would he be willing
to sacrifice his career

661
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,750
rather than tell the truth?

662
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,083
If we didn't win,
<i>and</i> we didn't lose...

663
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,333
Then the only
alternative

664
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,959
would be a stalemate.

665
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,625
Maybe a compromise was reached.

666
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,959
A compromise that forced Data
into this silence.

667
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,375
Then maybe by
uncovering all this

668
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,041
we'd run the risk of
upsetting the stalemate.

669
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,625
Maybe we should leave
well-enough alone.

670
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,542
Possibly, Number One,
and I will be prepared

671
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:14,250
to live with the mystery

672
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,250
but Data's role in this
must be ascertained

673
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,709
or he'll never be trusted
with Starfleet duty again.

674
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:23,000
Ensign, take us back
to the scene of the crime--

675
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,500
the T-Tauri system.
Warp two.

676
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:32,333
Within sensor range, Captain.

677
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,792
Drop to impulse, Ensign.

678
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,333
Mr. Worf, maximum shields.
Ready all weapons.

679
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,166
Shields up.

680
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,709
Photon torpedoes armed,
phasers standing by.

681
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:42,000
(<i> console beeping</i> )

682
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,959
Captain,

683
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:44,250
an energy field has appeared

684
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,417
between our position
and the planet.

685
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:48,041
On screen.

686
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,625
Hold position.

687
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:54,625
Let's see
what it does.

688
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,959
(<i> sensors beeping</i> )

689
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,834
The field has emitted
an energy pulse

690
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,250
approaching the<i> Enterprise.</i>

691
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,875
RIKER:
Too slow to be
a photon torpedo.

692
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:06,041
It might be a probe.

693
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:09,208
Let's see what happens
when it hits the shields.

694
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,083
Shields undamaged.

695
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,583
The energy pulse has dispersed.

696
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,291
Counselor Troi...

697
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:42,834
what is it?

698
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:45,375
(<i> deep, resonating voice):</i>
The plan has failed.

699
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:49,709
<i>You</i> have returned.

700
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:53,375
Your ship is again
in our space.

701
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,709
I was unable
to prevent it.

702
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:58,959
Nevertheless,
you are here.

703
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:01,166
The<i> Enterprise</i> is not
a threat to you.

704
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,208
Give me more time.

705
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,834
Our destruction
would only...

706
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:07,834
Data, Captain wanted me
to bring you to the Bridge.

707
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:09,709
Counselor?

708
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:12,041
One moment, if you would.

709
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,083
Do nothing.

710
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:21,709
It may yet be possible
to salvage the situation.

711
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,417
Reporting as ordered, Captain.

712
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:37,959
Well, Data, as you can see,
we're back where it all started.

713
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,834
DATA:
We must leave immediately, sir.

714
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:44,542
Why?

715
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:45,583
Any further delay

716
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,333
would put us all
at grave risk.

717
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:50,000
Why?

718
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,917
What is the source
of that risk?

719
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:54,291
The energy field?

720
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:57,166
I cannot say.

721
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:58,917
Data, you sound
as if you're stuck

722
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:01,792
in a... feedback loop.

723
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,375
You certainly can say.

724
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,583
You have free will.

725
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:05,709
You have a choice.

726
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,959
My silence is not
by choice, sir.

727
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,375
Not by choice?

728
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:14,583
Are you somehow controlled
by that force?

729
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,750
Did Geordi miss something
when he examined you?

730
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,041
Geordi's examination
was exemplary.

731
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:22,083
Then why are you compelled
to disobey my orders?

732
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,333
How...?

733
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:30,750
During the missing day...

734
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,417
were you contacted by Starfleet?

735
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:38,000
Did they order you
to conceal the truth from us?

736
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,667
I cannot answer that.

737
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,041
We must leave, sir.

738
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:43,500
This ship isn't
going anywhere,

739
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,709
not until I get an answer.

740
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,375
Now, who gave you that order?

741
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:51,291
(<i> door opens</i> )

742
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:03,041
You did, sir.

743
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:14,583
<i>I</i> ordered you to lie?

744
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:17,375
Captain, the energy field
is approaching.

745
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:23,834
Maintain shields
at full intensity.

746
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:25,875
DATA:
No, we must vary
shield shape

747
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,667
and strength
as rapidly as possible.

748
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,750
Maximum shields will only
speed the ship's takeover.

749
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,750
Contact imminent.

750
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,417
Do as Data says.
At once.

751
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:34,750
Aye, sir.

752
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:43,208
The field is shifting amplitude,
trying to match our shields.

753
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:46,333
The energy field will eventually
penetrate our shields, sir.

754
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:49,875
There is no way to counter
the Paxans' technology.

755
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,917
We can delay
their takeover

756
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,417
but we cannot prevent it.

757
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,542
The Paxans?

758
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:55,875
Who are they?

759
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:03,458
You have invaded
our system.

760
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:04,667
DATA:
No.

761
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:05,875
Worf!

762
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,917
You will only harm
Counselor Troi's body.

763
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,834
PICARD:
We are not invaders.

764
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,291
We are explorers.

765
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,625
Your knowledge of us
is unacceptable.

766
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:20,041
They are xenophobes, sir--
isolationists.

767
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:23,208
The Paxans terraformed
a protoplanet in this system

768
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:26,041
in order to better conceal
their whereabouts.

769
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,709
The apparent wormhole
we experienced

770
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:30,792
is actually a trap
to keep out invaders.

771
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,166
The energy field

772
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:34,834
stuns everyone on board
the invading vessel

773
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:37,625
and then places them in a state
of biochemical stasis.

774
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:40,291
That explains why
our beards didn't grow.

775
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:42,750
The Paxans then take the ship
out of their territory.

776
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,959
So the crew wakes up
and thinks

777
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,250
they've been
through a wormhole.

778
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,875
They count their blessings
and keep going?

779
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:48,500
Precisely.

780
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,542
What went wrong this time?

781
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,166
My positronic brain

782
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,875
is a technology
unknown to the Paxans.

783
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:58,250
Our stun-field had
no effect on him.

784
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,709
He remained conscious

785
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:01,834
while we tried to
take over the ship.

786
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:04,667
When I realized the crew
was incapacitated

787
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,583
I initiated
emergency procedures.

788
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:13,208
DATA:
Computer, engage Emergency Plan

789
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,083
Zed Zed Alpha.

790
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:18,208
COMPUTER:

791
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,041
Energy field strength
increasing.

792
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,125
Warning.

793
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:25,208
Shield penetration 17%.

794
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:28,000
Computer,
begin random fluctuation

795
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
of shield frequency
and modulation.

796
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,125
Executed.

797
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,542
DATA:
<i>With the</i> Enterprise<i> temporarily</i>
<i>protected, I revived the crew.</i>

798
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:40,709

00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:42,250
into the air flow system.

800
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,041
Five parts per million.

801
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,583
Acknowledged.

802
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,959
Initiating compound release now.

803
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:50,083
(<i> air hissing</i> )

804
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,291
Status, Data?

805
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,709
The energy field is
attempting to match

806
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:03,041
the shield
frequency, sir.

807
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,542
Options, Mr. Worf?

808
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:07,250
I do not recommend weapons
at this range, Captain.

809
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,583
Can we go to warp?

810
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,417
Negative, sir.
The field is
also acting

811
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,917
as a tractor beam.

812
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:16,125
COMPUTER:
Warning.
Shields have been penetrated.

813
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,917
All systems
are frozen, Captain.

814
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:20,792
DATA:
<i>The Paxans can manipulate</i>
<i>energy structures</i>

815
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,291
<i>on many levels.</i>

816
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,583
<i>They took control</i>

817
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:26,083
<i>to communicate with us.</i>

818
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:30,583
Captain!

819
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,542
(<i> gasps</i> )

820
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:34,959
(<i> groans</i> )

821
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:38,458
No, stop, everyone.

822
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,458
Who are you?

823
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:44,500
(<i> deep, resonate voice</i> ):
You are aware of our existence.

824
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Our attempt to place you in
biochemical stasis has failed.

825
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,709
We have no choice
but to destroy this ship.

826
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,625
If you destroy this ship

827
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:57,417
then others will come
in search of us.

828
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,333
You may not be able
to stop them all.

829
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,667
Knowledge of your civilization

830
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:02,583
will be spread
across half the galaxy.

831
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,250
No.

832
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:07,834
Allow us safe passage

833
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:10,125
and I will protect
your right to privacy

834
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,917
to the best of my ability.

835
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,709
We will never tell anyone
of your existence.

836
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:18,166
There are over 1,000 life-forms
on this vessel.

837
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:20,834
How could you assure
their silence?

838
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,542
This biochemical stasis--

839
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:29,000
does it suppress
synaptic function?

840
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,458
It does.

841
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:33,583
Then you have the capability
of affecting memory.

842
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,583
Can you erase
the short-term memory

843
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,208
of everyone on this ship?

844
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,375
Remove all knowledge
of this event?

845
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:42,291
Allow us to proceed as if
it had never happened?

846
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:44,542
It would take time.

847
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:46,834
One of your days.

848
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:51,667
He is immune to our influence.

849
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,667
Data, I'm going to give
you a most unusual order.

850
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:01,041
I'm not sure that you will
be able to integrate it

851
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,750
into your program.

852
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,208
As a Starfleet officer

853
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,500
I am required to follow
all of your orders, Captain.

854
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,875
Good...

855
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:12,542
because our survival
depends on it.

856
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:16,208
I am ordering you
never to reveal

857
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,291
what has happened
here today--

858
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,625
not to Starfleet,
not to myself even.

859
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:25,083
You will conceal your knowledge
of the Paxans

860
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:27,709
for as long
as you exist.

861
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:31,166
Do you fully
understand, Data?

862
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:32,500
Completely, sir.

863
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,291
Satisfactory?

864
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,083
Agreed.

865
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,667
Good.

866
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:42,417
Now, our task
is to eliminate

867
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:44,083
from the ship's records

868
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,125
any information
that might lead

869
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:46,834
to knowledge of this incident.

870
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,792
Let's get to work.

871
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:53,583
We proceeded to erase
all evidence

872
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,166
of our encounter
with the Paxans.

873
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,834
I reset
the computer's chronometer.

874
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:57,959
And again, the crew

875
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,583
was stunned into
unconsciousness

876
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,458
their short-term
memories erased.

877
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,166
When they were
revived a day later

878
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,667
the computer adjustments
made it appear that only

879
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:07,500
30 seconds
had passed.

880
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,041
And here we are.

881
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,542
Here we are<i> again.</i>

882
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:12,500
PAXAN:
Your plan
has failed.

883
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,750
This ship must be destroyed.

884
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,250
No, wait!

885
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,625
The plan failed
because clues were left behind

886
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:23,208
that suggested a mystery,
and to many humans

887
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:25,667
a mystery
is irresistible.

888
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,917
It must be solved.

889
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:30,834
The Doctor's incubation
experiment, Worf's wrist

890
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:33,000
Troi's hallucinations--

891
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,583
little pieces
of evidence

892
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:36,083
that suggested
even more clues.

893
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,250
The clock

894
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,792
the transporter trace

895
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:42,250
Data's odd behavior.

896
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,041
If we eliminate the clues

897
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:47,041
and begin again...

898
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,083
Again?

899
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,208
Yes.

900
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:51,417
Consider the first time

901
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,959
a run-through, a rehearsal,

902
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:55,792
to shake out the flaws.

903
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:57,959
The second time
will succeed

904
00:41:57,959 --> 00:42:00,375
<i>if</i> we leave no clues.

905
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:03,875
You are
a most unusual species...

906
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:06,500
worthy of a second chance.

907
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,792
Proceed.

908
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:14,750
Deanna?

909
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:23,000
PICARD:
Welcome back, Counselor.

910
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,750
Geordi, Data, reconfigure
the computer and the records.

911
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,583
Number One, I want you
to oversee the rest of the ship

912
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:31,333
and this time...
let's get it right.

913
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:45,667
What happened, Data?

914
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:48,417
The effect from
the wormhole was
rather intense, sir.

915
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:49,834
So it would seem.

916
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,500
Everyone but myself was
rendered unconscious.

917
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,959
My positronic system
is immune to the effect.

918
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,625
How long were we out?

919
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:57,875
30 seconds, sir.

920
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,542
RIKER:
Current position?

921
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,583
.54 parsecs
from our previous position.

922
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,125
Bearing 285 mark 147.

923
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,083
It could be worse.
Yes, sir.

924
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:10,542
The wormhole appears to have
been a local phenomenon.

925
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:11,583
Crusher to Bridge.

926
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,208
What happened, Captain?

927
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:16,000
The<i> Enterprise</i> went
through a wormhole, Doctor.

928
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,333
It seems the entire crew

929
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,500
was unconscious for
approximately 30 seconds.

930
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,750
Is anyone on the Bridge hurt?

931
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,917
Apparently not.

932
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:25,458
I'll start checking
the other decks.

933
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:26,458
Crusher out.

934
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:27,959
Status reports?

935
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:30,333
Shields and weapon systems
unaffected.

936
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,083
No damage in Engineering.

937
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,083
Counselor?

938
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,208
There's a general feeling

939
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,583
of disorientation on board

940
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:38,417
but nothing serious,
as far as I can tell.

941
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:40,458
Very well.

942
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:42,041
There's still
that anomalous Class-M planet

943
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:44,166
we were going to investigate.

944
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,166
Ensign, replot a course
to take us back...

945
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:47,792
Sir, it is likely

946
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,125
the anomalous readings

947
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:51,250
were the result
of the wormhole's effect.

948
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,250
It was extremely unstable.

949
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,500
I would recommend
against returning.

950
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,458
It might put the<i> Enterprise</i>
at further risk.

951
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:00,166
We could launch a probe.

952
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:01,792
That would certainly
be sufficient, sir.

953
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:10,750
Make it so

954
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,500
and put out a hazard advisory
to Starfleet.

955
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,750
Ensign, set a course
for Evadne IV.

956
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,041
Aye, sir.

957
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:19,625
Engage.

958
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:41,625
