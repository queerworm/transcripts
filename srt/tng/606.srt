Welcome to the<i> Enterprise,</i>
Miss Rogers.

8
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,458
I'm delighted
to have you on board.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,000
Thank you, sir.

10
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,625
And congratulations.
I understand that
you were selected

11
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,041
for this internship
out of hundreds
of applicants.

12
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,166
Yes, sir, I still can't
believe they chose me.

13
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,667
There were lots
of other people
with better records.

00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:34,542
CRUSHER:
Her transcript

15
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,583
is very impressive.
She's done honors work
in neurobiology,

16
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,041
plasma dynamics,
and eco-regeneration.

17
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,041
I'd say that's
pretty well-rounded.

18
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,625
Well, that's a nice way
of saying that I

19
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,583
haven't decided what I'm
going to do with my life.

20
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,625
I've arranged to have
you work in all the
major departments

21
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,709
while you're here,
and I'm willing to bet

22
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,917
that by the time
it's over, you'll have
a pretty good idea

23
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,291

Commander, will you
escort Miss Rogers
to her quarters?

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,625
I need to discuss
the Tagrans' medical
needs with Dr. Crusher.

32
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:10,625
And Miss Rogers?

33
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:11,917
Yes?

34
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,333
You've won yourself
a rare opportunity.

35
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,417
Avail yourself of it.

36
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:20,041
I will, sir,
and thank you.

37
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:29,041
It'll take you a few
days before you know
where everything is.

If you need any help
you just use... use
one of these com panels.

memorized the specs

only the best.

49
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,333
Well, I could have
brought my zoo.

00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,709
Your zoo?

51
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,500
Well, it's just what
my parents call it.

52
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,250
Three dogs isn't
that many, is it?

53
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,375
It depends how
they get along.

54
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,250

Do you have
any other children?

101

number of years ago.

Wes was our only child.

103

Was he old enough
to know his father?

104
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,750
Jack died when he was five.

105
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,250

Oh, thank you very much
for your help.

119

We can use every
available hand we can get.

120
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,750
This is one of
the largest relief efforts

121
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,083
we've ever mounted.

122
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,542
Now, why are you bringing
everything down

123
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,875
in shuttlecraft?

124
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,959
Well, because we can't use
the transporters

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,125
for all the ionization
in the Tagran atmosphere.

126
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,250
From the baristatic
filters?

127
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,250
How did you know that?

128
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,875
I did a paper on
eco-regeneration.

129
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:07,166
Well, then you know
that a thousand
baristatic filters

130
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,625
puts out quite a bit
of ionization.

131
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:09,583
A thousand?

132
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,917
Yeah. They've managed

133
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,959
to pollute their
atmosphere pretty badly.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,250
It's amazing to think
that they go to such lengths

135
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,750
to clean the air,
instead of regulating

136
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:18,875
the emissions
that cause the problem.

137
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:20,250
Yeah, you're right.

138
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,917
Actually, the only thing
the filters<i> can</i> do

139
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,792
is keep things
from getting worse.

140
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:27,750
They shoot the air
full of...

00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,250

are you all right?

142
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,041
You okay?

143
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,166
I didn't even
see it coming.

144
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,834
And this is
the main control area.

145
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,500
We can access any
of the primary circuits

146
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,000
from all of these panels.

147
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,959
Over here is
a Jefferies tube...

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,250
Where most of the major
conduits are routed.

149
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,917
You've been doing
your homework.

150
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,917
It's hard to imagine
how much energy is
harnessed in there.

151
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,000
Imagination
is not necessary.

152
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,000
The scale
is readily quantifiable.

153
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,208
We are presently generating

154
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,959

to try and vent the plasma.

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,500
All right, everybody,
out of here now!

167
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:33,709
Let's go! Let's move it!

She's a little shaken up

174
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,000
but she's going
to be fine.

175
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,625
You said she
was adopted.

176
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,000
Could she be
an alien?

177
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,750
She's human.

178
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,667
There's nothing
more unusual about her.

179
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:18,250
Not that my instruments
can detect.

180
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,625
Commander, have you been able

181
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,375
to determine
the cause of the warp breach?

182
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,834
No, sir.
Everything was normal
and then suddenly

183
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,125
it's like the laws of physics
went right out the window.

184
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,792
Q:
And why shouldn't they?

185
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,208
They're so inconvenient.

186
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,333
Q.

187
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,000
<i>Mon Capitain.</i>

188
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,458
Are you responsible for this
incident in Engineering?

189
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,792
Of course.

190
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:40,792
I needed to find out

191
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:41,792
if what I suspected

192
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:42,875
about the girl were true.

193
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,291
That being?

194
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,875
That she's Q.

195
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,500
TROI:
Amanda's a Q?

196
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:48,834
How is that possible?

197
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,959
Her-Her parents--

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,875
her biological parents--
were human.

199
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,417
Well, not exactly.

200
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,375
They had assumed human form
in order to visit Earth,

201
00:09:56,417 --> 00:10:01,667
I suppose for... for amusement,
but in vulgar human fashion,

202
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,458
they proceeded to conceive
a child.

203
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,959
And then like
mawkish humans,

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,667
they became
attached to it.

205
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:11,166
What is it about these
squirming little infants

206
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,542
that you find so appealing?

207
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,166
I'm sure that's beyond
your comprehension, Q.

208
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,625
I desperately hope so.

209
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,625
TROI:
What happened
to Amanda's parents?

210
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,166
They died in an accident.

211
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,625
None of us knew
whether she had
inherited

212
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,333
the capacities of the Q,
but recently,

213
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,083
they've begun to emerge,
and as an expert

214
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,917
in humanity,
I was sent to investigate.

215
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,333
<i>You,</i> an expert
in humanity?

216
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,750
Not a very challenging field
of study, I grant you.

217
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,917
Are you saying that you
created a core breach

218
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,083
just to test this girl?

219
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,500
Uh-huh.

220
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,458
What would have happened
if she couldn't stop it?

221
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,834
Then I would have known
she wasn't a Q.

222
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,709
And now that you know,
what do you intend to do?

223
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,291
Instruct her.

224
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,083
If this child does not learn
how to control her power,

225
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,041
she may accidentally
destroy herself...

226
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,667
or all of you,
or perhaps your entire galaxy.

227
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,000
I find it hard to believe

228
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,583
that you're here
to do us a favor.

229
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,709
You're quite right,
I wouldn't,

230
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,083
but there are those
in the Continuum

231
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:12,166
who have an over-exaggerated
sense of responsibility.

232
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,542
They think that we need
to take precautions

233
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,500
to keep the little dear
from running amok.

234
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,583
And once you've taught her,
then you'll go away?

235
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,834
And leave her here?

236
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,375
Of course not.

237
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,709
She'll come back to the
Continuum where she belongs.

238
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,542
Wait a minute. You can't just
come in here and take her away

239
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,333
from everything
she's ever known.

240
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,792
I assure you, I can.

241
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,125
She has plans for herself.

242
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,083
She wants to have a career
and a family.

243
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,083
I'm rescuing her
from that miserable existence.

244
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,500
That "miserable existence"
is all she's known

245
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:41,834
for the last 18 years.

246
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,125
You have no right
to take her away from it.

247
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:48,333
<i>Mon Capitain,</i> I really think
that we need to speak privately.

248
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:54,166
Well, there,
that's better.

249
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,041
Crusher gets more shrill
with each passing year.

250
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,542
Q, what is it
you really want?

251
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,250
Well, since you know
so much about the Q,

252
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,625
I thought you'd be
the perfect person

253
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,166
to introduce me
to the child.

254
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,000
Let her know that
she can trust me.

255
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,333
I don't trust you, Q.

256
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,875
Why should I expect Amanda to?

257
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:12,291
Well, she'd better,
because I'm all she's got.

258
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,792
She needs me to help her prepare
for her future with the Q.

259
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,166
But what if she doesn't want
that future?

260
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,500
It must be<i> her</i> decision.

261
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:22,083
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

262
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,500
Do you think that
she will want to remain
an enfeebled mortal?

263
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:26,667
Well, if she really is Q,

264
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:28,875
she must understand
what that means.

265
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,750
Very well.

266
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,625
I will introduce you, but...

267
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,250
(<i> sighs</i> )

268
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,750
we cannot argue
like this in front of her.

269
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,083
We must at least
appear to be...

270
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,000
Pals?

271
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:45,125
Civil.

272
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,291
I knew I could count
on you, Jean-Luc.

273
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:56,959
Mr. Data, I want
you to access

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,625
any available records
on Amanda Rogers.

275
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,041
Yes, Captain.

276
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,834
I want to know about
her biological parents...

277
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,667
about their death.

278
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:07,959
I find it odd that any Q
could die in an accident.

279
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,083
It is not consistent with
what we know of them, sir.

280
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,959
I'm convinced that Q isn't
telling us everything.

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,375
See what you
can find out.

282
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,458
Aye, sir.

283
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,291
It started happening
about six months ago--

284
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,458
things that I would wish for
would just suddenly appear.

285
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,750
I thought I was going crazy.

286
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:29,208
In a funny way,
finding this out

287
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,500
is kind of a relief.

288
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,500
I can understand
that.

289
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:34,917
This person
I mentioned--

290
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,083
from the Q Continuum--
would like to meet you

291
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,959
if it's all
right with you.

292
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:44,750
I'm ready.

293
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,875
Good.

294
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:52,834
There's my girl.

295
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,834
Amanda, allow me
to introduce, uh... Q.

296
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,458
He's, um...

297
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,750
he's an acquaintance of ours.

298
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:03,041
We've, uh...
we've known him for years.

299
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,792
Very impressive the way you
contained that explosion.

300
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:06,834
What else have you done?

301
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,208
I-I don't understand.

302
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,458
Telekinesis? Teleportation?

303
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,625
Spontaneous

304
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:16,041
combustion
of someone you don't like?

305
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,542
That sort of thing.

306
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,125
Amanda, what Q is asking

307
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,875
is have you ever deliberately
used your abilities?

308
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:25,083
Not until I came here.

309
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,625
The first time it happened

310
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,959
was when the container
almost fell on Commander Riker.

311
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,458
And you handled
that very well.

312
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,291
That's why I gave you
a greater challenge--

313
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,166
the warp core breach.

314
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,583
She has potential, this one.

315
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,542
I see no reason

316
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,709
why she can't return
to the Continuum right now.

317
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,834
What?
Q...

318
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't want
to go anywhere.

319
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,458
Don't worry.

320
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,417
With time, you'll overcome
the disadvantages

321
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,667
you suffered
as a child.

322
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,208
No one will hold
it against you

323
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,583
for having been human.

324
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,667
Let's go.

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,709
Leave me alone!

326
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,333
I'm not going anywhere with you.

327
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,959
You agree that
she has a right to
choose her own future,

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,875
but the first chance you
get, you try to abduct her.

329
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:13,291
You're overreacting,
as usual, Picard.

330
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,917
I was merely
testing her powers.

331
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,041
She's quite a little spitfire,
now, isn't she?

332
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,667
What's going on, Q?

333
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,667
What's your real purpose here?

334
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,375
I think I've been
perfectly clear.

335
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,875
The Continuum has a vested
interest in this young woman.

336
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:27,875
If you wish to protect
that investment,

337
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:30,375
I suggest that you approach her
differently.

338
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,250
She was being impetuous.

339
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,291
She'll just have to start
behaving like a Q.

340
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,333
If I'm not mistaken,
she just did.

341
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:43,000
You understand, don't you?

342
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,834
It's just that I have
these things that I want to do.

343
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,458
I'm going to go
to the Academy.

344
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,125
I want a career

345
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,583
and I want to
join Starfleet.

346
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,500
You can still do
all those things.

347
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:59,875
Yeah, but it just seems
so complicated now.

348
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,834
I mean, these powers
that I have--

349
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,375
they're just going
to stand in the way.

350
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:06,542
I don't want to have
to deal with that.

351
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,709
Well, you're
going to have to.

352
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,208
Listen, I can only imagine
how you feel.

353
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,125
That certainly would be easier
if this had never happened

354
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,333
or if it would just go away...

355
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,291
but it's not going to go away,

356
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,375
and you need someone
to help you,

357
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:28,750
and the person
who can help you is... Q.

358
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,458
(<i> sighs</i> )

359
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,041
But he's so horrible.

360
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,625
He is the only one
who can help you

361
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,542
to understand who you are.

362
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:40,583
Amanda...

363
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,041
you are going
to have to make

364
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,208
some hard choices
about your future,

365
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,458
and you can't make them

366
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,458
if you're going
to ignore the truth.

367
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,583
Yeah. I know.

368
00:16:56,041 --> 00:17:01,041
But I don't want any of this
to disrupt my time here.

369
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:05,959
I want to do everything
that I'm expected to do

370
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,291
and I don't want you
to treat me any differently.

371
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,208
Please.

372
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,583
You've got a deal.

373
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,333
The first free hour you have,

374
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,917
I want to see you
in the medical lab.

375
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,083
I have an experiment
I need your help with.

376
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,250
Yes, ma'am.

377
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,667
SHADOW:
Your progress, Q?

378
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:36,959
As anticipated,
there are some problems.

379
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,542
I need time.

380
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,500
However, there is
the possibility

381
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:43,458
we won't have to terminate
the girl.

382
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,583
(<i> door chimes</i> )

383
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,834
Come in.

384
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,834
Hello, my dear.

385
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,041
I've been told
I behaved badly.

386
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,667
I apologize.

387
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:11,583
Apparently, you had every reason
to chastise me,

388
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,834
but then again,
what's done is done, right?

389
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,125
I'd like to ask you
some questions.

390
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,667
Anything.

391
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:22,458
What exactly are the Q?

392
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,709
It would be so much easier
to show you than to tell you.

393
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,166
If you would agree
to take a short visit

394
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,375
to the Continuum...

395
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:34,125
No, just tell me.

396
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:38,125
Well, to put it simply,
we're omnipotent.

397
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,125
There's nothing,
nothing we can't do.

398
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,875
And what do you do
with this power?

399
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:47,041
Anything we want.

400
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,583
Do you use it to help others?

401
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,667
I think you've missed the point,
my dear.

402
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,959
Clearly, you've spent
far too much time with humans.

403
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,750
As a Q, you can have
your heart's desire instantly,

404
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,208
whatever that may be.

405
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,417
Would you like precious jewels,
works of art?

406
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:08,375
Would you like to walk
along the rings of Tautine?

407
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,500
I'm not interested
in any of those things.

408
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:12,458
Of course not.
You're a Q.

409
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,291
But surely
there must be something

410
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,375
that you want--

411
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:21,583
something that you
never dreamed was possible.

412
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:26,166
Tell me, Amanda,
what is it?

413
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,250
I'd like to know

414
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,458
what my parents
looked like...

415
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,625
my real parents.

416
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,959
How quaint.

417
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,208
So do it.

418
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,166
What do you mean?
Summon the image.

419
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,458
I don't know how.
Think about them.

420
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,458
Evoke the memory.

421
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,333
You can do it, Amanda.

422
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,458
Trust me.

423
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,583
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes!

424
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,625
In your mind,
return to the time

425
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,834
when you were an infant.

426
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,166
Think about
your parents.

427
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,875
Remember them.

428
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:19,208
Good.

429
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,375
Good.

430
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:25,583
Now, open your eyes.

431
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,041
They loved me.

432
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,875
Wait for it
to be metabolized.

433
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:06,500
Add another... 20?

434
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:09,041
Wait for it to be
metabolized over and over

435
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,959
and then wait
till the bacilli

436
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,917
can't be absorbed
anymore.

437
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,917
That's right.

438
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,667
Just be sure and record

439
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:21,500
the rate of mitosis
from each of the dishes.

440
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,792
Mitosis, right.

441
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:28,625
You seem distracted.

442
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,709
Well, I just saw my parents...

443
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:35,417
my real parents.

444
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,333
Q showed me how.

445
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:42,291
Can you imagine
how that felt?

446
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,959
No, I don't think I can.

447
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,834
You know, you were right.

448
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,458
I can't ignore
what's happened to me.

449
00:21:56,792 --> 00:22:00,417
I just don't know
if I can cope with it.

450
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:06,375
Amanda, you are stronger
than you think.

451
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,041
You know...

452
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:15,959
when I saw them there,
right in front of me,

453
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,917
I realized
that I caused this to happen.

454
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,333
I wanted to see them

455
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,000
and I did.

456
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,792
If it were you--

457
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:29,291
if suddenly,

458
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:33,041
you could have
anything you wanted,

459
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,834
what would it be?

460
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:43,750
I have no idea.

461
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:45,166
No, think about it.

462
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,542
Really think.

463
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:51,583
If suddenly, you could make
anything happen,

464
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,375
what would it be?

465
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:57,333
Well, I would...

466
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,917
probably want to heal people--

467
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:03,625
people who are hopelessly ill.

468
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,166
Hmm.

469
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,583
Would you bring
your husband back?

470
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:24,250
Well, Amanda, I don't know.

471
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:30,333
And I don't think that I could
make a decision like that

472
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,875
until I was actually faced
with it.

473
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,792
I am faced with it.

474
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:47,041
Try to do the work.

475
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,250
I'll come back
and check on you later.

476
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:08,583
I thought she'd
never leave.

477
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,500
I don't know if I'll ever
get used to that.

478
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,583
It's time for
another lesson.

479
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,667
Well, I have to finish
this experiment first.

480
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:18,333
What are you doing?

481
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,750
We're delivering
live vaccine bacilli to Tagra.

482
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:24,458
I'm supposed to find
the best nutrient solution

483
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,000
so we can keep them living
while they're in stasis.

484
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,375
Fascinating.

485
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:31,291
Oh, I just had
a splendid idea.

486
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,083
Why don't we...

487
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,500
combine what you're
doing with our lesson

488
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,750
and we'll show you how
to finish in no time.

489
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,333
Well, I think that
I should finish it

490
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,709
the way Dr. Crusher
showed me first.

491
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,291
Oh, I'm sure
she'd be delighted

492
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,542
if we sped things along.

493
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,041
I mean, think
what it would mean.

494
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:49,250
You could double,
even triple the workload.

495
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,834
Well...

496
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,959
Good.
I guess so.

497
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,625
Now...

498
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:01,375
as you take a look
at the tissue samples,

499
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:05,500
form an image
in your mind.

500
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:11,166
Number One, Dr. Crusher has
some live vaccine bacilli

501
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:12,458
to be delivered to Tagra.

502
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,166
It'll have to be shipped
in a stasis field.

503
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,250
Will you make
the arrangements?

504
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:16,542
I'll get right on it.

505
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,417
Captain, message coming in
from Tagra IV.

506
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,625
On screen.

507
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:25,750
<i>Enterprise,</i>
I am Orn Lote, engineer.

508
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,291
We are having difficulties
with the reactor

509
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,125
that powers
the baristatic filters

510
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:31,542
on our southern continent.

511
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:34,166
We may have to shut it down
for repairs.

512
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,083
Perhaps my Chief Engineer
could be of assistance.

513
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,375
I hope so.

514
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:40,458
If we're forced
to disable the reactor,

515
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,792
it would take months to
reestablish the ionic currents

516
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,417
the filters have formed
in the atmosphere.

517
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,583
Send us
your design specifications.

518
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,083
I'm sure we'll be able
to help.

519
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:51,417
Thank you, Captain.

520
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,709
Captain?

521
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,959
What is it, Mr. Data?

522
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,417
I have some information

523
00:25:57,458 --> 00:26:00,667
regarding Amanda Rogers'
parents.

524
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:03,750
Records indicate that they
died in Topeka, Kansas.

525
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:06,041
Their home was destroyed
during a tornado.

526
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,625
Tornado?

527
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,250
Why wasn't it dissipated
by the weather modification net?

528
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,667
Unknown, sir.
The bodies were discovered

529
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:14,583
in the rubble after
the storm had passed.

530
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:17,041
See if you can find out
any more details, Mr. Data.

531
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,750
I'd like to know
more about that storm.

532
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,000
Aye, sir.

533
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,125
Well, if it isn't
Number Two.

534
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:29,041
I was looking
for Dr. Crusher.

535
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,291
I didn't know what nutrients

536
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,458
she wanted
to send with the bacilli.

537
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,667
Uh, I'm not sure.

538
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:35,917
I'll tell her
to contact you.

539
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,083
Thanks.

540
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,041
You could stay here...

541
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:43,417
and wait for her, if you,
you know, wanted to.

542
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:47,583
Just tell her
I'll be in Shuttle Bay Two.

543
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,917
You're attracted to him.

544
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,959
I am not.

545
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,625
I think you are.

546
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,500
How repulsive.

547
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

548
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:01,834
How do you stand
that hair all over his face?

549
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,291
Doctor,

550
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,959
Commander Riker was
just here looking for you.

551
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,625
He said he'd be
in Shuttle Bay Two.

552
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,333
Thank you.

553
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,000
Have you finished
already?

554
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,083
Yes.

555
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:12,250
How did you
do it so quickly?

556
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,375
Well, Q helped me.

557
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,709
It took us
about half the time

558
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,083
that it would have
normally taken us.

559
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:21,709
That explains this data.

560
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,333
I needed to know
the rates of mitosis.

561
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:27,667
By artificially inflating them,
you made the experiment useless.

562
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:29,917
Now I have to do it
all over again.

563
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:32,041
I'm sorry, Doctor.

564
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,875
Don't be sorry.

565
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:36,375
If she wants to make things
difficult on herself,

566
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:38,000
that's her business.

567
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,709
Why did you interfere
with what she was doing?

568
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,417
She's a Q.
Making her plod

569
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,667
through human chores
is beneath her.

570
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,834
CRUSHER:
She asked not to be
treated differently.

571
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,750
That doesn't mean she
should be bored to death.

572
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,041
I don't interfere with
what you're teaching her...

573
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,291
You would be incapable
of interfering.

574
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,291
...and I don't think
it's asking too much

575
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,250
that you do the same.

576
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:55,417
(<i> barking</i> )

577
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:58,125
...and you stay out of mine.

578
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:01,125
When you
put it like that, I...

579
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,375
I think you're
absolutely right.

580
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:11,375
Captain.

581
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:12,834
Yes, Mr. Data.

582
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,750
I have further information
regarding the tornado

583
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:16,333
that killed Amanda
Rogers' parents.

584
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,834
What is it?

585
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:21,125
It was unusually compact,
yet extremely powerful.

586
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,667
Its recorded wind velocity

587
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:24,083
was characteristic
of a funnel

588
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,750
three times its size.

589
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,250
Download the files
to my ready room.

590
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,542
I'll study them there.

591
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,709
Aye, sir.

592
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:36,041
Have you been practicing
your teleportation?

593
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,375
Yes, but it's kind of hard.

594
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,125
I keep ending up somewhere
I don't want to be.

595
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,917
Well, it won't do
to be sloppy.

596
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,333
We should hone
your abilities.

597
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:46,834
I have a wonderful idea.

598
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,166
Why don't we play
a little game?

599
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,750
I'll hide somewhere
on the ship

600
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:56,959
and you find me.

601
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,917
But how do I know how...?

602
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:02,041
Q:
<i>Don't worry, Amanda.</i>

603
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,709
<i>You can do it.</i>

604
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,000
Not bad.

605
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:17,041
Not bad at all.

606
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,750
If we can use
phase buffers,

607
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,959
we may be able
to devise a mechanism

608
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,583
that can be integrated
into the present system

609
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:28,041
while it is still
in operation.

610
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:35,458
You're still thinking
like a human.

611
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,500
Now do you understand?

612
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:02,083
What do humans
have to offer you

613
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:05,583
that even begins
to compare with that?

614
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,917
Your future
contains wonders

615
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:11,500
you can't even imagine.

616
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:16,875
The universe could
be your playground.

617
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:19,333
(<i> door chimes</i> )

618
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:22,208
Dr. Crusher
and Counselor Troi--

619
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,834
they're taking me to dinner.

620
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,041
You don't have
to eat, you know.

621
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:31,709
It's a nasty human habit
you could easily do without.

622
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:37,750
Hello, Amanda.

623
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,083
Are you ready?

624
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,041
Yes.

625
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:51,959
Well, Amanda, how
are you feeling
about all this now?

626
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,625
It must be overwhelming.

627
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,750
It was at first,

628
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:58,375
but actually,
now I'm enjoying myself.

629
00:30:58,417 --> 00:30:59,375
Hello, ladies.

630
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:00,625
Hello, Will.

631
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:05,333
Commander Riker,
um, won't you join us?

632
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,125
I'd love to, but
I have other plans.

633
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,041
Hi.

634
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:11,125
Hi.

635
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:21,333
So how are your
lessons going?

636
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,875
Is Q being patient with you?

637
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,291
Amanda?

638
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:40,458
What is this all about?

639
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,166
I thought it
might be nice

640
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,208
to spend some time
alone together.

641
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,375
I think it would be nice

642
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:49,500
if you took us
back to Ten-Forward.

643
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,959
Are you sure that
you wouldn't want

644
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,792
to stay here with
me for a while?

645
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:59,458
The moonlight
is so beautiful.

646
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,333
Isn't it nicer here
than at Ten-Forward?

647
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:07,000
Yes, it's very pleasant,
but that's not the point.

648
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:09,083
Oh.

649
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:15,333
I think it is.

650
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,709
No.

651
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:23,625
You can't snatch people
and put them into your fantasies

652
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:26,709
and expect them to respond.

653
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:30,750
Don't you like me?

654
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:34,583
Even just a little bit?

655
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:38,709
You're a very
lovely young lady,

656
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:43,875
but none of this is real.

657
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:48,750
(<i> sighs</i> ):
My feelings are real.

658
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:55,000
I know, but you can't
make someone love you.

659
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,083
Can't I?

660
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:03,750
Oh, Amanda...

661
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:06,875
you are so beautiful.

662
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:12,750
Do you love me?

663
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,291
More than anything.

664
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:27,792
You're right.

665
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:31,959
None of this is real.

666
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,208
I thought
it would be romantic,

667
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,625
but it's empty.

668
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:40,750
Amanda...

669
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:43,667
Just go back
to Ten-Forward.

670
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,709
<i>Bonjour, mon Capitain.</i>

671
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,583
You wanted to
speak with me?

672
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,917
I wanted to ask you about
Amanda's biological parents.

673
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:16,750
When they decided
to remain on Earth,

674
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:19,709
what was the reaction
in the Q Continuum?

675
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,125
We found it
incomprehensible.

676
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:24,667
Were they pressured to return?

677
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,375
Were they threatened
with any punishment

678
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:27,500
if they didn't?

679
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:29,417
What are you
driving at, Picard?

680
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:32,208
Well, the circumstance
of their death is quite odd.

681
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,542
A tornado somehow escaped
the weather modification net

682
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:39,959
and touched down
in only one spot--

683
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,583
Amanda's home.

684
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:44,667
Well, you can never
predict the weather.

685
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,709
Well, tornadoes develop
from existing storm fronts

686
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,041
but, you see,
there were no storm fronts

687
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,500
in Kansas that day.

688
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:54,667
Witnesses reported that
the funnel materialized

689
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:58,667
spontaneously,
directly over Amanda's home,

690
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:01,667
destroyed it, and disappeared.

691
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:07,125
If you say so.
I wasn't there.

692
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:11,250
Were Amanda's parents
executed by the Q Continuum?

693
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,000
And what if they were?

694
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,834
Well, I think she has
a right to know that

695
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,542
before she makes a choice
about her future.

696
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:22,875
Don't be foolish, Picard.

697
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:24,208
She has no choice.

698
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,917
She never did.

699
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,583
If she's truly Q,

700
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:30,458
then she must return
to the Continuum

701
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,792
where she belongs.

702
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:33,333
But if she were
some sort of a hybrid--

703
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:36,542
neither human
nor Q, then...

704
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:42,917
You would be so despicable?

705
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:44,500
Don't be naive.

706
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,333
You have no idea
what it means to be Q.

707
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,625
With unlimited power
comes responsibility.

708
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,083
Do you think
it is reasonable

709
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,083
for us to allow
omnipotent beings

710
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,375
to roam free
through the universe?

711
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:57,333
So what have you concluded?

712
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,500
Does she live

713
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:00,917
or does she die?

714
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:10,250
I haven't decided yet.

715
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:19,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46193.8.</i>

716
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:21,542
<i>We have arrived at Tagra IV</i>

717
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:23,625
<i>and have begun delivering</i>
<i>supplies.</i>

718
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:26,542
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>I am faced with a crisis</i>

719
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,083
<i>of a different nature.</i>

720
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:31,291
Look, I have no reason
to believe that Q is lying.

721
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:35,333
He claims he has orders
from the Continuum.

722
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:38,000
If Amanda cannot prove
that she is fully Q,

723
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,000
then he must kill her.

724
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,291
We have to tell her.

725
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,000
CRUSHER:
I don't know
if we should.

726
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,083
It almost seems cruel.

727
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,041
TROI:
Maybe she can
protect herself.

728
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,667
After all,
she has a great deal of power.

729
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:51,041
So did her parents,
it didn't save them.

730
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,125
I agree with the Counselor.

731
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,375
Amanda deserves to know
the truth of her situation.

732
00:36:58,417 --> 00:36:59,625
We have no right

733
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:02,667
to hold such crucial information
from her,

734
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:05,917
but it isn't going to be easy
telling her.

735
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:10,041
What is your impression

736
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,458
of the field modulator,
Mr. Lote?

737
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,250
Quite ingenious.
Quite ingenious indeed.

738
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:14,166
I...

739
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:16,542
(<i> coughs</i> )

740
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,333
I'm amazed at the way

741
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,500
it can be incorporated
with the existing system.

742
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,709
Commander, we're
all loaded here.

743
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,583
We can head for the surface
whenever you're ready.

744
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,041
I'm eager to see

745
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,291
the field modulator
in place, Commander.

746
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,542
(<i> coughs</i> )

747
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,417
(<i> inhaling deeply</i> )

748
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,417
We'd better get going.

749
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,917
Yes.

750
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,375
Kill me?

751
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:54,417
But why?

752
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:57,917
They're not convinced
that you are fully Q

753
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:01,375
and... they are
also responsible

754
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,000
for your parents' death.

755
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:06,458
My parents?

756
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,875
But what right do they have?

757
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,625
Q? Answer me.

758
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:21,291
Are you afraid to face me?

759
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,458
She's such a plucky
little thing

760
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,291
now, isn't she?

761
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,834
I really do enjoy you,
you know.

762
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,583
Amanda's question
deserves an answer, Q.

763
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,917
You've made yourself
judge and jury

764
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:37,625
and if necessary,
executioner.

765
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,917
By what right have you
appointed yourself

766
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:42,417
to this position?

767
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,417
Superior morality.

768
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,667
Oh, yes.

769
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:50,959
I recall how you used
your superior morality

770
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,458
when we first encountered you.

771
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,000
You put us on trial
for the crimes of humanity.

772
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,542
The jury is still out on that,
Picard.

773
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:59,083
Make no mistake.

774
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:02,709
Your... arrogant pretense

775
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,000
at being the moral guardians
of the universe

776
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,125
strikes me
as being hollow, Q.

777
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,375
I see no evidence

778
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:12,291
that you are guided
by a superior moral code

779
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,834
or any code whatsoever.

780
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,709
You may be
nearly omnipotent--

781
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,125
and I don't deny

782
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:20,375
that your parlor tricks
are very impressive--

783
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:23,458
but morality.... I don't see it.

784
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,375
I don't acknowledge it, Q.

785
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:29,917
I would put human morality
against the Qs any day.

786
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:32,125
And perhaps...

787
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:35,667
that's the reason
that we fascinate you so,

788
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:42,125
because our puny behavior
shows you a glimmer

789
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:46,000
of the one thing
that evades your omnipotence:

790
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:47,917
A moral center.

791
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:50,333
And if so,

792
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,542
I can think
of no crueler irony

793
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,583
than that you should destroy
this young woman

794
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,834
whose only crime
is that she's too human.

795
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,417
Jean-Luc...

796
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:06,250
sometimes I think
the only reason I come here

797
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:09,959
is to listen to these<i> wonderful</i>
speeches of yours,

798
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,333
but this time,
your concern is unwarranted.

799
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:17,458
We've decided not to harm her

800
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,709
and we are prepared
to offer her a choice.

801
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,542
What kind of choice?

802
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:26,667
You can either come
to the Continuum with me...

803
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:27,875
Or...?

804
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:32,291
Now,<i> this</i> choice
is more difficult.

805
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,417
You have it within yourself

806
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:38,083
to refrain from using
the power of Q.

807
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,583
If you can do that,
you can stay here.

808
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,458
Then I'm staying here.

809
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,500
Think about this.

810
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,083
This is not so easy.

811
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,208
Your parents
were given this choice

812
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,333
and they were unable to resist
the temptation

813
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:52,083
of using their power.

814
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,500
All I've wanted

815
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,917
since this whole
thing began

816
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:59,333
is to become a normal
human being again.

817
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,667
I know I can resist.

818
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,291
Worf to Picard.

819
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:06,166
There is an emergency message
from Commander Riker.

820
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,417
I'm on my way.

821
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,959
RIKER:
Captain, the damage
to the reactor is greater

822
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,750
than the Tagrans
led us to believe.

823
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:21,458
The field modulator
is installed and operational,

824
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,834
but it's not going to be enough.

825
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,709
The reactor has already gone
into overload.

826
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,041
Can you correct
the problem?

827
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,917
Geordi is trying
to stabilize the unit now.

828
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,625
We will stay
as long as possible.

829
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,291
There are thousands
of people in this area.

830
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:32,291
If that reactor goes...

831
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:35,291
Commander, over here,
quickly!

832
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:41,208
Is this your doing, Q?

833
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,709
Not this time, Picard.

834
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:46,542
Mr. Worf,
see if there is any way

835
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:47,834
that we can cut through
the interference

836
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,875
and beam them out of there.
Aye, sir.

837
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:53,083
Captain, Geordi is trying
a neutrino infusion.

838
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,834
It may smother the reaction.

839
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:57,458
WORF:
Captain, there is too much
ionization in the atmosphere.

840
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,667
Transporters are useless.

841
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:00,041
LA FORGE:
It's no use.

842
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,291
The heat has fused
the injectors shut.

843
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,375
We're losing containment.

844
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:04,250
RIKER:
How long till meltdown?

845
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,417
LA FORGE:
A few minutes at most.
We're going to have to...

846
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,291
LOTE:
Commander, look at this.

847
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:09,875
This is impossible.

848
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:12,208
Captain, I don't know
what's happening,

849
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,458
but the reaction is stabilizing
on its own.

850
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,041
DATA:
Captain,

851
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:21,166
I am reading
a massive energy fluctuation

852
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,792
in the planet's atmosphere.

853
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:24,667
On screen.

854
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,083
DATA:
Atmospheric contaminants

855
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:36,458
have dropped to less
than one part per trillion.

856
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,917
The ecosystem has been restored
to its natural state.

857
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:44,667
Amanda?

858
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,417
I told you it would be
harder to resist

859
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:54,375
than you thought.

860
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:58,125
I couldn't let all
those people die.

861
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,792
Ever since
I got here,

862
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:04,333
I've been fighting this.

863
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:07,834
I've been denying the truth...

864
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:10,875
denying what I am.

865
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:14,458
I am Q.

866
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:20,208
Dr. Crusher...

867
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,583
I've decided that I can't stay.

868
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:26,166
I can't stay here.

869
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:27,667
Well...

870
00:43:27,709 --> 00:43:30,375
now that you've come
to your senses,

871
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:31,792
let's go.

872
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:34,959
No. I want to go and
see my parents first.

873
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,250
It's going to take some
time to explain all of this,

874
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:39,709
so you'll have
to be patient.

875
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:59,333
I hope I can come back
and see you.

876
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,375
You're a Q.

877
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:03,959
You can do
anything you want.
