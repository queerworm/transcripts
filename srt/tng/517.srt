00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:06,291
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45614.6.</i>

2
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:09,083
<i>We have been contacted</i>
<i>by an androgynous race</i>

3
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,417
<i>called the J'naii</i>
<i>to investigate</i>

4
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:14,917
<i>the mysterious disappearance</i>
<i>of one of their shuttlecraft.</i>

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:18,458
Captain, we are approaching
the designated coordinates.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,250
On screen.

7
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,542
PICARD:
Long-range scan, Mr. Data.

8
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,375
Sensors find no evidence
of the shuttle

9
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:29,041
anywhere within the star system.

10
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,083
It couldn't have traveled
outside the system.

11
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,000
Mr. Data, reconfigure
high-resolution sweep.

12
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,250
Radius one million kilometers.
Check for any debris.

13
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,458
Scans find no debris
within that radius.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,917
I don't understand it.

15
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,959
A shuttle doesn't
simply vanish.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,291
There has to be an explanation.

17
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,875
DATA:
Captain...

18
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:48,959
I'm detecting
an unusual reading.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,834
It appears to be a neutrino
emission with no visible source.

20
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:53,875
Explanation.

21
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:55,417
DATA: I have none, sir.

22
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,333
I recommend we launch a probe.

23
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,291
Make it so.

24
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,250
Probe is launched.

25
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,750
Sensors show no evidence
of any unusual phenomenon.

26
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,500
The probe is
no longer transmitting.

27
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,458
J'NAII:
What happened?

28
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,500
Where did it go?

29
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:07,041
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

30
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:11,625
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

31
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:12,917
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

32
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,583
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

33
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:20,875
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

34
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:25,667
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

35
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,583
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

36
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,959
<i>The sudden disappearance</i>
<i>of our probe</i>

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,625
<i>suggests that we may have found</i>

38
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,667
<i>the first instance of what</i>
<i>is called "null space--"</i>

39
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,959
<i>an anomaly which, until now,</i>
<i>had been only theoretical.</i>

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,875
<i>Commander Riker has been</i>
<i>working around the clock</i>

41
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,959
<i>with a team</i>
<i>of J'naii specialists</i>

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,709
<i>to formalize this hypothesis.</i>

43
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,250
During the creation
of a star system,

44
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,000
when clouds of interstellar dust
and gas coalesce,

45
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,458
turbulent regions
of magnetic

46
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,667
and gravitational fields
may develop.

47
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,291
If certain conditions occur

48
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,917
these fields
can condense

49
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,166
into abnormal
pockets of space.

50
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,458
We think
your system contains

51
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,792
one of these
null pockets.

52
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:02,959
If we're right,
the pocket would absorb

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,250
electromagnetic energy from
anything that entered it.

54
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,250
J'NAII:
Like a shuttlecraft.

55
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,291
RIKER:
Or a probe.

56
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,667
Making them powerless.

57
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,500
But, outside the pocket

58
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,792
all the energy
is bent around it,

59
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,917
making it
naturally cloaked.

60
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,834
That's why we
cannot see it

61
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,333
and our sensors
cannot read it.

62
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,625
Is the shuttle still there?

63
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,166
RIKER:
We think so.

64
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,834
The shuttle probably was not
able to sustain its energy

65
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,709
but, other than that,
it wouldn't be damaged.

66
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,792
Since our
shuttles carry

67
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,542
plestorene-based
backup systems

68
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,834
we think life-support
would sustain

69
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,834
for as long
as ten days.

70
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,417
Then perhaps our crew
has survived.

71
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,542
We could send in
one of our own shuttles,

72
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,375
but its energy
would also be absorbed.

73
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,166
Our chief engineer
is working on a way

74
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,000
to maintain
the power reserves

75
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,750
long enough
to rescue your crew.

76
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,834
Commander...

77
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,834
we're grateful for your help.

78
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,709
Whatever resources
we can provide are yours.

79
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,000
I've been thinking.

80
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,417
When the time comes,

81
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,083
I would like to pilot
the shuttle.

82
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,667
It's a Starfleet craft.

83
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,125
I cannot ask you
to put yourself

84
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,333
in danger
to rescue our crew.

85
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,959
You can't pilot a shuttle
you're not familiar with.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,500
I happen to be
a good pilot.

87
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,500
I happen to be
a good pilot, too,

88
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:24,041
and I know my way around
the Starfleet shuttle.

89
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,041
So, what if we team up?

90
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,333
When can we go over
the shuttle flight operations?

91
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,959
Right now.

92
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,375
SOREN:
Is this the one?

93
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:42,250
RIKER: This is it.
Short-range craft.

94
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,709
Two 1250-millicochrane
warp engines.

95
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,291
Looks like
microfusion thrusters?

96
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,834
Right.
Armament?

97
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,166
None, usually, but this
one's been equipped

98
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:52,083
with two type-4
phaser emitters.

99
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,250
We'll use those to
chart the null space.

100
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,792
Chart it?

101
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:56,875
Mr. La Forge wants
to get an idea

102
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:58,291
of the size
of the pocket.

103
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,458
He thinks the rate
of energy absorption's

104
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,125
linked to its size.

105
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,792
I'm not sure
how we'd go about

106
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,125
mapping something
we can't see.

107
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,875
Well, that's where
the emitters come in.

108
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,625
We shoot out a series of
photon pulses into the pocket

109
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,208
and chart where
each one disappears.

110
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,083
From that, we should get
a fairly complete outline.

111
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,875
Let's have a look
at the controls.

112
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,875
Later, we'll try
a flight simulation.

113
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,250
Right now, let's
do a systems review.

114
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,458
I'll talk you through it.

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,625
Let me try it.

116
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,583
Propulsion system,
transfer conduits...

117
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,875
where's the schematic
reactor assembly?

118
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:35,875
Oh, there it is.

119
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,750
Engine nacelles.

120
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:40,291
There's nothing here
that's unfamiliar.

121
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,000
Navigational deflector,
redundant.

122
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,959
Graviton polarity
source generators...

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,542
You handle these
controls like you
grew up in a shuttle.

124
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,250
I did.

125
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,542
My parents were pilots.

126
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,500
I was flying with them
before I could walk.

127
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:54,542
As soon as I was old enough,
I entered flight school.

128
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,667
Krite was my instructor.

129
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,166
He had a good student.

130
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,375
"He?" Commander,
there are no he's or she's

131
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,208
in a species
without gender.

132
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay. For two days,
I've been trying to
construct sentences

133
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,333
without personal pronouns.

134
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,500
Now I give up.
What should I use, "it"?

135
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:10,875
To us, that's rude.

136
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:12,875
We use a pronoun
that is neutral.

137
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:16,333
I do not think
there is really a translation.

138
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,375
Well, then I'll just
have to muddle through.

139
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:22,750
So, forgive me if the stray
"he" or "she" slips by, okay?

140
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,625
Well, if that's
the systems review,

141
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,375
I don't see any problem.

142
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:28,166
What's next?

143
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,000
Lunch.

144
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,625
Thank you.

145
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:33,750
What is it?

146
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:34,875
Split pea soup.

147
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,250
It's my father's recipe.

148
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,542
I had it programmed
into the replicators.

149
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:43,542
Well?

150
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,333
Unusual...

151
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,542
but I think I like it.

152
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,083
It's very healthy.

153
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,083
Helps to keep you warm
on cold Alaskan nights.

154
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,500
We prefer to stay warm
by sleeping with a friend.

155
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,792
I see.

156
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,917
Not to mate.

157
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,417
Just to sleep together,
for warmth.

158
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,208
That still sounds better
than pea soup.

159
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,500
We are puzzling
to you, aren't we?

160
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,834
A little.

161
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,417
It's hard to grasp
the idea of no gender.

162
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:20,000
It is just as hard
for us to understand...

163
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,667
the strange division
in your species.

164
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,834
Males and females.

165
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,166
You are male?

166
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,166
Mm-hmm.

167
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,291
Tell me about males.

168
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,917
What is it makes you
different from females?

169
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,250
(<i> sighing</i> )

170
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,959
"Snips and snails
and puppy dog tails."

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,834
You have a dog's tail?

172
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,500
It's an old
nursery rhyme.

173
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,583
Girls are made
from sugar and spice

174
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,875
and boys are made
from snips and... snails.

175
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:56,917
That makes it sound
better to be female.

176
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,959
It's an old-fashioned way
of looking at the sexes--

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,583
not to say that there's no
real difference between them.

178
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:07,166
Physically, men are bigger,
stronger in the upper body.

179
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,625
We have different
sexual organs.

180
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,083
Men can't bear young.

181
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:15,417
And what about feelings
or emotional attitudes?

182
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,417
Are they different?

183
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,709
Most people think so,

184
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,000
but that's
the kind of question

185
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,417
it would take
a lifetime to answer.

186
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,917
Let me ask you.

187
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,667
What's it like
on a planet

188
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:30,250
where the people
have no gender?

189
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:34,125
I'm afraid
I don't understand.

190
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,458
Well...

191
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,125
Who leads when you
dance, if you dance?

192
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,333
We do...

193
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,542
and whosever taller leads.

194
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,834
Without the battle
of the sexes,

195
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,125
you probably don't have
as many arguments.

196
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,208
Just because
we don't have gender

197
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,291
doesn't mean
we don't have conflicts.

198
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,750
We are very
strong-minded.

199
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,583
We love a good fight.

200
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,500
From the sound
of it, there's not

201
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:02,750
that much difference
between our species.

202
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,875
Maybe not.

203
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:14,583
What kind of... woman
do you find attractive?

204
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,291
I like one who's intelligent
and sure of herself...

205
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,375
who I can talk with
and get something back.

206
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:25,333
But the most important
thing of all?

207
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,875
She has to laugh at my jokes.

208
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,208
Tell me...

209
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,083
is that the kind of woman
that all human males prefer?

210
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,375
Not at all.

211
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:40,041
Some like quiet,
demure women.

212
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,792
Others prefer
a lot of energy.

213
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:47,375
Some only respond
to physical attractiveness.

214
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,291
Others couldn't
care less.

215
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,917
There are no rules.

216
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,291
You make it sound
very complex.

217
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,583
Believe me, it is.

218
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,625
Well, perhaps
it is that complexity

219
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:02,000
which makes
the differences in the sexes

220
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,792
so... interesting.

221
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,959
Good evening, Commander.

222
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,291
Good evening.

223
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,834
Please take my place,
Krite.

224
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,875
I have to be going.

225
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:16,333
Thank you for going over
the flight protocols, Commander.

226
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,417
It was very helpful.

227
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,250
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

228
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,667
<i>Commander Riker</i>
<i>and the J'naii pilot</i>

229
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,792
<i>have set out to chart</i>
<i>the null space pocket.</i>

230
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,250
<i>If they are successful,</i>

231
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,417
<i>we can then proceed</i>
<i>with a rescue attempt.</i>

232
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,750
I've illuminated
Delta-Four grid map.

233
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,458
We'll start there
and expand.

234
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,959
Stand by
forward phaser array.

235
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,125
The pulse vanished
at Delta 4.2 by .3.

236
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,625
Firing second burst.

237
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,750
J'NAII:
Delta 4.4 by .5.

238
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,041
RIKER:
This is working.

239
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,834
Initiating computer
task handoff.

240
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:12,750
Commander, tell me
about your sexual organs.

241
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,750
Uh...

242
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:20,875
Is that an uncomfortable subject
for humans?

243
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:24,709
No, but it doesn't tend to be
a topic of casual conversation.

244
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,667
I'm interested
in your mating practices.

245
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:32,709
What is involved with two sexes?

246
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,875
Correcting course--
021,

247
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:37,375
mark 0.

248
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,750
Mating.

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,250
Right.

250
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,041
Well, it's pretty simple.

251
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,583
The men inseminate the women,
and the women carry the baby.

252
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:52,542
Our fetuses are incubated
in fibrous husks

253
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,125
which the parents inseminate.

254
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,542
From what we know
of other species,

255
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,375
our method is less risky,
and less painful.

256
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,417
And less enjoyable.

257
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,834
Less enjoyable?

258
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,667
For humans...

259
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:12,333
the sexual act brings
a closeness and intimacy.

260
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,041
It can be
a very pleasurable experience.

261
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,542
Inseminating a husk...

262
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:23,000
That's just the last step.

263
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:28,625
Mating is a long ritual for us,
full of variety and invention.

264
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,208
I assure you...

265
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,959
It is<i> extremely</i> pleasurable.

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,959
I'm picking up
neutrino emission

267
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,166
from within
the null space.

268
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,959
That may be coming
from our shuttle.

269
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,625
I'll note
these coordinates.

270
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:45,333
I wonder.

271
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,625
RIKER:
What?

272
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:51,375
If a human and J'naii
would be sexually compatible.

273
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,250
I don't know.

274
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,583
Of course,
it would never be permitted.

275
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,083
Why not?

276
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,458
The idea of gender--

277
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,667
it is offensive to my people.

278
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,750
You see, long ago,

279
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:07,458
we had two sexes, as you do.

280
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,375
But we evolved
into a higher form.

281
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:15,625
I don't mean to sound insulting,
but on my planet,

282
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:20,166
we have been taught
that gender is...

283
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,291
primitive.

284
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,291
Primitive?

285
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,250
Less evolved.

286
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,000
Maybe so.

287
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,625
But sometimes,
there's a lot to be said

288
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,500
for an experience
that's primitive.

289
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,709
Delta-Five grid map
is fully plotted.

290
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,000
Adjusting course--
029 mark 0.

291
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,792
The port engine's down!

292
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,125
Reducing power
to the starboard nacelle.

293
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,542
That's not enough.

294
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,125
I have to activate
the maneuvering thrusters.

295
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,375
Thrusters aren't responding.

296
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,083
I'll try to reroute
the firing sequence.

297
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,583
Inertial dampeners
are failing!

298
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,208
Hang on!

299
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,000
LA FORGE:
<i>Enterprise</i> to shuttle.
Do you read me?

300
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,917
Affirmative.
We've lost an engine.

301
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,375
We'll try to get
a tractor beam on you.

302
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:15,583
The sooner the better.

303
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,041
<i>Enterprise,</i>
we have an injury.

304
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,500
Transport Soren
directly to Sick Bay.

305
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:20,834
Right away, Commander.

306
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,834
It's just
a minor concussion.

307
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,917
You're going to be fine.

308
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,458
This will reduce
the inflammation.

309
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,166
Doctor?

310
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,375
You are female?

311
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,583
Yes.

312
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,041
Forgive me.

313
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,417
I do not mean to be rude,
but I'm curious.

314
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,709
What is it like?

315
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,959
Well, it's...

316
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,458
it's just the way I am.

317
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,917
I've never really thought
about what it's like.

318
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,208
I notice you tend
to have longer hair.

319
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,750
Hmm.

320
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:07,041
And you arrange it
more elaborately.

321
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,125
And you apply color
to your bodies.

322
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,250
Color?

323
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,750
You put color on your mouths

324
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:16,667
and your eyes,
your cheeks,

325
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,667
and your fingernails.

326
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:19,959
The men don't.

327
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,625
That's true.

328
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:26,166
Then it is up to women
to attract the men?

329
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,500
Oh, no.

330
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,625
Men want to be
attractive, too, believe me.

331
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,500
They just go about it
differently.

332
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:34,917
No color.

333
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,875
No color.

334
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:39,625
They like to pretend
they're not doing<i> anything</i>

335
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,458
to attract a woman,

336
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,458
even when it's the most
important thing on their minds.

337
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,333
This is very confusing.

338
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,709
Then...

339
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,875
are women considered
more superior?

340
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,458
Or the men?

341
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,709
Neither.

342
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,625
In the past...

343
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:06,959
women were often considered
weak and inferior.

344
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,834
But...

345
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,792
that hasn't been true
for a long time.

346
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,000
Will...

347
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,000
your copilot is
going to be fine.

348
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,750
The injury
was minor.

349
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,250
Glad to hear it.

350
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,375
I'm afraid you're not
rid of me yet, Commander.

351
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,542
I will be able

352
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,709
to complete
the mission.

353
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm glad
you're feeling better.

354
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,333
What happened?

355
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,000
What made the shuttle
go into a spin?

356
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,959
The port nacelle
must have nipped
one of the protrusions

357
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,125
from the null pocket
and shut it down.

358
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,291
Are we still on
schedule, then?

359
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,333
That depends
on how you're doing.

360
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,208
I'm fine. We should go
check the port engine.

361
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,125
Whoa.

362
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,875
I think we should get
the doctor's opinion first.

363
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,083
Doctor?

364
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,834
I don't see any problem.

365
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,166
But if you feel any symptoms--
headache, dizziness-- come back.

366
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,917
You have my word.

367
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,333
All right.

368
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:08,375
This hand, the game
is "Federation Day."

369
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,750
What is that?

370
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,417
Well, the Federation
was founded in 2161.

371
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,750
So...

372
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,792
twos, sixes and aces
are wild.

373
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:21,208
That is a woman's game.

374
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,834
Oh? Why is that?

375
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,333
All those wild cards.

376
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,000
They support a weak hand.

377
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,125
A man's game
has no wild cards.

378
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,375
Let me get this straight.

379
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,083
You're saying
it's a woman's game

380
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,333
because women are weak
and need more help?

381
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,709
Yes.

382
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,917
And just this afternoon,

383
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,667
I was insisting
to one of the J'naii

384
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:43,375
that those attitudes
were but a distant memory.

385
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,792
The J'naii...

386
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,417
they bother me.

387
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,542
Why, Worf?

388
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,166
Well, they
just do.

389
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,667
They're all alike.

390
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:54,458
No males, no females.

391
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,291
Well, I'm sure we're
just as strange to them.

392
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,333
Well, one of them seems to be
overcoming the differences,

393
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,500
at least in regards
to one of us.

394
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,375
What are you saying,
Doctor?

395
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:05,583
I could be wrong,

396
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,208
but I get
the definite impression

397
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,208
that Soren is attracted

398
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,834
to Commander Riker.

399
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,250
A human and a J'naii?

400
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,875
Impossible.

401
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,417
Why?

402
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,875
Good question.

403
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,333
Worf?

404
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,875
With all these wild cards

405
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:30,291
it is difficult to know
what is exactly in my hand.

406
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,792
However, I will
open with 50.

407
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,500
The portable transporter
array is in.

408
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:40,667
When we get into
the null space

409
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:42,458
we'll need to initialize it
before we can transport

410
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,125
the J'naii crew
onto this shuttle.

411
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,208
But there should still
be enough power left

412
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,208
to beam us all back
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

413
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,125
Is the buffer field
generator installed?

414
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,625
Not yet. Geordi thinks
that'll be ready

415
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,125
by 0800 hours tomorrow.

416
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,000
But before that,

417
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,417
we should see if we can
balance this engine.

418
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:02,125
Can you access
the starboard manifold thrust?

419
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,542
There.

420
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,917
Set the arc at 6.3.

421
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,166
I'll optimize the plasma flow.

422
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,667
Commander...

423
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:24,792
I'd like
to tell you something.

424
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,000
Something that's
not easy to say.

425
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,041
What's that?

426
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:38,291
I find you attractive.

427
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:44,917
I am taking a terrible risk
telling you that.

428
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:48,000
It means revealing
something to you,

429
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,959
something that, if it
were known on my planet

430
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,166
would be very dangerous
for me.

431
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:03,291
Occasionally,
among my people...

432
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:10,166
there are a few
who are born different--

433
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:16,500
who are throwbacks from the era
when we all had gender.

434
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,917
Some have strong
inclinations to maleness

435
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:24,208
and some have urges
to be female.

436
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,625
I am one of the latter.

437
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:33,083
I have to admit, I had
a feeling you were different.

438
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,375
I was hoping you would.

439
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:40,041
But in front of Krite
and the others,

440
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,083
I must be careful
not to reveal myself.

441
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,375
Why?

442
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,625
On our world,

443
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:47,583
these feelings
are forbidden.

444
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:51,792
Those who are discovered
are shamed and ridiculed.

445
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:56,000
And only by undergoing
psychotectic therapy

446
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:00,417
and having all elements
of gender eliminated

447
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:04,000
can they be accepted
into society again.

448
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:07,834
Those of us who
have these urges

449
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,208
live secret and guarded lives.

450
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,041
We seek each other out...

451
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,208
always hiding...

452
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,041
always terrified
of being discovered.

453
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:23,333
How long have you known
that you were like this?

454
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:28,125
I have known
I was different all my life,

455
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:33,500
but I did not know how
or why until I was older.

456
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,583
And when you realized--

457
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,583
what then?

458
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:42,125
I remember
when I was very young,

459
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,750
before I knew what I was,

460
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:48,333
there was a rumor
at my school

461
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:52,166
that one of the students
preferred a gender--

462
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,458
in that case, male.

463
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:00,583
The children started
making fun of him

464
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,208
and every day,
they were more cruel.

465
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,083
They could tell
he was afraid,

466
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:09,792
and somehow, that seemed
to encourage them.

467
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:16,917
One morning in class,
he appeared, bleeding

468
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,834
and in ripped clothes.

469
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,792
He said he had fallen down.

470
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:28,667
And, of course, the school
authorities found out

471
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,041
and took him away

472
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:34,041
and gave him
psychotectic treatments.

473
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:39,458
When he came back...

474
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,500
he stood in front
of the whole school

475
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:50,834
and told us how happy he was,
now that he had been cured.

476
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,959
After that, I realized

477
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,667
how dangerous it was
to be different.

478
00:23:56,709 --> 00:24:02,750
And once I got older
and knew what I was,

479
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:06,000
I was terrified.

480
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:10,709
I have had to live
with that fear ever since.

481
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,917
Do you have...

482
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:15,542
relationships with others?

483
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,041
Yes...

484
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:21,291
with those who have
discovered they are male.

485
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:24,041
I have had
to live a life

486
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,959
of pretense and lies

487
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,041
but with you,
I can be honest.

488
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:34,083
Please, don't
say anything.

489
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,834
Just think about it.

490
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:50,375
That's it, Commander.
Everything checks out.

491
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:53,041
The energy buffer
is installed and functioning.

492
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,625
I estimate it should
reduce the power drain

493
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,125
to your systems
by about 40%.

494
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,625
Any guess
how long we'll have?

495
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,583
Let's just say you don't
want to waste any time

496
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,667
once you get in there.

497
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,041
You'll have to give him

498
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,333
continuous readouts
on energy consumption.

499
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:04,625
I can't even predict
if the drain

500
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,000
will<i> be</i> at a constant rate.

501
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,041
I understand.

502
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,333
Then that's it.

503
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,041
Commander, I'll monitor you
as far as I can

504
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,291
but, once you get inside
that pocket, you're on your own.

505
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,875
We don't have any
idea what condition

506
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:15,250
the shuttlecraft
crew is in,

507
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:16,709
so we'll all beam
directly to sick bay.

508
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,834
I'll notify Dr. Crusher
to be standing by.

509
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,083
La Forge to bridge.

510
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,792
PICARD:
Picard here.

511
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,000
We're ready to initiate
shuttle prelaunch sequence.

512
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,875
Proceed, Mr. Data.

513
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:33,000
Initiating
prelaunch sequence.

514
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:36,083
RIKER:
Request flight clearance.

515
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,917
Clearance is granted.

516
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:40,250
The shuttle is
underway, sir.

517
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:41,792
Good hunting,
Commander.

518
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:44,500
RIKER:
Thank you, sir.
See you for dinner.

519
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,750
Heading confirmed.

520
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:47,458
Energy readings
are normal

521
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,542
with power reserves
stabilized at 100%.

522
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,000
Acknowledged.

523
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,250
It's dead ahead.

524
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,291
Approximately
50 kilometers.

525
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:58,208
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>
We're taking her in.

526
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:05,083
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

527
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,875
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

528
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:12,583
Power reserves
are down to 84%.

529
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:13,583
Look.

530
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,583
Try hailing them.

531
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,959
Calling the<i> Taris Murn.</i>

532
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,875
Do you read me?

533
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:23,000
(<i> console beeping</i> )

534
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,166
I'm getting sensor readings.

535
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,709
They're unconscious,
but they're alive.

536
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,000
Stand by.

537
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,667
I'm going to transport
them over here.

538
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:32,709
Power reserves at 68%
and dropping.

539
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

540
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,166
The null space
must be affecting

541
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,917
the annular
confinement beam.

542
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,667
We used ten megajoules
with that attempt.

543
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:46,125
We're down to 34%
of reserves.

544
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,834
We can give it one more try.

545
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,500
More than that,
we won't have enough power

546
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:51,208
to get ourselves out of here.

547
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,041
They need
medical attention quickly.

548
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,041
Okay, stand by to transport
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

549
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,250
Here we go.

550
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,875
Energy consumption?

551
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,542
We're down to nine percent.

552
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,500
We don't have enough
to get back.

553
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:15,959
If we just sit here, we'll
lose all of our systems

554
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,917
within an hour,
including life-support.

555
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:22,000
Okay, I'm rerouting
the propulsion system
to the transporter.

556
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,625
Rechannel
the navigation systems.

557
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:27,542
Let's transfer
every microjoule
of energy we've got.

558
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:28,709
Sensors... life-support.

559
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,250
This might give us
one last shot.

560
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:32,875
But if we use
an energy shift

561
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,333
of that size, it will overload
the phase compensators.

562
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,375
The shuttle...

563
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:36,583
...will explode.

564
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,875
But if we stay here,
we're dead, anyway.

565
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:41,417
Maximum energy levels,
five seconds.

566
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,959
(<i> consoles beeping</i> )

567
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,792
See you in a minute.

568
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:06,166
CRUSHER:
They've been
oxygen deprived.

569
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:08,583
But there doesn't seem
to be any significant damage.

570
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,792
Prepare some dexalin.

571
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:10,875
Yes, Doctor.

572
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:13,875
Commander...

573
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:15,125
Thank you.

574
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,417
Your colleague, Soren,
was very helpful.

575
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:20,125
Captain, would you all join us
this evening?

576
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,709
We would like to express
our gratitude.

577
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,875
We'd be happy to.

578
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:28,333
Noor will be eager
for a firsthand report.

579
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,375
We should return
to the surface.

580
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,166
I will see you later
tonight, Commander.

581
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,125
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

582
00:28:57,917 --> 00:29:01,417
There you are,
Commander.

583
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:02,542
I wondered
what had happened

584
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:03,542
to our guest of honor.

585
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:05,083
I just needed some air.

586
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,375
I can only take so much
of those social functions,

587
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:09,166
and then I need
to breathe a little.

588
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:13,375
I would think you had attended
so many affairs like this

589
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,667
that it had
become second nature to you.

590
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:17,375
I was raised outdoors.

591
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:20,792
I've never been very...
comfortable in crowded rooms.

592
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:34,875
What do you think
of our planet?

593
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,917
Isn't it beautiful?

594
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,792
Yes, it is.

595
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:40,417
It's beautiful.

596
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:47,125
We have many varieties
of plant life.

597
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:51,208
Perhaps you would like
to inspect some of them?

598
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,625
Yes, I would.

599
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:56,458
I've always been interested
in exobotany.

600
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,750
Please, let me
take you on a tour.

601
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:00,959
Thank you.

602
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,750
It's kind of you.

603
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:19,375
One of my favorites
is this menellen tree.

604
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,959
The leaves first
turn pure white

605
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,542
and then blue when
the weather gets cold.

606
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:29,166
This is called
a falla bush.

607
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,125
It produces
a fragrant flower

608
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:34,166
on only one day
of the year.

609
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:05,291
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45620.4.</i>

610
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,667
<i>In the hope that a detailed map</i>
<i>of the null space</i>

611
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,500
<i>will prevent</i>
<i>the loss of other ships,</i>

612
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:13,458
<i>we remain in orbit of J'naii,</i>

613
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,333
(<i> door chimes</i> )

614
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,417
Come in.

615
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,250
Hello, Will.

616
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:30,875
What's all this?

617
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:33,041
Wonderful things.

618
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,542
My mother sent me a box

619
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:38,583
that belonged to one
of my father's ancestors.

620
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:43,375
It was stored on Earth
and just recently turned up.

621
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:44,750
Do you know who any
of these people are?

622
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:46,542
No.

623
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,917
Some of the pictures
have names on,

624
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:51,125
but most of them don't.

625
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:54,959
I look at these faces,
and I wonder who they are

626
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,750
and if they could be
related to me.

627
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,291
Well, this one looks
like you.

628
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,417
Deanna...

629
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,500
I have something
on my mind.

630
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:07,709
I had to see you.

631
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,041
Has something happened?

632
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:13,000
I've met someone--

633
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:15,625
someone who's becoming
important to me.

634
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:19,208
Soren.

635
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,750
Yes.

636
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,792
You're my friend,
and I thought...

637
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:27,959
I don't know,
I thought I should tell you.

638
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,959
I'm glad you did.

639
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,625
Nothing will change
between us, will it?

640
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,041
Of course it will.

641
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:37,625
All relationships are
constantly changing.

642
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:45,000
But we'll still be friends,
maybe better friends.

643
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:48,333
You're a part of my life,
and I'm a part of yours.

644
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,583
That much will
always be true.

645
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:17,625
Hello.
I'm here to see Soren.

646
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:20,375
I know.

647
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,917
We had an appointment.
We were going to discuss...

648
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,542
I don't think so,
Commander.
Excuse me?

649
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,917
We know about the two of you.
We know what you're doing.

650
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:28,542
Where is Soren?
And we're going to make sure

651
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,709
it doesn't happen again.
Answer me-- where is Soren?

652
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,083
In custody.

653
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,709
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

654
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,917
The hell there isn't.

655
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:42,208
You are aware of
the charges against you?

656
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,291
Yes.

657
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,750
Do you intend
to dispute them?

658
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,041
Well?

659
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,291
What is your response?

660
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:57,750
Commander Riker,

661
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:59,083
these proceedings
are closed to everyone...

662
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,291
I think I just
opened them.

663
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,375
Sir, this is
a private matter.

664
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:03,750
We are grateful
for your recent help

665
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,208
but that gives you no right
to interfere

666
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,750
with our personal
concerns.

667
00:34:06,792 --> 00:34:08,917
I just want you to know
what really happened.

668
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:11,500
It was all my fault.

669
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:13,333
I was attracted to Soren.

670
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:15,375
I pursued.

671
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:16,709
I insisted.

672
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,834
I didn't understand
your ways until she

673
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:21,583
explained them to me
and rejected me.

674
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,625
Nothing happened
between us.

675
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:26,125
I ask your
forgiveness.

676
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:28,291
I behaved...

677
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,250
inappropriately.

678
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,625
Is this true?

679
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,959
No.

680
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,333
Soren.

681
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,709
I am tired of lies.

682
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:51,458
I am female.

683
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,959
I was born that way.

684
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,041
I have had those feelings...

685
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,291
those longings...

686
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,041
all of my life.

687
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:06,166
It is<i> not</i> unnatural.

688
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:10,917
I am not sick because
I feel this way.

689
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:13,250
I do not need
to be helped.

690
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:17,834
I do not need
to be cured.

691
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:24,917
What I need...

692
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:30,166
and what all of those
who are like me need...

693
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:33,709
is your understanding...

694
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,875
and your compassion.

695
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:41,959
We have not
injured you in any way.

696
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:47,166
And yet we are scorned
and attacked.

697
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,709
And all because
we are different.

698
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:55,500
What we<i> do</i> is no different
from what you do.

699
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:59,834
We talk...

700
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,667
and laugh.

701
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,083
We complain about work.

702
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,250
And we wonder about growing old.

703
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:13,333
We talk about
our families

704
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:18,542
and we worry about the future.

705
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:22,333
And we cry with each other
when things seem hopeless.

706
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:28,208
All of the loving things
that you do with each other--

707
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,709
that is what<i> we</i> do.

708
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,959
And for that,
we are called misfits

709
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,792
and deviants
and criminals.

710
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:45,625
What right do you have
to punish us?

711
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,333
What right do you have
to change us?

712
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,500
What makes you think

713
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:58,667
you can dictate
how people love each other?

714
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,291
I congratulate you, Soren.

715
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,000
Your decision
to admit your perversion

716
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:16,417
makes it much more likely
that we can help you.

717
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,625
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't have to do this.

718
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,417
Commander...
Let me take her with me.

719
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,125
She could go back
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

720
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,542
We would give her asylum.

721
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:27,959
You would never
have to see her again.

722
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,583
That would solve the problem,
wouldn't it?

723
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,083
You'd be rid of her!

724
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,333
She would never be able
to influence anyone again.

725
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,667
Commander...

726
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:36,208
after Soren's diatribe,

727
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,083
you must think that we are
a cruel, repressive people.

728
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:41,125
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

729
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,667
I'm just trying
to find a solution

730
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:44,834
that would satisfy everyone.

731
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:46,166
We're concerned
about our citizens.

732
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,875
We take our obligations
to them seriously.

733
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:51,458
Soren is sick, and sick people
want to get well.

734
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,917
Did it occur to you

735
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:54,333
that she might like
to stay the way she is?

736
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,667
No, you don't understand.

737
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:59,834
We have a very high success rate
in treating deviants like this.

738
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:03,750
And, without exception,
they become happier people

739
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:05,834
after their treatment,
and grateful

740
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:08,667
that we care enough
to cure them.

741
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:11,166
You see, Commander,
on this world

742
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:14,834
everyone<i> wants</i>
to be normal.

743
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,000
She<i> is!</i>

744
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:20,667
Take Soren to quarters.
Treatment will begin tomorrow.

745
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:22,125
RIKER:
Don't do this.

746
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,458
Soren!

747
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,041
No more, Commander.

748
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,542
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

749
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,083
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

750
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:37,834
One to transport.

751
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,208
I can't just
leave her there.

752
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,417
They'll give her
these psychotectic treatments.

753
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,166
I don't know
what to do!

754
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:58,875
Well, I could
talk to Noor.

755
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:01,750
Perhaps there's a way
to work something out.

756
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,500
Sir, their minds
are set.

757
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,333
They don't want to hear
another alternative.

758
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:06,542
Then I'm not sure

759
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,542
that there's much
that we can do.

760
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,667
There has to be.

761
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:13,792
My relationship with Soren
is not trivial.

762
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,625
She's very important to me.

763
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,250
It's my fault
that this happened.

764
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,792
I have to help her.

765
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:20,458
Will, if you're
here for sanction

766
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,875
to take matters
into your own hands

767
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:23,375
I can't give it to you.

768
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:26,417
I know that,
but I have to do something.

769
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,875
Interfering in the internal
affairs of the J'naii

770
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:31,083
is prohibited by
the Prime Directive.

771
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,166
I'm aware of that.

772
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,250
If you violate
it, you may be

773
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,917
jeopardizing
your career.

774
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,250
Starfleet doesn't
take these matters

775
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,041
lightly, Will, and
I can't defend you

776
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,333
if you go too far.

777
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:42,291
Do you understand?

778
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:45,500
You've made yourself
very clear, sir.

779
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:48,333
Don't put at risk
everything you've worked for.

780
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:51,125
Thank you.

781
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:52,542
May I be excused now?

782
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:55,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

783
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:07,041
(<i> door chimes</i> )

784
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,250
Who is it?

785
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,083
Lieutenant Worf.

786
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:13,166
Come in.

787
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,875
Commander, I have the plan

788
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:24,041
for deploying warning buoys
around the null space.

789
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,917
Fine, leave it.
I'll take a look at it later.

790
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:27,125
Yes, sir.

791
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,000
Thank you.

792
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:35,291
You're dismissed.

793
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,625
Commander, I am aware
of what transpired

794
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:40,458
on the planet's surface.

795
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,834
Are you, by any chance,
considering an...

796
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,792
unannounced visit?

797
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,500
I will go with you.

798
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:52,166
Lieutenant...

799
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:53,542
Sir, you are
my commanding officer.

800
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,250
If you order me
to stay on board, I will obey,

801
00:40:56,291 --> 00:41:00,500
but I ask you
not to give that order.

802
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:05,625
A warrior does not let
a friend face danger alone.

803
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,333
RIKER:
Something's happening.

804
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,834
They're leaving.

805
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:31,834
(<i> murmuring voices</i> )

806
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:42,959
Okay.

807
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:45,917
Excuse me.

808
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:47,583
I need to speak to her
alone for a moment.

809
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,166
(<i> grunting</i> )

810
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,208
Wait!

811
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,417
Don't worry.

812
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:01,041
We'll be out of
here in a minute.

813
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,417
Please don't.

814
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:04,291
All right.
We're almost there.

815
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,208
You cannot do this.

816
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,750
I won't let them hurt you.

817
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:12,333
You'll be safe on
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

818
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:15,625
I am so sorry.

819
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,083
It was my fault

820
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:18,750
that you got involved
in all this.

821
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:20,083
Everything's going
to be all right.

822
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:22,250
Everything's
going to be fine.

823
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,333
No.

824
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,709
It is not.

825
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,875
What are you
talking about?

826
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:32,083
It was all a mistake...

827
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:35,542
and I should have realized it
from the beginning.

828
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:36,709
What?

829
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,375
That I was sick.

830
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:40,667
I had these terrible urges

831
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:42,959
and that is why
I reached out to you.

832
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,375
But it was wrong,

833
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:48,667
and I see that now.

834
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:50,375
I do not understand

835
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:53,750
how I could have done
what I did.

836
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:55,458
Maybe Dr. Crusher
could treat you

837
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,500
and bring you back
to the way you were.

838
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,125
Why would I want that?

839
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,959
Soren...

840
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:12,166
I love you.

841
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:16,291
I'm sorry.

842
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:30,417
How long to the Phelan system,
Mr. Data?

843
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:33,834
At warp six,
53 hours, sir.

844
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,125
Commander.

845
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:38,166
Captain.

846
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,375
Starfleet has sent a message

847
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,083
asking us to proceed
to the Phelan system

848
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:43,041
to negotiate
a trade agreement.

849
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:45,417
Yes, sir.

850
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:49,583
I didn't know when to tell
them we would be there.

851
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,875
Is our business
with the J'naii finished?

852
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,250
Finished, sir.

853
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,208
Very well.

854
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,917
Ensign, take us out of orbit.

855
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:02,000
Set a course for
the Phelan system.

856
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:03,291
Warp six.

857
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:05,583
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

858
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:07,250
PICARD: Engage.
