1
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:05,750
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42695.3.</i>

2
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:07,291
<i>We're the first manned vessel</i>

3
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:10,166
<i>to enter</i>
<i>the Selcundi Drema sector.</i>

4
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,625
<i>Unmanned probes have</i>
<i>recorded unusual levels</i>

5
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:16,542
<i>of geological activity</i>
<i>in all five planetary systems.</i>

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:20,333
<i>I am hoping the Enterprise will</i>
<i>find the answer to this enigma.</i>

7
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:24,250
Commander, I've been reviewing
the unmanned probe scans.

8
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,000
At some point
during the last 150 years,

9
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:30,125
the fifth planet
of Selcundi Drema has shattered,

10
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,250
forming an asteroid belt.

11
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,625
I'd call that
geological instability.

12
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,375
Is there any indication
that this is the work

13
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:38,166
of an unknown
intelligence?

14
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,750
This is geology,
not malevolence.

15
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:43,500
These planets live fast
and die hard.

16
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:46,166
The question is why.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,959
You sure won't reconsider?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,875
No. I'll just watch you
and be impressed.

19
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:58,041
Optimistic vote of confidence
from the non-rider.

20
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,583
You know
I never particularly thought
of you as an animal person.

21
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,333
Small animals, no.

22
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,333
But horses...

23
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,792
Computer, program the holodeck
for a woodland setting

24
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:15,291
with a bridle path
and an appropriate mount.

25
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,208
Type of mount...
Andorian Zabathu?
Klingon Sark...?

26
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,417
Horse, Earth horse.

27
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:20,458
Breed?

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,583
Arabian.

29
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,166
The Arabs believed that Allah

30
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,709
gathered the South winds
and made the horse.

31
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,250
On the holodeck, we've made
that legend come true.

32
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,750
I like that.

33
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:36,125
Oh yes, computer,
English tack

34
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,083
and I will control
the animal myself.

35
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,458
Enter when ready.

36
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,125
So you like horses
for the romance.

37
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,250
Oh it goes deeper than that.

38
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:53,041
A fine war horse would sleep
in a Bedouin's tent,

39
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,875
carry him into battle,

40
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:57,917
feed his children
with her milk.

41
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,834
There's a bond which is
created by mutual need.

42
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,959
Hello, beautiful.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,500
Now I understand.

44
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:12,709
You don't want
the comfort of a pet,

45
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,500
you want a companion.

46
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:16,250
Thank you.

47
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,375
I don't want
to anthropomorphize anything.

48
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:26,250
It seems that some creatures
have the capacity

49
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:31,208
to fill spaces
you never knew were empty.

50
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,500
I had a Betazoid
kitten once.

51
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:38,583
My mother and the cat reacted
badly to one another.

52
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,625
Sure you don't want to try?

53
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,375
It's very relaxing.

54
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:52,250
We can find you something
that will be quiet and gentle.

55
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,166
No I prefer a mode
of transportation

56
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,667
that doesn't have
a mind of its own.

57
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,667
Strange.

58
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,583
I would expect Betazoids to be
outstanding animal trainers.

59
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,250
We become too involved

60
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,125
in the thoughts and shifting
passions of the beast.

61
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,333
We lose our way
and get swept up in emotion.

62
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:15,125
I would have thought the
shifting passions of this beast

63
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,208
would be far more terrifying.

64
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,542
RIKER:
Captain.

65
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,792
Yes, Number One?

66
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,417
We've entered
the first system.

67
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,166
I think you might
want to come to the Bridge.

68
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,500
Something interesting?

69
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,291
Spectacular,
and a little terrifying.

70
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,667
I'm on my way.

71
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,959
(<i> door opens</i> )

72
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:05,875
The first long-range reading,
magnification ten to the sixth.

73
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:06,959
Quite impressive.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,583
And deadly.

75
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,417
The last unmanned probe showed
a thriving ecosystem.

76
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,208
Now, there's nothing.

77
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,875
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

78
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:43,417
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

79
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,834
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

80
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,542
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

81
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:53,709
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

82
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,834
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

83
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,750
This is Commander
Riker's meeting.

84
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
I'll need your advice
and your recommendations.

85
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,208
As you know I have been
given the responsibility

86
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,792
of overseeing
Wesley's education.

87
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,000
To further that goal,

88
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,208
I would like
to put him in charge

89
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,417
of the planetary mineral
surveys.

90
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,583
That's a big job
with a lot of responsibility.

91
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,291
The game isn't big enough
unless it scares you a little.

92
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,250
To do the job,
Wesley is going to need a team.

93
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,667
It takes command
presence to lead.

94
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:28,250
You think he's ready for that?

95
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,458
Leadership grows
from self-confidence,

96
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,583
which is also part of
a Starfleet officer's education.

97
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,917
All of this is true.

98
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,041
But there's
an old horse trainer's adage

99
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,709
about putting too much weight
on a young back.

100
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,000
We don't want him
to break under pressure.

101
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,458
PULASKI:
We seem to be shifting
the focus here.

102
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,875
Are we talking about
a young officer

103
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:51,000
on the fast track
to the academy,

104
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,208
or are we talking
about a young man

105
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,041
that we're guiding through
adolescence and into adulthood?

106
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,417
TROI:
You can't guide
someone into adulthood.

107
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,291
The experiences are unique
to each person.

108
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,291
Whether Wes succeeds
or fails,

109
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,375
he will learn
from the experience.

110
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,125
I agree.

111
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,083
I'm just questioning
the speed at which we're moving.

112
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,500
You think we're pushing him
too hard?

113
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:15,041
I think that's a valid concern.

114
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,542
Tempering is taken
to extremes.

115
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,208
He is a boy, not a sword.

116
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,208
Who will one day become a man.

117
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,166
And to extend the metaphor

118
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,959
will need a fine edge
that won't dull

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,417
at the first touch
of resistance.

120
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,959
Sooner or later he'll have
to feel the burden of command.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,083
Ensign Crusher,

122
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,250
report to the observation
lounge.

123
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,375
RIKER:
Wesley,

124
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,667
I've assigned you the command

125
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,500
of the planetary
mineral surveys.

126
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,834
Sir?

127
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,333
Thank you, sir.

128
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,709
Well, you may not thank me

129
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,250
after you see how much work
it entails.

130
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,709
Assemble a team.

131
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,625
Take a look at the records
of the Drema Quadrant.

132
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,125
There's a mystery here.

133
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,625
We've got to solve it.

134
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:25,041
Yes, sir.

135
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,125
A team, sir?

136
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,458
Ensign, this is a serious
responsibility.

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,834
I know, sir.

138
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,583
These officers are here
to assist you.

139
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,000
Not judge,

140
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,542
help you.

141
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,709
You should make use
of them.

142
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,333
They are a valuable resource.

143
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,750
And by the way,

144
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,333
I respect an officer

145
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:50,625
who is prepared to admit
ignorance and ask a question

146
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,041
rather than one who,
out of pride,

147
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,166
will blunder blindly forward.

148
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,792
I understand, sir.

149
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,333
Ensign.

150
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,125
You're dismissed.

151
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,458
I'll try not
to disappoint you.

152
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,291
WORF:
Is this part
of your regular duties?

153
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,542
No, it is a personal project.

154
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,583
I have reset the sensors
to scan for frequencies

155
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,208
outside their usual range.

156
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,125
Hmm. Such as?

157
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,166
The dips and peaks

158
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,917
of the galaxy's
magnetic field,

159
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,208
organic molecules
in nebular clouds,

160
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,000
energetic cosmic rays.

161
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,583
Interesting.

162
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,709
Would these scans also detect
artificial transmissions

163
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,458
as well as naturally
occurring signals?

164
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,709
Of course.

165
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,834
Good.

166
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,041
Those signals
are very faint

167
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,083
and difficult to distinguish
from background noise.

168
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,875
That is why I am
boosting the power.

169
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,166
I will be removing
that equipment to my quarters.

170
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,333
Good.

171
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,750
<i>( chuckles )</i>

172
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,333
Hi, can I walk with you?

173
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,542
Yes.

174
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,750
I need a little advice.

175
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,875
Well, it's free.

176
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,125
Walking or advice?

177
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,166
Both.

178
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,834
It's about my team.

179
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,583
I'm considering so many factors,
I'm confusing myself.

180
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,875
What have you done so far?

181
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,500
Well, I've broken
down the task

182
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:37,750
and picked the best people
in those disciplines.

183
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,417
So who have you got
so far?

184
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,583
I've got Prixus in mineralogy
and metallurgy.

185
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,917
Alans and Hildebrant for
volcanology and geomechanics.

186
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,333
I want Davies
for geo-chemistry, but...

187
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,333
TROI:
But they're all much
older than you are.

188
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,959
Right. And it makes me
feel strange. I mean...

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,917
what do I do
about personality conflicts?

190
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,917
Completely irrelevant.
These people are professionals.

191
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,375
If there's
a personality conflict,

192
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:58,000
you're in charge--
you settle it.

193
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,709
So you not only have
to understand the job,

194
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,250
you also have to be
a ship's counselor?

195
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,667
Sometimes.

196
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,583
Well, thank you.

Who else is on it?

209
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,500
I have Prixus, and Alans,
and Hildebrant.

210
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,959
Ah, it's a shame you didn't
talk to me first.

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,792
It's just personal opinion,

212
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,917
but I like to break up
married teams.

213
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,291
Hmm,
I hadn't thought of that.

214
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,333
Don't worry.

215
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,041
They'll probably
work out fine.

216
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,834
And, uh, if you need any help,
just give me a signal

217
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,500

too beat up

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,542

220
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:27,500
Uh... thanks, but I'm
pretty sure I'll be all right.

221
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,166

Wes.

239
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,208
Hi, Dr. Pulaski.

240
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,709
Is there trouble
behind that door?

241
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,250
My team's in there.

242
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,625
I've got to assign planets,
set a schedule.

243
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:56,041
It sounds like you've got
everything under control.

244
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,417
I haven't had to deal
with them yet.

245
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,917
Not together,
not professionally.

246
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,625
Wes, the minute you walk
through that door,

247
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,083
they're your team.

248
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,750
You have nothing
to prove.

249
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,125
You've got the authority.

250
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,000
That's just 'cause
Commander Riker says I do.

251
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:12,041
It's up to you
to hang on to it.

252
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,458
You better get in there.

253
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,542
And Wes...

254
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,917
for whatever it's worth,

255
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,041
I think you're
gonna do just fine.

00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,083
It seems to me
at this point

262
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,750
we can expect the greatest
tectonic stresses.

263
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:50,166
I agree.
Nice job.

264
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,875
Here are the results of my scan
on the third Selcundi system.

265
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:55,583
It's just the same old song.

266
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,667
Didn't you tell me that U.V.
absorptions like these

267
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:00,709
are indicative
of Traker deposits?

268
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,583
And where there's Traker,
there's generally Dilithium?

269
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,250
Yes, I did.

270
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,041
So don't you think we ought
to run an ico-spectrogram?

271
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,500
Well, Wes, these Traker readings
are really faint.

272
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:09,125
It's probably just
a fool's echo.

273
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,959
Well, I think I'd still
run an ico-gram.

274
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,917
Wesley, it's
a major undertaking
to set up the scanner.

275
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,500
We're looking at five hours,
minimum.

276
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:18,041
I know, I know. I don't want to
do a halfway job.

277
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,917
Well, Wes,
there's being thorough,

278
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:21,166
and then there's
wasting time.

279
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,083
It's also the mark
of a good officer

280
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,500
to recognize the difference.

281
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,959
Maybe you're right.

282
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:43,291
Computer, please access

283
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,500

plate activity in Drema 4.

Data.

288
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,500
An excellent steed, sir.

289
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,750
Sorry to disturb you,
Captain.

290
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,125
That's quite all right.

291
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,750
It must be important,
or you wouldn't be here.

292
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,583
Yes, sir, it is important.

293
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,542
Very.

294
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,917
Eight weeks ago,
I received a transmission--

295
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,709
a simple four-word message,
"Is anybody out there?"

296
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,083
I answered it.

297
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,709
There is a...

298
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,750
a loneliness...

299
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:17,333
inherent in that whisper
from the darkness.

300
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,208
Yes, sir.

301
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,208
I am glad you understand, sir.

302
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,500
But it didn't end there.

303
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,125
No, sir.

304
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,375
We speak often.

305
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:33,583
It is a young female,
humanoid.

306
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,542
Her society is aware

307
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,208
that there is
interstellar life?

308
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,041
No, sir.

309
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:44,125
Oops.

310
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,750
Just where does she think
you're calling from?

311
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:49,041
I've kept that
somewhat vague, sir.

312
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,291
But Sarjenka--
that is her name--

313
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,875
has been quite specific

314
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:56,083
telling me details
of her family and friends.

315
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,000
And interspersed
among these confidences

316
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,917
have been
some alarming references.

317
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,709
Go on.

318
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,959
Drema 4 has been enduring
the same geological stresses

319
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,166
we have found
in the other systems.

320
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,000
Then your friend is in trouble.

321
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,709
Yes, sir.

322
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,417
Well, what are you proposing?

323
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,458
If we can determine
the cause of these
geological disturbances,

324
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,125
we might be able to reverse
the process.

325
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,750
And violate
the prime directive?

326
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:28,792
I was hoping you might have
another option, sir.

327
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,125
We don't even know if this
catastrophe is preventable.

328
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,583
Call a conference
in my quarters.

329
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,834
All senior staff.

330
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,542
Yes, sir.

331
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,208
And Data...

332
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,959
all communication
with this life-form must cease.

333
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,542
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.

334
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,208
(<i> chatter</i> )

335
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,417
RIKER:
...See the look
on his face.

336
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,333
I'll get you another drink.

337
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,625
Two more.

338
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,041
Thank you.

339
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,542
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Family emergency.

340
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,834
Oh.

341
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,959
You don't look like a person
who came here to relax.

342
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,625
I didn't.

343
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,417
I need your advice.

344
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,875
Yesterday,

345
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,917
when Ensign Davies turned in
his geological survey,

346
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,542
I asked him to run
an ico-spectrogram

347
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,333
and he didn't agree.

348
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,750
Do you think you were right?

349
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:48,709
Yes.

350
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,875
I guess...

351
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,250
and I could have just
been picking nits.

352
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,291
Or you could have
been intimidated.

353
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,333
It's tough to tell
other people what to do.

354
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,291
I suppose I could have
made it an order,

355
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,917
but how do you give orders

356
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,375
to someone who is older
and more experienced than you?

357
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:06,750
The difference in ages
between you and Davies

358
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,083
is not the issue here.

359
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,041
I guess not.

360
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,083
Do you think it might have
something to do with ego?

361
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,792
No, it's just
the opposite of ego.

362
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,583
Every time I try to give
an order,

363
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,041
something inside of me says,

364
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,291
what makes my judgment
so superior to these people?

365
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:26,375
Wes, responsibility
and authority go hand in hand.

366
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:28,000
Now I know you're responsible.

367
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,041
Now we've got to teach you
a little bit of authority.

368
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,709
One of the reason
you've been given command

369
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,667
is so you can make
a few right decisions

370
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,500
which will lead
to a pattern of success

371
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,667
and help build self-confidence.

372
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:40,792
If you don't trust
your own judgment,

373
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:43,208
you don't belong
in the command chair.

374
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,542
But what if I'm wrong?

375
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,208
Then you're wrong.

376
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,959
It's arrogant to think that
you'll never make a mistake.

377
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,041
But what if it's something
really important.

378
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,000
I mean, not just
a mineral survey?

379
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,583
What if somebody dies
because I made a mistake?

380
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:01,959
In your position, it's important
to ask yourself one question--

381
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,333
what would Picard do?

382
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,709
He'd listen
to everyone's opinion

383
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,500
and then make his own decision.

384
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:10,959
But he's Captain Picard.

385
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,542
Well, it doesn't matter.

386
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,834
Once Picard makes his decision,
does anyone question it?

387
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,750
No way.
And why not?

388
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:19,083
I'm not sure.

389
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,583
DATA:
Commander Riker,

390
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,000
report
to the Captain's quarters.

391
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,750
When you figure it out,
you'll understand command.

392
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:28,125
I'm on my way.

393
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,458
I hope I've been able to help.

394
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,834
You'll let me know what
you decide?

395
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,875
I've made my decision.

396
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,375
I'm gonna have Davies
run that ico-gram.

397
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:37,083
Thank you, sir.

398
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,083
You're welcome.

399
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,709
(<i> whispers</i> ):
I'll see you later.

400
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,125
Okay.

401
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:49,750
Ensign Davies...

402
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:53,125
I want that ico-spectrogram run
on the Selcundi Drema system.

403
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,709
You got it.

404
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:11,208
PICARD:
It's no longer a matter
of how wrong Data was,

405
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,583
or why he did it.

406
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,542
The dilemma exists.

407
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,250
We have to discuss
the options.

408
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,709
And please,
talk freely.

409
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,375
There are no options.

410
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,500
The prime directive
is not a matter of degrees.

411
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,875
It is an absolute.

412
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:27,250
I have a problem
with that kind of rigidity.

413
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:31,834
It seems callous
and even a little cowardly.

414
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:35,792
Doctor, I'm sure that is not
what the Lieutenant meant.

415
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:38,500
But in situation like this,
we have to be cautious.

416
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:44,709
What we do today may profoundly
affect the future.

417
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:49,000
If we could see
every possible outcome...

418
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,417
RIKER:
We'd be gods,

419
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,166
which we're not.

420
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:56,166
If there is a cosmic plan,
is it not the height of hubris

421
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,709
to think that we can
or should interfere?

422
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,542
So what are you saying, that
the Dremans are fated to die?

423
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,375
I think that's an option that
we should be considering.

424
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,667
Consider it considered and
rejected.

425
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:08,500
If there is a cosmic plan,
are we not a part of it?

426
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:11,041
Our presence at this place,
at this moment in time,

427
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,208
could be a part
of that fate.

428
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,834
Right. And it could be a part
of that plan that we interfere.

429
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,792
Well, that eliminates
the possibility of fate.

430
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,542
DATA:
But Commander,

431
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:24,959
the Dremans are not a subject
for philosophical debate.

432
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,667
They are a people.

433
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:30,834
So we make an exception
in the deaths of millions?

434
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,458
Yes.

435
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,000
And is it the same situation
if it's an epidemic

436
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,875
and not a geological calamity?

437
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,250
Absolutely.

438
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,500
What about a war?

439
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:46,000
If generations of conflict
is killing millions,

440
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:49,417
do we interfere?

441
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,834
Well, now we're all
a little less secure

442
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,250
in our moral certitude.

443
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,375
What if it's not just killings?

444
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:03,583
If an oppressive government
is enslaving millions?

445
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:07,667
See, the prime directive
has many different functions,

446
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:11,500
not the least of which
is to protect us.

447
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:14,583
To prevent us
from allowing our emotions

448
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,875
to overwhelm our judgment.

449
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:19,875
My emotions are involved.

450
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,125
Data's friend
is going to die.

451
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,875
That means something.

452
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,417
To Data.

453
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,834
Does that invalidate
the emotion?

454
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,542
What if the Dremans asked
for our help?

455
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,959
Yes.

456
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,333
Sarjenka's transmission could be
viewed as a call for help.

457
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,208
Sophistry.

458
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,166
PULASKI:
I'll buy that excuse.

459
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,625
We're all jigging madly
on the head of a pin anyway.

460
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:52,208
She cannot ask for help
from someone she does not know.

461
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,834
She knows me.

462
00:24:57,166 --> 00:25:00,125
What a perfectly
vicious little circle.

463
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,208
We are going
to allow her to die,

464
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,583
are we not?

465
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:24,625
Data, I want you to sever
the contact with Drema 4.

466
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,375
COMPUTER:
Isolating frequency.

467
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,750
SARJENKA:
Data? Data? Where are you?

468
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,458
Why won't you answer?

469
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,291
Are you angry with me?

470
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,250
Please, please, I'm so afraid.

471
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,792
Data. Data where are you?

472
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,709
PICARD:
Wait.

473
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,959
Oh, Data.

474
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:10,583
Your whisper from the dark
has now become a plea.

475
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:23,583
We cannot turn our backs.

476
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,125
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42741.3.</i>

477
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,417
<i>We are entering</i>
<i>into orbit of Drema 4,</i>

478
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:38,959
<i>the planet from which Data</i>
<i>received the distress signal.</i>

479
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,375
<i>Sensors indicate that</i>
<i>the volcanic activity</i>
<i>is increasing.</i>

480
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:45,792
We found the reason
for the geological instability.

481
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:46,792
Excellent.

482
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:48,333
We would have
missed it

483
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,542
if Ensign Crusher hadn't
requested an ico-gram.

484
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:51,542
But he did, then...

485
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:55,250
Drema 4 has the largest deposit
of Dilithium ore ever recorded.

486
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,500
It's also laid out
in a very unusual pattern.

487
00:26:57,542 --> 00:27:00,500
The crystals are growing to form
perfectly aligned lattices.

488
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:03,458
The ore is forming
generator strata.

489
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,250
Which creates
a Piezoelectric effect.

490
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,959
In plain English,
you're saying
that the Dilithium

491
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,500
is causing
the geological catastrophe?

492
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:13,792
Right.
The crystals take the natural
radiant heat of a planet...

493
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,125
Focus it and turn it
into mechanical energy...

494
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,959
Which increases
tectonic stresses...

495
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,959
That tear
the planet apart.

496
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,792
And then the crystals
break down

497
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,709
which is why we found
all these traces of Illium-629.

498
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,500
So that takes care
of the why.

499
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:27,917
Now what can you do?

500
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:31,625
That is going to take
a little more work.

501
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:34,333
Can you reverse the process?

502
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,583
We think so.

503
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,834
No. No theories,
no half answers.

504
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:42,917
Yes or no?

505
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:45,375
We'll get to work
on it.

506
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,542
Sir...

507
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,959
Data's out there right now

508
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,208
monitoring the condition
on Drema 4.

509
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,458
The situation has become
pretty desperate for his friend.

510
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,750
He's calculated
the safest location

511
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:05,208
on the planet's surface.

512
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,000
You can guess why.

513
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:15,875
We're just getting deeper
and deeper in, aren't we?

514
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:17,250
She's going to die.

515
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:18,583
They're all going to die.

516
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,750
Unless.
Yes, unless.

517
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:26,917
All right, you can
tell Commander Data

518
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:30,709
he has my permission
to contact his, uh, his friend

519
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,458
and conduct her
to a safer location.

520
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,250
Number One, you know
where we are now?

521
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,041
Sir?

522
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,875
Sarjenka, this is Data.

523
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,250
Please respond.

524
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,917
COMPUTER:
Unable to complete transmission.

525
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,792
Reason for failure?

526
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:03,458
Atmospheric activity
interfering with R.F. signal.

527
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,709
We are modifying
class-one probes

528
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,125
so they become resonators.

529
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,000
We will then use torpedo casings
to protect them

530
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,333
once they begin burrowing
beneath the surface.

531
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:18,792
How will these resonators
destroy the crystals?

532
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:22,542
By emitting harmonic vibrations
which will shatter the lattices.

533
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,125
The<i> Enterprise</i> will monitor

534
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,083
and adjust the frequency
of the resonators.

535
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,709
Sounds like a plan.
Let's get started.

536
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:37,375
Captain...

537
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:39,625
Tea, Earl Grey, hot.

538
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:45,458
Captain, permission
to beam down to Drema 4.

539
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,834
What?

540
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:49,625
I have been unable
to contact Sarjenka.

541
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,959
Data, I appreciate
your concern.

542
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,542
Transporting to the surface

543
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:01,417
is only going to make
a bad situation worse.

544
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:04,417
Sir, I feel it is important
to determine the reason for...

545
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,166
Come on, Data.

546
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,834
Captain, your orders were
to deliver the message, correct?

547
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,125
Yes.

548
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,792
Then what is the difference

549
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:16,208
between sending the message
and delivering it personally?

550
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,667
A whopping big one
and you know it.

551
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:20,834
Sir, we have come this far.

552
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,125
In for a penny,
in for a pound.

553
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,041
Is that what you're saying,
Mr. Data?

554
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:28,333
Yes, sir.

555
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,667
Oh, hell.

556
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,500
Go.

557
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,417
Sir?

558
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:39,583
Number One, handle
the transporter.

559
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:40,834
Go.

560
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:46,041
Where would you say
we are now, sir?

561
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,750
O'Brien, take a nap.

562
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,125
You didn't see any of this,
you're not involved.

563
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,500
Right, sir.

564
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:04,959
I'll just be standing
over here dozing off.

565
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,083
Data, you've got
ten minutes, that's it.

566
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,667
If you see anybody
but Sarjenka...

567
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,792
I will signal
for immediate beam out.

568
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,667
PICARD:
Commander Riker to the Bridge.

569
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:20,834
Damn.

570
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,125
I just woke up, sir.

571
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,208
You know what to do?

572
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,500
No problem, sir.

573
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,125
I'll have him out of there
as smooth as ice.

574
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:54,083
(<i> high-pitched beeping</i> )

575
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:03,250
(<i> beeping lowers in pitch)</i>

576
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,917
Sarjenka?

577
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:51,375
Wait, I am Data.

578
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,875
Data.

579
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:59,000
Data, you came.

580
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,000
Data, where have you been?

581
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:08,750
It would take too long
to explain.

582
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:10,542
You and your family must leave.

583
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:12,375
We already have.

584
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:14,667
We ran when
the tremors began.

585
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:16,041
Then why are you here?

586
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:20,375
My father wouldn't
let us take anything,

587
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,834
but I had to have
my transmitter.

588
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,750
I knew you would come back

589
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:27,834
and I didn't want you
to find only silence,

590
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,625
the way I did.

591
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:33,959
I am sorry for that,
but it is very complicated.

592
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,166
Does your family know
where you are?

593
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:37,583
No.

594
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,709
You cannot survive in this.

595
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:47,000
What are we going to do?

596
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:58,792
<i>Enterprise,</i>
two to beam up.

597
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:00,875
You must come with me.

598
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:02,458
Where are we going?

599
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,291
To the stars?

600
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:32,834
There's going to be hell to pay.

601
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,583
Where is Commander Riker?

602
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,125
On the Bridge.

603
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:40,709
Where are you going?

604
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,458
To the Bridge.

605
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,417
And you are going to take<i> that?</i>

606
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:48,500
Don't leave me here.
Please don't leave me here.

607
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:50,250
Quite impossible.

608
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:17,333
Sir, three minutes
to resonator launch.

609
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:21,959
Where is he?

610
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,250
He'll be here.

611
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:32,917
He has brought
a child onto my ship

612
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,583
and on my bridge.

613
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:37,291
I'm sure Mr. Data has
a very good explanation.

614
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,041
I do, sir.

615
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,417
She was frightened

616
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:41,667
and did not wish
to be left...

617
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:45,875
Mr. Data, kindly
assume your station.

618
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:48,333
Counselor, will you
escort her to Sick Bay?

619
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:52,834
No, Data.

620
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,709
No, I'm scared.
Don't make me go.

621
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,417
It's all right.
No one's going to hurt you.

622
00:35:58,458 --> 00:35:59,667
No.

623
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:03,959
TROI:
We'll just go and get
a treat and then...

624
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,542
No.

625
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,875
Captain, I will see to it
that she is not in the way.

626
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:10,041
One minute to launch.

627
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,667
Come on,
it'll be all right.

628
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:12,959
No.

629
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,166
Just leave me alone.

630
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,125
I want Data.

631
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:20,542
Counselor, allow me.
Please.

632
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:23,375
Sarjenka, no one will harm you.

633
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:24,875
These are my friends.

634
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,792
PICARD:
Mr. Data.

635
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,750
Take your station.
Keep her with you.

636
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:32,875
This does concern her.

637
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,375
Ten seconds.

638
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,750
I will require my hand.

639
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,500
Thank you.

640
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,083
Firing torpedoes.

641
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:59,250
Sensors locked on probes.

642
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,166
WORF:
Torpedoes have reached
their targets.

643
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,959
Resonators activated.

644
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,291
Harmonic sequences
have begun.

645
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:09,834
What are you doing?

646
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,625
We are attempting
to quiet your planet.

647
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,208
If we succeed,

648
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,959
there will be no more
quakes, no more volcanoes.

649
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,083
Ensign, when should the results
be known?

650
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,083
This should happen
very quickly, sir.

651
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,959
And my parents and brothers?

652
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,917
Captain, sensors indicate

653
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:32,792
a planet-wide reduction
in tectonic stress levels.

654
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,166
It worked.

655
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,750
We did it.

656
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,166
Your parents will be safe now.

657
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:49,542
You did this for me?

658
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,417
Look, Sarjenka.

659
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:56,625
There is your home.

660
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,041
Data...

661
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:09,709
Escort her to Sick Bay.

662
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,208
Aye, sir.

663
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,709
Number One,
you have the Bridge.

664
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,333
Doctor.

665
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,709
Yes, Captain.

666
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,417
Data and the alien
are on their way down.

667
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:30,083
What would be involved
in removing

668
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:33,291
all memory of her communication
with Data

669
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,333
and her visit to this ship?

670
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:40,458
Assuming that her brain
structure is similar to ours,

671
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,500
the memories would be stored
chemically

672
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:46,000
on the neurons
of the cerebral cortex.

673
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,625
They are also time dependent.

674
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:52,834
I would have to scan for the age
of the chemical links

675
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,875
and try to find
the relevant neurons.

676
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:58,000
Well, do your best.

677
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,500
You have many different
kinds of people here.

678
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:03,875
Yes.

679
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:05,959
When I'm bigger,
can I be on your ship?

680
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,125
I am certain that
you could.

681
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:10,125
I wish I could
come with you now.

682
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:12,583
I am afraid that
is not possible.

683
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:15,750
I know, but I can
still wish for it.

684
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:21,375
Dr. Pulaski...

685
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:23,041
this is Sarjenka.

686
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,834
Hello, Sarjenka.

687
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,166
Hello.

688

(<i> stone sings</i> )

689
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,083
What is this?

690
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:35,917
That's an Elanin singer stone.

691
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,959
It sings
a different song

692
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,291
for each person.

693
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,625
What does it
sing for you?

694
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,500
It does not sing for me.

695
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,000
Why not?

696
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:49,000
Because I am a machine.

697
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,792
Sarjenka...

698
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:53,000
we're going to run
a few scans

699
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,959
just to be sure
you're all right.

700
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,250
Data will be right here.

701
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,959
Don't worry.

702
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:47,333
You did a good thing, Data.

703
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:50,250
But are we doing
a good thing now, Doctor?

704
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,792
This is to protect her
as much as us.

705
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,917
By robbing her of her memories?

706
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:59,458
To remember you and this ship
would complicate her future.

707
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,542
She has to be the person
she was born to be.

708
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,458
And you'll remember.

709
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,709
(<i> stone sings</i> )

710
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,333

711
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:43,041

712
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:47,500
Sit down.

713
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:49,291
No, thank you, sir.

714
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,792
It's going to be a long time

715
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,583
before I'm qualified enough
to sit there.

716
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,834
You did a good job.
I'm proud of you.

717
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,834
Thank you, sir.

718
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,959
Does it get any easier?

719
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,959
Nope.

720
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,208
(<i> door chimes</i> )

721
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,709
Come.

722
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:16,583
I came to apologize, sir.

723
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,583
No apologies are
necessary.

724
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:29,750
You reminded us
that there are obligations

725
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:31,291
that go beyond duty.

726
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:34,834
I appreciate your seeking
other options, sir.

727
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:37,083
Your decision could have
been unilateral.

728
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:40,333
One of my officers,
one of my friends was troubled.

729
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:42,166
I had to help.

730
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,083
Is Sarjenka safely home?

731
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,583
Yes, sir.

732
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,250
She will not
remember me, sir.

733
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,291
But I will remember her.

734
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,000
Remembrance and regrets,

735
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:00,667
they, too, are part
of friendship.

736
00:44:00,709 --> 00:44:01,959
Yes, sir.

737
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,583
And understanding that

738
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:10,208
has brought you a step closer
to understanding humanity.
