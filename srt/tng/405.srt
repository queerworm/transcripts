It's kind of your captain
to ferry me home.

It was on our way.

My pleasure, Doctor.

Dalen, I was sorry
to hear about Patricia.

17
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,834
She had been ill
for some time.

18
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,417
Is her death the reason

19
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,959
you're giving up
your post here?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,083
Well, we had a
lifetime together

21
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,375

we'd ever dreamed

I couldn't continue

sleep in that bed
without her.

26
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:11,917
The absence of her
was too distracting.

27
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,959

making any sense.

didn't take the time

37
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:36,417
to appreciate them
while you still could.

38
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:37,625
Oh, I'm sorry.

Lieutenant Worf,
yesterday, before
we left starbase

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,041
an old friend of
mine came onboard,
Dr. Dalen Quaice.

90
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,750
I requested
quarters for him.

91
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,291
He was assigned here.

92
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,750
I was not aware
of this passenger.

93
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,583
I'm sorry.
I thought it was
standard procedure

94
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,792
for you to be informed

95
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,750
after Captain Picard
approved passage.

96
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:56,125
It is.
Please proceed.

97
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,458
We were to meet
for breakfast,

98
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500

Lieutenant, Dr. Quaice

102
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,625
is very old
and rather frail.

If he fell somewhere

104
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,959
if his communicator
were damaged...

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,417
I will order a search
immediately.

had been injured

108
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,375
why would his belongings
be missing?

WORF:
Sir, I have
several teams

110
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,500
conducting
a deck-by-deck search.

00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:36,959
It is not yet complete.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,667
I have scanned
the entire ship, Captain.

113
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,709
Other than the<i> Enterprise's</i>
regular complement

114
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,917
I could find
no one else onboard.

115
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,667
Your sensors
wouldn't detect him

116
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:47,125
if he were dead.

117
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,709
That is correct,
Doctor.

118
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,959
Could, um...

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,500
your friend have returned
to the starbase

120
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:54,375
without telling you--
an emergency of some sort?

121
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,583
There were a lot
of people going
back and forth

122
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,583
between the ship
and the starbase
yesterday.

123
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,792
We could easily check
the transporter ID traces.

124
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:04,250
By all means,
check the trace log,

125
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,792
but even if the results
are negative

126
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,625
contact Starbase Command.

127
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:08,917
We should leave nothing
to chance.

128
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,291

130
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:22,834
I'm sure you're aware
of the procedure

131
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,166

132
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,959
Of course.
I don't know why

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,333
Lieutenant Worf wasn't
told about Dr. Quaice.

134
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,875
Well, I was not
informed either.

135
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,583
But I sent in a request
weeks ago.

136
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:36,083
Then it must have
been intercepted

137
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,542
before it reached me.

138
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,333

sent approval?

139
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,667
Why?

140
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,250
Dr. Quaice had
been stationed

141
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,750
at the starbase
for some time?

142
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,709
Six years.

143
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,417
Perhaps it would be
prudent to find out

144
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,667
if he had acquired
any enemies there.

I've known him for 15 years.

159
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,000
I do not doubt you, Doctor
but I have tried

160
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,041
173 phonetic variations
of the name, and I...

161
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,834

00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,583
That was my watch.

181
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,959
<i>I</i> beamed this man onboard?

182
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,750
Yes.
I was here to meet him.

183
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:12,333
An elderly man,
not in the best of health.

184
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,792
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:16,125
I remember<i> you</i> being here
for a short while

186
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,542
but you were alone.

187
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,125
W-Was he invisible?

188
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,083
Did I carry on
a conversation with thin air?

189
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,959
No, Doctor.

190
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,208
As I recall, you came in

191
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,792
and you looked around
for a few moments.

192
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:31,792
I asked you if I could
help you with anything.

193
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,375
All you said was "thank you."

194
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,500
I said, "my pleasure"
or something.

195
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,250
And that was the end of it.

196
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,208
There was
no one else here.

197
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,500
I can't believe

198
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,917
that Chief O'Brien
might be lying.

199
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,500
Well, he believes
what he says.

200
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,709
And there is no trace
imprint for Dr. Quaice.

201
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,542
Will, I didn't
just conjure up

202
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,333
one of my best friends
from a test tube.

203
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,625
Well, if the ship's records
have been tampered with

204
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:04,875
the transporter records

205
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:06,333
could have been
changed, as well.

206
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,208
And with everybody coming
and going yesterday

207
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,250
maybe O'Brien just
doesn't remember.

208
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,875
Or...
Or?

209
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,000
It might be a good
idea to run

210
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,375
a diagnostic on him.

211
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,875
To make sure<i> he</i> wasn't
tampered with.

212
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:18,917
What do you think?

213
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,750
It's worth a try.

214
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,208
I'll check the replicator
activity logs.

215
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,959
18 hours is a long time
to go without food.

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,709
Or without
someone seeing him.

217
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

218
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,208
Chief, this examination

219
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,250
should only take
a few minutes.

220
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,458
But I feel fine.

221
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,834
Sit down.

222
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:46,667
Doctor, it's no use
checking my eyesight.

223
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:48,291
I didn't see your friend.

224
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,959
I'll be a little
more comprehensive
than that, Chief.

225
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,500
Dr. Crusher to Dr. Hill.

226
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,500
Respond, please.

227
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:04,583
Dr. Selar,
your present location?

228
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:11,417
Computer, current whereabouts
of Doctors Hill and Selar.

229
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,500
There is no Dr. Hill
or Dr. Selar

230
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,125
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

231
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:22,375
Doctors Hill and Selar
and four other members

232
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,750
of my medical staff
have all vanished.

233
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:27,125
All record of their ever having
been on the<i> Enterprise</i>

234
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,583
has been excised
from the computer's memory.

235
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,166
Did they come onboard
with Dr. Quaice?

236
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,083
No, they've been onboard
for months,

237
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,500
but my two duty nurses
don't remember them.

238
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,750
Their families
don't even remember them.

239
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,291
As O'Brien didn't
remember Dr. Quaice.

240
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,166
I checked
O'Brien thoroughly.

241
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,000
I found no physiological
abnormalities.

242
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,291
WESLEY:
Crusher to Captain Picard.

243
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,542
Go ahead, Ensign.

244
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,125
I'm in engineering, sir.

245
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,166
There's something down here
I think you'd better see.

246
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,583
It may be connected to
Dr. Quaice's disappearance.

247
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,000
On my way.

248
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,625
Progress, number one.

249
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,000
No one's seen him.

250
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,250
The replicator in his quarters
has not been used.

251
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,083
Mr. Worf, check hull
and shield integrity

252
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,291
for any sign
of intruders.

253
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,041
Yes, sir.
But I have been

254
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,333
closely monitoring
all onboard sensors.

255
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,625
There has been
no indication
that anything...

256
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,208
Then give me a
level-1 diagnostic

257
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,166
of any onboard sensors,
and run a manual sweep

258
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,291
of any anomalous airborne
or electromagnetic readings.

259
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,875
I want some answers.

260
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:27,750
I've been
experimenting

261
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,542
with Kosinski's
warp field equations

262
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,041
trying to improve
engine efficiency.

263
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,709
I've read your reports.

264
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,333
We did a test run
while we were still
at the starbase.

265
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,125
Here's what
the computer recorded.

266
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,333
WESLEY:
This is the static warp field

267
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,208
we created
inside the warp drive.

268
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,834
The experiment was
designed to see

269
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,625
if we could keep a
bubble like this intact.

270
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,667
As you'll see in a moment,
we couldn't.

271
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:51,583
There was a momentary
flash of light.

272
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,291
It was all over the spectrum.

273
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,375
I remember that.

274
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,542
Are you suggesting
that a<i> bubble</i>

275
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,417
could have made
Dr. Quaice disappear?

276
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,917
If he were caught
in it, yes, sir.

277
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,083
It would seem to us
like he'd disappeared.

278
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,041
Where would he go?
LA FORGE:
Who knows?

279
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,500
Could even end up outside
of our space-time continuum.

280
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,458
Was Dr. Quaice in engineering
during your experiment?

281
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,917
LA FORGE:
No, sir.

282
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,041
And the bubble never expanded
beyond engineering?

283
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,417
No, sir.

284
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,583
Then how could it
have trapped Dr. Quaice

285
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,667
or the others?

286
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,208
There are others missing?

287
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,166
Yes, and they
weren't anywhere
near engineering.

288
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,417
It doesn't make sense.

289
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,750
I doubt that a warp bubble

290
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:32,417
could alter computer records
or erase memories.

291
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,083
Keep at it, Ensign,
Mr. La Forge.

292
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,291
It's our only
working theory for now.

293
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,083
Has something
else happened?

294
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,500
Sick bay is
totally empty.

295
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,792
Apparently, I no longer
have<i> any</i> staff.

296
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,417
And that surprises
you, Doctor?

297
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,542
(<i> scoffs</i> )
Surprises me?

298
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,792
I'll say it surprises me.

299
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,083
There should be
at least four members

300
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,875
of my staff on duty
at all times.

301
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,208
DATA:
I am afraid ship's records

302
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,667
do not concur, Doctor.

303
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,166
What are you talking about?

304
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,417
You do not have a staff.

305
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,083
You're telling me,
I'm the sole medical officer

306
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,291
on a ship with over
1,000 people onboard?

307
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,709
DATA:
Excuse me, Doctor

308
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,458
but the entire ship's
complement is 230.

309
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,291
What?

310
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,792
Doctor, may I see you
in my ready room?

311
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,500
Would you care
for something?

312
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,166
So, Beverly...

313
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,500
Tea, Earl Grey. Hot.

314
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,750
You're saying that
this ship has lost

315
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:19,375
nearly 800 of
its personnel.

316
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:21,667
I know how it sounds.

317
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:24,959
None of the scans
show any anomalies.

318
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,959
No signs of
an intruder.

319
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,542
Wesley's experiment clearly
did not have the scope

320
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,667
to affect an entire starship.

321
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,917
Captain, the<i> Enterprise</i>
is in serious danger.

322
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,166
You<i> must</i> believe me.

323
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,667
I have no choice
but to believe you.

324
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,709
The safety of my entire crew
is at stake.

325
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,291
But I... I must be sure.

326
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,500
That I haven't lost my mind?

327
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,500
I just examined myself

328
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:53,917
and being the only
doctor onboard

329
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,583
I had to do it myself.

330
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,583
There were no signs
of dysfunction.

331
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,875
Yes, there was

332
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,709
an increased elevation
of adrenaline

333
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,417
but I think
that is understandable.

334
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,083
Did you find anything
that might suggest

335
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,750
why<i> you're</i> apparently
the only one among us

336
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,583
unaffected by this...
this phenomenon?

337
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,667
No.

338
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,625
I'll talk to Troi.

339
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:22,250
It wouldn't do any harm.

340
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,709
Captain, please.

341
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,208
Return this ship to Starbase 133
for a full diagnostic.

342
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,709
I realize you have my word
only to convince you.

343
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,291
Mr. Riker?

344
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,834
Captain?

345
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,792
Set a course for a return
to Starbase 133 immediately.

346
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,291
Aye, sir.

347
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,917
Your word has always
been good enough for me.

348
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,917
(<i> electromagnetic whooshing</i> )

349
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,083
(<i> yelling</i> )

350
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,709
(<i> whooshing stops</i> )

351
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,000
I've had a team in
sick bay for two hours.

352
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,375
We've run the
mass spectrometer
on all particulates.

353
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,458
We've scanned
the EM spectrum

354
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,750
in case there was

355
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,500
a wave guide
somehow leaking radiation.

356
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,250
We've even crawled around
in the life-support ductwork.

357
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,500
Captain, I don't know
what this vortex was

358
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:56,959
that Doctor Crusher saw.

359
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,041
I didn't just see it, I felt it.

360
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,375
I barely escaped from it.

361
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,542
Well, there's
nothing there now

362
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,917
<i>and</i> no sign there ever was.

363
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:08,000
Is there any
possible connection

364
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,250
with Mr. Crusher's experiment?

365
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,667
Could this "warp bubble"

366
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:16,667
be floating
about the ship perhaps?

367
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:18,750
No, sir, that bubble was
definitely

368
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:19,917
contained in engineering.

369
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,250
There's no way
it could possibly

370
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,750
have affected anything
up on deck 12.

371
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,959
Sir, I have completed level-1
computer diagnostics.

372
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,542
There are no malfunctions.

373
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,667
Have any other ships responded
to our queries, Data?

374
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:34,166
The<i> Wellington</i> is the only

375
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,000
Federation vessel
in this sector.

376
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,959
It reports normal operations.

377
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,542
A Ferengi ship
within communications range

378
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,417
also reports nothing unusual.

379
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,917
Are all the members of the crew
accounted for?

380
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,083
Yes, Doctor.

381
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,792
How many are there?

382
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,709
There are 114 people
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

383
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,000
(<i> quietly</i> ):
What?

384
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,417
That is the exact number
there should be.

385
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,959
There are now over 900 missing.

386
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:03,709
Deck after deck

387
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,583
of this ship is deserted now.

388
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,500
How do you account
for all the empty rooms?

389
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:10,208
If there are only supposed
to be 114 people onboard

390
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,834
why all the extra space?

391
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,792
Transportation of colonists

392
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,917
diplomatic missions,
emergency evacuations...

393
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,583
Thank you, Mr. Data.

394
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,041
Have security confine

395
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,542
all non-essential personnel
to their quarters.

396
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,208
Computer, go
to red alert.

397
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,750
I'd like Lieutenant Worf
to program onboard sensors

398
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,208
to monitor
all personnel.

399
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,542
If we can catch
the moment...

400
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,959
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,166
Whom did you say?

402
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,000
Worf. Chief of security.

403
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,500
The big guy who never smiles?

404
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,083
The Klingon!

405
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,542
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Whoa.

406
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,792
Deanna?

407
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,875
I need you to tell
me if I've gone
completely mad.

408
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,917
If you can ask the question,
I'd say no.

409
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,333
Don't evade
the question.

410
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,792
Well, then, ask me one
I can answer.

411
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:16,583
Deanna, I've delivered
babies that no longer exist.

412
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,250
No one else
remembers them.

413
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,417
Yet I can close
my eyes and see
their faces

414
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,083
clearly as I
see yours now.

415
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,083
What if it's not
some huge conspiracy?

416
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,542
What if it is just me?

417
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,709
What if it<i> is</i> just you?

418
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,375
Then I've delayed
a mission

419
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:33,208
and frightened
a lot of people,
including myself.

420
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,792
So what?

421
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,125
You have acted
in the best interests

422
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,834
of your ship and crew.

423
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,083
What more could you ask
of yourself?

424
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,125
And if this turns out
to be a mistake

425
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:47,208
then we'll be a little
late arriving at Durenia IV.

426
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,417
That's all.

427
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,417
It's not a mistake.

428
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,834
I wish it were.

429
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,000
When we reach
starbase

430
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,375
I'll order
a complete workup

431
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:56,166
both physical and psychological.

432
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,333
<i>If</i> we reach starbase.

433
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,125
Wesley.

434
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,875
Where's Wesley?

435
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,458
Wesley!

436
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,625
Mom?

437
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,041
Are you all right?

438
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,250
No.

439
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,500
We may have very
little time left.

440
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:35,083
You don't believe me.

441
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,291
Look, mom, I don't know...

442
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,583
I don't have time
to convince you.

443
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,417
Hundreds of people
are now missing

444
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,458
and your experiment is the only
possible explanation we have

445
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,834
that we can work
on right now.

446
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,250
Well, there it is.

447
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,417
I don't know what else
to do with it.

448
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,083
Then find someone who does.

449
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,083
Someone who knows something
about... about warp bubbles.

450
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,250
I've already talked
to Kosinski on subspace

451
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,792
and he can't explain it, either.

452
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:57,041
And this is based
on his equations.

453
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,208
There is someone
who may be able to help

454
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,417
but I can't reach him.

455
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,417
Who?

456
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,667
He was
Kosinski's assistant.

457
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:04,750
He was an alien
from Tau Alpha C.

458
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,959
He said he was
some kind of "traveler."

459
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,041
somehow, he combined
warp technology

460
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,166
and the energy
from his own thoughts.

461
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:14,625
Yes, I remember.

462
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,709
Wesley, do you think
it's possible

463
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,667
that you've
accidentally recreated

464
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,000
something that he did?

465
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,625
Something
that could alter reality?

466
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,458
I don't see how.

467
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,625
He's the only one
who could explain it to us.

468
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,291
I've sent a message
to Tau Alpha C

469
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,125
but it's so far away,
it could take days to get there.

470
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,375
Maybe the captain
can help us.

471
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:36,500
We've got to find him.
Come on.

472
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:37,625
I don't even know
if he's still alive.

473
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,041
He was very sick.

474
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,166
Well, we can't stand
around here doing nothing.

475
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,166
It's a chance.

476
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,959
We have to try to...

477
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,834
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Wesley.

478
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:53,208
Wesley!

479
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,959
They're all gone?

480
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:36,542
Riker, Troi, Data?

481
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,166
Wait a minute.
Let me guess.

482
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,917
You never heard
of any of them.

483
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:43,375
You know, Doctor,
I have been more than fair.

484
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:47,000
I've done everything I can
to substantiate your...

485
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,166
... your perceptions
of a crew...

486
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,333
Will Riker.

487
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,125
Your first officer.

488
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:54,375
He's-he's very good

489
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,417
at playing poker,
loves to cook.

490
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:59,792
He listens to jazz music,
plays the trombone.

491
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:02,208
I cannot find
any evidence of a Will Riker...

492
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,542
Commander Data,
the android who sits at ops.

493
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,083
Dreams of being human.

494
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,000
Never gets the punch line
of a joke.

495
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:13,041
Doctor... we'll be arriving
at Starbase 133 in a few hours.

496
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,250
Deanna Troi,
your ship's counselor.

497
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:16,792
Half-Betazoid, loves chocolate.

498
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:19,917
The arrival of her mother
makes you shudder.

499
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:22,583
O'Brien, Geordi, Worf.

500
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,083
Wesley, my son.

501
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,750
They all have been
the living,

502
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,375
breathing heart of this crew
for over three years.

503
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:31,458
They deserve more
than to be shrugged off,

504
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,000
brushed aside

505
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:37,000
just pinched
out of existence like that.

506
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,000
They all do.

507
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,000
They deserve
so much more.

508
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,291
Beverly...

509
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,250
perhaps it would be best
if you were to confine yourself

510
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,750
to sick bay
until we arrive.

511
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:01,083
(<i> laughing</i> )

512
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:05,041
It's all perfectly logical
to you, isn't it?

513
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,375
The two of us

514
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:10,750
roaming about the galaxy

515
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:12,333
in the flagship
of the Federation.

516
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,667
No crew at all.

517
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,625
We've never needed
a crew before.

518
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:22,959
I don't suppose you remember
an alien from Tau Alpha C

519
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,500
who was onboard once?

520
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:27,000
He called himself a "traveler."

521
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,125
Jean-Luc

522
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,041
I don't know how,
but you and I

523
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:33,500
have got to find this traveler,
or another from his race.

524
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,125
If anyone
can help us...

525
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,583
I give you my word,
when we arrive at the starbase

526
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:41,166
I will make every effort
to find him.

527
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,709
It's not a delusion.

528
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,667
It is not a dream.

529
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:50,000
There is a physical,
measurable phenomenon

530
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,125
at work here.

531
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:56,667
Perhaps you could help me
to identify it.

532
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:58,709
How?

533
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,125
I'd like to use

your life functions.

535
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:04,208
Until I disappear?

536
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,667
It will happen.

537
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:13,500
All right.

538
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:15,250
Computer,

539
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,959
Captain Jean-Luc

Begin now.

Body temperature,

542
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,500
I promise you,
I will continue to do

543
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,291
whatever I can
to find out what's happening

544
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,625
and to bring you all back.

545
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,917
Blood pressure, 122 over 76.

546
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,500
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

547
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:32,250
You do remember that?

548
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:33,250
Vividly.

549
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:35,125
Electrolytic balance...

550
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:37,792
But if I have forgotten
my closest friends and comrades

551
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:41,583
as you say,
then I deserved every word.

552
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:43,375
Respiration, 17.
Blood pressure...

553
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:46,625
For quite some time, I've been
meaning to say something to you.

554
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,375
I might not have
another chance.

555
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:51,500
Jean-Luc, you and I...

556
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:52,959
(<i> computer readout stops</i> )

557
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,875
I won't forget.

558
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:08,458
I won't forget any of you.

559
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:24,667

<i>Wesley, have you got it?</i>

564
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,208
<i>What's happening?</i>

565
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,000
<i>I'm losing it.</i>

566
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:09,083
The link
isn't holding, Commander.

567
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,750
I'll go
to the secondary equations.

568
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:17,667
No.

569
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:19,083
Look.

570
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:22,333
I've lost it.

571
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:27,375
Damn, I'm sorry, Wesley.

572
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:31,041
It's over.

573
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,875
There's no way
we'll get her back now.

574
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:35,792
TRAVELER:
<i>It's not over, Wesley.</i>

575
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:41,458
There's still a way.

576
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:50,291
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44162.5.</i>

577
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:53,208
<i>Two attempts to retrieve</i>
<i>Dr. Crusher have failed.</i>

578
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,750
<i>And now the Traveler--</i>

579
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:59,667
<i>a mysterious visitor</i>
<i>from our past-- has reappeared.</i>

580
00:29:59,709 --> 00:30:01,208
Is she alive?

581
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,208
As long as she
thinks she is alive

582
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,083
she is alive.

583
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:08,709
What the hell does that mean?

584
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,625
Your species have
very narrow perceptions

585
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:16,000
of time and space and thought.

586
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:17,917
When Beverly Crusher was caught

587
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:20,000
in the static
warp bubble

588
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:23,083
she created her own reality.

589
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:26,667
Her thoughts at the precise
moment she was trapped

590
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:29,375
determined its shape and form.

591
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:31,417
Can you go in and get her back?

592
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:34,458
No, it is<i> her</i> reality.

593
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,792
I cannot enter it

594
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,709
anymore than I can enter
her thoughts.

595
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,125
But you said
there's still a way.

596
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,041
I can help

597
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:47,834
but I can't do it myself.

598
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,125
Wesley...

599
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:52,250
there is a power
within each of us

600
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:55,208
that most people
haven't begun to realize.

601
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,083
But you have begun

602
00:30:57,125 --> 00:31:00,250
or else I would not have
known to come here now.

603
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,625
Together, we may be able
to open a gateway for her...

604
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:08,417
but she must choose
to walk through it.

605
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,041
Computer, we are
going to apply

606
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,000
precise diagnostic methodology.

607
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,458
Once we've cataloged
the symptoms

608
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,792
we will proceed
to determine the illness

609
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:24,417
and then find the cure.

610
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,125
We will start
with the assumption

611
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:29,083
that I am<i> not</i> crazy.

612
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,333
If I am, it won't matter
one way or another.

613
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:35,208
Computer, read the entire
crew roster for the<i> Enterprise.</i>

614
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,250
Dr. Beverly Crusher.

615
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:39,834
Have I always been
the only member of the crew

616
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,625
on the starship<i> Enterprise?</i>

617
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,500
Affirmative.

618
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,458
If this were a bad dream,
would you tell me?

619
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,709
(<i> strained beeping</i> )

620
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,000
That is not a valid question.

621
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,041
Like hell, it's not.

622
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:55,125
What date did I report onboard?

623
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,333
Stardate 41154,

624
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:00,834
1400 hours, three minutes.

625
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,625
That sounds about right.

626
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:06,208
Computer, is there more
than one USS<i> Enterprise?</i>

627
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,417
This vessel
is the fifth starship

628
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:11,208
to bear the name USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

629
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,166
It is currently the only one
in service.

630
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:17,875
What is the primary mission
of the starship<i> Enterprise?</i>

631
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:20,333
To explore the galaxy.

632
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:23,625
Do I have the necessary skills
to complete that mission alone?

633
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:24,917
Negative.

634
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:27,166
Then why am I
the only crew member?

635
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:28,875
(<i> strained beeping</i> )

636
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:31,041
Aha, gotcha there.

637
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:34,083
That information
is not available.

638
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,750
Computer, are you familiar

639
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,542
with the inhabitants
of Tau Alpha C?

640
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,125
Affirmative.

641
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:48,250
Are any presently located
on any starbase or vessel

642
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,250
within communication distance?

643
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:52,458
Negative.

644
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,125
Estimated time to Tau Alpha C
at warp 9.5?

645
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:58,500
123 days.

646
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:03,834

648
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,208
for Tau Alpha C

649
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,583
and send a subspace message
advising them of our arrival.

650
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,166
Acknowledged.

651
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,959
Engage.

(<i> computer silence</i> )

653
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,250
Computer, did you change course?

654
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,208
State new destination
or coordinates.

655
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,250
I stated it.
Damn it.

656
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:29,625
Tau Alpha C.

657
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:33,166
There is no Tau Alpha C
listed on current star maps.

<i>and the precise position where</i>
<i>the subspace bubble was formed.</i>

662
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:58,041
Our goal will

663
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,041
between our reality and
your mother's reality.

664
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,750
We've tried.
We can't stabilize the link.

665
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,458
Of course not.

666
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,208
The equations are
only the first step.

667
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,834
We will be going
beyond mathematics.

668
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,625
Just tell me
what I have to do.

669
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,125
Begin by letting go
of your guilt, Wesley.

670
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,834
It's<i> my</i> fault.
I shouldn't
have tried...

671
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,291
Focus on the present.

672
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,417
You will have
to be here completely

673
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,625
to help her back.

674
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:30,583
You must open yourself
to time and space

675
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:33,458
and the intricate threads
that bind them.

676
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:38,041
Begin entering
your warp field equations.

677
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,166
Now close your eyes.

I can't do it.

683
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:09,250
When the time comes,
you will, Wesley.

684
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,917
You will.

685
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:14,458

Computer, what is that mist
I'm seeing?

692
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:38,458
Sensors indicate it
to be a mass-energy field

693
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,250
705 meters in diameter.

694
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:43,834
It surrounds the ship?

695
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,208
Affirmative.

696
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:51,000
If there's nothing
wrong with<i> me...</i>

697
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,041
maybe there's something wrong
with the universe.

698
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:02,500
Computer, what is beyond
the mass-energy field?

699
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:05,417
Sensors cannot penetrate
the field.

700
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,792
Here's a question
you shouldn't be able to answer.

701
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:17,583
Computer, what is the nature
of the universe?

702
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:20,083
The universe is
a spheroid region

703
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,792
705 meters in diameter.

704
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:44,709
Captain, approaching
Starbase 133.

705
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,458
Slow to ten meters

00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:58,750
There it is.

There's your warp bubble,
Wesley.

713
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,250
What?

714
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,625
What's wrong?

715
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:24,125
It is... collapsing.

716
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,542
Computer, give me

717
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:44,500
a graphic representation
of the universe.

718
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,458
I've seen this before.

719
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,125
Wesley's experiment.

720
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,125
The bubble.

721
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,291
Of course.

722
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,792
But that would mean

723
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:06,375
that<i> I'm the one trapped</i>
<i>in the bubble.</i>

724
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,458
(<i> rumbling</i> )

725
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,834
Computer, what's happening?

726
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:11,875
Explosive decompression,
decks 5 through 14.

727
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,625
Sealing off forward sections.

728
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,625
Cause?

729
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,250
A flaw in the ship's design.

730
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:17,583
Show me.

731
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,208
Analysis.

732
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,959
No ship's structures exist
forward of bulkhead 342.

733
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:27,125
Superimpose previous image
over this one

734
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:29,834
same scale,
and continue to monitor.

735
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,000
(<i> rumbling</i> )

736
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,834
It's collapsing!

737
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,709
Hull integrity
now compromised

738
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,208
on decks three through 15.

739
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,125
Computer,

740
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:43,875
how long can life-support
be maintained?

741
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:46,000
Four minutes, 17 seconds.

742
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,166
(<i> rumbling</i> )

743
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,417
Captain, we have
reestablished

744
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:54,750
exact coordinates
and attitude.

745
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,625
Geordi, we're in position.
Your status?

746
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,208
LA FORGE:
The warp bubble is contracting

747
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,375
at a rate of 15 meters
per second.

748
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:02,959
We're going to lose it
in about four minutes.

749
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,959
It is time,
Wesley.

750
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:09,542
(<i> beeping</i> )

751
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:12,750
We're ready, Commander.

752
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:13,792
RIKER:
Proceed.

753
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,917
I'll be in engineering.

754
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,625
Let it go, Wesley.

755
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:27,333
Let go
of the anticipation

756
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:29,959
the expectations

757
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,417
the demands
upon yourself.

758
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:34,500
Let it all go.

759
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,792
Leave it behind.

760
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:40,750
Yes.

761
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,959
The ability is there
inside of you.

762
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,583
You do not need
to look for it.

763
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:53,834
Three minutes, 30 seconds
to life-support failure.

764
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:57,959
The Traveler used his thoughts
to alter warp fields.

765
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,291
Thoughts became reality.

766
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,333
Now I'm in a warp field.

767
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:07,041
Could my thoughts
have changed this reality?

768
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:10,500
Come on, Beverly!

769
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:13,000
What's the next step?

770
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,291
What was I thinking at the
moment Wesley's bubble formed?

771
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,000
Dalen Quaice.

772
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,875
He said all the people
he'd known were gone.

773
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:27,625
I thought of Jack.
I went to see Wesley...

774
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:31,291
The flash in engineering...

775
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,417
<i>That's</i> when it started.

776
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:38,792
That's when...

777
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:41,500
<i>I</i> started losing everybody.

778
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:44,792
My thoughts created
this universe.

779
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:46,166
Can they get me
out of it again?

780
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,041
That information
is not available.

781
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,917
I'm not talking to you.

782
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:52,875
Click my heels together
three times

783
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,583
and I'm back in Kansas.

784
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:57,041
Can it be that simple?

785
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,458

786
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,125

787
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:21,291
Two minutes, 30 seconds
to life-support failure.

788
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:24,125
Computer,
hypothetical situation.

789
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:27,583
A person is trapped
inside of a static warp bubble.

790
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:28,792
Determine a means of escape.

791
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:30,750
Escape would
theoretically depend

792
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:32,625
on establishing
a stable threshold

793
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:35,333
between the warp field
and the outer environment.

794
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:37,083
Describe this threshold.

795
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,834

There are no known

796
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:41,667
practical applications
of this theory.

797
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:43,583
Extrapolate
from theoretical database.

798
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,166
How would it manifest itself?

799
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:47,375
A dynamic
atmospheric disturbance

800
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,458
of great intensity.

801
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,792
Disturbance?

802
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:55,792
The vortex.

803
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:59,917
They must have been trying
to reach<i> me.</i>

804
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:03,750
But how do I find it?

805
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:06,500
Wesley, where do I go?

806
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:08,959
Help me.

807
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:19,166
Stable threshold.

808
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:22,500
They've been trying to create
a stable threshold.

809
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:25,166
Where are they trying to do it?

810
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:28,041
Where did they do it
the first time?

811
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,583
Engineering.
