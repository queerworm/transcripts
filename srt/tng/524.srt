1
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:09,792
Time, Mr. Data?

2
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:11,458
We will arrive
within transporter range

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,333
in three minutes, 21 seconds.

4
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,041
I've finally established
audio contact

5
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,333
with the Romulan ship.

6
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,166
ROMULAN:
Our main power is failing.

7
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,959
There is no way
to stop the overload.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,166
<i>Enterprise</i>
to Romulan vessel.

9
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,834
We are en route
to your position.

10
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,250
ROMULAN: Enterprise,
what is your time of arrival?

11
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,458
We are facing an imminent
core breach...

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,917
Repeat your
last transmission.

13
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,083
I'm sorry, Captain.
They've stopped transmitting.

14
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,291
Picard to Riker.

15
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,875
Riker here.

16
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,250
PICARD: Transport to
the Romulan ship as soon

17
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,291
as we're within range.

18
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,917
Aye, sir.
No weapons.

19
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,917
We don't want them to think
they're under attack.

20
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:46,667
This is not
a bright idea.

21
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:48,417
I beg your pardon,
Ensign?

22
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,125
I didn't quite catch that.

23
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,875
Nothing, sir.

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,500
(<i> inaudible chatter</i> )

25
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,875
We're from the Federation
Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

26
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:46,458
We received your distress call.

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,583
The<i> Enterprise?</i> 
RIKER: That's right.

28
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,041
Your message said you had
suffered a failure

29
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,583
in your engine core.

30
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,834
ROMULAN: Yes, we had a
forced chamber explosion

31
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,417
in the resonator coil.

32
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a pretty strange setup

33
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,834
but it looks like
the graviton field generator's

34
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,834
been completely depolarized.

35
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:05,083
There's no way to fix it.
It'll have to be replaced.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,417
Where are your replicators?

37
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,959
They're off-line.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,542
Who's in charge here?

39
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,667
The captain is dead.

40
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,250
I'm the Science Officer Mirok.

41
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,583
We'd like to move
this generator

42
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,625
back to the<i> Enterprise</i>
for replication.

43
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,000
All right.

44
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,542
Geordi, you and Ro.

45
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,583
La Forge to Brossmer.

46
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,875
Two people and one piece
of equipment to beam aboard.

47
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,125
Aye, sir.

48
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,250
What the hell?

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,834
Engineering, I need more power

50
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,709
to the primary
energizing coil.

51
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,959
Brossmer to Commander Riker.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,583
I'm losing them.
I have to abort.

53
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:54,125
They should be returning
to your coordinates, sir.

54
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,166
Chief, do you have them?
They're not here.

55
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,875
BROSSMER:
No, sir.

56
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,375
Where are they?

57
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,834
I can't locate their patterns.

58
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,375
We've lost them, sir.

59
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:44,500
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

60
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:48,834
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

61
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,709
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,083
BROSSMER:
I've done all I can, sir.

66
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm afraid they're gone.

67
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,834
Mr. Data, begin
a level-one diagnostic.

68
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,959
All transporter systems
off-line until further notice.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,375
Could they have materialized
somewhere else?

70
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:13,875
Negative, Captain.

71
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:15,375
Sensors are unable
to locate them

72
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,000
anywhere within
transporter range.

73
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,333
Counselor?

74
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,000
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

75
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,834
Go ahead,
Number one.

76
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,417
Captain, we're still
looking at a core breach

77
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,875
unless we can fashion
a new graviton generator.

78
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:33,458
I need replacement
personnel, sir.

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,417
Mr. Data,
continue the diagnostic

80
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,333
of the transporter systems
at another time.

81
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,208
Take a shuttlecraft
and two more engineers

82
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,917
down to the Romulan ship.
Aye, sir.

83
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,583
Mr. McDowell, alert
the main shuttle bay

84
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,792
to have all available ships
and pilots standing by

85
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:47,375
in case we need them.
Aye, sir.

86
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:51,458
Ensign, lay in a course
away from the Romulan vessel,

87
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,750
And engage at warp one

88
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:56,000
if you detect any sign
it's going to explode.

89
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,125
The pressure in the
containment chamber

90
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,000
has increased 15 melakols
in the last two minutes.

91
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,375
What can we do
to stop the overload?

92
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:14,417
Most of the conduits
were damaged

93
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,792
during the explosion.

94
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,625
I can't even access
the central computer.

95
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,917
WORF:
Commander...

96
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,500
emergency bulkheads have
sealed this section off

97
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:25,917
from the rest of the ship.

98
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,458
There is no way to gain
access to the Main Bridge

99
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,709
or control centers.

100
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,291
Survivors?

101
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,458
Readings indicate at least
73 Romulans are still alive.

102
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,875
73.

103
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:39,583
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

104
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,875
The pressure has jumped
200 melakols!

105
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,375
I've lost control of the
containment chamber.

106
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:46,625
It's going to implode.

107
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,083
We need to dump the entire
engine core.

108
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,208
Do you have
an auto-eject system?

109
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,250
Yes, but it's
not functioning.

110
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,500
I'll have to
do it manually.

111
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,125
Mr. Worf, you two,
seal the chambers.

112
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,959
Implosion will occur in
one minute, five seconds.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,792
<i>Enterprise,</i> we need to jettison
the entire engine core.

114
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,083
You'll need to
extend the shields

115
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,458
once it clears the hull.

116
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,542
PICARD:
Understood, Number One.

117
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,667
We'll stand by for your signal.

118
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:35,959
We must get
the doors closed.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,458
(<i> grunting</i> )

120
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,583
Commander!

121
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,667
Time?

122
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,166
30 seconds.

123
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,291

125
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,542
Stay there!

126
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,417
Eject the chamber
on my order!

127
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,750
Excuse me, sir.

128
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,208
MIROK:
Implosion in five seconds.

129
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,250
Now.

130
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,959
<i>Enterprise,</i>
extend shields!

131
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,667
Well...
we're still here.

132
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,417
Yes.

133
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,458
RIKER: We'll have a
complete power survey

134
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,750
done within the hour.

135
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,208
We'll probably
have to supply them

136
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,750
with energy for life-support,

137
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,709
they'll need a new engine core
to get home.

138
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,166
Understood, Commander.

139
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,458
Keep me informed
of your efforts.

140
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,917
Picard out.

141
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,083
I'll be in Sick Bay.
Aye, sir.

142
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,917
Ensign Ro to the Bridge.

143
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,875
This is Ensign Ro
reporting in.

144
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:38,291
I'm at... Section 23 Baker,
near Sick Bay.

145
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,792
Sick Bay.

146
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,041
Excuse me,
I need some... help.

147
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,875
Excuse me.

148
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:26,667
Um, excuse me,
I need some help.

149
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,041
I...

150
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,750
Excuse me,
I need some help.

151
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,041
CRUSHER: We shouldn't make any
hasty decisions, Jean-Luc.

152
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,166
The transporter could have
beamed them somewhere else--

153
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,917
the Romulan ship, another deck
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

154
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,583
PICARD: We've checked
all those possibilities.

155
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,875
The initial findings
would seem to indicate

156
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,542
that there was
a radiation surge

157
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,625
from the Romulan engine core
which disrupted the signal.

158
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,000
They never rematerialized.
We should check again.

159
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,333
There might be something
that we overlooked--

160
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,792
Beverly, we've done
everything that we can.

161
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,959
You're right.

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,291
I just hate making out
death certificates.

163
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,458
CRUSHER: Does Ensign Ro
have any family?

164
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,750
Captain, I'm right here.

165
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,208
None that I know of.

166
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,000
But I'll check with the
Bajoran Liaison Office.

167
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,208
I'm not dead!

168
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,542
I'll have
the official reports

169
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,917
ready within the hour.

170
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,917
Captain, I don't know
what's going on.

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,542
(<i> gasps</i> )

172
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,041

Dr. Crusher?

174
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,750
Dr. Crusher, I'm right here.

175
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,625

179
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,917
Begin power transfer.

180
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,208
The power flow is consistent
at 400 kolems.

181
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,542
No fluctuations
in frequency.

182
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,625
The main power grid is on-line.

183
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,834
Picard to Riker.

184
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,500
Riker here.

185
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:07,041
Power transfer appears
stable on this end, Captain.

186
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,834
Good. What is the status of
the engine replacement?

187
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,333
RIKER:
Engineering is modifying

188
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,709
one of our subspace
resonators

189
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,959
to act as a new engine core.

190
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,166
It won't do more than warp two,
but it will get them home.

191
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,625
Very good.

192
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,583
Captain, the diagnostic
of the transporter system

193
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,667
shows an anomalous
energy fluctuation.

194
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:26,667
I will need to inspect
the imaging scanner

195
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,041
in Transporter Room Three.

196
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,125
By all means.

197
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,333
Captain...

198
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,875
I have a personal
favor to ask.

199
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:38,083
I considered Commander La Forge
to be... my best friend.

200
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,625
I believe it is my
responsibility

201
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,625
to plan and conduct
the memorial service.

202
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:45,041
May I have your permission
to do so?

203
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,667
Permission granted.

204
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,291
Make whatever arrangements
you think are appropriate.

205
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,208
Thank you, sir.

206
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:00,291
(<i> crew chattering</i> )

207
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,667
Commander, the...

208
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:15,792
the Romulans
want a computer.

209
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:18,458
We cannot give them access
to Federation technology.

210
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,250
That is an
unacceptable security risk.

211
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,875
What about a computer core
from 30 or 40 years ago?

212
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:29,834
One the Romulans are
already familiar with.

213
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,500
That would be satisfactory.

214
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,667
Check with the<i> Enterprise.</i> 
See what's available.

215
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:37,000
But be sure that your
concerns are addressed

216
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,166
before we install it.

217
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,875
Aye, sir.

218
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,291
Thank you.

219
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,250
RO:
La Forge?

220
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,333
Ro.

221
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,083
Boy, am I glad
to see you.

222
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,208
And I'm really glad
that you can see me.

223
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,875
It's like...

224
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:13,333
it's like I'm here,
but I'm not here.

225
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,375
No one can see me
either.

226
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:17,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

227
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,208
I can't figure it out.

228
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,625
One minute we were transporting
from the Romulan vessel

229
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:26,917
and the next

230
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,333
I wake up
in the arboretum

231
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,125
with a splitting headache.

232
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,834
Can you pass through
things like bulkheads?

233
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,667
Tables, people...
yeah.

234
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,750
Well, we're solid
enough to each other.

235
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,750
It's not what
you expected, is it?

236
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,709
(<i> sighs</i> )
What do you mean?

237
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,917
This.
Death.

238
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,458
What?

239
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,542
We're dead, Geordi.

240
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,667
Is that some
kind of a joke?

241
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:15,041
Our patterns were lost in
a transporter malfunction.

242
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,125
We never rematerialized after
leaving the Romulan ship.

243
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,542
Wait a minute.

244
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,792
What are you saying--

245
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,166
that we're some sort
of spirits?

246
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,834
Spirits, souls...

247
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,542
my people used to
call them<i> "borhyas."</i>

248
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,125
But whatever term you
wanna use, we're it.

249
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,959
But my uniform, my visor.

250
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,208
Are you saying I'm some
blind ghost with clothes?

251
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,166
I don't have all the answers.
I've never been dead before.

252
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,458
We are<i> not</i> dead.

253
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,417
According to Dr. Crusher

254
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,792
we died
in a transporter malfunction

255
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,583
at 1430 hours.

256
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,458
Geordi, I saw her make out
the death certificates.

257
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:06,291
We need to make peace
with our former lives.

258
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,250
That's what I was taught.

259
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,041
We have to say good-bye
to the people

260
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,125
who were in our lives.

261
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,250
No, you may be ready
for the afterlife

262
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,542
but I'm not.

263
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,834
I don't see that we have
much of a choice.

264
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,583
(<i> sighs</i> )

265
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,250
When I was growing up,
I never gave much thought

266
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,625
to all the talk about<i> borhyas.</i>
I figured that

267
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,375
it was just superstition
passed on to children.

268
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:30,709
Fine, you go make peace
with yourself, all right?

269
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,333
I'm going to
Transporter Room Three.

270
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,500
I'm gonna figure a way
out of this situation.

271
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,166
I didn't have any warning

272
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,625
that something
would go wrong, sir.

273
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,959
Suddenly, their patterns
just weren't there.

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,959
I believe the cause
of the accident

275
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,333
may be related to the
explosion on the Romulan ship.

276
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,709
Really?

277
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,000
But that happened
before we even arrived.

278
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,166
In all likelihood,
the explosion

279
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,250
damaged the Romulan
cloaking device,

280
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,917
causing it to discharge
chroniton particles.

281
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,166
I am detecting
a chroniton field in here.

282
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,792
Chroniton field?

283
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:17,583
If the particles were
produced on the Romulan ship,

284
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,458
why are you detecting
them here?

285
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,000
The transporter beam.

286
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,291
I suspect they traveled
through the transporter beam.

287
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,083
That may have been the cause
of Geordi and Ro's death.

288
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,000
I will go to
the Romulan ship.

289
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,041
Perhaps I can discover the
source of the emissions.

290
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,291
Commander, are these
chronitons dangerous?

291
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,333
They pose no danger
to humans.

292
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,792
However, some of the ship's
systems may have been affected

293
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,750
by prolonged exposure.

294
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:43,500
When I return, I will devise
a method to eradicate them.

295
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,083
La Forge to Ensign...

296
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,291
Thanks for the ride.

297
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,166
I'm here to say good-bye.

298
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,375
There were a lot
of what appeared to be

299
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:40,041
experimental engine components
lying around over there.

300
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,250
I'd say they were testing
a new warp drive design

301
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,709
and it blew up
in their faces.

302
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,333
PICARD: That would explain
why they're so far

303
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,291
from Romulan space--

304
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,500
to avoid being picked up
by Federation long-range scans.

305
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:54,083
We should have an engine core
ready for them by 1900 hours.

306
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,583
Commander, there will be
a memorial service

307
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,333
at 2300 hours.

308
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,458
Mr. Data is making
the arrangements.

309
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,917
I'll be there.

310
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,417
Me too.

311
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,166
In fact, I might like
to say a few words.

312
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,583
You did know La Forge
longer than any of us.

313
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,875
Actually, I was thinking
more about Ensign Ro.

314
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,458
Me?

315
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,375
PICARD: When you're ready,
coordinate with Mr. Data.

316
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,709
Wait a minute, what are you
gonna say about me?

317
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,792
Captain...

318
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't believe this.

319
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,667
I'm dead.

320
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:40,250
You can't even hear me,

321
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,000
and I'm still
intimidated by you.

322
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:53,125
I just... wanted to
say thank you...

323
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:58,417
for trusting in me
when no one else would.

324
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,250
Hey, there you are.

325
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,667
Excuse me, Captain.

326
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:06,625
Listen, Data's taking the
next shuttle back over

327
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,542
to the Romulan vessel,
and we need to be on it.

328
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,667
Why?

329
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:11,625
Because I think what
happened to us,

330
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,583
the answers
are over there.

331
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,333
Why can't you just
accept the fact--

332
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,792
Look, if you're right,
then we're dead

333
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:19,083
and this doesn't make
any difference.

334
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,166
But if I'm right,
then we're still alive,

335
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,792
and I'm gonna
need your help.

336
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,792
Lieutenant, I am planning
a memorial service

337
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:46,166
for Commander La Forge
and Ensign Ro.

338
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,333
I would like you
to participate.

339
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,125
What kind of service?

340
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,417
Captain Picard asked me

341
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,709
to arrange a ceremony
that was appropriate.

342
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,500
I have given
a great deal of thought

343
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:58,083
to what is appropriate
in this instance.

344
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,750
Sir, shuttlecraft four

345
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,709
has not yet cleared
the Romulan ship.

346
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,291
Hold position here.

347
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,417
This is weird

348
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,375
listening to them
plan our funeral.

349
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:07,792
I find I am having
difficulty

350
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:10,333
deciding what kind
of service to have.

351
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,625
Do you have
any suggestions?

352
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,959
Well, human custom is to conduct
a solemn, dignified service

353
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,083
in which the dead are praised
by their friends and loved ones.

354
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,500
Ensign Ro was a Bajoran.

355
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,417
Her beliefs should be
reflected as well.

356
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,875
However, their death rituals
are quite complicated.

357
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,959
Oh, please,
not the death chant.

358
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,083
The Bajoran death chant
is over two hours long.

359
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,667
I am not certain

360
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:38,792
that either human or
Bajoran rights are fitting.

361
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:40,625
And I have researched
the funerary customs

362
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,709
of over 5,000 cultures
to no avail.

363

364
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,959
Shuttlecraft four
has just cleared.

365
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Resume course.

366
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,709
In almost all societies

367
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,959
it is traditional
to say a ritual farewell

368
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,959
to those you call friends.

369
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,458
I never knew what a friend was
until I met Geordi.

370
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,041
He spoke to me
as though I were human.

371
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:06,125
He treated me no differently
from anyone else.

372
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:09,291
He accepted me
for what I am.

373
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,959
And that, I have learned,
is friendship.

374
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,542
But I do not know
how to say good-bye.

375
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,542
Seems almost human,
doesn't he?

376
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:24,875
Commander, I am not the proper
person to advise you.

377
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:26,834
Why?

378
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,583
I am very happy for
Commander La Forge.

379
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,458
He has crossed over

380
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,166
to that which is beyond.

381
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,875
For a Klingon,
this is a joyful time.

382
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:46,417
A friend has died
in the line of duty,

383
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:51,125
and he has earned a place
among the honored dead.

384
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,000
It is not a time to mourn.

385
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:59,041

387
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,542
Data, that's
a nice sentiment

388
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,917
but a little premature.

389
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:11,542
I don't plan on being
commemorated before my time.

390
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,458
I'm afraid I fail
to see the point

391
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,166
of this investigation,
Commander.

392
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,375
Chroniton emissions
may have been responsible

393
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:36,083
for the accident which claimed
the lives of our officers.

394
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,875
A most regrettable
event, of course.

395
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:41,875
Was your cloaking device
damaged in the explosion?

396
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:43,834
All of our systems
were damaged,

397
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,667
including
the cloaking device.

398
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:47,542
That explains
the chroniton fields

399
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,417
I am detecting in here now.

400
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,875
For your own safety,

401
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:52,917
it is important to
eliminate those emissions.

402
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,375
Our safety?

403
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:55,917
There is no way to
predict what will happen

404
00:24:55,959 --> 00:25:00,083
when the chronitons interact
with the new engine core.

405
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,208
I've never seen
anything like this.

406
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,542
There's something
in here

407
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,750
that looks like
a molecular phase inverter.

408
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,125
What's that?

409
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,917
It's supposed to change
the structure of matter

410
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:15,834
so it can pass through
normal matter and energy.

411
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,041
Hang on a second.

412
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,041
A few years back,
we got intelligence reports

413
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,375
that the Klingons
were working on

414
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:23,083
trying to combine
a phase inverter

415
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,875
and a cloaking device.

416
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,625
In theory, they believed
that a phased ship

417
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:29,083
could hide anywhere,
even inside a planet

418
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,542
and that conventional weapons
would be useless against it.

419
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,959
How far did they get
in their research?

420
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,667
Well, it never got out
of the preliminary stages.

421
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:36,166
There were several
accidents.

422
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:39,041
The Romulans might be
pursuing that same technology,

423
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:42,000
trying to combine an inverter
and a cloaking device.

424
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,542
And if this is
the prototype--

425
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,125
Then that would explain
the explosion

426
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,458
and the chroniton fields.

427
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,125
And us.

428
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,417
You mean, we're cloaked?

429
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,583
Not just cloaked-- phased.

430
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,875
Our entire
molecular structure

431
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:57,125
altered so that we--
we don't have any substance.

432
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:59,500
Then that would mean
we're not dead.

433
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:00,917
Yes, it would also mean

434
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:04,166
that there's probably
a way to de-phase us.

435
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,583
Field emissions are
particularly strong

436
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:13,834
in this area.

437
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,417
You can be assured
that the emissions

438
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:16,500
will be eliminated

439
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,500
before the engine core
is replaced.

440
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:21,417
WORF:
Commander, may I speak with you?

441
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:23,000
If they come back,

442
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,959
they're going to discover
the interphase generator.

443
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,500
Is their power transfer beam
still at full intensity?

444
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,000
Yes, it will be
until we're ready to

445
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,875
switch to internal power.

446
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,083
We will set up
a muon feedback wave

447
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,041
inside the transfer beam.

448
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,709
The particles will accumulate
in their dilithium chamber.

449
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,709
When they go to warp speed,
their engines will explode.

450
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:46,667
We've gotta get to the
<i>Enterprise</i> and warn them.

451
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:48,083
How?
I don't know,

452
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,667
but we have to find a way.

453
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,208
Come on.

454
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,083
The muon feedback wave's
not showing up

455
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,959
on any of the
engine displays.

456
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,458
The Romulans
must be hiding it

457
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,000
in the sensory
return signal.

458
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,875
Unless someone runs
a level three diagnostic

459
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:38,667
they'd never detect it.

460
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:40,083
There must be
some way to warn them

461
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,125
before the ship
goes into warp.

462
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:44,083
This is puzzling.

463
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,667
Three more chroniton fields
have formed

464
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:47,667
aboard the<i> Enterprise</i> 
in the last hour.

465
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,542
There's no reason why
the interphase device

466
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,750
would be producing
new fields onboard this ship.

467
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:54,041
We should begin
decontamination immediately.

468
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,583
Run an internal
sensor sweep

469
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,208
for the locations
of all chroniton fields

470
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,417
on the<i> Enterprise.</i> 
Aye, sir.

471
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:05,542

And I cannot see they have
anything in common.

482
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,125
Oh, yes they do.

483
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,166
In fact, they seem to be
appearing at random.

484
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,375
No, they're not!

485
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,208
We were in every one
of those locations.

486
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,250
Somehow, we're leaving
chroniton footprints behind us.

487
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:33,667
Can you narrow the focus
of the scan

488
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:35,041
to pinpoint the locations?

489
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,083
Not with the internal
sensors, Commander.

490
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:40,000
Go to Science Station Two
on the Main Bridge.

491

Use a lateral sensor array

492

to get a more
precise reading.

493
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:44,917
I will modify an anyon emitter

494
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,375
to eliminate the fields
once they've been isolated.

00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:48,625
Why don't you
go with her

496
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:49,709
and see what

passed through the wall,

random patterns,

534
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:56,208
It's me!

535
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,917
Ahh!

536
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:59,834
Watch where you point
that thing.

537
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:05,250
Wait a minute, Data.
I think you did something here.

538
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,583
It's not so easy
to push through anymore.

539
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,792
The molecules in my hand

540
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:15,250
must have been partially
de-phased by the anyon beam.

541
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,333
Data, if
a low-level beam

542
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,834
can bring my hand
part of the way back,

543
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:22,959
maybe a high-level beam can
bring me all the way back.

544
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,083
I'll just have to get you
to turn up the intensity so...

545
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,709
Hey, wait a minute.

546
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,709
Don't stop now.

547
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,208
No, no, no, no.
Data, don't give up on it.

548
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,333
It works.

549
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,041
I was just creating
more fields.

550
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,583
Your method is fine.

551
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:39,917
You just need to turn up
the intensity, Data.

552
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

553
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,875
He's in here.

554
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,792
Brossmer to Commander Data.

555
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:13,333
Data here.

556
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:14,875
BROSSMER: I've just detected
a large chroniton field

557
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,667
on Deck 17.

558
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:20,083
The field strength is 300% above
the others we've found, sir.

559
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,291
Is that Ro?
Acknowledged.

(<i> beeping intensifies</i> )

565
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,875
Get up!

566
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,792
Where is the science officer?

567
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,000
(<i> door chimes</i> )

568
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,000
(<i> grunts</i> )
MAN: I'll get it.

569
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:36,500
Commander!
Excuse me, Lieutenant--

570
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:38,166
Ro!
I'm detecting

571
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,250
a chroniton field
in your room.

572
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:41,458
May I scan the area?

573
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,125
MAN:
Certainly.

574
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,542
Thanks.

575
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,250
Any time.

576
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:08,875
There's still no indication
that the Romulans

577
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:11,667
have set up a muon wave
in our dilithium chamber.

578
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:14,291
It's there, and when
they go to warp--

579
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,709
MCDOWELL: Incoming message from
the Romulan ship, Captain.

580
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,625
On screen.

581
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,625
Now what?

582
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,458
MIROK: Installation of the new
engine core has been completed.

583
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,417
We are ready to switch to
internal power,<i> Enterprise.</i>

584
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:27,959
Understood.

585
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,542
Disconnect
the power transfer beam.

586
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,375
MIROK:
We are now on internal power.

587
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:38,041
Captain Picard, please accept
my sincere thanks

588
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,792
on behalf of the Romulan Empire.

589
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:41,208
Don't listen
to him, Captain.

590
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,542
It was our pleasure, Mirok.

591
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:47,250
And I hope that this
example of cooperation

592
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:49,083
between our two peoples

593
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,542
will not be
an isolated incident.

594
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:54,041
As do I, Captain.

595
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,083
Set a course for the
Garadius system, warp six.

596
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,458
Don't do it, sir!
Captain, wait, don't!

597
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,375
BROSSMER: Captain,
I'm still running

598
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:03,333
the decontamination program.

599
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,792
Mr. Data believes we shouldn't
engage the warp drive

600
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,083
until I've cleared all the
chroniton fields from the ship.

601
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,500
Very well, let me know
when you finish your sweep.

602
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:11,625
Yes, sir.

603
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,166
If we can get
to the locations

604
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:16,083
that she's decontaminating,
maybe the anyon emissions

605
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,834
would re-phase us enough
for someone to see us.

606
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,917
Yeah, well, the beam strength
will have to be pretty strong

607
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,250
in order for us
to be visible

608
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,125
for more than
a millisecond.

609
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:25,583
Somebody's gonna have to
be looking directly at us.

610
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,166
Then we're gonna
have to go somewhere

611
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,125
with an awful lot
of people.

612
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,291
It's time, sir.

613
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,875
We should go.

614
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,959
You have the Bridge,
Mr. McDowell.

615
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,250
I'll be at the
service in Ten Forward.

616
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,667
Ten Forward?
Well, that's perfect.

617
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,333
We'll create as many
chroniton fields

618
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,375
in there as we can,
get them to flood that room

619
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:50,959
with a stronger beam.

620
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,417
PICARD:
Deck ten.

621
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:02,041
I've been thinking
about the first time

622
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,917
I met Geordi La Forge.

623
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:06,542
He was a young officer
assigned to pilot me

624
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,542
on an inspection tour,

625
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,959
and I made some
offhand remark

626
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,959
about the... shuttle's
engine efficiency

627
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,625
not being
what it should.

628
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:20,000
And the next morning
I found that he'd stayed up

629
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:23,792
all night refitting
the fusion initiators.

630
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,667
Well, I knew then that
I wanted to have him

631
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:31,166
with me on my
next command.

632
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,291
Have you decided what you're
gonna say about Ensign Ro?

633
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:39,166
Yes, I have.

634
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,583
Wasn't easy.
Situations like these...

635
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,333
What?
...are never easy,

636
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,041
Number One.
What wasn't easy?

637
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:49,041
(<i> Dixieland band playing</i> )

638
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,959
What?!

640
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,834
What is going on here?

641
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:22,166
It's our
memorial service.

642
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,792
This?

643
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:25,375
Why not?

644
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:27,000
I don't believe this.

645
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,959
They think we're dead
and they're having a party?

646
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,125
(<i> chuckles</i> )
Yeah. It's perfect.

647
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,875
Come on,
let's get started.

648
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,333
Well, this is... unusual.

649
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:49,125
Yeah.
I think I like it.

650
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,000
(<i> begins playing trombone</i> )

651
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:03,375
Now, I suppose
I'll never know

652
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:05,417
what you were gonna
say about me.

653
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:15,625
Do you think the others will
find this service appropriate?

654
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,458
Look around you, Data.

655
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,125
Everybody's sharing
their memories

656
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,834
of Geordi and Ro,
laughing and talking.

657
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,834
What could be more
appropriate than that?

658
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:25,375
I am glad you approve.

659
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:27,000
Brossmer to Commander Data.

660
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,291
Go ahead, Chief.

661
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,834
BROSSMER: I'm sorry
to disturb you, sir.

662
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,041
We've cleared the critical
areas of chronitons,

663
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,417
but we've detected a new
field forming in Ten Forward

664
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,792
that's stronger than any
we've seen before.

665
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:38,792
Should I wait till
after the service is over

666
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:40,500
before beginning
decontamination?

667
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:42,458
No, anyon emissions
are harmless.

668
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,709
Please begin
immediately.

669
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,500
BROSSMER:
Aye, sir.

670
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:47,166
Here we go.

00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,792
Worf, can you see us?

674
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,792
Lieutenant?
We're right here, Worf.

675
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,792
(<i> scoffs</i> )
Damn.

676
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:01,166
We have to find
a way to increase

677
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,709
the emission strength.
Yeah, I know.

678
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,500
If she hadn't lost
her rank as a result

679
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,667
of that incident at Garon IV,

680
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,917
I think she would have made
lieutenant commander by now.

681
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,291

682
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,041
Go ahead.
MCDOWELL: Incoming message

683
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,458
from Garadius IV, sir.

684
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,417
The diplomatic situation
is deteriorating.

685
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,125
They want an
update on our ETA.

686
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,792
Stand by, Ensign.
Excuse me.

687
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:23,083
We have to do something now
before they go into warp.

688
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:26,000
The disruptor-- I can
put it on overload.

689
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,417
Do it.

690
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,125
Let's go.

691
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:49,208
I would like to get
underway as soon as possible.

692
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,917
The situation on Garadius IV
is becoming serious.

693
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:54,375
I see no reason to
delay our departure.

694
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:55,750
The chroniton fields
have been cleared

695
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,208
from all critical areas.

696
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,291
Excellent.

697
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,917
Mr. McDowell, will you
set a course

698
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,500
for Garadius IV
and engage--

699
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:03,458
BROSSMER: Commander data,
chroniton field strength

700
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,834
in Ten Forward has just
increased by 3,000%.

701
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,333
Curious.

702
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,792
Captain, I believe we
should decontaminate

703
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:12,291
this room before
getting underway.

704
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:14,000
Very well.
Chief?

705
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:15,125
BROSSMER:
Yes, Commander?

706
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:16,542
Increase
anyon emissions

707
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,625
to 6,000 particles
per second

708
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,166
and decontaminate
this area.

709
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:23,375
Okay, hang on.

710
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,792
Data, Data, do you see us?
Captain!

711
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:29,959
We're right here!
We're right here!

712
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,417
We're right here!

713
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:35,458
Do you see that,
Mr. Data?

714
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Yes, sir.

715
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:40,417
Come on, Data, put it
all together now.

716
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:44,375
Those were not ghosts.
What did we see?

717
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:46,333
I believe I may know
what has happened, sir.

718
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,500
Oh, Data,
please, be right!

719
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:51,208
It would explain the mysterious
chroniton fields...

720
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,917
Yes, yes, yes!

721
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:55,917
...if they were
cloaked in some way.

722
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:58,166
Are you saying that
they're still alive?

723
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,250
If I am right,
sir, they are,

724
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,792
and in this room.

725
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,542
Their brief appearance
coincided

726
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,834
with the anyon sweep.

727
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,542
Perhaps the anyons

728
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:10,166
neutralized
the cloaking effect.

729
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:12,375
Chief Brossmer.
BROSSMER: Yes, Commander?

730
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:14,875
Set the anyonic beam
to its highest level

731
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:16,291
and flood Ten Forward.

732
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:18,166
BROSSMER:
Aye, sir.

733
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,875
Data, do you see us?

734
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:36,125
Of course.

735
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,583
La Forge to Engineering. Take
the warp engines

736
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,458
off-line until
further notice.

737
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,500
There's a muon wave building up
inside the dilithium chamber.

738
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:50,667
MCDOWELL:
Captain, who gave that order?

739
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,959
That was Commander
Geordi La Forge, Ensign.

740
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,417
Please follow his
instructions.

741
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,917
MCDOWELL:
Aye, sir.

742
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:58,417
Well, it looks like
a great party.

743
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,625
You mind if
we join you?

744
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:03,583
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

745
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:20,291
Geordi, it is good
to see you.

746
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,333
Thanks, Data.

747
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:25,125
I've never been to
a better funeral.

748
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:43,291
Mm, could you
pass the rolls?

749
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:48,792
You've been eating
for over an hour.

750
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,458
Come on.

751
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,375
We didn't eat for
almost two days.

752
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:53,667
I'm hungry.

753
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,166
What's wrong?

754
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,375
Nothing.

755
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:04,250
Come on.

756
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:14,333
I was raised with
Bajoran beliefs

757
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:19,125
and I even followed
some of the practices.

758
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:22,542
But I never really believed
in a life after death.

759
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,959
And then suddenly,
I<i> was</i> dead,

760
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,875
and there<i> was</i>
this other life,

761
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,208
And it made me feel like
I'd been pretty arrogant

762
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,333
to discount everything
I'd been taught, you know?

763
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:45,959
Now, I don't know
what to believe.

764
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,250
Hmm, well...

765
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:51,291
maybe we should develop
our own interphase device.

766
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,083
If it can teach
Ro Laren humility...

767
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,125
it can do anything.

768
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:02,709
(<i> both laughing</i> )
