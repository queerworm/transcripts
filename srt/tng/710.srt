00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:05,333
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47410.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:07,792
<i>The Atrean government</i>
<i>has requested assistance</i>

3
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:09,834
<i>in averting a natural disaster.</i>

4
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,917
<i>Two of their geologists</i>
<i>have come aboard</i>

5
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:15,041
<i>one of whom is a human who</i>
<i>has been living on Atrea IV.</i>

6
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:17,959
Captain, the situation
has worsened

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,417
since my husband and I
first contacted you.

8
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:24,250
The molten core of our
planet isn't just cooling--

9
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,000
it's begun to solidify.

10
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,166
MAN:
Our gravitational field
has been affected.

11
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,625
Seismic activity has increased
by a factor of three.

12
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:34,375
If the cooling
continues at this rate

13
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:37,083
Atrea will become
uninhabitable

14
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,250
in 13 months.

15
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,041
LA FORGE:
We could minimize

16
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,417
seismic activity by creating
isobaric fissures and relieving

17
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,000
some of the tectonic stress

18
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,250
but that would just
be a temporary fix.

19
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,542
The only
permanent solution

20
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,542
would be to reliquefy
the core.

21
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,917
These pockets
in the magma layer--

22
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,125
how close are they

23
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,917
to the molten region
of the core?

24
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,834
A few kilometers.
Why?

25
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,333
Data, you think
that's close enough

26
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,750
for ferroplasmic infusion?

27
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,917
The procedure will involve
using the ship's phasers

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,208
to drill down through
the planet's surface

29
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,625
into the pockets,
where we would set up

30
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,959
a series of plasma
infusion units.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,041
We'll trigger the units

32
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,583
by firing modulated
energy bursts

33
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,250
down through the shafts.

34
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,834
I see.

35
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:21,083
Injecting plasma
directly into the core

36
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,083
should trigger
a chain reaction

37
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,917
and that will reliquefy
the magma.

38
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,083
It should be possible

39
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,625
to stabilize
the core temperature

40
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,583
at 93% of normal.

41
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,875
If it works

42
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,291
the core would remain
molten for centuries.

43
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,083
If you'll give your permission,
we could begin immediately.

44
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:39,792
Very well.

45
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:41,125
But before we proceed

46
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,667
I'd like to update
our geological surveys.

47
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,250
Fine. I'd be very happy to
help you with that, Doctor.

48
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,333
We've assigned you quarters
during our time here.

49
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,208
Please make yourselves
comfortable.

50
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,375
Thank you, Captain.

51
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:55,875
Data?

52
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes, Doctor.

53
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,500
Do you have
any idea who I am?

54
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,125
You are
Dr. Juliana Tainer.

55
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,125
Oh, you lost all your
early memories.

56
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,875
We thought you would,
but we couldn't be certain.

57
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,750
Have we met before?

58
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,291
Oh, Data,
I was there

59
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,458
right at the beginning
on Omicron Theta.

60
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,667
I helped create you.

61
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,583
And now...
look at you.

62
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,375
You were a colleague
of Dr. Soong?

63
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,542
I most certainly was...

64
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,291
and I was
also his wife.

65
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,500
In a way, I suppose
you could say

66
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:37,875
I am your mother.

67
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,917
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

68
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:17,709
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,542
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

70
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,709
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

71
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,166
<i>... to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

72
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,083
<i>... to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

73
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,959
I just can't believe

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,875
I'm seeing you
like this again

75
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:36,834
after all these years.

76
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,792
Doctor, I have
no memory of you.

77
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,750
Oh, there's
a reason for that.

78
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,792
We wiped your
processors

79
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:44,875
after we finished
refining your programming.

80
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,917
Why don't you tell me
what you do remember

81
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,000
and then
I'll fill in the gaps.

82
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,583
My memory record begins

83
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,792
when I was activated
by the Starfleet officers

84
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,834
on the Omicron
Theta outpost.

85
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,709
Ah, after the attack
of the Crystalline Entity.

86
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,458
Yes. All of the inhabitants
of the colony were killed.

87
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,417
However, I discovered
that my memory banks

88
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,291
contain the contents
of their journals and logs.

89
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,291
We hoped their experiences
would be useful.

90
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,750
After your childhood

91
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,750
we figured you could use
all the help you could get.

92
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,542
"My childhood?"

93
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,709
Oh, well, that's
what I called it.

94
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,959
Well, you<i> were</i> like
a baby, at first...

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,667
a 100-kilogram baby,
but still.

96
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,375
You had trouble, uh,

97
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,959
learning
your motor skills

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,375
learning how to process
sensory information

99
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,959
and, of course, Noonien
was never satisfied.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
He kept tinkering

101
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:42,917
trying to make you
as human as possible.

102
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,125
So you wiped
my memory processors

103
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,667
after this "childhood"?

104
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,041
Mm-hmm.

105
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,458
Then we deactivated you

106
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,166
and programmed you
with the colonists' logs.

107
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,291
We had planned to
reactivate you

108
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,041
but we never
got the chance.

109
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,500
That's when the Crystalline
Entity attacked.

110
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:03,792
We had to
leave quickly.

111
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:06,959
We wanted to take you
with us

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
but there was only room
for two in the escape pod.

113
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,291
Doctor, I have scanned

114
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,500
the journals
of the colonists.

115
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,625
There is only one Juliana
mentioned in them.

116
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,458
Her last name
was O'Donnell.

117
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,125
That's me.

118
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,291
But there was no mention that
my father was married to you.

119
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,750
Because of my mother.

120
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,125
She thought that Noonien
was an eccentric scientist

121
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,417
who was far too
old for me.

122
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,333
We decided to marry secretly

123
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,375
to give her a chance to get
used to our being together.

124
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,750
We slipped away to Mavala IV
and got married there.

125
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:49,500
A Klingon and a Corvallen
trader were our witnesses.

126
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,792
It wasn't exactly the wedding
I'd hoped for, but...

127
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,250
(<i> chuckles</i> )

128
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,667
somehow, Noonien had a way

129
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,375
of making even the oddest
things seem romantic.

130
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,458
My father did have an unusual
way of looking at things.

131
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,041
How would you know that?

132
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:09,083
I encountered him once
in the Terlina system.

133
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,125
Why, that's where we went to,
after we left the outpost.

134
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,208
I'd no idea
that you'd even met him.

135
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:16,834
It was shortly
before his death.

136
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,417
He's dead?

137
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:24,959
Yes.

138
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:28,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

139
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,041
I had no idea
it would hit me this hard.

140
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,083
We didn't exactly part
on the best of terms.

141
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,208
What do you mean?

142
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,750
Oh, I realized
he loved his work

143
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:44,959
as much as he
loved me...

144
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,792
maybe more.

145
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,792
Oh, there we were
stuck out on this planet

146
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,083
in the middle of
the jungle

147
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,625
with no one else
to talk to...

148
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,959
no... life.

149
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,792
It just wasn't enough.

150
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,208
That's why I left.

151
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,709
But that was all a very,
very long time ago.

152
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:19,917
The important thing is
that we're here now, together

153
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,875
and I<i> do</i> want to get
to know you.

154
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,125
This has been
an interesting encounter

155
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,458
and an altogether
unexpected one.

156
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,959
I would like
to corroborate

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,291
your story before
we proceed further.

158
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,542
Excuse me, Doctor.

159
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,583
Data, I'm almost
finished

160
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,250
reconfiguring
the phaser banks.

161
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,583
We should be able to start
drilling in about an hour.

162
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,000
Inform me
when you are ready.

163
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,375
What is it you're
doing over there?

164
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:57,834
I am attempting
to ascertain

165
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,792
whether Dr. Tainer's
story is true.

166
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,750
Don't you
believe her?

167
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,709
I neither believe
nor doubt.

168
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,500
I am simply trying
to verify her assertions.

169
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,166
Well, what have you
turned up so far?

170
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,959
The registrar's office
on Mavala IV

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,667
cannot confirm whether
Dr. Soong was married there.

172
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,417
Apparently, many of
the documents were lost

173
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,458
when the government
was overthrown.

174
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,417
What's that
you're looking at?

175
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,333
I am checking
passenger manifests

176
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,792
to see if they went to
Mavala IV

177
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,208
during
the period in question.

178
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,458
"O'Donnell, Juliana."

179
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,917
"Soong, Noonien."

180
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,041
They were both passengers
on a transport which traveled

181
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,875
from Omicron Theta to Mavala

182
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,917
and returned
four days later.

183
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,500
That sure fits
with her story.

184
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,375
Still, the fact that
they went to Mavala

185
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:49,917
does not prove
they were married there.

186
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,291
You know, Data,
it almost seems to me

187
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,583
like you're trying
to prove

188
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,917
that Dr. Tainer
wasn't telling the truth.

189
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,417
Not at all.

190
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,166
I am merely unable
to reconcile her story

191
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,583
with the fact that my father
never mentioned her to me.

192
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,792
Well, she did leave him.

193
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,166
Maybe she broke
his heart.

194
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,333
Maybe he just didn't
want to talk about her.

195
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,041
Let me ask you this.

196
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:17,834
Dr. Soong created
an emotion chip for you

197
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,041
and didn't Lore tell you

198
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,208
that that chip also
contained memories--

199
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,375
memories Soong
wanted you to have?

200
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,875
Yes.

201
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,333
It is possible that those
are memories of my childhood

202
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,417
and of Mrs. Soong.

203
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,875
And when you think about it,
why would she want to lie?

204
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,000
Why would anybody want to
pretend to be your mother?

205
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,375
I can think of no motive
for such a pretense.

206
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:41,750
You know, I can understand

207
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,542
that this might
all be a little

208
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,125
disconcerting
for you, Data.

209
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,375
It came
out of the blue

210
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:48,667
and it doesn't fit

211
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,792
into your
logical processors.

212
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:51,917
That is true.

213
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,458
But that's life, Data.

214
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,875
Part of being human

215
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,917
is learning how to deal
with the unexpected.

216
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,542
To risk new experiences

217
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,625
even when they don't fit
into your preconceptions.

218
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,000
I admit
I am finding it difficult

219
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,250
to accept the possibility
of a past

220
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,625
about which
I know nothing.

221
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,917
But it is also true

222
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,792
I am curious
to learn more about it.

223
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,250
Data?

224
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,166
I would like to get
to know you better...

225
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,000
Mother.

226
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,458
I wanted to make
you female

227
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,750
but your father
insisted on a son.

228
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:54,375
Oh, we argued
about it endlessly

229
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:56,709
right up until we were
ready to assemble you.

230
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,250
How did you decide?

231
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,959
Oh, Noonien walked in
with your head in his hand

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,875
and, innocent as you please,
said it was up to me.

233
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,709
Well, he knew perfectly
well what he was doing.

234
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,792
Once again, he had made it
in his own image.

235
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,125
I mean, what
could I possibly say?

236
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,041
Deanna Troi?

237
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,542
Is that who you're
going to visit?

238
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,709
Yes.

239
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,500
Oh, your father
would be so pleased.

240
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,083
Pleased?

241
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, he was worried
that the sexuality program

242
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,625
he designed for you
wouldn't work.

243
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,959
You misunderstand.

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,583
Counselor Troi
is a therapist.

245
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,834
Good night.

246
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,750
We will be in position
over the drilling site

247
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,625
in three minutes,
29 seconds.

248
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,333
These scans indicate
that the magma pockets

249
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,250
where we planned to set up
the infusion units

250
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,458
are somewhat unstable.

251
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,542
Well, I'm going to monitor

252
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,208
the density of
the rock layers

253
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,583
and adjust the strength of
the particle beam as we go.

254
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,625
That should minimize
the seismic stress

255
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,750
that we'll generate
while we're drilling.

256
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,542
Data, I reconfigured
the phasers

257
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,917
to create the most
highly focused

258
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,166
particle beam possible.

259
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,333
Thank you, Geordi.

260
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,625
(<i> chuckling</i> )

261
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,333
I'm just so pleased
you've got good manners.

262
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,834
It wasn't easy to strike
the right balance

263
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,667
with your
programming.

264
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,542
Well, at first, you
couldn't have cared less

265
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,792
about the social niceties

266
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,083
like "please"
and "thank you."

267
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,125
You were downright
rude, in fact.

268
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:28,792
Data?

269
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,583
Well, that's hard
to picture.

270
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,458
Well, that was nothing

271
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,917
to the problems
we encountered...

272
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:37,792
Never mind.

273
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:39,792
I don't want
to embarrass you.

274
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,625
I am incapable
of embarrassment.

275
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:42,875
Please continue.

276
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,834
Well, the one thing
that we couldn't anticipate

277
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,583
was that you didn't seem
to mind about being

278
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,083
uh... naked.

279
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,709
Some of the colonists
objected to having

280
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,625
an anatomically correct
android running around

281
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,083
without any
clothes on.

282
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,959
Oh, we asked you to dress

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,667
but you didn't feel
it was necessary

284
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:06,917
because you didn't
suffer from the elements.

285
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:11,875
We actually had to write
a modesty subroutine

286
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,458
to get you to
keep your clothes on.

287
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,041
Riker to engineering.

288
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,166
La Forge here.
Go ahead, Commander.

289
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,417
We've established synchronous
orbit over the drilling site.

290
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,583
Phaser modifications
are on line, sir.

291
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,667
My calculations
indicate

292
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,000
that the first phaser blast

293
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,500
will be approximately
19 seconds in duration.

294
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:30,709
Acknowledged.

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,834
Someone's checked his
calculations, of course.

296
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,709
No, but I'm sure Mr. Data
knows what he's doing.

297
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,458
Even so, he is
a machine.

298
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,792
Someone should
check up on him.

299
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:44,875
I have complete confidence
in Mr. Data's ability

300
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,375
to check up on himself.

301
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,709
Mr. Worf?

302
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,959
Phasers locked
on target.

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,041
Fire when ready.

304
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:59,875
We are within two kilometers
of the magma pocket.

305
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,709
Another five seconds
should do it.

306
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,583
We've broken through.

307
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,208
Terminating the beam.

308
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,417
Oh, the pocket
seems stable.

309
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:14,709
I detect no increase

310
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,250
in the stress levels
of the surrounding magma.

311
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,834
RIKER:
Good work, Data.

312
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't think we could
have gotten in any cleaner.

313
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,417
JULIANA:
We have Data to
thank for that.

314
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,083
I couldn't have done it
without him.

315
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,500
His figures
were perfect.

316
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,041
The drilling process

317
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,583
has increased the temperature
in the magma pockets

318
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,208
by almost
300 degrees Celsius.

319
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,375
It will be several hours

320
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,333
before it cools enough
for us to enter.

321
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,542
(<i> sigh of relief</i> )

322
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,208
Data, do you have
any plans right now?

323
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,750
I do not.

324
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,875
Maybe we should spend
a little time together.

325
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,500
I'd love to see
your quarters.

326
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,250
(<i> classical violin</i>
<i>music playing</i> )

327
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,166
Thank you.

328
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,041
I will be playing this piece
at a recital tomorrow evening.

329
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,333
That was beautiful.

330
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,792
Hmm.

331
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:39,208
I have been told
that my playing

332
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,667
is technically flawless

333
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,917
but no one has ever described
it as beautiful.

334
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,959
It was. Really.

335
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,959
Are you certain
you are not saying this

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,417
because you are
my mother?

337
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,834
(<i> laughing</i> )

338
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,000
I have noticed that parents
tend to exaggerate

339
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,959
when it comes to their
children's accomplishments.

340
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,875
Oh, I suppose
there's a certain amount

341
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:03,041
of vanity involved

342
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:07,417
considering that giving you
a creative aspect was my idea.

343
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,083
Oh, your father didn't
really see the point.

344
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,959
He thought that since
you didn't have emotions

345
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,917
there would be no real need
for you to express yourself.

346
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,291
Somehow, I had the feeling

347
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,166
that the opposite
would be true.

348
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,542
I do not know for certain,

349
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:29,875
but I believe it is during
my creative endeavors

350
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,917
that I come closest
to experiencing

351
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,083
what it must be
like to be human.

352
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,583
Well, I'm glad
I insisted.

353
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:40,875
As am I.

354
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,125
Data...

355
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,667
I'm very familiar
with that Handel piece.

356
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:50,750
How would you feel about

357
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:53,166
my playing
the viola part tomorrow?

358
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,917
I would like
that very much.

359
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,834
Well, I'll have to
practice.

360
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,750
You don't happen
to have a viola?

361
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,500
I could replicate
one for you.

362
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,375
Computer, please
replicate one viola.

363
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,500
Did you paint these?

364
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:14,583
Yes.

365
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,792
I am attempting
to master

366
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:18,166
all known
styles of painting.

367
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,458
Oh!

368
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:22,166
This one is
in the style

369
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,166
of the early French
Impressionists.

370
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,375
Oh, it's very good.

371
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,542
Who's this?

372
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,125
That is Lal,
my daughter.

373
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,166
Your daughter?

374
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,875
I created her
using myself as a model.

375
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,458
Where is she now?

376
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,125
The positronic matrix
I designed for her

377
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,542
was unstable.

378
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,291
She only lived
a short time.

379
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,625
I see.

380
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,750
In a sense, you were
her grandmother.

381
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,792
Would you like
to practice now?

382
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,959
Yes. Yes, of course.

383
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,542
(<i> playing classical music</i> )

384
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,834
The acoustics in Ten-Forward
are most favorable.

385
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,834
Yes. Yes, very nice.

386
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,375
Data, may I ask
you something?

387
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,250
Of course.

388
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,959
Do you think
you'll ever try to create

389
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,250
an android again?

390
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,500
Perhaps.

391
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:56,250
I created Lal because
I wished to procreate.

392
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,291
Despite what happened to her,
I still have that wish.

393
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,000
But how do you know
the same thing won't happen?

394
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:08,041
Creating a stable positron
matrix is very tricky.

395
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,125
Your father lost

396
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,166
several prototypes
before Lore.

397
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,250
I was not aware
he created other

398
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,834
androids before
my brother.

399
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,709
There were
three of them.

400
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,667
They were like
children to us.

401
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,667
Losing them
was very painful.

402
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,500
When Noonien decided
to try again

403
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:31,625
I was very
much against it.

404
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:32,959
I didn't think we had

405
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,375
the right to bring a life
into the world

406
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,041
with so little
chance of surviving.

407
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,250
But your father was sure

408
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,250
that he'd figured out
what went wrong.

409
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,625
He insisted he could make
a stable matrix, and he did.

410
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,959
But Lore was...
cruel...

411
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,500
evil.

412
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,125
Eventually,
we had no choice.

413
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,667
We had to dismantle him.

414
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,375
Your father decided to build
yet another android--

415
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:07,875
one who
didn't have emotions.

416
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:10,667
I couldn't believe...

417
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,375
he would
want to try again.

418
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:15,041
<i>I</i> am that android.

419
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,208
Are you saying you were
against my creation?

420
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,250
Initially I was,
but I was wrong.

421
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,500
I know that now.

422
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,709
I followed your
progress for years.

423
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,875
I'm very proud of what
you've accomplished.

424
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,834
Then, why did you never
attempt to contact me?

425
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,750
Because I felt guilty
about something I'd done.

426
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,458
Perhaps if you told me what
has made you feel this way

427
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,834
it would
alleviate the guilt.

428
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:57,375
I lied...

429
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:59,625
when I said there
was no room for you

430
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:02,000
in the escape pod
we took from Omicron.

431
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,125
(<i> voice breaking</i> ):
There was.

432
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,542
I didn't want to
bring you with us.

433
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,875
I was afraid
if we reactivated you

434
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,792
you'd turn out like Lore.

435
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,834
I made Noonien
leave you behind.

436
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,166
We are within
four kilometers

437
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,542
of the magma pocket.

438
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,750
We're picking up feedback pulses
along the particle beam.

439
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,625
We must have hit
a pocket of magnesite ore.

440
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,250
I'll try to adjust the phaser
harmonics to compensate.

441
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,834
RIKER:
Data, we're going to have

442
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,667
to terminate the beam
if this keeps up.

443
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:03,291
If we do, we will have
to begin a new shaft

444
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,792
at a suitable location.

445
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:06,625
There is no other
suitable location.

446
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,000
Just give me
a few more seconds.

447
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,959
Doctor, it's going to take
longer than that to match the...

448
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:17,291
You did it.

449
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,834
It was just luck
I hit the right frequency.

450
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,208
All right, we're less
than two kilometers away

451
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,625
from the target site.

452
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,542
Stand by to
terminate the beam.

453
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,291
We've broken through.

454
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,417
Now!

455
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:34,041
I am detecting no signs
of instability.

456
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,667
Commander, may I suggest
we set up the infusion unit

457
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:38,250
in the first magma pocket

458
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,875
and give this one
a chance to cool?

459
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,667
Data, Dr. Tainer

460
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:44,333
we'll meet you
in transporter room two.

461
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,625
Acknowledged.

462
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,834
I have initialized
the plasma induction coils.

463
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,750
I'll need another minute
to align the diverter.

464
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,917
There are signs of stress
in the surrounding magma

465
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,500
but the site
should remain stable

466
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,834
until we finish
the plasma infusion.

467
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,458
Good.
We're almost through here.

468
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,000
Data...

469
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,166
Juliana told me what she
said to you last night.

470
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,375
She's been
very upset.

471
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,583
I don't blame you
for being angry with her...

472
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,333
I am incapable
of anger.

473
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,834
It's all right, Pran.

474
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,250
I know what
I said to you

475
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,375
must have been hard
for you to hear

476
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,291
but I hope you
understand my reasons.

477
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,667
I am not certain I do.

478
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:53,458
Perhaps you could
clarify them for me.

479
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,250
Well, I'll try.
What do you want to know?

480
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,041
If I had been
your biological offspring

481
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,083
would you have left me
on Omicron Theta?

482
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,625
Oh, Data...

483
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,208
how can I answer that?

484
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,834
Dr. Tainer,
I get the impression

485
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,125
you are trying to spare
my feelings.

486
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,083
I assure you

487
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,583
that is not
necessary.

488
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,542
I just don't want you to
misunderstand my answer.

489
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,583
No, I wouldn't have
left you behind

490
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,333
if you'd been
my biological child.

491
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,750
Hmm. Is that because you
place more value

492
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:35,625
on biological life
than artificial life?

493
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,166
Absolutely not.

494
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,959
I cherished every android
your father and I created

495
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,875
as if it<i> were</i> my child.

496
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,542
Even Lore.

497
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,125
Despite the fact
that he turned on us

498
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,333
despite the dreadful
things he did

499
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:48,792
dismantling him was

500
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,750
was the most difficult
thing I ever had to do.

501
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,125
I was afraid that if you
turned out like him

502
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:53,834
I would have
to dismantle you, too.

503
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,000
And I couldn't
bear to do that.

504
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:06,834
I'm not trying to justify
leaving you behind.

505
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:10,625
I'm just sorry I did.

506
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:14,083
I hope you
believe me.

507
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:16,834
I do.

508
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,583
Thank you for making
it clear to me.

509
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,333
(<i> classical music playing</i> )

510
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,667
Just wonderful.

511
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:17,000
Bravo.

512
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,792
Data, why do you
want to look at

513
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:25,917
Dr. Tainer's medical records?

514
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,542
Is something
wrong with her?

515
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,250
I was hoping you would
be able to determine that

516
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:30,959
from her transporter
trace pattern.

517
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,667
Well, probably
I could

518
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:34,125
but ordinarily I don't check

519
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,500
somebody's medical status
without a good reason.

520
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:39,625
Doctor, I would ask
that you not require me

521
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,333
to be more specific.

522
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:42,500
I assure you

523
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:44,625
I have a good reason
for asking.

524
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,083
All right, Data.

525
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,750
At first glance,
I see nothing wrong with her

526
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:01,000
except for a mild case
of hypertension

527
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,500
which is normal
for a woman her age.

528
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,917
I see.

529
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,250
Maybe you should tell me
what her symptoms are.

530
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,959
She has not complained
of any discomfort.

531
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,834
Then why do you want to
see her medical records?

532
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:17,125
Because I have
reason to believe

533
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,959
she is not who
she claims to be.

00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,792
Go ahead, sir.

536
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,125
There's been a cave-in
in one of the magma pockets.

537
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,041
You're needed
in transporter room two.

538
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,041
On my way.

539
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,125
Excuse me, Doctor.

540
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,083
What happened?

541
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,291
We were running
a final check

542
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,375
on the infusion units

543
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,458
when a part of
the wall gave way.

544
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,291
It looks like the area
has stabilized

545
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,250
but seismic
stress is building up.

546
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,083
Eventually the pocket
will collapse.

547
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,542
RIKER:
How long, Geordi?

548
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:48,834
It's tough to tell,
Commander.

549
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,709
12 hours at most.

550
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,792
Then we must finish
configuring the unit

551
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,834
and inject the plasma
immediately.

552
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:58,166
I'd rather not send
anyone back down there.

553
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,792
If you don't do it
now, Commander

554
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:02,417
it may take months to
find another suitable site.

555
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,333
The core may
solidify by then.

556
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,000
She's right.
We have to act now.

557
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,834
All right, but I want you
in and out of there

558
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:08,959
as quickly as possible.

559
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,125
Acknowledged.

560
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,333
You're hurt.
I'll go.

561
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,417
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

562
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,041
(<i> rumbling</i> )

563
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,333
(<i> gasps</i> )

564
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,500
There will be more
seismic activity.

565
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:01,750
We must hurry.

566
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:33,834
The shaft has not been
obstructed

567
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,417
by seismic activity.

568
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,583
It should be
possible

569
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,500
to trigger
the unit from orbit.

570
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:39,917
The infuser's been damaged.

571
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,166
We're going to
have to start

572
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,333
the programming sequence
all over again.

573
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,834
Priming the energy
transfer matrix.

574
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,375
Reinitializing
the particle stream buffer.

575
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:51,709
Riker to Data.
Are you there?

576
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,291
Go ahead, sir.

577
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,083
We're reading an increase
in seismic stress levels.

578
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,375
Understood, sir.

579
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:58,917
We will attempt to
expedite our work.

580
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:04,542
There. Now we just have
to realign the diverter.

581
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,500
Data, are you
all right?

582
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,750
Yes, sir.

583
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:15,834
We will be returning

584
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,375
to the beam-out
point shortly.

585
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:20,875
That's it. Let's go.

586
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,625
(<i> gasps</i> )

587
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,917
Can we transport without
the pattern enhancers?

588
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,125
No. We are too far
below the surface.

589
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:45,750
How are we going
to get down there?

590
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,083
There are no handholds
in the rock face.

591
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,333
(<i> gasping cry</i> )

592
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,834
We are going
to have to jump.

593
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:56,458
No. It's too far,
I won't make it.

594
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,583
You will.

595
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:23,375
LA FORGE:
Basically, she's
a Soong-type android

596
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:24,792
except everything about her

597
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:27,000
is designed to fool you
into thinking she's human.

598
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:35,709
She has tear ducts,
sweat glands

599
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,041
even veins and capillaries
underneath her skin.

600
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,417
Why does the scanner
read her as human?

601
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,250
Because she has
a feedback processor

602
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,959
designed to send out
a false bio-signal.

603
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,875
It's part of her
aging program.

604
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:50,709
Not only does she age
in appearance like Data

605
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,542
her vital signs change, too.

606
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,458
What I can't
figure out

607
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,750
is why she lost
consciousness.

608
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,917
As far as I can see,
everything is fine.

609
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:01,375
She should be awake.

610
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,500
Check her
positronic matrix.

611
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,041
There may be a cascade
anomaly.

612
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,250
You said you knew
she was an android. How?

613
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,750
The first indication occurred
when we were digging.

614
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,750
I saw her perform
complex calculations

615
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:18,041
without the assistance
of the computer.

616
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,834
That could have just meant
she was good at math.

617
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,458
That is true.

618
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,333
But it was enough
to get my attention.

619
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,417
Later, I noticed
something odd

620
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,333
about the way she
blinked her eyes.

621
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,000
The intervals
between blinks

622
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,041
were governed by
the Fourier system--

623
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,542
the same mathematical
formula my father used

624
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:36,375
to give my blinking pattern
the appearance of randomness.

625
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:39,125
Only<i> you</i> could have noticed
something like that.

626
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,750
Then there was the
concert in Ten-Forward.

627
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,291
What about it?

628
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,542
We had practiced the
piece, and I noticed

629
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,917
she played it the same way
during the performance--

630
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:52,333
every pitch, every intonation
was exactly the same.

631
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,291
Only an artificial life-form
could have done that.

632
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:58,333
Does her husband
know anything about this?

633
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:00,208
I do not
believe so.

634
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,375
He is on the surface

635
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:03,291
monitoring
the plasma infusion.

636
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,125
Probably just as well.

637
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,333
LA FORGE:
Data, come take
a look at this.

638
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:14,625
It appears to be an
information module.

639
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,750
With a holographic
interface.

640
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,000
(<i> clicking</i> )

641
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:42,041
Whoever you are

642
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,667
you must have found out
about Juliana.

643
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,291
That is correct.

644
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,000
I programmed this hologram

645
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:50,166
to answer any questions
you might have.

646
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,125
I am Noonien Soong.

647
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,333
I created her.

648
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,333
I am Data.

649
00:34:58,375 --> 00:34:59,583
Data?

650
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,250
I hoped somehow
it would be you.

651
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:13,750
I even created
a response program

652
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,291
to answer<i> your</i> questions.

653
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,417
How are you, boy?

654
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:27,041
I am fine.

655
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,250
I'm glad you got the chance
to meet your mother.

656
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,458
You refer to Dr. Tainer
as my mother

657
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,834
yet the complexity
of her design indicates

658
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,667
she was created<i> after</i> I was.

659
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,583
You're right.

660
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:44,166
But...

661
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,208
there was a real
Juliana O'Donnell.

662
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,208
She was my wife.

663
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,917
She helped me
create you.

664
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:58,750
What happened to her?

665
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:05,542
She was... injured

666
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,083
when the Crystalline
Entity attacked.

667
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,917
We made it as far
as Terlina III

668
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:14,083
but...

669
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,208
she slipped into
a coma.

670
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:21,291
When I realized

671
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:24,792
nothing could be done for her,
I built an android.

672
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,500
I tried to...

673
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:32,625
perfect my synaptic
scanning technique

674
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:35,792
so that I could transfer
Juliana's memories

675
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:38,083
into a positronic matrix.

676
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,000
Didn't know
if it would work

677
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:41,166
but I had to try.

678
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:45,458
I couldn't
stand the thought

679
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,375
of losing the only woman
I ever loved.

680
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,834
A few days
after Juliana died,

681
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,375
I activated the android.

682
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,625
She looked up
at me...

683
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:03,417
and smiled.

684
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,291
She recognized me.

685
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:08,583
It had worked!

686
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,875
Here was a life
not two minutes old

687
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:14,417
and as far as she
was concerned,

688
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,291
I was her husband.

689
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:19,375
She'd just recovered
from a terrible injury.

690
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:20,792
It was incredible.

691
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,834
Then you never
told her the truth?

692
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,417
Why?

693
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,000
There was no reason
for her to know.

694
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,375
I wanted
her to be happy.

695
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,875
I wanted<i> us</i> to be happy.

696
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,542
And we were...

697
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,875
(<i> sighs</i> )

698
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:45,417
...for awhile.

699
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,583
What happened?

700
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,542
I made
a terrible mistake.

701
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,166
I never really...

702
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,500
let her know
how much I loved her.

703
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:06,583
So she left me.

704
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:12,083
The real Juliana
would have left, too

705
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,625
if she had lived.

706
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,959
If she recovers

707
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,709
and learns that
she is an android...

708
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,291
She doesn't
have to know.

709
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:22,291
Now, I designed her
to shut down

710
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,041
in the event that
the truth was discovered.

711
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:28,375
When you... when you
put that chip back in

712
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:30,792
she will wake up
and remember nothing.

713
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:33,583
All you have to do is
make up some excuse

714
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:34,917
about what
happened to her.

715
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:40,083
Then you do not believe
she should know the truth?

716
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,333
The truth.

717
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,667
The truth is

718
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:49,125
in every way
that matters

719
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:51,500
she<i> is</i> Juliana Soong.

720
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,917
I programmed her
to terminate

721
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,417
after a long life.

722
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:03,000
Let her
live out her days

723
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,333
and die believing
she was human.

724
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:09,750
Don't rob her
of that, son...

725
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:12,959
please.

726
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:17,208
It seems that
I must make a decision--

727
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,375
whether to tell Dr. Tainer
that she is an android

728
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:22,625
or to withhold that
information from her.

729
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,917
I do not know
what to do.

730
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:30,709
Why was Dr. Soong so adamant
that she not be told?

731
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,333
He seemed certain
that if she knew

732
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:34,875
it would preclude the
possibility of her being happy.

733
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,667
Data,
what do<i> you</i> think?

734
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,333
I am not certain.

735
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:41,625
I understand why my father
felt as he did

736
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:45,250
but his wishes are not
necessarily paramount.

737
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:48,417
I am more concerned
with what would
be best for her.

738
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:51,250
Wouldn't she be
better off knowing the truth

739
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,583
dealing with the reality
of her existence?

740
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,625
I don't think so.

741
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:58,333
She's believed
she's human all her life.

742
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,417
The truth might be
devastating to her.

743
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:04,000
Data, there might come
some time in the future

744
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,542
when she would
find out anyway--

745
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:06,750
another accident,
perhaps.

746
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:09,375
Maybe it would be
easier for her

747
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:10,875
if she learned
the truth from you.

748
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:15,875
I can tell you
that if I were in her place

749
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:20,250
I would rather be told by my
son than by some stranger.

750
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:25,875
I find I am having
difficulty separating

751
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:30,417
what would be best for her

752
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,291
from what
would be best for me.

753
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:34,667
What do you mean?

754
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:37,625
If she knew she were
an android

755
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,125
we would have
something to share.

756
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,959
I would no longer be alone
in the universe.

757
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:51,417
I know how much
that means to you, Data

758
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:56,208
but at the same time,
by telling her

759
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,125
you're robbing
her of the one thing

760
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:00,500
you've wanted all
your life--

761
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,583
to be human.

762
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,291
It's a difficult choice.

763
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,959
You must do what
you think best, Data.

764
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,250
But whatever decision
you make,

765
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:13,542
we will support it.

766
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,333
Data.

767
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:45,417
What happened?

768
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:49,250
The last thing I remember
was jumping off a cliff.

769
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,875
You were knocked
unconscious by the fall.

770
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,583
You broke
a bone in your arm

771
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,291
but Dr. Crusher
repaired it.

772
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:05,583
Everything is fine.

773
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:12,709
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

774
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,375
<i>The infusion of plasma</i>
<i>into the core of Atrea IV</i>

775
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,125
<i>has been accomplished.</i>

776
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:20,542
<i>The core should remain molten</i>
<i>for several hundred years.</i>

777
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:22,667
When will I
see you again?

778
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:25,250
Perhaps I can visit
Atrea on my next leave.

779
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:28,375
I would like
that very much.

780
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:33,792
Well, I'd better
be going.

781
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,291
There is something
I think you should know.

782
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:40,625
My father told me...

783
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:48,125
that he had only one
great love in his life

784
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:49,750
and that he regretted
never telling her

785
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:51,250
how much
he cared for her.

786
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:56,375
I am certain he was
referring to you.

787
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:04,000
That's nice to know.

788
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:10,917
On Atrea,
there is a saying

789
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:12,542
that a child born

790
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:15,041
from parents who
love each other

791
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:17,250
will have nothing
but goodness in his heart.

792
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,083
I guess that explains you.

793
00:43:44,834 --> 00:43:46,291
Take care of
yourself, son.

794
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,125
Good-bye... Mother.

795
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:52,875
Energize.
