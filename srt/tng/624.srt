<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46915.2.</i>

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,625
<i>The</i> Enterprise
<i>is orbiting Nervala IV</i>

00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:10,709
<i>waiting for an opportunity</i>

00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,125
<i>left there</i>

00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,041

(<i> jazz combo playing</i>
<i>"I Remember You"</i> )

7
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,709
Thank you.

8
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,959
Thank you very much.

9
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,041
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

10
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,500
Any requests tonight?

11
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:08,625
"Night Bird."

12
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,333
Any requests?

13
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,709
"Night Bird."

14
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,291
Ladies and gentlemen

15
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,417
"Night Bird."

16
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:20,542
One, two, three...

17
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,166
(<i> up-tempo jazz intro</i> )

18
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,917
What was that all about?

19
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,583
Will's been trying
to get this piece right

20
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,959
for ten years.

21
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,000
He's never made it
through the solo.

22
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:45,500
Here it comes.

23
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,583
Data to Commander Riker.

24
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,834
Go ahead.

25
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,041
Commander,
you are needed on the bridge.

26
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,166
On my way.

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,583
Saved by the bell.

28
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,375
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Data?

29
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:14,959
Yes, sir. It appears
we will be able

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,291
to transport
to the surface

31
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,583
sooner than
anticipated.

32
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,875
Is the planet's
distortion field

33
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:20,500
re-phasing sooner
than you predicted?

34
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:23,375
No, sir. Using
the<i> Potemkin's</i> transport logs

35
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:25,709
from the original evacuation,
Commander La Forge and I

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,250
were able
to modify the transporters.

37
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,250
So we can beam out through
a higher distortion field.

38
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,291
The transporters are
considerably more efficient

39
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,500
than those used on
the<i> Potemkin</i> eight years ago.

40
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,417
It's a good thing.

41
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,917
I almost didn't make it off
the surface.

42
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,458
When can we
get started?

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,917
97 minutes, sir.

44
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,625
How long will
the transport window be open?

45
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,083
26 minutes.

46
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,458
After that, the distortion
field will re-phase.

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,041
That doesn't give us much time
to retrieve the database.

48
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,875
The planet's proximity
to its sun will create

49
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,583
two additional
transport windows

50
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,291
in the next three days.

51
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,750
Let's hope
that's enough.

52
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,083
It will have
to be, sir.

53
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,166
The next transport window
will not occur

54
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,709
for another eight years

55
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,417
when the planet's orbit
will bring it close enough

56
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,959
to the sun to de-phase
the distortion field.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,083
Okay, notify the away team

58
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,667
we'll be going in
ahead of schedule.

59
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:09,875
I'll tell the captain.
Aye, sir.

60
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,125
(<i> beeping</i> )

61
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,750
This is different
than I remember.

62
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,875
This place was a mess
when we left.

63
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:34,000
Commander...

64
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,625
RIKER:
Someone was here.

65
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:40,917
A ship could
have been caught

66
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,875
in the distortion field
and crashed.

67
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:45,250
The survivors may have
taken refuge here.

68
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,041
Commander,
someone is approaching.

69
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,417
Humanoid.

70
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,208
40 meters due east
and closing.

71
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,333
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

72
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,125
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

73
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:49,917
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

74
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:53,500
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

75
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:58,041
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

76
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,834
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

77
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,333
Who are you?

78
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,000
Who are<i> you?</i>

79
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,625
I'm Commander
William Riker

80
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,583
from the federation
starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

81
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,834
That's not possible.

82
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,333
<i>I'm</i> Will Riker.

83
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:26,834
May I ask
how you got here?

84
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,667
Eight years ago, I led a team
to evacuate this station.

85
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,208
What ship were you on?

86
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,458
The<i> Potemkin.</i>

87
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,917
Why did you not return
to the<i> Potemkin</i>

88
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,208
with the others?

89
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,291
I was the last one out.

90
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,500
The distortion field

91
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:47,083
must have interfered
with the transport.

92
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,875
They lost
the signal lock on me.

93
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,667
When I tried
to contact the ship

94
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,291
I couldn't get through
the interference.

95
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,041
If you check with Starfleet

96
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,500
I'm sure they recorded
that I was lost on that day.

97
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,291
That's not
what happened.

98
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,542
I was the last one out

99
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,375
and I made it back
to the<i> Potemkin.</i>

100
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:05,709
You don't believe me?

101
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,583
It's not that
we don't believe you.

102
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,667
It's just hard to see how
both stories could be true.

103
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,834
Would you be willing to have
our doctor check you out?

104
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,041
Of course.

105
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,917
Mr. Worf, take him directly
to sick bay, and notify

106
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,250
the captain
once you're on board.

107
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,375
Let's get to work.

108
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,625
Worf to<i> Enterprise.</i>

109
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,125
Two to beam up.

110
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,291
Aye, sir. Stand by.

111
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,625
It looks like you
fractured your arm
a few years ago.

112
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,333
I was doing some repairs
under the station

113
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,917
when an earthquake hit.

114
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,625
Got caught
in a rock slide.

115
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,000
I had to set it myself.

116
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,375
Jean-Luc Picard.

117
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,208
Lieutenant Will Riker.

118
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,875
I hope you understand I'll
need to verify your claim.

119
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,709
Yes, sir.
CRUSHER:
Genetically

120
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,959
he is indistinguishable
from Commander Riker.

121
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,000
Could there be some sort
of cloning involved here?

122
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,041
I don't think so.

123
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,750
There's
no genetic drift.

124
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,250
But it's not conclusive.

125
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,458
That's why I compared
their brain scans.

126
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,875
Brain organization
patterns

127
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:31,500
are as unique
as fingerprints.

128
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,166
Except for minor,
minor differences

129
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,959
theirs are identical.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,375
But can't brain patterns
be cloned?

131
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,834
No. They're determined
by experience--

132
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,417
mostly from
early childhood.

133
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,792
How can two grown men

134
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,542
share the same childhood
experiences?

135
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,667
It just doesn't
make any sense.

136
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:50,291
I am Will Riker.

137
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,792
I don't know
who or what made it back

138
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,959
to the<i> Potemkin</i> that day,
but it wasn't me.

139
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,458
Lieutenant, our
chief engineer is checking

140
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,709
the transporter logs
of the<i> Potemkin.</i>

141
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,583
Perhaps that will shed
some light on the matter.

142
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,750
Don't worry.

143
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,125
We will get
to the bottom of this,

144
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,417
and in the meantime

145
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,375
you'll be taken
to your quarters.

146
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,625
Try and make yourself
as comfortable as possible.

147
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:13,959
I will.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,083
The replicators
on the station

149
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,625
haven't worked
for a long time.

150
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:17,917
It's been a while
since I've had a decent meal.

151
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,166
Doctor.

152
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,166
Apparently, there was
a massive energy surge

153
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,834
in the distortion field
around the planet

154
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,041
just at the moment
you tried to beam out.

155
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,792
The transporter chief
tried to compensate

156
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,041
by initiating
a second containment beam.

157
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,875
Hmm, an interesting
approach.

158
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:42,166
He must have
been planning

159
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,208
to reintegrate
the two patterns

160
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,625
in the transport
buffer.

161
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,834
Actually, it wasn't
really necessary.

162
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,709
Commander Riker's pattern
maintained its integrity

163
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,083
with just
the one containment beam.

164
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,709
He made it back to the ship
just fine.

165
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,041
What happened
to the second beam?

166
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,667
The transporter chief
shut it down

167
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:00,709
but somehow, it was reflected
back to the surface.

168
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,583
And another William Riker
materialized there.

169
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,917
How was the
second pattern

170
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,000
able to maintain
its integrity?

171
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,291
The containment beam
must have had

172
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,959
the exact same
phase differential

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,750
as the distortion field.

174
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,417
Which of them is real?

175
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,750
LA FORGE:
Well, that's the thing. Both.

176
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,500
You were both materialized
from a complete pattern.

177
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:21,834
CRUSHER:
Up until
that moment

178
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,625
you were the same person.

179
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,208
PICARD:
But, of course, as you

180
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,291
and Lieutenant Riker
have lived

181
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,917
very different lives
for the past eight years

182
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,375
you are now
very different people.

183
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,542
I suppose
it's a little like

184
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,083
meeting someone's twin.

185
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:40,834
But no matter how strange
it may seem to us, we now have

186
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,792
two Will Rikers
on board, and as
Lieutenant Riker

187
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,333
will be with us
for several days

188
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,709
I think we should
do everything we
can to make him

189
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,792
comfortable and welcome.

190
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,041
RIKER:
We still have
the problem

191
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,834
of retrieving
the database.

192
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,250
The computer on the station's
not completely operational.

193
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,583
DATA:
Many of
its components

194
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,166
have been removed.

195
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,667
Apparently,
Lieutenant Riker used them

196
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,500
to keep the station's
radiation shield operational.

197
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,000
Can it be repaired

198
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,000
at least enough
to access the database?

199
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,834
Without knowing what he did,
that'll be tough.

200
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,208
Perhaps he can help us.

201
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,417
He was alone down there
for a long time.

202
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,166
I'm hesitant
to let him go back

203
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,250
until he's been
evaluated.

204
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,458
I'll talk to him.

205
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,083
Thank you, Counselor.

206
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:33,750
(<i> door chimes</i> )

207
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,041
Come in.

208
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,375
(<i> door opens</i> )

209
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,291
TROI:
Hello, Will.

210
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,291
Ah...

211
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,166
<i>Imzadi...</i>

212
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,250
Will...

213
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,709
I never thought
I'd see you again.

214
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:00,792
We need to talk.

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,375
You're on board
because of him.

216
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:05,625
No.

217
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:08,041
Commander Riker and I
are friends...

218
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,792
close friends
but nothing more.

219
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,875
Why don't we sit down.

220
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,417
Do you remember
the last time

221
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,542
we saw each other?

222
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,250
Like yesterday.

223
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,917
The Janaran Falls
on Betazed.

224
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,583
It was the day before

225
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,583
you started your tour
on the<i> Potemkin.</i>

226
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,959
And we were going
to meet on Risa

227
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,291
six weeks later.

228
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,458
We never did.

229
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,000
I know.
No...

230
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,750
what I mean is...

231
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,458
Commander Riker
and I never did.

232
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,625
You see, he earned
a promotion very quickly.

233
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,750
I know that, too.

234
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,166
"For exceptional valor

235
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,166
"during the evacuation
of the research station

236
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,250
on Nervala IV."

237
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,291
I've been looking
at his service record.

238
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,959
He chose to make
his career a priority.

239
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,875
There wasn't much time
for anything else.

240
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,542
We kept in touch,
but we didn't

241
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,542
see each other again

242
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,959
until we were
both posted

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,709
to the<i> Enterprise</i> 
two years later.

244
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,125
By then, our feelings
for each other had changed.

245
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,834
We've served together
for six years...

246
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
but things never went back
to the way they used to be.

247
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,250
I had a lot of time
on my hands

248
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,583
when I was down
on that station.

249
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,542
There were days
that I was so lonely

250
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,083
I thought I might
lose my mind.

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,208
Do you know
how I made it through?

252
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,458
I thought if I hung on

253
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,250
for one more day,
they'd rescue me

254
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,500
and maybe
I'd see you again.

255
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,875
I guess things
don't always work out

256
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,166
the way you expect
them to.

257
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,709
I know this isn't
what you were hoping for

258
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,041
but that doesn't mean

259
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,291
you can't make a future
for yourself.

260
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,458
Thanks.

261
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,041
Captain Picard
wanted me to find out

262
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,458
if you'd be willing

263
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
to help us retrieve
the station's database.

264
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,500
I reconfigured that computer
so many times

265
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,959
they probably can't
make head or tails of it.

266
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,208
I'd be happy to help.

267
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,917
Do you feel
up to it?

268
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,542
Absolutely.

269
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,208
Good. I'll tell
the captain.

270
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,166
Well...

271
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,291
I have to go.

272
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,250
Deanna...

273
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,792
I know it's been a long time
since we've been together

274
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,959
and I know your feelings
have changed.

275
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,458
Mine haven't.

276
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,959
I can't just give up.

277
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:11,875
I'd like to be
with you again.

278
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:17,917
Good night, Will.

279
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,875
Phase distortion is dropping.

280
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,542
The next transport window
opens in 42 seconds.

281
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,834
How long will we have,
Lieutenant?

282
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,291
36 minutes, sir.

283
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,667
We are losing time.
Lieutenant Riker should be here.

284
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,792
Computer,
locate Lieutenant...

285
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,000
Cancel inquiry.

286
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,709
You were supposed to report here
at 0800 hours.

287
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,250
I'm sorry. I was...
I guess it's been a while

288
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,083
since you've had
to punch a clock.

289
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,291
Let's go.

290
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,458
Energize.

291
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,542
I shut down most
of the consoles
to save power.

292
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,291
I rerouted just
about everything
through here.

293
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,834
Check out
the primary EPS system.

294
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,542
See if you can get some power
to the rest of these consoles.

295
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:27,583
I shunted the database

296
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,458
to the main core
underneath the station.

297
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,625
Can we access it
from here?

298
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:31,667
Well, there's been a lot of

299
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:33,291
seismic activity
over the years.

300
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,083
If the servo-links were
damaged, we may not
be able to.

301
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:39,083
I'll try to tap
into the command pathways.

302
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,417
You see if you can access
and disable the file server.

303
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,000
(<i> beeping</i> )

304
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,208
You know,
I've been thinking

305
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,291
we should probably let Dad
know what happened.

306
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,458
I'm sure
he'd be thrilled

307
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,250
to know there are
two of us now.

308
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,709
Actually, he and I have been
able to patch a few things up.

309
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,041
Well, I've been
able to get by

310
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,166
for a long time
without seeing him.

311
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,834
I'm not about to
start now.

312
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,500
What made you
contact him?

313
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,000
I didn't.

314
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,333
He came on board
the<i> Enterprise</i>

315
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,500
to brief me
when I was offered the<i> Aries.</i>

316
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:21,834
What did he say when you
turned down your own command?

317
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,917
He couldn't understand
why I did it.

318
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,417
For once, he and I
agree on something.

319
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,625
The primary EPS coupling
is fused.

320
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,333
The entire unit will
have to be replaced.

321
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,000
I've accessed
the command pathways.

322
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,583
The interlink relays
are functioning now.

323
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,917
Let's see if
that did the trick.

324
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,458
(<i> beeping</i> )

325
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,667
No. It's not working.

326
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,792
The servo-link
must be damaged.

327
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,208
We're going to have to go
under the station--

328
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,583
access the core directly.

329
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,709
We have less than
three minutes left.

330
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,417
Well, I'll stay here.

331
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,500
I'll be finished by the time
the third window opens.

332
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:01,834
It's too dangerous.

333
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,166
Our scans show the caverns
are unstable.

334
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,375
I've been down there
dozens of times.

335
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,458
I know my way around.

336
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,583
We'll come back during
the third window.

337
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,375
We'll bring a
new EPS coupling.

338
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,875
We'll try to access the core
from another console up here.

339
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,458
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i> 
La Forge here.

340
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,583
We're ready
to beam out.

341
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,917
You go ahead.

342
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,583
I'll be finished
by the time you get back.

343
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,834
Hold it!

344
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,208
I gave you an order,
Lieutenant!

345
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,041
Computer.

346
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,750
Valerian root tea, hot.

00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:03,291
"Meet me in transporter
room three at 1900 hours.

348
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,417
It's important."

349
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,000
"It pulses unendingly

351
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:58,917
Can I help you,
Counselor?

352
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,125
No, thank you.

353
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,875
"What the future holds
no one can know

354

355
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,208
Hmm.

356
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,125
Janaran Falls.

357
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,375
I remember.

358
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,542
Where did you
get this?

359
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,333
I made it a couple
of years ago

360
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,959
down on the station.

361
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,333
You made this?

362
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,625
Well, you should have seen
the first two.

363
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,291
It took a while
to get a fine enough beam

364
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,208
out of the phaser.

365
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,291
Oh, it's lovely.
Thank you.

366
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:15,709
Can you stay
and talk for a while?

367
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,834
Mm-hmm.

368
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,208
I wanted to remember
our last night together.

369
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,542
So, um...
how does it feel

370
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,834
being with people again?

371
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:37,917
Great.

372
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,709
Strange.

373
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,959
For a long time

374
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,041
I did whatever I wanted
whenever I wanted.

375
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:49,959
It's been hard getting used
to taking orders again.

376
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,625
I can imagine.

377
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,083
But I guess I'll have
to get used to it

378
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,250
if I want to get
my career going again.

379
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,250
Is that what
you've decided to do?

380
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,625
Remember, I'm the one

381
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,458
who wanted to make captain
by the time he was 35.

382
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,750
I'm a little
behind schedule.

383
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,041
I'll admit that.

384
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,709
It's good you don't
feel set back.

385
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,083
I do.

386
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,792
Things are
a little more complicated

387
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,959
than I had planned...

388
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,458
but there's nothing
going to stand in the way

389
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,917
of my getting
what I want.

390
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,500
There you go.

391
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,208
Thanks.

392
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:34,458
You don't know how many times
I thought about you...

393
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,083
about us.

394
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,875
For weeks
after the evacuation

395
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,458
I kept thinking
they'd find a way

396
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,667
through the distortion field
and come back for me.

397
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:46,333
I even thought...

398
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,291
we'd meet on Risa
like we planned.

399
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,667
But days went by

400
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:55,250
and nobody came,
and then I realized why.

401
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,709
They thought
that I had been killed

402
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,875
in the beam-out.

403
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:01,208
No one came down
because they thought

404
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,041
there was no one
to come down for.

405
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:10,083
So I figured that they'd had
a memorial service for me.

406
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,041
Somehow that made me
feel better.

407
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,375
I can understand that.

408
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,667
You were there.

409
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:20,375
All dressed in black.

410
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,166
Very flattering on you
by the way.

411
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,417
I'm sure I looked terrible

412
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,959
with my eyes all red
and swollen from crying.

413
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,333
Sometimes...

414
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,834
I would look up
into the sky and I'd think

415
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,458
if I tried hard enough

416
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,250
I could make you
feel my presence

417
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,417
that if I could let you know
that I was alive

418
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,834
maybe you'd
wait for me.

419
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,750
I know it-it sounds...
crazy

420
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,750
but there were times
when I could have sw...

421
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:58,583
What am I talking about?

422
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,500
The other day
when I told you

423
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:09,291
about how Commander Riker
and I

424
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,625
didn't meet
on Risa...

425
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,917
what I didn't say was
how disappointed I was.

426
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,959
You didn't have to.

427
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,083
I knew.

428
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I started to hear from
him less and less.

429
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,875
I knew his career was taking
him away from me, but...

430
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:34,542
I didn't want
to believe it was over.

431
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:44,166
I spent a lot of time
thinking about him...

432
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,458
wondering where he was,
what he was doing.

433
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:50,500
Sometimes I'd look
into the sky

434
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:52,625
and imagine
that he knew...

435
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,625
and that somehow

436
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:00,041
he could sense me
thinking about him.

437
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,000
So, who knows?

438
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,667
Maybe one night

439
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:11,917
we were looking up
at the same star, and...

440
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,542
you were thinking
about me.

441
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:20,208
And in a way...

442
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,792
I was thinking
about you.

443
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
(<i> door chiming</i> )

444
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,125
Come.

445
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,250
You wanted to
see me, sir?

446
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:40,667
Yes, Number One.
Come in.

447
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:42,709
Lieutenant Riker
has been to see me

448
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,166
to talk about
the away mission.

449
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,792
He believes that
the only way

450
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,125
to retrieve
the database

451
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,500
is by directly accessing
the main core

452
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:52,500
underneath
the station.

453
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:55,542
The seismic activity makes
those caverns very unstable.

454
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,166
In my opinion,
it's too risky.

455
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,583
He said that he was
down there recently.

456
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,208
He seemed confident that
it could be done safely.

457
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,417
There's a good chance

458
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,792
we will be able
to retrieve the database

459
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:06,417
from one of the consoles
inside the station.

460
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,583
But if it doesn't work

461
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:11,458
we won't have another chance
for eight years.

462
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,166
Lieutenant Riker's plan
is more dangerous

463
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,917
but it does have
a better chance of succeeding.

464
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,291
Given the importance
of the data

465
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,750
I think that
it's worth the risk.

466
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,166
I'll look over
the schematics

467
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,834
and I'll draw up
a mission plan.

468
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,792
I'm sure that
Lieutenant Riker
will be happy

469
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,333
to help you with that.

470
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,792
I'll talk to him.

471
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,667
(<i> sighs softly</i> )

472
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,166
Sir.

473
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,417
Lieutenant.

474
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,375
Sir.

475
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:55,583
I just met
with the captain

476
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,041
about your mission
recommendation.

477
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,250
I would appreciate it

478
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:00,500
if next time
you came to me first.

479
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,125
I tried talking
to you yesterday
on the station.

480
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,458
You wouldn't hear me out.

481
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,333
I heard you, Lieutenant.
I rejected your plan.

482
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,458
May I ask
what the captain decided?

483
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,917
The captain has decided to go
with your recommendation

484
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:15,375
but that's
not the point.

485
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:16,542
Isn't it?

486
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,166
If you think I'm
coming down on you

487
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,583
because the captain
overruled me

488
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,375
think again.

489
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,333
I happen to disagree
with his decision

490
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,166
but he is my
commanding officer

491
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:27,500
and I follow his orders.

492
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,709
Just so there's
no confusion

493
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,125
I am<i> your</i> commanding officer

494
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:34,125
and I expect
you to do the same.

495
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,333
If you can't

496
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,959
there's no place for you
on my away team.

497
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,375
Yes, sir.

498
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:41,875
There will be a meeting
in the observation lounge

499
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:44,125
at 1400 hours
to draw up a
mission plan.

500
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:57,458
We stayed in ten-forward
talking for hours.

501
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,709
Then what happened?

502
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,750
He walked me
to my quarters.

503
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,208
Then what happened?

504
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,417
Beverly.

505
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,583
I'm just asking.

506
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,458
You know it's been over
between Will and me

507
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,542
for a long time.

508
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,291
He's not Will.

509
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,375
He is Will, but...

510
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,834
you know what I mean.

511
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,625
It's really hard for me

512
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,792
to separate
my feelings for them.

513
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:22,417
Deanna, just because things
turned out the way they did

514
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,959
between you
and<i> Commander</i> Riker

515
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,375
doesn't mean you
shouldn't let things

516
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,208
between you
and<i> Lieutenant</i> Riker

517
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,458
take their own course.

518
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,083
I knew you'd
encourage me.

519
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,542
Well, I thought that's
why you brought it up.

520
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

521
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,417
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

522
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,000
Well, I think
I'll call it a day.

523
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,583
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Beverly...

524
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:56,750
Bye.

525
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:04,208
Some form of
Tai Chi Chuan?

526
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,375
Klingon exercises,
actually.

527
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:09,834
Lieutenant Worf
teaches a class.

528
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:10,917
Forms are very
similar.

529
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,083
Do that move again.

530
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:32,458
You just did
the<i> KoH-man-ara.</i>

531
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,458
In Tai Chi Chuan

532
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,875
it's called
the crane block.

533
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,041
Now, let's try
something else.

534
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:45,125
What is that called?

535
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,917
Mr. Worf's
a very good teacher.

536
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,375
Hello, Will.

537
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,542
If you want to be with him

538
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:15,917
you don't have to ask
my permission.

539
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,834
The look in your eyes--
I recognize it.

540
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,542
You used to
have it for me.

541
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:37,375
We've both had relationships
with other people

542
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:38,542
but this is different.

543
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,750
I didn't know
how you'd feel about it.

544
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:42,625
Flattered...
sort of.

545
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,875
This must be
very strange for you.

546
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:50,500
Ever since
he came on board

547
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:52,166
I find myself thinking
about the choice

548
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:53,500
that you and I made.

549
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,083
Me, too.

550
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,625
Do me a favor.

551
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,500
Be careful.

552
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:06,792
Will, I know you and he
have had some problems.

553
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:08,333
That's not
what I'm talking about.

554
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:14,417
If he had gotten
off the planet instead of me

555
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,458
don't you think he would
have made the same choices

556
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,542
that I made?

557
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:22,375
I just don't want you
to be hurt again.

558
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:33,959
Two pair.

559
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,375

561
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,125
I'd like to thank you both

562
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,959

contributions.

I thought you'd be alone.
Excuse me.

566
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:01,667
Why don't you join us.

Three, please.

571
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,250
Mr. Worf?

572
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:35,458
Four.

573
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,625
Commander?

574
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,000
I'll play these.

575
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:49,333
Dealer takes two.

576
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,125
You control the bet,
Lieutenant.

577
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,542
Fifty.
Fold.

578
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,417
Here's your
50 and ten more.

579
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:02,875
You didn't take
any cards.

580
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:04,125
You must be
holding something.

581
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:05,959
Why not make it
a little sweeter?

582
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,375
No, thanks.

583
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:08,750
Playing it safe?

584
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,709
You in?

585
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:14,000
I will call.

586
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:19,875
Here's your ten

587
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,959
and it'll cost you
another 100.

588
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:29,041
I practiced in
the mirror too long

589
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,166
to be fooled by
that face.

590
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,959
You're bluffing.

591
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,250
Here's your hundred

592
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,834
and 20 more.

593
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:40,083
Dealer folds.

594
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:44,625
I thought if one thing
were clear by now

595
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,750
it's that you and I play
things a little differently.

596
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,458
Why don't we wait and see
who comes out on top.

597
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:50,667
I thought you were
willing to settle

598
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:52,291
for second, Commander.

599
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,834
I've never settled
for anything in my life.

600
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,291
I know
what I want--

601
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,750
I know what I've got--

602
00:33:57,792 --> 00:34:00,208
and you'd be lucky to do
so well, Lieutenant.

603
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,417
Here's your 20.

604
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,625
300 more.

605
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,875
Now I know
you're bluffing.

606
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:16,875
Are you in or not?

607
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:18,792
Why don't we
get this over with.

608
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:20,375
I'll call your three

609
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:22,000
and I'll raise you anything
you've got left.

610
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,458
Well?

611
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:31,709
Take it.

612
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,041
You always had
the better hand...

613
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,166
in everything.

Hi.

619
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,208
I'm sorry to just stop by
like this

620
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,750
but there's something I'd
like to talk to you about.

621
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,417
Captain Picard has
made some inquiries

622
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:10,291
and he managed to
get me a posting
on the<i> Gandhi</i>

623
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:12,625
and considering how long
I've been out of commission

624
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:15,000
it's an amazing
opportunity.

625
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:17,000
When would you leave?

626
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:19,458
In about a week.

627
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,542
I see.

628
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,250
Deanna...

629
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,917
after I've served
for six months

630
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,709
I'm eligible to bring
family aboard.

631
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,125
If we got married...

632
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,583
You said those
exact words to me

633
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,875
before you went to serve
on the<i> Potemkin.</i>

634
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,208
I know.

635
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,959
I was just
held up for a while.

636
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,792
But if you hadn't been

637
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,709
what would have happened
between us?

638
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,500
I wouldn't have made
the mistake of leaving you.

639
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:50,000
I know that much.

640
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,625
I don't know
if I can believe that.

641
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,625
(<i> sighing</i> )

642
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,417
It took me a long time

643
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:02,834
to get over what happened
between Commander Riker and me.

644
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,959
I don't know
that I want to put myself

645
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,875
in that position again.

646
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,083
I would never
hurt you, Deanna.

647
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,875
It's not just that.

648
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:13,333
I've worked hard to make
a life for myself

649
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:15,208
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

650
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,625
I'm happy here.

651
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:19,625
If the situation were
different, I'd stay

652
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,083
but I can't...

653
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:25,667
not while he's aboard.

654
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,250
I know.

655
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,208
Are you saying
it's over?

656
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,667
No.

657
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:36,709
No.

658
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,250
I just don't know

659
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,291
if I'm ready to give up
my life here.

660
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,375
Maybe we both
need some time.

you can shunt the database

You're with me,

670

I thought
Commander Data's expertise...

It doesn't take that
much expertise to
repair a servo-link.

You and I
can handle it.

673
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,667
Lieutenant, I am curious
about something.

674
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,625
If you met a double
of yourself

675
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:44,542
would you have difficulty
interacting with him?

676
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:48,208
I think so.

677
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,333
Why?

678
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:54,125
I am not easy
to get along with.

679
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,750
Hmm.

680
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:58,709
But Commander Riker
and Lieutenant Riker are

681
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,125
yet they seem to have
trouble

682
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:02,417
getting along
with each other.

683
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:06,583
I have found that humans
value their uniqueness--

684
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:08,208
that sense that
they are different

685
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,250
from everyone else.

686
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:13,417
The existence of a double
would preclude that feeling.

687
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,083
Could that be the source
of the friction?

688
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,417
Well, perhaps
it is more a matter

689
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:20,709
of seeing something
in your double--

690
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,417
something you
do not like in yourself.

691
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:35,792
This is it.

692
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,125

know the best way.

00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,333
Climb!

717
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,583
Come on!

718
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:39,917
I'm being pulled in.

719
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,083
Let go!

720
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,041
One of us has
to get out of here!

721
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:45,041
Climb!

722
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,166
Come on!

723
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,166
Climb!

724
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,375
Climb!

725
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:54,041
(<i> grunting</i> )

726
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:03,375
(<i> both grunting and panting</i> )

727
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
(<i> sighing</i> )

728
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,375
(<i> beeping</i> )

729
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:38,875
They have restored
the servo-link to the core.

730
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:40,750
We can begin downloading
the database.

731
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:42,041
Initiating data transfer.

732
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:50,291
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46920.1.</i>

733
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:53,166
<i>We have retrieved the database</i>
<i>from Nervala station</i>

734
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,709
<i>and are headed for our</i>
<i>rendezvous with the Gandhi.</i>

735
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,333
(<i> door chimes</i> )

736
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,458
Come in.

737
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,208
I hear the<i> Gandhi's</i> going
on a terraforming mission

738
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,250
to the Lagana sector.

739
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:13,583
That's right.

740
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:15,041
It'll take us four months
just to get there.

741
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,291
I won't be joining you.

742
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,959
I guess I'm not surprised
to hear that.

743
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm just not ready
to give up my life here.

744
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:29,709
Not yet.

745
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,792
(<i> door chimes</i> )

746
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:37,208
Come in.

747
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:40,750
I'm sorry.

748
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,000
It's all right.

749
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:44,542
I wanted to give you something.

750
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:52,083
My quarters are
full of things

751
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,542
that I suppose
belong to both of us.

752
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:56,083
The least I could do
was give you this.

753
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,125
Thanks.

754
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:02,125
Good luck, Will.

755
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,750
I actually thought I might
go with the name Thomas.

756
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:05,875
Your middle name.

757
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:10,291
I guess we really
are different.

758
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,208
I never really
cared for that name.

759
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,083
Well, I sort of like it.

760
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,333
I guess
I better get going.

761
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,333
I waited a long time.

762
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:34,834
I guess I can wait
a little longer.

763
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,041
Take care of her.
