PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log:</i>
<i>Stardate 44995.3.</i>

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:07,875
<i>We are en route</i>
<i>to the Klingon home world</i>

3
00:00:07,917 --> 00:00:10,208
<i>where I will participate</i>
<i>in the installation ceremony</i>

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,959
<i>of Gowron, the next designated</i>
<i>leader of the high council.</i>

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,125
<i>This visit should also provide</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

6
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,667
<i>for one of my officers</i>
<i>to correct a grave injustice.</i>

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,041
(<i> door chimes</i> )

8
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,709
Enter.

9
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:29,750
Am I intruding?

10
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,250
No, sir.

11
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,792
My apologies, Captain.
I can be back in uniform...

12
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:35,125
No. That won't be
necessary, Mr. Worf.

13
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,458
I'm not here
as your captain.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,333
I'm here as the man
who stood with you

15
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,709
before the high council,
your Cha'dich.

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,375
We will arrive at your home
world in less than a day.

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,250
It is not time yet.

18
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,333
That doesn't sound
like the man who came
to me a year ago,

19
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,667
fiercely determined
to return home

20
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:02,542
to clear his father's
name or die trying.

21
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,917
Isn't it time to
confront the council,

22
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:10,458
to regain your family name,
let the truth be known?

23
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:18,291
I have been told that
patience is sometimes

24
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,750
a more effective weapon
then the sword.

25
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,208
Patience
is a human virtue--

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,625
one that I am glad to see
you've taken to heart--

27
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:33,625
but doesn't this
situation require
a more Klingon response?

28
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:41,166
Your discommendation
is a facade to protect
less honorable men.

29
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,834
It is a lie.
Lies must be challenged.

30
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:51,500
I have grown weary of
bearing this dishonor.

31
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:54,875
RIKER:
Riker to Picard.
Go ahead, Number One.

32
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:58,333
We've been intercepted
by the Klingon vessel<i> Bortas.</i>

33
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,000
They claim to be our escort.

34
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,291
No escort was scheduled.

35
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,291
The<i> Bortas</i>
<i>is standing by, sir.</i>

36
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,458
On screen.

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,375
Gowron, this is
an unexpected pleasure.

38
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,291
I must speak
with you, Picard.

39
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,542
We will have to
move quickly if we
are to be successful.

40
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,917
Successful?

41
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,208
Yes.

42
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:30,083
In preventing
a Klingon civil war.

43
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:07,959
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

44
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:12,417
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

45
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,083
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

46
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,750
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

47
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:22,166
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

48
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:27,041
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

49
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:27,667
The family of Duras
is massing support.

50
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,375
They have many allies
on the council.

51
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,083
Duras died in disgrace.

52
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,083
By Klingon tradition,
his family should
share that disgrace.

53
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,041
Their corruption has
poisoned the empire.

54
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,959
Honor will soon
have no meaning.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,333
And who speaks for
his family now?

56
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:48,792
Lursa and B'etor,
the sisters of Duras.

57
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:51,542
And they would claim
the leadership of
the council?

58
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,709
Women may not serve
on the council.

59
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,250
Then how...?

60
00:04:56,291 --> 00:05:00,375
I don't know, but they
are plotting something.

61
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:02,375
They have
secured the loyalty

62
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:05,500
of at least three
fleet commanders.

63
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:08,417
Lursa and B'etor
are feared,

64
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,166
and fear is power.

65
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,375
I do not see what
I can do to assist.

66
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:18,458
You were first chosen
as arbiter of succession

67
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,875
because no Klingon
could be trusted.

68
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,834
You accepted this duty

69
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,166
and you must see it
through to the end.

70
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,917
You must insure
my installation.

71
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,208
That is
beyond my purview.

72
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,667
You will not support me?

73
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:47,375
I will not step outside
the traditional role
of the arbiter.

74
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:50,208
And if they attempt to
block my installation?

75
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,166
Then I can only assure
you that I will deal

76
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,333
with any challenge
according to Klingon law.

77
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:06,000
I fear that will
not be enough.

78
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:11,667
Mr. Worf, would you
escort our guest to
the transporter room?

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,917
Begin monitoring
Romulan activity

80
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,917
along the neutral zone,
Mr. Data,

81
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,834
and have the outpost
stations send us
their tactical reports.

82
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,000
DATA:
Aye, sir.

83
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,375
The Duras family
are preparing to
move against Gowron.

84
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,542
Backed by Romulans?

85
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,625
I don't know.

86
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,792
But there is
too much history

87
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,375
between the Duras
and the Romulans

88
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,667
to discount
the possibility.

89
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,709
Dismissed.

90
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,667
I would speak with you.

91
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:07,917
I do not hear the words
of traitors.

92
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,750
I am not a traitor.

93
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:18,792
You admitted your guilt
before the council.

94
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:22,291
I accepted discommendation
to protect the empire.

95
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:26,500
Protect it?
How?

96
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:31,667
It was Duras's father
who betrayed our people

97
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:34,583
to the Romulans at
Khitomer, not mine.

98
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,583
Duras?

99
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,208
There is proof of this?

100
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,458
There is.

101
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,458
Why would you accept
dishonor to protect Duras?

102
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,333
His family
was too powerful.

103
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,583
To expose him would
have split the empire.

104
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:03,333
Instead, the council
chose to blame my father.

105
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,875
The council knew?

106
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:21,417
I believe you to be
a man of honor, Gowron.

107
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,583
I ask you.

108
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,208
Restore my family name.

109
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,583
Worf...

110
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,333
you killed Duras.

111
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,166
I consider that
no small favor,

112
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,166
but what you ask
is impossible.

113
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,834
But after
your installation...

114
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:51,333
The grasp of Duras
reaches out from the grave.

115
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:58,166
Much of the council is
still loyal to his family.

116
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:04,333
I must have the council's
support to survive.

117
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:08,000
I cannot expose
their treachery.

118
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:13,417
You chose to accept
this disgrace

119
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,834
for the good
of the empire.

120
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:22,458
Now you must live
with your decision
like a Klingon.

121
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:32,834
(<i> phaser firing</i> )

122
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,458
(<i> door opening</i> )

123
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,417
Guinan?

124
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,917
It was a little quiet
down in Ten Forward

125
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,333
so I thought I'd get off
a little target practice.

126
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,959
Do you mind
if I join you?

127
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,041
You... practice?

128
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,000
I like to
keep my eye sharp.

129
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,250
I practice at level 14.

130
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:01,875
Hmm. I guess I could
come down to that
level for a while.

131
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:04,458
Begin program.

132
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:11,458
You know, I had a bet
with the captain that
I could make you laugh

133
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
before you became
lieutenant commander.

134
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:18,458
Not a good bet today.

135
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:23,166
I've seen you laugh.
I like it.

136
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,750
Klingons do not laugh.

137
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:32,458
Oh, yes, they do.
Absolutely they do.

138
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,542
You don't, but I've heard
Klingon belly laughs

139
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,083
that will curl your hair.

140
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,709
Your son laughs;
he's Klingon.

141
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,709
He is a child
and part human.

142
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,166
That's right,
and you're not.

143
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,083
You're a full Klingon,
except you don't laugh.

144
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,083
I do not laugh because
I do not feel like laughing.

145
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,625
Other Klingons
feel like laughing.

146
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,291
What does that say
about you?

147
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,792
Perhaps it says
that I do not feel
like other Klingons.

148
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,625
COMPUTER:
Program complete.

149
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,458
Good game.
Don't feel bad.

150
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,959
I was doing this long
before you were born.

151
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,542
So how is he?
Your son.

152
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:23,542
He is having difficulty
adjusting to life on Earth.

153
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,667
Oh. I could see
where it might be hard
for the little guy,

154
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:29,041
living with humans,
being Klingon.

155
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,166
It could be
very confusing.

156
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,417
It will not be
easy for him.

157
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,667
No, it won't, but at
some point, he's going
to want to know

158
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:39,500
what it's like to
really be a Klingon,

159
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:41,917
just as you're
learning now.

160
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,458
(<i> door chimes</i> )

161
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,750
Come.

162
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,291
Captain, I request
a leave of absence.

163
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,500
Mr. Worf,
request granted.

164
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:15,583
Thank you, sir.

165
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:18,875
Lieutenant.

166
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,125
<i>Qapla!</i>

167
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,917
And good luck.

168
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,917
<i>Lieutenant Worf, personal Log:</i>
<i>Stardate 44996.1.</i>

169
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,750
<i>I have located</i>

172
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:05,083
It has been too long,
my brother.

173
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,834
Too long.

174
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,000
We have much
to discuss.

175
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,917
I have asked Gowron to
restore our family honor.

176
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,667
He has refused.

177
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,959
Gowron will not live
to see the day he
leads the council.

178
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,125
What do you mean?

179
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,959
He stands alone,
surrounded by his enemies.

180
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,375
Lursa and B'etor
would have him killed,

181
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,959
and if they don't,
I will.

182
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,125
You will?
Gowron is weak.

183
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:35,959
The family of Duras
must never be allowed
to rule the council.

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,083
Our leaders
have failed us.

185
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,583
They no longer deserve
our loyalty.

186
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,875
It is time to sweep away
the old council

187
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:53,709
and put a new one
in its place.

188
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,166
How can this be done?

189
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,542
I already have the support
of four squadron commanders

190
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,291
in key strategic sectors.

191
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,166
When the time comes,
they will follow me.

192
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,834
Join us, Worf,

193
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:13,166
and we will usher in
a new era and regain
our family name.

194
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,917
No.

195
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,959
What?!

196
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,250
Gowron has completed
the rite of succession.

197
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,750
It is our duty
to support him.

198
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,834
Gowron spits in your
face when you ask him

199
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,458
to give back what
is rightfully ours

200
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,083
and you would
support him.

201
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:51,208
We cannot regain honor
by acting dishonorably.

202
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,500
I<i> will not</i> support Gowron.

203
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,583
I am the elder brother,
Kurn.

204
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,500
I speak for our family.

205
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:05,583
We will back Gowron.

206
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,417
But not now.
Not yet.

207
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:18,333
We will wait
until he feels the
grasp of his enemies

208
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,834
around his throat.

209
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:25,125
Then we will offer
him our support

210
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:30,375
and the price will
be the restoration
of our family name.

211
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,667
It will be difficult
to convince my allies

212
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:51,500
to back Gowron,
but I will try.

213
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:54,250
I must go
to the Mempa sector

214
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,083
to meet with the other
squadron commanders.

215
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,542
Contact me when you have
gained their support.

216
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:04,250
Then I will be
ready for Gowron.

217
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:12,792
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log:</i>
<i>Stardate 44996.8.</i>

218
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:16,000
<i>My role as arbiter of</i>
<i>succession has again brought me</i>

219
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,792
<i>to the great hall of</i>
<i>the Klingon high council.</i>

220
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,417
<i>Nadev ghos.</i>

221
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,291
Have you reached
a decision

222
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,375
regarding the
succession of power?

223
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,333
<i>Qaja plu d'itch jung!</i>

224
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,917
<i>La woq yon ghir</i>
<i>klas qimha!</i>

225
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,500
Gowron.

226
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,458
<i>Doj hon.</i>

227
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,083
<i>Doj hon.</i>

228
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:56,291
Gowron, son of M'rel,
<i>hakt'em.</i>

229
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:02,917
The arbiter confirms
that you have completed
the rite of succession.

230
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,208
Your enemies
have been destroyed.

231
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,959
You stand alone.

232
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,417
Do you wish to
claim leadership
of the council?

233
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,625
I wish it.

234
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,250
Are there no
other challengers?

235
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:33,959
There is one.

236
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,667
I will challenge him.

237
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:40,083
An arrogant child?

238
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,083
Who are you?

239
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,709
I am Toral,
son of Duras.

240
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,250
Duras had no son.

241
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,792
But he did, Gowron.

242
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:55,375
So this is
your doing, Lursa.

243
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:58,250
We wish to
address the council.

244
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,291
Lursa, B'etor,
come forward.

245
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,875
Members of
the high council,

246
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:17,875
it is a day of rejoicing
for the family of Duras
and the Klingon empire.

247
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:23,291
We have discovered that
our brother did indeed
have a son and heir.

248
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:27,792
This is outrageous.
Duras had no mate.

249
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:30,542
Where did you
find him, Lursa?

250
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,041
In a harlot's bed chamber?

251
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:37,417
I will personally cut
your tongue out,<i> yintagh!</i>

252
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,208
Impudent wretch.

253
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,458
A simple genetic scan
will prove his bloodline
is valid.

254
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,583
The illegitimate son
of Duras cannot rule
the high council.

255
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,583
The arbiter will
consider his validity.

256
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,041
<i>Len'mat.</i>

257
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,750
Our allies on the council
backed Toral's claim.

258
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:24,083
It's in Picard's
hands now.

259
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,583
Excellent.

260
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,625
Everything is proceeding
as scheduled.

261
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,041
Why not just kill Picard?

262
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,250
Fool! Do we want the
Federation as our enemy?

263
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:37,333
No.
At least not yet.

264
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,083
But when
the time is right,

265
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:45,583
we will deal
with the Federation
and Captain Picard.

266
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,250
I have met with the other
squadron commanders here.

267
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,000
Three will join us,
one will not.

268
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:04,041
That gives us enough
strength to control
seven key sectors.

269
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,583
Do you know the strength
of our enemies?

270
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,917
They have at least
seven squadrons,
but most of the fleet

271
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,625
has not decided
which banner to follow.

272
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:17,542
Well, Gowron is nearly
out of options.

273
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,834
Soon he will have
no choice.

274
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,542
I will return soon
to the home world.

275
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,500
We shall meet then.

276
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,917
Do you also require
the original logs

277
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,667
recorded during
the attack, Lieutenant?

278
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:34,125
Everything we have
on the Khitomer massacre.

279
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,166
We can provide you
with our analysis of
the communications

280
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,291
between the Khitomer
outpost and the
Romulan ships.

281
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,750
However, for a complete
record, you will have to
contact Starbase 24.

282
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:47,250
Mr. Worf, have you
cancelled your leave?

283
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,834
No, sir.

284
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,458
Lieutenant, would you
join me in my ready room?

285
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:08,792
Mr. Worf, you are
using our files on
the Khitomer massacre

286
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,458
as evidence against
Duras's father.

287
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,041
Yes, sir.

288
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,333
Do you not see an inherent
conflict of interest here?

289
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,000
Sir, those Federation
records will help me prove

290
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,250
my father was falsely
accused of treason.

291
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,750
You are using your position
as a starfleet officer

292
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:27,542
to affect political change
on your planet.

293
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:31,375
There could not be a
worse compromise of our
fundamental principles.

294
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:33,417
Do not tie my hands now.

295
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,375
I must be able to prove
my father's innocence.

296
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:41,250
Those Federation records
can do that.

297
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,917
Mr. Worf...

298
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,792
here I am, lecturing you
on a conflict of interest

299
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:54,542
while I'm desperately trying
to avoid one of my own.

300
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,083
Do you think I wish to
allow the Duras family

301
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,500
to solidify their hold
on the council?

302
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,625
Do you think I cannot
see for myself

303
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,542
the implications
for the Federation?

304
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:08,250
Good Lord, Duras tried
to have me killed.

305
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,959
All of my instincts,
my training,

306
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,500
my very being
as a starfleet officer

307
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,667
are at odds
with my responsibility

308
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:19,375
as arbiter of the
Klingon high council.

309
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:22,917
We walk the same
tightrope between
two worlds, you and I.

310
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:25,041
We must try our very best

311
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:29,000
to keep those
two worlds separate

312
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,834
or we shall
certainly fall.

313
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:36,125
Yes, sir.

314
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:41,792
I will make the
Khitomer massacre files

315
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:44,291
available to anyone
who wants them--

316
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,333
to the high council,
to the Duras family,

317
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,041
to you... anyone.

318
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,125
Thank you, sir.

319
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,333
Mr. Worf...

320
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,625
this is as far
as I will go.

321
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:06,583
RIKER:
Riker to Picard.
Yes, Number One?

322
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,917
There's a message coming in
for you from the surface.

323
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,709
It's coded personal.

324
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,792
Send it through.

325
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:22,750
Captain.

326
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,583
Welcome.

327
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,041
Please, come in.

328
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,625
Be seated.

329
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,834
Something to drink,
Captain?

330
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:44,750
Tea.
Earl Grey, perhaps?

331
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:46,875
Thank you.

332
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:50,750
You come alone
and unarmed.

333
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:53,375
Nothing will be served
by killing the arbiter

334
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:54,750
<i>before</i> his decision.

335
00:23:54,792 --> 00:24:00,333
Nevertheless,
a brave act, Captain.

336
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,917
B'etor.

337
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,250
Your invitation
was unexpected.

338
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,500
We should have
extended it much sooner.

339
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,834
We don't want you
to judge us

340
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,041
by your experience
with our brother.

341
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,834
B'ETOR:
Duras was a fool.

342
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,083
He deserved to die.

343
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,834
Forget him.
We have.

344
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:33,333
We do not wish
to be your enemy.

345
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,959
Quite the opposite.

346
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,458
That pleases me.

347
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,709
Have you...
have you made
your decision

348
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,083
regarding
Toral's challenge?

349
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,625
I'm pursuing it
with due vigilance.

350
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:51,959
Allow me to heat up
your tea.

351
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,667
Toral has the bloodline
to lead the empire

352
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,458
into the next century.

353
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,500
He has the support
of the people.

354
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:02,333
Then it remains to see if
he has the support of law.

355
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:07,542
But he must.
Surely you can see that.

356
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,500
I'll tell you what I see.

357
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:12,625
If I find
Toral's challenge valid,

358
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:16,041
the two of you will
very quickly gain
control of the council

359
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:20,834
and Gowron
will be found dead
shortly thereafter.

360
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:23,542
If I reject Toral's claim,

361
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:26,875
you will accuse me of
serving Federation interest

362
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:29,291
and it will serve
as a rallying cry

363
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:32,041
to declare war
and overthrow Gowron.

364
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:38,291
You see very clearly,
Captain, but one
thing is missing.

365
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:44,417
If you rule against us
and we are victorious

366
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:47,250
in a war against Gowron...
Which we would be.

367
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:51,125
...it will mean the
end of the alliance
with the Federation.

368
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,834
And we would hate to
see that happen as
much as you would.

369
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:57,166
This is not a threat,
Captain.

370
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,959
Just an unfortunate
truth.

371
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,667
So why be our enemy when
you can be our friend?

372
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,834
You have manipulated
the circumstances

373
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,667
with the skill
of a Romulan.

374
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:17,667
My decision
will be announced
at high sun tomorrow.

375
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,333
Excellent tea.

376
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:22,166
Good day, ladies.

377
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,917
What is your decision?

378
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:49,291
K'tal, this council knows
the law of heredity well.

379
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:52,542
<i>G'now juk hol pajhard.</i>

380
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:58,625
A son shall share
in the honors or
crimes of his father.

381
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,792
Toral is Duras's son.

382
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:03,125
That has been established
by genetic scan,

383
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:06,458
but with due respect to
the traditions and laws

384
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,959
of this high council,
there is no basis

385
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,917
for accepting a petition
for leadership

386
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:14,333
from a boy who
has fought no battles,

387
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:17,166
shed no blood
for his people,

388
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:20,291
nor earned
honor for himself.

389
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:26,291
One day, perhaps,
he shall, but not now.

390
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,000
Duras is dead.

391
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:32,041
His claim to the
leadership died with him.

392
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,542
Gowron shall lead
the council.

393
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,250
The arbiter has ruled.

394
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,625
There are
no more challenges.

395
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:48,250
Does the Federation
dictate Klingon destiny
or do we?

396
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:52,250
Follow me, and I will
show you honor.

397
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:00,583
Follow him, and you reject
all Klingon law.

398
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:15,834
Can you not see
what you are doing?

399
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:19,083
Are you blind to
what they represent?

400
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,083
Then go.

401
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:26,709
Your blood will paint
the way to the future.

402
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:02,458
Your message said
it was urgent.

403
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,667
What do you want?

404
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:06,875
Your forces
are weak, Gowron.

405
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:09,500
You need help to fight
the family of Duras.

406
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:12,375
From one
dishonored Klingon.

407
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:17,166
I offer you four
Klingon squadrons.

408
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:20,500
Why would they follow you,
a starfleet officer?

409
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:24,083
They are pledged to
support my brother, Kurn.

410
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,291
Kurn is your brother?

411
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:31,625
Yes. His true bloodlines
were hidden to protect him.

412
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:34,125
Kurn will follow me?

413
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,542
He has opposed me
in the past.

414
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:39,333
<i>I</i> am the elder brother.

415
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:41,291
He will do as I say.

416
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,333
What is it
you want in return?

417
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:46,166
You know my price.

418
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,291
The return
of your honor

419
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,792
for the support
of four squadrons.

420
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:53,834
No. That will
not be enough.

421
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:58,917
The Duras family controls
most of the fleet.

422
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:01,959
We must have
Federation help.

423
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,959
They will not intervene.

424
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,542
Perhaps not yet,
but starfleet command
will listen to Picard

425
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,834
and Picard...
listens to you.

426
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:16,375
I can ask nothing more
of him in this matter.

427
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,417
What?

428
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,875
My duty as
a starfleet officer...

429
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:25,166
You come to me and
demand the restoration
of your family honor

430
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:32,000
and now you hide
behind human excuses.

431
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,291
What are you, Worf?

432
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,583
Do you tremble
and quake with fear

433
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:42,166
at the approach of combat,

434
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:46,542
hoping to talk your way
out of a fight like a human

435
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:50,709
or do you hear
the cry of the warrior

436
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,250
calling you to battle,

437
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:55,583
calling you to glory
like a Klingon?

438
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,041
<i>( explosive hit )</i>

439
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:04,709
<i>( speaking Klingon )</i>
Status!

440
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,083
Aft shields down.

441
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,291
Warp coils damaged.

442
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,000
Red alert.

443
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,917
A second ship is joining
the attack on the<i> Bortas.</i>

444
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:21,542
It's begun.

445
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:31,709
Send an emergency signal
to any loyal ships!

446
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,417
Impulse engines
not responding!

447
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:47,125
Engage emergency override.

448
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,250
Override engaged.

449
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:52,959
Disruptors still
not responding.

450
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,500
The<i> Bortas</i> has lost
her port shields, sir.

451
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:58,583
It is unlikely they
will withstand another
hit in that quarter.

452
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,792
Their primary life support
has failed, sir.

453
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:05,917
The<i> Bortas</i> has put out
a general distress call.

454
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:20,417
Ensign Reel, plot a course
to take us safely from
the combat area.

455
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,583
Half impulse.

456
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:24,542
Captain, the<i> Bortas</i> 
is Gowron's ship.

457
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:27,542
If he's the legitimate
leader of the empire,
shouldn't we help him?

458
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:29,291
If we go to the aid
of the<i> Bortas,</i>

459
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:32,542
we'll be dragging
the Federation into
a Klingon civil war.

460
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,500
What about Worf?

461
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,709
Ensign.

462
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,208
Engage.

463
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,417
Port shields
are still down.

464
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,417
Disruptors online.

465
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:53,709
Lock on target.

466
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,667
No. Don't you see?

467
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,750
Their sensors will
detect the weapons lock.

468
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,333
If they think we're
helpless, they will
try to board the ship.

469
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:04,834
I can aim and fire
disruptors manually when
they drop their shields.

470
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,917
<i>Ghos!</i>

471
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:16,625
35,000 kellicams.

472
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,667
20,000 kellicams.

473
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:22,083
Now within
transporter range.

474
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,500
<i>Suh!</i>

475
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:27,166
They're dropping
their shields!

476
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:28,333
<i>Bah!</i>

477
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,959
WORF:
Firing on second target.

478
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,208
They were able to raise
the shields in time.

479
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,750
Minor damage only.

480
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,208
Disruptors off-line.

481
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,834
All power to shields!

482
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,166
Shields failing.

483
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,125
Incoming message.

484
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,375
On viewer!

485
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,250
This is Captain Kurn
of the<i> Hegh'ta.</i>

486
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:20,083
We come to defend the
empire and to follow
the banner of Gowron.

487
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,458
You have done well,
Captain Kurn.

488
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,333
Lursa and B'etor
have moved more quickly
than I anticipated.

489
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,959
We shall not
underestimate them again.

490
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,625
Meet us at the great hall.

491
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,250
Advise the<i> Enterprise</i>

492
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:42,583
that their delegation
is welcome to attend

493
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:45,542
my installation as leader.

494
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:51,959
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log:</i>
<i>Stardate 44998.3.</i>

495
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,750
<i>With new-found support,</i>

496
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:57,458
<i>Gowron has chosen to proceed</i>
<i>with the installation ceremony.</i>

497
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,709
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has returned</i>

498
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,709
<i>so that I may perform my final</i>
<i>duty as arbiter of succession.</i>

499
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:24,750
Receive now the loyalty
of the council

500
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:25,917
and of the empire.

501
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,625
BOTH:
<i>Qapla!</i>

502
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:39,375
<i>Nadev ghos.</i>

503
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:53,834
You both fought
as warriors.

504
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:57,291
You have proven your
hearts are Klingon!

505
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:08,208
I return
your family honor.

506
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:13,542
I give you back that
which was wrongfully
taken from you.

507
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:17,792
Let your name be
spoken once again.

508
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:24,166
You are Worf,
son of Mogh.

509
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:45,542
The Duras family is
gathering a large force
near Beta Thoridor.

510
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,417
As per the terms
of the treaty of alliance,

511
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,750
I now formally request
your assistance

512
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,208
in fighting these enemies
of the empire.

513
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,959
These enemies are Klingon.

514
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,709
By right and tradition,
I am the sole leader.

515
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:06,083
All who oppose me
are traitors.

516
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,375
I understand your position,
but I'm sure you're aware

517
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:10,333
that the Federation
cannot interfere

518
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:14,625
in, what is by definition,
an internal Klingon affair.

519
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:18,208
You arbitrated the
right of succession.

520
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,625
You are already involved.

521
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,625
My duties in that
regard are finished.

522
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:27,250
Captain,
we must intervene.

523
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:30,166
The Duras family is corrupt
and hungry for power

524
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:33,166
with no sense
of honor or loyalty.

525
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,750
They represent
a grave threat

526
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,792
to the security
of the Federation.

527
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:40,041
Captain...

528
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:45,750
you and I know that
they have conspired

529
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:47,750
with Romulans
in the past.

530
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:50,458
If they should be
victors in this war,

531
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,792
they would surely form a new
Klingon/Romulan alliance,

532
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:57,875
and that would represent
a fundamental shift of
power in this quadrant.

533
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:00,959
Starfleet
must support Gowron.

534
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,333
It is in the interest
of both the Federation
and the empire.

535
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:10,709
I beg you.
Support us in our cause.

536
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,583
Mr. Worf, I don't
have to lecture you

537
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,208
on the principal
of non-interference.

538
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,583
And as starfleet officers,
we have all sworn an oath

539
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,542
to uphold that
principal, whatever
our personal feelings,

540
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:25,000
and I'm sorry, I must
refuse your request.

541
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:42,417
Mr. Worf,
I'm afraid I must
recall you to duty.

542
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,667
The<i> Enterprise</i> will
be leaving this
sector immediately.

543
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,125
Captain, I respectfully
request that I be allowed

544
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,000
to take an extended
leave of absence.

545
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,667
Mr. Worf, your
responsibilities
as a starfleet officer

546
00:38:57,709 --> 00:39:00,458
are incompatible with
remaining on board
a Klingon ship

547
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,917
during a time of war.

548
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,166
Captain...

549
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,667
I order you to return
to duty at once.

550
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:19,709
Then I resign my commission
as a starfleet officer.

551
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:29,709
I will await you
aboard the<i> Bortas.</i>

552
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:05,917
(<i> door chimes</i> )

553
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:07,375
Enter.

554
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,083
Am I intruding?

555
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:14,333
No, sir.

556
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:17,041
I understand you will be
serving onboard the<i> Bortas.</i>

557
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,250
As weapons officer.

558
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:24,083
Your tactical knowledge
and experience will
serve them well.

559
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,625
Thank you, sir.

560
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:34,500
Mr. Worf, are you
certain that this is
the right decision?

561
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:44,542
I was rescued from
Khitomer by humans,

562
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:49,583
raised and loved
by human parents.

563
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:55,583
I have spent most of
my life around humans,
fought beside them.

564
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,417
But I was born a Klingon.

565
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,458
My heart is of that world.

566
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:08,291
I do hear the cry
of the warrior.

567
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:13,083
I belong with my people.

568
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:17,166
Being the only Klingon
ever to serve in starfleet

569
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:23,083
gave you a singular
distinction, but...

570
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:30,125
I felt that what was unique
about you was your humanity,

571
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:33,625
compassion, generosity,
fairness.

572
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:38,625
You took the best
qualities of humanity
and made them part of you.

573
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:44,125
The result was a man
who I was proud to call
one of my officers.

574
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:53,750
I'll have your belongings
transported to the<i> Bortas.</i>

575
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:56,583
Thank you, sir.

576
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,417
Attention on deck.

577
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:58,041
Permission to leave
the ship, sir.

578
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:02,750
Permission granted.

579
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:03,959
<i>Qapla.</i>

580
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:11,583
Good-bye.

581
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,000
Dismissed.

582
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:05,166
Picard has rejected
Gowron's plea for help.

583
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:07,917
The<i> Enterprise</i>
has left orbit.

584
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:11,250
Coward! He didn't have
the courage to face us.

585
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:12,417
The Federation...

586
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:14,458
WOMAN:
Celebrate later, Toral.

587
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,542
We should not discount
Jean-Luc Picard yet.

588
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:24,500
He is human,
and humans have a way

589
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:27,875
of showing up when
you least expect them.
