(<i> beeping</i> )

13
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:50,792
Commander, ship's sensors detect
an abnormal energy reading

14
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,333
in the Captain's quarters.

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,333
Type?

16
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,750
Undetermined.

17
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:57,083
Riker to Captain Picard.

18
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,917

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,917
Is something the matter,
Lieutenant?

27
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:37,750
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

28
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:41,917
<i>These are the voyages</i>

It's all right,
it's all right.

35
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,625
I'm not going to hurt you.

36
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:23,917
Ca... Captain...?

37
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,125
Picard of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

38
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,417
Captain Picard.

39
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,500
We studied your missions
at the academy.

40
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:33,917
Mitena Haro, first year cadet,
Starfleet Academy.

41
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,041
Cadet Haro.

42
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,000
Perhaps<i> you</i>
can explain

43
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,625
what this is all about.

44
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,750
Unfortunately, I can't,
Mister...?

45
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:41,750
Tholl.

46
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:44,125
Kova Tholl, of Mizar II.

47
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,542
Well, Mr. Tholl, all I know is

48
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,250
that I've been brought here
against my will.

49
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,250
Wherever "here" is.

50
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,000
The same thing
happened to me, sir.

51
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,875
I-I was alone, studying,
and... I fainted.

52
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:59,750
When I came to...

53
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:02,792
It was about three days ago.

54
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,583
And you, sir?

55
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,375
I've been here
12 days

56
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:08,458
possibly more.

57
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,959
I had been meditating privately

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,542
and for no reason whatever,
I lost consciousness.

59
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,709
What can you tell me
about our captors?

60
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,667
Nothing.
They've never shown themselves.

61
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:25,166
Four sleeping areas.

62
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:29,166
That implies we may be joined
by another captive.

63
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,583
It's edible

64
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,500
but I wouldn't
call it food.

65
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,250
Hmm...

66
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,834
I wouldn't
touch that.

67
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:08,792
Why not?

68
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,625
If it's the door lock

69
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:15,083
the combination is too complex
to hit at random.

70
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,375
I tried it... and was punished.

71
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:21,709
Punished?

72
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,083
How?

73
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,417
Severe pain.

74
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,083
Some sort of energy beam.

75
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,542
I won't go near
that panel again.

76
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,750
(<i> communications beep</i> )

77
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:41,417
WORF:
Sir, the<i> Hood</i> has arrived
at the rendezvous point.

78
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:45,458
They are expecting us
in 36 hours.

79
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,750
Thank you, Lieutenant.

80
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,542
Mr. Data

81
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,583
the nearest pulsar
is in the Lonka Cluster

82
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,625
is it not?

83
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:56,792
Correct, sir.

84
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,959
What do we know
about that pulsar?

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,417
A great deal, sir.

86
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,959
It is a rotating neutron star

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,917
of approximately
4.356 solar masses...

88
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,000
Mr. Crusher, how long would it
take us to get there?

89
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:12,166
At warp seven,
34 minutes, sir.

90
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,667
Mr. Crusher,
make it so.

91
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,250
Sir?

92
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,583
Set course for
the Lonka Cluster.

93
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,625
Warp two.

94
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:24,250
Aye, sir.

95
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,458
Sir, at warp two

96
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,542
we'll arrive at the pulsar
in 31 hours.

97
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,750
Thank you, Ensign.

98
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:30,917
Engage.

99
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,583
WESLEY:
Aye, sir.

100
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,500
Will we be delaying
our rendezvous with
the<i> Hood,</i> sir?

101
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,333
We may have to,
Number One.

102
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,500
Lieutenant, contact
the<i> Hood</i> and inform
them of our delay.

103
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,583
Aye, Commander.

104
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,125
Belay that order.

105
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,333
There will be no
further communication

106
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,333
off this ship
without my prior
authorization.

107
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,792
Commander, may I
have
a word with you?

108
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,625
Mr. Data, you
have the Bridge.

109
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,291
Aye, sir.

110
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,041
Number One, you know
I like to keep you
well informed

111
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,166
as to the nature
of our missions.

112
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,458
Yes, sir.

113
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,625
And if I don't inform you,
there is a reason.

114
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,417
Well, I don't like
keeping you in the dark

115
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,875
but for the next few days

116
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:17,834
I may not be able to be
as communicative as usual.

117
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,750
It may make things
difficult for you.

118
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:20,917
Don't worry
about me, sir.

119
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,667
I can handle it.

120
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,750
And the crew?

121
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,917
You can count on
all of us, sir.

122
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,959
I appreciate that,
Number One.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,750
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

124
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:35,542
(<i> rhythmic beeping</i> )

125
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,625
Picard

126
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:49,458
what are you doing?

127
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,750
I'm attempting
to let our captors know

128
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:52,959
we possess intelligence.

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,875
You don't think
they already know that?

130
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,542
They can hear us talking.

131
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,917
Yes, but they
may not realize

132
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,500
that we're communicating
through language.

133
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,250
Captain Picard is
letting them know

134
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,834
that we comprehend
mathematics

135
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,625
by tapping out
the first six
prime numbers.

136
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,208
I know<i> what</i> he's doing.

137
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,542
I'm trying to understand<i> why.</i>

138
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,583
It is imperative
that we communicate

139
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,000
with our abductors;
find out what they want.

140
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,583
Obviously, they want us.

141
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,125
Obviously.

142
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,709
But why?

143
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:31,667
What makes our captors
choose us?

144
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,458
What makes us special?

145
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,208
I couldn't say, Captain.

146
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,041
I'm certainly not special.

147
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,917
I am just one cadet.

148
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,500
What's your best
area of study?

149
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:42,625
Impulse propulsion systems.

150
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,333
I'm very good
with field coils.

151
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,709
Good enough to
be useful to
our abductors?

152
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,875
I don't know. Maybe.

153
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,583
But if they needed
an engineer, sir

154
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,542
why didn't they
take a real one?

155
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,458
Why pick a
Starfleet cadet?

156
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,125
That I can't answer.

157
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

158
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:07,709
The Bolians
are maintaining

159
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,458
an uneasy truce
with the Moropa

160
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
are they not?

161
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,917
That's right.

162
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,750
But this does not look like
Moropa technology

163
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:19,000
and even assuming
the Moropa wanted me

164
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:22,500
what would they want
with either of you?

165
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,959
I've never even heard
of the Moropa.

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,417
My race has no enemies.

167
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,959
None?

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,208
In the last 300 years
of Mizarian history

169
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,875
your planet
has been conquered six times.

170
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,875
And we've survived
by not resisting.

171
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:43,792
Mizarians value peace
above confrontation.

172
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,500
And you have no idea
who might have done this?

173
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,667
No, I can't
think of anyone

174
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:49,333
who bears malice
toward my race.

175
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,500
Against you personally?

176
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,083
You can't mean to
suggest that someone

177
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,667
with a personal
grudge against me

178
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:55,959
has gone to all
this trouble?

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,750
I'm not
suggesting anything.

180
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,333
I'm merely trying
to come up

181
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,083
with some explanation
for your abduction.

182
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,166
I am sorry, Picard.
I can't give you one.

183
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,542
I am neither important enough
to hold for ransom

184
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,417
nor radical enough
to be dangerous.

185
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,333
I'm a simple
public servant.

186
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,375
Nevertheless, Mr. Tholl...

187
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,667
(<i> transporter hum</i> )

188
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,834
(<i> groaning</i> )

189
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:29,041
(<i> ferocious growling</i> )

190
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,041
Stop!

191
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,792
We mean you no harm.

192
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:34,458
(<i> snarling growl</i> )

193
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,333
We are prisoners, like yourself.

194
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,750
We are<i> not</i> the enemy.

195
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:43,333
Who has done this?

196
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,709
We don't know.

197
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,875
We were brought here
the same way you were.

198
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,542
Our captors refuse
to show themselves.

199
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,208
I don't trust you.

200
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,667
You must trust us.

201
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:03,166
We wish only to return
to our worlds.

202
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,834
Were you abducted from Chalna?

203
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,291
You know my planet?

204
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, yes.

205
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,166
I visited there 12 years ago
while commanding the<i> Stargazer.</i>

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,333
RIKER:
A five and 20.

207
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,542
Ouch.

208
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:31,000
If it's too rich,
Geordi, fold.

209
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,041
I'm thinking,
I'm thinking.

210
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

211
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,917
Enter.

212
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,417
Counselor, gentlemen.

213
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:41,834
Forgive this intrusion.

214
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,333
I was, uh, just passing by.

215
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,458
You are always
welcome, Captain.

216
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,458
I was wondering, Mr. La Forge

217
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,083
what's our engine
efficiency status?

218
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,375
Operating at 93%, sir.

219
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,125
Hmm. That's very good

220
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,375
but I would like

221
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,750
to increase the
efficiency to 95%.

222
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,667
No problem, Captain.
I'll get right on it.

223
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:04,083
Oh, that's not
an order.

224
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,583
Uh, you can get to it later.

225
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,333
I don't want to disrupt
your recreation.

226
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,333
No, Captain.

227
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,041
It's... it's no problem.

228
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,583
Lady Luck left me long ago.

229
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,834
Would you care
to join us, Captain?

230
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,125
We have an opening.

231
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,792
Um... I'll just observe,
if you don't mind.

232
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,792
Not at all.
Counselor, 20.

233
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:30,208
(<i> chips rattling</i> )

234
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,417
A pair of threes.

235
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,667
Flush, queen high.

236
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:37,125
That beats my fours.

237
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,792
Well played,
Counselor.

238
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,417
Could I have a word
for just a moment?

239
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,834
Certainly, sir.

240
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,375
Forgive me,
gentlemen.

241
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:46,208
I'll return your player
to you in a moment.

242
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,166
Counselor, I, uh...

243
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,000
I wanted to ask you
about the crew.

244
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,333
How are they reacting
to our sudden change in course?

245
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:02,250
I sense
no unusual reactions, Captain.

246
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,417
After all,
such a change is hardly

247
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,792
out of the ordinary.

248
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:08,792
They're not curious
or concerned as to why?

249
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:13,375
They're curious, yes,
but concerned? No.

250
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,709
They trust you.

251
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,125
How far do you think
that trust goes?

252
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,959
Sir?

253
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,166
Oh, I know, Counselor

254
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:29,083
that the crew has always had
full confidence in me, but...

255
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,500
what if it were
to change?

256
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:37,875
Well, I'd inform you,
sir, of course.

257
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,583
Thank you, Counselor.

258
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:54,709
My given name is Esoqq.

259
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,959
It means "fighter."

260
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,417
I'll bet half the names
in the Chalna language

261
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,208
mean "fighter."

262
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,375
Mizarians--

263
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:06,166
your names all
mean "surrender."

264
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,750
We are a peaceful race--

265
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,417
a race of thinkers.

266
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,834
A race of cowards.

267
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,083
And you?

268
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,709
I don't know
your people.

269
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,875
I am Mitena Haro
of Bolarus IX.

270
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:26,959
Who would want to imprison
a child?

271
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,792
I am not a child.

272
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,709
Esoqq, I have been
trying to determine

273
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,875
if we have
a common enemy--

274
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:38,250
someone with a reason
for confining us here.

275
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,959
There are Chalnoth
who would kill me if they could

276
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,834
but kidnap?

277
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,333
There is no reason.

278
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,917
You have many enemies?

279
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,542
None of consequence.

280
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:52,667
I've slain all the ones
who matter.

281
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:54,625
That shocks you, Bolian?

282
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:55,917
A little.

283
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,041
And you?

284
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,750
No, no, I'm
not surprised.

285
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,166
I've heard about your race.

286
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,542
You're uncivilized.

287
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,500
You have no laws,
no system of government.

288
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:08,750
The Chalnoth have no use
for laws or governments.

289
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,750
We are strong.

290
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:12,792
We obey no one.

291
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:17,250
You live in anarchy,
murdering one another.

292
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,125
That mentality
may get us all killed.

293
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,000
And<i> you</i> may be the first.

294
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,834
Both of you--
this is getting us nowhere.

295
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,792
Neither is asking us
useless questions, Picard.

296
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,208
But if you must
pursue the topic

297
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,208
how long have you
and the Romulans

298
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,750
been adversaries?

299
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,000
For quite a while, Mr. Tholl.

300
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:39,333
Oh, I am perfectly willing
to entertain the hypothesis

301
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,834
that our captors are Romulans

302
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,625
but what would the Romulans
want with you?

303
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,333
My brainpower, perhaps.

304
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,166
It's well known
that my species

305
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,667
possesses superior
intelligence and, uh...

306
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,041
I am considered among
the brightest of my people.

307
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,709
HARO:
And the least
modest.

308
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:59,458
(<i> sniffing</i> )

309
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,792
What is this?

310
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:03,709
PICARD:
Food.

311
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,834
The<i> only</i> food?

312
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,208
It would seem so.

313
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,375
Poison!

314
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:14,583
Does this mean

315
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,959
there is nothing here
for you to eat?

316
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:26,625
You.

317
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:27,625
No, don't even think that.

318
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:28,959
Picard, you won't let him...

319
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,834
Esoqq, how long can you go
without food?

320
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:37,750
Three days,
perhaps four.

321
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,166
No longer?

322
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,166
No longer.

323
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,750
Well, all your tests
indicate the same results.

324
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,166
You are in great shape.

325
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,750
I've never felt better.

326
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,041
I see.

327
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,333
Then why did you come in?

328
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,375
Your annual physical
isn't due for another month.

329
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:09,709
Well, usually you
have to remind me,
and badger me

330
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,250
and finally order
me to report.

331
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,750
For once, I thought I'd
save you the trouble.

332
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:19,375
Jean-Luc, be honest
with your doctor.

333
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:22,792
Are there any warning signs
or symptoms

334
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,583
that you haven't told me about?

335
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,125
(<i> deep sigh</i> )

336
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:33,166
As far as I know,
I'm perfectly healthy.

337
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:38,291
Well then, return to your post.

338
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,792
Will you have dinner
with me tonight?

339
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,417
In Ten-Forward?

340
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,166
What about my quarters?

341
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,500
More intimate.

342
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:55,250
Jean-Luc, you are
full of surprises today.

343
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,458
I take that
to be a "yes."

344
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,834
Picard, is it wise
to attempt an escape?

345
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,041
It's imperative.

346
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,500
Why?

347
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:17,917
Our captors haven't
mistreated us.

348
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:21,417
We've been<i> kidnapped,</i>
locked in a room.

349
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,458
You don't think
that's mistreatment?

350
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,291
They haven't hurt
us, have they?

351
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,500
I think we should
just wait

352
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,417
until we find out
what they want.

353
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,625
Be patient.

354
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,667
We can no longer afford
to be patient.

355
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:36,583
Unless we act soon,
Esoqq will starve.

356
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,583
If we antagonize them

357
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,333
they may decide we're more
trouble than we're worth

358
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,333
kill us and go
capture another four.

359
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,792
I agree,
that's a risk

360
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,250
but I see
no alternative.

361
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,875
Well... I refuse to help.

362
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,291
As you wish, Mr. Tholl.

363
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,917
We must get
inside this panel.

364
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:03,583
ESOQQ:
Not very sturdy.

365
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,875
Stand back, Haro.

366
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,709
(<i> Esoqq growling</i> )

367
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,542
The design is simple.

368
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,041
Cross-circuiting
the door mechanism

369
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,709
should be easy.

370
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,709
Make it so.

371
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,041
Yes, sir.

372
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,959
I think I've got it.

373
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,458
(<i> door hums</i> )

374
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,458
(<i> groaning</i> )

375
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,875
I warned you.

376
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,917
Out with it, Jean-Luc.

377
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:31,375
Out with what?

378
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:35,333
Whatever has been on your
mind all evening long.

379
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,041
Hmm. Has it been that apparent?

380
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,875
Mm-hmm.

381
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:41,583
How well you know me.

382
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,417
After all this
time, I ought to.

383
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,875
Well, it's true.

384
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:48,625
I have been preoccupied.

385
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:52,166
I know that's not
very flattering to you

386
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,208
but I have been
thinking about us

387
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,500
and about the choices
I've made.

388
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:01,291
We both have
made choices.

389
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:09,083
And I've been wondering
if they were the right ones.

390
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,542
Sometimes, I feel
we've allowed our positions

391
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,959
to isolate us.

392
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,875
Our positions
necessitate a degree

393
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:19,792
of professional
detachment.

394
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:25,125
But.... there's a danger
in becoming too detached--

395
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,750
of never permitting ourselves
to get closer.

396
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:33,291
Is that what you want, Jean-Luc?

397
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,250
To get closer?

398
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:39,458
You're a very attractive woman.

399
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,417
And you're
a very attractive man.

400
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:49,875
But we both know
it's not as simple as that.

401
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:55,208
Would it be simpler

402
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,750
if I were not
your commanding officer?

403
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,417
Simpler, perhaps.

404
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:07,166
But that's not the only issue.

405
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:13,792
I guess, right now

406
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:15,709
I'm comfortable
with our relationship

407
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,125
just the way it is.

408
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,166
(<i> soft, romantic music begins)</i>

409
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,208
Would you care to dance?

410
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,792
I thought you didn't dance.

411
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:42,166
On special occasions.

412
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,875
I don't think
I told you

413
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,792
but I'm glad you're back
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

414
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:00,792
I missed our friendship.

415
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:03,041
I did, too.

416
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,875
Jean-Luc...

417
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,667
if I didn't
know you better

418
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:50,041
I would think you were
playing games with me.

419
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:53,542
Are you sorry
you came tonight?

420
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,625
I didn't say that.

421
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:56,834
Good.

422
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:00,125
Because I'm delighted
that you did.

423
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:07,375
But perhaps we should
call it a night.

424
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,875
Good night.

425
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,417
I warned you
not to provoke our captors.

426
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,792
The next beams
might be lethal.

427
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,959
Not to you.

428
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,083
You moved far from the door.

429
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,458
Of course I did.

430
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,417
Being stunned once was enough.

431
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,917
You claimed you were hit
by the stun beam

432
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,917
before the rest of us arrived.

433
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:52,125
You could be lying.

434
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:55,458
Maybe our enemy
is watching us

435
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,458
from inside.

436
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,208
Are you accusing me
of collaborating

437
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,625
with our abductors?

438
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:05,792
Collaboration
is what your species does best.

439
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:07,458
You<i> did</i> try

440
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,875
to talk us
out of attempting to escape.

441
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:12,083
For all we know

442
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:15,208
<i>you</i> may be our captor.

443
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,417
(<i> laughs</i> )

444
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,583
Impossible.
I'm a Mizarian.

445
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:21,375
My people
are not aggressive.

446
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:25,166
How can we be sure
you're a Mizarian?

447
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,750
You could be an impostor.

448
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:28,875
This is nonsense.

449
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,500
What if<i> you're</i> an impostor?

450
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:32,667
Esoqq was the last one
to appear.

451
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:35,041
And he<i> is</i> the only one
with a weapon.

452
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,250
Keep talking and I will use it.

453
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:41,083
Tholl, our captors
have transporters.

454
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,500
They have stun beams.

455
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:44,166
It is hardly likely
that they would try

456
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,959
to hold us at bay
with a knife.

457
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,333
Well then, maybe
she's the impostor.

458
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,375
She could have triggered
the stun beams deliberately.

459
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:52,917
I was hit, too.

460
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,291
To forestall
suspicion.

461
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,375
You were very quick
to volunteer.

462
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,959
PICARD:
Tholl,<i> I</i> asked her
to open the door.

463
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,041
You<i> ordered</i> her, you mean.

464
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,417
You've been giving orders
from the moment you got here--

465
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,625
trying to make everyone
do what you want.

466
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:09,083
Tholl, what I want
is for everyone to escape!

467
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:11,709
Why should we
believe you?

468
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,291
Captain Picard's put his life
at stake for others many times.

469
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,375
The primitive culture
on Mintaka III.

470
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:18,750
The Wogneer creatures

471
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:21,458
in the Ordek Nebula.

472
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,625
And Cor Caroli V.

473
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:25,834
Right.

474
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,417
Helping to cure
the Phyrox plague.

475
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:29,625
And how do we know

476
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:32,834
this<i> is</i> the heroic
Captain Picard?

477
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:35,667
We have no proof
of his identity.

478
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:37,750
THOLL:
You've wasted our time

479
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:38,917
with failed attempts

480
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,375
to communicate with them
or escape.

481
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,458
Is that your task?

482
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,125
To keep us busy

483
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:45,875
so we're off guard?

484
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,375
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

485
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:53,500
<i>Although we're still 18 hours</i>
<i>from the Lonka Pulsar</i>

486
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:57,625
<i>the Captain has ordered us</i>
<i>to slow to one-half impulse.</i>

487
00:27:57,667 --> 00:28:00,959
<i>He has offered no explanation.</i>

488
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,250
Here.

489
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,750
I don't know why we're going
to this pulsar.

490
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,667
And creeping up on it
at half-impulse

491
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:10,083
makes even less sense.

492
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,959
The Captain has given
unusual orders before.

493
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,208
I know

494
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,583
but this is different--
<i>he's</i> different.

495
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,792
I can't put my finger on it

496
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:20,959
but I'm worried.

497
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,458
The Captain does seem...

498
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,041
detached from his emotions.

499
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,208
(<i> door opens</i> )

500
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,166

501
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,792
Mr. La Forge, we are operating
at 96% engine efficiency.

502
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:44,834
Well done.

503
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:46,750
Thank you, sir.

504
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,458
When we arrive
at the pulsar

505
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,709
I shall require everyone
at their best.

506
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,375
I know that I can rely
on both of you.

507
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:53,583
Of course, Captain.

508
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:54,625
Excellent.

00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:55,792

00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,875

00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,125
and we trust him.

542
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,625
Then, he runs the crew
through efficiency drills

543
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,667
for the first time
in my tour of duty

544
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:42,333
but he says we need them,
so we need them--

545
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,750
because we trust our Captain.

546
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:46,709
But we also have a Captain

547
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,417
singing drinking songs
with his men.

548
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,083
A captain who's come to the
poker game for the first time.

549
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:56,458
And he was very odd
with me afterwards.

550
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,542
He wanted me to warn him

551
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:02,166
if the crew started
to lose confidence in him.

552
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,959
Any signs of mental stress
or trauma?

553
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,417
He came in
for a physical

554
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:08,709
with no word from me.

555
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,917
Anything unusual, Doctor?

556
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:12,041
Every test result

557
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,000
identical
to his last physical...

558
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:17,083
which is kind of unusual
in itself, actually.

559
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,041
Almost as though
he wanted to establish

560
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,417
that there was nothing wrong.

561
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:24,083
There was one other thing.

562
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:27,166
He asked me to dinner
in his cabin

563
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:31,542
and it was
a very unusual evening.

564
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

565
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:36,917
Which brings up
a very serious possibility.

566
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,709
What if there's an outside
influence at work here?

567
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,959
I detect no evidence
of telepathic coercion.

568
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,667
Commander, there is still one
fact we have not considered--

569
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:50,166
the abnormal energy reading
in the Captain's quarters

570
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,417
was never explained.

571
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,375
It is not enough

572
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,291
evidence
to justify mutiny.

573
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,125
Nobody has suggested
removing the Captain
from command.

574
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:00,000
Right now, all we
have are suspicions

575
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:02,333
not enough to act on.

576
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,709
The next move is his.

577
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,542
THOLL:
Well, Picard

578
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:09,834
prove to us
you're not the enemy.

579
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,542
I can't.

580
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,959
You're right,
Mr. Tholl.

581
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,500
Any one of us may be the enemy

582
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:22,041
and there is no way
to prove that we aren't.

583
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:25,083
But until we set aside
our mutual fears

584
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:29,417
and trust one another,
we have no hope of escape.

585
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:32,792
But, sir, how can we
trust each other?

586
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:34,125
She's right.

587
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,458
There may be
an enemy among us.

588
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,959
And what if there
is, Mr. Tholl?

589
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,792
Shall we continue
accusing one another

590
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,500
until hostility leads
to violence?

591
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:47,917
Shall we allow our suspicions
to destroy us?

592
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,792
Now, let's see if we can
override this stun mechanism.

593
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:05,375
Helm, take us in
to 20 million kilometers.

594
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,333
WESLEY:
Aye, sir.

595
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:10,583
Mr. Worf, divert enough
power to the shields

596
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:13,417
to offset the increased
radiation and magnetic fields.

597
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,166
Sir, at 20 million kilometers

598
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,667
our shields will
only be effective

599
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:19,041
for 18 minutes.

600
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:22,500
Noted, Mr. Data.

601
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:28,041
Captain, may I have
a word with you?

602
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,458
PICARD:
You have the Bridge,
Mr. Data.

603
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,083
Aye, sir.

604
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,125
What is our mission?

605
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:42,542
I'm under no obligation
to tell you that.

606
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:47,125
If you don't, you force me
to take command of this vessel.

607
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,500
On what grounds?

608
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:51,250
You are endangering this ship
for no reason.

609
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,000
No reason you're aware of.

610
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:54,500
That's not
good enough.

611
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:57,041
Your behavior has been erratic.

612
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:00,875
Erratic enough
to justify mutiny?

613
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:02,917
Do you
honestly
believe

614
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:06,625
you have sufficient evidence
to convince a Board of Inquiry?

615
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,709
No, I don't.

616
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,125
But I can't let you risk
the lives of this crew.

617
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:17,208
Number One,
has it occurred to you

618
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,709
that<i> you</i> might be the one
with the problem?

619
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,667
I'm aware you've
been under stress

620
00:34:23,709 --> 00:34:25,625
and I am willing to
let the matter drop

621
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:28,250
if you will report to Sick
Bay for a full examination.

622
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:33,625
Otherwise, I will have
to relieve you from duty.

623
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,875
Think about it.

624
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:40,125
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

625
00:34:58,542 --> 00:34:59,750
Cadet.

626
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:04,208
(<i> clicking</i> )

627
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:13,375
I may have
overloaded it, sir.

628
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:17,625
(<i> grunting</i> )

629
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:18,834
Mr. Tholl!

630
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,792
I still think this is a mistake.

631
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,583
Now what?

632
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:35,458
We're no better off
than when we started.

633
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:50,542
Captain, number four shield
has failed.

634
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:53,125
Increasing power to number three
shield to compensate.

635
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:55,333
Helm, move us closer.

636
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,000
Ten million kilometers.

637
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:00,041
DATA:
Sir, at that distance

638
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,709
the ship will not withstand the
magnetic fields and radiation.

639
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,625
We will not
survive.

640
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,208
Take us in, Mr. Crusher.

641
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,583
Belay that order.

642
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,458
You're relieved of duty,
Commander.

643
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,875
Mr. Worf, confine Mr. Riker
to his quarters.

644
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,625
Mr. Worf,
I gave you an order.

645
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:49,333
Maintain your position,
Lieutenant.

646
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,709
You're destroying yourself

647
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,959
and anyone foolish enough
to listen to you.

648
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:59,041
You've shown none of the concern
Captain Picard would

649
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:04,291
for the safety of this ship,
the welfare of his crew.

650
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:08,041
Mr. Worf, escort Commander Riker
from the Bridge.

651
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,583
Ensign Crusher,
take us away from this pulsar.

652
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:19,458
Heading 185 mark
32, full impulse.

653
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:31,125
Full impulse.
Aye, Commander.

654
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,208
Engage.

655
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,709
I hope you're
satisfied, Picard.

656
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,458
You've accomplished
nothing.

657
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,542
The sound of your voice
is beginning to anger me.

658
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,583
Well...

659
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:56,792
I think this charade
has gone far enough.

660
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:58,583
Don't you?

661
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,458
I don't understand.

662
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,250
Oh, yes, you do.

663
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:05,750
This isn't a holding cell.

664
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:10,291
It's a laboratory maze,
a carefully structured test.

665
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,709
It's an experiment to see
how well we react

666
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,750
under pressure.

667
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,166
How do you know?

668
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,583
It's the only explanation.

669
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,750
Look at the four of us.

670
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,875
We do have something
in common--

671
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:25,458
we all react differently
to authority.

672
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,750
You, the collaborator,
defer to whoever has control

673
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:35,500
you, the anarchist,
reject authority in any form.

674
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:39,417
I, a Starfleet Captain,
trained to command

675
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:41,667
and you...

676
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:44,166
a Starfleet cadet

677
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:47,667
sworn to obey a superior
officer's authority.

678
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:49,709
Our captors have placed us here

679
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,917
and have devised obstacles
for us to overcome.

680
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:54,291
They give us food

681
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:58,500
which Esoqq can't eat,
to make him a threat.

682
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:02,750
They give us a door
we can't open

683
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:05,875
until the four
of us cooperate

684
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:08,000
and each time
we succeed

685
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,542
they deal us reverses

686
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,625
to set us
against each other again

687
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:17,917
while<i> you</i> observe
our reactions.

688
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:21,750
Sir, I've been trying to help.

689
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,500
I found it unlikely
that a first-year cadet

690
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:27,083
would know of the<i> Enterprise's</i>
visit to Mintaka III

691
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,625
so I tested you.

692
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,542
Starfleet has classified

693
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:34,792
the Cor Caroli V plague
as "secret."

694
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:39,625
No cadet would
have knowledge
of that incident.

695
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:40,792
Captain...

696
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:43,417
So you may as well
drop this pretense.

697
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:45,041
I'm not playing any further.

698
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,458
I'm quitting this game.

699
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,208
As far as I am concerned
this experiment is over!

700
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,792
(<i> voice resonating</i> ):
You are correct, Captain Picard.

701
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:06,417
To further our knowledge
of alien interaction

702
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:10,291
we borrowed you, Tholl and Esoqq
and replaced you with replicas.

703
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,709
Replicas?

704
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,417
Our transporter is able
to replicate living matter

705
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,917
including the brain's many
trillion dendritic connections

706
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,250
where memory is stored.

707
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,250
THOLL:
You mean, there's
a copy of me

708
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,542
on Mizar II?

709
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,125
An impostor running my ship?

710
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,625
No longer.

711
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:27,083
Commander Riker has taken charge
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

712
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,083
Our species is
telepathically linked.

713
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,208
We are all in
continual contact.

714
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,667
Much more efficient than your
primitive vocal communications.

715
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:37,500
We would like to...
pursue this study

716
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:40,500
but, of course, your awareness
of it would taint the results.

717
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:43,542
We will, therefore, return you
to your places of origin.

718
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,917
Captain!

719
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:55,125
Hold your
positions.

720
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,166
Take no action.

721
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,417
Why did you choose to study

722
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:12,041
the concepts
of authority
and leadership?

723
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:15,375
Because our species
has no such concepts.

724
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:16,667
As we are all identical

725
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:18,792
distinctions among ourselves
are meaningless.

726
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:21,041
Hence, we have
no leaders no followers.

727
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:23,333
We wanted to examine the nature
of command.

728
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:25,583
Our replicas
of Tholl and Esoqq

729
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,959
explored this issue
on Mizar II and on Chalna

730
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,041
just as our Picard
replica did

731
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,125
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

732
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:32,208
Your responses were

733
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,500
most intriguing.

734
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,959
You have no right
to put us through this

735
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,458
just to satisfy your curiosity.

736
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:41,542
Why not?

737
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,000
Because kidnapping
is an immoral assault.

738
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:46,458
The rights of other races
must be respected.

739
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,375
This concept
of morality

740
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,583
is a very interesting
human characteristic.

741
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:51,542
We shall have

742
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:52,625
to study it
sometime.

743
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:53,750
Now, Mr. Worf.

744
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:59,792
(<i> grunting in pain</i> )

745
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:03,667
What is it?

746
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:05,125
Why do you hold us?

747
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:08,834
Because there is something else
you can learn.

748
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:10,583
With an alert crew

749
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:15,250
even our "primitive vocal
communications" are unnecessary.

750
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:18,375
With a single look,
I was able to inform my crew

751
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:19,917
that I wanted to hold you here.

752
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:21,458
But why?

753
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,542
Because I have decided

754
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,208
to conduct an experiment
of my own.

755
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,000
I want to see
how<i> you</i> react to
being imprisoned.

756
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,083
Captain, our species
cannot bear captivity.

757
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:32,583
We were merely
curious.
We meant no harm.

758
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,041
We did not, after all,
injure you in any way.

759
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:36,875
Imprisonment is an injury

760
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:39,542
regardless
of how you justify it.

761
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:47,000
(<i> crying out</i> )

762
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:49,250
(<i> gasping</i> )

763
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:55,750
(<i> breathing slows</i> )

764
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:58,750
PICARD:
And now that you have had
a taste of captivity

765
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:01,583
perhaps you will reconsider
the morality

766
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:02,875
of inflicting it
on others.

767
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:05,458
In any event, we
now know of your race

768
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,500
and we know how to imprison you.

769
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:11,125
Bear that in mind.

770
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:13,834
Now get off my ship.

771
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,333
Mr. Crusher, set
course to rendezvous
with the<i> Hood.</i> Warp 8.

772
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:23,208
Aye, sir. It's good
to have you back, sir.

773
00:43:24,709 --> 00:43:26,083
Status, Number One?

774
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:30,166
Ship and crew
functioning normally, Captain.

775
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:35,041
Then my doppelganger caused
no serious damage?

776
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,959
The replica was convincing.

777
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,083
Very convincing, but...
not perfect.

778
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:43,125
Not perfect in what way?

779
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:45,792
Well, sir...

780
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:48,875
I find it hard to believe
that you're that good a singer.

781
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,375
Singer?

782
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:57,709
I look forward to reading
your report, Commander.

783
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,375
At least, I think I do.

784
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:00,834
(<i> door opens</i> )

785
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:08,875
Doctor.

786
00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:13,125
Captain.

787
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:20,458
WESLEY:
Course laid in, sir.

788
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,500
Engage.
