00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:05,750
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46461.3.</i>

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,083
<i>We have arrived at</i>
<i>a communication relay station</i>

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,542
<i>near the Klingon border</i>

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,709
<i>where we are scheduled</i>
<i>to deliver supplies.</i>

5
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:15,417
<i>However, the station has not</i>
<i>responded to repeated hails.</i>

6
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:22,166
(<i> staticky indistinct voices</i> )

7
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,834
CRUSHER:
What's that noise?

8
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,959
They must have left their
audio monitoring system on.

9
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,667
We're hearing a few thousand
subspace messages.

10
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:29,792
I'll try and shut it off.

11
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:40,709
Got it.

12
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,542
(<i> thumping</i> )

13
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:45,291
Geordi, what's that?

14
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,625
I don't know.

15
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,291
Sounds like a loose panel
or something.

16
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:52,166
I think it's coming from
this service duct over here.

17
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,500
Here's your loose panel.

18
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,375
(<i> barks</i> )

19
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,250
Hey, pooch.

20
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,542
Hey, pooch,
come on out of there.

21
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:13,125
Come on.

22
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,667
Come on.

23
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:18,291
Hey, pooch, what are
you doing in there?

24
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,542
Commander,
the shuttlecraft is gone.

25
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,250
There is no one on board.

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,750
CRUSHER:
Commander.

27
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:36,875
What is it?

28
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,667
CRUSHER:
Cellular residue.

29
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,959
I believe these
are the remains

30
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,875
of one of
our lieutenants.

31
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,667
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

32
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:23,709
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

33
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,542
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

34
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:29,500
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

35
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,083
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

36
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:38,083
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

37
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,417
All the blood traces
I found

38
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:52,458
match those of
Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari.

39
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,083
I'll assume
those are her remains

40
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,333
but I need to take
the deckplate

41
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,917
back to sick bay
just to be sure.

42
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,375
It would take a powerful
weapon to do that.

43
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,583
I'll have a better idea

44
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,834
once I've analyzed
the deckplate.

45
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:04,667
If that is Uhnari,
where's Rocha?

46
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,667
The station's
shuttle's gone.

47
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,125
Maybe he took it.

48
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,583
Before Uhnari died
or after?

49
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,417
We're ready, Commander.

50
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,792
You have any luck
downloading the station logs?

51
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,834
Not yet. I can't get past
these security lockouts

52
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,625
and I think I know why.

53
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,125
All encrypted subspace messages
are sent through this channel.

54
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,125
Take a look at this
signal notation.

55
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,041
RIKER:
It's out of sequence.

56
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,208
Looks like somebody
trying to bypass
the access protocols

57
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,792
and break into
the coded messages.

58
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,083
It caused the security
lockouts to freeze right up.

59
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,834
Are there
any messages missing?

60
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:42,709
Well, I won't know until
I get into the files.

61
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:43,875
Looks like
you made a friend.

62
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,083
Yep.

63
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,458
I've got to go back
to the ship.

64
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,875
Let me know as soon
as you have something.

65
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,125
I'm going to try
accessing the logs

66
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,792
from another console.

67
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,959
What's going on here?

68
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:15,458
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Well, we can start with
repolarizing the interface.

69
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,792
(<i> dog barks</i> )

70
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,333
What is it, pup?

71
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,333
What's the matter?

72
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,417
Something over here?

73
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,542
This doesn't look
like it belongs to you.

74
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,750
Ah...

75
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,375
this is what you want, huh?

76
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,333
(<i> barks</i> )

77
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,500
There you go.

78
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,667
Computer, run station logs
in sequence.

79
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,709
WOMAN:
Station log, Stardate 46458.3.

80
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:58,709
Today we configured
the relay controller grid.

81
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:02,083
It was the last primary system
we had to overhaul.

82
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,792
We are scheduled to recalibrate
and align the antennae systems

83
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,333
in the next three days.

84
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,500
Computer,
access visual output.

86
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,917
...sent in my third request
for a message delay buffer.

87
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,875
Until it arrives,
Lieutenant Rocha and I

88
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,542
have rigged a memory module
to compensate.

89
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:20,417
It better work, or about
a half million subspace messages

90
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:23,333
are going to end up drifting
through space.

91
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,166
Computer, open
Uhnari correspondence file.

00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,250
WOMAN:
Hello, Shiana.

98
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,875
Sorry I haven't talked
to you in a while

99
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,375
but I've been dealing with
the new lieutenant, Rocha.

100
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,500
So far he's been rude,
arrogant and condescending

101
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,542
and he's only been here
two days.

102
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,041
This might be a long year.

103
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,333
(<i> static</i> )

104
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,834
Come on, Lieutenant,
stick with me.

105
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,000
I had the dream again.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,834
Mother's calling out
my name.

107
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,291
She's somewhere in the house.

108
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,834
I get to the top
of the hill all right

109
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,750
but then the house
is slanted.

110
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,375
I'm still walking uphill.

111
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,917
I can't find her.

112
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:06,208
Doors everywhere,
and they all look the same.

113
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,500
(<i> static</i> )

114
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,750
The cellular residue
is completely fused

115
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,375
to the metal
of the deckplate.

116
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,458
We're trying to micro-
vaporize the metal

117
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,667
in order to get
a clear DNA sample.

118
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,667
Do you have any idea
what killed her?

119
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,583
Well, this is
just a guess

120
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,000
but from the molecular
deposition of the plating

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,125
I'd say it was caused

122
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,667
by a high-level
phaser blast.

123
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,291
Could it have been
a Klingon disrupter?

124
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,875
Possibly.

125
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,667
Geordi's found evidence
that the encrypted messages

126
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,834
have been
tampered with

127
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,417
and we are close
to Klingon space.

128
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:43,959
There hasn't been
a Klingon raid

129
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,834
against the Federation
for more than seven years.

130
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,375
I don't want to risk
a diplomatic incident

131
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,959
until I have more evidence.

132
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,417
And there's still
the question

133
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,792
of what happened
to Lieutenant Rocha.

134
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,417
Get Rocha's personnel file
from Starfleet Command

135
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:58,750
and ask Starbase 212

136
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,375
if they will help us
to find the shuttle.

137
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,333
Aye, sir.

138
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,542
Keep me apprised, doctor.

139
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:14,375
All right,
let's try this again.

140
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,875
Come on, this
should be working.

141
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,250
The phase inducers
are aligned.

142
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,834
Come on, Lieutenant,
I know you're in here somewhere.

143
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:26,834
Computer, run me
a subsystems diagnostic

144
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:30,875
with a frequency range
of ten to 100 megahertz.

145

146
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,667

149
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,709
What is it, girl?

150
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:05,375
Hello, Shiana.

151
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,875
There you go.

152
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,458
By the time you get this,
the Batarael will be over.

This is the first time
I haven't been there.

154
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,667
I've been wondering.

155
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:17,166
Who's singing the Horath

I had that dream again--

00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,291
the one where Mother
is screaming.

164
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,667
I climb the hill to our house

165
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,709
but I, I can't get to her.

166
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,792
Shiana, this time I ran away.

167
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:05,417
I was so scared
I ran back down the hill.

168
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:10,417
I, I think I know why I've been
having the dreams about danger.

169
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:14,417
It's because of what's been
happening with that Klingon.

170
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:17,500
He's getting more aggressive
all the time.

171
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Not just the usual threat...

(<i> log rewinding</i> )

173
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,625
It's because of what's been
happening with that Klingon.

He's getting more aggressive
all the time.

Not just the usual threat.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,667
Morag actually locked
his disruptors

to the station this time.

178
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,041
I don't think
there'll be any trouble.

00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:45,333
It just... brings up
those feelings of... panic,

180
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:49,417
of wanting to run, wanting
to get away from danger.

181
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:54,709
Shiana, I couldn't say this
to anyone but you

182
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:56,375
but the panic...

183
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:00,583
is the same thing I used to feel
whenever Father got angry,

184
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:05,125
when I knew
he was going to punish me.

185
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:10,250
Only now,
I'm out here in space...

186
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,750
and there's
nowhere to run.

187
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,250
There are three references
to a Commander Morag,

188
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,542
a Klingon officer who patrols
this section of the border.

189
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,166
Apparently, he would pass
by the station

190
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,792
every few days
and harass them.

191
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:26,375
Perhaps this Morag was
the one who was interested

192
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,208
in obtaining
the encrypted messages.

193
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,792
Could be.
She didn't say.

194
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:31,875
But I do have several
more days of logs to watch.

195
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,166
I'm hoping to learn more.

196
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,709
Very well.

197
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,583
In the meantime,
I'll speak with
the Klingon governor

198
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,208
about Commander Morag.

199
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,333
Are you saying we
attacked your outpost?

200
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,250
I'm merely saying
that I'm following up

201
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,208
on evidence that my officers
discovered on board.

202
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,291
Evidence.

203
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,583
So you are making
an accusation.

204
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:04,667
The Klingon empire will not
stand for these kinds of lies.

205
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,625
Governor Torak,
I apologize.

206
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,875
I can see that you
honestly didn't know

207
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,625
what happened
aboard the station.

208
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:15,375
I will just have to take
this matter up with Gowron.

209
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,250
I'm really sorry
that we bothered you.

210
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,709
Gowron won't bother with
such a minor incident.

211
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,542
Well, ordinarily
he wouldn't,

212
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,875
but, of course, I was
his arbiter of succession.

213
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,458
I'm sure that
he will be happy

214
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,375
to come here and
investigate this matter.

215
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,208
You needn't worry about it
any longer.

216
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,041
Gowron will come here?

217
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,542
Oh, yes.

218
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:37,375
So, once again, thank
you for your help.

219
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,250
Oh, I will be sure
to mention your name

220
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,542
to Gowron
when I speak to him.

221
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:45,291
I will investigate
this further, Picard.

222
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,041
You need not
bother Gowron

223
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,125
with this matter.

224
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,792
That's very kind.

225
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,917
<i>Qapla'!</i>

226
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:55,041
<i>Qapla'!</i>

227
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,792
Computer,
access the personal logs

228
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,417
of Aquiel Uhnari.

229
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:10,792
COMPUTER:
Logs accessed.

230
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,792
Begin playback.

231
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,792
Shiana, you always said
I'd look great in a wig

232
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:18,250
so... here it is.

233
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,583
What do you think?

234
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,667
Hmm?

235
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,291
Definitely not you.

236
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:30,083
Okay, maybe I'm getting
a little crazy.

237
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,375
You would, too,

238
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,917
if you were stuck
on a relay station

239
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,291
in the middle of nowhere

240
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,792
with no one for company

241
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,458
except an egomaniac
like Keith Rocha.

242
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,542
I took
a big risk today.

243
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:44,834
I countermanded
an order he gave.

244
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:47,125
I agreed to handle
the com traffic

245
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,375
for relay station 194

246
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,083
while they shut down
for maintenance.

247
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,375
Rocha said we couldn't handle
the additional signal load

248
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,208
but I think he's wrong.

249
00:13:56,208 --> 00:14:00,625
When he finds out,
he'll be furious.

250
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,500
It's days like this
I wish I was home.

251
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:09,125
You know what I miss most?

252
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,166
Muskan seed punch.

253
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,792
Real muskan seed punch.

254
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,625
You can get it
from the replicator

255
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,750
but it's not the same.

256
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,083
I'd give anything

257
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,667
for some of the punch
Mother used to make

258
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:24,000
with chunks of the seed
still in it.

259
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,250
(<i> thumping</i> )

260
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,291
Keith, is that you?

261
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,583
Keith?

262
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,291
(<i> static</i> )

263
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,709
Commander.

264
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,500
There are DNA traces
here-- Klingon.

265
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,000
So Klingons did board
this station.

266
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,041
Yes, but I only found DNA
from one Klingon so far.

267
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,959
I will continue
to scan.

268
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,709
(<i> chuckling</i> )

269
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,208
How could she read
this stuff?

270
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,667
How's it going?

271
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:28,208
I've managed to access all
of Lieutenant Uhnari's logs.

272
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,500
I'm still looking
for Lieutenant Rocha's.

273
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,166
Whatever happened
to the encrypted messages

274
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,417
had a cascade effect
on the whole storage system.

275
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:36,959
I can't find his files
anywhere,

276
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,667
but I'm running a
level-3 diagnostic now.

277
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,542
Well, maybe Rocha didn't
make the official logs.

278
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,667
Uhnari could have been
responsible for them.

279
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:44,792
I don't think so.

280
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,917
Aquiel was
the junior officer here.

281
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,583
Aquiel?

282
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,458
Lieutenant Uhnari.

283
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,500
I've been up all night
watching her personal logs.

284
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,458
I guess I'm starting
to feel like I know her.

285
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,333
What was she like?

286
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,041
Well, she was Haliian.

287
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,792
She had one sister
named Shiana.

288
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:05,125
She drank
muskan seed punch.

289
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:09,250
She... had
a quirky sense of humor.

290
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,583
She liked to sing.

291
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:15,417
She... had questionable
taste in literature.

292
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:18,083
PICARD:
<i>Enterprise</i> to Commander Riker.

293
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,750
Riker here.

294
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,959
The Klingon ship<i> Qu'vat</i> 
has arrived with
Governor Torak.

295
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,417
Please report
to the observation lounge.

296
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,542
We're on our way.

297
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,041
Governor Torak, sir.

298
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,208
Governor, welcome aboard.

299
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,709
Do not bore me
with your human pleasantries.

300
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,583
I told you
we did not kill the woman.

301
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,166
Now I will prove it to you.

302
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,417
<i>Ghos!</i>

303
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:08,041
This is Lieutenant
Aquiel Uhnari.

304
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,792
We were running
a level-2 diagnostic

305
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,709
of the message buffer--
nothing special.

306
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:31,417
Rocha had been on edge
all morning,

307
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,583
but he'd been irritable
ever since he got there

308
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,000
so I didn't think
anything of it.

309
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,875
We were halfway
through the procedure

310
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,875
when suddenly he...
attacked me.

311
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,542
He grabbed me, threw me
against a bulkhead.

312
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:47,250
I yelled at him to stop,
but he wouldn't listen.

313
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,875
He took me by the throat.

314
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,166
I broke free and tried to get
to the weapons locker.

315
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,291
I'm not sure
what happened next

316
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,583
but somehow, I got aboard
the shuttle and left.

317
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,875
We found her
on our side of the border

318
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,750
heading toward
sector 2520.

319
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,500
She is lucky my patrol ship

320
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,959
did not destroy her vessel
on sight.

321
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,333
Lieutenant...

322
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:13,583
why didn't you
contact Starfleet?

323
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,333
Let them know
what had happened

324
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,792
on board the station?

325
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,458
I don't know, sir.

326
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,959
Maybe I passed out.

327
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:22,208
I'm not even sure how long
I was on the shuttle

328
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,000
before the Klingons
picked me up.

329
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,500
46 hours. You've been
gone 46 hours.

330
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,583
We presumed you were dead.

331
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,208
Your bloodstains were
found at the murder scene.

332
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,417
I must have cut my head

333
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,333
when he pushed me
against the bulkhead.

334
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,542
Then the remains
we found

335
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,208
must be those of
Lieutenant Rocha.

336
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,500
I can't confirm that.

337
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,583
Until we're able
to separate

338
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,959
the cellular residue
from the deckplate

339
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,000
I won't be able to do
a clear DNA scan.

340
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,625
You said you were trying
to get to the weapons locker.

341
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,041
Is there a possibility
that you did?

342
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,750
No, I... didn't.

343
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,125
You're sure?

344
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:01,166
I don't remember
exactly what happened to me

345
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,959
after I was attacked.

346
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,667
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:10,667
It's as if all my memories
were drained out of me.

348
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,458
Your log said
that a Commander Morag

349
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,000
had been harassing you.

350
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,542
Did you let him
or any other Klingon

351
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:16,667
onto the station?

352
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,166
Absolutely not.

353
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,542
If that is true, then Morag
or some other Klingon

354
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:24,375
must have boarded the
station after she left.

355
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,917
We found traces
of Klingon DNA

356
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,291
on the station.

357
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,000
You still try to blame us!

358
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,625
Have the courage to
admit your mistakes.

359
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,959
Or are you a<i> lo'be vos?</i>

360
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:40,375
At least I do not wear
the uniform of the<i> petaQ!</i>

361
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,542
Governor, we're
merely exploring
all the possibilities.

362
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:44,875
Lieutenant Uhnari's logs

363
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,667
reported that
Commander Morag

364
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,750
had been harassing
the station.

365
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,625
He was doing his job.

366
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,542
If he was only
doing his job

367
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:54,250
then I'm sure
you would not mind

368
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,959
if we spoke with him.

369
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:59,083
Very well.

370
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,125
In the interests
of diplomacy

371
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,625
I will allow you
to speak to Morag

372
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,542
but my patience
has limits!

373
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,291
Lieutenant, I know
a friend of yours

374
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,291
who's very eager
to see you.

375
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,417
Who?

376
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,250
Come with me.

377
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,291
(<i> barks</i> )

378
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,458
Maura! Come here, girl!

379
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,291
Come on, Maura!

380
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,959
Maura! That's
the name, huh?

381
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:34,250
Yes, it's from
<i>Cold Moon Over Blackwater.</i>

382
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,417
Have you read it?

383
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,375
I'm not much
for Gothic fiction.

384
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,041
Well, not many people
are, nowadays.

385
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,709
Oh, your shoe.

386
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,667
Uh, yeah. Maura got
a little restless.

387
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,500
Maura, shame on you.

388
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,792
That's not like you.
What a naughty dog.

389
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,792
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

390
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,625
At least she's
chewing them up in pairs.

391
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,166
I'll arrange
quarters for you.

392
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,083
I'm sure you want
some time alone.

393
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,458
Well, actually, I've been
stuck on that station

394
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,041
for over nine months.

395
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,667
I wouldn't mind going
someplace with some activity.

396
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:13,125
I know just the place.

397
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,083
There you are, sir.

398
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,291
Thank you.

399
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,542
You're welcome.

400
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,000
Ah!

401
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,041
Mmm! Oh.

402
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,709
Have you ever tried
muskan seed punch?

403
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,792
Uh... it nearly
made me sick.

404
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,709
You have
to be raised on it.

405
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:40,375
It's very nutritious.

406
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,959
The taste
grows on you.

407
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:45,583
<i>Batar al nalia.</i>

408
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,875
You speak Haliian?

409
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,917
We traveled around
quite a bit

410
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:52,333
while I was growing up.

411
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,500
I picked up a couple of
languages along the way.

412
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,959
Hmm.
We never traveled.

413
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:59,959
My family lived
in the same house

414
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,417
for five generations.

415
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:03,208
Mm-hmm.
The one on the hill.

416
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,500
How do you know
about that?

417
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

418
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:12,417
Well, to be honest, when
we thought you were dead

419
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:16,792
I needed to review your logs
and personal correspondence

420
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:21,125
for any possible clues
about what happened.

421
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,750
All of it?

422
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,709
Most of it, yeah.

423
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,667
You... you need
to understand

424
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:47,208
that we thought
you'd been murdered.

425
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,709
We needed information.

426
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:52,417
I'm sorry.

427
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:57,000
It's just that
I tell my sister

428
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,208
things I wouldn't
tell anyone else.

429
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:07,625
I guess I was feeling
a little... exposed.

430
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,667
I'd feel the same way.

431
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:18,625
Especially if I had
seen<i> you</i> in that wig.

432
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,750
(<i> laughing</i> )

433
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,792
It really wasn't you.

434
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,667
I'm curious.

435
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,625
Now that you've met me,

436
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,375
am I what you expected?

437
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,375
Hmm...

438
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:40,291
actually, I'm...
I'm not sure.

439
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,875
The woman I saw on those logs
is very complicated.

440
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,291
I think
there's more to you

441
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,917
than meets the eye,
Lieutenant.

442
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,542
In what way?

443
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:52,959
Well, your relationship with
Lieutenant Rocha, for example.

444
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:55,041
He was only there
for five days

445
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:58,583
and yet there was evidence
of plenty of friction.

446
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,166
And you seemed to delight

447
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:04,083
in doing things that...
you knew would upset him.

448
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,834
Why take on
extra com traffic

449
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:08,834
when you knew it was
going to make him angry?

450
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:11,083
Is this
a personal question

451
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,792
or part of a murder
investigation?

452
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:16,750
I don't know.

453
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,792
Maybe both.

454
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,250
Keith Rocha was obnoxious

455
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,417
from the minute
he reported to duty.

456
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:30,125
He treated me as though
I was beneath contempt.

457
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:34,792
I felt like
I had to battle him
to hold my own

458
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:38,333
but I didn't want
to see him dead.

459
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,291
Why do you think
he attacked you?

460
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:46,834
I don't know.

461
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,542
Rocha's file is spotless.

462
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,417
Two decorations for valor,

463
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:57,875
three outstanding evaluations
from his previous commanders.

464
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,875
It doesn't sound
like the same man

465
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,125
that Lieutenant Uhnari
described.

466
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,291
What did you find
out about Uhnari?

467
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,750
I checked into
her record, too.

468
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,709
Her last posting
was on Deriben V.

469
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:08,583
I spoke to her
commanding officer.

470
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,458
He said she was
argumentative,

471
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,875
quick to take offense.

472
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:13,083
He also told me

473
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,208
he transferred her
to that relay station

474
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,792
because she was
"hampering their efforts."

475
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,917
To be honest,
I'm having trouble
believing her story, sir.

476
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,375
Why?

477
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,959
I sent Worf to check
the weapons locker

478
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,834
on the relay station.

479
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,333
There's a phaser missing.

480
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,333
You think that she lied?

481
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:34,208
Lied, conveniently forgot--
I'm not sure.

482
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,500
I think it's something
we have to consider.

483
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,875
As of now we don't have
sufficient evidence,
one way or the other.

484
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:42,250
I want you
to examine her shuttle.

485
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,583
You might find
something there

486
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,875
that will shed some light on her
story.

487
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,250
Aye, sir.

488
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,917
How much longer do you think
the investigation will take?

489
00:25:57,917 --> 00:25:59,417
Three, maybe four days.

490
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:00,875
It's tough to tell.

491
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:03,250
I know I'm a suspect
in the murder.

492
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,083
Let me ask you something.

493
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,709
You've watched my logs.

494
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:08,875
You know me better
than anyone here.

495
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,083
Do I seem like
the kind of person

496
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,709
who would murder someone?

497
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,667
No, you don't.

498
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:23,291
I don't think I realized
how much I needed to hear that.

499
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,542
Look, Aquiel, it's been
a rough couple of days.

500
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:28,500
I think
you need some sleep.

501
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,917
You called me complicated.

502
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:41,583
You're right.

503
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,792
I don't make
friends easily.

504
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,667
<i>Oumriel.</i>

505
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,583
<i>Oumriel.</i>

506
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:15,834
Commander.

507
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,583
It is set to kill.

508
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,750
We found this type-2 phaser
in your shuttlecraft.

509
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,250
It was taken from
the weapons locker
on the station.

510
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,667
I told you I don't
remember what happened.

511
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:37,750
Maybe I did make it
to the weapons locker.

512
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,542
It was set
to level ten.

513
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:41,625
Standard procedure
requires that all phasers

514
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:43,542
are set on level one when
they're put in storage.

515
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:44,917
That means that somebody

516
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:46,834
deliberately changed
the setting.

517
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,083
And then there's the matter

518
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,875
of your conflict
with Lieutenant Rocha.

519
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:54,041
Rocha and I
had our disagreements

520
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:56,166
but that does not mean
I would kill him.

521
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,667
Have you been
able to remember

522
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:59,583
anything that happened
after he attacked you?

523
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,583
No.

524
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:03,917
Nothing.

525
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:07,709
I suppose, maybe
in self-defense, I...

526
00:28:07,709 --> 00:28:09,458
Dr. Crusher tells me
that in order to inflict

527
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:12,542
the type of molecular damage
found in Rocha's remains,

528
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:14,542
it would take a sustained
phaser discharge

529
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,625
of at least
30 to 40 seconds.

530
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,834
That doesn't sound like
self-defense to me.

531
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:21,125
Now, wait a minute.

532
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,583
We haven't even
established

533
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,458
this phaser is
the murder weapon yet.

534
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,792
And even at level ten,
I don't see

535
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:26,959
how it could have
done the damage

536
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,542
the medical evidence
says it did.

537
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,625
A phase disrupter
like a Klingon weapon,
maybe...

538
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,625
Look, we're not here
to make accusations.

539
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,792
We're trying to find out
what happened.

540
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:36,875
Commander Morag is
due here in two hours.

541
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:37,834
Let's see
what he has to say.

542
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:39,250
Fine.
In the meantime

543
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,834
I'd like to go back
down to the station

544
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:42,959
and see if I can access
Rocha's personal logs again.

545
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,125
Good idea.

546
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,667
Geordi, wait a second.

547
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:57,959
Thank you, Mr. Worf.

548
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,208
Aye, sir.

549
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,709
This is off the record.

550
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:07,458
I'm saying this to you
as a friend,

551
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,333
not your superior officer.

552
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,208
I think it would be best

553
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,667
if you weren't
so personally involved

554
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,000
with Aquiel right now.

555
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,291
There's a lot about her
we don't know.

556
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:16,917
And there's a lot
about her that I do know

557
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:19,125
and if she's innocent
I want to help
her prove it.

558
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:23,375
I think you've let
your personal feelings
cloud your judgment.

559
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,667
I'm not the one
making judgments.

560
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,583
Got it.

561
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:44,375
Computer, display the personal
records of Lieutenant Rocha

562
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,959
from Stardates 46455
to 46460.

563
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,709
Computer, what happened
to the log entries

564
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:57,792
for Stardate 46459?

565
00:29:57,792 --> 00:29:59,917
COMPUTER:
The logs have been deleted.

566
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:01,750
Who deleted them?

567
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,792
COMPUTER:
Unknown.

568
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,709
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

569
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:10,291
<i>The</i> Qu'vat<i> has arrived</i>
<i>with Commander Morag.</i>

570
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,083
<i>We are preparing</i>
<i>to question him</i>

571
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,417
<i>regarding his involvement</i>

572
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,333
<i>in the murder</i>
<i>of Lieutenant Rocha.</i>

573
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,792
I killed no one!

574
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:20,083
We found your DNA on
the bulkheads and the console.

575
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,667
We know you were there.

576
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:23,959
Answer
their questions.

577
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,583
Yes...
yes, I was there.

578
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,333
My patrol route
takes me

579
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,417
near the station
every six days.

580
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,917
Three days ago,
I hailed them.

581
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,792
There was no response.

582
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:41,375
I was... concerned.

583
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,500
Concerned.
MORAG: Yes.

584
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,375
I went aboard to see
what had happened.

585
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:48,166
There was no one there,
so I left.

586
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:49,125
Is that all?

587
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,333
That's all.

588
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,333
Commander Morag,

589
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,250
we have discovered that
the encrypted message bank

590
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,792
on the station
has been tampered with.

591
00:30:56,792 --> 00:31:00,667
Our analysis indicates that 27
priority Starfleet messages

592
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:01,792
are missing.

593
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:02,959
What of it?

594
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,291
Your DNA was also found

595
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,959
on the message
control module.

596
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,458
This is outrageous!

597
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:09,208
We will not tolerate
these ridiculous accusations.

598
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:12,083
TORAK:
This is a diplomatic
matter, Morag!

599
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:17,291
Do not make me
search your ship.

600
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:28,917
Yes...

601
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:32,291
I did take
the messages.

602
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,083
Did you kill
Lieutenant Rocha?

603
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,959
No, I killed no one.

604
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,083
There was no one there.

605
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:41,500
I took the codes,
but I killed no one.

606
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,000
Governor, we would like
Commander Morag

607
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,291
to remain on board
the<i> Enterprise</i>

608
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:48,750
until this investigation
is completed.

609
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:53,333
Take him.

610
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,583
This way.

611
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:11,000
Last night,
after I dropped you off
at your quarters

612
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,625
you established a subspace
link with this console.

613
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:17,625
You deleted some of Rocha's
personal files, didn't you?

614
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:20,959
Yes.

615
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:21,959
I did.

616
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,208
Why?

617
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:28,250
I found a letter
Rocha was planning to send
to Starfleet Command about me.

618
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,542
The letter said I had become
belligerent and insubordinate.

619
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:36,667
He was going to ask
for a formal hearing.

620
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,959
Geordi, I know
how this looks.

621
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,709
Yeah, it looks bad.

622
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,500
I find out that
you've erased a letter

623
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,750
that contained a possible
motivation for murder...

624
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,792
I didn't kill him!

625
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:48,625
Then<i> explain</i> this.

626
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,542
I was afraid that
if they found the letter

627
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:56,792
they'd blame me
for the murder.

628
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm not a model officer.

629
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,375
I realize that.

630
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,792
Sometimes
I act on impulse

631
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:05,583
instead of
thinking things through.

632
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:16,417
Aquiel... this really
complicates things.

633
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:31,709
What are you doing?

634
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,333
Getting out of here.

635
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,208
Aquiel, running away
isn't going to prove
your innocence.

636
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:37,583
Facing the situation will.

637
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,792
I'm scared, Geordi.

638
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:41,667
Look, we'll get
through this.

639
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,500
I promise you, okay?

640
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,792
Then you believe me?

641
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,458
Yes, I do.

642
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:07,875
<i>Medical officer's log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

643
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:10,458
<i>I've isolated the cellular</i>
<i>residue from the deckplate,</i>

644
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,375
<i>but the DNA</i>
<i>has destabilized.</i>

645
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,208
<i>I'm attempting to reform it.</i>

646
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:17,583
All right, initiate
the resonance frequency burst.

647
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm beginning to get
a stable DNA scan.

648
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,917
This is odd.

649
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:44,291
The nucleotide sequences
are beginning to fluctuate.

650
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,375
The DNA is becoming motile.

651
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:50,792
Let's try another
frequency burst,

652
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:54,125
but increase
the resonance level
by 20%.

653
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:24,625
I haven't been this
close to someone

654
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,291
in a long time.

655
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:30,375
I don't want
to let go of it.

656
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,709
Neither do I, but...

657
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:35,625
we've got 600 logs
to go through.

658
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,208
All right.

659
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:43,000
But first there's
something I want
to share with you.

660
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,625
What?

661
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:48,875
A way that we can
become more intimate.

662
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:53,709
My people are
partially telepathic.

663
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:56,417
We use something
called the canar

664
00:35:56,417 --> 00:35:59,959
to help focus
our thoughts.

665
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,750
We also use the canar

666
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:07,834
for a stronger emotional
link during love.

667
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:14,333
I was wondering
what that was for.

668
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:17,375
Do both of us
have to be telepathic
for it to work?

669
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,625
Let's find out.

670
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:39,041
Like this.

671
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,625
Think of me.

672
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:04,375
It's an exact
reproduction of my hand,

673
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:06,542
right down to
the DNA structure.

674
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:08,083
Doctor, you said
that this was formed

675
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,458
from the organic matter
taken from the deckplates.

676
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:12,083
When I infused
the matter

677
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,792
with a resonance
frequency burst

678
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:15,709
it activated its DNA.

679
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,125
Then it touched my hand

680
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:20,083
and it began to mimic
my cellular structure.

681
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:24,959
Doctor,
what exactly is this?

682
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:27,959
This is going to sound
very far-fetched,

683
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:31,750
but have you ever heard
of a coalescent organism?

684
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,917
No.

685
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,041
They're rare
microscopic life-forms

686
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,917
which need to absorb
other organisms

687
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:38,166
in order to survive.

688
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,875
Now, that in itself
isn't so unusual,

689
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:42,750
but coalescents
become the organisms

690
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,959
they've absorbed--

691
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:46,250
right down to
the cellular level.

692
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,166
Do you think this is what
happened with your hand?

693
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,917
There have been reports

694
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:52,333
that these organisms can
exist on a larger scale.

695
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,834
Certainly what
happened to my hand

696
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,125
seems to support
that theory.

697
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,500
RIKER:
So you think that Rocha

698
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,125
was killed by one
of these organisms?

699
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,458
It's possible that
something happened to him

700
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,834
before he reported for duty
on the relay station.

701
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,709
I do not understand.

702
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:06,166
I've checked
the records.

703
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,375
Before he was posted
to the relay station

704
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:11,542
Rocha served on an outpost
in the Triona system.

705
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,709
Now, that is
a remote sector.

706
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,041
Maybe he was absorbed

707
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:17,125
by a coalescent
during that mission.

708
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,542
So, what boarded the station

709
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:20,208
could have been
an organism that looked

710
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,458
and acted like
Lieutenant Rocha.

711
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,041
How often do they
have to change bodies?

712
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:27,000
The microscopic organisms

713
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,667
have a cycle of no more
than five to ten seconds.

714
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:31,959
We can only assume

715
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:34,709
that a larger,
more complex coalescent

716
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:37,375
would have a cycle
of days...

717
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:38,583
even weeks.

718
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,500
Doctor, if what
you're saying is true

719
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,583
then Rocha attacked
Lieutenant Uhnari

720
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:43,750
to find a new body.

721
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,959
Right.

722
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,917
That means Uhnari
is a coalescent.

723
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:51,333
There was one other person
on the station--

724
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,709
Morag.

725
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:55,458
It is possible
he was the one who was...

726
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,000
absorbed.

727
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,417
Computer, locate Commander Morag
and Lieutenant Uhnari.

728
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:02,959
COMPUTER:
Commander Morag
is in his quarters.

729
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:06,333
Lieutenant Uhnari is not
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

730
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,375
Where did she go?

731
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:12,250
COMPUTER:
Lieutenant Uhnari transported
to relay station 47

732
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,667
at 1830 hours.

733
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:17,083
You get Morag.
I'm going to the station.

734
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,709
WORF:
Aye, sir.

735
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:30,333
(<i> exhaling</i> )

736
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,125
Geordi?

737
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:35,417
I can see you.

738
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,625
Oh...

739
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:43,834
and I can... feel you.

740
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:46,834
(<i> breathing deeply</i> )

741
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:50,875
Do not move.

742
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,041
What is this?

743
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,250
You will come with me.

744
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:07,709
You've never been
as close to someone

745
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,959
as you are about to be.

746
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,959
Think of me.

747
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:15,709
(<i> door opening</i> )

748
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,291
Step away from him,
Lieutenant.

749
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,250
What are you doing,
Commander?

750
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,417
That may not be
Lieutenant Uhnari.

751
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:28,542
What?

752
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:30,041
What are you saying?

753
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,750
Step away... now.

754
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:39,750
<i>Medical officer's log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

755
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,792
<i>Commander Morag</i>
<i>and Lieutenant Uhnari</i>

756
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:44,500
<i>are being kept</i>
<i>under close observation.</i>

757
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,041
<i>So far, no sign of coalescent</i>
<i>behavior has surfaced.</i>

758
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:49,834
Aquiel and Morag
will be transferred

759
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:52,041
to a secure medical facility
on Starbase 12.

760
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,166
Maybe we'll know more
by the time we get there.

761
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:56,333
Yeah. Right.

762
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:57,792
It could be Morag.

763
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,959
We don't know
for sure.

764
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,583
Sure.

765
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:04,500
Get some rest.

766
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,458
You've had a rough
couple of days.

767
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,417
Thanks.

768
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,709
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

769
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:15,458
(<i> sighs</i> )

770
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,166
Computer...

771
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:26,417
display the engineering duty
roster for the next three days.

772
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,792
(<i> growling playfully</i> )

773
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:43,000
Maura, come on.
Not now.

774
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,709
Maura, I said not now.

775
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:46,625
Come on,
give me a break here!

776
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,834
Not...!

777
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:49,417
Go lay down!

778
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:58,583
(<i> resonant growl</i> )

779
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,792
Maura?

780
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:20,500
(<i> roaring</i> )

781
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:36,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

782
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:43,000
LA FORGE:
Maybe the reason
you don't remember

783
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,709
anything that happened
after Rocha attacked you

784
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:47,208
is that the coalescing
process had begun.

785
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:51,125
Thank you.

786
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:53,792
Remember when you said
you felt like the memories

787
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:55,875
had been drained
right out of you?

788
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,041
Well, that's probably

789
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,041
exactly what
was going on.

790
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:01,125
Then maybe I did
take the phaser.

791
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,375
Well, whatever happened,
at least you got away

792
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,291
before the process
took hold.

793
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,959
So, he turned on Maura.

794
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:10,458
Right.

795
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,875
Well...

796
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,291
what now?

797
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:21,834
I guess I'll be going
to Starbase 212
for reassignment.

798
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:23,125
You know,
I had a conversation

799
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,125
with Chief Pendleton
in communications

800
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:28,041
and there's an opening
for a level-2 specialist.

801
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,458
Really?

802
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:33,125
Oh, I'm sure
the waiting list is so long

803
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,875
I'd be gray
before I got here.

804
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:37,458
I could put in
a good word.

805
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:40,834
It's an appealing offer,

806
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:44,500
but I think I'd rather
get here on my own merits.

807
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:51,875
Don't be surprised if you
see my name on that list.
