00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:15,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45233.1.</i>

2
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,959
<i>Our terraforming mission</i>
<i>to Doraf One has been cancelled</i>

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,542
<i>and the</i> Enterprise<i> recalled</i>
<i>to Starbase 234.</i>

4
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,333
<i>Fleet Admiral Brackett</i>
<i>would not discuss the matter</i>

5
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:29,583
<i>on subspace for reasons</i>
<i>she said would soon be clear.</i>

6
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:33,333
I apologize, Captain,
for the mystery,
but we must attempt

7
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,083
to contain the information
I'm about to reveal to you

8
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,959
at least as long as possible.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,875
I must admit, you've piqued
my curiosity, Admiral.

10
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:44,792
Three weeks ago,
one of our most
celebrated ambassadors--

11
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:48,583
an advisor to
Federation leaders for
generations-- disappeared.

12
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:52,375
He left no word
of his destination.

13
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,917
Two days ago, intelligence
reports placed him on Romulus,

14
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:59,667
and I assure you, it was
an unauthorized visit.

15
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:02,458
Computer, initiate linkage
between this terminal

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,583
and Starbase computer
system Alpha 29.

17
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,875
Linkage complete.
A defection?

18
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:13,834
If it is, the damage
to Federation security
would be immeasurable.

19
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,250
Taken on Romulus
by long-range scanner.

20
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:21,583
Computer, enhance image
in section four Delta.

21
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:08,041
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

22
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:12,625
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

23
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

24
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:18,041
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

25
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:22,375
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

26
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:27,166
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

27
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,709
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45236.4.</i>

28
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,917
<i>As I study</i>
<i>the intelligence reports</i>

29
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,834
<i>on Ambassador Spock's</i>
<i>disappearance,</i>

30
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,542
<i>I cannot help but feel</i>
<i>a deeper,</i>

31
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,667
<i>more personal concern</i>
<i>about this mission,</i>

32
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,542
<i>for I know this man</i>
<i>through his father.</i>

33
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:44,208
<i>It was barely a year ago</i>
<i>that I shared a mind meld</i>
<i>with the Vulcan Sarek.</i>

34
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,375
<i>Now we must meet again</i>
<i>as I attempt to find</i>

35
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:49,667
<i>an explanation</i>
<i>for his son's actions.</i>

36
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,875
We're coming into orbit
of Vulcan in less than
an hour, Captain.

37
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:55,709
We should tell
Sarek's wife of our plans.

38
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,125
It's already been
taken care of.

39
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,458
She's transporting over
at 0700.

40
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,834
And Sarek?

41
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:05,583
She says he's too ill to
make the trip with her.

42
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:10,542
The man is dying, and it's
my honor to tell him

43
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,792
that his son may have
betrayed the Federation.

44
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,875
How well
do you know Spock?

45
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,959
I only met him once.

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,542
What I know of him
comes from history books

47
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,250
and, of course, my
mind meld with his father.

48
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,041
Well that must
cover a lot of ground.

49
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,709
Not as much
as you would imagine.

50
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,917
Sarek and Spock...

51
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,792
well...

52
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:36,166
sometimes fathers
and sons...

53
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,417
Understood.

54
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:42,375
Oh, one other thing.

55
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,834
Take a look at this.

56
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,917
Turned up during
an intelligence sweep.

57
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,792
Metal fragments.
What do you make of it?

58
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,417
Possibly, disassembled
components identified
as Vulcan

59
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,667
recovered from
a downed Ferengi vessel?

60
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,041
They were found in crates
marked "medical supplies."

61
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,333
Contraband?

62
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,500
It's been sent to Vulcan
for identification.

63
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:02,542
Starfleet have requested
that we lend a hand.

64
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:21,542
Mint tea. It's been years
since I've had any.

65
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:25,625
Vulcans have some kind
of strange concoction
they call mint.

66
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,875
You'd never recognize it.

67
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:32,291
Perrin, do you know why
I've come to Vulcan?

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,750
I must talk to you
about Spock.

69
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:45,208
He didn't even say good-bye
to his father before he left.

70
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,250
Is it possible he could
have been abducted?

71
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:53,208
No. He wrapped up all
of his affairs carefully.

72
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,792
He knew he was going.

73
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,291
Do you have any idea

74
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:03,500
why he might have
disappeared like this?

75
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:06,959
Captain,
as far as I'm concerned,

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,542
he disappeared
a long time ago.

77
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,959
Would it
be inappropriate

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,417
to ask what happened
between you and Spock?

79
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,250
Not between us.

80
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,166
Between Spock
and his father.

81
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:22,417
Oh, they had argued for
years, that was family,

82
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:26,291
but when the debates over
the Cardassian War began,

83
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:31,333
he attacked Sarek's
position publicly.

84
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,375
He showed no loyalty
for his father.

85
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:38,083
I was not aware that
Sarek was offended
by Spock's opposition.

86
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,917
<i>I</i> was offended.

87
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,542
I made sure
that Spock knew it.

88
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,458
I'm very protective
of my husband.

89
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,250
I do not apologize
for it.

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,083
Does Sarek have any idea
why Spock might have left?

91
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:02,750
I don't know.

92
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:06,166
If you could see Sarek
as I do--

93
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:11,291
wasting in bed,
whispering to himself...

94
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,250
He wants to see his son.

95
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:20,792
He wants to heal any rift
that may still remain.

96
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:31,792
Now it may be too late.

97
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,083
Perrin...

98
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,583
would you allow me
to see Sarek?

99
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:53,917
If it were anyone else,
I would never permit it,

100
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,375
but you are a part of him
and he of you.

101
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,291
The Vulcans
haven't figured out
what these fragments are,

102
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,917
but they've determined
that the metal
is a dentarium alloy.

103
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,250
Well, that pretty well
indicates that they're Vulcan.

104
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,458
Dentarium also means
that whatever this was,

105
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,208
it was originally designed
for use in space.

106
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,667
From the look of the
damage, it must have been
a high-speed impact.

107
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:21,208
Yeah, a Ferengi cargo
ship that went down the
Hanolin asteroid belt.

108
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,959
The debris was spread
over 100 square kilometers.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,333
Could it be
a weapons array?

110
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,750
That was my first thought,
but the Vulcans

111
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,291
have no record
of any stolen weapons

112
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,667
or stolen parts,
for that matter.

113
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,959
This is going to be
like putting together
a big jigsaw puzzle

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,417
when you don't even
know what the picture
is supposed to be.

115
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,709
Yep.

116
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:43,291
(<i> grunting and moaning</i> )

117
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,542
He is like this
most of the time.

118
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,583
His emotions
have taken over.

119
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:11,125
Sometimes I can
bring him out of it.

120
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,750
Sarek!

121
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,500
You will listen.

122
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:18,417
Go from me.

123
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,792
Picard is here.

124
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:24,125
No more chaos.

125
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,917
No more.

126
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,458
I will leave you
alone with him.

127
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,709
He will either acknowledge
you or he won't.

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,041
Sarek...

129
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:52,250
I've come a long way
to see you.

130
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,667
I will not answer.

131
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,875
I must talk to you
about your son.

132
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,667
I wish no one with me.

133
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,959
About Spock.

134
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,375
Spock?

135
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,917
Yes.

136
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,917
He's missing.

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,250
Is that you?

138
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,166
Picard?

139
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,208
Hello, old friend.

140
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,083
You are here, on Vulcan.

141
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,667
I need your help.

142
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,750
I must find Spock.

143
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,250
He's not here.

144
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,625
I know.

145
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:45,417
He's been reported
on Romulus.

146
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,083
Romulus?

147
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,041
Yes.

148
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,375
Why?

149
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:58,166
I had hoped to find
that out from you.

150
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,709
On Romulus?

151
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,041
You're going there,
aren't you?

152
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,000
To find him.

153
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,667
Yes.

154
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,625
Do you have any idea
what might have taken
him to Romulus?

155
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,542
No.

156
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:32,500
Is there anyone
on Romulus he might know
or choose to contact?

157
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,834
Pardek?

158
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,291
Who is Pardek?

159
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,917
It could be Pardek.

160
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,542
Who is Pardek?

161
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,959
He is a Romulan senator.

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Spock has maintained
a relationship with him
over the years.

163
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,750
I don't know how they met.

164
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:58,959
At the Khitomer conference,
I'd imagine.

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,375
Pardek represented Romulus?

166
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,959
Yes.
I'm sure he did.

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,333
In fact, I recall

168
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:11,375
Spock coming to me
with optimism

169
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:16,291
about maintaining
a continual dialogue
with the Romulans.

170
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:21,333
I told him that it was
illogical to maintain
such an expectation.

171
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,458
Spock was always
so impressionable.

172
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,583
This Romulan Pardek
had no support at home.

173
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,583
Of course, in the end,
I was proven correct.

174
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:37,750
I gave Spock the benefit
of experience, of logic.

175
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:42,834
He never listened.
He never listened.

176
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:47,333
It has been suggested that
Spock might have defected.

177
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:51,166
Never.

178
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:55,875
I will accept many things,
but never that.

179
00:12:55,917 --> 00:13:01,375
But you believe
he might have gone
there to see Pardek?

180
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:04,792
The Romulan senator?

181
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,250
How do you know Pardek?

182
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,917
I've heard of him.

183
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,792
That's what he's done.

184
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:19,375
He's gone to see Pardek.

185
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,709
Do you know what business
they might have together?

186
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,583
No. I never knew
what Spock was doing.

187
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,458
When he was a boy,
he would disappear for
days into the mountains.

188
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,709
I would ask him where he
had gone, what he had done.

189
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,250
He refused to tell me.

190
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,750
I insisted that he tell me.
He would not.

191
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:39,875
I forbade him to go.
He ignored me.

192
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:44,125
I punished him.
He endured it silently.

193
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,750
But always, he returned
to the mountains.

194
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,458
One might as well ask
the river not to run.

195
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,041
But secretly,
I admired him--

196
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:58,500
the proud core of him
that would not yield.

197
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:12,458
Sarek, we're a part
of each other.

198
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,375
I know that he
has caused you pain,

199
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:20,417
but I also know
that you love him.

200
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:29,291
Tell him, Picard...

201
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,959
Peace and long life.

202
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,875
Live long and...

203
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,208
and...

204
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,625
Live long and...

205
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,792
(<i> sobbing</i> )

206
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,792
Spock...

207
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:18,375
my son...

208
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,041
And prosper.

209
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,125
<i>Captain's Log:</i>
<i>Stardate 45240.1.</i>

210
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,625
<i>To cross the neutral zone,</i>
<i>I will require a cloaked ship.</i>

211
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:46,000
<i>To that end, I have</i>
<i>set a course for the</i>
<i>Klingon home world.</i>

212
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,041
<i>After all we did for Gowron</i>
<i>during the recent war,</i>

213
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,458
<i>I'm certain he will be</i>
<i>happy to return a favor.</i>

214
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,875
Still no response from
the Klingons, Mr. Worf?

215
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,583
No, sir.
He's ignoring me.

216
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,000
What other
explanation is there?

217
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,709
It seems after hailing him
for three days,

218
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,250
he could have found
a minute to talk to you.

219
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,208
Sir.
Yes, lieutenant?

220
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,959
I believe I know
why our messages are
not being answered.

221
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,542
Gowron has been rewriting
Klingon history.

222
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,917
Rewriting history?

223
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,291
Yes. He is claiming
that it was his courage,

224
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,750
his genius that brought
an end to the civil war.

225
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,208
I see.

226
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,625
In the new version,
there is no mention made

227
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,917
of the Federation's help
in his rise to power.

228
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,125
If Worf's right, then
our arrival will be

229
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,834
an uncomfortable
reminder of the facts.

230
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,417
Well, he can take all
the credit he wants.

231
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,875
I don't care,
but I do need a ship.

232
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:34,458
Well, if Gowron won't
talk to me, get me
somebody who will--

233
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,792
somebody on the high
council-- K'tal perhaps.

234
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:41,000
Yes, sir.
Captain, I have a
visual identification

235
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,333
of Senator Pardek
of Romulus.

236
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,166
This is a Barolian record
of a trade negotiation

237
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:51,542
in which Pardek participated
four years ago.

238
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,083
That's all?

239
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,250
Yes, sir.
Run it again.

240
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,625
PICARD:
Computer, freeze.

241
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:07,000
Call up the intelligence
scan of Spock on Romulus.

242
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:11,417
PICARD:
Computer, enhance
far left figure and compare.

243
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,709
Same man-- Pardek.

244
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,750
One question answered.

245
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:18,709
What do we know of him?

246
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,542
He has been in
public service since
he was a young man.

247
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,583
A senator
for nine decades.

248
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,917
He is considered
a man of the people.

249
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,083
He has sponsored
many reforms.

250
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:32,083
Reportedly, Romulan
leadership considers him
to be somewhat of a radical

251
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,125
because he has been
an advocate of peace
throughout his career.

252
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:40,709
I can see why Spock
would cultivate
a relationship with him.

253
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,583
Where would we find him
other than on the floor
of the Romulan Senate?

254
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:48,041
The district he
represents is called
the Krocton segment.

255
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,625
He maintains
a dwelling there.

256
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,750
Thank you, Mr. Data.

257
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:56,375
There is more, sir.
I have taken the liberty

258
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,709
of expanding the
parameters of my search

259
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,667
and have discovered that
Pardek has several relatives

260
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,417
in the Krocton segment.

261
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,250
I believe you will be able
to locate him there

262
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,834
on the third day
of the Romulan week

263
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:11,125
when the senate
is not in session.

264
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,583
Mr. Data, your resourcefulness
never ceases to amaze me.

265
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,125
Thank you, sir.

266
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,500
Captain, we are being hailed
by the Klingon home world.

267
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:21,417
Gowron or K'tal?

268
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,166
Neither, sir.

269
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,792
It is the junior adjutant
to the diplomatic delegation.

270
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:28,875
Junior adjutant?

271
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,000
Name.

272
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,041
B'ijik, sir.

273
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,166
On screen.

274
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,834
Greetings, Captain.

275
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,917
I regret to inform you that
Gowron and the high council

276
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,583
are quite busy and
won't be able to
speak with you today.

277
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:49,291
Is Gowron aware that we have
been transmitting messages

278
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,917
for the past three days?

279
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,166
Captain, Gowron wishes
it were possible

280
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,250
to talk with everyone
who wants an audience,

281
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,458
but he is one man--
the demands on his time
are formidable.

282
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,166
If you would like me
to take him a message...

283
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,291
A message?!

284
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,583
Very well.

285
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,959
Tell Gowron,
leader of the high council
of the Klingon empire,

286
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,125
that his arbiter
of succession,
Jean-Luc Picard,

287
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,375
needs... a favor.

288
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:20,959
A favor?

289
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,875
I require a cloaked vessel.

290
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,125
A cloaked vessel?

291
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,542
This is no small
favor, Captain.

292
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,166
It is for a mission
that could have

293
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,166
repercussions
throughout the quadrant.

294
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,291
How would it benefit
the Klingon empire?

295
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,458
I'm sure Gowron will ask.

296
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:45,125
The only benefit
to the Klingon empire
would be our gratitude.

297
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,458
That is what you want me
to tell him?

298
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:54,375
Yes, and please add
that if he is unable
to provide us with a ship,

299
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:57,834
then I am sure there are
others in the Klingon empire

300
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,500
who would be
willing to help me,

301
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:06,000
and then...<i> they</i> would
have<i> our</i> gratitude.

302
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,709
I see.

303
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,333
Also, please tell Gowron
that I am immensely gratified

304
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,500
that he is prospering
so well.

305
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:21,458
A tribute
to his skilled leadership.

306
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:33,291
They're not removable,
are they, Data?

307
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,500
Removable?

308
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,542
Your ears.

309
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,792
No, Doctor, they are
fully integrated components.

310
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,959
We'll have to do some molds
of his ears as well.

311
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,667
What about
his skin color?

312
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,625
We'll have to do some tests
on his skin pigmentation.

313
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:49,667
Changing it to appear Romulan
shouldn't be too difficult.

314
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:54,792
We just have to make sure
we can change it back
again afterwards.

315
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:58,750
Your right eye is
.004 higher than your left.

316
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,125
Nobody's perfect,
Doctor, but...

317
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:06,000
If you want a proper fit
to your prosthetic,
trust your tailor.

318
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,500
Anything from Gowron?

319
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,500
No, sir, but if, when you're
done with your "tailor,"

320
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,458
you'd join me in the cargo bay,
Mr. La Forge has made

321
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,125
some progress
with the metal fragments.

322
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,166
These two still have an
appointment with Mr. Mott

323
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,875
to have their
hairpieces designed.

324
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:20,875
30 minutes, Number One.

325
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:24,709
LA FORGE:
What we have here is a
navigational deflector array

326
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,750
or at least
what's left of one.

327
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:28,250
Who would want
a Vulcan deflector?

328
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,834
Beats me, Commander.

329
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,291
Every question we answer here
seems to bring up two more.

330
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,041
You're certain
this is Vulcan?

331
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,458
Yes, sir. Metallurgical
analysis confirmed that

332
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,750
and by running a
molecular pattern trace,

333
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:42,667
we were actually
able to identify
the ship as the<i> T'pau.</i>

334
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:44,417
It was decommissioned
years ago

335
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,083
and sent to the surplus
depot at Qualor Two.

336
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,166
As far as anybody knows,
it's still there.

337
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,250
Worf to Captain Picard.
Yes, Lieutenant?

338
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,458
A Klingon vessel
is decloaking
off our port bow,

339
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,458
compliments of Gowron.

340
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,542
Mr. Worf, will you convey
my gratitude to the captain

341
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,458
and advise him
that Mr. Data and I

342
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,208
will be transporting
over shortly?
Aye, sir.

343
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,875
I'd like to take
the<i> Enterprise</i> 
to Qualor Two, sir.

344
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:11,333
See what's out there.
Agreed.

345
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,709
Thank you,
Mr. La Forge.

346
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,875
I know my duty,
Captain.

347
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:24,166
When I am given orders,
I follow them,

348
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,375
but I do
not like secrets.

349
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:29,959
I want to know why we
are going on this mission.

350
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,583
I'm sorry.
It's a classified matter.

351
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,667
You're going after
the defector, aren't you?

352
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:39,417
Defector?

353
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,667
Do you think information
like that stays a secret?

354
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:45,542
Ambassador Spock
has gone to Romulus

355
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,709
and you're
going after him.

356
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,083
Captain, your orders
are to take us

357
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,125
to a set of coordinates
near Romulus

358
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,542
and to bring us back,

359
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,834
and that is all
I'm prepared to discuss.

360
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,667
If we are discovered
by the Romulans,

361
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,625
it means death
for us all.

362
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:02,166
I realize that.

363
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,250
<i>Hechu' ghos!</i>

364
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:13,583
Very well, Captain,
we have set a course
for Romulus.

365
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:36,250
It may not be
what you're used to
on a starfleet ship.

366
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:40,166
Quite nice.
Thank you.

367
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:44,667
Captain K'vada, is this
the captain's quarters
or my own?

368
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:48,667
Both. We have
limited space.

369
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:51,667
We are a military ship,
not a pleasure craft.

370
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:54,083
Of course.
This will be fine.

371
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:57,250
You will sleep
Klingon-style.

372
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,250
We do not soften
our bodies by...

373
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,667
putting down a pad.

374
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:04,709
Good.
I prefer it that way.

375
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,041
You will take
your meals with us,

376
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:10,083
but we do not serve
Federation food.

377
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,834
Ah! I've been looking
forward to gagh.

378
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,417
Haven't had it for
quite a while, very fresh.

379
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,792
<i>Meh hod.</i>

380
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,000
<i>Jatlh!</i>

381
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,625
<i>Mehmah ghos.</i>

382
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,083
<i>So'wl'chu.</i>

383
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:25,875
Well, Captain, we
are at the border
of the neutral zone.

384
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:27,917
You mean to do this,
do you?

385
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:30,375
Yes, I do.

386
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:33,333
<i>Un'ta.</i>

387
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:53,083
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45240.6.</i>

388
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,250
<i>The Enterprise is nearing</i>
<i>Qualor Two,</i>

389
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:59,166
<i>home of a Federation</i>
<i>surplus depot operated</i>
<i>by the Zakdorn.</i>

390
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:02,458
<i>We hope to find out how</i>
<i>the salvaged deflector array</i>

391
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,041
<i>ended up in the hands</i>
<i>of the Ferengi.</i>

392
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,291
I have made contact,
Commander.

393
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,291
On screen.

394
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:13,250
I'm Commander William
Riker from the Federation
starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

395
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:18,959
Klim Dokachin.
Quartermaster,
surplus depot zed-one-five.

396
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,250
I need some information
about a Vulcan ship--
the<i> T'pau.</i>

397
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,250
It was sent
a few years ago.

398
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,166
Did you arrange
an appointment?

399
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:29,333
An appointment?
No.

400
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,000
Then I will be
unable to help you.

401
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:35,166
You may communicate
with scheduling.

402
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,792
Who does he think he is?

403
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:43,875
The quartermaster of
the supply yard with
information you need.

404
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:48,333
Right. Mr. Worf...

405
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,750
reestablish communication.

406
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,959
Aye, sir.

407
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,166
Mr. Dokaychin...

408
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:58,917
Dok-ah-chin.
Klim Dokachin.

409
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:02,417
Mr. Dokachin,
the information I need

410
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:06,000
involves a matter of major
importance to the Federation.

411
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:08,333
I'll need access
to your logs, your files.

412
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,917
My people
can do the work.

413
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:13,667
I don't allow outsiders
into my computer system.

414
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:16,417
All right. One of<i> your</i>
people can do the work.

415
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:20,125
I wish I had the people
to spare. I don't.

416
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,917
Well, sir,
what would you suggest?

417
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:28,375
I don't know. Contact me
when you reach orbit.

418
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:31,125
I don't believe this.

419
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:34,250
He's king of his
particular hill,
Commander.

420
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:36,250
You'll have to treat
him that way.

421
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:40,875
Counselor, this feels
like a perfect job for you.

422
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,083
Thank you for coming
on board, Mr. Dokachin.

423
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,041
Quite a ship you have.

424
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,250
We're tied into
your computers,

425
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:11,333
if you'd like
to access the files.

426
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:14,583
I don't usually see them
in such good condition.

427
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:18,458
By the time they get
to me, they're always
falling apart.

428
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,041
Mr. Dokachin,
we must find this ship,

429
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,917
and you're the only
one who can help us.

430
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,709
Who are you?

431
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,083
Deanna Troi,
ship's counselor.

432
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:31,834
He probably figures
that we don't get to see

433
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,291
a lot of handsome women
out this way,

434
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:39,208
and someone like you
might get a little more
cooperation from me.

435
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,834
He's probably right.

436
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:47,208
What was the name
of that ship, the<i> T'pau?</i>

437
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,834
The<i> T'pau...</i>
Vulcan registry...

438
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:55,208
There. Logged in,
stardate 41344.

439
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,417
Where's the ship now?

440
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:59,875
Docked.
Section 18, Gamma 12.

441
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:01,208
You want me
to take you there?

442
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,458
I'd appreciate it.

443
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,250
Helmsman,
lay in a heading

444
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:09,291
141 by 208,
ahead slow, 200 kph.

445
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,792
I suppose this is
your first visit to
a junkyard, isn't it?

446
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:17,500
Mm-hmm.
You'd be surprised
at some of the things

447
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:20,834
I find on board
these ships.

448
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:29,250
I once found
a 14-foot Caldorian eel

449
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,583
on board a freighter,
in someone's locker.

450
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,417
Are you serious?

451
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,500
If you have time,
I'll show it to you.

452
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:39,417
I still have it.
Nursed her back to health.

453
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:42,583
We are approaching
the designated
coordinates, Commander.

454
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,208
On screen.

455
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,625
DOKACHIN:
What? Where is it?

456
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:50,208
What happened to it?

457
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,875
These<i> are</i>
the correct coordinates.

458
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:56,208
The<i> T'pau</i> is missing?

459
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,959
The<i> T'pau...</i> is missing.

460
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,125
How could a ship disappear
from your depot?

461
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,542
I'm not accustomed to
losing things, Commander.

462
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,333
I will find
your ship for you.

463
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,709
I have the<i> T'pau</i>
cross-referenced

464
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,792
in four different
directories.

465
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,250
When it was brought here,
was it stripped

466
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:16,208
of material, armament,
sensors?
Of course.

467
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,500
Well, can you tell us
what happened to its
navigational deflector?

468
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:25,792
It was routed to the
<i>Tripoli,</i> a holding vessel

469
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:27,500
on the outer rim
of the shipyard.

470
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,375
Well, it's not there
anymore. What's left
of that deflector

471
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:31,834
is laid out on the
floor of our cargo bay.

472
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,333
How can that be?

473
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:37,500
Perhaps we should pay
a visit to the<i> Tripoli.</i>

474
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:50,083
In all the time
that the Zakdorn
have operated this depot,

475
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,750
nothing has ever
been lost.

476
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,542
Never.

477
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,375
Approaching the coordinates
of the<i> Tripoli,</i> sir.

478
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:57,208
On screen.

479
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,667
DOKACHIN:
I do not understand this.

480
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:04,542
This is not possible.

481
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:08,041
We beam goods to the<i> Tripoli</i>
on a regular schedule.

482
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,709
There was
a shipment yesterday.

483
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,667
Another one
is set for today.

484
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,875
It must be there.

485
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:14,291
When is today's transport?

486
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,417
Just over two hours
from now.

487
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:19,834
A shipment of deuterium
storage tanks.

488
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,667
Ensign, align the<i> Enterprise</i>
so we appear to be one
of the abandoned ships.

489
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:27,667
Mr. La Forge,
when we're in position,
shut down the engines

490
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:29,792
and all systems except
sensors and life support.

491
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:31,917
Aye, sir.

492
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:35,458
I have a feeling someone's
going to be there to receive
those storage tanks.

493
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,625
I'll be very interested
to know who that is.

494
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:57,125
These quarters
were obviously intended
for one crewman, sir.

495
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,166
There is but a
single sleeping space.

496
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm sure the Klingons
found it amusing to
put us in here together.

497
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:08,333
Since I do not require
sleep, I propose you
take the... shelf, sir.

498
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,000
I am content to stand.

499
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,875
Very well, Mr. Data.
Thank you.

500
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:24,125
Are you comfortable,
sir?

501
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:25,875
I suppose so.

502
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,875
Good night, Captain.

503
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,959
Sleep well, sir.

504
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:33,500
Thank you.

505
00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:51,667
What are you doing?

506
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,291
Sir?

507
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,959
Was I making noise, sir?

508
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,625
No, not exactly.

509
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,625
I was processing
all of the information

510
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,792
we have accumulated
on Romulan society.

511
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:03,458
I am preparing for the task
of impersonating a Romulan.

512
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,208
I see.

513
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,959
Would you like me
to discontinue, sir?

514
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,333
No, no.
Please go on.

515
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:30,834
What are you looking at?

516
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,875
I am not looking
at anything, sir.

517
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,625
I am continuing
to organize my files.

518
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,750
But you were looking at me.

519
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:40,250
I am sorry if I
was disturbing you, sir.

520
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,458
I will not look
in your direction.

521
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,208
Do you not wish
to sleep, sir?

522
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,583
I don't think so,
Mr. Data.

523
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,750
Let's go on
with the files.

524
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:05,250
I would be happy to.

525
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,500
I have been studying
the Krocton segment
as you asked

526
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:10,208
and have chosen the proper
site for our transport...

527
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,709
Captain K'vada to Picard.
Please come to the bridge.

528
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:27,667
Captain...
we've monitored

529
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:30,875
a subspace message
that might interest you.

530
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,083
Sarek is dead.

531
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:58,417
Commander, sensors
detect a ship approaching
at warp speed.

532
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:00,417
Identification?

533
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:02,000
Negative.

534
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,667
No transponder signal.
No subspace marker.

535
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,709
Sounds like they don't
want to be identified.

536
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,667
The ship is coming
out of warp, sir.

537
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:10,458
On screen.

538
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,166
LA FORGE:
Sensors indicate
a combat vessel.

539
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,375
Origin undetermined.

540
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:17,333
Heavily armed.

541
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:21,458
Mass and density
suggest that it's fully
loaded with cargo.

542
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,417
I'd say from these
internal scans

543
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:25,875
that a good deal of
that cargo is weaponry.

544
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:28,417
The ship is entering
at sector 12-delta-four.

545
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:31,709
He's taking the position
assigned to the<i> Tripoli.</i>

546
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,417
The coordinates
are identical.

547
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:43,500
Commander, readings
indicate surface-to-ship
transport has begun.

548
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:45,625
Mr. La Forge, bring
the engines back on-line

549
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,667
and restore all systems
to normal.

550
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,083
Aye, sir.

551
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,667
He's powering up engines,
turning to starboard.

552
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:52,834
Open a channel.
Open.

553
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,291
This is Commander
William Riker of the
<i>U.S.S. Enterprise.</i>

554
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,709
Identify yourself.

555
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,959
I repeat-- you have entered
a Federation depot--

556
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,083
identify yourself.

557
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,959
Sir, the ship
is locking phasers.

558
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,875
Shields up.
Red alert.

559
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:11,375
That ship easily matches
our armament, Commander.

560
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:12,542
He's coming about.

561
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,041
If you do not respond
to our hails,

562
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,125
we will take that as
evidence of hostile action.

563
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:23,250
There's an energy build-up
in their phaser banks.

564
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:26,041
Sir, they're
activating weapons.

565
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,542
Forward shields
down to 72%.

566
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:31,542
Boost power the shields.
Aye, sir.

567
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:36,875
Mr. Worf, lock on to
their weapon systems only
and prepare to fire.

568
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,083
Forward shields down to 68%,
aft shields 40%.

569
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:46,750
On my mark, a .75 burst.

570
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:48,291
We just want to get
their attention.

571
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,917
Ready, sir.

572
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,500
Fire.

573
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:57,709
Their forward shields
are damaged, sir.

574
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,542
We destroyed one
of their phaser arrays.

575
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:03,667
Looks like collateral
damage in the cargo area.

576
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:09,417
Commander, I'm picking up
massive power fluctuations,
internal explosions.

577
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:13,166
With all the armament
that ship is carrying,
it's going to blow.

578
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:33,917
PICARD:
Well, Mr. Data,
what do you think?

579
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,458
I would not have thought
it possible, sir.

580
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,458
I am eager to test the
success of our efforts.

581
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,417
It does remain to be seen
whether the Romulans
will accept us.

582
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:58,917
Captain, you've seemed
unusually pensive

583
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:02,875
since we received the news
of Ambassador Sarek's death.

584
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:07,375
Sarek and I share
a particular bond.

585
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:11,375
Our lives touched
in an unusual way.

586
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:16,875
I admit, I feel
the effects of his death.

587
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:19,750
The tenor of this mission
has changed, Mr. Data.

588
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:21,333
At least, it has for me.

589
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:24,917
We were sent to confront Spock
about his disappearance

590
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:28,375
and now I also have to tell
him that his father is dead.

591
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:32,000
I do not entirely
understand, sir.

592
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,583
As a Vulcan, Ambassador Spock
would simply see death

593
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:38,542
as the logical result
of his father's illness.

594
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:42,333
It's never quite that simple,
not even for a Vulcan.

595
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:46,041
Certainly not for Spock,
who is half human.

596
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:49,125
Years spent in conflict,

597
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:53,208
and now the chance
to resolve those
differences is gone.

598
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,458
Considering the
exceptionally long
lifespan of Vulcans,

599
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,542
it does seem odd
that Sarek and Spock

600
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,583
did not choose to
resolve those differences
in the time allowed.

601
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:07,333
Father and son--
both proud, both stubborn,

602
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:11,750
more alike than either of
them were prepared to admit.

603
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:15,375
A lifetime spent building
emotional barriers.

604
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:17,959
They are very difficult
to break down,

605
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,083
and now the time has come
and it's too late.

606
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,333
It's a difficult moment.

607
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:27,750
It's a lonely one.

608
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:32,291
It's a moment that
Spock is about to face.

609
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:37,875
(<i> laughing</i> )

610
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:41,917
Don't you two look sweet?

611
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:44,000
Be careful, android.

612
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:47,542
Some Romulan beauty
might take a liking to you.

613
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:48,959
(<i> hisses</i> )

614
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,792
Lick that paint
right off your ears.

615
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:54,208
You!

616
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,917
Do you know what the
Romulans will do to you

617
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,208
if they discover
who you are?

618
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,667
I have a good idea.

619
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:02,625
We're ready to transport
down to the surface.

620
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:05,125
Just so we understand
each other,

621
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:08,917
my orders don't include
rescue missions!

622
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:28,333
Ah, Senator Pardek.
You received my message.

623
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:31,834
I got here as quickly
as I could, pro-consul.

624
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:34,750
What do you know
of this human--

625
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:38,000
Jean-Luc Picard,
a starfleet captain?

626
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:40,625
I know nothing of him.

627
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,959
Then you haven't
seen him recently?

628
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,625
To my knowledge,
I have never seen him.

629
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,500
I have received
intelligence

630
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,583
indicating he
is on his way here,

631
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,500
perhaps here already.

632
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:54,542
Here on Romulus?

633
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:56,083
Yes.

634
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:58,959
Curious, isn't it?

635
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:00,500
I suppose
we'd better find out

636
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:04,291
if the report is accurate
or merely rumor.

637
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:07,291
Circulate his likeness
among the security forces.

638
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,000
Remind them
that if he is here,

639
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:12,208
he's probably disguised
as one of us.

640
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,375
I'll see to it.

641
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:25,959
This is definitely
the street on which
the intelligence scan

642
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,250
of Spock and Pardek
was taken, sir.

643
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,041
Adjusting for
the optical distortions,

644
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,375
I am able to verify
the architectural features.

645
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:34,500
Where were they standing?

646
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:42,792
Data, you're moving
about in a very...

647
00:40:42,834 --> 00:40:46,458
well... android way.

648
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,291
I am sorry, Captain.
I will be more careful.

649
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:51,166
Don't call me Captain.

650
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,750
I understand, sir.

651
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:55,333
I have found the place
where they were standing.

652
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,917
Where?

653
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:59,500
It is here...

654
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:03,750
at this doorway...

655
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:06,083
a legal
intercessor's office.

656
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:07,959
The name is similar
to Pardek's.

657
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,041
It would appear to be
one of his relatives.

658
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,375
(<i> knocking</i> )

659
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,083
Not open
for business yet.

660
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:27,166
Nonetheless, I recommend
we keep this location
under observation.

661
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,667
I have clearly determined
Pardek's routine.

662
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:31,583
On days when the senate
is not in session,

663
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:36,000
he invariably comes
to this section
after the median hour.

664
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:37,333
Very well.

665
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:43,083
Let's, uh, sample the local
cuisine, shall we?

666
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,709
Do you happen
to know what time

667
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,750
the intercessor's office
across the way opens?

668
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:57,417
Why do you
want to know?

669
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:00,083
I need his services.
He was recommended.

670
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,709
I haven't seen you
here before.

671
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,208
We're here for the day
from the city of Rateg.

672
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,750
Rateg?
I don't think so.

673
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,542
Why do you say that?

674
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,750
You don't sound
like you're from Rateg.

675
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:15,291
It is a misconception
that all Rategs speak

676
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,583
with a particular
inflection.

677
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,041
In fact there are
12 different...

678
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:21,041
We come from several
kilometers outside the city.

679
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,041
Or perhaps you come
from the security forces

680
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,041
to watch the
intercessor's office.

681
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,375
Is he in trouble?

682
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:28,625
You're mistaken,
madam.

683
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,875
Doesn't matter to me.

684
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:33,125
I don't know
when he opens.

685
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:37,208
Eat your soup, courtesy
of a<i> loyal</i> establishment.

686
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,458
Jolan true.

687
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,625
I don't think we can
stay here too long.

688
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,834
We may not have to.

689
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:07,291
Direct your view
to the far corner, sir.

690
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:16,375
Is that not Pardek?

691
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:18,709
I believe it is.

692
00:43:20,917 --> 00:43:24,709
Perhaps you should appear
to enjoy your soup, sir.

693
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:38,667
Do not move.

694
00:43:38,709 --> 00:43:39,625
What?

695
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:40,667
Hey, you've made
a mistake.

696
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:42,792
Quiet. Come with us.

697
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:56,417
Wait here.

698
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:57,917
What for?

699
00:43:57,959 --> 00:44:00,000
What have you
brought us here for?

700
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:05,375
Welcome to Romulus,
Captain Picard.

701
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:09,208
Don't let our
soldiers frighten you.

702
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:13,333
We had to get you
off the street as
quickly as we could.

703
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,583
Romulan security
knows that you're here.

704
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:18,625
I am Pardek.

705
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:20,834
You are among friends,
Captain.

706
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:24,250
I have come on
an urgent mission
from the Federation.

707
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:26,750
I'm looking
for Ambassador Spock.

708
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:30,083
MAN:
Indeed.

709
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:35,250
You have found him,
Captain Picard.
