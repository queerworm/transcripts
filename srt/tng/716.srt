00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:07,750
<i>Bridge Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47611.2.</i>

2
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:10,667
<i>Dr. Beverly Crusher reporting.</i>

3
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:13,792
<i>We have rendezvoused with</i>
<i>Counselor Troi's shuttlecraft.</i>

4
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:15,834
<i>She has just returned</i>
<i>from a three-day class reunion</i>

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:19,125
<i>on Starbase 231.</i>

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,583
Send a message to commander Data
and inform him of our delay.

7
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,542
Aye, sir.

8
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:26,709
Deanna, welcome back.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,166
Thank you.

10
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,667
I was just reporting in.

11
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:32,041
I didn't expect to find
anyone up except Data.

12
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,750
Data's away on assignment.

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,583
A Federation deep space probe
went off course

14
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,709
and crashed on Barkon IV.

15
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,166
Some of the material
in the casing was radioactive,

16
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,750
so Data was sent

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,333
to recover it before it could
contaminate the biosphere.

18
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,458
Isn't Barkon IV inhabited?

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,709
Yes, it's
a preindustrial society,

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,625
but the probe crashed
over a hundred kilometers

21
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:51,709
from the nearest settlement,

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,041
so Data shouldn't
have any contact

23
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,458
with the Barkonians.

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,875
So... how was the reunion?

25
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:00,875
Fine-- it was good to
see some old friends.

26
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:03,792
I'd lost touch
with most of them.

27
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,542
It's interesting to see
the different paths

28
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:09,333
some of their
lives have taken.

29
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,583
Beverly, you
don't usually stand
a watch on the Bridge

30
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,458
even when Data's
not here.

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,000
I volunteered tonight.

32
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:19,083
I like to put in a little
Bridge time now and then--

33
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:23,834
stay on top of operations,
tactical procedures.

34
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,166
The truth is, I like it.

35
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,750
It's not every doctor
who gets to command a starship,

36
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:32,625
even if it is the night shift.

37
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,417
May I ask you
a personal question?

38
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:37,750
Mm-hmm.

39
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,625
Why did you decide
to become a commander?

40
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,417
I mean, you don't
need the rank

41
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,792
in order to be
chief medical officer,

42
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:45,250
so why put yourself

43
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,917
through all
the extra work?

44
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,333
Oh, I don't know.

45
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,291
I never even thought
about my rank for a long time.

46
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,083
It seemed pretty trivial
compared to being a doctor

47
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,667
but then about eight years ago

48
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:00,917
I started to feel like I wanted
to stretch myself a little.

49
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,500
Commander,

50
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:05,208
there's no response from
Commander Data to our signal.

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,000
Continue sending him updates
on our schedule.

52
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,083
MAN: Aye, sir.

53
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,458
Is something wrong?

54
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,959
No, I just wanted

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,583
to let Data know
there'd be a delay

56
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,083
in picking him up
for a few days.

57
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,625
We have orders to rendezvous
with the<i> Lexington</i>

58
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,041
and take some medical supplies

59
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,417
to the Taranko colony.

60
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:21,959
But he's not responding.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,834
Geordi said that the radiation
from the probe

62
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,417
might interfere
with communications.

63
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,709
I just thought I'd try anyway.

64
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,750
MAN: So, when you return
from school tonight,

65
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll be meeting with
the village elders.

66
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,834
GIRL: Again?

67
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,208
Gia...

68
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,083
I know, I know-- you're
the town magistrate

69
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,458
and you have a lot
of work to do.

70
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,750
But it always seems

71
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,166
like you're in some
kind of meeting or...

72
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,000
(<i> electronic noise</i> )

73
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:29,291

81
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,834
Who are you?

82
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,166
What do you want?

83
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,542
(<i> speaking very slowly</i> ):
Wha...

84
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:03,792
you... want.

85
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:06,625
What...

86
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,667
do you want?

87
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,625
What's wrong with you?

88
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,083
What's...

89
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,417
wrong with you?

90
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,709
There's nothing wrong with me.

91
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,500
Who are you?

92
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:26,542
What is your name?

93
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,625
Can you understand me?

94
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,417
My name is Garvin.

95
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:41,458
My name...

96
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,667
is Garvin.

97
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,125
(<i> giggles</i> )

98
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,709
I thought I told you to go home.

99
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,667
I know.

100
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,667
I...

101
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:59,125
do not know my name.

102
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,583
What?

103
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,166
You asked...

104
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,417
if I knew my name.

105
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,792
I do not.

106
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,041
Well, at least
you seem to be

107
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,000
understanding a little more.

108
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,875
Yes.

109
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,875
It is...

110
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,792
becoming easier.

111
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,208
Ask him where
he's from, Father.

112
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,792
Gia, go on to school.

113
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,917
I'll deal with the stranger.

114
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,291
Yes, Father.

115
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,041
Good-bye.

116
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,000
Good-bye.

117
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:43,917
Your eyes and your skin
look so strange.

118
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,667
Your clothes.

119
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,417
You look like you've been
in some kind of accident.

120
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:58,709
I do not remember...
being in an accident.

121
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,709
What do you remember?

122
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:07,458
I walked here...
from the mountains.

123
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,583
The mountains?

124
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,667
The mountains are over
200<i> seltons</i> from here.

125
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:16,917
I have a clear memory
of my journey.

126
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,417
What do you remember
before that?

127
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:26,875
I have no prior memory.

128
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:31,208
Do you know what that is?

129
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,166
No.

130
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,125
May I?

131
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,625
May I have it?

132
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,709
Yes.

133
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:51,583
There might be something in here
that can tell us who you are.

134
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,333
I wonder what
these markings mean.

135
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,542
Radioactive.

136
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,208
What?

137
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,250
That is what is written
on the container.

138
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,375
You can read this language?

139
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,125
Evidently.

140
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,125
Radioactive.

141
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,125
What does that mean?

142
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,792
I do not know.

143
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:14,542
Perhaps it is my name.

144
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,667
I've never heard
a name like that.

145
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:21,792
You must come
from a very distant place.

146
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,291
(<i> playing up-tempo jazz</i> )

147
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,834
(<i> playing two short</i>
<i>questioning notes</i> )

148
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,625
Is that supposed
to be a question?

149
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:04,750
(<i> playing affirmative note</i> )

150
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:05,834
Because if you're
asking me

151
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,875
if I liked what you
were playing

152
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:07,959
then the answer's yes.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,291
(<i> playing a "thank you"</i> )

154
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,583
You know, this is
a much better way

155
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,166
of communicating for you.

156
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,834
It's far less confusing
than the way you normally speak.

157
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,959
(<i> playing a sour note</i> )

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,792
I knew I could count
on my<i> imzadi--</i>

the ship's counselor--

160
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,208
to boost my self-image.

161
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,959
I'm glad to be of service.

162
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,500
Did you come here for
something in particular

163
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:27,667
or just general
Riker-bashing?

164
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,667
Actually, I wanted
to ask your opinion
about something.

165
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:34,041
I've been thinking about taking
the Bridge officer's test

166
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,875
and becoming a full commander.

167
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:37,417
What brought this up?

168
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,041
A lot of things--

169
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,375
working on the personnel
review last month,

170
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:44,083
talking to Beverly
about her experiences,

171
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,959
going to my class reunion.

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,875
Ah...
the class reunion.

173
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:52,667
You saw a few old friends
who had already taken the test?

174
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,291
All right, I admit,
it was a catalyst

175
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,667
but I can honestly say

176
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,625
that I've been thinking
about this off and on

177
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,333
for the past two years.

178
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,750
Why the past two years?

179
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,625
Do you remember
when the<i> Enterprise</i>

180
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:04,959
hit that quantum filament

181
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,625
and I was in command
on the Bridge?

182
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,959
I do.

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,375
Well, when that happened,
I was overwhelmed,

184
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,625
but then when it was over

185
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,834
I realized that a part
of me missed it--

186
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,917
not the actual disaster--

187
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,208
but the experience
of being in command.

188
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,792
I felt like I was exploring
a whole new side of myself--

189
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,125
not that I want to give up
counseling, by any means,

190
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,625
but I really would like
to stretch myself a little.

191
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:35,583
Deanna... if you take
the Bridge officer's test,

192
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,125
you'll have
my complete support.

193
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,583
But as First Officer,

194
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,166
I'll be the one judging
your performance,

195
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,750
and you should know
I am a pretty tough judge.

196
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,792
And<i> I'm</i> a pretty good student.

197
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,667
We'll start
tomorrow morning.

198
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,542
0800 hours.

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,417
Remarkable set of teeth.

200
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,667
Breath smells like...

201
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,750
Well, it doesn't have
any smell, actually.

202
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,750
You can close
your mouth.

203
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:05,959
Let's see...

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,959
heartbeat sounds
a little odd

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,834
but seems very regular.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,709
Skin feels... clammy.

207
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,625
But you say
you feel fine?

208
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,250
That is correct.

209
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,875
No headaches, palpitations,
sluggishness, indigestion?

210
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:24,375
No. But I cannot
have indigestion

211
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,458
since I have not eaten.

212
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,375
Ah, malnutrition.

213
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:29,083
You should try
to eat something

214
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,959
that will build your strength
and return your vitality.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,709
Lots of meat, butter, cheese.

216
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,083
That should be a start.

217
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,834
What about his eyes
and his skin?

218
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,166
They're so odd.

219
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,875
WOMAN:
Quite so.
Quite so.

220
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:41,792
I'm sure my grandmother would
have called our friend here

221
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,917
a demon or a spirit
or some sort of monster,

222
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,208
but current scientific
methodology allows us

223
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,709
to dismiss such
ridiculous superstitions

224
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,250
and concentrate
on scientific reality.

225
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,333
Then what do you believe I am?

226
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,750
You are an iceman.

227
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,375
Ice-man?

228
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:02,083
Yes, you probably come
from a race of people

229
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,625
who lived in the snow and the
ice of the Vellorian mountains.

230
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:06,917
Your skin and eye coloration

231
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,542
are a result
of prolonged exposure

232
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,125
to harsh
winter conditions.

233
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,709
Then I am not ill?

234
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,458
Well, aside from
your memory loss,

235
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,125
you do not seem to have
any symptoms of any illness

236
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,041
that I am familiar with.

237
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,834
No, you are an iceman.

238
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,625
Now, get something to eat
and a good night's rest

239
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,417
and I will come back tomorrow

240
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,166
and see if your memory
has begun to return.

241
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,458
(<i> knocking on door</i> )

242
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,083
Thank you.

243
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,125
Hello, Gia.

244
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,625
Hello.

245
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,917
What did Talar
say about him?

246
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,125
Is he sick?

247
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,625
Not exactly.

248
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,291
She said
he's lost his memory

249
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,500
but seems
to be fine otherwise.

250
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,542
Talar thinks
he's from a race

251
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,625
that lives
in the mountains.

252
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,500
I am an iceman.

253
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,542
We'll have to call you
something besides "iceman"

254
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,625
until your memory returns.

255
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,500
What was the word
on the container?

256
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,959
DATA: Radioactive.

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,709
Mr. Radioactive?

258
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,250
GIA:
I don't like
that name.

259
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,959
Let's call him... Jayden.

260
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What do you think of that?

261
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,750
Jayden.

262
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:20,667
That is acceptable.

263
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,500
Right now, we need
to clean him up

264
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,667
and get him
something decent to wear.

265
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:27,375
Run upstairs and get some
of my old clothes for him.

266
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,417
Yes, Father.

267
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,667
I wonder if Skoran can tell us

268
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,500
something about
this metal of yours.

269
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:37,458
(<i> children laughing,</i>
<i>indistinct conversation</i> )

270
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,625
(<i> metallic clanging</i> )

271
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,291
You, Iceman,
where did you find this?

272
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,083
I do not know.

273
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,166
I told you,
he's lost his memory.

274
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,458
And we're calling him
Jayden for now.

275
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,792
Jayden, huh?

276
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,917
The metal is
slightly warm.

277
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,000
GARVIN:
All the fragments
are like that.

278
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,208
It's obviously been
tempered and milled--

279
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,500
the lustrous quality
of the metal is so pure.

280
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:11,500
This wasn't made in any forge
that I've ever seen.

281
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:12,667
Will you sell them?

282
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:14,500
You want them?

283
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,834
The metal is malleable enough
to make some jewelry.

284
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,750
They belong
to Jayden.

285
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,542
Do you want
to sell them?

286
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,333
You're going
to need money.

287
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,291
You may be right.

288
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,709
But I do not wish
to sell all the fragments.

289
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,375
They may provide
a clue to my identity.

290
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:32,792
I'll give you 20<i> doraks</i>
for half the lot.

291
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,291
Agreed.

292
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,166
(<i> cracking, tools clanging</i> )

293
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,458
Ow! Ow!

294
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,291
My leg! My leg!
Get it off!

295
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,417
Get it off! Ow!

296
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,750
We need a lever!

297
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,125
It'll be all right.

298
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,834
Don't struggle.
It will...

299
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,125
Jayden... put it down.

300
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,667
I believe that the support
structure on the anvil collapsed

301
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:30,667
because some of
the wood had rotted.

302
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:33,291
(<i> crowd chattering</i> )

303
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,291
Did I do something wrong,
Garvin?

304
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,333
No.

305
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,375
Just unexpected.

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,750
It's perfectly
understandable.

307
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:57,542
Your people probably
all have great strength.

308
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,709
It would allow them

309
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,667
to fight off
the ferocious creatures

310
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,375
that live in
the Vellorian mountains.

311
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,458
You have told me
that no one from the village

312
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,959
has ever been
to the Vellorian mountains.

313
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,333
How can you be certain

314
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,417
there are ferocious
creatures there?

315
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,834
It's a well-known fact.

316
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,583
DATA:
But no one has
actually seen one?

317
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,291
Well, not to my knowledge,
but...

318
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,500
Father, are
you all right?

319
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,417
I've been tired
since this afternoon.

320
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,041
I'm sure it's nothing.

321
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,875
You feel slightly warm.

322
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,625
TALAR: Some fresh air
and a brisk walk

323
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:32,750
will do you good.

324
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,375
That sounds
like a good idea.

325
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,917
I'll be back soon.

326
00:16:57,834 --> 00:16:59,583
You didn't like it?

327
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,542
I neither liked it
nor disliked it.

328
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,250
I simply had no appetite.

329
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:10,959
Father's cooking
isn't as good as mother's.

330
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,291
He tries, though.

331
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,333
Where is your mother?

332
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,458
She died about a year ago.

333
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,041
Father said she...

334
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,458
she went
to a beautiful place

335
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,625
where everything
is peaceful

336
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,417
and everyone
loves each other

337
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:34,500
and no one
ever gets sick.

338
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:37,792
Do you think there's really
a place like that?

339
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,083
Yes.

340
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,542
I do.

341
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,959
We just lost contact
with everything above Deck 21,

342
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,333
including the Bridge.

343
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,875
WORF:
There's something
wrong with one of

344
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,625
the antimatter
containment units.

345
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,583
The magnetic field is
starting to fluctuate.

346
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,542
Switch to auxiliary control.

347
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,333
Auxiliary control
is not on line.

348
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,333
We are starting
to lose containment

349
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,250
on antimatter
storage unit three.

350
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,792
All right.

351
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,667
Switch the EM power inverter
to the lateral...

352
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:26,333
No, wait!

353
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,333
Use the neodyne relay!

354
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,500
Commander, the neodyne relay
isn't holding.

355
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,500
Containment failure
in ten seconds.

356
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:35,959

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,875

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,458
Congratulations.

364
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,000
You just destroyed
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

365
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,917
Thank you for
the encouragement.

366
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,125
Don't feel bad.

367
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,917
You passed everything else.

368
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,125
Diplomatic law,
First Contact procedure,

369
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,667
Bridge operations.

370
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:03,875
The engineering qualification

371
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,417
is one of the toughest
parts of the test.

372
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,208
So what did I do wrong?

373
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,750
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that.

374
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,834
Why not?
What kind of a test is this?

375
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,667
It's the kind of a test
that you're going to have

376
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:15,417
to take again if you want
to be a Bridge officer.

377
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:19,750
Only next time, the problem
won't be so easy.

378
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,041
So I suggest

379
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,041
you study up
on your emergency procedures.

380
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,625
Well, how do I know
what to study

381
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,250
if you won't tell me
what I did wrong?

382
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,917
I don't know.

383
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,291
I'm afraid I can't
tell you that either.

384
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,041
Rock, fire, sky and water

385
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,500
are the basic elements
of the universe.

386
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,709
They can be found
in every object,

387
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,875
every animal, every person--
everything.

388
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,041
The rock in this wood
can be felt

389
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,959
by its weight
and hardness.

390
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,125
If we expose the wood
to flame

391
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,125
we can encourage
the fire within the wood

392
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,291
to show itself.

393
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:59,709
We can also see smoke...

394
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,750
which is a part
of the sky.

395
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:06,583
The water in wood
is difficult to see.

396
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,750
Sometimes the elements

397
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,875
are buried deep
within the objects,

398
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,792
but the four elements
are always there.

399
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,792
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

400
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,917
Yes, Jayden.

401
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,333
I do not believe
that is correct.

402
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,083
Oh?

403
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,417
I believe you
are reasoning by analogy--

404
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,291
classifying objects
and phenomena

405
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,750
according to
superficial observation

406
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:32,333
rather than
empirical evidence.

407
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,750
Wood, for example,

408
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:35,917
does not contain fire

409
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,667
simply because
it is combustible.

410
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:38,709
Nor does it contain rock

411
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,375
simply because
it is heavy.

412
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:43,834
Wood, like any
complex organic form,

413
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,083
is composed of thousands of
different chemical compounds,

414
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,917
none of which is fire.

415
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,417
That will be enough
for now, Jayden.

416
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,875
As I told you earlier,

417
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,834
our friend Jayden here
has lost much of his memory,

418
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:59,083
so I wouldn't put too much
faith in any of his ideas.

419
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,125
Now, that will be all
for today.

420
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,583
I will see you all tomorrow.

421
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,750
Be sure to practice

422
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:05,166
your spelling
and arithmetic tonight.

423
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,792
Are you all right?

424
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:23,375
Yes, but I do not agree
with Talar's assessment.

425
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:27,667
Although I do have
gaps in my memory...

426
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:30,583
I know that fire
is not an element.

427
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:34,000
GARVIN:
That is not
what you promised me.

428
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,750
You're getting old,
Garvin.

429
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:38,041
I offered you 15 for the metal,
and I've given it to you.

430
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,041
No more.

431
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,291
We agreed on 20!

432
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,000
Garvin is correct.

433
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,583
You agreed on 20.

434
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,917
Stay out of this, Iceman.

435
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,000
Your memory is not
very reliable.

436
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,792
Father... Father,
what's wrong?

437
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:50,834
I don't know.

438
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:54,083
I feel very weak
suddenly.

439
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,041
You have a fever.

440
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,583
We should get him home.

441
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,625
What's wrong with him?

442
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,333
I suspect he...

443
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,583
I don't know.

444
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:18,125
I've never encountered
anything like this before.

445
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,333
These lesions

446
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,250
look like burn marks.

447
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,041
The fluids of his body
have overheated.

448
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,125
That would explain the fever

449
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,917
and the burning skin.

450
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,750
Keep him cool.

451
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,834
Let plenty of fresh air
into the house,

452
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,875
and I want you
to give him these herbs.

453
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:43,250
That will bring
his fluidic temperature down

454
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,083
and allow this to pass.

455
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,291
I understand.

456
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,583
With an increased
focal length

457
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,500
and an achromatic
objective lens,

458
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:54,709
this instrument will have

459
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,208
a higher effective
magnification.

460
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,792
I will come back tomorrow
and check on you.

461
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,291
(<i> weakly</i> )
Thank you.

462
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,125
Garvin...

463
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,125
with your permission,
I would like to begin

464
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,000
my own investigation
regarding the cause

465
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,500
of your illness.

466
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,375
Go ahead.

467
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:19,291
Gia, I would like you
to accompany me to the village.

468
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,458
I will need
some supplies.

469
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,375
What are you going to do
with all this?

470
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,917
I will use these materials
to make the laboratory equipment

471
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:38,625
I need to research
your father's illness.

472
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,291
Do you think
you can help him?

473
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,917
I do not know.

474
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:44,208
First, I must isolate
the cause of the illness...

475
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,250
SKORAN: There he is!

476
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,750
It's his fault.

477
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,208
None of us were sick
before he came to the village.

478
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,792
MEN:
True!

479
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:53,667
(<i> angry muttering</i> )

480
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:56,291
Am I to understand
Garvin's illness has spread?

481
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,250
That's right,
and you're the cause!

482
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,625
That's not true!

483
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:03,750
Gia, I think
we should leave.

484
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,667
That's it! Leave!

485
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:06,709
Get out of here!

486
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,125
Go back to where
you came from!

487
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,959
(<i> angry shouting</i> )

488
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,834
Jayden, what
are you doing?

489
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:27,959
I am studying skin samples
from Gia and Garvin

490
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,542
in an attempt to isolate
the cause of the illness.

491
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,500
Gia?

492
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:34,083
Yes.

493
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:37,125
She is also beginning to show
signs of the illness.

494
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,500
What is that?

495
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:45,166
It is a magnifying device based
on your hand-held instrument.

496
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,000
I have refined the design

497
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,625
to increase
the magnification level.

498
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,083
May I?

499
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,625
Of course.

500
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:59,375
How strong
is the magnification?

501
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:03,375
Objects appear approximately
500 times their normal size.

502
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:05,375
As you can see,

503
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,375
the cellular damage
is quite extensive.

504
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:08,625
However, based

505
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,458
on interstitial
transparency

506
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,083
and membrane
integrity

507
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:14,083
I do not believe
it is an infection

508
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,834
or any other form
of communicable disease.

509
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,750
I see.

510
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:23,542
At the moment, I am looking for
a common event or experience

511
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:27,166
that Gia, Garvin,
and Skoran may have shared

512
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:29,750
that could have
a causal relationship

513
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:31,500
to their illness.

514
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:34,083
Well, they've all lived here
in the village for many years.

515
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,125
I'm sure they have
many common experiences.

516
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,875
Yes, but since the illness
struck all three

517
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,917
in a relatively
short period of time,

518
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,208
it is reasonable to assume

519
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,291
the experience is recent
and unusual.

520
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,834
Actually, Jayden,
encountering<i> you</i>

521
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,166
has been the most
unusual experience

522
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,125
they've all
shared recently.

523
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,000
I am aware of that.

524
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:54,750
Excuse me.

525
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:56,458
I am also open
to the possibility

526
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,917
that I may in some way
be the causal factor.

527
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,458
However, since you have had
a great deal of contact with me

528
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,208
and you show no signs
of the sickness,

529
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,083
I tend to discount myself

530
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,542
as a likely candidate.

531
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,959
Still, it has to be
more than just a coincidence

532
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,500
that, shortly
after you arrived,

533
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:14,625
people started
to become ill.

534
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,333
I agree.

535
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,500
Jayden...

536
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:23,000
I tried to give
Father his broth,

537
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,917
but he won't eat.

538
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,583
You have a fever.

539
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,333
You should be in bed.

540
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,375
No, I'm all right.

541
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:31,959
Father needs me.

542
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,208
Talar is correct.

543
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,417
You should rest.

544
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:37,792
I will attend
to your father.

545
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,250
Gia...

546
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,291
when did you begin wearing
that pendant?

547
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,917
Two days ago.

548
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:46,041
Father bought it from Skoran.

549
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,250
Why?

550
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,917
May I see it?

551
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,917
This is one
of the metal fragments

552
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:00,917
I sold to Skoran.

553
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,375
(<i> sighs</i> )

554
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:18,166
The secondary plasma vent...

555
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,000
has a triple-redundant bypass...

556
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:30,166
which means that
the primary access junction

557
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,500
is routed through...

558
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:33,750
(<i> door chimes</i> )

559
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:35,375
Come in.

560
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,667
...would be routed through

561
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:42,250
the port transducer
matrix.

562
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:44,959
Come to give me
more encouragement?

563
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,583
No.

564
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:50,083
I'm actually here to tell you
that I've decided to cancel

565
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,041
the rest of your test.

566
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,083
What?!

567
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,709
I'm canceling the test.

568
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,792
May I ask why?

569
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:58,291
You've taken the engineering
qualification three times.

570
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,542
You're no closer to passing.

571
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:01,291
Well then I'll take it
four times

572
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,709
or 14 times,
or however many times

573
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,333
is necessary for me
to get it right!

574
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:11,208
Deanna, this is
nothing personal.

575
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,625
Not everyone is cut out
to be a Bridge officer.

576
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,917
I don't think
this is for you.

577
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:19,542
Why? Because I'm not the most
technically-minded person

578
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:20,625
on the ship?

579
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,250
I may have trouble

580
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,709
telling the difference between

581
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,542
a plasma conduit
and an phase inducer,

582
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,750
but there's more to being
a Bridge officer

583
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,500
than memorizing
technical manuals!

584
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,166
That's right,
there is.

585
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,625
You could spend
the next month memorizing

586
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,834
all the technical manuals
in the computer.

587
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,959
I still don't think
you'd pass the test.

588
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,792
Tell me one thing.

589
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,083
Is there a solution,
or is this simply a test

590
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,250
of my ability to handle
a no-win situation?

591
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:47,041
There is a solution.

592
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,083
Then give me time to find it.

593
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,834
I can't.

594
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,458
As much as I care
about you,

595
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,083
my first duty is to the ship.

596
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:59,959
I cannot let any Bridge officer
serve who's not qualified.

597
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,208
I'm sorry.

598
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

599
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:32,625
"My first duty
is to the ship..."

600
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,875
(<i> whispers</i> ):
The ship.

601
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:40,166
Computer,
load Bridge officer's test

602
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,375
engineering qualification,
section one.

603
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:45,250
COMPUTER: Computer ready.

604
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,750
Run program.

605
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:48,375
The control system for
the primary containment field

606
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,125
is not functioning.

607
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,583
Something severed
the ODN conduit

608
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,041
between here and
the antimatter storage deck.

609
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,625
Geordi...

610
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,750
could you repair
the ODN conduit

611
00:29:57,792 --> 00:29:59,834
if you went
into the crawl space?

612
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:03,875
Sir, that crawlway is
in a warp-plasma shaft.

613
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:07,041
He would never survive
the radiation.

614
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,875
I know that.

615
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:12,542
Geordi, could you
repair the conduit?

616
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,875
Yeah. I think I could.

617
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,625
Then do it.

618
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:20,667
That's an order.

619
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,959
RIKER:
End simulation.

620
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,959
Something told me
you wouldn't let this go.

621
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:47,125
Congratulations.

622
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,458
You passed.

623
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,750
That's what this
was all about, wasn't it?

624
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:53,041
To see if I'd order someone
to their death.

625
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,375
That's right.

626
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,083
I knew that was part
of being in command,

627
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,000
and I thought
I'd prepared for it,

628
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,083
but, when the moment came,
I hesitated.

629
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,291
Maybe you were right.

630
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:04,959
Maybe I'm not
cut out for this.

631
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,875
You did exactly
what you had to do.

632
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,750
You considered
all your options.

633
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,375
You tried every
alternative,

634
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,667
and then you made
the hard choice.

635
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:16,375
Come on.

636
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:20,041
Let's get out
of here, Commander.

637
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,041
I have coated
this piece of cloth

638
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,834
with the liquid which
is used in lamps.

639
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,667
As you can see, the cloth

640
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:37,208
becomes luminescent when it is
exposed to an energy source.

641
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:45,291
This pendant also appears
to be an energy source.

642
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:49,667
But... where is this pattern
of light coming from?

643
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:52,458
I believe a stream
of particles is emanating

644
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,542
from the metallic pendant
and hitting the cloth.

645
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:58,792
I don't see any particles
coming from the pendant.

646
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,750
DATA:
You will see there are.

647
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,417
I can even block them.

648
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:07,166
It would appear
that this container

649
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,083
was constructed
of a material

650
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,542
which absorbs
or blocks

651
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:13,041
the particles coming
from the metal.

652
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,333
It's a trick.

653
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:17,583
No...
It is empirical data.

654
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,291
I believe the fragments

655
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,709
were originally placed
in this container

656
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,583
to protect people
from accidental exposure.

657
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,291
The word "radioactive"
may be a warning

658
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:30,625
about the dangerous nature
of the metal.

659
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:33,709
All right, let's say for
the moment that you are right--

660
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,458
that there<i> are</i> invisible
particles coming from the metal.

661
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,917
What should we do?

662
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,667
I will continue my experiment.

663
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,709
I would like you to gather

664
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,625
all of the pieces of metal
in the village

665
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:48,166
and place them
in this container.

666
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,375
All right, but when I return

667
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:52,709
I want a more thorough
explanation of all this...

668
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,542
and I want to examine
your data in detail.

669
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:57,000
Of course.

670
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,709
(<i> pounding on door</i> )

671
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:25,959
There you are!

672
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,417
You are the cause
of this, Iceman.

673
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:28,709
If you are referring

674
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,125
to the illness,
you are partially correct.

675
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,000
However, it is
more complex than that.

676
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,792
The metal fragment which...

677
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,250
(<i> grunts</i> )

678
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,875
What... what are you?

679
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,041
I do not know.

680
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,375
I saw it with my own eyes.

681
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:07,417
He's not a person.

682
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:08,667
He's some kind
of creature.

683
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:11,208
It's not true, Father.

684
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,709
We must find him...

685
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,041
and stop him,
before he kills us all.

686
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:18,667
I don't... not Jayden.

687
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:20,834
He wouldn't try to hurt us.

688
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,667
Ahh...

689
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:23,750
Come on!

690
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:26,375
(<i> angry muttering</i> )

691
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,583
Let him rest for now.

692
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,375
You should
rest as well.

693
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:37,667
Exerting yourself
will only make you sicker.

694
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,375
I'll be back.

695
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,291
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Gia.

696
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:09,375
Jayden...

697
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:12,125
Everyone's looking
for you.

698
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,458
Skoran said...

699
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,917
you're some kind of...
creature.

700
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:21,625
I do not know...
what I am.

701
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:23,959
But I am not like you.

702
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,875
I know...
you're an iceman.

703
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,083
We talked about that.

704
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,291
No.

705
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:36,125
I am not.

706
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,208
Jayden...

707
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,583
Why are you wearing
that hood?

708
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:43,291
I do not wish
to frighten you.

709
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,834
I won't be afraid.

710
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,500
Take it off.

711
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:48,917
Please, I have to see.

712
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:04,500
I understand your reaction.

713
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:08,083
But I do not wish
to harm you.

714
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,375
You or Garvin
or anyone else.

715
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:13,291
I only wish to help.

716
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,500
To find a cure
for the illness.

717
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:18,208
I was very close.

718
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:22,041
I must continue my work,
but it will take time.

719
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:26,458
How long until Skoran
and the others return?

720
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,583
I don't know.

721
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,750
They're looking for you now.

722
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:33,000
Then I must hurry.

723
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,458
Gia.

724
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,250
I believe
I found the answer.

725
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:01,125
Y-You found a cure?

726
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:03,375
I believe so.

727
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:06,166
I tested this medicine
on skin samples

728
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,834
from your father.

729
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:11,709
They showed improvement, so
I administered this to him.

730
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,667
He is now recovering.

731
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:16,125
What ki...

732
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,250
What kind of medicine
is it?

733
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:20,000
A compound I made

734
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:22,041
which will neutralize
the particles

735
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,208
that are making you ill.

736
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,166
Swallow this.

737
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:33,250
I must administer this
to everyone in the village.

738
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,166
But I do not think
they will trust me

739
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,291
after what happened
to Skoran.

740
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,625
I... I could tell them.

741
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:43,083
I am afraid they will not
believe you, either.

742
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:48,333
Gia... is the well
in the town square

743
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,792
the only source of water
for the village?

744
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:52,834
Well?

745
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,625
This is very
important.

746
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:58,959
Are there any other sources of
fresh water near the village?

747
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,834
No...

748
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:05,291
th-the nearest river...

749
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,125
two days away.

750
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:11,375
Then I will put this compound
into the well water.

751
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:13,333
It may be diluted,

752
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,458
but it should still have
enough potency to work.

753
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,083
Compound...

754
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,792
SKORAN:
There he is!

755
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,083
You see?

756
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,542
It's just as I said.

757
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:18,083
I only wish to help.

758
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,208
This is how
you've helped us?

759
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,166
By bringing this plague?

760
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,875
Tried to kill us all?

761
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:26,667
Well, you won't
succeed.

762
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:28,291
I won't let you!

763
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:32,333
(<i> grunting</i> )

764
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:32,458
Excuse me.

765
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,959
We're looking
for a friend of ours.

766
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,709
He might have wandered
into your village

767
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,959
a few days ago.

768
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,417
You'd remember him.

769
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,625
He would have appeared
very strange.

770
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:43,166
Pale skin, gold eyes.

771
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,291
He was your friend?

772
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:46,375
Yes. Do you know him?

773
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:50,542
Where is he?

774
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,166
I don't understand.

775
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:04,250
We didn't know his real name,
so we called him Jayden.

776
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:06,000
Are you saying he's dead?

777
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,875
They killed him
because they were afraid of him.

778
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:13,417
But he saved us all
from the sickness.

779
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,500
The sickness?

780
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:17,000
There were these...

781
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,625
pieces of metal.

782
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:20,542
They made everyone sick.

783
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:23,625
But Jayden put something
in the water,

784
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:25,250
and now
everyone's better.

785
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:27,375
What happened
to these pieces of metal?

786
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:30,041
We buried them
in the forest.

787
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,000
What was his real name?

788
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:36,583
Data.

789
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:39,458
Data.

790
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:44,041
He was my friend, too.

791
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:04,583
(<i> beeping</i> )

792
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,542
It's Data, all right.

793
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,333
He's buried about
two meters down.

794
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:10,583
He's been deactivated,

795
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:13,250
so I can't tell
how bad the damage is.

796
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:14,834
We could beam him and
the probe fragments

797
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,417
right onto the ship.

798
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:17,750
No one would know.

799
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,542
DR. CRUSHER:
Positronic net on line.

800
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:27,166
Subprocessor relays in place

801
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:30,375
and neuroelectrical
systems enabled.

802
00:42:35,709 --> 00:42:39,417
Data, are you
all right?

803
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:40,875
I do not know.

804
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:44,375
I am surprised
to find myself here.

805
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:47,000
I thought
I was on Barkon IV.

806
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:50,333
What's the last
thing you remember?

807
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,917
I had located the crashed
Federation probe

808
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:57,250
and collected
the radioactive fragments.

809
00:42:57,291 --> 00:43:00,625
I was attempting
to download the sensor logs

810
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,750
from the probe's
on-board computer

811
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:05,709
when there was a power surge.

812
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:10,000
I believe the surge
overloaded my positronic matrix.

813
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:12,291
After that...

814
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:15,291
I have no memory
until this moment.

815
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:21,583
But it appears
I had an interesting time.

816
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,166
RIKER:
We don't know much about
what happened, either.

817
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:26,542
Apparently, you saved
an entire village

818
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,208
from radiation poisoning.

819
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,125
And you were a very special
friend to a little girl.

820
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:37,959
Well...

821
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,250
if you'll excuse me, um...
I have the Bridge this watch.

822
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:47,417
Counselor, have you been
promoted in my absence?

823
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,917
That's right.

824
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,542
Which means, from now on,
you can call me "sir."

825
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,291
Yes, sir.
