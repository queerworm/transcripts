00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:05,875
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41242.4:</i>

2
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:07,917
<i>Our last assignment</i>
<i>has taken us</i>

3
00:00:07,917 --> 00:00:10,166
<i>into the remote</i>
<i>Omicron Theta star system</i>

4
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:14,500
<i>home of our android crew member</i>
<i>Lieutenant Commander Data.</i>

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
<i>Although we are due</i>
<i>at our next assignment</i>

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,792
<i>I have decided</i>
<i>to visit Data's home planet</i>

7
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:21,208
<i>for a few hours</i>
<i>in the hopes of unraveling</i>

8
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:24,667
<i>some of the mystery</i>
<i>of his beginnings.</i>

9
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:27,291
Sir, we are now 20 minutes
from Omicron Theta.

10
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,750
Mark.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,208
Stand by for subwarp.

12
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,583
Head for standard orbit
of Data's planet.

13
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,333
I wonder why Data
hasn't come up here.

14
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,250
He said he wanted
to be alone.

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,709
Perhaps this is

16
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:41,208
a bigger moment for
him than we thought.

17
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,875
Ah...

18
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,291
ah...

19
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,083
Data.

20
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,458
...choo!

21
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,333
What are you doing?

22
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,792
Sneezing.

23
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:57,542
Have you got a cold?

24
00:00:57,542 --> 00:00:59,083
A cold what?

25
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,458
It's a disease my mom
says people used to get.

26
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,709
Ah...

27
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,291
but humans still sneeze
for other reasons

28
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,709
and I cannot seem
to do it right.

29
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,500
Ah... ah...

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,917
How can you be practicing
something like sneezing

31
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:15,667
when we're arriving
at your home planet

32
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:16,875
for the first time?

33
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,500
Aren't you interested
in that?

34
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,041
More than interested--
fascinated.

35
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,667
One might say agog.

36
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,000
But I also find
sneezing interesting.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,208
Choo!

38
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:29,000
Chh...

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Captain Picard wishes
to see you on the Bridge.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,125
YAR:
Captain, confirming Class M
reading there, but...

41
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,458
but the sensors aren't showing
any life readings...

42
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,709
not even vegetation.

43
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,208
Strange.

44
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,917
The cruiser that found Data
reported farmlands there.

45
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:48,208
Do you want to take her
into orbit, Data?

46
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,000
No, thank you, sir.

47
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:16,250
Continue on
into close parking orbit.

48
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,083
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir.

49
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,208
I could say "home
sweet home," sir

50
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,542
if I understood
how the word
"sweet" applies.

51
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,750
It usually refers to memories.

52
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,625
It usually refers
to one's own memories, Captain.

53
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,834
Do the memories you have
include farms, Data?

54
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:33,208
Affirmative, sir

55
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,583
but the colony's
principal interest
was science.

56
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,750
YAR:
Data, I don't understand
how you can hold

57
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,667
the memories of 411 people

58
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:42,500
if that means every experience,
every day of their life...?

59
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,083
It does not,
unfortunately.

60
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,667
It means only the knowledge
they had accumulated.

61
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,875
Actually, I'm quite deficient
in some basic human information.

62
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,125
Sneezing, for example.

63
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:55,125
Sneezing?

64
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,709
Approaching close parking orbit.

65
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,458
Assemble your away party,
Commander.

66
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:03,291
This must be an exciting
time for you, Mr. Data.

67
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,750
I'm tempted to lead
the away team myself

68
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,166
except that my first officer
would object.

69
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,959
How would Starfleet
judge me if I didn't?

70
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,917
An entire Earth colony
did disappear down there.

71
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,166
You see?

72
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:18,250
Now in close parking orbit, sir.

73
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,875
Mr. Data...

74
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,667
welcome home.

75
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:51,875
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

76
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,792
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

77
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:57,667
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

78
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:01,250
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

79
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,000
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,917
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

81
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:17,166
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 4124.5:</i>

82
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,083
<i>We have found Data's home</i>
<i>to be a completely dead world</i>

83
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,166
<i>down to lifeless vegetation.</i>

84
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,667
<i>No insects--</i>
<i>not even soil bacteria.</i>

85
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,333
<i>What is it</i>

86
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,458
<i>that could kill everything</i>
<i>on an entire planet?</i>

87
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,750
Recording signal locked
onto the<i> Enterprise,</i> sir.

88
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,333
This looks like anything
but farmland.

89
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,250
Agreed, sir.

90
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,208
The soil appears almost
completely lifeless.

91
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,291
This is the exact position
in the<i> Tripoli</i> log.

92
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,959
Do you recognize
anything, Data?

93
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,959
The land contours
are familiar, sir.

94
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,792
Topographically,
this is the correct area.

95
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,208
This once was rich farmland

96
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,917
I'd say something like
20 to 30 years ago.

97
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:02,542
I was discovered
26 years ago.

98
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,834
Commander, I'd say that
everything on this planet

99
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:08,041
was either dead or dying
at the time Data was found.

100
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:12,458
I was found 20 meters
in that direction, sir.

101
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,709
YAR:
Data, any idea at all

102
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:22,667
why you were given
the colonists' memories?

103
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,709
I've always felt
that it was done hurriedly

104
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,375
but I know little more.

105
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,875
Here, sir.

106
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,792
This is where the cruiser's
landing party

107
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:33,917
found the signal device
that led them here.

108
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:37,750
And they found
me lying there.

109
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:44,166
You were just lying
out there in the open?

110
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,125
No identity record,
no instructions?

111
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,625
Only a layer of dust.

112
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,166
What's the first thing
you remember, Data?

113
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,000
Opening my eyes...

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,583
looking into the eyes
of the<i> Tripoli</i> landing party.

115
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,291
They believed
that the signal device

116
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,166
sensed their presence
and activated me.

117
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:06,166
Then this very spot
was your birthplace.

118
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:08,709
LA FORGE:
Commander.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,041
I think I've got
this place figured out here.

120
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:17,834
This was very cleverly done
to make this look

121
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:20,417
like a natural hollow
in the terrain here.

122
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:23,667
There are signs of it
being constructed in a hurry

123
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,375
as if to hide something here.

124
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,750
Yes, that was it, Geordi.

125
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,709
This awakens
a memory remnant

126
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,917
of how the colonists
hoped to remain hidden

127
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,709
but their fear
of being discovered

128
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:40,125
led to their storing information
in me.

129
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,750
Yeah, thought so.

130
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:11,458
(<i> lights powering up</i> )

131
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:18,375
No life readings
in here either, sir.

132
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:19,917
The colonists' laboratory--
extremely well-equipped.

133
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,125
Does this stir
any memories, Data?

134
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,083
Only a vague impression

135
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,583
of some of my functions
being tested here.

136
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:34,083
Posted by proud parents?

137
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:39,041
It depicts something
that feels familiar, sir

138
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,375
and dangerous

139
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,959
but I have no idea
what it represents.

140
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,291
And that is all

141
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,208
except...

142
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,333
for an impression

143
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:56,417
of this
being a Dr. Soong's work area.

144
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,291
Who?

145
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,417
You don't mean
Dr. Noonien Soong?

146
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,917
He was called
that here,

147
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,500
but his memories indicate

148
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
he traveled here
under a different name.

149
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,208
Dr. Noonien Soong,
my friend,

150
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,625
happens to have been
Earth's foremost
robotics scientist.

151
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,542
Until he tried
to make Asimov's dream

152
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,583
of a positronic brain
come true.

153
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,375
A positronic brain...

154
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,083
He promised so much

155
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,959
and then when he failed
completely,

156
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,792
Dr. Soong disappeared.

157
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:24,875
Now we know he went somewhere
else to try a second time.

158
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,417
Data, Geordi, we'll get
a close look at this lab.

159
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,500
You and Lieutenant Worf
reconnoiter

160
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,208
where those corridors lead.

161
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,500
Aye, sir.

162
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,542
LA FORGE:
Data, it's you.

163
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,291
RIKER:
An epidermal mold--

164
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,125
made to give your exterior
the desired finish.

165
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,208
Lieutenant Yar
to Commander Riker.

166
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,458
Come in, Lieutenant.

167
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,041
Sir, this installation
is big enough

168
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,291
to hold hundreds of people,

169
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,166
but all that's here now
is empty beds.

170
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,709
Thank you,
Lieutenant.

171
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:25,458
Complete your record scans
and report back here.

172
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:29,333
LA FORGE:
Commander Riker, looks like
some sort of storage area.

173
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,500
How many more
Datas are there?

174
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,083
Looks like just these two.

175
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:54,291
I mean, that and the real Data.

176
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,917
Commander...

177
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:11,542
can this be another me?

178
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:15,166
Or possibly my brother?

179
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,500
I honestly don't
know, Data.

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,333
He needs assembling.

181
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,625
RIKER:
He...

182
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,917
Data, we don't know that
this can become alive.

183
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:34,500
It is very important
for me to know that, sir.

184
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,792
I never dreamed it was possible

185
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:43,041
that I might find some link
with a form like my own.

186
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,583
Understood.

187
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,458
We'll take it back
to the ship with us.

188
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:58,166
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41242.45:</i>

189
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,792
<i>Despite having only a few hours</i>

190
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,834
<i>in which to explore</i>
<i>Data's home planet,</i>

191
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,667
<i>we have discovered something</i>

192
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,375
<i>which may explain</i>
<i>Data's beginnings</i>

193
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,583
if<i> we can properly assemble</i>

194
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,625
<i>and communicate</i>
<i>with what we've found.</i>

195
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,458
Signal from the Captain.

196
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,417
They need you
at the debriefing.

197
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:52,875
I've been most anxious to hear

198
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,166
the chief engineer's opinion,
Mr. Argyle.

199
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,583
Do you believe
he can be made to function?

200
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,041
It appears to include
all the components
in your body.

201
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,125
Not that we fully
understand your
construction either.

202
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,208
We have our top specialists

203
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,083
working on its
construction, Mr. Data.

204
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,500
Just one thing.

205
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,250
Without disassembling
you, of course

206
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,667
if we should
need more...

207
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:20,041
If we should need
to compare this

208
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,625
with the way
you're put together...

209
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,375
Bringing it up here

210
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,709
was the right thing
to do, Number One.

211
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,417
We were just saying, Data,

212
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,417
that if your duplicate
functions,

213
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,458
it may answer
a lot of questions.

214
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:43,834
Does it appear
to have, uh...

215
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:46,667
all your parts?

216
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,667
Completely, sir.

217
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,208
LA FORGE:
Will...

218
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:54,417
will we know how
to turn it on?

219
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,583
PICARD:
All right.

220
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,000
All right.

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,166
Legitimate questions
about any of this

222
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,166
need not be asked
apologetically.

223
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,750
You feel uncomfortable

224
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,709
on aspects
of your duplicate, Data.

225
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:08,792
We feel uncomfortable, too,
and for no logical reason.

226
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,041
If it feels awkward
to be reminded

227
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,750
that Data is a machine,

228
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,792
just remember that we are merely
a different variety of machine.

229
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,709
In our case,
electro-chemical in nature.

230
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:22,333
Let's begin to handle this
as we would do anything else.

231
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,625
Agreed, Captain.

232
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:27,583
Let's begin with you, Data.

233
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,583
Well, sir,
a good starting point may be

234
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,500
why was I given human form?

235
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,458
Well, to make it
easier for humans

236
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,542
to relate to you--
had to be.

237
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,291
But your designer
may have had

238
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,125
something else
to prove as well.

239
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,667
That human-shaped robots

240
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,792
need not be clumsy or limited
in their performance.

241
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:46,083
You certainly operate
as well as we do, Data.

242
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,375
Better in some ways, sir.

243
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,959
RIKER:
You might want to have
a look at this, Captain.

244
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,125
It could be a link to the
disappearance of the colonists.

245
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,375
It was displayed in the lab--
no doubt by proud parents.

246
00:15:56,375 --> 00:16:00,000
It could be just
a child's imagination

247
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,083
but several children
did similar drawings.

248
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,959
Dr. Crusher to the Captain.

249
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,291
At this point, sir,

250
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,417
we very much need
Mr. Data's help.

251
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,834
He's on his way, Doctor.

252
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,500
ARGYLE:
Is the electromagnetic
synthemometer reading

253
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,709
positive or negative?

254
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,291
WOMAN:
Positive.

255
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,625
Press your fingers there,
Doctor.

256
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,125
There.

257
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,000
It operates almost as a switch.

258
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,250
And these small projections?

259
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,667
An android
alarm clock.

260
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,250
Is that amusing?

261
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,667
They time how long
I remain unconscious.

262
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,709
Are you certain
about us using

263
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,583
these heating
devices, Data?

264
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,917
I will feel nothing at all.

265
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,166
Marvelous.

266
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,208
It should all be
a lot simpler

267
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,625
once we see how your
circuitry's connected.

268
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:09,250
I won't mention
it to anyone.

269
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,667
You have my word.

270
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:13,792
If you had
an off switch, Doctor,

271
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:16,500
would you not
keep it secret?

272
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,792
I guess I would.

273
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,291
Yes, notice the
microcircuitry here

274
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,500
and here...

275
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,583
and then another

276
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,959
fibroid-like
connection here.

277
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,250
Let's close up.

278
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,166
It seemed
to go well

279
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,500
thanks to a look
inside Mr. Data

280
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,375
but there have been no signs
of consciousness yet.

281
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:14,375
RIKER:
It certainly is
a good match for Data, sir.

282
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,000
PICARD:
Do you think so, really?

283
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,333
I wonder which of them
was made first.

284
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,041
He was.

285
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,375
But they found him
to be imperfect

286
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,500
and I was made to replace him.

287
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:43,208
You may call me Lore.

288
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:56,750
But I am also troubled by it
describing you as imperfect.

289
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,417
Human language gives me
difficulty, too, sir.

290
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:02,709
Imperfect could mean that I lack
certain abilities he possesses.

291
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,166
Hmm, I wonder.

292
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,709
But the point of this is

293
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,542
whether you and it
have approximately

294
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,125
the same
capabilities.

295
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,333
We do, sir,

296
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,709
and your referring to him
as "it"

297
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:17,083
suggests that I, too,
fit into the category

298
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,333
of a thing.

299
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:22,542
Oh, uh, I... I see your point.

300
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,625
My apologies.

301
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,917
Gladly accepted, sir.

302
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,583
As for Lore's abilities,

303
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,000
his use of syntax
and grammar suggests

304
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,792
he was given
human memories

305
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:33,083
similar to my own.

306
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,834
And you have about equal
physical strength

307
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:36,000
and mental
abilities?

308
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,041
I believe so, sir.

309
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,333
Which requires that I now
ask you a very serious question.

310
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,750
Since the two of you

311
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,375
are closely related
to each other...

312
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,959
The answer, sir,

313
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:51,709
is that my loyalty is to you
and Starfleet, completely.

314
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,542
Thank you, Commander.

315
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,583
I was certain of that.

316
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,125
LA FORGE:
And helm control is here

317
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,417
with the ship's heading
being given in measurements

318
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,667
we call degrees--

319
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,875
360 of them
in a full circle this way.

320
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,000
Then you say mark.

321
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,583
On the nose.

322
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,792
Which separates it from
another full 360-degree circle

323
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:15,333
this way on a right angle
to this one.

324
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,333
So, by ordering a heading
so many degrees this way

325
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,166
and so many this way

326
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,625
the ship can travel
in any direction--

327
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,917
all three dimensions.

328
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,625
And the square
of a hypotenuse

329
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,166
to the right triangle...?

330
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:30,417
Is equal to the sum of
the square of the other two...

331
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,166
two something--

332
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,041
which I
once heard

333
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,458
but never understood.

334
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,500
All of which you will
learn more about

335
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,333
when the Captain
has approved

336
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,208
your being on
the Bridge.

337
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,250
Have I committed
an offense?

338
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,667
You will find that there are

339
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,083
many rules on starships
that must be learned.

340
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,291
You're very clever, Wesley.

341
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,500
I now have duties
to perform, correct?

342
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,625
Were you ever

343
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,625
this anxious
to please, Data?

344
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,083
Never.

345
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,875
I judge Lore to be superior
in that desire.

346
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,792
Because I was designed
to be so human, my brother.

347
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,458
I enjoy
pleasing humans.

348
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,166
LA FORGE:
"My brother."

349
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,667
That has a nice sound
to it, Data.

350
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:14,125
You consider it important
to please humans?

351
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,125
It's not important?

352
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,583
There are many things
of importance.

353
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,542
Some more than others.

354
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:37,583
Do you realize
that Commander Riker's

355
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,583
hypotenuse question
tricked you

356
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,417
into showing
your knowledge

357
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,625
was greater than you
were indicating?

358
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,542
He didn't seem
that clever.

359
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:47,125
I'll be more careful.

360
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,750
You tend to underestimate
humans, my brother.

361
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,125
Praising young Wesley
on the helm, for example.

362
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,291
A child.

363
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,959
He has a child's body,

364
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:59,125
but we have found him
to be much more.

365
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,709
Thank you for that
information, too.

366
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:06,000
You do care
about how I perform.

367
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,959
I pledge to be worthy

368
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:11,000
of your teaching,
my brother.

369
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,959
Try not to be jealous
of my ability.

370
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:34,208
What information
are you requesting?

371
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:38,250
Everything available
on a Dr. Noonien Soong.

372
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,834
Ah, good old
"Often Wrong" Soong.

373
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,417
A joke, brother.

374
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:48,166
Actually, he was

375
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,333
a genius by human standards.

376
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,458
But he destroyed
his own reputation

377
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,542
by making what seemed
wild promises

378
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:56,959
about his positronic
brain design--

379
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,750
almost all of which failed.

380
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,375
Promises he later proved
to be true.

381
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:07,959
Which made you and
me possible, brother.

382
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:13,375
Our beloved father.

383
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,792
Will I soon have a uniform

384
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,291
like that, brother?

385
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,291
If you get one
the way I did, Lore,

386
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,375
it will mean four years
at the Academy

387
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,041
another three as Ensign,

388
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,500
ten or 12 on varied space duty
in the Lieutenant grades...

389
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,500
A system designed to compensate
for limited human ability

390
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,166
and you, brother, are beginning
to think as a human.

391
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,166
You and I
are completely

392
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,000
different
from them.

393
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,500
Are you truly satisfied
with the knowledge and memory

394
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,000
of a few hundred
human colonists?

395
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,917
Suppose it could reflect
thousands

396
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,709
or millions

397
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:51,333
or the knowledge

398
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,875
of hundreds of millions
of life-forms of every kind?

399
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,583
How?

400
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,417
We will discuss that in time.

401
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:05,500
And will we also
discuss, Lore,

402
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,625
which of us
was constructed first?

403
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:13,333
It would be foolish
to underestimate you, brother.

404
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,375
Yes, I lied when I said

405
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,000
you were made first,
but with good reason.

406
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,333
Dr. Soong made me perfect
in his first attempt,

407
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,542
but he made me
so completely human

408
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:26,083
the colonists became envious
of me.

409
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,500
You lived with the colonists?

410
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,208
Until they petitioned Soong

411
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:36,458
to make a more comfortable,
less perfect android.

412
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,875
In other words, you...

413
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,041
brother.

414
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:45,625
Haven't you noticed

415
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,500
how easily I handle
human speech?

416
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,750
I use their contractions.

417
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,250
For example,
I say "can't"

418
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,875
or "isn't"

419
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:59,583
and you say "cannot"
and "is not."

420
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,917
♪ I say tomato, and you ♪

421
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,291
♪ Say tomahto ♪

422
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,125
♪ I say potato
and you say potahto... ♪

423
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,208
A very old joke.

424
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,917
But then you also have trouble
with their humor.

425
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:15,375
Am I right?

426
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:17,750
Quite true.

427
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,000
I keep trying
to be more human

428
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,875
and keep failing.

429
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:26,542
Do you realize, brother,

430
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:30,709
I can help you
become more human?

431
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,291
And do you realize, Lore,

432
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,792
that I am obligated
to report all of this

433
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:37,500
to our ship's Captain?

434
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,291
I assumed as much when I began
studying you.

435
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,500
May I use this
to learn more

436
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,250
about this vessel
and its customs?

437
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,250
Use it also to describe
for the Captain

438
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,041
the time you spent
among the colonists

439
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,500
including everything
you know

440
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,041
about what happened
to them.

441
00:25:55,041 --> 00:26:00,041
I promise a report
of great detail and accuracy.

442
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,625
Thank you, Lore.

443
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:04,375
I now have duties to perform.

444
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,750
Unless, of course,
you need something more.

445
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,083
I have more than I dreamed
possible, brother.

446
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:42,709
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41242.5:</i>

447
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:44,375
<i>Thanks to Lore's report,</i>

448
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:47,500
<i>we now know what happened</i>
<i>to the colonists.</i>

449
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,625
<i>Beginning with</i>

450
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,000
<i>enhanced by Lore's</i>
<i>description,</i>

451
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,875
<i>our computer has constructed</i>

452
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,125
<i>the image</i>
<i>of a great crystalline entity</i>

453
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:59,458
<i>which feeds on life,</i>
<i>insatiably ravenous</i>

454
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,583
<i>for the life force found</i>
<i>in living forms</i>

455
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:05,917
<i>capable of stripping all life</i>
<i>from an entire world.</i>

456
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:09,000
But how did Data
escape that thing? Or Lore?

457
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,583
Lore had been disassembled.

458
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:13,542
He explained it as jealousy
from the colonists

459
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:15,750
and Data wasn't yet alive
at that time.

460
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,000
Which explains why Data
could be left outside

461
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,500
in no danger
from that creature.

462
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,375
Whatever happened
to the colonists,

463
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,542
he would be found

464
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:23,959
by the first
Starfleet crew

465
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,417
that responded to
the signal he transmitted.

466
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:27,625
By which Dr. Soong
left proof behind

467
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:30,417
that his experiment did work.

468
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:31,792
Captain...

469
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:34,542
how believable do you find
that crystal thing?

470
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:38,208
With so little of even
our galaxy explored,

471
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,709
I find it
at least possible.

472
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:44,041
Data, are you expecting Lore
to come up here?

473
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,834
He left your quarters
some time ago.

474
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,208
To go?

475
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,959
My turbo sensors say
he went to Deck Four. Worf?

476
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,792
Where he examined
some microminiature work tools

477
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:54,750
and some fine grind
quadratanium.

478
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,500
Which is used in
our construction.

479
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,709
That particular compound
is no more suspicious, sir,

480
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:00,583
than a human looking
for an antiseptic

481
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:01,750
or an ointment.

482
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,500
Nevertheless,
I should check it out.

483
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,250
You're watching
everything he does, Data?

484
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,542
Is that the act
of a brother?

485
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:10,750
It's the act
of a Starfleet officer

486
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,417
obeying his Captain, Doctor.

487
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:21,500
Captain, speaking strictly
as security chief,

488
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,208
how much can you trust Data now?

489
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,166
I trust him completely,
Lieutenant,

490
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:34,125
but everyone should also realize
that that was a necessary

491
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:36,291
and legitimate
security question.

492
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:38,542
Thank you, sir.

493
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,542
(<i> door opens</i> )

494
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:04,500
Lesson number one
in becoming more human:

495
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,000
You must observe
all human customs.

496
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,583
Champagne?

497
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:13,000
An ancient ritual
still practiced

498
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,166
when they observe
events of importance.

499
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,750
My brother, I toast

500
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,834
our discovery
of each other.

501
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:32,166
May it fill our lives
with new meaning.

502
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:39,208
I have some doubts
about the value

503
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,208
of human customs...

504
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,417
in this...

505
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:48,208
Brother...

506
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:52,542
And let us toast,
also, Dr. Soong

507
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:56,166
who gave me
the full richness

508
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:59,250
of human needs and ambitions.

509
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,208
A perfect match for my mind,
my body.

510
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:07,750
Brother... help me.

511
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:15,583
And let us toast also
the great crystal entity

512
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:20,083
with whom I learned
to communicate.

513
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,834
Before Dr. Soong disassembled me

514
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:26,041
I earned its gratitude
by revealing

515
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,375
the way to the colonists.

516
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:30,917
Can you imagine its gratitude

517
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:34,375
when I give it the life
on this vessel?

518
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,667
This is strange, sir.

519
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,083
I show Commander Data

520
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,333
transmitting on
a subspace channel.

521
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,750
I know Data's been doing
considerable research

522
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,500
into Dr. Soong's
background.

523
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,125
Let's be sure.

524
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:54,333
Wesley, would you look in
on Commander Data, discreetly?

525
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,875
Yes, sir.

526
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,750
Crystal entity

527
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,500
upon arriving here

528
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,125
you can identify me
as the machine named Data.

529
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:12,208
(<i> door chime</i> )

530
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:14,208
End of message.

531
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,750
Come in, please.

532
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,917
Glad you were here, Wesley.

533
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:23,875
Lore suddenly attacked me
and I had to turn him off.

534
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,583
Why did he do that, Data?

535
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,792
He discovered
we have been using sensors

536
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,500
to follow what he does.

537
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:34,917
I practiced his facial tic.

538
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:36,542
Do I have it right?

539
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:39,667
I'd suggest
you forget imitating him.

540
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,208
If you'd said

541
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,875
<i>we've</i> been
using the sensors

542
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,291
instead of<i> we have</i>

543
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,583
I might have suspected
you were Lore.

544
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:49,542
Yes, I do use language
more formally than Lore.

545
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,125
Please inform the Captain

546
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,959
I will come up on the Bridge
and report on this.

547
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,500
Aye, sir.

548
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,250
Wes, tell me again

549
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,250
how Data said he
immobilized Lore.

550
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:07,208
He told me he just
turned him off, Mom...

551
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,166
uh, Doctor.

552
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,208
Question, Mr. Data.

553
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:18,041
Did you or did you not
swear me to secrecy

554
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,208
about your off switch?

555
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,208
A change of
mind, Doctor.

556
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,291
If I cannot trust
the Bridge crew,

557
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,667
whom can I?

558
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:29,083
Captain, I'm picking up
a bogey coming in

559
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,083
on a five
o'clock tangent.

560
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,917
YAR:
It's transmitting no ID signal,
Captain.

561
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:34,500
RIKER:
Set main viewer on that tangent.

562
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,250
PICARD:
Shields up; go to yellow alert.

563
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,542
Transmit friendly
greetings--

564
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:39,333
all languages,
all frequencies.

565
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,500
I can't believe anything's
overtaking us this fast.

566
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,875
Beautiful, isn't it?

567
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,709
I recognize it, sir.

568
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:57,208
It's the crystal image
Lore described.

569
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,667
My God.

570
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,750
YAR:
Still no ID
being transmitted, sir.

571
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,875
Also no answer
to our inquiries.

572
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:24,917
Did you get
a direct look at it?

573
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:26,542
It's like a giant
snowflake crystal

574
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,000
but much
more complex.

575
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,500
The entire
electromagnetic spectrum

576
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,000
seems to play
about inside it,

577
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,208
but I haven't the slightest
idea what it is, sir.

578
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:35,500
Thank you, Lieutenant.

579
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Data, if there's anything else
that Lore could tell us about it

580
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,291
it may be
important.

581
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,166
Can you control him enough
to question him?

582
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,917
I will have to examine
him to know, sir.

583
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,291
Captain, recommend
that you do not let...

584
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,500
<i>him</i> roam
the ship freely.

585
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Ensign.

586
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,250
Wesley is simply showing himself
to be alert and responsible,

587
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,917
something to be encouraged.

588
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:00,834
Come. You can watch
everything I do.

589
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:02,583
Not if I have a choice.

590
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,166
That is enough,
Ensign!

591
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:05,750
When addressing
a senior officer...

592
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,750
I've guided his training, sir.
I'm the one at fault.

593
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,000
You will show
the proper respect.

594
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,250
I will accompany you down there
to make certain of it.

595
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,750
With your approval,
of course, sir.

596
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,834
Careful of Lore.

597
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:37,875
Good, he is still unconscious.

598
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:41,959
Notice the same twitch
even though he is unconscious.

599
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,625
Stay back.

600
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:47,583
We may have problems if he
senses someone else is near.

601
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:52,917
Lore.

602
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,625
I have a few
questions to ask you.

603
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,667
Lore, it is Data.

604
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:01,834
He senses you.

605
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:05,125
I cannot control him
if you stay.

606
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,250
Please, I will record
everything he says.

607
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,083
And you bring it
to the Bridge immediately.

608
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:20,917
And you want to be
as stupid as them...

609
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:22,625
dear brother?

610
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:39,875
PICARD:
Well, Number One?

611
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:41,583
It was Lore, sir--

612
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,750
same facial twitches
that we've seen all along

613
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,375
lying unconscious on the floor
exactly as Data had described

614
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,667
and then it suddenly
became violent

615
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,583
apparently sensing
that Wesley and I were present.

616
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,959
Or is it Lore pretending
to be Data and faking it all?

617
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,875
I asked for Commander
Riker's report

618
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,208
<i>acting</i> Ensign Crusher

619
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,709
and since it now seems clear

620
00:36:57,709 --> 00:36:58,959
that you are unable
to function

621
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,250
within the limits
of that appointment...

622
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,500
Captain.

623
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:11,625
Deflector shields holding, sir.

624
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,500
Bring photon torpedoes
to ready.

625
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,959
Main phasers to ready.

626
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,834
Go to red alert, please.

627
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,792
Weapons now readied, sir.

628
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,500
No, Captain,
let me talk to it.

629
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,000
You didn't say
you could do that.

630
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,500
Affirmative. Talk to it.

631
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,583
Open hailing frequencies.

632
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:41,500
Crystal form,
I identify myself as Data.

633
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,458
Advising you
to stop your attack.

634
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,625
The humans here are powerful--

635
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,667
capable of injuring
or even destroying you.

636
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:59,750
Now I call
that communicating.

637
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,750
Suggest moving fast to
confirm what I told it, sir.

638
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,792
Permission to use
the large transporter

639
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:06,542
in Cargo Room Three.

640
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:08,959
There I can beam up
some living pattern,

641
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,542
perhaps
a large tree.

642
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:12,542
Which you'll beam over
next to the entity.

643
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,166
That is
correct, Riker.

644
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,291
Our ship's phasers will then
blast and disintegrate it

645
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:19,875
proving we are dangerous.

646
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,166
Make it so.

647
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,625
Sir?

648
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:27,250
Do it.

649
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:37,250
Sir, I know
this may finish me

650
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,333
as acting Ensign...

651
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:39,792
Shut up, Wesley.

652
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,458
Lieutenant, pick
a good security team

653
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:45,542
and let me
know what he does.

654
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:47,041
Aye, sir.

655
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,083
"Shut up, Wesley"?

656
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:51,208
Doctor...

657
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:53,625
And since
I am finished here, sir

658
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:54,875
may I
point out...

659
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,500
Shut up, Wesley.

660
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,750
That everything that I have said
would've been listened to

661
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,458
if it came from
an adult officer.

662
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:06,709
Request permission
to return to my quarters, sir.

663
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:09,709
Agreed. Doctor, go with him.

664
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:14,542
You're putting me
off the Bridge?

665
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:17,375
I'm asking you to keep
an eye on your son

666
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,041
during all
of this, Doctor.

667
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,417
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

668
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,458
Emergency close.

669
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:34,291
Now show me
your warrior fierceness.

670
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,917
I'll look.

671
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:58,959
But I shouldn't have let you
talk me into this.

672
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,542
Mom, it's Data!

673
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:01,792
He's been hurt.

674
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:06,583
It's Data, Mom.

675
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,959
I heard you know how
to turn them on.

676
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,917
This is very serious.

677
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:13,375
So just tell me
to "Shut up, Wesley"

678
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,333
and I will.

679
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,375
You're being
very unfair, Wes.

680
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,959
Data, the crystal thing
is outside

681
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,750
somewhere close to the ship

682
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,041
and Lore is loose
on the inside.

683
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,250
How badly are
you hurt, Data?

684
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:32,750
I will function sufficiently
to stop Lore, Doctor.

685
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:41,834
Crystal entity form,
it's your old friend.

686
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:52,208
Very good.

687
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:55,083
You've understood perfectly
so far.

688
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,041
Next I will signal

689
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:58,709
that I'm about to transport
something out

690
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,917
at which time
the deflector shields

691
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,917
will turn off for a moment

692
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:05,208
and if you move
in at that time

693
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,458
it...

694
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,834
How sad, dear brother.

695
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:13,542
You make me wish
I were an only child.

696
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:24,792
Then why this marvelous gift?

697
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:29,125
The troublesome
little man-child.

698
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:32,834
Are you prepared for the kind of
death you've earned, little man?

699
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:36,583
If you take one more step
towards my son...

700
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:39,792
Ah... motherhood.

701
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:44,750
Back off

702
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,542
or I'll turn
your little man

703
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,041
into a torch.

704
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:50,583
I promise him exquisite pain

705
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,125
unless you obey
me, too, brother.

706
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,250
Move away, Data.

707
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,875
Please.

708
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:58,333
Do you see now

709
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:02,417
the advantages
of being completely human?

710
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:04,875
It includes kindness.

711
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:08,041
I give you
your life, Doctor.

712
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:10,000
Go quickly

713
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,333
and I may not injure
your son at all.

714
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,542
I will stay with Wesley, Doctor.

715
00:42:15,542 --> 00:42:16,959
Go!

716
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,250
Or he'll be
shrieking

717
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,250
by the count
of five.

718
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,792
One

719
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,166
two

720
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,709
three

721
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,667
four...

722
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:31,959
Thank you for my
human qualities, Dr. Soong.

723
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:34,083
Wait!

724
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:37,834
A small payment
for your son's misdeeds.

725
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,458
Wes, the transporter.

726
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:06,125
Wesley, now!

727
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:27,625
Lore's gone, sir. Permanently.

728
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:38,750
Doctor, now that Wesley's safe,
go to Sick Bay at once.

729
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,500
Captain, that crystal thing
has begun to move away.

730
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:55,500
Data, you all right?

731
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,750
Yes, sir, I'm fine.

732
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:01,709
Then get rid
of that damned twitch

733
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:03,500
and put on a correct uniform.

734
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,333
Yes, Captain.

735
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:08,375
Ensign Crusher,
you able to return to duty?

736
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:09,458
Yes, sir.

737
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,917
Then do so

738
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:13,250
and let the Bridge know
that all is well down here.

739
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,417
Aye, sir.

740
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:20,125
RIKER:
It's gone, sir.

741
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,250
Without Lore,
it had no way to reach us.

742
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,500
And we're overdue
for our computer refit.

743
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,750
Number One,
have you ever considered

744
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,083
whether Data is more human

745
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,083
or less human
than we want?

746
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,792
I only wish we were all
as well-balanced, sir.

747
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:35,333
Agreed.
