00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:06,583
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42686.4.</i>

2
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,875
<i>We are en route</i>
<i>to Starbase</i> Montgomery

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,667
<i>for engineering consultations</i>

4
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,709
<i>prompted by minor readout</i>
<i>anomalies.</i>

5
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,834
I would consider them
insignificant.

6
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:21,208
What if you're wrong?

7
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,041
Sorry.

8
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,208
But what if it is more
than mere discrepancy?

9
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,458
Then I'd say we have a problem.

10
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,667
Agreed. We will have
Starbase<i> Montgomery</i>

11
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,500
give us
an independent reading.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,458
Even if the molecular level
controls have failed,

13
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,417
we can still recrystalize
the dilithium

14
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:36,625
without
outside help.

15
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:37,917
Don't worry, Data.

16
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:39,208
My ego isn't
at stake here.

17
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,709
Perhaps we can
reprogram

18
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,917
the system to correct
the readout variables.

19
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,625
Well, that's certainly
another option.

20
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,750
But as we are stopping at
Starbase<i> Montgomery</i> anyway,

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,625
we'll let them
do the analysis.

22
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,125
I don't recall
Starbase<i> Montgomery</i>

23
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,834
being on the mission
itinerary.

24
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:58,208
I think we could all use
a 12-hour layover.

25
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,166
Besides, I've just received some
personal transfer directives,

26
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,625
priority matter.

27
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:03,917
Boarding or disembarking?

28
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,458
WESLEY:
Captain Picard.

29
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,375
We're within hailing range
of Starbase<i> Montgomery.</i>

30
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,417
Go to half impulse power.

31
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,917
Uh, will you join me
in the observation lounge

32
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:13,041
when you're done?

33
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,458
Captain.

34
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,834
Number one, I've just
been recollecting

35
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:35,792
the arrival of a new first
officer on board the<i> Enterprise</i>

36
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:40,834
and a manual docking,
confidently achieved.

37
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,291
Well, I may have been
somewhat miserly

38
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,792
in my congratulations
then,

39
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:47,500
so let me make up
for it now.

40
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:54,208
The captain of
the Starship<i> Aries</i> is retiring.

41
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,083
Congratulations.

42
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,083
You've been selected
as his replacement.

43
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,500
The<i> Aries.</i> She's
in the Vega-Omicron sector.

44
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,792
Mm-hmm, and they have
picked up indications

45
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:04,959
of an intelligent life-form,

46
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,750
though nothing confirmed.

47
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,000
Obviously Starfleet
will want to know more.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,583
Well, that's why they're
asking for you.

49
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,750
Not for your
military proficiency

50
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,834
but for your skill
as an explorer

51
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,750
and as a diplomat.

52
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,250
Vega-Omicron.

53
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,959
That'll take months at high warp
just to get to there.

54
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,667
With no guarantee of finding
anything when you arrive.

55
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,500
Well, you have 12 hours
to think it over.

56
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,083
And if it's not
too premature,

57
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,458
congratulations, Captain.

58
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,792
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

59
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:06,166
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

60
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

61
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:11,834
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

62
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:16,375
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

63
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:20,458
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

64
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,834
Establish synchronous orbit.

65
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,041
WESLEY:
Aye, sir.

66
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,125
Starbase<i> Montgomery</i> is sending
a civilian advisor on board

67
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,125
to brief you
on the<i> Aries's</i> mission.

68
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,375
A personal briefing?

69
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,458
Mm-hmm.
A strategic attaché

70
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,667
with a specialized knowledge
in the frontier regions.

71
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,959
I think you'll find
the briefing interesting.

72
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,458
I hope it's complete.

73
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,583
Much of my decision
will be based on it.

74
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,709
O'BRIEN:
Commander Riker
to transporter room three.

75
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,458
Enjoy.

76
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,125
Ensign.

77
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,834
Ah, you're right on time,
Commander.

78
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,583
He's on his way now.

79
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:19,041
Dad.

80
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,125
You're the civilian advisor,
in the strategic attaché?

81
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,417
I asked Captain Picard
to keep it quiet.

82
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:29,291
I didn't want to make you
nervous, excited.

83
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,792
It's been 15 years.

84
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:33,333
Excitement is hardly
the appropriate emotion.

85
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,166
You've done well.

86
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,250
First officer
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

87
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,166
Quite a feather in your cap.

88
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,750
I've worked hard.

89
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,625
Of course.
I'm proud of you, son.

90
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,875
If you'll excuse me,
I've got my duties to attend to.

91
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:53,083
When you've settled in,
we can complete our briefing.

92
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,333
Have security arrange
an escort for this gentleman.

93
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,709
Aye, sir.

94
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,583
Worf, did you hear about
Commander Riker's promotion?

95
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,375
Yes.
He didn't know his
father was coming.

96
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,083
He was completely
surprised...
So?

97
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,417
Can you imagine
if it was your father?

98
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,959
I never knew my father.

99
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,709
And I didn't have a father
long enough to know him...

100
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,667
It is a waste of time
to think of such things.

101
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:24,875
I wasn't thinking about it,
but everybody needs somebody.

102
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,291
Enough!

103
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,750
You know, Starbase<i> Montgomery</i>

104
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,500
really didn't have
to send me all this help

105
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,333
because I've already checked
the entire dilithium spectrum

106
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,667
for anomalous frequencies.

107
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,625
So you don't have to waste
your time on that.

108
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,834
Wes...

109
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,625
You okay?

110
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,875
I was just talking
to Worf.

111
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,041
Yeah?

112
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,291
He's really eccentric
at times.

113
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,667
That's one word for it.

114
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,625
He was really upset.

115
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,041
I must have said
something wrong.

116
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,583
Maybe Worf's just not too
thrilled with the prospect

117
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,834
of losing Commander Riker
to a new assignment.

118
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:05,959
I know I'm not.

119
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,333
Neither am I.

120
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,417
But with Worf,
it was something else.

121
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,125
Something's really
bothering him.

122
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,333
Think so, huh?

123
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:27,834
Female?

124
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:28,959
No.

125
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,375
Career?

126
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,333
Career?

127
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,750
Family.

128
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,709
That is trouble.

129
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:38,500
You choose your enemies,
you choose your friends.

130
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,709
But family...
that's in the stars.

131
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,750
So I've heard.

132
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,834
Kyle Riker!

133
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:54,333
Excuse me,
ladies.

134
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,333
Great to see you.

135
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,667
Kyle!
It's been a long time.

136
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:21,166
This is more than a surprise,
it's total shock.

137
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,208
You mean you didn't
bake me a cake?

138
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,500
You're actually here.

139
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,792
That makes two of us.

140
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:28,875
How about a drink?

141
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,375
How about a kiss?

142
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,709
They know each other.

143
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,000
No kidding.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,250
Well, I know her, too,
but we don't do that.

145
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,667
(<i> chuckling</i> )

146
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,417
You look wonderful.

147
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
DATA:
And it has nothing to do

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,583
with Commander Riker's
new assignment?

149
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,166
No, his reaction was just
the opposite of mine--

150
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,583
completely unaffected.

151
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,333
See, Wes?
With all that's going on,

152
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,125
maybe you're
overreacting.

153
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,667
Really?

154
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,792
You try talking
to Worf, Geordi.

155
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:14,500
I'm telling you,
he is not normal for Worf.

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,792
There is of course
a genetic predisposition

157
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:20,000
toward hostility
among all Klingons,

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,417
but Worf has been
unusually out of sorts.

159
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:26,166
Come on, he's never
been much on charm.

160
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,834
Well, whatever's troubling him,
I think we should try to help.

161
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,083
He is our friend.

162
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,041
I, for one, want
to keep him friendly.

163
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,750
Suggestions?

164
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,583
Empirical study.
Monitor the subject.

165
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:42,458
Right, watch the subject for
any signs of unusual behavior.

166
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,917
That won't be difficult.

167
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,166
Within the norm of Klingon
patterns, of course.

168
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,583
Discretion will be required.

169
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,041
Agreed.
When do we start?

170
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,458
<i>We</i> will assist<i> you</i>
as needed.

171
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,250
You found the problem.

172
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,333
And you must solve it.

173
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,583
(<i> indistinct chatter</i> )

174
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,834
Thank you.

175
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,667
And after working out
the Fuurinkazan

176
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,250
battle strategies
at the Tokyo base,

177
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,834
I was asked to come here
to work for Starfleet

178
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,542
as a tactical advisor.

179
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,375
I'm surprised you stayed out
of action as long as you did.

180
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,000
Will, please join us.

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,750
Your father and I are
just catching up.

182
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,417
You never told me
you knew him.

183
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,583
Well, it wasn't
exactly a secret.

184
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,542
It just never really
came up.

185
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,250
Sit down, son.

186
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,750
I'm ready for that briefing
whenever you are.

187
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,417
It was a pleasure.

188
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:58,917
Good to see you,
too, Graham.

189
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:00,333
Mm-hmm.

190
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:03,750
You wouldn't be running
for mayor, would you?

191
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,750
Do pick-up work for
the Federation long enough,

192
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,500
and it'll happen
to you, too.

193
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,834
I thought about you a lot.

194
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:15,125
Kyle, I don't need to hear
what you don't need to say.

195
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,083
We could have been
great together.

196
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,041
Possibly.

197
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,709
Is it true you got married?

198
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:21,834
Again.

199
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,208
And again.

200
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,500
That makes you three
for three, doesn't it?

201
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not complaining.

202
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,125
Each was a good man,

203
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,625
and we're all
still good friends.

204
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,959
Like us?

205
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,041
Close, but different.

206
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,583
They were all a little more
in touch with themselves.

207
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,166
Ah, ouch.

208
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,417
Face facts, Kyle.
You're crusty.

209
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,375
You have a reputation
for being hard as nails

210
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,875
and getting
the job done.

211
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,166
But underneath it all,
you're not so bad.

212
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,250
Some of us even love you.

213
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,750
And then there's Will.

214
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,542
Then there's Will.

215
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,542
You know, Wesley should really
be doing this on his own.

216
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:06,667
But he needs
his study time.

217
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:09,333
I can't believe
you fell for that.

218
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,458
I don't know, Data,
he looks perfectly normal to me.

219
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:20,583
In solitude, there is nothing
to trigger unusual behavior.

220
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,750
Good point.

221
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,083
Let's not tamper
with the status quo.

222
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,000
But that would defeat
the opportunity

223
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,875
for our
behavioral research.

224
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,917
In all probability,
he is simply lonely.

225
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:36,792
We can relieve his anxiety
through socialization.

226
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:39,000
Be my guest.

227
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,208
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

228
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:52,750
You seem to have lost the will
to communicate with others.

229
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,750
You have friends here.

230
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,333
We...

231
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,041
we care about you.

232
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,125
Why, just recently, Geordi,
Wesley, and I were saying...

233
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,542
With all due respect...

234
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,000
Be gone!

235
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,792
Sir.

236
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,583
He seems quite sincere
in his desire for solitude.

237
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,792
Seeing is
believing, huh?

238
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:29,917
Hm.

239
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,500
(<i> door chimes</i> )

240
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,750
Come in.

241
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,500
Worf.

242
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,208
May I have a moment, sir?

243
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,208
Of course.
What is it?

244
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,834
It is very
difficult to say.

245
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:06,750
Words are not always
easy for me.

246
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,834
Is that Earth?

247
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,333
Yes, Alaska.

248
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,291
I was nine years old.

249
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,792
That is a fish
you are holding.

250
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,709
And I didn't even catch it.

251
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:21,500
But it looks like
you were...

252
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,750
Hooked it.

253
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,959
My father took the rod away.

254
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,291
He wouldn't let me
reel it in.

255
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,417
He was afraid
that I would lose it.

256
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:31,875
You do not have good
feelings for your father?

257
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,000
No, I...

258
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,542
Well...

259
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm not sure what I'm feeling.

260
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,875
What's on your mind?

261
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,542
You plan to leave
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

262
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:50,375
I've been offered
my own command.

263
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,875
I would like to join you.

264
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,208
I haven't accepted
the assignment yet.

265
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,750
But, sir, it could
be a dangerous mission.

266
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,291
There may be
the potential for combat.

267
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,125
That is not the purpose
of the mission.

268
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,083
Still, to die
a true hero...

269
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,625
Worf.

270
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,583
You've made
your point.

271
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,959
Then I know you will
do the right thing.

272
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,792
Finally, we're alone.

273
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,625
Maybe now we can talk.

274
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,959
I'm here for
the briefing, sir.

275
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,500
All you need to know is here.

276
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,250
These mission details
could have been transmitted.

277
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:56,166
I've been hearing
some good things about you.

278
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,750
And why haven't
I heard from you?

279
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,083
I know, keeping in touch
is not my strong suit.

280
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,333
It's a funny thing
about being a parent.

281
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,792
There aren't
any tech manuals.

282
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,250
No quick readouts
to get you through

283
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,542
the next set
of variables.

284
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:14,208
You just got to wing it
from day to day.

285
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,834
Will, when
your mother died...

286
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,208
Excuse me.

287
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,834
I've got to study
this mission briefing.

288
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,458
Will.

289
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,041
I came
to the<i> Enterprise</i>

290
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,458
because...

291
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,583
Look, considering where you
might be going, I wanted to...

292
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:36,291
I'm here with
my hand out, son.

293
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,834
Poor guy,
picked up the flu virus

294
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:00,959
at our last stop
at Nasreldine.

295
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,834
Sounds nasty.
What's the therapy?

296
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,375
Tryptophan-lysine
distillates

297
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:08,291
with a generous dose
of P.C.S.

298
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,083
P.C.S.?

299
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,875
Pulaski's Chicken Soup.

300
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,125
(<i> laughing</i> )

301
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,542
You haven't lost your touch,
have you?

302
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:17,417
I like to help.
When they hurt, I hurt.

303
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:22,000
TROI:
Dr. Pulaski's greatest medical
skill is her empathy.

304
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,959
You must be Commander
Riker's father.

305
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,458
Yes, but how...

306
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:29,041
We've heard about you,
and I felt certain things.

307
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,250
This is Deanna Troi,
ship's counselor.

308
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,333
Kyle Riker.

309
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,208
I thought
you two should meet.

310
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,625
Deanna's job is
to keep us from

311
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,458
deluding ourselves.

312
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,959
Let me guess.
Betazoid?

313
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,834
At your service.

314
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:46,000
I have some lab work to do.
If you'll excuse me.

315
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,291
Why do I get the feeling
that this is a setup?

316
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:54,667
Because you are intelligent,
wise, and quite correct.

317
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:59,250
Well I've never been setup
better, that's for sure.

318
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,875
You're also very
anxious about something.

319
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,333
It's Will, isn't it?

320
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,458
You are not as close to him
as you'd like to be.

321
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,542
Oh, I don't know.

322
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:15,917
We both have pretty good taste
in women, wouldn't you say?

323
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:22,166
I'd like to help you,
if I can.

324
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,834
If you'll let me.

325
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:26,166
Fine. What is it
you want from me?

326
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,667
I came here to bury
the hatchet with my son

327
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:33,291
only to find out that
the ground was frozen solid.

328
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,834
You don't seem to be
the kind to give up so easily.

329
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:39,875
I didn't say
I was giving up.

330
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:43,208
It would just be nice to get
a little something from him.

331
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,166
What is it
you want from him?

332
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,417
I don't know.

333
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,041
Acknowledgement,
maybe or...

334
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,709
Respect is earned,
not bestowed.

335
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,208
Respect?

336
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,333
I don't need that from him.

337
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,709
Perhaps you want him
to be proud of you.

338
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:01,166
You carry great pride
in his accomplishments.

339
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,667
Absolutely.

340
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:05,709
Look at him. First officer
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

341
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,166
Just been offered
his first command.

342
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,500
Yet, you covet his success.

343
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,291
Please.

344
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,125
He'd be lucky to have
the career I've had.

345
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,166
True, you are well-respected
in your field.

346
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,041
I may have something
of a reputation for excellence.

347
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,333
And false humility.

348
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,917
My guess is that

349
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:28,583
Will finds you
pretty fascinating.

350
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,917
Candor seems to be
a trait he admires.

351
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:35,542
Honesty is the trait
he admires most.

352
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,917
And you should
honestly consider

353
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:42,125
why you're so competitive
with your own son.

354
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,083
Competitive?

355
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,041
Maybe in the past.

356
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,667
But I've come here
to help Will prepare

357
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:53,375
for his first task
as Captain.

358
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,291
Are you sure he'll accept
such a dangerous assignment?

359
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,000
He'll accept it just
because it is dangerous.

360
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,083
How can you be so sure?

361
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,917
Because I would.

362
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:05,208
And we aren't
so different,

363
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,625
Will and I.

364
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,166
(<i> door chimes</i> )

365
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,792
Come in.

366
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,917
Ah, you've seen
your mission briefing.

367
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,291
Yes, I have.
Any questions?

368
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,917
No, other than a question
about the<i> Aries'</i> first officer.

369
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,917
Oh, yes, his name
is Flaherty.

370
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,750
Yes. The briefing
mentioned something

371
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,583
about an uncanny
linguistic skill.

372
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,792
That is an understatement,
number one.

373
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:40,166
The last time
I saw Commander Flaherty,

374
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,750
he spoke 40 languages.

375
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,583
As I recall,
among the more exotic

376
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:49,959
were Romulan, Klingon,
Giamon, Stroyerian.

377
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,625
He speaks 40 languages?

378
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,208
He has this
unique ability

379
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,458
of instantaneously
interpreting and extrapolating

380
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,542
any verbal communication
that he hears.

381
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:01,875
You will find him very useful
in sector Vega-Omicron.

382
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,083
Yes, I'm sure I will.

383
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,250
(<i> door chime</i> )

384
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,333
Come in.

385
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,333
Oh, Captain Picard, at last.

386
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,208
I'd like to thank you for all
the help you've been to my son.

387
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,583
PICARD:
My only regret

388
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,125
is that your reunion
marks Will's farewell.

389
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,208
But he's ready
for this command.

390
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,625
Oh, yes.
I have no doubt.

391
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,792
Uh, Captain, may I have
a word with my son?

392
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:25,875
Yes, of course.

393
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,333
Excuse me, gentlemen.

394
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,500
I won't be pushed
into this decision.

395
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh, come on, Will.

396
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,041
Don't you think you're
ready for the<i> Aries?</i>

397
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,792
Starfleet does.

398
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:43,792
Of course, because you're
the best candidate for the job.

399
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,875
I only want you to know
I'm here if you need me.

400
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,917
I've been on my own
since I was 15.

401
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,625
I can take care of myself.

402
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,792
Please, spare me
the pain of your childhood.

403
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:57,250
I hung in for 13 years.

404
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,667
If that wasn't enough,
it's just too bad.

405
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,667
Data, what if I
missed something?

406
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,208
The ship's computer would've
corrected immediately.

407
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,041
Yeah, but maybe my inputs
were incorrect...

408
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,875
Data, Geordi...

409
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,375
I figured out Worf's problem.

410
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,959
You spoke to him?
No, no.

411
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,709
I accessed the complete
Klingon cultural database.

412
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:24,667
It took me some time...

413
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:27,125
Okay, Wesley.
Slow down.

414
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,875
What<i> is</i> the problem?

415
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,625
It's the tenth anniversary
of Worf's age of ascension.

416
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,417
His what?

417
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:36,375
The Klingon
age of ascension--

418
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,000
It's a ritual of great
significance.

419
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,583
A rite of initiation

420
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,834
marking the new level
of Klingon spiritual attainment.

421
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:45,208
And what is the significance of
the anniversary of this event?

422
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,125
It's a day
of celebration and ritual

423
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,709
spent with one's fellow
Klingons.

424
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,083
Worf doesn't have
any Klingon friends.

425
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,625
We're his friends.

426
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,041
Right, but we don't
practice

427
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,542
Klingon tradition,
and we're not Klingons.

428
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,709
Worf is feeling culturally
and socially isolated.

429
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,917
So what are
you suggesting?

430
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:03,375
I mean, I'm not sure
I want to invite

431
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,959
a bunch of Klingons
on board.

432
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,709
We can program the ship's
computer to supply

433
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:08,625
simulations on the holodeck.

434
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,417
Holographic Klingons.

435
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:11,875
Sure. Why not?

436
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,291
We need only
to program the computer

437
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,542
with details
of the specific ceremony.

438
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:17,125
No, the cultural
database said

439
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,041
that the Klingon's family
must attend.

440
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,041
So, we're his family.

441
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,750
We'll go.

442
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,625
I just wonder what kind of party
the Klingons had in mind.

443
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,875
Have you got a minute?

444
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,583
Sure.

445
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,250
I wanted to apologize for
my remark in ten-forward.

446
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,458
Your personal life is
none of my business.

447
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:42,250
Even if it involves
your father?

448
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,250
Even if it
involves my father.

449
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,291
Did he ever tell you
why he never remarried?

450
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,542
What woman would have him
with an ego like that?

451
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,125
I would have.
In a cold minute.

452
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,500
12 years ago, Kyle Riker
was a civilian strategist

453
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,208
advising Starfleet in its
conflict with the Tholians.

454
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,583
The Starbase that
he was operating from

455
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,041
was attacked.

456
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,291
None of the base crew
was expected to live.

457
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,083
And they all died.

458
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,125
All except your father.

459
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:29,709
Your father alone had
the will to endure,

460
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:32,208
to face the pain, to live.

461
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,917
I never knew
any of that about him.

462
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,750
I've never seen a man

463
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,125
fight so hard in all my life.

464
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,917
And you fell in love?

465
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:47,417
Yes, and so did he.

466
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,750
But marriage was
out of the question.

467
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,417
He had other priorities.

468
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:54,917
His career.

469
00:24:56,667 --> 00:25:00,583
You know, if I were you,
going out on the<i> Aries,</i>

470
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,625
I'd jettison
the emotional baggage

471
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,250
you're still
carrying around.

472
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,458
Now, the Klingon
cultural database

473
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:17,959
was very specific
on the setting.

474
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,458
Now let me guess.

475
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,000
20-piece orchestra,
magnificent ballroom,

476
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,208
everyone in formal wear.

477
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,709
No, there was
some unusual test

478
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:26,625
of inner strength involved.

479
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,291
That would entail the use
of Klingon "painstiks."

480
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,291
Painstiks?
Sounds lovely.

481
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:33,125
Enduring
physical suffering is

482
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,333
considered a Klingon
spiritual test.

483
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,625
You mean, in order for Worf
to celebrate the anniversary

484
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,041
of this ascension,
he has to be hurt?

485
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,291
And we have
to witness this?

486
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,208
We are his family.

487
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:52,709
(<i> door chime</i> )
Come.

488
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:58,500
Number one.

489
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,166
I'd be a fool to turn
that promotion down, wouldn't I?

490
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,375
I don't know.

491
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:06,667
And if you're asking me
what I think you should do,

492
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,500
I don't know that, either.

493
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,709
I can spell out for you,
albeit crudely,

494
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:16,417
what you're
choosing between.

495
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:18,375
As the first officer
of the<i> Enterprise,</i>

496
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:21,834
you have a position
of distinction, prestige,

497
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:24,542
even glamour of a sort.

498
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,458
You are the second in command

499
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,709
of Starfleet's flagship.

500
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:32,083
But still second in command.

501
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,583
Your promotion
will transfer you

502
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:39,917
to a relatively
insignificant ship

503
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:41,667
in an obscure corner

504
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,333
of the galaxy.

505
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,500
But it will be your ship.

506
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,000
And, being who you are,

507
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,166
it will soon be vibrant
with your authority,

508
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:56,792
your style, your vision.

509
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,875
You know...

510
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:06,458
there really is no substitute
for holding the reins.

511
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:16,041
I'll need a little more time
to make this decision.

512
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,458
Find anything yet?

513
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:34,667
Not yet.

514
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,834
There is
nothing to find.

515
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:39,166
No harm in checking,
I guess.

516
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,750
Really? How would you
like them to give

517
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,917
the transporter operation
a little once-over?

518
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,208
No problem.

519
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,458
We're totally shipshape.

520
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,333
You're missing the point.

521
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,417
It's just the idea that they
even suspect a malfunction.

522
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:54,709
If I were not a consummate
professional and an android,

523
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:58,250
I would find this entire
procedure insulting.

524
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,250
Thanks, Data.

525
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,667
Chief, would you be able
to attend a little party

526
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,583
for Lieutenant Worf
at 1700 hours?

527
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:12,333
A party for Worf?

528
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,542
Sounds intriguing, yeah.
I'd be delighted.

529
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:15,542
It's a surprise.

530
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:17,834
Oh, my lips are sealed.

531
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,917
I didn't want to leave
without saying good-bye.

532
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:26,291
I don't like good-byes.

533
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:28,959
How about
"until next time"?

534
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,542
How about
until next time.

535
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,709
It's been a pleasure
working with you, Commander.

536
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,041
The feeling is mutual...

537
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,917
Counselor.

538
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm supposed to know
how everyone feels,

539
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,041
but I can't read you
right now.

540
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:48,792
Perhaps your own feelings
are getting in the way.

541
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:52,291
My job is to help others
sort out their emotions.

542
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:55,333
My own feelings are
beside the point.

543
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,417
Not to me.

544
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,834
Our feelings are
what make us all human.

545
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,667
Are you feeling sad?

546
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,792
Yes, I am.

547
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:16,375
So am I.

548
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,458
I'm leaving at 2100 hours.

549
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:41,792
Can I have a minute?

550
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,208
I've practiced
my best Academy courtesy.

551
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,667
Now it's time
for you to go.

552
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,583
It's time for us
to have a talk.

553
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,959
So lower your shields.

554
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,125
I'm asking you to leave,
or I'll...

555
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,750
Or you'll what?

556
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,333
You know, it's a shame there's
no anbo-jyutsu ring nearby.

557
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,417
Really? There is.

558
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:05,166
Deck 12, the gymnasium.

559
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,792
We could clear the air
once and for all.

560
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,667
You're on.

561
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,625
Ah, scuttlebutt says
you wanted to see me.

562
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,041
That's right.

563
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,625
I thought
I knew you, Kyle.

564
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,542
You do,
as well as anyone.

565
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:33,375
Then what is this I hear about
an anbo-jyutsu match with Will?

566
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,125
You've heard.

567
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,542
Haven't we grown

568
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:39,166
beyond the point where
we resolve our problems

569
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,041
with physical conflict?

570
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,458
I think you're
overreacting.

571
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:44,166
<i>I'm</i> overreacting?

572
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,083
You're the one that's coming out
to fight with his own son.

573
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,542
Don't think of it
as a fight, Kate.

574
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:49,750
Think of it as more
of a contest.

575
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,375
And suppose
one of you is injured?

576
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,500
I know where to find
a good doctor.

577
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,917
Kate, look...
Kyle.

578
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:58,834
Will and I have been
playing anbo-jyutsu

579
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:00,125
ever since he was
eight years old,

580
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,291
and he knows how
to take care of himself...

581
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,750
and so do I.

582
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,041
Don't take this personally.

583
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:07,667
But Will is in his prime...

584
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,083
And I'm no spring chicken.

585
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,625
I know.
Don't worry.

586
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:14,125
He's never been
able to beat me.

587
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:39,750
Computer, is this it?

588
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,291
COMPUTER:
Correct.

589
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,500
Klingon rite
of ascension chamber.

590
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,125
Is this really
necessary?

591
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:49,583
If we want to get Worf
through his problem, it is.

592
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:52,458
Computer, please give us
Klingon personnel

593
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,667
appropriate to this event.

594
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,125
These images have been

595
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:02,041
specifically programmed
for ascension rites.

596
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,250
Cute bunch.

597
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,333
And they use those?

598
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,917
Those are
Klingon painstiks.

599
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,000
I once saw
one of them used

600
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,917
against a two-ton
Rectyne monopod.

601
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:21,875
Poor creature jumped five meters
at the slightest touch.

602
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:24,959
Finally died from excessive
cephalic pressures.

603
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:27,709
You mean...

604
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:29,250
That's right.

605
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,750
The animal's head
exploded like...

606
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,000
I think that's enough,
Chief O'Brien.

607
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,834
I do not enjoy riddles,
counselor.

608
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:44,792
You will enjoy this one.

609
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:47,375
I'm in no mood
for trifling or games.

610
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,750
Not today.

611
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,458
I know what an important day
this is for you.

612
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:54,166
The anniversary
of your rite of ascension.

613
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,875
You know about that?

614
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:58,041
All your friends
on board do.

615
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:00,000
That is impossible.

616
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,041
It is a secret known
only to Klingons.

617
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:06,083
And certain resourceful
young ensigns.

618
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:11,375
Wesley Crusher.

619
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,417
What does he know
about it?

620
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,083
Just bear with me.

621
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,875
Where are we going?

622
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,458
The holodeck.

623
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,625
This is truly trying
my patience, Counselor.

624
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:27,125
I think you
will approve.

625
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,375
You're not coming in?

626
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,542
No.

627
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:39,166
Open.

628
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,750
An ascension ceremony.

629
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,166
GEORDI:
Happy anniversary, Worf.

630
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,208
Shall we begin?

631
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,875
I am ready.

632
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:24,500
(<i> speaking Klingon</i> )

633
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:38,333
Today...
I am a warrior.

634
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,250
I must show you my heart!

635
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,750
I travel
the river of blood!

636
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,875
(<i> screaming</i> )

637
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,125
The true test
of Klingon strength

638
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:58,959
is to admit one's
most profound feelings

639
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,875
while under
extreme duress.

640
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:04,875
(<i> heavy breathing</i> )

641
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:08,333
(<i> speaking in Klingon</i> )

642
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,542
(<i> screaming</i> )

643
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,834
The battle is mine.

644
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:22,917
I crave only the blood
of the enemy.

645
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:25,083
(<i> speaking in Klingon</i> )

646
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:28,667
(<i> screaming</i> )

647
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:38,917
The bile of the vanquished
flows over my hands.

648
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:42,625
(<i> speaking in Klingon</i> )

649
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:47,083
(<i> screaming</i> )

650
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,375
Thank you.

651
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,375
Is Lieutenant Worf
all right?

652
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,750
He's never been happier.

653
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,709
So it was a good ceremony?

654
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:34,583
Well, let's just say
that I was not about

655
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:37,041
to stay around
for refreshments.

656
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,250
Klingon culture is
not in your taste?

657
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,458
I'm just glad

658
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:41,750
that humans have progressed

659
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,500
beyond the need
for barbaric display.

660
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,208
Have they?

661
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,291
Commander Riker
and his father

662
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,834
are in the gymnasium,

663
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,542
about to engage
in a barbarism of their own.

664
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:55,583
Don't remind me, it's something
of which I do not approve.

665
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,458
In spite of human evolution,

666
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:00,625
there are still some traits
that are endemic to gender.

667
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,959
You think that they're going
to knock each other's brains out

668
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,333
because they're men?

669
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:06,125
Human males are unique.

670
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,625
Fathers continue to regard
their sons as children

671
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,375
even into adulthood.

672
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,625
And sons continue to chafe
against what they perceive

673
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,959
as their fathers'
expectations of them.

674
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:19,750
It's almost as if they never
really grow up at all, isn't it?

675
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:24,583
Perhaps that's part
of their charm...

676
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:27,583
and why we find them
so attractive.

677
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:30,834
Particularly men
like Commander Riker.

678
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,333
And his father.

679
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,959
I hope they don't
injure each other.

680
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:49,875
Anbo-jyutsu, the ultimate
evolution in the martial arts.

681
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,208
I remember
my early lessons.

682
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,709
You could never get used
to the sightless factor...

683
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:56,375
or to losing.

684
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,667
True.

685
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:00,250
But I've had
15 years to practice.

686
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,959
Well, let's see
if you've learned anything.

687
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:12,417
(<i> ceremonial chant</i>
<i>in Japanese</i> )

688
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:53,750
Uhh!

689
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,458
Well...

690
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,041
You've been practicing.

691
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,417
And remembering.

692
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:11,166
You should have been
the one to die, not her.

693
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:14,792
(<i> repeats ceremonial chant</i> )

694
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:18,125
Good, get it all out.

695
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:21,041
(<i> ceremonial chant</i> )

696
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:41,083
Agh!

697
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,125
<i>Matta!</i>

698
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,709
I had you.

699
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:48,291
Listen, Will.

700
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:50,959
You were too young
to understand.

701
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:53,375
And I was
too hurt to explain.

702
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:55,917
You were never
too hurt for anything.

703
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:57,375
She was your mother.

704
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,375
But she was my wife.

705
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:00,792
And when she died,

706
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:03,667
all that kept me
going was you.

707
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,333
You had a strange way
of showing it.

708
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,458
I came here thinking

709
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:08,959
we could talk this out.

710
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,542
But maybe you're right.

711
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,125
Maybe I am no father.

712
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:13,792
And you're no son.

713
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:16,875
And this fight is
all we have left.

714
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:25,792
(<i> both grunting</i> )

715
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,333
<i>Matta!</i>

716
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,333
What is it now?

717
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:49,750
You can't do that.

718
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,250
What?

719
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,542
<i>Hachidan kiritsu.</i> 
It's illegal.

720
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,250
You're kidding.

721
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,834
All these years...

722
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:02,291
that's why I never won.
You were cheating.

723
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:04,417
(<i> chuckling</i> )

724
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,542
It worked, didn't it?

725
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:09,250
Kept you coming
back for more.

726
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,083
Incredible.

727
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:13,709
You cheated me.
How did you get away with it?

728
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:15,208
You were just a kid.

729
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:16,500
By the time
you were 12 years old,

730
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,583
I knew I couldn't take you.

731
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:18,959
But I had to keep you
interested.

732
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,625
I had to keep you
challenged, didn't I?

733
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,625
I always
hated you for that.

734
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:23,959
Damn it, Will!

735
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:26,542
You were barely out of diapers
when she died.

736
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:28,583
You hardly knew her!

737
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,917
I loved her.

738
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,792
Of course you carried
the pain, so did I.

739
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,166
I should have explained this
to you a long time ago,

740
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,583
but it hurt too much.

741
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,208
Then the wall grew up
between us.

742
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,166
Living there,
you and me,

743
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,000
the wall got bigger.

744
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,291
You know...

745
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:51,208
it's funny.

746
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,834
I can talk to a whole
roomful of admirals

747
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:59,250
about anything
in the galaxy,

748
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,875
but I can't talk to you
about how I feel.

749
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:07,166
How do you feel?

750
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:11,125
How do you think?

751
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:15,333
I love you, son.

752
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,792
I've got to get back
to the Starbase.

753
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,041
I know.

754
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,458
I'm glad you came.

755
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,083
Be careful now, okay?

756
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,208
Starbase Montgomery's
briefing specialist

757
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:49,583
and analytical team
have beamed down, sir.

758
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:53,208
Ah, what were the analytical
team's findings?

759
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:55,041
They suggested
we reprogram the system

760
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:58,125
to correct
the readout variables.

761
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:01,667
Precisely what Commander Data
recommended, as I recall.

762
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:06,834
At least it gave
Commander Riker

763
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,375
the opportunity to consider
his promotion.

764
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:12,458
Now that he's accepted,

765
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:15,375
we can leave him
at Starbase<i> Montgomery.</i>

766
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:21,125
Number one?

767
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,083
Captain...

768
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,208
with your permission,

769
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:27,583
I've decided to stay
on board the<i> Enterprise.</i>

770
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:35,583
Granted.

771
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,542
Thank you, sir.

772
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,750
Take us out of orbit,
Ensign Crusher.

773
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,542
Breaking synchronous
orbit, sir.

774
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:46,750
Set course for Beta Kupsic.

775
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,041
That is still
our destination?

776
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:49,166
Mm-hmm.

777
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:51,542
Velocity, warp factor 5.

778
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:55,125
Course and speed set, sir.

779
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:59,834
Any particular reason
for this change of heart?

780
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:02,250
Motivated self-interest.

781
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,083
Right now, the best place
for me to be is here.

782
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:10,083
Engage.
