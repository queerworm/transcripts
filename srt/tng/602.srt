00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:07,375
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46041.1:</i>

2
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:09,667
<i>We have located</i>
<i>the USS</i> Yosemite,

3
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:12,625
<i>a Starfleet science vessel</i>
<i>sent to the Igo sector</i>

4
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,583
<i>to observe</i>
<i>a remote plasma streamer.</i>

5
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:17,792
<i>The ship has not been</i>
<i>heard from in several days.</i>

6
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:19,583
Magnify.

7
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,250
The last report we have
says they were observing

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,041
the streamer
at medium range.

9
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,959
Maybe they went in
for a closer look...

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,625
got more than
they bargained for.

11
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:33,125
Hail them.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,792
No response.

13
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,000
Life signs?

14
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,083
Our scanners
cannot penetrate

15
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,375
the plasma streamer's
distortion field.

16
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:41,792
Can we tractor them out?

17
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,625
No, sir, ionic interference
is too heavy.

18
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,458
I'll take a shuttle in.

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,667
Too risky.

20
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:50,375
You could be
pulled in, too.

21
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,125
Bridge to Engineering.

22
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,709
Mr. La Forge, can we beam an
away team onto the science ship?

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,291
We can beam them
over there, Captain,

24
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,792
but with all this
interference,

25
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,125
we might not get a positive
lock to bring them back.

26
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,959
Commander, if we bridged our
transporter system with theirs,

27
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,000
we might be able to
cut through the ionic field.

28
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,583
That's a good idea, Barclay.

29
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,208
Captain,
I think we can do it.

30
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,458
We're going to bridge
the two transporter systems.

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,333
PICARD: Acknowledged.
Meet Commander Riker in
Transporter Room three.

32
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,750
Aye, sir.

33
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,250
Barclay, I'm going to need
a systems engineer

34
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,375
on this away team.

35
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,375
I'll... I'll ask
Ensign Dern to join you.

36
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,625
I meant you, Barclay.

37
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,291
Shouldn't I stay here

38
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,041
and set up the remote link?

39
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,333
Dern can do that.
Come on, let's go.

40
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,875
Status, Mr. O'Brien?

41
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:47,709
I'll have to send you over
one at a time, Commander,

42
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,750
because of
bandwidth limitations.

43
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:52,166
And the transport cycle
will take a bit longer.

44
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,750
RIKER: How much longer?
O'BRIEN: Four or five seconds--

45
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,291
about twice
the normal time.

46
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,417
I'm afraid you're in
for a bumpy ride, Commander.

47
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,166
What do you...

48
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,500
What exactly do you mean
by "a bumpy ride"?

49
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,041
Well, there may be
a small amount

50
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,834
of static charge
accumulation.

51
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,125
You'll feel a bit
of tingling.

52
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,458
It's nothing
to worry about.

53
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,667
Let's do it.
Mr. Worf.

54
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,625
O'BRIEN:
Engaging system interlock.

55
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:25,500
Pattern buffers
synchronized.

56
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:28,166
Phase transition coils
at standby.

57
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,083
Energizing.

58
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,959
He's there.

59
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,959
I'll go next.

60
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,166
O'BRIEN:
Engaging interlock.

61
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,375
Buffers synched.
Energizing.

62
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,625
I'm ready.

63
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,792
O'BRIEN:
Engaging interlock.

64
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,542
Buffers in sync.

65
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,917
Oh, wait a minute.

66
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,458
I'm reading an ionic fluctuation
in the matter stream.

67
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,750
Oh. No problem.

68
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:19,041
Okay. Energizing.

69
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,000
(<i> breathing slowly</i>
<i>and heavily</i> )

70
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:32,542
Reg, you're up.

71
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,834
Reg?

72
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,166
Aye, sir.

73
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,875
O'BRIEN:
Engaging interlock.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,166
Buffers in sync.

75
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,583
Phase coils...
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,917
I just can't do this.

77
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:38,542
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

78
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:43,125
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

79
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,834
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

80
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,417
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

81
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:52,917
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

82
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,709
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

83
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:02,750
Reg, you were faced
with a difficult transport.

84
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,500
Anyone would have been
apprehensive in that situation.

85
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,500
You tell that
to Commander La Forge

86
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,125
and the rest of
the away team.

87
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,333
I'm sure
they understand.

88
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,959
As soon as you
feel up to it,

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,625
you can probably
still join them.

90
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,583
No!

91
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,792
Reg, is there something
you're not telling me?

92
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,208
Actually...

93
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:30,250
it's, this is not the...

94
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,125
this is not the first time
I've been apprehensive.

95
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:37,291
Every single time
that I tried to do it,

96
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,542
I had this certain feeling,

97
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,583
and I guess...
you could call it...

98
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,834
mortal terror.

99
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,583
Why have you kept it a secret?

100
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,500
Why?!

101
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:54,709
Because my career in Starfleet
would be over, that's why.

102
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,291
I doubt that.

103
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,417
I've always managed
to avoid it somehow.

104
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,166
You wouldn't believe
how many hours

105
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,875
that I've logged in
shuttlecraft.

106
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:07,333
I mean, the idea
of being deconstructed

107
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,125
molecule by molecule--
it's more than I can stand.

108
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,875
Even when I was a child,

109
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,709
I always had a dreadful fear

110
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,333
that if ever
I was dematerialized,

111
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,041
that I would...

112
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,875
never come back again whole.

113
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:26,417
I know it sounds crazy, but...

114
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,125
It's not crazy at all.

115
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,542
You<i> are</i> being taken apart

116
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,917
molecule by molecule.

117
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,709
Reg, you're not
the first person

118
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,375
to have anxiety
about transporting.

119
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:45,792
We can desensitize you
to this type of fear.

120
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:49,750
It's a slow and gradual
process, but it works.

121
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:52,250
It does? How?

122
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,125
Well,
you might first try

123
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,250
a relaxation technique,
like plexing.

124
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,375
Plexing?

125
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,375
Yes, it's
a Betazoid method.

126
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:04,375
The next time you feel
nervous about transporting,

127
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,667
you stimulate a neural
pressure point, like this.

128
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,917
There's a nerve cluster
just behind the carotid artery.

129
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,417
It stimulates
the part of the brain

130
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,500
that releases
natural endorphins.

131
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:19,291
Plexing...
sounds easy enough.

132
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,917
Here. There.

133
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,875
Hmm.

134
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,583
You know, I... I...

135
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,834
I feel better already.
I think I can do this.

136
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,500
There's no need to rush.
No, no, no.

137
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,291
We talked about
confronting my fears.

138
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,709
"The best way out is through."
You said that once, remember?

139
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,500
I suppose I did.

140
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:48,291
I'm going to beam over there.
I can do it.

141
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,166
There's no sign
of any survivors.

142
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,625
No sign of<i> anyone.</i>

143
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,333
Maybe they abandoned ship.

144
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,875
WORF:
Unlikely.

145
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:17,417
The escape pods
are still on board.

146
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,458
There was an explosion here.
That much we do know.

147
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,750
Any idea what caused it?

148
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,250
I ruled out
a reactor core failure

149
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,875
and there's no sign
of a systems overload.

150
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:27,500
Blast analysis indicates
the explosion originated here,

151
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,875
in the center
of the transport chamber.

152
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,250
How is that possible?

153
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,709
The transporter
is still functional.

154
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,417
Could they have
beamed aboard

155
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,542
an explosive device?

156
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,375
Commander Riker?
Could you come here, please?

157
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:41,041
Excuse me.

158
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:56,000
Lieutenant Joshua Kelly.
He was the ship's engineer.

159
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,667
How did he die?

160
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:00,041
He has second- and third-degree
burns over most of his body,

161
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,250
but I don't think they were
the cause of his death.

162
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,166
I'd like to take him back
to do an autopsy.

163
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,667
You're sure
about this, sir?

164
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,291
Sure.
Please proceed.

165
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,959
It'll only take a minute.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,917
Oh, it should be
a smooth ride over.

167
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,875
Good. Good.

168
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,375
I know how you feel
about this, sir.

169
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,500
You're... you're afraid
of transporting, too?

170
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:39,917
No. Arachnids.

171
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,417
Sickening, crawly little
things, don't you think?

172
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,834
All those legs...

173
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,625
Spiders...
they've never bothered me.

174
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,000
A few years back,
I was called in

175
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,166
to reroute an emitter array
at a starbase at Zayra IV.

176
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,250
Turns out the entire system
was infested

177
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,542
with Talarian hook spiders.

178
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,125
You ever seen
a Talarian hook spider?

179
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,500
Their legs
are half a meter long.

180
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,709
Well, I had a choice.

181
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,250
Do I walk away and let
the emitter blow itself to hell

182
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,875
or do I crawl in the Jefferies
tube with 20 hook spiders?

183
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,417
Wh... what happened?

184
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,000
It was the hardest thing
I ever did,

185
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,709
but I got through it.

186
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,333
After that, I was never
quite so afraid of spiders.

187
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:32,458
Thanks.

188
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,375
Energizing.

189
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:23,166
Reg.
Welcome aboard.

190
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,625
You ready to work?
Yes, sir.

191
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:26,834
Good.

192
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,291
Why don't you start
by downloading

193
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,792
the ship's science logs
over there.
Aye, sir.

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,625
Still four members of
the crew unaccounted for.

195
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,125
Did you come up
with anything?

196
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,166
Well, I don't know
how these fit in,

197
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,458
but I found them all around
the transporter platform.
What are they?

198
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,125
They look like pieces of
a standard sample container.

199
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,458
We'll take these back to
the ship and analyze them there.

200
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,166
Mr. Barclay?

201
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,250
Glad you could join us.

202
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,375
Me, too, sir.

203
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:08,625
The Ferengi are claiming
two of their freighters

204
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,709
were destroyed by a Cardassian
warship in your sector.

205
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,834
Is there any evidence
to support this?

206
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,500
Although I'm loath to believe
the Ferengi about anything,

207
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:20,375
there was evidence
of Cardassian weapons.

208
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,667
If the Cardassians
also attacked the<i> Yosemite,</i>

209
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:26,959
it could indicate a large-scale
movement in this sector.

210
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,709
I have an away team
on board the ship.

211
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,542
The initial report indicates
there was an explosion on board,

212
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,709
but we're not sure
if it was from an attack.

213
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,542
How soon until you know?
A few hours.

214
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,959
If it looks like Cardassians,
I'll contact you immediately.

215
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,417
Very well.

216
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,834
DATA:
Bridge to Captain Picard.
Go ahead, Mr. Data.

217
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:52,458
The away team is returning
to the<i> Enterprise,</i> sir.
Acknowledged.

218
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,959
Have Commander Riker
come to my Ready Room
as soon as he's on board.

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,417
Aye, sir.

220
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,625
La Forge to
Transporter Room three.

221
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,583
I'm ready to go.
Stand by, Commander.

222
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,417
Barclay to<i> Enterprise.</i>

223
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,291
One to beam back.

224
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,458
O'BRIEN:
Stand by, sir.

225
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:54,542
See, sir?
That wasn't so bad, was it?

226
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,291
Mission logs, science logs,
medical logs--

227
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,959
they're all scrambled.

228
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,083
Looks like the blast wiped out
the ship's core memory.

229
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,917
We could try
to reconstitute

230
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,000
the data stream.

231
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,125
It's worth a try.

232
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,583
Commander,
has anything strange

233
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,417
ever happened to you
during transport?

234
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,083
Like what?

235
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,583
I don't know.

236
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,000
Anything out of
the ordinary?

237
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,834
No, not really.

238
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,458
This looks hopeless.

239
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,792
We're not going to get
anything out of these logs.

240
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:45,667
You know, maybe...

241
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,500
this broken sample container
I found can tell us something.

242
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:51,166
Let's try to get this thing
back into one piece.

243
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,834
I mean... have...

244
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,834
ha-have you ever
seen anything?

245
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,875
Where?

246
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,000
In the...
during transport.

247
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,125
Sometimes my visor
picks up resonance patterns

248
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,458
from matter-energy
conversion.

249
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,834
It's actually
kind of pretty.

250
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,458
Why?

251
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,583
I'm just wondering.

252
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,041
Reg, what are you getting at?

253
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,208
Did you see something
during transport?

254
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,041
When I was returning
to the<i> Enterprise,</i>

255
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,375
I could have sworn I saw
something in the matter stream.

256
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,166
Something?

257
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,000
There was phased matter
all around

258
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,583
and, at first,
I thought it was some kind of,

259
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,083
uh, energy discharge,

260
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:49,125
but then, it flew toward me
and touched my arm.

261
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,750
How could something
be in there?

262
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:54,166
Molecules flying apart
half-phased--

263
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,625
I mean...
it's impossible, isn't it?

264
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,959
Well, we'd better
check it out.

265
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,709
When we're done here,

266
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,208
we'll run a full diagnostic
on the transporter, all right?

267
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,333
All right.

268
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,458
The confinement beam
subsystems check out,

269
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,333
so do the phase
transition coils.

270
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,500
The pattern buffer is fine.

271
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:20,375
Emitter pads,
targeting scanners...

272
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,375
they're all working fine.

273
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,917
This system's clean

274
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,750
and so is
the science vessel's.

275
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:29,125
Reg, there's a lot of energy
floating around in the beam.

276
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,667
Maybe you saw a surge
in the matter stream.

277
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:34,750
Yeah.

278
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,750
I'll run a scan on
the Heisenberg compensators.

279
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:39,041
Oh, no, Chief,
you've done enough already.

280
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,166
It's no problem.

281
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,291
Why don't you
give me a hand?

282
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,792
You know, maybe ignorance
really is bliss.

283
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,250
Sir?

284
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,875
Well, if I didn't know
so much about these things,

285
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:56,583
maybe they wouldn't
scare me so much.

286
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,542
I can still remember the day

287
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,959
in Dr. Olafson's
Transporter Theory class

288
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,709
when he was talking
about the body

289
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,917
being converted into billions
of kiloquads of data...

290
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,417
zipping through subspace,

291
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,250
and I realized
there's no margin for error.

292
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,333
One atom out of place and...
poof!

293
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,041
You never come back.

294
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,875
It's amazing people
aren't lost all the time.

295
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:20,542
With all due respect, sir,

296
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,500
I've been doing this
for 22 years

297
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,208
and I haven't lost
anybody yet.

298
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,792
Yes, but...

299
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:29,417
you realize if the imaging
scanners are off

300
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,834
even one-thousandth
of a percent...

301
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,834
That's why each pad
has four redundant scanners.

302
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,625
If any one scanner fails,
the other three take over.

303
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,917
Reg, how many
transporter accidents

304
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:43,083
have there been
in the last ten years?

305
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,875
Two? Three?

306
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,500
There are millions of people

307
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,250
who transport safely every day
without a problem.

308
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,959
I've heard of problems.

309
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,875
What about
transporter psychosis?

310
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,959
Transporter psychosis?!

311
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,792
There hasn't been a case of
that in over 50 years--

312
00:18:57,834 --> 00:19:01,083
not since they perfected
the multiplex pattern buffers.

313
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:05,375
Reg, transporting really is
the safest way to travel.

314
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

315
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,750
I'd like to take
a closer look at those burns.

316
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,500
Take a tissue sample, please.

317
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:19,291
Yes, Doctor.

318
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:36,125
Damage to the epidermis only.

319
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,542
Initiate a circulatory probe.

320
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,083
(<i> beeping</i> )

321
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,458
Dr. Crusher!

322
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,250
His heart's beating.

323
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,375
Cardio-stimulator.

324
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:03,959
Now.

325
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,458
OGAWA:
It's gone.

326
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,750
Neuro-electrical activity
in the cerebral cortex.

327
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,625
Nothing.

328
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:18,542
Now his respiratory
system's active.

329
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:27,041
What the hell is going on?

330
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,041
Here you are,
Lieutenant.

331
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:30,000
Water-- ten degrees Celsius.

332
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:54,291
Computer, access
Starfleet Medical Database

333
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,959
and tell me about, um...

334
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,208
describe the disorder

335
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,583
"transporter psychosis."

336
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,667
COMPUTER: Transporter psychosis
was diagnosed in the year 2209

337
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:08,834
by researchers
on Delinia II...

338
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,709
No, no, stop.

339
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,500
All I need is...

340
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,500
what causes it?

341
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,125
COMPUTER:
It is caused by a breakdown

342
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,834
of neurochemical molecules
during transport,

343
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,500
affecting the body's motor
functions, autonomic systems

344
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:25,250
and the brain's
higher reasoning centers.

345
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,083
What are the symptoms?

346
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,959
COMPUTER: Victims suffer
from paranoid delusions,

347
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,500
multi-infarct dementia,

348
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:34,291
hallucinations...

349
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,291
Hallucinations?

350
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,542
What... what kind of
hallucinations?

351
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,750
COMPUTER: Victims experience
somatic, tactile

352
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,000
and a visual hallucinations,

353
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,041
accompanied by
psychogenic hysteria.

354
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:52,125
Peripheral symptoms
include sleeplessness,

355
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,500
accelerated heart rate,

356
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:59,458
diminished eyesight
leading to acute myopia,

357
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,583
painful spasms
in the extremities

358
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,500
and in most cases,
dehydration.

359
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,333
Computer...

360
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,083
what is the treatment

361
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,667
for transporter psychosis?

362
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,875
COMPUTER:
There is no known treatment.

363
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,458
The autopsy showed
residual ionization

364
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,792
in every one of
Lieutenant Kelly's systems.

365
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,875
I think that's what caused
the muscular and systemic
contractions.

366
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,834
From where
did the ionization come?

367
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,333
There's evidence
of electrical burns

368
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,750
on the victim's body,

369
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:38,166
as if he was exposed
to ionized gas

370
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,709
or high-energy plasma.

371
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,166
Plasma?

372
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,792
There's no way they could
have been exposed...

373
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:46,333
Unless it was matter
from the streamer.

374
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,041
Is there evidence
of a hull breach?

375
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,542
Could the plasma
from the streamer

376
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,750
have found its way
onto the ship?

377
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,458
No.

378
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,417
Data, what's the report on
that broken sample container?

379
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,333
The analysis of the fragments
is not yet complete.

380
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:01,000
Captain,
if there's evidence

381
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,542
of similar ionization
in those fragments,

382
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,250
it could mean
that they tried

383
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,625
to beam aboard material
from the streamer.

384
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:10,291
If the plasma exploded,
that would explain a few things.

385
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,291
Let me know when
the analysis is complete.

386
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,500
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir.

387
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,542
LA FORGE:
From the look of these
fracture patterns,

388
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,208
I'd say that the explosive force
came from within the container.

389
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,959
The container does
show evidence

390
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,375
of residual
ionization.

391
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,792
I believe your
hypothesis was correct.

392
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,834
It was used to store
high-energy plasma.

393
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,959
LA FORGE:
So they<i> were</i> collecting samples
from the plasma streamer.

394
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,125
But they had
the proper container.

395
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,792
How could it have exploded?

396
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:49,166
Perhaps we should attempt
to re-create their experiment

397
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,834
to see what happens to matter
when it is beamed aboard
under similar conditions.

398
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,166
LA FORGE:
It's a good idea.
We'll prepare a new container.

399
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:57,250
Reg, I don't want
to take any chances here.

400
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,000
Start setting up a level-5
containment field

401
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,959
here in Engineering, okay?
Aye, sir.

402
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,667
Are you all right,
Lieutenant?

403
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:13,917
I'm fine.

404
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes, thank you.

405
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,500
Geordi?
Hmm?

406
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:36,875
Lieutenant Barclay appears
inordinately preoccupied

407
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:39,041
with his physiological
condition.

408
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,125
I have seen him
check his pulse rate,

409
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,291
as well as his visual
acuity several times

410
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,417
over the last 20 minutes.

411
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,709
Thanks, Data.

412
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,625
Reg?

413
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,291
Yes, sir?

414
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,583
You okay?

415
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:20,166
I'm just fine, sir.

416
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,125
You look a little pale.

417
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,166
I do?

418
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,709
Look, Reg, it's been
a long couple of days.

419
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,000
Why don't you
get some rest?

420
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,208
We've got everything
under control here.

421
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,083
I think I'll do that, sir.
Thank you.

422
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:46,959
La Forge to Counselor Troi.
Go ahead, Commander.

423
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,875
Counselor,
do you have a minute?

424
00:26:57,834 --> 00:27:00,875
Lieutenant Barclay,
I've been calling you.

425
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:02,875
Why haven't you responded?

426
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:04,500
Reg, what are you doing?
I'm walking.

427
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,458
I can see that.
Where are you going?
Nowhere!

428
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,792
I just don't get to see
these decks very often.

429
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,333
Look, there's
stellar cartography.

430
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,375
I thought that
was Deck 11.

431
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:14,625
Mr. Barclay...
I was having
trouble sleeping

432
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,333
and I'm trying
to wear myself out.

433
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:19,500
It is a perfectly normal thing
to be doing, isn't it?

434
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,291
Commander La Forge
said you seemed

435
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,792
a little nervous
this morning.

436
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:25,041
I'm always nervous.
Everybody knows that.

437
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,000
He also mentioned
that you said

438
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:29,667
you saw something
in the transporter beam.
Well, I was wrong.

439
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:30,875
They checked the transporter
and there wasn't...

440
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,083
I mean, there
was nothing there.

441
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,333
I imagined
the whole thing.

442
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,208
You don't sound
very convinced of that.

443
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,875
Listen, Counselor,

444
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:39,250
I really appreciate
your concern in this matter,

445
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,542
but I wish you wouldn't continue
with this conversation.

446
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,291
I'm really perfectly fine.

447
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:47,041
Mr. Barclay, you're exhausted
and highly agitated.

448
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,959
And I cannot allow
a member of this crew

449
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,083
to endanger himself
or others.

450
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:54,125
I'm not endangering anyone else
and I really wish you...

451
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,250
I think it would be
in your best interest

452
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:59,542
to take a leave of absence.

453
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:02,583
Reg, I'm temporarily
relieving you of duty.

454
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:08,500
Fine. Fine.

455
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:11,500
Do what you have to do,
Counselor.

456
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:23,417
(<i> sound of sea breeze</i>
<i>and birds chirping</i> )

457
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,250
Computer, more birds.

458
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,792
(<i> chirping becomes</i>
<i>overwhelming</i> )

459
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:40,458
End stress reduction program.

460
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,208
Water.
COMPUTER: Specify temperature.

461
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,125
I don't care.
Just give me water.

462
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,792
Calm. Calm. Stay calm.

463
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,166
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

464
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:28,083
All right, Computer,
let's try some music.

465
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,625
Something soothing.

466
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,375
(<i> soft, tranquil</i>
<i>music begins</i> )

467
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:36,375
(<i> breathing deeply</i> )

468
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,375
(<i> gasping</i> )

469
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:18,625
(<i> door opening</i> )

470
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:20,500
Sir, begging your pardon,

471
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:23,375
but couldn't this wait
till the morning?
No.

472
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:26,542
Chief, I've just... I've been
reviewing the transport logs.

473
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:30,125
What are these... these energy
variations that keep appearing?

474
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:32,834
There was one when
I was transported to
the science ship, do you see?

475
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,709
Yeah, they're just, uh...

476
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,625
Sorry. They're just
ionic fluctuations--

477
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,083
a result
of our interlock

478
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:40,417
with the<i> Yosemite's</i> 
transporter system.

479
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,458
So a fluctuation occurred

480
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,500
while I was inside
the matter stream.

481
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,583
It's nothing
to worry about, sir.

482
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,750
I need you
to transport me

483
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:52,500
to the science ship
and then directly back again.

484
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:54,625
And while
I'm in the beam,

485
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:58,375
can you re-create one of
those ionic fluctuations?

486
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:01,458
I guess so, but if you don't
mind my asking, sir, what for?

487
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,792
Well, I...
Commander La Forge

488
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:06,500
wants some tricorder readings
on those fluctuations.

489
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,291
We can do that
from right here.

490
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,375
No, I... the transporter sensors
may not be sensitive enough.

491
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:15,709
Now, I'm giving you an order,
Mr. O'Brien.

492
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,834
Aye, sir.

493
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:23,417
If you don't mind my making
an observation, sir,

494
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,625
you forgot to bring
a tricorder.

495
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,917
Either there's
something in there

496
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,417
or I'm going crazy,

497
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,166
and I've just got to know.

498
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:38,041
You can understand that,
can't you?

499
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,041
Yes, sir, I can.

500
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,458
Stand by, sir.

501
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,709
I want you to wake
the senior staff.

502
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:24,125
...and, and then I saw it
again just 20 minutes ago.

503
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,291
It was the same exact thing,

504
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,667
just moving around
in the transporter beam.

505
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:29,959
Let me get this straight.

506
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,458
You think this
thing was alive?

507
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,917
It... it... it was...

508
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,583
dark and distorted

509
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:39,125
and it had what looked
like a mouth.

510
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,542
A mouth...

511
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:44,667
I don't see anything
wrong with his arm.

512
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:48,250
Reg, why did you wait so long
to tell anybody about your arm?

513
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,208
Well... I...

514
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,333
I thought
I was hallucinating.

515
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,250
That I... had, um...

516
00:32:57,291 --> 00:33:00,250
That it was
transporter psychosis,

517
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,834
but now I know what I saw
in there was real.

518
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,750
I was the only one
who experienced

519
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,041
ionic fluctuations
in the transport.

520
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,583
Maybe that's why
no one else saw it.

521
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:14,166
Mr. Barclay, I've been told
that you've been under

522
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:17,542
considerable strain
during the past few days.

523
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:21,583
Isn't it possible
that you simply imagined...

524
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,500
I know what you're going
to say, Captain.

525
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:25,375
I know I've been acting
strange lately,

526
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,041
but you've got to
believe me

527
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,166
that I would never
have called you in here

528
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,542
unless I was
absolutely certain.

529
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:38,709
Mr. La Forge,
get Mr. O'Brien.

530
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,291
Take that transporter
system apart

531
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,625
piece by piece
if you have to.

532
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,792
Mr. Worf, I want
a level-3 security alert

533
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:48,125
until further notice.
Aye, sir.

534
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:51,834
I'll run a micro-cellular scan
of Mr. Barclay's arm.

535
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:54,959
It might take some time, but if
there's a problem, I'll find it.

536
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,875
Keep me apprised.
Dismissed.

537
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm picking up minute levels
of residual ionization

538
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,542
from the subdermal tissue
of his left arm.

539
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,667
The patterns
correspond exactly

540
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:21,250
to those we measured
in Lieutenant Kelly's body

541
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:24,250
and in the sample container
from the science ship.

542
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:26,750
There's no question--
you have been exposed

543
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:29,208
to the same high energy
plasma they were.

544
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,250
So something did happen to me
in the transporter beam.

545
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:35,041
You might have been exposed to
something from the science ship.

546
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:38,417
You did say something touched
your left arm during transport.

547
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:41,208
And that's exactly where
the ionization is focused.

548
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,542
Does this ionization pose
a threat to Mr. Barclay?

549
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,041
It might.

550
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,041
I'll have to run a base-pair
correlation to see

551
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:49,208
if there's any sign
of DNA breakdown.

552
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,208
Sir, Commander
La Forge and I

553
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,083
were planning to re-create
the circumstances

554
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,792
of the explosion
on the<i> Yosemite.</i>

555
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:57,417
And that might
give us some answers.

556
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:59,542
Permission to continue
with the experiment?

557
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:01,250
Granted.

558
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:04,083
Tell Mr. O'Brien to take all the
primary transporters off-line.

559
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:07,709
I don't want to risk
any further contaminations.

560
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,000
Make sure you take all the
necessary safety precautions.

561
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,000
Aye, sir.

562
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,917
I'd like you to wear
this monitoring device.

563
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:17,709
It will tell me if there is
the slightest sign

564
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,500
of increased ionization.

565
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:21,500
Yes, Doctor.

566
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:31,458
Structural reinforcement
is at 240%.

567
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,917
Activating
containment field.

568
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:39,250
Well, that should do it.

569
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:40,834
Okay, Reg,
we've locked on

570
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,333
to the coordinates
of the plasma streamer.

571
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,083
Go ahead and beam aboard
a sample, will you?

572
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,834
Aye, sir.

573
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:03,208
Okay.

574
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,959
What would they
have done first?

575
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Standard analysis begins with
a resonance frequency scan.

576
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,500
That sounds like a good place
to start. Let's do that.

577
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,166
Initiating
resonance sweep.

578
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:17,166
Frequency
range at...

579
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:22,500
Barclay, check
the containment field.

580
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,333
The field is at
its maximum limit,

581
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,834
but it is holding!

582
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,083
My visor's picking up
biomagnetic energy.

583
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,959
Highly complex
patterns.

584
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,083
You know, I think
these things are alive.

585
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,000
Reg?

586
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,959
Reg!

587
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,959
Reg...

588
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,834
Life-forms?

589
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,125
That is correct.

590
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,208
They appear to be
quasi-energy microbes

591
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,166
that exist within the distortion
field of the plasma streamer.

592
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,166
We didn't detect them
until we tried to run

593
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:38,000
the resonance
frequency scan.

594
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:39,625
Apparently, they didn't
like it very much.

595
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:42,000
They shattered
the sample container.

596
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,125
Which caused
a plasma explosion

597
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:47,208
similar to the one
on the science ship.
Exactly.

598
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,709
When we linked up with
their transporter system,

599
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,875
one or more of the microbes must
have gotten into our system.

600
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,417
We think they're still
caught in the buffer.

601
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:57,709
It might explain
what you saw.

602
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,041
But what I saw

603
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,542
was much bigger
than a microbe.

604
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,583
Normal spatial
relationships

605
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:07,083
are often distorted
within the matter stream.

606
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,250
Your perceptions may have
been exaggerated.

607
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:11,125
Some of these microbes

608
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,375
are also in
your body, Reg.

609
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:16,000
In... inside me?

610
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:18,375
They were in Lieutenant
Kelly's body as well.

611
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:20,792
That's what caused the
contractions during the autopsy.

612
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:23,750
The biofilters should have
screened them out,
but it didn't.

613
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:27,583
The microbes exist
simultaneously as both
matter and energy.

614
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:30,500
The biofilter cannot distinguish
them from the matter stream.

615
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,125
Right, but if
we held Barclay

616
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:35,208
suspended in
mid-transport,

617
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,500
at the point where matter starts
to lose molecular cohesion...

618
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:41,333
The molecules would begin
to omit nucleonic particles.

619
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,583
We may be able to
derive a pattern

620
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,667
the computer
would recognize.

621
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:48,500
LA FORGE: And then reprogram
the biofilters and screen
the microbes out.

622
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,166
I think
this'll work, Reg.

623
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,250
Suspend me?

624
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,208
I don't like
the sound of this.

625
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,458
Well, we would have to
keep you in there for a while.

626
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,875
How long?

627
00:38:57,917 --> 00:39:01,041
30, 40 seconds--
it's tough to tell.

628
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,625
But I think
it'd be safe.

629
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:06,667
But if-- if I'm in
the matter stream too long...

630
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,625
Your pattern would degrade
to the point

631
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:11,709
where your signal
would be permanently lost.

632
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,834
After 15 seconds or so
in the beam,

633
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:23,375
you may start to
feel lightheaded.

634
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:24,792
Try to stay calm.

635
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:27,041
Oh, and it's important
not to move around too much.

636
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:29,041
Right.

637
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:36,792
Initializing the backup
pattern buffer.

638
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:39,166
Holding at standby.

639
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:40,834
You ready, Reg?

640
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,500
Energize.

641
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:03,000
Molecular resolution
at 60%.

642
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:06,166
Engaging static mode.

643
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:09,917
His pattern is
locked and holding.

644
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,083
Starting biofilter scan.

645
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,000
Signal's holding.

646
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:28,083
The imagining scanner still
haven't isolated the microbes.

647
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,250
I'll try increasing
molecular dispersion.

648
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:32,625
His signal resolution's
down to 55%.

649
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,542
Don't worry,
I can hold him together.

650
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:49,083
Commander, his signal
resolution's down to 50%.

651
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,792
We need to bring him back.
I know, I know.

652
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:53,500
Just give me
one more second.

653
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:55,041
We need more dispersion.

654
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,834
Increase phase
transition frequency.
Aye, sir.

655
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,834
The imagining scanners
are actuating.

656
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,500
Got it.

657
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,667
Pattern acquisition
positive.

658
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:06,792
Programming biofilter.

659
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:10,083
Don't worry, Reg,
this won't hurt a bit.

660
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:24,208
I'm reading a 92%
increase in mass.

661
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,375
There is something
in the beam with him.

662
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,250
Security to
Transporter Room three.
WORF: Right away.

663
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,083
I'm setting up a force field
around the chamber.

664
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,875
Drop the force field.

665
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:54,625
There are more
crew members in the beam.

666
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:56,750
You have to grab them
and hold on.

667
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:58,875
Understood.
Follow me.

668
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:08,667
Reg, what happened?

669
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,709
Well, when I...

670
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,375
when I saw that there was
more than one of them,

671
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:15,083
I... I thought
maybe the other crew

672
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:17,333
were trying to do
the same thing that we were.

673
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,750
We're infected
with something.

674
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:22,000
Lieutenant Kelly tried to

675
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:25,500
reprogram the biofilter.

676
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,625
It looks like he pushed
molecular dispersion

677
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,458
past the integrity point.

678
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,208
Your patterns
got caught in the beam.

679
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,041
The residual energy
from the plasma stream,

680
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:36,417
it must have amplified
the charge in the buffer

681
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:39,000
enough to keep your patterns
from degrading.

682
00:42:56,417 --> 00:43:00,041
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46043.6:</i>

683
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:03,208
<i>The reprogrammed biofilter</i>
<i>was effective in removing</i>

684
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,417
<i>the alien microbes</i>
<i>from Mr. Barclay</i>

685
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,333
<i>and the four crew members.</i>

686
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:10,458
<i>The microbes have been</i>
<i>returned to the plasma stream.</i>

687
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:21,583
Chief.
Lieutenant.

688
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,583
I'm glad
you could make it.

689
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,917
You know, I think this is
the first time we've ever spoken

690
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:28,208
outside of
the Transporter Room.

691
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,792
Well, to be honest,
I've always avoided you.

692
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:32,667
Why?

693
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:35,834
Because you run the transporters
and I hate the transporters.

694
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:37,166
At least I used to.

695
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:39,458
So what's in the box?

696
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,333
I think you might like
to meet Christina.

697
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:49,458
Christina,
Lieutenant Barclay.

698
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:53,667
It's your pet spider.

699
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:56,000
Lycosa tarantula.

700
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:58,333
Don't worry,
she won't bite.

701
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:04,000
She's...

702
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,041
very large.

703
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,959
I found her on Titus IV.

704
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,417
I almost stepped on her
by accident.

705
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:15,166
Oh, I'll get us
a couple of drinks, okay?

706
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,333
Keep an eye on her,
will you?

707
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,458
Sure.

708
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:29,166
Uh, Chief?
