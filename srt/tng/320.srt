00:00:02,709 --> 00:00:06,417
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43779.3:</i>

2
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:09,500
<i>The Enterprise is preparing</i>
<i>detailed exospheric charts</i>

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,792
<i>of the Hayashi system.</i>

4
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:12,166
<i>Although tedious,</i>

5
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,667
<i>this endeavor is</i>
<i>the first step</i>

6
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:16,500
<i>toward planet colonization.</i>

7
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:19,125
Captain, sensors report
the<i> U.S.S. Hood</i>

8
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,083
is closing at
an intercept course

9
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,583
at high warp.

10
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:24,875
That's odd.

11
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:26,417
We weren't notified
of a rendezvous.

12
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,458
They seem to be
in an awful hurry.

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Sir, we are being hailed
on a secured channel

14
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,250
by Captain Desoto.

15
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,875
On screen.

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,041
Sorry to sneak up on you
like that, Jean-Luc.

17
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,125
Robert, why didn't
you inform us?

18
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,875
Out here, you never know
who's listening.

19
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,333
Keeps you on
your toes anyway.

20
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,000
Eh, Will?

21
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,709
Will, you getting soft
on board that luxury liner?

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,166
PICARD:
So, old friend

23
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,500
how are you?

24
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,417
Well you know,
they send you

25
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,083
galaxy-class boys
out here to the far reaches.

26
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,000
Me, I just haul my butt
back and forth

27
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,834
between starbases.

28
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:04,875
But not today.

29
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:07,250
No, not today.

30
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,959
Starfleet's got
new orders for you.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,542
This is top priority.

32
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,000
They need the fastest ship
in the fleet

33
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,583
and the best people.

34
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:14,667
That is you.

35
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,125
If time was so important,

36
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,500
why didn't they transmit
the orders by subspace?

37
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,166
Well,
they're worried about

38
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,834
Romulan eavesdropping
on this one.

39
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,709
<i>And</i> we have
a passenger for you.

40
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,000
Kind of hard to send
by subspace.

41
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,542
What sort of passenger?

42
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,000
Mission specialist.

43
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,291
He'll bring your orders
aboard with him.

44
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,875
His name is Tam Elbrun.

45
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:39,125
As in Tam Elbrun
of the Ghorusda disaster?

46
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,959
The same.

47
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,250
What can I say?

48
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,417
Your orders are to
cooperate fully with him.

49
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,208
Best of luck, folks.

50
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,667
<i>Hood</i> out.

51
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,709
Sir, the<i> Hood</i> is
slowing to impulse.

52
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,500
Mr. Data,
come with me.

53
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:57,125
Captain, may I come
with you to greet Tam?

54
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,583
You know him?

55
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,208
I do, he was at
the university on Betazed

56
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,709
when I was studying
psychology there.

57
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,208
Oh I see, he was
a colleague of yours.

58
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:10,542
No... he was a patient.

59
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:45,625
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

60
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:49,709
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship Enterprise.</i>

61
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,333
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

62
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:55,166
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

63
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,500
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

64
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:04,250
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

65
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,291
Tam is a telepath
of extraordinary talent,

66
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,083
even for a Betazoid.

67
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,917
He's a specialist
in first contact

68
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,333
with new life-forms.

69
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,125
He's a very
unique person,

70
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:27,750
but he's not what you
might expect, Captain.

71
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,083
Welcome aboard
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

72
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,125
I am Captain--
Captain Picard.

73
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,041
Right?

74
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,917
Here.

75
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,166
You want to know
all about your mission.

76
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,208
Everything's on there.
Orders and briefings.

77
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,458
Destination and heading,
all that.

78
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,500
Dee, I sensed
you were out here.

79
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,083
How have you been?

80
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,375
I've been fine,
but I thought...

81
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,125
BOTH:
...you were on Chandra Five?

82
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,125
DATA:
Sir?

83
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,417
Who<i> ... what</i> are you?

84
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:13,875
I am Data,
an android.

85
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,542
Incredible.
An android.

86
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,875
I can't read you
at all.

87
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,542
It's like
you're not there.

88
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,667
PICARD:
Data.

89
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,875
Oh, you better hurry up
to the bridge with that.

90
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:29,208
Captain wants you
to run the orders,

91
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,625
scan the technical
schematics,

92
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:33,000
and be ready to brief him
in ten minutes, right?

93
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,542
Number One?

94
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,917
Riker here.

95
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,542
Will you meet Commander Data
on the bridge?

96
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,291
He has our orders
and new heading.

97
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,500
Aye, sir.

98
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,125
And assemble
the bridge staff

99
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,500
for a mission briefing
in 15 minutes.

100
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:47,750
Picard out.

101
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:48,917
Mister Elbrun,
would you..?

102
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,291
Would I care
to see my quarters?

103
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,709
No.

104
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,583
I'd rather get
this briefing over with,

105
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,250
then be left alone
until I'm needed.

106
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,959
I've heard something
about Ghorusda.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,333
Weren't there about
40 people killed?

108
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,959
47, including the Captain
of the<i> Adelphi,</i>

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,667
two friends from my
class at the academy.

110
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,083
Hmm, sorry.

111
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,166
Main bridge.

112
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,625
So what happened?

113
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:24,125
It was a first-contact
situation.

114
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,375
Ghorusdan culture is
so complex and different

115
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,333
that the federation
sent a specialist

116
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,125
to prevent
misunderstanding.

117
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,583
So that was Tam Elbrun.

118
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,375
What happened
was his fault?

119
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:35,583
Not directly.

120
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,000
Board of inquiry
blamed Darson

121
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,875
for carelessness

122
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:42,333
about Ghorusdan
cultural taboos.

123
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,417
But if Elbrun was so good,
why didn't he warn Darson?

124
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,625
What was he doing there
if he couldn't sense
that much hostility?

125
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:05,625
Our destination is
the Beta Stromgren system

126
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:08,625
following the path
of the Vega Nine probe.

127
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:11,667
That's 23 parsecs beyond our
furthest manned explorations.

128
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,417
That is correct,
Commander.

129
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,667
Apparently the probe has
discovered...

130
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,041
astonishing.

131
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:24,125
Our orders are to proceed
to this star, Beta Stromgren.

132
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,792
Scientists have discovered
it is in the final stages

133
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:29,917
of an alternating cycle
of expansion and collapse

134
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,333
and will soon result
in a supernova.

135
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,375
However, the unmanned,
long ranged space probe

136
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,917
sent by Starfleet
to observe the process

137
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,542
has discovered
something much more.

138
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,917
Oh, oh, Data,
don't waste time.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,542
They call it "Tin Man".

140
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,166
The Vega probe found it
orbiting Stromgren.

141
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,667
Looks like
some kind of ship.

142
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,625
Its energy source
is unknown.

143
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,542
The people who have studied
the transmissions

144
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,959
think it's a starship.

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,083
And they're sure
it's alive.

146
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,792
Alive? How?

147
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,542
A cybernetic organism,
like the Borg?

148
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,625
No, no, no.

149
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:11,291
Here.

150
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,000
Starfleet believes
it's an organic creature

151
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,166
born in space,
living its life

152
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,500
in the wastes
between the stars.

153
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,583
No one knows
where it came from

154
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,125
or why it's here.

155
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,959
But we're going
to meet it.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,917
We're going to talk to it.

157
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:30,291
I'm going to talk to it.

158
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,709
Have attempts been made...

159
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,750
To communicate
with it by subspace?

160
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,583
Of course,
linguacode,

161
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,542
universal translation,
all that, it won't work.

162
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,000
Tin Man is too different.

163
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,709
Direct mind-to-mind contact
is our only hope.

164
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,250
The opportunity for discovery
is extraordinary,

165
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,917
but I don't understand
Starfleet's urgency.

166
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,208
Romulans.

167
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,792
Oh, hell, I forgot.

168
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,041
The Romulans.

169
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,542
They claim
that sector of space

170
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,458
where Beta Stromgren
is located.

171
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,250
The Romulans claim<i> all</i> that
is in their field of vision.

172
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,542
They routinely monitor

173
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,709
the telemetry of
our deep space probes.

174
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,417
And they will certainly be
sending a ship of their own

175
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,875
to investigate
this "Tin Man."

176
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,125
No.

177
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,166
Actually,
they're sending two.

178
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,083
Data?

179
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,583
That is correct.

180
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:18,792
Starbase 123 has detected
two D'deridex-class cruisers

181
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,375
on an intercept course.

182
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:22,083
The top speed
of this class cruiser

183
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,709
is known to be
less than ours.

184
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,125
Therefore, we do have
some advantage.

185
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,208
Then it's a race.

186
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
An alien intelligence,

187
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:37,083
a new life-form
representing a technology

188
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,500
far beyond either the Romulans
or ourselves.

189
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,583
The Romulans will certainly take
whatever measures are required

190
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,583
to secure
this creature for study.

191
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,333
Study as in
"dissecting," I'd bet.

192
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,375
Mr. Data,
you are our resident

193
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:57,250
honor student
in exobiology.

194
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,709
I'm assigning you to head up the
life sciences on this mission.

195
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,000
Aye, sir.
Excellent.

196
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,959
Meeting adjourned, then.

197
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,625
So, Data,
I guess you're the brains

198
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,458
of this outfit, huh?

199
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,333
Mr. Elbrun, one of the reasons
I'm asking you to work closely

200
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,083
with a member of my staff
is to avoid...

201
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,792
<i>further</i> omissions.

202
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,083
The possibility
of an encounter

203
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,458
with the Romulans
on this mission

204
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,709
is hardly trivial,
and yet....

205
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,041
All right, all right.

206
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,959
I should have brought up
the Romulans earlier,

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,709
but I was distracted.

208
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,625
And no, Billy Boy,

209
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,667
I wasn't distracted
on Ghorusda.

210
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:43,875
If Darson had listened to me,
no one would have died.

211
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,583
No?

212
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,875
Well, I don't care whether
you believe that or not.

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,458
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

214
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,291
<i>Traveling at high warp,</i>
<i>we are still</i>

215
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,709
<i>several days from rendezvous</i>
<i>with the mysterious entity</i>

216
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,792
<i>which Starfleet has</i>
<i>christened "Tin Man."</i>

217
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,583
<i>My immediate concern is</i>
<i>with Tam Elbrun.</i>

218
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,500
<i>Starfleet considers</i>
<i>his unique abilities</i>

219
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:15,667
<i>crucial to our mission,</i>

220
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,750
<i>yet he seems to me</i>
<i>unstable.</i>

221
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:22,917
Well, according to his medical
records and psych profile,

222
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,458
he's very high
on the E.S.P. scale.

223
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,709
A sort of prodigy.

224
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,208
A prodigy?
In what sense?

225
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,125
Well, in most Betazoids,

226
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,875
our telepathic gifts
develop at adolescence.

227
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:38,208
You mean you're not
born reading minds?

228
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,875
No, except for some reason
that no one understands,

229
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:45,208
occasionally a Betazoid child
is born different.

230
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,583
How different?

231
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,875
Born with its telepathic
abilities switched on.

232
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,709
Most Betazoids born like that
never lead a normal life.

233
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,959
The noise of other people's
thoughts and feelings

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,709
must be overwhelming,

235
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,500
incomprehensible,
especially to a child.

236
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,291
And painful.

237
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,041
Early diagnosis
and special training

238
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,959
did help Tam adjust,

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,291
but he has
some problems.

240
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:13,333
You mentioned
a hospitalization.

241
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:17,250
For stress-- repeatedly,
throughout his life.

242
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,041
I always wonder
what holds one person together

243
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,333
through that
kind of struggle

244
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,625
while another
goes under?

245
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,500
Yes, well,

246
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:28,917
he's evidently done more
than "hold together."

247
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,208
He's the indispensable man--

248
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,542
the Federation's finest
specialist in communication

249
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,917
with unknown life-forms.

250
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,917
The more unusual
the life-form,

251
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,792
the better he likes it.

252
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:43,667
His personnel file shows
he's gravitated towards

253
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:47,000
assignments that isolate him
from other humanoids.

254
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:54,250
Commander Data,
I'm picking up an unusual echo

255
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,041
on my navigational
sensors.

256
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,834
Something is
out there, sir,

257
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,083
tracking us, matching
our speed and heading.

258
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,333
Something which does
not fully register

259
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,166
on our instruments.

260
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:12,083
Since there is
no known natural phenomenon

261
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,709
capable of travel
at warp velocity,

262
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,750
there are but
two possibilities.

263
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:19,041
Either it is a sensor
malfunction,

264
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,542
or another ship is
following us covertly.

265
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,709
It is not
a sensor malfunction.

266
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,417
Agreed.

267
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,917
WESLEY:
But, Commander,

268
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,542
if it is a Romulan ship,
with their cloaking device,

269
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,291
we shouldn't
pick them up at all.

270
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,041
Unless they're pulling so much
power for something else

271
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,208
that they can't
fully cloak.

272
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,542
Like what?

273
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,166
Ask the Romulans...

274
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,667
if it is the Romulans.

275
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,709
DATA:
Lieutenant,
continue monitoring

276
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,709
the precise position
of the echo.

277
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,166
Any sudden change
in its behavior,

278
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,875
initiate yellow alert.

279
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,250
Aye, sir.

280
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,625
(<i> door chimes</i> )

281
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,000
Come in.

282
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,291
How are things
in the land of the living?

283
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:13,208
I thought
you might be lonely.

284
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,875
No one sees you
except Data.

285
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:18,250
Lonely?

286
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:22,083
I can hear everything that
everyone on this ship thinks,

287
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,917
and no one besides<i> you</i>

288
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,417
seems to be missing
my charming...

289
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,959
You want them
to dislike you.

290
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,542
Why?
Because I'm not
a nice man.

291
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,083
Okay, okay.

292
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,625
Because they scare me.

293
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,291
There are
too many minds.

294
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,834
I can't shut them out.

295
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,166
Never could learn.

296
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,000
All their loves,

297
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,875
their hates,
their fears,

298
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,208
their needs.

299
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,917
It's like a tide
that never ebbs.

300
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,709
I could drown.

301
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,333
I remember.

302
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:08,000
You understood,
at least a little,

303
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,959
how I felt.

304
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,083
I see you finally found
a place to fit in,

305
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,083
people to care about.

306
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,125
And you're
still looking.

307
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:29,375
And then
there's Ghorusda.

308
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:32,291
I have enough doubt
in my reliability

309
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,875
without having to listen
to Riker's and Picard's.

310
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,208
What happened there?

311
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,291
I thought everyone knew.

312
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,792
No. What happened to<i> you?</i>

313
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:50,625
Maybe I got too involved
with the Ghorusdans,

314
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,125
with their point of view.

315
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,041
It happens to me.

316
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,917
I wanted everyone
to get along.

317
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,917
I could have warned Darson
more forcefully.

318
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,333
So, after that,
you ran away.

319
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,583
The last I heard,

320
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,750
you were the only
Federation delegate

321
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,041
assigned
to Chandra Five.

322
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:19,041
Oh, beautiful creatures,
the Chandrans.

323
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:24,125
Their minds are glacial.

324
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,875
They have a lovely
three-day ritual

325
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,417
for saying "hello."

326
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:32,625
Peaceful,
untroubled people.

327
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:34,375
Unlike humanoids?

328
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,166
Well, except for
your friend, Data.

329
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,583
I like him.

330
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:46,458
He's... restful.

331
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:52,291
I believe your impression
of Data is probably unique.

332
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,792
Yeah?

333
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:59,250
Well, having to get
to know someone,

334
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,917
just once,
has its appeal.

335
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,959
I mean,
talking to them

336
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,667
instead of getting it
all at once, up here,

337
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,917
whether I want it or not.

338
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,125
But you accepted
this mission.

339
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,667
You could have stayed
on Chandra Five.

340
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,792
You willingly
came aboard a ship

341
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,291
with over
a thousand people.

342
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,667
How could I not?
Think of it, Dee.

343
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,625
This intelligence that
swims naked through space

344
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,166
like a fish in the sea,

345
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,041
totally alien,

346
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,792
mysterious,

347
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,250
not like us at all.

348
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,125
Ancient...

349
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,208
and alone.

350
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,583
So lonely...

351
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,500
for so long.

352
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,041
How can you know that?

353
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,959
Tam?

354
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,291
You're in contact
with it.

355
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,041
With Tin Man,
aren't you?

356
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,709
No.

357
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,709
Well...

358
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,834
yes, a little,

359
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,375
but not quite
on a conscious level.

360
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,583
We're light-years away.

361
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,542
That's impossible,
even for you.

362
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,417
Impossible for me.

363
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,125
Maybe not impossible
for Tin Man.

364
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,875
Status report,
Number One?

365
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,291
We've reached the outer regions
of the Beta Stromgren system,

366
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,542
on course for
orbital intercept

367
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,625
with the Tin Man,
E.T.A 18 minutes.

368
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,291
Grand.
Not altogether.

369
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,750
Astrophysics reports

370
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:56,000
that the rate of
the star's collapse
has increased.

371
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,834
It could go supernova
in a few days.

372
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,417
DATA:
Captain, we are receiving

373
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,250
relay sensor data
from the Vega probe

374
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,208
including visuals.

375
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,625
On screen.

376
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,583
Magnify.

377
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:15,500
Remarkable.

378
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,792
Computer,
locate Tam Elbrun.

379
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,000
COMPUTER:
Tam Elbrun is in turbolift one

380
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,792
en route
to the main bridge.

381
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,125
Of course.

382
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,000
WORF: Captain,
our sensors are detecting

383
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,875
a subspace wave front
of highly ionized particles

384
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,750
preceding the object
which is tracking us.

385
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:37,709
Yellow alert.
On screen.

386
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,667
Romulan warbird closing.

387
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,750
They are arming
main disruptors, captain.

388
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,458
Order red alert.
Shields to maximum.

389
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,166
Arm photon torpedoes
and stand by, Mr. Worf.

390
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,959
Aye, sir.
I thought you said
the<i> Enterprise</i>

391
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,291
was faster than
this Romulan.

392
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,750
In fact, we are,
Commander, however...

393
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,542
Evasive, Mr. Crusher.
Hailing frequencies.

394
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,500
I guarantee that they don't
want to talk to you, Captain.

395
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,500
WORF:
The Romulan has passed us.

396
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,125
Damage report.

397
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,500
No casualties reported.

398
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:30,166
70 percent loss
to the shields.

399
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,041
Their attack on us was
incidental, Captain.

400
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,125
Incidental?

401
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,750
Yes, to delay us.

402
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,291
Captain, it would appear
the Romulans intent is

403
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,750
to contact "Tin Man" first,
at any cost.

404
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:42,375
According to my
sensor readings,

405
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:45,792
the Warbird has exceeded
maximum engine output by 30%.

406
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:48,667
They seem to have irreparable
damage to their warp coils.

407
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:51,083
So they kept up with us
by sacrificing their ability

408
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,250
to re-enter
Romulan space.

409
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,709
A one-way trip.

410
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,458
There's one more
trailing us, Captain.

411
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,375
A day or two behind.

412
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:00,667
Data's right,
this one's job...

413
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,959
is to beat us
to Tin Man at any cost.

414
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,667
You read all this
telepathically?

415
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:08,959
In the mind of
the Romulan commander,

416
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,542
during the attack.

417
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,458
Very well,
Mr. Crusher, all stop.

418
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,250
Aye, sir.
Commander La Forge?

419
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,625
La forge here.

420
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:21,750
Geordi, how long
to full shield restoration?

421
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,125
I'm working on it.

422
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,709
Computer, reconfigure
structural integrity power

423
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,709
to feed inner
deflector grid.

424
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,083
COMPUTER:
Unable to comply.

425
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,959
Requested reroute
would compromise

426
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
operational
safety limits.

427
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,667
To hell with
the limits, override.

428
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,458
Authorization,
La Forge, Theta 2997.

429
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,375
COMPUTER:
Rerouting structural integrity
power supply.

430
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,959
Russell, watch
the lateral grid balance.

431
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,500
No-no-no,
that's too much.

432
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,917
We'll have to do it
manually.

433
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,834
La Forge to bridge.
PICARD:
Go ahead.

434
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,625
Captain, I'm trying
to feed the inner grid

435
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,959
by stealing some power from
the structural integrity field.

436
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,500
You should have partial
shielding in about 30 minutes.

437
00:21:57,542 --> 00:22:00,000
PICARD:
You have ten.
Picard out.

438
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,792
The Romulans wish
the honor of first contact.

439
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:08,375
Let them have it.

440
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:10,125
You're out of
your mind, Picard.

441
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,166
What if the Romulans find
a way to persuade Tin Man...

442
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,458
I think the chance
of that is remote.

443
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,709
And if you will be
still, Mr. Elbrun,

444
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,750
you may learn...

445
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:18,792
What?

446
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:21,083
That being first
at any cost

447
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,542
is not always
the point.

448
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,709
Mr. Data,
while we await repairs,

449
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,166
I want life sciences
and engineering

450
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,125
to continue collecting
information on the alien.

451
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:33,208
And query the Vega Nine probe,
long-range sensors.

452
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,709
Aye, sir.

453
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,166
You do a lot
of your work here?

454
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,583
Yes.

455
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,166
I have configured
these instruments

456
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:02,041
to display information with
greater speed and efficiency

457
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,667
than stations
used by the others.

458
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:06,709
Nice.

459
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,542
A little spartan.

460
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,709
Spartan?

461
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,709
Lots of work space.

462
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,250
Not much room to live.

463
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,125
I don't guess you sleep.

464
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,375
I have tried it
from time to time,

465
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,834
but you are correct.

466
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,500
I do not
require rest.

467
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:30,834
But you paint.

468
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,333
The creature's anatomy
appears most peculiar.

469
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,917
In what way?

470
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,000
It is indeed
laid out as a vessel

471
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,959
with what appear to be
chambers and corridors.

472
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,125
An internal environment

473
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,959
suitable for
carbon-based life-forms

474
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,875
is being maintained,
yet...

475
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:00,458
there is no evidence
of a crew aboard.

476
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,875
Tin Man is
a living being

477
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:06,625
which has been bred
or has adapted itself

478
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,917
to serve a purpose.

479
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:11,792
I find that
interesting.

480
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,750
Why?

481
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:17,208
Must living beings
have a purpose?

482
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,542
Or do we exist for
no reason but to exist?

483
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,959
I do not believe I am qualified
to express an opinion.

484
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,834
Ah, Data, you're
uniquely qualified.

485
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,750
You think a great deal
about humanity,

486
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,709
and you're
an honest researcher.

487
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,125
You don't treat anything
as trivial or irrelevant.

488
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,000
You want to try it all.

489
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,542
You said in
the transporter room

490
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,375
that you could not
read my mind.

491
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:43,083
True enough.

492
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,417
But I think I understand
you pretty well.

493
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,291
It worries you
that I can't read your mind?

494
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,834
Perhaps there is
nothing to read.

495
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:56,583
Nothing more than mechanisms
and algorithmic responses.

496
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,625
Perhaps you're
just different.

497
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,291
It's not a sin,
you know.

498
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:06,375
Though you may have
heard otherwise.

499
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:17,291
Captain, the Romulan ship
is hailing the alien

500
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,709
using their equivalent
of linguacode.

501
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,959
Response?

502
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,166
DATA:
Nothing so far,
Commander.

503
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:22,750
TAM:
Why should it answer?

504
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:24,750
What could it possibly have
in common with them?

505
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:27,000
But you're so sure
it'll talk to you?

506
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:30,000
Captain, the Romulans are
arming all disruptors.

507
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,917
Yellow alert.
Prepare for evasive action

508
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,500
of the first change
in the Romulans' course.

509
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:34,834
RIKER: With our shields
in this position, we can't...

510
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,291
No, no...

511
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,291
we're not the target.

512
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:41,041
It's Tin Man.

513
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,917
What do you mean?

514
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,542
Do they intend
to destroy it?

515
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:47,667
Those are their orders
if they can't secure the alien.

516
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:50,959
Increase speed to intercept
the Romulan vessel.

517
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,583
Their lead is
too great, sir.

518
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:53,959
Hail them.
We can not allow them...

519
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,750
They won't listen
to you!

520
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,458
Danger.

521
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,959
Gomtuu... do not allow.

522
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,917
Damage report!

523
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,750
WORF:
Nothing available yet, sir.

524
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:32,625
We have partial failure
of the main computer.

525
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,959
It seems you woke...

526
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,792
your Tin Man.

527
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:51,750
We've got impulse power,

528
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:53,625
but I've got to take
the warp engines offline

529
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,041
while we recalibrate
the intermix regulators.

530
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,500
How long?
For everything

531
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,417
or just for
the warp engines?
All of it.

532
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,250
Commander, we're looking
at 20 hours work here,

533
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:01,750
double shifts.

534
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:04,417
We don't know that
we have 20 hours.

535
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,417
That star could
explode at any moment.

536
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,792
I know.

537
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,000
Okay, first thing
we need to do is

538
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,208
get the main computer
working right--

539
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,875
No, we fix
the shields first--

540
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:15,291
Commander, whatever
Tin Man hit us with,

541
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,000
it fried circuits
I thought were unfryable.

542
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,291
I'm not worried
about Tin Man.

543
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,500
It's more Romulans
showing up.

544
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,542
Right. First priority,
get the shields up.

545
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:26,417
Only, let's not have anymore
surprises until I'm done, okay?

546
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:28,542
Don't ask me
about surprises.

547
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,041
Ask Tam Elbrun.

548
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,792
Your brain activity
suggests you're coming out

549
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:38,750
of some sort
of a fugue or seizure.

550
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:41,375
Your blood pressure
and glucose are indicative

551
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:44,000
of general
systemic stress.

552
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,333
But I'm gonna live?

553
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:47,166
No doubt about it.

554
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,709
Good.

555
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,709
Because I want to know
exactly what you did.

556
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,041
I want to know how closely
you're in communication

557
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,542
with this alien
and what you've learned from it.

558
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:56,625
And I want to know now!

559
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,709
I... I...

560
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,291
I just warned it,
that's all.

561
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:03,583
I've been
in contact with it,

562
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,458
sensing impressions
from it.

563
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,709
It calls itself Gomtuu.

564
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,917
It's old, Captain.

565
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:15,125
It's roamed the universe
for many thousands of years.

566
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,291
Where did it come from?
How many...

567
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,875
Far away.

568
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:22,834
Maybe beyond
the galaxy.

569
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,875
Once, there were
millions of them.

570
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,667
Once?

571
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:32,500
It hasn't seen another
of its kind for millennia.

572
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:36,125
It's alone.

573
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,542
It may be the last
of its species.

574
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,583
Perhaps...

575
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,792
we can help it
in some way.

576
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:50,417
Can you ask it

577
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:53,667
to return with us
to Federation space?

578
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:56,417
At least persuade it

579
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,625
to leave the vicinity
of Beta Stromgren

580
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,500
before the star explodes?

581
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:05,291
Captain, Gomtuu knows
the star will go nova soon.

582
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,959
That's why it's here.
It wants to die.

583
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,208
There was...

584
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,542
an explosion in space.

585
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:21,041
Radiation penetrating
the outer layers.

586
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:23,667
The crew...

587
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:26,625
(<i> heavy sighing</i> )

588
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,250
the crew...

589
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,834
died.

590
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:35,333
Such loss...

591
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:39,375
empty pain...
hollowness...

592
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:42,959
Tam, stop this.

593
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,709
You're losing yourself
in this merging.

594
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,583
I know, I know.

595
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:55,000
Tin Man hurts
and wants to die.

596
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,917
I can't do any more
from out here.

597
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,917
If you want me
to really reach Tin Man,

598
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:01,583
I have got to be
in physical contact.

599
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,208
I have got
to go aboard.

600
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,000
No that is absolutely
out of the question.

601
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,834
You don't trust me?

602
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,500
No, Tam, I don't
believe that I do.

603
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:15,291
Tam...

604
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:19,917
when you reached out
to the alien to warn it,

605
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:22,166
did you give any thought
to this vessel?

606
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,875
To the danger,
however inadvertent,

607
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:28,458
that creature might
pose to our crew,

608
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,166
or did you simply
react out of instinct?

609
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,542
Captain...
Deanna...

610
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,417
he's right.

611
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,083
I don't know,
I don't know
what might happen,

612
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:43,750
but if you don't let me go,
we fail our mission.

613
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,583
Besides,
at this point,

614
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:48,542
you need all the help
you can get,

615
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,834
even Tin Man's.

616
00:30:56,667 --> 00:31:00,500
Russell, reactivate
the sensor assemblies.

617
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,583
Okay.

618
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,709
Let's do a program reload,
port array only.

619
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:09,250
Good, that's good.

620
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:11,417
Computer, run
a level-two diagnostic.

621
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:14,583
COMPUTER:
Port sensor array
remains off-line.

622
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,125
Damn!

623
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,208
RIKER:
Riker to La Forge.
How's it coming?

624
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,583
Not good.

625
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,333
I think all the control
processes are shot.

626
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,834
But maybe if I swap the chips
from the secondary array,

627
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,583
I can give you
a minimum E.M. scan.

628
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,792
RIKER:
Do it.

629
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:31,667
Okay, Russell,
we're going to try

630
00:31:31,709 --> 00:31:35,291
starting retro sensor
element 32 only.

631
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,500
You in?

632
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:42,291
Go.

633
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,000
(<i> whistles</i> )

634
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:49,625
The good news is we have
partial long range sensors.

635
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:53,125
La Forge to Bridge.
Riker here.

636
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,875
I'm picking up another echo on
the long range sensor display.

637
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:58,208
You reading that on your panel?
Worf?

638
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,166
One moment, Commander.

639
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,959
Confirmed.

640
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,875
Sir, the other Romulan ship
on an intercept course.

641
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:11,250
Geordi, are we gonna have
those shields anytime soon?

642
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:12,834
GEORDI:
I'm doing the best I can.

643
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:16,166
But shields won't help
if that star explodes.

644
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:20,333
Data, you seem to have developed
an affinity with Elbrun.

645
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:23,458
Troi, you've
known him for years.

646
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,583
How far can he be trusted?

647
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,875
Captain, the issue
isn't one of trust

648
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:30,458
in Tam's intentions
but in his judgment.

649
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,083
I would trust him to do
what he believes is right.

650
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,750
Yes, of course,
but his judgment...

651
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,250
Is precarious.

652
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,750
The stress of exposure
to so many minds

653
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,834
on the ship is bad enough.

654
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:45,834
Now he's strongly drawn
to this creature.

655
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:47,417
I'm afraid for him.

656
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,542
Afraid of what?

657
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:53,166
I sense that the alien
is somehow calling him.

658
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,917
If we allow him
to do as he insists--

659
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,959
to beam over--

660
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,125
I believe that we will
lose him to it.

661
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,500
That he will
lose himself.

662
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:07,375
Captain, I agree that
Tam's motives are trustworthy.

663
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:09,333
And I do not believe
it is possible

664
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:11,291
that he will
act against us

665
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:14,500
or will cause Tin Man to act
against us out of malice.

666
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:17,917
Captain, if Tam
breaks down over there,

667
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:20,333
we'll be no closer
to accomplishing our mission.

668
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:23,917
It will be
a grave mistake.

669
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:26,000
Thank you both.

670
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,458
Data?

671
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,083
I am puzzled, sir.

672
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,417
We have come this far.

673
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:40,417
Are you not going to allow Tam
to fulfill his mission?

674
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,250
Tam Elbrun warned Tin Man.

675
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:47,125
The first thing it did
was to destroy a space vessel.

676
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,875
I believe
I understand, sir.

677
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:52,834
If you feel the risk
is too great

678
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:56,125
to send Tam Elbrun alone,
then send me with him.

679
00:33:56,166 --> 00:34:00,125
Counselor Troi
understands him better.

680
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:03,208
But he is more
comfortable with me, sir.

681
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,000
It is humanity
he is fleeing.

682
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,709
Sir, I could serve
as an intermediary-

683
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,417
a bridge back.

684
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,917
A reminder of
his obligation

685
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:15,583
both to us
and to Tin Man.

686
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:28,709
Captain, the Romulan
has uncloaked.

687
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,709
Status, Number One?

688
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,250
Shields are at 40%.

689
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:33,625
We can maneuver
on impulse, sir.

690
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,542
WORF:
Phasers available
on manual, sir.

691
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,667
Computer target lock
not functioning.

692
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:41,959
Well, let's hope
they're in a mood to talk.

693
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,083
Hailing frequencies.
Open.

694
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,000
Romulan vessel,

695
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:51,125
this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the U.S.S.<i> Enterprise.</i>

696
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,542
<i>Enterprise,</i>

697
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:56,667
your presence here is
a violation of Romulan space.

698
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:58,625
You will leave immediately.

699
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:01,709
We are not familiar

700
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,083
with the terms of your claim
on this sector.

701
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,750
We are here engaged
in scientific research.

702
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:09,333
Do you wish to participate?

703
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:12,333
We have monitored the
destruction of our sister ship

704
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,250
by the star creature.

705
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,250
We claim right of vengeance.

706
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,250
We will destroy the alien.

707
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:22,667
If you interfere,
we will destroy you as well.

708
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:37,417
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

709
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,542
<i>A confrontation between</i>
<i>the Romulan warbird</i>

710
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,500

00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,250

712
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:47,208
<i>but to rely on the telepathic</i>
<i>abilities of Tam Elbrun.</i>

713
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,792
Picard to Tam Elbrun.
TAM: Captain.

714
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:52,166
Report to Transporter
Room Six immediately.
Captain, I don't...

715
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:55,166
Commander Data
will meet you there.
TAM: Yes, Captain.

716
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,583
Counselor, we no longer
have a choice.

717
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:28,834
No, no! Too much! Too much!

718
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,333
Tam?
I can't.

719
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,375
Data to<i> Enterprise.</i>
<i>Enterprise,</i> come in.

720
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:35,291
No, no, don't.

721
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,625
If it is harming you,
we must return.

722
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,542
<i>Enterprise,</i> respond.

723
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:41,375
No, it's all right now,
it's all right.

724
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:44,917
Gomtuu is trying to communicate
a lifetime of experiences to me

725
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:47,333
in a few seconds.

726
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:50,041
But I'm all right now.

727
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,959
O'Brien to Bridge.
PICARD: Go ahead, Chief.

728
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,166
I've lost the transporter
lock on them.

729
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,500
Some kind of
force field went up.

730
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:02,792
Confirmed, the alien
has thrown up a shield.

731
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:06,542
It is blocking
all our sensors.

732
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:08,000
Captain.

733
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,750
The Romulans'
weapons systems

734
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,834
are now at full power.

735
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:16,792
PICARD:
Follow them in, Mr. Crusher.

736
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,291
Red alert.
Mr. Worf, arm photon torpedoes.

737
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,375
Aye, sir.

738
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:47,375
Yes.

739
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,375
There is a large chamber
20 meters ahead.

740
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:06,834
I know.

741
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,917
I know everything now.

742
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:11,000
Come on.

743
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:54,000
Intriguing.

744
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,166
This is the
control center,

745
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:02,667
where Gomtuu's crew
guided their journeys.

746
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:08,250
The ship and the crew
existed symbiotically.

747
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,542
They needed one another.

748
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,083
When Gomtuu had
no one left to care for,

749
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:15,583
it no longer had
a reason to exist.

750
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:20,041
Is that the purpose
of existence?

751
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,917
To care for someone?

752
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,125
It is for me.

753
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:28,250
Deanna was right.

754
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:30,709
I'll lose myself here.

755
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:51,625
I must remind you
that our objective

756
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,583
is to bring Tin Man
out of danger

757
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,875
and report our findings
to Starfleet.

758
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:59,208
I'm not going back, Data.

759
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,542
I'm staying here.

760
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:07,667
WORF:
Sir, the Romulans
are hailing us.

761
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:10,500
Captain Picard,
if you interfere with us,

762
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,417
we will fire
upon you as well.

763
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:16,083
Commander, we are prepared to
defend the life of the alien.

764
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,041
Screen off.
Shields up.

765
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,792
Power levels aboard
the alien are increasing, sir.

766
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:23,041
Captain, the diameter of
the star has been decreased

767
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,125
by 100,000 kilometers.

768
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,333
It's beginning.

769
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,625
Explain to them.

770
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,583
Make them understand.

771
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:48,083
But our mission...
Is to save Tin Man.

772
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:51,458
And I will, but he's going
to save me as well.

773
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,834
All my life,
I have waited for this--

774
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,959
a chance to find peace.

775
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,458
Finally,
all the voices are silent.

776
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,125
Only Tin Man speaks to me now.

777
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,417
Don't you see, Data?

778
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:12,792
<i>This</i> is where I belong.

779
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:28,625
That star is going to go
any minute, sir.

780
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:30,750
The Romulans know that
as well as we do.

781
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:33,041
Power levels aboard
Tin Man are increasing

782
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,750
beyond our sensor range.

783
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,291
Conn, report.

784
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,417
Dead stop, Captain.

785
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:04,041
Sir, we've been thrown
clear of Beta Stromgren,

786
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:07,125
a distance of
3.8 billion kilometers.

787
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:10,083
There is no sign of Tin Man

788
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:12,166
or the Romulans, sir.

789
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:18,917
Captain, on screen.

790
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:34,583
Data...

791
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,709
DATA:
Sir?

792
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,208
Data, what happened
over there?

793
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,667
Difficult to explain, sir.

794
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:47,667
Tam?

795
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:51,041
I believe he found what
he was looking for, Counselor.

796
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

797
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,542
<i>With all main systems</i>
<i>at least temporarily restored,</i>

798
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:01,750
<i>we are proceeding</i>
<i>to Starbase 152</i>

799
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,875
<i>for inspection</i>
<i>and additional repairs.</i>

800
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:06,250
<i>We have had no further</i>
<i>encounters with the Romulans.</i>

801
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:10,375
<i>As for the whereabouts</i>
<i>of Tin Man and Tam Elbrun,</i>

802
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:13,000
<i>we can only speculate.</i>

803
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:15,166
You sent for me?

804
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:16,959
Yes, Counselor.

805
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,959
It was Tam's final request

806
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,625
that I explain
his decision to the crew,

807
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:25,667
but I believe it was his hope
that you would understand.

808
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,250
What did happen?

809
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:35,417
I witnessed something...

810
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:37,166
remarkable.

811
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:40,291
Individually,
they were both so...

812
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,709
Wounded.

813
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,291
Isolated.

814
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,750
Yes.

815
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,959
But no longer.

816
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,166
Through joining,

817
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:53,458
they have been healed.

818
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,792
Grief has been
transmuted to joy.

819
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:01,291
Loneliness to belonging.

820
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:08,583
Data, you do understand.

821
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:10,709
Yes, Counselor.

822
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,417
When Tin Man returned me
to the<i> Enterprise,</i>

823
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:19,417
I realized this
is where I belong.
