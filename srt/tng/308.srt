1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,417
Computer, dispatches.

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,000
A research inquiry

3
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,458
from the Manitoba Journal
of Interplanetary Psychology

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,291
and three communiques
from your mother.

5
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:24,834
Transfer the letters from
my mother to the view screen.

6
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:34,834
And computer, I would like
a real chocolate sundae.

7
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:38,125
Define "real" in context,
please.

8
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,500
Real.

9
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:42,709
Not one of your
perfectly synthesized

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,041
ingeniously enhanced
imitations.

11
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:52,208
I would like
real chocolate ice cream,

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,458
real whipped cream...

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,959
This unit is programmed

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,959
to provide sources
of acceptable nutritional value.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,208
Your request does not fall
within current guidelines.

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,709
Please indicate whether
you wish

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,834
to override
the specified program.

18
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,041
Listen--

19
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,750
PICARD:
Picard to Counselor Troi.

20
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:12,375
Now what?

21
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,166
Yes, Captain?

22
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,875
The pleasure of your company
is requested, Counselor.

23
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:18,417
We are, um... we're having
an little impromptu reception

24
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,417
for the arriving delegates.

25
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,583
Captain, I'm not really
dressed for a reception.

26
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,959
Oh, Counselor,
just throw on any old thing.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,250
We're about to get
our first look at the wormhole.

28
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,792
Of course, Captain.

29
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:30,792
I'm on my way.

30
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:37,458
God forbid I should miss
my first look at the wormhole.

31
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,375
May I escort you,
Miss Troi?

32
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:44,959
Just tell me there's
some chocolate here.

33
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,500
PICARD:
Ah, Counselor Troi.

34
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:49,500
Will you allow me to do
the introductions?

35
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,291
This is Premier Bhavani
of Barzan.

36
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,875
Counselor Deanna Troi.

37
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,291
Your discovery has produced

38
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,709
a great deal of excitement,
Premier.

39
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,083
Hopefully it will
also produce

40
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,041
a new era of prosperity
for my people.

41
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,875
We'll see to that.

42
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:05,667
You know Mr. Mendoza,
the Federation negotiator.

43
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,625
A pleasure to see you again,
Counselor Troi.

44
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:11,667
This is a worthy Federation
competitor in the bidding,

45
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,792
Leyor of
the Caldonians.

46
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,208
Madam.

47
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,083
MAN:
And I am
Devinoni Ral.

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,125
Ship's Counselor,
Deanna Troi.

49
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,625
MENDOZA:
My good friend
Ral is

50
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:29,000
the best hired gun
in the business.

51
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,542
Hired gun?

52
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,917
My good friend Mendoza means
that I'm a negotiator

53
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,417
who serves
a variety of clients.

54
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,542
On this particular occasion,
I represent the Chrysalians.

55
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,000
BHAVANI: I believe it's almost
time, isn't it, Captain?

56
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,208
Indeed.

57
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,417
It will be visible
directly ahead.

58
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,875
Is it always on time,
Bhavani?

59
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,333
Always.

60
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:58,417
We see it every
233 minutes.

61
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,834
Our scientists say
it's due

62
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,208
to radiation buildup
in the accretion disk.

63
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,333
The visible burst
is very brief.

64
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,041
There it is, ladies
and gentlemen, the first

65
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,709
and only stable wormhole
known to exist.

66
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:20,959
It's yours,
for the right price.

67
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:58,083
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

68
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:02,500
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship Enterprise.</i>

69
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,750
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

70
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:07,583
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

71
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:12,208
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

72
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,291
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

73
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,667
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43385.6.</i>

74
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:20,834
<i>We are orbiting Barzan Two,</i>
<i>which is entertaining bids</i>

75
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,458
<i>for control of what appears</i>
<i>to be a stable wormhole,</i>

76
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,625
<i>which could provide</i>
<i>a permanent shortcut</i>

77
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,917
<i>to the distant</i>
<i>Gamma Quadrant.</i>

78
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,583
As you all know,

79
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,375
the environment
on my planet

80
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:36,959
is completely inhospitable
to most other life-forms.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,291
So I'd like to express
my appreciation

82
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,125
to you,
Captain Picard,

83
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,083
for hosting
these negotiations.

84
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,959
The Barzan has been
a society

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,917
dependent on others
for generations.

86
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,458
We want that to end.

87
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,542
The appearance of this stable
wormhole in our space

88
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,792
provides us with our first
true natural resource.

89
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,834
We have neither
the experience

90
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,458
nor the technology
to exploit it.

91
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,208
But you do.

92
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,458
RIKER:
Excuse me.

93
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,166
There's a delegation
of Ferengi

94
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,375
that wishes
to be beamed aboard, sir.

95
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,000
Were you expecting
the Ferengi, Premier?

96
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,834
No, but I do not wish
to create ill will, Captain.

97
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,166
If they are interested
in bidding,

98
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,542
I have no objection.

99
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,959
Chief O'Brien,
this is Captain Picard.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,625
Will you beam
the Ferengi directly

101
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:30,917
to the observation lounge?

102
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,333
O'BRIEN:
Aye, sir.

103
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,959
On behalf of all Ferengi,
I protest.

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,834
Why were we not invited
to these negotiations?

105
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,417
BHAVANI:
My apologies.

106
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,542
We did not anticipate
your interest.

107
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,667
You're welcome
to join us.

108
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,333
My name is DaiMon Goss.

109
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,709
And these are my consuls,
Kol and Dr. Arridor.

110
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,250
We'll need chairs.

111
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,792
I'm Captain Picard
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

112
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,208
I am serving as host
for these proceedings.

113
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,458
Good, then see to it
we get some chairs.

114
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,959
Let me explain--

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,875
Fine, fine, just have
your Klingon servant

116
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,125
get us some chairs.

117
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,542
I'm in charge
of security.

118
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,625
Then who gets
the chairs?

119
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,542
DaiMon, due to
the delicate nature

120
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,208
of these negotiations,
all parties

121
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,583
have agreed that
one representative

122
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,667
will suffice. Now I will
be happy to provide

123
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,041
your consuls
with accommodations

124
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,875
and<i> you</i> may have
<i>my</i> chair.

125
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,125
Very well.

126
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,083
Premier.

127
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:38,583
<i>( sighs )</i>

128
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,417
Kol, the bag.

129
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,792
RIKER:
Gentlemen, this way.

130
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:45,500
We can handle all
the pleasantries later.

131
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:48,125
Now, let's get
down to business.

132
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,208
I'll match anyone's
best offer

133
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,250
<i>and</i> add the gold
on top of it.

134
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,458
<i>( chuckling )</i>

135
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,792
COMPUTER:
Devinoni Ral,
human, age 41.

136
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:07,291
Born Brussels,
European Alliance.

137
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,792
Relocated at age 19
to Hurkos Three.

138
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:11,834
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come in.

139
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:21,041
Should I call
for an appointment?

140
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,041
No.

141
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,583
I was just looking
over some personnel files.

142
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,583
Well, that's too bad.

143
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,375
Thought you might
be thinking about me.

144
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:33,583
I thought you'd be deep
in negotiations by now.

145
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,208
In recess.

146
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,333
I never play the opening
rounds, anyway.

147
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,250
Inconsequential.

148
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,458
Besides, there are
much better things

149
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,709
to negotiate
on this ship...

150
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,000
like dinner tonight?

151
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,750
What about your
traveling companion?

152
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,917
My traveling companion
is... traveling.

153
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,667
I sent her home.

154
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,917
Why?

155
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,959
You know why.

156
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:09,125
Weren't you
getting along?

157
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,542
Don't do that.
What?

158
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:15,333
Don't do
"Counselor" Troi.

159
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,041
Was I?
Yes, you were.

160
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:27,291
When you leave
this office...

161
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,291
who are you?

162
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,834
Oh, so that's
how it goes.

163
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,375
You never do.

164
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,083
You never do...

165
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:43,458
leave...
the office.

166
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,125
What are--
Shh-shh-shh.

167
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,959
Dinner at 8:00?

168
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,166
The readings from the Barzans'
probe of the wormhole

169
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,083
are quite impressive,
Captain.

170
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,291
The wormhole
delivered the probe

171
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,208
beyond the Denkiri Arm
in the Gamma Quadrant.

172
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,125
(<i> whistles</i> )

173
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,250
It would take nearly
a century at warp 9

174
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,959
to cover
that distance.

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,166
The same distance could be
achieved in a matter of seconds

176
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,291
through the wormhole.
Mm.

177
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,500
Imagine the Ferengi, collecting
tolls if we lose to them.

178
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,125
I don't think
the Ferengi are

179
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,417
the greatest threat
at the table.

180
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,959
With all of
DaiMon Goss's bluster,

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
they don't have the resources
the Barzans need.

182
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,709
Mm-hmm. I think
that Devinoni

183
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,917
is the one that we need
to watch out for.

184
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,750
An accurate observation.

185
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,375
How did you
recognize that?

186
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,417
Well he was the most
comfortable one in the group.

187
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,375
You must play poker,
Commander.

188
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:10,208
Poker? Is that a game
of some sort?

189
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,291
Commander Riker conducts
master classes in poker.

190
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,875
Our skills are
not dissimilar, Commander.

191
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:20,291
Mr. Mendoza, if this
lives up to its billing,

192
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:24,542
it will be a discovery
of extraordinary value.

193
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,750
But it is
a very big "if."

194
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,917
a wormhole is there one moment
and then gone the next.

195
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,041
A stable wormhole
is unheard of.

196
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,667
Are you saying this
may not be what it seems?

197
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,709
The Barzans do not have
manned space travel,

198
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,208
so they had to resort to
an automated probe.

199
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,792
Its findings are limited.

200
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:41,792
It cannot be determined
from these charts

201
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,208
how stable
the wormhole<i> really</i> is,

202
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,250
or how long it will
remain intact.

203
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,834
The Federation
could end up buying

204
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,208
a proverbial lemon.

205
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,750
"Proverbial lemon"?

206
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,417
Later, data.
Aye, sir.

207
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,917
And of course,
that means

208
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,917
once the contract
is negotiated and closed,

209
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,583
we would be obliged
to fulfill the terms.

210
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,792
I think we should take a look
for ourselves.

211
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,709
I don't think Bhavani
could object to that.

212
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,792
Geordi has been in
continuous visual contact

213
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,041
with the wormhole,
Captain.

214
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,291
I think it's
a logical choice.

215
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,792
I would also like
to volunteer, sir.

216
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,417
Mm, nobody's going in there
until we have done

217
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,375
a full sensor
analysis.

218
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,875
I want to do everything possible
to determine

219
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:18,709
that it is safe,
and when I am satisfied

220
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,875
then you, Data,
and Commander La Forge

221
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:24,750
will enter the wormhole,
tomorrow.

222
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:30,625
Just a moment of discomfort
for a good cause, DaiMon.

223
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,125
You understand this
will not be lethal?

224
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,709
Doctor,
you surprise me.

225
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,834
I have no wish
to kill anyone.

226
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,458
A short-term crippling
will suffice.

227
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,709
Then, this will
be just fine.

228
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,417
A distillation of your
own blood pyrocytes--

229
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:51,750
harmless to you, undetectable
by the ship's bio-filters,

230
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:54,750
but when absorbed
through your victim's skin

231
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:58,750
it will provoke an extreme
allergic reaction.

232
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:01,500
I'd say it's time to extend
the hand of the Ferengi

233
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:04,125
to the representative
of the Federation.

234
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,000
Much better.

235
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,500
Thank you.

236
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:19,083
Come in for a drink?

237
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,000
Ah, Federation decor.

238
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,208
Not your style?

239
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,166
Well, conformity
is not my style.

240
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,709
What would you like?

241
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,208
I'd even like another.

242
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,917
Well, there she is again.

243
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,583
Counselor Troi.
I'm not.

244
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,959
Computer, champagne.

245
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,333
For two.

246
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,083
Am I moving
too fast for you?

247
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:18,208
No, I'm moving
too fast for me.

248
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,333
I like that better.

249
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,792
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about you all day.

250
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,417
You must have had
a nice day.

251
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,834
Anticipation is fun.

252
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,083
We'll be late
for dinner.

253
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,166
Very late.

254
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:26,792
Mr. Mendoza?

255
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:29,208
I seem to be
a bit warm.

256
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,667
I need some help here.

257
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:38,041
You attempt to gain
every unfair advantage, Picard.

258
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,750
Premier Bhavani
has no objection.

259
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,625
Well, I most
certainly do.

260
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,709
First, you conveniently
arrange to play host,

261
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,875
then you plan to send
a manned probe

262
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:49,667
into the wormhole.
The Federation thinks

263
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:51,291
it can do anything
it wants to.

264
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,959
Well I will not
tolerate it!

265
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,709
I will gladly share
the results

266
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,333
of our explorations
with all the delegates.

267
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,542
And you expect us to believe
what you report?

268
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,583
Then send in
your own probe, Goss.

269
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,583
That's exactly
what I intend to do.

270
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,750
And I should strongly suggest
that<i> you</i> stay out of our way!

271
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,750
Tell Data and La Forge
to do themselves a favor

272
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:21,417
and stay
out of their way.

273
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,959
CRUSHER:
Captain Picard,
please come to sick bay.

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,834
Acknowledged, Doctor.

275
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,208
CRUSHER:
Whatever he's got

276
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,333
is obviously not
life-threatening.

277
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:40,166
It's some kind of system-wide
histaminic reaction.

278
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,417
He certainly
can't go back

279
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,542
to negotiations
for several days.

280
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,333
Will you keep me
informed?

281
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,125
Mm.

282
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,417
The Federation's
top negotiator

283
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,542
taken out by
a mysterious ailment.

284
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,875
Suspicion?

285
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:03,583
With the Ferengi around?
Always.

286
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,375
You'll have to fill in,
Number One.
Me?

287
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,041
Well I am
the designated host.

288
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,959
It would be a most
awkward transition.

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,250
You're the next
likely choice.

290
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,834
And Mr. Mendoza
will certainly agree.

291
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,375
He's quite impressed
by your natural instincts.

292
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,333
Excuse me sir, but those
weren't natural instincts,

293
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,250
those were
poker instincts.

294
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,709
A card game doesn't exactly
prepare me for this.

295
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,709
Yes, the stakes
are higher.

296
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,959
But then,
isn't that when

297
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,333
the game gets interesting,
Commander?

298
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,458
The wormhole will reappear
in 30 seconds, sir.

299
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,875
WORF:
The Ferengi pod
is moving into position.

300
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,041
Shuttle nine,
stand by.

301
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,542
Ferengi pod, this is
Lieutenant Commander La Forge

302
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,458
in the<i> Enterprise</i>
shuttle.

303
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,041
This is Dr. Arridor.
Go ahead.

304
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,959
Would you care to take
the point, Doctor?

305
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,750
We will gladly yield
that honor to<i> you,</i>

306
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,542
Lieutenant Commander.

307
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,875
You know,
if this doesn't work,

308
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:08,667
the thought of spending
the rest of my life in here

309
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:11,583
is none too appealing.

310
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,834
There is a bright side,
Geordi.

311
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,375
You will have<i> me</i>
to talk to.

312
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:23,750
DATA:
It is visible, Captain.

313
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,500
Proceed when ready.

314
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,625
DATA:
...and intense energy fields

315
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:40,291
(<i> audio distorting</i> )
which appear to be stable--

316
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,417
They've traveled beyond our
communication capability, sir.

317
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,750
A complete analysis
of our bid is available

318
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,375
on the ship's computer
for your consideration.

319
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,959
Commander, I realize
what a difficult position

320
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,583
this must be for you.

321
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,542
If you don't
understand something,

322
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,625
I hope you won't be
too embarrassed to ask me.

323
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,291
I think I have an idea
what the rules are.

324
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,875
Well, that's what makes it
so interesting.

325
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:05,417
The rules of the game change
to fit the moment.

326
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:09,375
Not unlike commanding
a starship, Mr. Ral.

327
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,917
Well, Mr. Riker's
placed a--

328
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,917
a great deal
of emphasis on defense,

329
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:16,333
a subject he obviously
knows well

330
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:20,125
having served Starfleet
in a number of conflicts.

331
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,959
Now, the Chrysalians?

332
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,917
We're enemies
to no one...

333
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,417
and we choose
to remain that way.

334
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,333
Neutral.

335
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,125
Neutral, and uninvolved,
sir...

336
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,500
in virtually all interstellar
matters of consequence.

337
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,208
No one would claim that
the Chrysalians

338
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,917
are as powerful as
the mighty Federation.

339
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,667
But, we have resources,

340
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:49,750
and technology,
and scientists, too.

341
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:53,125
But we also have had peace
for ten generations.

342
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,750
RAL:
You know,
I was thinking...

343
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,458
TROI:
Mmm?

344
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,875
RAL:
Maybe I could stretch out
these negotiations

345
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,500
for a few days.

346
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,083
Would you like that?

347
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,792
TROI:
Mm-hmm.

348
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,333
Devinoni Ral...

349
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,834
who<i> are</i> you?

350
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:26,250
Well what do your Betazoid
senses tell you about me?

351
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,333
Not much.

352
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:33,917
My human physical response
must be blocking them out.

353
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,667
Good.

354
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,166
It never happened
to me before.

355
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:45,667
I rather like that
I'm more difficult to read

356
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,917
than your other men.

357
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:51,375
There aren't any others...

358
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,500
currently.

359
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,458
What about Commander Riker?

360
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,166
Who have you been
talking to?

361
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,417
No one.

362
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,333
No one, I just
sensed something

363
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,542
when I saw the two
of you together.

364
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,041
Will Riker and I
are good friends.

365
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,208
Uh-huh.

366
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,166
It was once a little more
than that.

367
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,208
Ah.

368
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,583
How come we're talking
about me instead of you?

369
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,291
Haven't you had enough people
talk about their lives to you?

370
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,709
Who counsels
the Counselor?

371
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,792
Oh, no.

372
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:47,250
I want to know about you.

373
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,917
I'm what you see
right now.

374
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:55,250
Just me... wanting to run
away with you,

375
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,417
but knowing you'd never leave
this damned ship.

376
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:03,583
When I first saw you,

377
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,291
I felt as if
I'd been waiting for you.

378
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:11,041
I'm trying to understand

379
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,625
why or how that's possible.

380
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,000
Does it matter?

381
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:24,458
Well, it will,
when I tell you.

382
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,750
But you must promise never to
tell anyone else.

383
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:30,458
What?

384
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:35,959
I am part Betazoid, too.

385
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,917
My mother was one-half.
I am one-quarter.

386
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,959
You're empathic?

387
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,208
The only one
of five children.

388
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,875
I must admit, I was--

389
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,959
I was never as comfortable
sensing emotions

390
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,458
as you seem to be.

391
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,458
So that's why
you left Earth?

392
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,709
Yes.

393
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,917
I've learned to live with it,
use it, as you have.

394
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:06,208
But, still...

395
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,500
it isolates us,
doesn't it?

396
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:11,458
And I thought
it always would,

397
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,333
so I tucked
my heart away.

398
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,875
I didn't need it.
I didn't want it.

399
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:22,000
At the negotiating table,

400
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,250
it can be fatal
to have a heart.

401
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:32,083
But I never realized
how much I needed mine...

402
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,291
until I looked at you.

403
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,625
I'm picking up an increase
in accretion matter

404
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,333
filtering in
from the terminus.

405
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,458
Monitors are functioning
normally again.

406
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,542
Ferengi pod...

407
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,083
everybody in one piece
over there?

408
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,625
ARRIDOR:
Our condition

409
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,542
is no concern of yours,
<i>Enterprise</i> shuttle .

410
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,875
We are competitors in this
venture, not partners.

411
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:17,333
Ferengi pod, out.

412
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,208
Yeah, happy landings
to you, too.

413
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,500
Curious.
Hmm?

414
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:25,792
We are not where
we are supposed to be.

415
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:27,166
What do you mean?
We're on the other side

416
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,750
of the wormhole,
aren't we?

417
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:30,208
According to
the Barzan probe,

418
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,208
we should be in
the Gamma Quadrant.

419
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,000
But these readings
clearly indicate

420
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,792
we are nearly 200
light years away

421
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:38,083
in sector 3556

422
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,250
of the Delta Quadrant.

423
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,375
Maybe the Barzan readings
were wrong.

424
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,959
Perhaps their readings
were correct.

425
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,083
Their probe could have
exited the wormhole

426
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,250
at a completely different
location.

427
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:53,250
Hmm, Data,
my visor's

428
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,083
picking up subatomic
fluctuations.

429
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,792
Meson and lepton activity
is definitely increasing.

430
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:01,625
Gravitational acceleration
is also increasing.

431
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,500
Something<i> very</i> strange
is happening to this wormhole.

432
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,208
Sorry.

433
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,792
You're unusually limber
this morning.

434
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:31,792
I'll say.

435
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,917
Devinoni Ral.

436
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:39,667
It's ridiculous
and wonderful.

437
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:42,709
I feel completely
out of control.

438
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,166
Happy, terrified.

439
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:49,041
But there's nothing
rational about this.

440
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:51,750
Who needs rational
when your toes curl up?

441
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:01,041
I'm afraid
I'm going to lose myself.

442
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,041
I can't get enough
of him.

443
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,500
Is it possible to fall
in love in one day?

444
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:09,417
I did.

445
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,000
It was like this
for you and Jack?

446
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:14,208
No, it was
another fellow.

447
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,041
I fell in love
in a day.

448
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,250
It lasted a week,
but what a week.

449
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,333
Then I met Jack.

450
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,041
Oh, it took months
to figure it out with him.

451
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:30,166
Well, then maybe
I should slow down.

452
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:32,375
Catch my breath.

453
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:36,542
Not let this thing get out of
control.

454
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:39,583
BOTH:
Nah.

455
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:42,959
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

456
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,625
To be honest,
I was surprised

457
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:59,250
to see the Caldonians
here at all, Leyor.

458
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:02,417
You must think Caldonia
very insular, Mr. Ral.

459
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,250
Oh no, no, not at all.
Not at all.

460
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:07,166
On the contrary,
I've always respected

461
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,667
your world's commitment
to pure research.

462
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:11,959
It's just that...

463
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,792
well...

464
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,625
Go on, please.

465
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:21,417
Well, scholars don't always
enjoy administrative demands.

466
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:22,875
And certainly
we've seen here

467
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:24,125
that the administration

468
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:27,917
of the wormhole is--
Yes, I must admit,

469
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:31,417
I have begun to feel
some trepidation about that.

470
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,959
Yes.

471
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,417
Yes, I'm sure
you have, Leyor.

472
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,500
I'm sure we all have.

473
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:43,250
Do you realize that
in the next century,

474
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,917
the number of ships
that will pass...

475
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:47,333
Gentlemen, this open session
is called by request

476
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,667
of the Caldonia
delegation.

477
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:53,041
Madame Bhavani,

478
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:56,417
Caldonia withdraws
from these proceedings.

479
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,583
For what reasons,
Leyor?

480
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,917
It has been made very clear
that the maintenance

481
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,291
and administrative requirements

482
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,709
are beyond our abilities.

483
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,583
Leyor, the Federation
would like

484
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,250
to negotiate
a trade agreement

485
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,875
in which we could acquire
your planet's rich deposits

486
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:14,166
of Trillium 323,
which we would add to our bid,

487
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,709
Premier Bhavani.

488
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,125
My apologies.

489
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,709
We have already reached
an agreement

490
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,083
with the Chrysalians.

491
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,166
Mr. Ral...

492
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,166
you either had
very good instincts

493
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,917
or a foreknowledge
of the Caldonian withdrawal.

494
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:36,166
Well, some people just don't
like to transact business

495
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,583
with the Federation,
Commander.

496
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,625
The Chrysalians
hereby add

497
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:45,667
the Caldonian Trillium 323
to its bid, Premier.

498
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,917
I'm telling you,
it's changing.

499
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,625
I can see it
with my visor.

500
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,792
I have no intention
of leaving yet.

501
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:02,792
We have not finished taking
our readings.

502
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:03,959
Listen, Doctor,

503
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,208
your readings must
be telling you

504
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,500
the same things
we're getting.

505
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:08,667
This is not
the Gamma Quadrant.

506
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:11,500
I will not confirm
your speculations.

507
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,709
This is not
a speculation, Doctor.

508
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,875
We are not where the Barzans
said we should be,

509
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:19,041
which would indicate this side
of the wormhole is not stable.

510
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,917
There are meson
and lepton fluctuations.

511
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:24,583
Local gravitational fields
are increasing exponentially.

512
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,709
Everything says we better get
the hell out of here.

513
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,583
It will be visible again
in 40 seconds.

514
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:31,458
We will make
our own judgments then.

515
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,125
I can see it now
and I'm telling you,

516
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:36,250
you don't have time to wait,
not even 40 seconds.

517
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,750
Ferengi pod, out.

518
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:39,250
Damn it, Arridor!

519
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,041
We're 70,000
light years

520
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,000
away from our ships.
Come on now!

521
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:45,750
Follow us in.
We'll lead you.

522
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Idiots.

523
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,375
It's getting worse.

524
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:58,917
I'm taking us in, Data,
with or without them.

525
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,709
Thrusters at half power...

526
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,959
three-quarters...

527
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,750
Entering outer
event horizon.

528
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:13,667
They panic quickly
under pressure.

529
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:17,000
There...

530
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,458
precisely as scheduled,

531
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,875
right where
I expected it to be.

532
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,291
Everyone was talking today

533
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:37,333
about the way you absorbed
the Caldonian bid.

534
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,917
Well, the opening
was there.

535
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,625
I took it.

536
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:43,333
Commander Riker didn't know
how you managed it.

537
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,792
Let me tell you something
about Commander Riker.

538
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,291
He's good.

539
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,792
He's the most dangerous man
in that room to me.

540
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:55,375
But, he doesn't have
an edge...

541
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:56,667
your edge.

542
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:59,834
<i>Our</i> edge.

543
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:02,750
You make it sound
unethical.

544
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:05,250
Isn't it?

545
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,792
Deanna...
it's just business.

546
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,875
Why haven't you told anyone
you're an empath?

547
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,709
Because I find it makes
people uncomfortable.

548
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:26,500
I think you don't tell them
so you can gain an advantage.

549
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:31,625
Well I gained an advantage
by using it with you.

550
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:33,834
You didn't seem
to mind that.

551
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:42,583
Look, Deanna...

552
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:46,333
the point of negotiating
is to take advantage.

553
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,250
I don't know what the other side
is offering,

554
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,542
and they don't know
what I'm offering.

555
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:53,750
So we dance around each other
until somebody wins.

556
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:56,959
I never cry foul
when I lose.

557
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,041
But you're reading
their emotional states,

558
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,417
their inner selves,

559
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,542
and then using that
to manipulate them.

560
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:06,667
Well people have done that
for thousands of years,

561
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:08,792
just by listening
carefully,

562
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:11,000
by watching
body language.

563
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:13,333
I just happen
to be better at it.

564
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:15,166
You do it.

565
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:18,959
I do it to help my crew,
not outmaneuver them.

566
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:22,417
And I don't hide
that I'm an empath.

567
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:23,750
Oh, so you
announce it

568
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:27,083
to every alien culture
you encounter?

569
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:31,500
Or do you use it to give
your side an advantage?

570
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:33,542
Do you tell the Romulan
that's about to attack

571
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:36,166
that you sense that
he may be bluffing?

572
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:38,250
Or do you just tell it
to your captain?

573
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,417
That's different.

574
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,417
That's a matter
of protection.

575
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:51,875
Yes, protection.
Your protection,

576
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:57,250
your captain,
your crew, your edge.

577
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,250
Yes.

578
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,709
Now, it's a matter
of life and death

579
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,000
when you take
the advantage.

580
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:08,375
Me, I deal in property,
exchanges.

581
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:11,208
Nobody gets hurt.

582
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,166
So you tell me...

583
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,458
which one of us
would you say

584
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,333
has more of a problem
with ethics?

585
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,041
Excuse me.

586
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,834
May I join you,
Commander?

587
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,250
Bought out
the Ferengi yet, Ral?

588
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,792
Think I should
give it a try?

589
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,583
No, but I think that you will.
One way or another,

590
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:01,041
it's gonna come down
to you and me.

591
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,583
You know, you're very
good at this.

592
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,750
Very good.

593
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,166
Much better
than you realize.

594
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:07,333
Well, I hope I'm better
than<i> you</i> realize.

595
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,917
The last mile
of the marathon

596
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,667
is always
the toughest.

597
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:12,250
That's when the winners
are willing

598
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,250
to take the big risks.

599
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,417
You willing
to do that?

600
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,667
We'll see, won't we?

601
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:19,083
Well, let's see now.

602
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,583
I'm prepared to reach a firm
agreement with Bhavani

603
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,875
before we learn the outcome
of your probe's expedition.

604
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:27,417
Are you?

605
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,208
Oh, well, well, well.

606
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,000
That would not be
looked upon favorably

607
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:33,291
by the Federation,
I'd imagine.

608
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,500
You see, you have to
be willing

609
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:37,834
to take that
last step<i> alone,</i>

610
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,625
or it just isn't
worth playing.

611
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,041
Your point of view,
not mine.

612
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,583
Oh, I see that,
Commander, I see that.

613
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:47,166
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
<i>second</i> in command

614
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,417
of this starship.

615
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,875
You know, I feel

616
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:54,458
responsible for you
in a way... related.

617
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:59,041
Deanna.

618
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:01,583
We both love Deanna.

619
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,917
Oh, in different ways,
of course.

620
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:08,000
I will remove that burden
of responsibility right now.

621
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,583
My relationship with Deanna
stands very well on its own

622
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,834
without any help
from you.

623
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,417
Of course it does,
of course it does.

624
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:17,000
It's just that,
well...

625
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:19,583
she's a remarkable woman.

626
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:22,542
Brilliant, lovely...

627
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,458
very passionate.

628
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,709
And she could have
been yours, Will.

629
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,375
But you just didn't do enough
to keep her.

630
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:35,375
And now, well...

631
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:38,083
I'm here.

632
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,208
And I'm going
to take her, too.

633
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:47,125
That's the first bad play
I've seen you make.

634
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:50,125
If you can bring happiness
into Deanna's life,

635
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:53,083
nothing would
please me more.

636
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,875
You know you're not really
such a bad sort, Ral,

637
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:57,625
except you don't have
any values

638
00:35:57,667 --> 00:36:00,750
beyond the value
of today's bid, that is.

639
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:06,166
Deanna is just the woman
to bring some meaning

640
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,667
to your sorry existence,

641
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:10,417
if you're smart enough
to take it.

642
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,500
I doubt that you are.

643
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
To the last mile.

644
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,917
Sir, the Ferengi vessel
is moving

645
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:35,041
out of orbit--
impulse power.

646
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:39,000
They are approaching the entry
to the wormhole, sir.

647
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:42,250
Computer, is the Ferengi Goss
still on board the<i> Enterprise?</i>

648
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:45,333
DaiMon Goss departed
the<i> Enterprise</i> at 1400 hours.

649
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,166
They are powering forward
missile launchers, sir.

650
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,834
Yellow alert.
Hail the Ferengi.

651
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:54,667
Request an explanation of
your actions, DaiMon Goss.

652
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,834
I have learned
from informed sources

653
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,542
that the Federation
has manipulated

654
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,375
these negotiations from
the very beginning,

655
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:04,208
and has already signed a secret
agreement with the Barzans.

656
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,667
That is not true.

657
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:09,083
The Ferengi offer was
never seriously considered.

658
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:12,166
Premier Bhavani welcomed you
to these proceedings

659
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:14,041
despite my better judgment.

660
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,625
We will be ignored
no longer.

661
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:20,250
They've fired a missile
directly at the opening, sir.

662
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:22,333
Destroy it.
On screen.

663
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,417
Firing phasers.

664
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:32,500
Your offers both
have merit, gentlemen.

665
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,792
If I could find
a deciding factor--

666
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,291
(<i> alarm klaxon blaring</i> )

667
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,458
Riker to Picard.
What's happening, Captain?

668
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,917
Goss has fired a missile
at the wormhole.

669
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,458
I need you on the bridge,
Number One.

670
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,458
Excuse me.

671
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,917
Excuse me for saying so under
the circumstances, Premier,

672
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:53,375
but this fight
seems to really be

673
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:56,750
between the Federation
and the Ferengi.

674
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:59,709
Now, it seems unconscionable
that your wormhole

675
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,709
is being used as a pawn
in their power struggle.

676
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,542
You must know we will not
allow you to do this.

677
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:09,625
If the Ferengi cannot have
the wormhole, no one will.

678
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,542
A missile will have
no destructive effect

679
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,917
on a wormhole.

680
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,792
But if it should explode
near the shuttlecraft,

681
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,500
they will be destroyed.

682
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:18,750
Casualties of war,
Captain.

683
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:22,208
My men are prepared to die.
Are yours?

684
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,500
Captain, he's lying.

685
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:28,583
I'm almost sure of it.
He doesn't mean what he says.

686
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:31,000
Why? What is he
doing it for, then?

687
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,750
(<i> door whooshes open</i> )

688
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:36,625
Permission to enter
the bridge, Captain.

689
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,041
Premier, with all
due respect--

690
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,250
Captain, I believe I am
in a better position

691
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,959
to settle this with DaiMon Goss
than you are.

692
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,792
May I address him?

693
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,625
Premier?

694
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,291
DaiMon Goss?

695
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,542
This is Devinoni Ral.

696
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,709
I have nothing
to say to you, Ral.

697
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,208
Well,
then just listen.

698
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,667
The planet Barzan
has reached an agreement

699
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,458
with the Chrysalians

700
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,041
for long-term control
of the wormhole.

701
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,000
Now, on behalf
of the Chrysalians,

702
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:14,625
I am prepared to offer
the Ferengi

703
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:18,375
free access to the wormhole in
perpetuity.

704
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:19,917
I have your word
on this?

705
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:22,375
Yes, my word, sir.

706
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:24,625
In exchange for Ferengi
convoy privileges

707
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:27,375
to be negotiated
in good faith.

708
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:29,709
This is an acceptable offer.

709
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:34,709
The Ferengi vessel has shut down
its forward missile launcher.

710
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,875
Stand down red alert.

711
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,458
Commander Riker...

712
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,083
I'm sorry you
had to learn about

713
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,417
my decision this way.

714
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:45,959
You represented
the Federation well.

715
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,500
But I have come
to believe

716
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:49,917
that the Chrysalian's
tradition of peace

717
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:52,542
is more desirable
to my planet.

718
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,625
Excuse me, Premier.

719
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:57,542
There's something
you should know.

720
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:02,333
I'm sorry, was there
something you wanted to say?

721
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:04,291
No, not at all.

722
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,917
I have sensed you suddenly
felt uncomfortable.

723
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,250
Well, after all, it was
a very tense situation.

724
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,125
But that's what's so odd.

725
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:15,041
It wasn't tense at all.

726
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:16,792
In fact,
I sensed no tension

727
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,166
from you or Goss.

728
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,375
Wha-- I--
I was tense!

729
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,917
I was ready to blow it up!

730
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:24,000
Wha-- I strongly protest!

731
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,667
Screen off.

732
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:26,834
It was as though
you were

733
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:29,417
performing a scene
for all of us.

734
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:31,792
Pardon me, Captain, I--

735
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:34,125
I believe there's a slight
conflict of interest here.

736
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:36,625
I agree entirely.

737
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,041
Mr. Ral asked me
not to tell anyone

738
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,834
he has empathic
powers,

739
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,542
which he uses to manipulate
his competitors

740
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:47,125
in a negotiation.
And, yes,

741
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:49,834
it did put me in
a conflict of interest,

742
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:52,208
which I hope
I have now resolved.

743
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,166
Premier, I believe Ral

744
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:57,583
has used your fear
of continuing aggression

745
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:00,000
between the Federation
and its enemies

746
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,083
to undermine
our position.

747
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:05,500
I also believe that
this incident

748
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:09,000
was staged by Ral and Goss
to provide you a reason

749
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:12,000
to choose in favor
of the Chrysalians.

750
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,542
Captain, it's
the shuttlecraft,

751
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,041
they're coming
back through.

752
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,208
GEORDI:
Shuttle Nine to<i> Enterprise.</i>

753
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,959
On screen.

754
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:27,875
This is shuttle Nine
reporting in.

755
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,250
Barely.

756
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,250
PICARD:
And the Ferengi pod, Commander?

757
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,500
Trapped on
the other side, sir.

758
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:36,041
In Delta Quadrant.
We tried to warn them.

759
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,583
They wouldn't follow us.

760
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,125
Elaborate.

761
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:43,125
Captain, this end of the
wormhole is currently stable,

762
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,667
but the other end apparently
shifts positions periodically.

763
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:49,333
The Barzan probe had no way
to recognize this.

764
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:52,875
Eventually, both sides
will be unstable.

765
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:55,583
GEORDI: It's a dry well,
Captain-- worthless.

766
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,709
Acknowledged, shuttle.

767
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,750
Main shuttle bay,
prepare for final approach.

768
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:02,125
MAN:
Aye, sir.

769
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,875
WORF: Captain, DaiMon Goss
is demanding

770
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:07,583
to know where
his men are.

771
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,458
Advise him to set
his coordinates

772
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,792
for the Delta Quadrant.

773
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:15,333
He may run into them
in 80 years or so.

774
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:19,750
Mr. Ral...

775
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:21,542
congratulations on winning
the rights

776
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,625
to the Barzan wormhole.

777
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:26,500
I take the risks,
Mr. Riker.

778
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:29,834
And I stand by
my agreements.

779
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,417
Come in.

780
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,041
When do you leave?

781
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,583
Soon.

782
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:49,000
I've been recalled
by the Chrysalians.

783
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:51,083
Explanations demanded,
and so forth.

784
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:52,625
I'm sorry.

785
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,834
Well, I've done well
for them over the years.

786
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,959
They understand the stakes.

787
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,417
It'll be fine.

788
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:03,083
I had to do it, Troi.

789
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,875
Bhavani was ready to go
with the Federation.

790
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,291
I sensed it.

791
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:10,667
I'd used up every card
in the deck.

792
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:12,458
I needed to change
the rules.

793
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,083
You must have known
I couldn't

794
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,875
allow you to do that.

795
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:19,125
My human physical response

796
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:23,291
must have been blocking
my Betazoid senses.

797
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:29,166
I'm very grateful for
what you did, in a way.

798
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:33,542
It's made me take
a hard look at who I am.

799
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,667
I don't like what I see.

800
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,250
I once asked you
to run away with me.

801
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:44,333
Now I'm asking again.

802
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:49,375
I need you.

803
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:51,458
You could help me change.
You could--

804
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,625
You could be
my conscience.

805
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:10,333
I already have a job
as Counselor.
