1
00:00:02,542 --> 00:00:06,208
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42859.2.</i>

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,041
<i>We are in orbit</i>
<i>around Antede 3</i>

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:10,417
<i>awaiting the arrival</i>
<i>of two dignitaries.</i>

4
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:11,750
<i>Our mission is</i>
<i>to escort them</i>

5
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:14,000
<i>to a conference</i>
<i>on planet Pacifica</i>

6
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,959
<i>where they will be given</i>
<i>the opportunity</i>

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
<i>to join the Federation.</i>

8
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,500
I thought you might find
this interesting, Mr. Crusher.

9
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:27,583
Few humans have seen
an Antedian in the flesh.

10
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,041
Welcome.

11
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,417
I'm Jean-Luc Picard

12
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,625
captain of
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

13
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,375
Are they
all right, sir?

14
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,542
Yes.

15
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,166
This is their
preferred way

16
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,709
of space travel.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,375
PULASKI:
Their physical condition
is good enough,

18
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:00,166
considering
the circumstances.

19
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:03,625
It is a self-induced
catatonic state--

20
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,208
their way of dealing

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,500
with the trauma
of spaceflight.

22
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:09,542
Will we try
to revive them?

23
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,250
No. Not until we reach
the Pacifica conference

24
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,792
three days
from now.

25
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:15,834
Doctor, have you prepared
a sick bay facility

26
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,583
to accommodate
our guests?

27
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,583
Well as soon as I can make
some adjustments.

28
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,208
Their physiology
is unusual.

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,208
You can store them
for a few hours?

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,333
Sure, I'll have them
kept here out of the way.

31
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,792
Mr. Worf,
provide security.

32
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:30,000
WORF:
Aye, sir.

33
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:33,166
What's in that
container?

34
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,917
Vermicula.

35
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,458
It's their food.

36
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,125
When they come out of stasis,
they'll be very hungry.

37
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,375
They eat this?

38
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,583
In great quantities.

39
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,375
What a handsome race.

40
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:04,125
So what did you think
of the Antedians, Wesley?

41
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,750
They are... rather
strange looking, Commander.

42
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,750
Judging a being by its
physical appearance

43
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,750
is the last major
human prejudice, Wesley.

44
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,750
Point is well taken,
Mr. Data.

45
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:16,041
I'm sure that
to the Antedians,

46
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,834
we are equally
unattractive.

47
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,458
Captain,
we are being hailed

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
by a small transport vessel,
just coming into range.

49
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,875
Oh, my God.

50
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,750
What's the problem?

51
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,333
What's<i> she</i> doing here?

52
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,583
WESLEY:
On screen, Captain.

53
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,208
<i>Starship Enterprise,</i>
come in.

54
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,000
RIKER:
We have you on viewer, pilot.

55
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,917
<i>Enterprise,</i>
I have a passenger.

56
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,709
A V.I.P. passenger
who I--

57
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,125
Oh, let me talk
to them.

58
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,375
I'm sure I'm more
articulate than that.

59
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:43,625
Mother.

60
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,291
DATA:
Captain,
we are receiving

61
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,583
Starfleet orders
granting a Lwaxana...

62
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,083
Lwaxana Troi!

63
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,500
A daughter of
the Fifth House,

64
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,959
holder of the
Sacred Chalice of Riix,

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,750
heir to the Holy Rings
of Betazed.

66
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,917
...full ambassadorial
status, sir.

67
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,250
It looks like it's back
into that dress uniform, sir.

68
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,834
And yours as well,
Commander.

69
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,250
She is listed
as representing

70
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,500
the Betazed government
at the conference.

71
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:08,166
Mother, please,
don't do this to me.

72
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,625
LWAXANA:
Do what to you,
little one?

73
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:13,125
Oh! Jean-Luc,

74
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,709
what naughty
thoughts.

75
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,917
But how wonderful you still
think of me like that.

76
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:46,500
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

77
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:50,834
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship Enterprise.</i>

78
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,375
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

79
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:56,458
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

80
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,000
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

81
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:05,166
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

82
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,458
It's so like my mother
to do the unexpected.

83
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,291
Well, it will
be... pleasant

84
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,750
to have her as a guest
of the<i> Enterprise</i> again.

85
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,333
Energize.

86
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,709
Legs!
Where are the legs?

87
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,500
Where they belong, Mother,
right under you.

88
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,458
Oh, I hate that.

89
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,875
I will never completely trust
this device, Jean-Luc.

90
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,125
<i>Captain Picard,</i> Mother.

91
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,583
(<i> startled cry</i> )

92
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,959
Explain to her.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry they startled
you Mrs. Troi.

94
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,375
They're Antedian
delegates.

95
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,917
They're being stored
here temporarily.

96
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,583
Delegates?

97
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,083
Last time I saw
something like that,

98
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,709
it was being served
on a plate.

99
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,667
Darling.

100
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,667
Ah.

101
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:02,250
LWAXANA:
Well, well, well.

102
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,583
And<i> you</i> Jean-Luc,

103
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,709
I wasn't aware you had
such handsome legs.

104
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,417
My valet is waiting.

105
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,583
You may beam him
aboard now.

106
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,959
You remember Mr. Homn,
of course.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,875
It would be hard
to forget Mr. Homn.

108
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:22,583
I've retained
his services despite

109
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,125
the outlandishly
lustful thoughts

110
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,000
he spews
in my direction.

111
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,667
You can put
that down, Homn.

112
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:29,750
We can't deny the captain
the honor

113
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:32,542
of carrying
my belongings.

114
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,959
I will not interfere with
Mr. Homn's duties this time.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,250
Oh, now,
that's not what

116
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,166
you're really thinking,
Jean-Luc.

117
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,583
You forget,
I'm a telepath.

118
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,667
Mrs. Troi, since this
is obviously

119
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,875
significant to you...

120
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,375
I'll--

121
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,542
I'll carry it.

122
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,375
Just down this corridor.

123
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,917
LWAXANA:<i> </i>
<i>He has nice legs too,</i>
<i>little one.</i>

124
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,792
<i>Is he still yours?</i>

125
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,709
<i>Humans no longer own</i>
<i>each other that way, Mother.</i>

126
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,291
Really?

127
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:23,166
That's a custom we may
have to introduce again.

128
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,291
Thank you.

129
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,250
Glad to help.

130
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,333
Well, I trust you will
be comfortable here.

131
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,667
If you will
excuse me...

132
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,917
Uh, I am serving
a Betazoid

133
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,709
dinner of greeting
tonight, Captain.

134
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,375
It is an ambassadorial
function.

135
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,458
It sounds delightful.

136
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,083
He's a fine man.

137
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,500
Solid, he's reliable.

138
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,291
He's a little bit
on the stuffy side

139
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,000
but, uh, all in all,
he's not that bad.

140
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,417
I can't believe you,
Mother.

141
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,250
You sound like you're
sizing up a commodity.

142
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,041
But that's exactly
what men are,

143
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,792
darling,
especially human men.

144
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,000
Was your father ever
unhappy with me?

145
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,625
No.

146
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,291
He worshipped you.

147
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,000
But I don't think
I'll ever learn

148
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,667
to see men
the way you do.

149
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:28,625
You will as
you mature, darling.

150
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,792
And the men in your life
are going to bless you for it.

151
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,208
You're so beautiful.

152
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,125
And she actually complimented
Captain Picard on his legs?

153
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,291
I would have
thought a telepath

154
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,083
would be more
discreet, sir.

155
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,834
RIKER:
Exactly the opposite.
She knows what's on your mind

156
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,917
and she lets you know
what's on hers.

157
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,625
(laughing)
PICARD: Gentlemen...

158
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,959
I think we must not
lose sight of the fact

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,500
that we are talking
about someone

160
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,166
who has been granted
ambassadorial rank,

161
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,625
even though
she may appear...

162
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,333
somewhat eccentric.

163
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,291
Lwaxana Troi must
be treated with

164
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,417
the appropriate respect.
Is that understood?

165
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,834
Picard to Pulaski.
Yes, Captain?

166
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,375
When did you last look in
on the Antedian guests?

167
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,333
Doing so right now,
Captain.

168
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,333
Are they still catatonic?

169
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,500
Status of the beings
is unchanged.

170
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,500
Pulse, still steady.

171
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:37,166
Respiration...
normal for them.

172
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,208
Understood.
Keep me informed.

173
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,375
Picard out.

174
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,583
I'll be
in my quarters.

175
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:46,166
It will be a dress uniform
dinner, gentlemen.

176
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,542
Sir?

177
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,166
To which dinner was
the captain referring, sir?

178
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,208
Nothing I've been invited to.
Any of you?

179
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:06,583
Very interesting.

180
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,291
Doctor?

181
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,542
You're not attending
the dinner

182
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,250
with the rest
of us this evening?

183
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,041
I've already eaten,
but thanks, Captain.

184
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,875
I seem to be
a little early.

185
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,208
I'm sure the others
will be here soon.

186
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,333
The other officers--

187
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,375
Commander Riker,
Counselor Troi?

188
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,000
Hello, Jean-Luc.

189
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:57,458
So glad you could come.

190
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,000
A toast,
to Earth men

191
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,208
who, despite their
many faults,

192
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,458
have that
unique ability

193
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,875
to charm women
of all races

194
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:20,709
in all corners
of the galaxy.

195
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,917
Speaking on behalf
of men of Earth,

196
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,083
which is indeed
an awesome responsibility,

197
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,000
I thank you.

198
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,667
I know what you're
thinking, Captain.

199
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,375
You do?

200
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:44,709
You're wondering
whether I'm seeing

201
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,458
any other man...
on a serious basis.

202
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Well, actually,
I wasn't, uh--

203
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,083
Ah, I wouldn't worry
about it, Jean-Luc.

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,500
Competition seems
to bring out

205
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,291
the best in
the human male.

206
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:09,000
The fact is,
I, um... uh...

207
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,083
I was not expecting
this, uh, this setting.

208
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,458
I had assumed that
my senior bridge officers

209
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,000
would be attending.

210
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,291
You never assume
anything

211
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,875
where Lwaxana Troi
is concerned.

212
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:23,458
Betazoid women are
full of surprises.

213
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,500
Ah, strange.

214
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,750
I'm not really
very hungry tonight.

215
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,792
I wonder what's made me
lose my appetite.

216
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:42,166
Any ideas?

217
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,750
(<i> gong chiming</i> )

218
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,667
Of course. You're giving
thanks for your food.

219
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:50,875
I had forgotten
about that.

220
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,834
I wonder how many other
cultures have similar customs.

221
00:13:58,417 --> 00:13:59,875
Uh, I don't know.

222
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,083
Well, let's find out.

223
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,709
Commander Data?
Yes, Captain.

224
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,417
Mrs. Troi and I are having
a very interesting discussion

225
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:14,750
about various societies'
ways of giving thanks.

226
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,917
The Betazoids' use of
the chime, for instance.

227
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,834
The use of the chime
is quite unique,

228
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,583
but not at all
dissimilar

229
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,417
to the Ooolans
of Marejaretus 6,

230
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,083
who use two large stones
which are continuously

231
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,834
struck together during
the meal.

232
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,583
Those at the dinner must eat
until the stones are broken.

233
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,500
Or the oligarchy
at Atifs 4,

234
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:33,625
which requires a young--

235
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,375
Data,
this is fascinating.

236
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,542
Don't you agree,
Mrs. Troi?

237
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,250
Commander, if your
duties permit,

238
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,625
why don't you
join us for dessert?

239
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,583
I'm sure that Mrs. Troi
would much appreciate

240
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,625
the pleasure of your company.
What?

241
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,000
Indeed, sir.
I'm on my way.

242
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,250
Data out.

243
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,834
How could you
possibly think

244
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,125
I would want to share
our special time together

245
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,917
with that-- that--
that robot of yours?

246
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,000
Because of Data's wonderful
after-dinner conversation.

247
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,667
His anecdotes are the stuff
of legends aboard this ship.

248
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,417
So, by using
the square root of pi

249
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,583
and multiplying it by
nine to the third power,

250
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,709
I was able to
accurately calculate

251
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,667
the distance between
the Omicron system

252
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:17,834
and the Crab Nebula.

253
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:22,125
Oh! Ah.
Fascinating, Data.

254
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,542
Absolutely fascinating.

255
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,917
I'm sure Mrs. Troi

256
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,250
would<i> love</i> to hear
the one about

257
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,917
the anomalous chemical
composition of,

258
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,208
um, brown
dwarf stars.

259
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,166
Not really.
Yes, Captain...

260
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,291
that is a particularly
spellbinding subject.

261
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,959
In most stars,

262
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the rare-earth
element europium

263
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,834
is enriched relative to
samarium and gadolinium.

264
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,625
That so?
It is. However--

265
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:55,542
Your mother seems quite
an interesting woman, Deanna.

266
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,041
Hmm, perhaps I should
tell you something

267
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,250
about my mother's
condition at this time.

268
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,083
<i>"Condition</i>
at this time"?

269
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,291
It's something that occurs
to Betazed females

270
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,417
as they enter mid-life.

271
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,375
We call it "the phase."

272
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:12,417
Mid-life, as in a human
female's menopause?

273
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,583
Similar.
It's only at mid-life

274
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,834
that a Betazoid
female becomes...

275
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,125
well, fully sexual,
if you know what I mean.

276
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,583
Yes, I think I do.

277
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,208
I also think
that I saw the captain

278
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,458
on his way
to her quarters.

279
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,792
I wonder if
I shouldn't warn him?

280
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:32,333
No.
As ship's doctor,

281
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,375
I consider it an
excellent exercise

282
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:37,458
for his reflexes
and agility.

283
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,041
Doctor!

284
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,917
For staying ahead
of your mother.

285
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,417
Yes.

286
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,125
An animal is always
at its best when hunted.

287
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,041
Or, when hunting.

288
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,000
... and at this point,
the second coorbital satellite

289
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,166
avoids a collision
with the first--

290
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:59,667
Deanna, darling, thank
the four deities you're here.

291
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,250
I hope I'm not
interrupting.

292
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,875
No, I must, as
a matter of fact,

293
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:05,375
be getting back
to the bridge.

294
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,166
DATA:
Captain...

295
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,792
perhaps I should remain
and further entertain our guest.

296
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:11,333
No!
I-- I mean,

297
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,625
I'm sure you're needed on
the bridge as well.

298
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,959
Well, thank you
for, um...

299
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,667
a delicious meal.

300
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,083
We must do this
again sometime.

301
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,625
I<i> know</i> we will.

302
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,083
Well, little one...

303
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,542
the captain is every bit
as charming as your father was.

304
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,542
(<i> gong chiming</i> )

305
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,375
Mmm.

306
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:49,041
(<i> gong chiming)</i>

307
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,291
(<i> sighing</i> )

308
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,500
Data, you will never know

309
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:01,542
how much I owe
you for that.

310
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,083
Indeed, Captain?

311
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,333
I know many more
interesting anecdotes, sir.

312
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,959
For example--
Data.

313
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,500
Sir?
Later.

314
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:10,417
Yes, sir.

315
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,417
Why would you come aboard
at a time like this?

316
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,583
Well I had no choice.

317
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,792
<i>I</i> was going to Pacifica,

318
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,208
<i>you</i> were going
to Pacifica.

319
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,375
Don't be absurd,
Mother.

320
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,583
You<i> knew</i> what
would happen.

321
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,709
What stage is it in?

322
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,834
Oh, I have it completely
under control.

323
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,333
What stage is it in?

324
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,500
Well, far enough along

325
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,709
for me to enjoy it,
little one.

326
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,500
Now I know why you
wore that dress.

327
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,125
Wha--
Don't be ridiculous.

328
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,917
This simple
little dress?

329
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,542
Nothing provocative
about it.

330
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:48,709
What are we going to do?

331
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,000
Well I'm going to do
the only

332
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,750
honorable thing
there is to do.

333
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:54,625
And I'd say your captain
has the inside track.

334
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,959
Mother, don't even
think it.

335
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,208
Why not?
He was thinking about it

336
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,583
all through dinner.

337
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:05,750
I was what?

338
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,834
I tell you,
Deanna...

339
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,041
for a telepath,
your mother's accuracy

340
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,166
leaves much
to be desired.

341
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,333
Actually, her
telepathic prowess

342
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:26,333
is quite advanced...
except for now.

343
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,875
"Except for now"?

344
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,041
Don't misunderstand me,
Counselor.

345
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,792
Your mother is
a beautiful person.

346
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:37,125
My mother is beginning
a physiological phase.

347
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,583
It's one that all Betazoid
women must deal with

348
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,250
as they enter
mid-life.

349
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,041
RIKER:
Yes it's something
Troi warned me about

350
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,125
when we first started
to see each other.

351
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,333
A Betazoid woman, when
she goes through this phase...

352
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,083
quadruples
her sex drive.

353
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,083
Or more.
Or more?

354
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,458
You never
told me that.

355
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,583
I didn't want
to frighten you.

356
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,333
She has opted for

357
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,458
the only dignified
option open to her.

358
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,458
Isolation?

359
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,417
She has decided to focus
all her sexual energy

360
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,542
on one male
who will, of course,

361
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,417
eventually become
her husband.

362
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,500
It seems,
Captain, that...

363
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,750
you are the early
favorite.

364
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,667
Congratulations,
sir.

365
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,709
I'm not amused,
Number One.

366
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,667
There must be some way

367
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:35,041
to convince her
that it's...

368
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:39,917
quite impossible...
without offending her.

369
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:43,250
You cannot apply human-style
logic to this, Captain.

370
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,166
A Betazoid woman
in the phase

371
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,041
would be shocked
and deeply resentful

372
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,000
should you spurn
any such advances.

373
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,000
She would take it
personally.

374
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,000
Well, under
the circumstances,

375
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,250
I think it would
be prudent

376
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,291
if I were
to make myself...

377
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:06,000
less available for
the duration of the journey.

378
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,083
Agreed.

The year-- 1941 A.D.

00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,041

00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,875
Hi, Dix.

386
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,792
Madeline.

387
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,667
Good to see you again.

388
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:13,291
You're too much,
Dix.

389
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,291
You make it sound like
you ain't seen me in a year.

390
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,333
(<i> chuckling</i> )

391
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,542
You got two calls.
They're on your desk.

392
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,041
New cases?
Are you kidding?

393
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,500
The last time
we had a new case,

394
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,709
Hitler and Stalin
were bosom buddies.

395
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,125
The landlord came by.

396
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,125
He wants the geetus,
or he wants you out.

397
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,333
The geetus?

398
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,000
The moolah, Dix,
the rent.

399
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,417
And since we're
on the subject,

400
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,166
it's been a month
since I seen anything.

401
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,417
Now, I know
it's been tough

402
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,667
since you got out
of the hospital,

403
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:41,834
but I got
responsibilities.

404
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:46,291
Then, I suppose
I had better get a case.

405
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,000
It wouldn't hurt!

406
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:19,417

00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,083
Unavailable?
Ship's business?

408
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,583
You mean ship's business
takes precedence over me?

409
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,333
I'm afraid so,
Mother.

410
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:58,041
Oh.
Well...

411
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,458
he was too old
for me, anyway.

412
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,792
Homn!

413
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,875
Perhaps we should consider
my alternate plan.

414
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:09,417
DEANNA:
Alternate plan?

415
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,542
Oh, you worry too much,
little one.

416
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,083
Your mother has the
situation well in hand.

417
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,458
There's a gentleman here
to see you, Mr. Hill.

418
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,083
And he doesn't look
like a client.

419
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:32,792
Hill, the name
is Slade Bender.

420
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:34,667
Excuse me.

421
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,041
(<i> turns off music</i> )

422
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,375
what can I do for you,
Mr. Bender?

423
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:43,333
It's about Alva.

424
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:47,583
You'll have to be
a little more precise.

425
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,166
Okay, you want
to play stupid.

426
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,917
That's jake with me.

427
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,667
A week ago,
a man came in here.

428
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:55,417
He wanted you to find
his girlfriend, name's Alva.

429
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:56,917
Did I find her?

430
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:59,542
You know, you're getting
on my nerves.

431
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,792
You found her, all right,
face down in the river.

432
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,417
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

433
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,750
Yeah, yeah, we're all
broken up about it.

434
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:09,250
Especially the boyfriend,

435
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,000
who has been indicted
for murder.

436
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,625
And, what are
you here to do,

437
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:14,875
ask for a refund?

438
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:17,333
Nah, I'm here
to kill you.

439
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,417
Computer,
freeze program!

440
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,208
Computer, this isn't
what I wanted at all.

441
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,750
(<i> sighing</i> ) 
It's much too violent.

442
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:34,083
I'm here to relax,
not to dodge bullets.

443
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,875
Reconfigure.

Please define.

445
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:41,959
Um, more... ambience.

446
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,208
Less substance.

447
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,000
Do you wish to leave
the holodeck and reenter,

448
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,959
or continue
from this point?

449
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,417
No, I will continue.

450
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:54,625
Program complete.
You may continue.

451
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:59,583
MADELINE:
There's a gentleman
here to see you, Mr. Hill.

452
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,500
Thank you, Madeline.

453
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,750
You a private dick?

454
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:20,959
That's what it
says on my door.

455
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,625
Is that supposed
to be funny?

456
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,709
Because if it is...

457
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,959
you got
to know that...

458
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,166
I ain't in the mood
for funny.

459
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:46,542
Now I came here
on serious business.

460
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,709
There's a job I want you
to do for me.

461
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,750
Computer,
freeze program.

462
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:54,166
Clear!

463
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:59,125
Computer, this
still isn't right.

464
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:02,166
One kind of violence has
been substituted for another.

465
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,625
Reconfigure.

466
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:07,000
You may continue.
Thank you.

467
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:09,208
You're through ducking me,
Hill!

468
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,000
Computer,
freeze program!

469
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,875
Variations
on a theme.

470
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:22,166
Computer,
perhaps I am not

471
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:25,041
clearly defining
my intent.

472
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,458
The flexibility of the program
is limited

473
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,333
to the parameters
of the Dixon Hill novels.

474
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:35,417
Yes, of course.

475
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:39,834
Even in this state,

476
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:44,000
they possess
a certain dignity.

477
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:47,250
A graceful countenance.

478
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,291
If you say so,
Lieutenant.

479
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,250
I see.

480
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,667
Is this how you felt
when you first saw me?

481
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:01,458
Well, maybe at first,
a little.

482
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,875
But now that I've seen
more Klingons,

483
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,125
I've come
to think you're--

484
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,333
you're handsome,
for a Klingon.

485
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,250
That didn't quite come out
the way I meant, sir.

486
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,750
(<i> gasping</i> )

487
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:22,000
LWAXANA:
I still say they'd look
better in sauce.

488
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,166
When will the good
captain revive them?

489
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,667
Not until we reach
Pacifica, ma'am.

490
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:27,458
Oh.

491
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:32,333
You seem
a fine boy.

492
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:35,208
One day you'll grow up
to be a big, strong man.

493
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,917
But, I'm afraid I cannot afford
to wait for you to mature.

494
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,083
Now that's
more like it.

495
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,667
Your thoughts,
they're primal, savage...

496
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:46,667
I like that in a man.

497
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:48,333
I am not a man.

498
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,041
Oh, which is
in your favor,

499
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,959
men so often being
irrational and egotistical.

500
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,667
But,
unfortunately,

501
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:57,291
I've grown accustomed
to human companionship.

502
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,667
Pity.

503
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,750
You'd have made
a fine choice.

504
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:08,291
Well, who is next,
Mr. Homn?

505
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,458
Ah, yes.
Well, let's to it.

506
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,583
I'm not getting
any younger.

507
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,500
What was that
all about?

508
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,917
So, Madeline,
I'll see you later.

509
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,333
Activate program.

510
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,417
Leaving, Dix?
Uh-huh.

511
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,375
You're not going
to Rex's bar, are you?

512
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:46,625
Rex's bar.
Why do you ask?

513
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,500
It's one of the messages
I left on your desk.

514
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,625
Well, that sounds like
an excellent idea.

515
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,750
Would you care
to join me?

516
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:58,792

Why not?

518

There ain't no
"why not" about it.

519
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:04,583
It's just that this is
the first time you ever asked.

520
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,417
Is that a problem?

521
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,083
Not for me.

522
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,125
But you better
take this.

523
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,875
Why?

524
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,875
Because if we're
going to Rex's bar,

525
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,917
you're gonna
need it.

526

(<i> conversational chatter,</i>
<i>laughter )</i>

527
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,834
Hey, Dix, what do you know
and what do you say?

528
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,208
See this?

529
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,166
Germany's getting ready
to invade England.

530
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,834
Who's gonna stop 'em?
Somebody better.

531
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,583
As long as it isn't us.

532
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,250
The last thing America
needs to do

533
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,500
is fight in another
world war.

534
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,208
Actually, the second world war,
although disastrous,

535
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,834
did end with the United States
taking its place

536
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,166
as a dominant world power
and cultural influence

537
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,125
in the second half of
the 20th century.

538
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,875
Additionally,
that war was a catalyst

539
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,834
of technological
advancement.

540
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,834
Developments in rocketry
and fission

541
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:38,917
resonate on into
the 24th century.

542
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:41,709
I don't know if I should
pour you one, Dix.

543
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,041
Sounds like you got
a snootful already.

544
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:47,333
What's this?
The usual.

545
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,625
Uh-huh. Ah, yes,
now let me see.

546
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:51,000
That would be, uh,
scotch, neat.

547
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,333
What else?

548
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,417
And for the lady?

549
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,917
Rye and ginger.

550
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,458
Money.

551
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,959
I keep forgetting
the need to carry money.

552
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,709
I must remember not to let
this happen again.

553
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,500
Right, I don't mind you
being on the cuff,

554
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:37,834
but you're up the sleeve
halfway to my collar.

555
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,667
Is that why you wanted
to see me, about my bar bill?

556
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:44,583
No, it's on account
of... Jimmy Cuzzo.

557
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:48,250
Jimmy Cuzzo--
I know that name.

558
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:51,333
He's why I gave you
the gun.

559
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:55,959
What was the name of
that case he was involved in?

560
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,125
<i>The Parrot's Claw.</i>

561
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,709
MADELINE:
Geez, Dix.

562
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,458
Cuzzo is the guy who
iced Marty O'farron.

563
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,583
They never would've nailed him
if it hadn't been for you.

564
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,959
Your testimony
got him "arranged."

565
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,834
Yeah.
Yours and mine.

566
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,333
So you brought me here

567
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:16,458
because<i> you</i> didn't want
to face him alone.

568
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,625
I don't want
to face him at all.

569
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,583
I'm hoping that
seeing us together

570
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,291
will slow him up
long enough

571
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,208
to get some things
straight.

572
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,917
And if it doesn't?

573
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:28,166
Then you just have
to kill him.

574
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,917
Bridge, this is
Dr. Pulaski.

575
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,458
We've just completed
the transfer.

576
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,625
The Antedians
are now in sick bay.

577
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,583
Acknowledged,
Doctor.

578
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,083
Mother, what are you
doing here?

579
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,875
You can't just
stroll onto the bridge

580
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:50,375
whenever you feel
like it.

581
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:52,000
I didn't just
stroll on, dear.

582
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:54,750
I took that "turbotube,"
or whatever you call it.

583
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,959
Uh, the captain's
not here?

584
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,083
Um, he is busy
elsewhere, ma'am.

585
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,041
Oh, well...

586
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,375
I have other
interests as well.

587
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,542
<i>You're scheming</i>
<i>something, Mother.</i>

588
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:09,000
<i>Don't try to fool me,</i>
<i>I can tell.</i>

589
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:10,959
<i>You're always so</i>
<i>melodramatic, little one.</i>

590
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,625
<i>I'm not scheming,</i>
<i>I'm deciding.</i>

591
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,166
<i>Mother, not him.</i>

592
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:22,041
<i>And why not him?</i>

593
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,625
<i>He's adorable.</i>

594
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,542
Pulaski to bridge.
Riker here.

595
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,875
The Antedians
are coming around.

596
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:42,083
They are currently in the early
stages of posthibernation.

597
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,125
How long until
they're fully conscious?

598
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,875
I guess it to be
a matter of hours now.

599
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:48,417
Very well, I'll
inform the captain.

600
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,375
If you'll
excuse me, ma'am.

601
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,417
You're going
to see the captain?

602
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,417
But I thought he was tied up
on ship's business.

603
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:56,834
In a manner
of speaking, he is.

604
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,083
I'm not going to be
disturbing him.

605
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,000
I'll just give him
the message.

606
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:03,166
Oh.
Excellent timing.

607
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,417
Then you may also
inform him about us.

608
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:07,208
<i>Us</i> ?
You don't mind

609
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,041
if I let our ship's crew
know first, do you, William?

610
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:13,041
Uh, friends,
dear friends...

611
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,542
You are all invited

612
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:17,917
to a prestigious occasion
on the planet Pacifica.

613
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:20,166
No.
There...

614
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:23,458
on the shores
of the western sea,

615
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,041
in a traditional
Betazoid ceremony,

616
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,041
your Commander Riker
and I will be joined

617
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:33,333
in the union
of matrimony.

618
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,333
Married?

619
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:40,125
Until death
us do part.

620
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:53,375
Mrs. Troi, I don't know
how to tell you this--

621
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,041
Oh, I know how
you feel, dear.

622
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:57,250
You're overwhelmed
with excitement.

623
00:35:57,291 --> 00:36:00,542
Oh, believe me,
I understand.

624
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,041
We'll talk about
the details later.

625
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:04,875
Right now, there are
preparations to be made.

626
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,959
Why did you stop me?

627
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,333
Somebody needs
to set her straight.

628
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,125
I think I'll leave that
to the Captain.

629
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,333
Coward.

630
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,166
Commander...

631
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,458
are you planning
on going into the holodeck?

632
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,583
I thought I might.
Would you like to join me?

633
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:25,333
Could you postpone our departure
for just five minutes, sir?

634
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:29,667
No problem.

635
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,625
You said you had
responsibilities.

636
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:37,500
What exactly
did you mean?

637
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,834
You know about
my mother's cousin.

638
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:42,458
The girl from San Antonio
I told you about?

639
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,750
(<i> gasping</i> )
Jimmy.

640
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:55,583
(<i> sighing</i> )
I'm as jumpy
as Haircut Lapinski

641
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,166
trying to land
on a fraction.

642
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,000
Sorry to bother you,
Captain.

643
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,792
Captain?
Call me Dix.

644
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,166
Sorry to bother you,
Dix,

645
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:04,166
But our two passengers
have awakened.

646
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,959
Oh, then it's time
for me to go.

647
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,667
What about Jimmy Cuzzo?

648
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:10,000
You can't leave Rex
to face him alone.

649
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,291
I'll be back before
Jimmy Cuzzo arrives.

650
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,083
I guarantee,
it will be taken care of.

651
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,583
Just relax.
Your friends have time

652
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,959
for one drink,
haven't they, Dix?

653
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,750
Oh, yes, of course.
One more round.

654
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,041
These are
my associates.

655
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,625
This is, uh, "Nails,"
from Chicago,

656
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,959
and this is, uh...
Carlos.

657
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,291
From South America.

658
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,166
This is Madeline,
my secretary.

659
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:38,417
And I want you
to meet Rex...

660
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,542
you know, I don't think
I ever heard your last name.

661
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,625
Hmm. Don't think
I have one.

662
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:44,166
Just Rex,
that's all.

663
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,834
So fellas, tell me
your troubles.

664
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:47,959
Well troubles,
we've got some, Captain.

665
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,083
It seems that a certain woman,
both wealthy and beautiful,

666
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:52,542
now thinks that she is
going to marry<i> me.</i>

667
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,792
REX:
She's got looks
and bucks?

668
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:58,667
Sounds like you've got
yourself one heck of a deal.

669
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,834
Oh, my fiance just has
to see how I look in this.

670
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,917
Come along, Homn.

671
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,792
Hello, uh...
computer?

672
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:20,417
Is Commander Riker
still on the bridge?

673
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:23,917
Negative. Riker is currently
in Holodeck 3.

674
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:27,458
Uh, um, holodeck?
Uh, where is that?

675
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,417
Follow the com-panel lights.
They will lead you there.

676
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,834
Com--
Oh. Oh!

677
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,792
Oh!

678
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,375
Good God, what's that?

679
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:52,375
I bet that's the broad
with the big bucks.

680
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,500
Hey come on over here,
darling.

681
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,083
I've got the best
stool in the house

682
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,834
saved for you.

683
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:04,542
So this is where you've
been hiding, Jean-Luc.

684
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:05,959
I'm surprised you let
this part

685
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,208
of the ship
get this dirty.

686
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,625
Oh, relax,
Commander.

687
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:12,166
You've been making your
true feelings quite clear.

688
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:16,166
Obviously, you feel
unable to handle me.

689
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:18,125
Anyway, why would
a beautiful

690
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,792
high-class lady
like yourself

691
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:22,834
want to hook up
with a mug like that?

692
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:25,125
You're too good for him
if you ask me.

693
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:28,000
You are a very
interesting person.

694
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,750
You're not so bad
yourself.

695
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:34,208
In fact, you're as much class
as this joint's ever seen.

696
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,959
Here.
On the house.

697
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,625
It's French...
well, almost.

698
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,500
This is the most
remarkable man.

699
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:45,625
I've never met anyone
like him.

700
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:48,083
I don't suppose
you have.

701
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,792
He's strong.

702
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:53,083
I get no thoughts
from him at all, nothing.

703
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,959
Well I've never known
a man so able

704
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,333
to keep his true
feelings completely hidden.

705
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:01,750
That's because--
No man has ever...

706
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,166
been such a mystery to me.

707
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,875
I usually know their thoughts
before they do.

708
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,417
But not with me, huh?

709
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:11,709
No.

710
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,959
And I never realized
how erotic that could be.

711
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:22,333
Um... carry my beverage
to that table.

712
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,959
We have some things
to discuss.

713
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:55,041
Should we tell her?

714
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,542
(<i> sighing )</i>

715
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:59,041
I think it would be
only fair...

716
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:02,083
but let's
allow her the moment.

717
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:07,875
<i>(shouting</i> )

718
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,375
Worf, the vermicula.

719
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:11,583
(<i> shouting</i> )

720
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,792
Pulaski to Captain Picard.

721
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:22,166
Go ahead, doctor.

722
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:24,667
Our passengers are
on their... feet.

723
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:25,792
Understood.

724
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:27,583
We better get
to the bridge.

725
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,417
What's their condition?

726
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:30,750
Hungry.

727
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:36,542
Would you like to be shown
to your rooms?

728
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,667
Are you coming,
Mrs. Troi?

729
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:53,875
Uh, not just yet.

730
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:57,083
Tell William that
I'm sorry,

731
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:59,500
but Rex and I are
getting married.

732
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:04,208
Mrs. Troi, your government
expects me

733
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,417
to deliver you to
the conference on time,

734
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,166
and that's what I intend
to do.

735
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:12,834
Pity.

736
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:15,667
Duty calls,
darling.

737
00:42:15,709 --> 00:42:18,500
But I'll be back
for you later.

738
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:21,542
PICARD:
Mrs. Troi,
there is something

739
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,667
you ought to know
about Rex.

740
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,041
Oh?

741
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,583
Imagine, allowing me
to go on like that

742
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:41,333
with that man
who doesn't even exist.

743
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,500
But you always say you
like surprises, Mother.

744
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:44,875
Hmm.

745
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:49,000
Why are they still here?

746
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,625
We thought since you were
going to the same conference,

747
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,333
you might like to beam down
with the other delegates.

748
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:57,375
Oh, they're not delegates,
those two are assassins.

749
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:00,166
That is an outrage!
Lies!

750
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:03,000
We demand you transport us
at once.

751
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,417
Don't bother
to deny it.

752
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:05,834
Your minds are
so unsophisticated,

753
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,792
I can read your thoughts
in my sleep.

754
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:10,333
Oh, their robes
are lined with ultritium.

755
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:11,709
Highly explosive,

756
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,291
virtually undetectable
by your transporter.

757
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:18,208
She is correct, sir.

758
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,417
I am detecting large
amounts of ultritium.

759
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:21,709
Well, of course you are.
They were planning

760
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,875
on blowing up
the entire conference.

761
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:26,417
Mr. Worf,
take them to level 5.

762
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:28,458
Disarm them.
Hold them for questioning.

763
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,583
Aye, sir.

764
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,125
Ah, well, I didn't
find a mate,

765
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,792
but I did save
the conference,

766
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:54,250
as well as
your reputations.

767
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,500
All in a day's work,
I suppose.

768
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:59,000
Good-bye, Mrs. Troi...

769
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,750
and, thank you.

770
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:10,291
PICARD:
Energize, Chief O'Brien.

771
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:15,583
Jean-Luc...

772
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:18,458
shame on you for
thinking such a thing.
