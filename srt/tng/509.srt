1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,333
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45349.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,792
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is on its way</i>
<i>to Penthara Four</i>

3
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:09,500
<i>where a type "C" asteroid</i>

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,000
<i>has struck</i>
<i>an unpopulated continent.</i>

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,875
<i>The resulting dust cloud could</i>
<i>very well create a phenomenon</i>

6
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,375
<i>not unlike the nuclear winters</i>
<i>of 21st century Earth.</i>

7
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,291
<i>Commander La Forge</i>
<i>has begun work on a plan</i>

8
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,959
<i>that would counteract</i>
<i>the devastation.</i>

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,792
I'm afraid the numbers
coming in are already

10
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,458
indicating climatic
changes, Commander.

11
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,166
What kind of drop
can we expect?

12
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,208
If the Pentharan spheral
forecasts are correct,

13
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:35,125
10 to 12 degrees Celsius
within the first ten days.

14
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,667
If it continues like that,
their entire ecosystem

15
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,166
will be shot
to hell.

16
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,709
And I doubt if they
are prepared to cope with

17
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:41,125
the kind of cold
that's coming.

18
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,000
PICARD: Commander Riker?
Yes, sir.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,667
Would you join me
on the bridge please?

20
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:45,875
RIKER:
Right away, sir.

21
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,208
Are you certain,
Mr. Worf?

22
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,834
There was a space-time
distortion, sir.

23
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,083
And there is something
back there.

24
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,458
We passed within
300 kilometers of it.

25
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,166
That's too close
to be a coincidence.

26
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,208
Mr. La Forge.

27
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,709
LA FORGE:
Yes, Captain?

28
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:58,875
Would a delay of one hour
affect your plans?

29
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,500
Not unless another
asteroid decides

30
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,041
to play a call on
Penthara, sir.

31
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,625
The odds of that
occurring, Captain,

32
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,792
are extremely unlikely,
given the time frame.

33
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,959
Thank you, Mr. Data.

34
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,458
Ensign, bring
the ship about.

35
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,250
Let's take a look
at Mr. Worf's distortion.

36
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,500
Aye, sir.

37
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,875
Mr. Worf's what?

38
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,417
The lieutenant's sensors
have detected

39
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,458
a temporal distortion
almost in our current course.

40
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,709
There's a small object
back there

41
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,208
that wasn't there
a few moments ago.

42
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,959
The object is
50 kilometers ahead, sir.

43
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,500
Full stop, Ensign.
Aye, sir.

44
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,834
On screen.

45
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,166
RIKER:
Dimensions, Worf?

46
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,583
Approximately five meters
in length, sir.

47
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,583
Life signs?

48
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,375
No signs
of any kind.

49
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,709
Our sensors do not
penetrate the hull.

50
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,291
Try hailing it.

51
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:45,792
Now, that's odd.
What's odd?

52
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:48,709
We've received
a response, but...

53
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:52,542
Yes, Mr. Worf?

54
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:54,792
They want you
to "move over," sir.

55
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:00,709
Reply that the<i> Enterprise</i> isn't
going anywhere, lieutenant.

56
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:03,750
Not the<i> Enterprise,</i>  Captain--
you.

57
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,000
What are you trying
to tell me, Mr. Worf?

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,959
Oops.
Excuse me, Captain,

59
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,208
but you were
standing

60
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,542
right where
I needed to be.

61
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:13,792
Who are you?

62
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:16,000
Rasmussen's
the name, sir.

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,959
Professor Berlinghoff
Rasmussen.

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, this is wonderful.

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,250
Actually, quite a bit larger
than I thought.

66
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,333
Really?

67
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,792
Where I come from,

68
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:31,041
every historian knows
the bridge of old 1701-D.

69
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,375
And where, exactly,
do you come from?

70
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,709
Why, Earth.

71
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:39,750
The late 26th century
Earth, to be exact.

72
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,458
I've traveled back
nearly 300 years

73
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,875
just to find you.

74
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,417
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

75
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:22,792
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

76
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,417
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

77
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:28,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

78
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:32,709
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

79
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:36,667
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

80
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:38,917
Exactly what kind
of historian are you?

81
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,291
Oh, my focus
is on the 22nd

82
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,625
through the
24th centuries--

83
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,500
early interstellar
history.

84
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,000
You know, it was
always believed

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,250
this was on your desk,
not here.

86
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,166
Fascinating.

87
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't you move it
on my account.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You can't expect me
to believe that

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,583
the layout
of my ready room

90
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,542
can possibly be of interest
to future historians.

91
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:07,792
Oh, no less so than your
legendary modesty, Captain.

92
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,250
I wish I could
describe to you

93
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,667
what a thrill
it is to be here.

94
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,750
This is the original.

95
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,417
You flatter me,
Professor.

96
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,792
But I can't help
but wonder

97
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,709
what could possibly
have caused you

98
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:23,542
to select<i> me</i> as a subject
for your study.

99
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,959
Even in this decade,
there are...

100
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,959
far wiser and more
experienced humans

101
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,458
in and out
of Starfleet.

102
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,959
I'd love to
tell you, Picard,

103
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,750
I really would, but...

104
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,041
try and imagine
what a young Caesar

105
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,250
might have done
differently

106
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,458
had someone given<i> him</i>

107
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,792
a hint of
what lay ahead,

108
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,083
or if Lincoln
had been coerced

109
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,583
into changing
his theater plans.

110
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,875
I truly wish
I could be more specific

111
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,375
on why<i> you</i> were selected,

112
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:52,458
but I'm afraid
the exchange of information

113
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,750
will have to flow

114
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,917
in one direction only.

115
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:59,709
Five, six, seven meters.

116
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:03,500
Ha!
I was right.

117
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,000
Why now?
LA FORGE: Right.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,542
If you've come back
to study us,

119
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:08,083
to study the captain,
why did you pick today?

120
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,875
Why not a year ago?
Or a year from now?

121
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,667
Oh, I picked the right
day, all right.

122
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,834
Just wait. You'll see.

123
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,333
Um... do you always
sit there

124
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,125
on that side
of the table?

125
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,458
Usually.
Why?

126
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,166
It's... not important.

127
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,000
Professor, at what point
does time travel

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,041
become a tool
for historians?

129
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,041
Now, now, Commander,

130
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,917
you know better than that.

131
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:35,709
I've studied a great deal
about your century,

132
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,125
including the fact
that you're all quite aware

133
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,625
of the dangers of anyone
altering the past,

134
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,750
and that's exactly
what I'd be doing

135
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,959
if I were to divulge

136
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,458
information
like that.

137
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,667
Telurian plague.

138
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,500
Beg your pardon?

139
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,291
The Telurian plague--
was it cured?

140
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,166
I mean, did they find
the cure by your century?

141
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,083
Oh, it can't do any harm
to ask that.

142
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,542
I realize
that it's difficult,

143
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,333
but we must keep
to ourselves

144
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,333
questions
about the future.

145
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,792
Go on, Professor.

146
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,917
I'll be preparing
questionnaires for each of you.

147
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:08,000
Please complete them
at your convenience.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,792
If you're concerned
about a possible

149
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,291
breach of security,

150
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,500
I'm sure your captain
can make a determination.

151
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,291
And, thank you in advance
for curbing your curiosity.

152
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,709
If I hand my assignment
in on time,

153
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,667
can I get a glimpse into
next week's poker game?

154
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:27,291
(<i> chuckling</i> )

155
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,041
Mr. Data, would you
escort the professor

156
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,250
to his quarters?

157
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,417
This way, sir.

158
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,875
What did he mean
he "picked the right day"?

159
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,625
You know everything
I do, Number One.

160
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,208
Deanna?

161
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,709
It's hard to tell, but
he is holding something back.

162
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:48,917
CRUSHER:
Well, of course
he is.

163
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,333
All the things
he could tell us.

164
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,083
All the things
he would like to tell us.

165
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:57,041
It might be that.
I don't know.

166
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,291
What if he's an imposter?

167
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,542
God knows we've seen
enough of them.

168
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,333
Well, he is human.
The medical scans

169
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,667
have proven that,
right, Doctor?

170
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,166
He's human,
all right.

171
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,500
And there was
a temporal distortion

172
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,875
back there, correct,
Mr. Worf?

173
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes, sir.

174
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,375
And no one
can deny that

175
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,667
that ship of his
is unlike

176
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,125
anything
we've ever seen.

177
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,083
LA FORGE:
The hull is made
of some kind of

178
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,667
plasticized
tritanium mesh.

179
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,917
We've nothing like it
on record.

180
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:22,125
At least,
not until now.
Hmm.

181
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,792
Mr. Worf, I do
appreciate your caution.

182
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,792
I share it.

183
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,417
Bring his vessel
into the shuttle bay.

184
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:34,000
Place it under guard.
Yes, sir.

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,667
(<i> sighs</i> )
I realize that
this... visit

186
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,959
is going to be difficult
for some of us.

187
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,333
But I've examined
his credentials

188
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,917
and everything seems
to be in order,

189
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:46,917
so I think we should extend
to him every courtesy.

190
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:49,583
Including
questionnaires?

191
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,834
Including questionnaires,
Mr. Worf.

192
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,709
This is really
a thrill, Data.

193
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:01,917
Like running across
a Redstone missile,

194
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,500
or a Gutenberg bible.

195
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,166
To think-- the model "T"
of androids.

196
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,583
If you were referring
to the first

197
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,125
production model automobile
of the 20th century,

198
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,750
perhaps the subsequent
model "A"

199
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,583
would be
a more apt analogy,

200
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,583
since I am Dr. Noonian Soong's
revised prototype.

201
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,500
I stand corrected.

202
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,834
Is there a problem,
Professor?

203
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:45,500
Hmm, I suppose it will have
to do... for now.

204
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,417
I'll get you a list of the
things I'll be needing, okay?

205
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,750
Would I be correct,
Professor,

206
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,208
in assuming that you know
whether or not I am still...

207
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,500
alive in
the 26th century?

208
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,208
Since you seem
to know so much

209
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,208
about Captain Picard
and the ship, I assumed you--

210
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,500
It would be best if
you kept your assumptions

211
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,166
to yourself,
wouldn't it?

212
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,083
Yes, sir.

213
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,000
Sorry, sir.

214
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:56,125
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45350.3.</i>

215
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,000
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>at Penthara Four</i>

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,583
<i>and can see</i>
<i>for ourselves</i>

217
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,083
<i>the atmospheric devastation</i>
<i>caused</i>

218
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,041
<i>by the asteroid's impact.</i>

219
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,792
We've located
three underground pockets

220
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,250
of carbon dioxide--
here, here,

221
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,500
and here.

222
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,333
Now, our drilling
phasers

223
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,250
can release enough of
the gas to form an envelope,

224
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,083
which should temporarily
hold in the heat of the sun.

225
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,625
We spend years, decades,
trying to avoid anything

226
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,959
that would lead
to a greenhouse effect,

227
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,709
and now here we are about to...
create one on purpose.

228
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,583
Less than 20% of
your normal sunlight

229
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,542
is getting through through
that dust, Doctor.

230
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:44,083
If we can hold enough
heat in with the CO2,

231
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,500
that should give
the planet time

232
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,959
to mend itself.
WOMAN: Excuse me, Dr. Moseley?

233
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,250
What now?

234
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,375
New Seattle's reporting

235
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,500
a cloud depth
of 12 kilometers.

236
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,291
Two rivers--
<i>tropical</i> rivers--

237
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,291
are beginning
to freeze.

238
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,542
We'd better get started

239
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,709
before there's nothing
left to mend.

240
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,542
RIKER:
Look who's here.

241
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:10,750
Oh.

242
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,834
I hate
questionnaires.

243
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,041
Professor!

244
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,375
Come and join us.

245
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,542
Hope I'm not intruding.
Not at all.

246
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,166
I'm sure you're the topic
of conversation

247
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,500
at every table
in this room.

248
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,417
Uh, as I promised,

249
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,834
here are your
assignments,

250
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:37,458
and I'm sure
they'll be painless.

251
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:41,542
Please try and complete
them by tomorrow.

252
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:43,458
Tomorrow?

253
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,417
No problem, Professor.

254
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,834
Ah, you're all very calm.

255
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,917
Is there some reason
we shouldn't be?

256
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,250
History always records
where people were,

257
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,458
what they were doing,

258
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,083
when important events
took place.

259
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,125
But it rarely remembers
their activity, say,

260
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,500
a week before, or a day,
or even an hour.

261
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,834
Are you
suggesting that

262
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,709
an important event
is imminent?

263
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,083
I didn't say that,
now did I?

264
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,834
Please, just go on doing
what you're doing

265
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,375
and pretend I'm not here.

266
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,917
Why is there no record
of other future historians

267
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,542
traveling back to witness
important events?

268
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,542
We're obviously
very careful.

269
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:21,750
As a matter of fact,

270
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,875
a colleague and I
recently paid a call

271
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,208
on a 22nd century
vessel.

272
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,542
They hadn't perfected
quarantine fields.

273
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,375
You probably saw some
surgical masks and gloves.

274
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,250
Isn't it fascinating

275
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,375
how everyone has
different interests

276
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,709
when it comes
to history.

277
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,875
Different perspectives
on progress.

278
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,917
Would you mind telling me
what that is?

279
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,375
Oh, just checking
the time.

280
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,625
No problem.

281
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,834
Is something important
supposed to be happening here?

282
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,875
Oh, no, it's nothing,
it's nothing.

283
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,375
What about you,
Commander?

284
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,625
What do you see as
the most important example

285
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,709
of progress in
the last 200 years?

286
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,792
I suppose, the warp coil.

287
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,417
Before there was warp drive,

288
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:06,375
humans were confined to
a single sector of the galaxy.

289
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,959
Spoken like
the consummate explorer.

290
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,709
What is going on?

291
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:15,375
Are you expecting
someone?

292
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,959
Phasers.

293
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,333
Beg your pardon?

294
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,500
There were no phasers
in the 22nd century.

295
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,542
Ah, you see, Doctor?

296
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,917
Our Klingon friend
is a perfect example

297
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,291
of what I was trying
to tell you.

298
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,917
He views history
through the eyes

299
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,750
of a hunter,
a warrior.

300
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,375
His passion lies
in the perfection

301
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,458
of the tools
of violence.

302
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,500
How delightfully
primitive.

303
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,709
As soon as we input this
atmospheric data from Moseley,

304
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:46,709
the computer should tell us how
many holes we'll have to punch.

305
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:48,125
What have you learned
about the tectonic stability

306
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,166
around the drilling sites?
Couldn't be better.

307
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,291
Our scans were all clear and
Moseley says there hasn't been

308
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,375
so much as a quiver down
there in well over a century.

309
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,250
A-ha, just the two
I'm looking for.

310
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,875
Um, brought you the forms
I need you to complete.

311
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,041
Shouldn't take anything more
than a couple of hours.

312
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,333
We're kind of
busy here, Professor.

313
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,959
Tomorrow would
probably be better.

314
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,500
Data, we've got about
23,000 thermal simulations.

315
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,291
You think you could check
them over for anomalies?

316
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,000
Certainly.

317
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,834
Is that as fast
as he can go?

318
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:32,834
Not fast enough
for you, Professor?

319
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:35,792
There's very little known
about Data's efficiency.

320
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:38,291
Almost nothing about
its part in this mission.

321
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:42,500
It's a topic of
great conjecture.

322
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,834
DATA:
209 anomalies,

323
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:45,750
all within acceptable
parameters.

324
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,542
Thanks, Data.

325
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,333
You're here
to witness this mission.

326
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,792
That's it, isn't it?

327
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:56,500
It would be best
if you just thought of me

328
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,417
as a fly on the wall
and went about your business.

329
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,750
I will have
your answered questions

330
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,250
as soon as possible,
Professor.

331
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,583
Data...
at Penthara Four!

332
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,709
If you'll excuse me.

333
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:10,166
Um, your prosthesis--

334
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,709
what do you--
what do you call it again?

335
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:12,959
A visor.

336
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,709
Visor, right, a visor.

337
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,208
You know, I have
a picture of you

338
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,709
wearing that
in my office.

339
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,083
How do you like it?

340
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,250
It allows me to see,
and I like it just fine.

341
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,458
You know,
Homer was blind.

342
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:28,667
Milton... Bach...
Monet... Wonder.

343
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,125
A fly on the wall,
huh?

344
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,417
A fly on the wall.

345
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:34,709
The computer has configured

346
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,083
the drilling patterns
in specified depths.

347
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,542
Captain, we've got
everything we need.

348
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,667
I'm ready to transport
down to the surface.

349
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,542
PICARD:
I'll notify Dr. Moseley.
Good luck, Geordi.

350
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:47,166
Gentlemen.

351
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,041
Who said these moments
were any less exciting

352
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,125
when you know
the outcome, hmm?

353
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,500
I know of no one
who said that, Professor.

354
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,625
The<i> Enterprise</i> will monitor
the CO2 concentrations

355
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,458
at six different
altitudes.

356
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,875
If all goes well,
it shouldn't take

357
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,667
more than 20
bore sites.

358
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,500
Let's hope all goes well.

359
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:22,875
La Forge to Commander Riker.
How are you doing?

360
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,959
RIKER:
We've gotten word from
the monitoring stations.

361
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,250
They're all online.

362
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,750
We're ready
when you are, Geordi.

363
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,041
That's excellent.

364
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,667
All we need now is
an open channel to Data.

365
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,834
Open a channel,
Mr. Worf,

366
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,542
and prepare
to fire at target one.

367
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,083
The computer has locked in
phaser depth calculations.

368
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,625
Mr. Data?
Ready, sir.

369
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,959
Fire.

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,959
Target one is emitting
2,000 cubic meters per second.

371
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,417
Target two, 1,600.

372
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:05,834
The surface wind patterns
over the target are stable.

373
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,041
You picking up anything
at altitude, Data?

374
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,709
DATA:
CO2 concentrations remain
unchanged at upper elevations.

375
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,208
Have I missed much?

376
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,458
Target 14 complete,
sir.

377
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,875
Data,
what have you got?

378
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,542
No change, sir.

379
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,750
RIKER:
How are the surface winds,
Geordi?

380
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,917
Holding steady, sir.

381
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,250
The computer
has stopped drilling.

382
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,458
You should be getting
something now, Data.

383
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,750
Elevated CO2 levels
at 20 kilometers, sir.

384
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,125
Now your talking.

385
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,834
We've got some new
temperatures coming in.

386
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,583
All thermal
monitoring stations

387
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,250
are reporting no further
temperature drops.

388
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,458
Correction, Doctor--
two equatorial stations

389
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,792
are reporting
slight increases.

390
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:06,542
Thank you.
Thank you, all.

391
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,959
You've given us
what we need-- time.

392
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,792
We're glad to
be of help, doctor.

393
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,166
The<i> Enterprise</i> 
will remain in orbit

394
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,291
and continue to monitor
your progress.

395
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,458
Picard out.

396
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,166
"You've given us
what we need--

397
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,083
time."

398
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,792
Ensign, return
to synchronous orbit.

399
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,750
Aye, sir.

400
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,417
Very clever, Picard.

401
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,083
And well done.

402
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,625
We always knew
how you did it,

403
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:35,166
but to experience the moment,
to witness the nuances,

404
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:39,166
it's, uh...
indescribable.

405
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,166
He's after more than
a history lesson,

406
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,583
I can tell
you that.

407
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,542
What is it?
What are you getting from him?

408
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:54,125
I don't know.

409
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,166
It's like he's trying
to confuse us,

410
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,500
misdirect us, somehow.

411
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,542
RASMUSSEN:
There you are!

412
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:03,041
Well, that certainly
was exciting, wasn't it?

413
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,166
Professor, is everything
all right? Are you well?

414
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,125
Yes, couldn't be better,
thank you.

415
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,458
I just thought we might chat
about your questionnaire.

416
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,709
Buck up, crewman.

417
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,375
You're a credit
to that uniform.

418
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,667
I've got some things
to take care of.

419
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:16,917
Uh, no, please,
Counselor,

420
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,208
I'd very much appreciate
your remaining.

421
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,959
Doctor, in response
to my sixth question,

422
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,250
you spoke of
a neural stimulator.

423
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,500
May I see one?

424
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,208
I don't see why not.
Give me a minute.

425
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,333
You don't like me
very much, do you?

426
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,750
I don't<i> dislike</i> you,
Professor.

427
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,000
Keep your eyes wide,
soldier.

428
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,375
You'll be telling
your grandchildren

429
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,083
how you were there
at Penthara Four.

430
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
But you don't
trust me.

431
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,834
You should,
you know.

432
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,000
Should I?

433
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,625
"Picard's empath
won't trust you."

434
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,875
That's what
they all said.

435
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,500
Picard's empath?

436
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,083
We're not that unalike,
you and I.

437
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,333
You possess a sense that
is foreign to the others.

438
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,875
My knowledge of
the future is similar.

439
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,542
You know, some of my
best friends are empaths.

440
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,166
They trust me.

441
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,583
Why should you care whether
I trust you or not?

442
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,875
We're birds of a feather.

443
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,709
We're colleagues.

444
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:23,875
We could learn a lot
from each other.

445
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:27,125
You're right.
I don't trust you.

446
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,750
I knew you'd say that.

447
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,875
I'm sure you did.

448
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,458
Well, I'm glad to see you two
are finally getting along.

449
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,625
I really have
to be going.

450
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,542
Thank you.

451
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,375
Why don't you try
a berylite scan.

452
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,458
I'd be interested to see
what his micro-levels are.

453
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:54,500
So, what else
can I show you?

454
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,333
You're a very
curious woman.

455
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,583
Hmm?

456
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,750
No, no, I don't mean
curious like that.

457
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,500
I mean, you're curious...
about things.

458
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,166
About... berylite levels.

459
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:12,166
About... the future.

460
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,917
Well, curiosity
is why

461
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,250
all of us are
out here, isn't it?

462
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,333
I understand,
but you're different.

463
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,250
You're more... vibrant.

464
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,500
You're more, um...

465
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,208
More vibrant?

466
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,333
That's nice.
I like that.

467
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,875
You know,
whenever I travel back,

468
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,125
I meet very
interesting people,

469
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,875
men and women,
but, um...

470
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,291
I've never met anyone

471
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,500
who gave me thoughts
about not going home.

472
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,875
You're not
supposed to be

473
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,542
influencing
the past, remember?

474
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,834
Well...

475
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,917
And I am beginning
to feel

476
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:55,917
just a little
bit... influenced.

477
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:59,500
Anyway, I could be
your great, great,

478
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,250
great, great
grandmother.

479
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:21,667
What kind of questions did
he have for you, Number One?

480
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:24,000
All he wanted to know
about was previous starships--

481
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,083
what I thought was innovative
about the last<i> Enterprise,</i>

482
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,291
the one before that.

483
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,542
He said he wanted
to see if we had

484
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,667
"a grasp of
the fundamentals."

485
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,917
His questions to me primarily
focused on Dr. Soong's--

486
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:35,542
(<i> alarm ringing</i> )

487
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:39,500
Captain, I'm detecting a massive
earthquake on the surface.

488
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,917
<i>Two</i> earthquakes.
Location?

489
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:43,291
Both epicenters are beneath

490
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,041
the two southernmost
drill sites, Captain.

491
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,291
Is La Forge
still down there?

492
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,875
WORF: Yes, sir.
Find him.

493
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,333
(<i> alarm ringing</i> )

494
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,000
We've also got some volcanic
activity, pretty severe.

495
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,041
PICARD:
Magnify.

496
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,333
La Forge here, Captain.

497
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,542
Moseley and I are on
our way back to his lab.

498
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:02,917
Are you all right?

499
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:05,291
We're okay,
but those were pretty big, sir.

500
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,625
If this was earth,
I'd say around

501
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,542
an 8 or an 8.5 on
the Richter scale.

502
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:12,709
We're starting to see
some volcanic plumes, Captain.

503
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:15,583
(<i> alarms ringing</i> )

504
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,333
Two more eruptions.

505
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,917
It is likely we overestimated
the geologic stability

506
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,959
around the CO2 pockets,
Captain.

507
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,834
LA FORGE:
We're in the lab, sir.

508
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,875
On screen.

509
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,417
We're fairly well quake-proof
down here, Picard.

510
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:31,166
It's the volcanic dust
I'm worried about.

511
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:35,583
What about the dust?

512
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,709
The ash the volcanoes are
throwing into the atmosphere

513
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,000
is gonna compound
the existing problem.

514
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,542
In a matter of days,
there'll be no sunlight

515
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:42,917
getting through
these clouds.

516
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:46,000
MOSELEY: No amount of CO2
will help us then.

517
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,291
Captain, take
a look at this.

518
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:57,125
These are the coordinates
of the eruptions,

519
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,000
and these...

520
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,500
are the coordinates of
the phaser drilling sites.

521
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,458
The mantle is collapsing

522
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,083
where the pressure
was released.

523
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:09,875
LA FORGE:
Captain, Dr. Moseley and I
have a couple of ideas,

524
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,333
but it's gonna take some time
to sort them out.

525
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,875
Sort them out, Geordi.

526
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,750
Aye, sir.

527
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,208
We came here
to help these people.

528
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:24,375
And look what
we've done.

529
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:41,750
(<i> multiple classical songs</i>
<i>playing loudly</i> )

530
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,333
(<i> shouting</i> )
What in God's name<i> is</i> that?

531
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,333
Music, Professor.
Music?

532
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,625
Yes, sir.

533
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,709
Mozart's<i> Jupiter</i>
<i>Symphony in C-major,</i>

534
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:53,417
Bach's<i> Brandenburg</i>
<i>Concerto #3,</i>

535
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:55,709
Beethoven's<i> Ninth Symphony,</i>
<i>Second Movement,</i>

536
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:57,291
<i>"Molto Vivace"</i>

537
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:00,750
and<i> "La Donna e Mobile"</i> 
from Verdi's <i> Rigoletto.</i>

538
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,792
You think you could
thin it out a bit?

539
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:07,583
Computer, eliminate
program one.

540
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:14,041
Computer, eliminate
program two.

541
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,792
Computer, eliminate
program three.

542
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:25,583
Computer, half volume.

543
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,875
(<i> shouting</i> )
How the--

544
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,375
(<i> normally</i> )
How the hell can you listen

545
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,709
to four pieces of music
at the same time?

546
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:33,333
Actually I am capable
of distinguishing

547
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:36,333
over 150 simultaneous
compositions.

548
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,583
But in order to analyze
the aesthetics,

549
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:41,834
I try to keep it
to 10 or less.

550
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,709
Only four today?

551
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,166
I am assisting
Commander La Forge

552
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,959
with a very complex
calculation.

553
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,792
It demands a great deal
of my concentration.

554
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,667
Hmm.
Well, I, um...

555
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,709
came to thank you
for answering my questions,

556
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,041
though I probably
should have asked you

557
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:58,333
to limit yourself
to 50,000 words.

558
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,500
You did ask me
to be thorough.

559
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,542
I realize it's hard
to believe, Data,

560
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:06,208
but very few records
of Dr. Soong's work

561
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,417
survived to
the 26th century,

562
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,041
so it would be invaluable

563
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:13,291
to myself
and other historians

564
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,583
if you could provide us
with some... schematics?

565
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:19,750
Certainly-- as soon as
my work here is completed.

566
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,166
As long as it's before
0900 tomorrow.

567
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,709
That's when I'll be, uh...
heading back.

568
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,083
WORF:
Bridge to Commander Data.

569
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,750
Yes, Worf?

570
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,375
Commander La Forge is hailing
you from the surface, sir.

571
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,083
Patch him through, please.

572
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,166
Have you rerun the phase
reversal figures, Data?

573
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,542
There were
no errors, Geordi.

574
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:37,875
The variance
must be no more

575
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,417
than .06 terawatts.

576
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,667
Well, I don't see
any other choice.

577
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,333
We'll continue to run
the numbers down here,

578
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,792
but I doubt we'll come up
with anything different.

579
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,083
You'd better inform
the captain

580
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,250
of the good news
and the bad news.

581
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,458
La Forge out.

582
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:54,542
Which do you suppose he's gonna
want to hear first?

583
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,500
The good news.

584
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,917
The motion
of the dust

585
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:03,375
has created a great deal
of electrostatic energy

586
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,166
in the upper atmosphere.

587
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:06,875
With a modified phaser blast,

588
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:09,333
we can create a shock front
that would encircle the planet

589
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,208
and ionize the particles.

590
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:14,417
That would be like striking
a spark in a gas-filled room.

591
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:16,125
With one exception, sir--

592
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,458
the particles would
be converted

593
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,166
into a high-energy plasma,

594
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,667
which our shields
could absorb

595
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:23,333
and then redirect
harmlessly into space.

596
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,625
Turn the<i> Enterprise</i> 
into a lightning rod.

597
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:26,917
Precisely, sir.

598
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,417
And the bad news?

599
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:29,917
If our phaser
discharge is off

600
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,375
by as little as
.06 terawatts,

601
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:33,709
it would cause
a cascading

602
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:36,875
exothermal inversion.
Meaning?

603
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:40,000
We would completely burn off
the planet's atmosphere.

604
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,166
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

605
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:51,291
<i>While Dr. Moseley</i>
<i>takes La Forge's plan</i>

606
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,917
<i>to the leaders</i>
<i>of the colony,</i>

607
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:55,667
<i>I find myself weighing</i>
<i>the potential consequences</i>

608
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,125
<i>of a more philosophical</i>
<i>issue.</i>

609
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,417
(<i> door chimes</i> )

610
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:01,291
Come.

611
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:08,125
I imagine you know why
I've asked you here.

612
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,959
Yeah, I have
a fairly good idea.

613
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,333
I'm faced
with a dilemma.

614
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,583
There is
a planet beneath us

615
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:16,208
which is slowly
turning to ice,

616
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,458
and unless we do
something about it,

617
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,208
I'm told that
in a matter of weeks,

618
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:23,834
thousands, maybe tens
of thousands, will die.

619
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:26,125
That would be a shame.

620
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,875
Yes, it would.

621
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,333
It would be
quite a shame.

622
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:34,208
So, um...
what's your dilemma?

623
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,542
Commander La Forge has
a possible solution.

624
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:40,458
The margins of error
are extremely critical.

625
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,000
But if successful...

626
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,917
there will be
no more threat.

627
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,875
And if it's
not successful?

628
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:48,500
Every living thing on
the planet will perish.

629
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,125
So, do nothing,
and thousands<i> will</i> die.

630
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,417
Do something,
and millions<i> could</i> die.

631
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,375
That's a tough choice.

632
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:00,041
Not if you were
to help me.

633
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,333
You're not suggesting

634
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,917
I tell you the outcome
of your efforts?

635
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:06,333
Oh, no!
I am not.

636
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:07,792
Everything that
Starfleet stands for,

637
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,709
everything that I
have ever believed in,

638
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,542
tells me I cannot
ask you that.

639
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:14,542
But, at the same time,

640
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:17,166
there are 20 million
lives down there.

641
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,166
And you know what
happened to them--

642
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,417
what<i> will</i> happen
to them.

643
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,834
So it seems you have
another dilemma,

644
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:28,709
one that questions
your convictions.

645
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:30,083
Well, I've never
been afraid

646
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,208
of reevaluating my
convictions, Professor,

647
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:36,291
and now, well, I have
20 million reasons to do so.

648
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:39,959
And why did you
ask to see me?

649
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,959
Because your
presence gives me

650
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:44,417
a potential access
to a kind of information

651
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:47,333
that I've never had
available to me before.

652
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:51,125
And if I am to
reexamine my beliefs,

653
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:55,250
then I must take advantage
of every possible asset.

654
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,500
It would have been
irresponsible of me

655
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,166
<i>not</i> to ask you here.

656
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:00,250
However you come to terms
with your beliefs, Captain,

657
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,250
I must tell you, I'm quite
comfortable with mine.

658
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,625
How can you be?

659
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,750
How can you be comfortable
watching people die?

660
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:13,417
Um... let me put it
to you this way.

661
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:16,375
If I were to tell you that
none of those people died,

662
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,709
you'd easily conclude

663
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,375
that you tried your solution
and it succeeded,

664
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,917
so you would
confidently try again.

665
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,333
No harm in that.

666
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:27,625
But, what if I were
to tell you they all died?

667
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,542
What then?
Obviously, you'd decide

668
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:31,458
not to make
the same mistake twice.

669
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:32,792
Now, what if one
of those people grew--

670
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:34,041
Yes, Professor,
I know.

671
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,500
What if one of
those lives

672
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
I save down there
is a child

673
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,542
who grows up to be
the next Adolf Hitler?

674
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,834
Or, Khan Singh?

675
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,208
Every first-year
philosophy student

676
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,792
has been asked
that question since

677
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:46,291
the earliest wormholes
were discovered.

678
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:49,125
But this is not a class
in temporal logic.

679
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,291
It's not theoretical,

680
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,291
it's not hypothetical,
it's real!

681
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:55,333
Surely you see that.
I see it all too well.

682
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:58,542
But you must see that
if I were to influence you,

683
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,834
everything in this sector,

684
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,458
in this quadrant of
the galaxy could change.

685
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:06,750
History--<i> my</i> history--
would unfold in a way other

686
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,291
than it already has.

687
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,917
Now, what possible
incentive

688
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:14,291
could anyone offer me
to allow that to happen?

689
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:16,208
I have two choices.

690
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:18,709
Either way, one version
of history or another

691
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:20,875
will wend
its way forward--

692
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,250
the history you know,
or another one.

693
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,750
Now, who is to say
which is better?

694
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,625
What I do know
is that here, today,

695
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,834
one way millions of lives
could be saved.

696
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:33,208
Now isn't that
incentive enough?

697
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,709
Everyone dies,
Captain.

698
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:37,333
It's just a question
of when.

699
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,583
All those people
down there

700
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,583
died years
before I was born.

701
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,959
All of you
up here as well.

702
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:45,500
So you see I can't get
quite as worked up as you

703
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,583
over the fate
of some colonists

704
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,875
who for me have been dead
a very, very long time.

705
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,875
Of course, you know
of the prime directive,

706
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,583
which tells us
that we have no right

707
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:59,250
to interfere in the natural
evolution of alien worlds.

708
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,166
Now, I have sworn
to uphold it.

709
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:05,125
But, nevertheless,
I have

710
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:08,834
disregarded
that directive...

711
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:11,834
on more than one
occasion...

712
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:15,291
because I thought
it was the<i> right thing to do!</i>

713
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:18,583
Now, if you are
holding on to some

714
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:22,333
temporal equivalent
of that directive,

715
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,625
then isn't
it possible that

716
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:25,917
you have
an occasion here

717
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:29,375
to make an exception,
to...

718
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,583
to help me to choose

719
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,458
because it's
the right thing to do?

720
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:35,875
Are we just talking
about a choice?

721
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,125
It sounds to me like
you're trying

722
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,667
to manipulate
the future.

723
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:39,875
But every choice we make

724
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:42,083
allows us to manipulate
the future.

725
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:45,000
Do I, um...
do I invite Adrienne

726
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,375
or Suzanne to
the spring dance?

727
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:49,750
Do I take my holiday
on Corsica, or Risa?

728
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,834
A person's life,
their future,

729
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:56,125
hinges on each of
a thousand choices.

730
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,333
Living is making
choices.

731
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:00,959
Now you ask me to believe
that if I make a choice

732
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,500
other than the one
that appears

733
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,583
in your history books,

734
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:07,625
then your past will be
irrevocably altered.

735
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,375
Well, you know,
Professor,

736
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,417
perhaps I don't give
a damn about your past

737
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,208
because your past
is my future.

738
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,792
And as far as I'm concerned,
it hasn't been written yet!

739
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,583
RIKER:
Captain, the electrostatic
conditions are about as good

740
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:22,917
as they're going to get.

741
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:25,375
If we're going to try this,
now is the time.

742
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,500
Please don't ask me,
Captain.

743
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,125
I can't help you.

744
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:36,417
I'm sorry.

745
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,166
How long will it take
to program

746
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,375
the phasers, Number One?

747
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,625
We've just got to
tie into

748
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,083
Geordi's
atmospheric sensors.

749
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,208
So you've made
your choice after all...

750
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:52,583
and without my help.

751
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,333
Oh, on the contrary,
Professor.

752
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,667
You were quite helpful.
How's that?

753
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:58,750
By refusing
to help me,

754
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,166
you left me with
the same choice

755
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:02,250
I had to begin with--
to try, or not to try,

756
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,667
to take a risk,
or to play it safe.

757
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,291
And your arguments
have reminded me

758
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:10,417
how precious the right
to choose is.

759
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,667
And because I've never been
one to play it safe...

760
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,583
I choose to try.
Mr. Data...

761
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,083
program
the firing sequence.

762
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,000
Aye, sir.

763
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:32,750
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45351.9.</i>

764
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,208
<i>Doctor Moseley has met</i>
<i>with the colony leaders</i>

765
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:38,583
<i>who all agree they are willing</i>
<i>to take the risk.</i>

766
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,000
Warp power
has been rerouted

767
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,083
from the main deflector dish,
Commander.

768
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:44,542
Keep those phasers on
active surge control, Worf.

769
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,208
We're only going to get
one shot at this.

770
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,375
Well, this is it.

771
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,417
You have the sequence
locked in, Data?
Yes, sir.

772
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:53,625
After an 8.3 second
burst from the dish,

773
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:55,500
we will discharge
all E.P.S. taps

774
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,083
through the phasers.

775
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,834
It's time for you to return
to the ship, Mr. La Forge.

776
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,375
Mr. O'Brien stand by
to transport.

777
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,542
Excuse me, Captain,
but I can be

778
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:02,834
of a lot more help
down here.

779
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:04,458
We're gonna have to
compensate for

780
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:07,166
the density variations
right up to the last second.

781
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,291
Dr. Moseley's computers
can accomplish the same

782
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,500
task, sir, but I believe
Geordi would be better able

783
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,083
to anticipate
unexpected variances.

784
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,667
Mr. La Forge, you know
better than anyone that

785
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,417
there's no guarantee
that this will work.

786
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:18,959
And if it fails...

787
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,917
There's no guarantee
it's going to fail, Captain.

788
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:24,834
I'd like your permission
to remain here on the surface.

789
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:29,250
Permission granted.

790
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,625
La Forge remained below.

791
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,500
Good luck, Commander.

792
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,792
Thank you, Captain.

793
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:43,041
DATA:
The deflector dish
has been reconfigured, sir.

794
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,750
Proceed, Mr. Data.

795
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,458
DATA:
Stand by for
auto-phaser interlock.

796
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,709
Activating
deflector beam.

797
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:02,583
E.P.S. taps online.
Phasers firing.

798
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:40,208
Activating shield invertors...
now.

799
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,500
Mr. La Forge?

800
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,709
La Forge here.

801
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:08,542
Still breathing,
Captain.

802
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:10,375
MOSELEY:
We've got particulate levels

803
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,834
right where they're
supposed to be,

804
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:14,667
and the sun is shining.

805
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,500
See, Captain?
I told you

806
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,834
there was nothing
to worry about.

807
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:21,291
Report back to the ship
when you're ready, Commander.

808
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,875
Doctor, we'll stay
in orbit

809
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:26,250
and analyze the remaining
volcanic disturbances,

810
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,250
but the best advice
will be

811
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,917
to... let them cool down
on their own.

812
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:34,917
I'm getting in the habit
of thanking you, Picard.

813
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,750
Well, I'd love
to see more,

814
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,917
but it's nearly
time for me to go.

815
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:45,250
I am tickled pink
to have had

816
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,375
the opportunity
of witnessing this, Picard.

817
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,834
And you did it all
without any help.

818
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,667
Well, I must run.

819
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,750
I've got some
packing to do.

820
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,583
You know, you're taller
in person, Commander.

821
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,667
Well, would you
look at this.

822
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:23,166
Who would have expected
a teary farewell?

823
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,333
I'm afraid we're going
to have to take

824
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,000
a look inside
your vessel.

825
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,333
Curious till the end,

826
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,041
eh, Captain?

827
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,709
You can't be serious,
Picard.

828
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:34,208
We've been through this
more than once.

829
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,417
A number of objects have
been discovered missing

830
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:36,625
in the last two days,

831
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,834
and if they're
in your possession,

832
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,709
then we would
like them returned.

833
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,792
I'm not here
in search of relics.

834
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:46,542
I'm sure
they'll turn up.

835
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:48,125
If you will not
open the vessel,

836
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:52,834
I will-- with explosives,
if necessary.

837
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:54,625
I doubt you have
the means.

838
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,083
If we don't get in that thing,
I guarantee you don't either.

839
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:03,959
Considering the sensitive
nature of my equipment,

840
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:05,709
I think you'll understand
if I request

841
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:09,166
that only Mr. Data
be allowed to see it.

842
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,542
Why Data?

843
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,291
Because if I order
Mr. Data never to divulge

844
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,959
what he sees in there,
he won't--

845
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:17,583
with the exception of anything
that might belong to us.

846
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,959
Understood, sir.

847
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:24,959
Back in a minute.

848
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,834
DATA:
I do not believe
any of these items

849
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:51,166
belong to you,
Professor.

850
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:52,583
Nor does this.

851
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,417
This phaser is set at
the highest stun setting.

852
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:56,959
If I'm correct,
that is sufficient

853
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:58,667
to immobilize even you.

854
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,959
Why have you stolen
these objects?

855
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,208
To put in a museum?

856
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,667
Oh, they're far too
valuable for that.

857
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:07,709
You see, in the century
I come from,

858
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:10,041
they haven't even
been invented yet.

859
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:12,709
But this vessel, and
the temporal distortion

860
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:14,208
that coincided
with your arrival...

861
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:16,250
Oh, this<i> is</i> a time pod,

862
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,792
and it<i> is</i> from
the 26th century.

863
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:22,041
At least, that's what
the poor fellow said.

864
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:23,250
You see, he decided
to travel

865
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,041
back to
the 22nd century--

866
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,417
that's my time--

867
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,583
and he had the misfortune
of meeting me.

868
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:31,834
His clothes fit quite
well, don't you think?

869
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:35,166
It took me weeks to figure out
how to work this thing.

870
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,834
Then you are not
an historian?

871
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:38,667
Mm, more of an inventor.

872
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:41,500
Up till a few weeks ago,
a dismally unsuccessful one.

873
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,500
What are your
intentions, Professor?

874
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,959
Well, thanks
to your captain,

875
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:48,959
its seems my intentions
have changed slightly.

876
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:51,333
I was quite content
with the notion of...

877
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,500
returning with
these trinkets.

878
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,166
I'd "invent" about
one a year.

879
00:41:56,166 --> 00:42:00,750
But now, look what fortune
has graced me with.

880
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,959
You will take
a little longer

881
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,333
to figure out than
a tricorder,

882
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:07,041
but it should be
well worth the effort.

883
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,500
If the auto-timer is programmed
the way I think it is,

884
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,583
in about two minutes,
we should be on our way

885
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:15,583
back to a place
called... New Jersey.

886
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:20,041
I'm afraid you won't
be awake for the ride.

887
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,417
I assume your hand print
will open this door

888
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:29,208
whether you are
conscious or not.

889
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:35,917
That weapon was working
yesterday.

890
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:39,750
DATA:
You were right
to suspect him, sir,

891
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,250
but he is not
from the future.

892
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,750
He is from
the past.

893
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,166
Trying to make
<i>my</i> history unfold

894
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,166
in a way other than it
already has, eh, Professor?

895
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:57,333
This was all
a misunderstanding, Picard.

896
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,583
Just let me back in there.

897
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,041
We'll forget
the whole thing.

898
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,542
Now what possible incentive
could anyone

899
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:03,667
offer me
to allow that?

900
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,125
I believe you will
find all of

901
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:09,458
the missing items
in the vessel, sir.

902
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,709
Doctor...

903
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:12,917
Very nice performance.

904
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:14,917
Not all of it.
Some of it was real.

905
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,041
Captain...

906
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:22,291
He claims to be a 22nd
century inventor, Captain.

907
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,583
A pity you weren't
a bit more inventive.

908
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:26,875
If fewer things
had disappeared,

909
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,500
we might never
have suspected you.

910
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,917
As it was, the only stumbling
block was your ship.

911
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:32,625
Our sensors
couldn't penetrate it,

912
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,291
but once the door
was opened,

913
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:37,917
the computer was able
to detect and deactivate

914
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:40,500
everything you'd stolen,
including this.

915
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,000
I'd love to hear more,
Picard,

916
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,250
but I really must
get back in that pod.

917
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,667
Take him to
a detention cell,

918
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,583
Mr. Worf,
and notify Starfleet

919
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:51,291
that we'll be dropping him off
at Starbase 214.

920
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:54,333
WORF: Aye, sir.
You can't do this.

921
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,500
I've got to get back.
I don't belong here.

922
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,417
No!

923
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:05,375
I'm sure that there are
more than a few

924
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,917
<i>legitimate</i> historians
at Starfleet

925
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:11,041
who will be quite eager
to meet a human from your era.

926
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,375
PICARD:
Oh, Professor?

927
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:20,083
Welcome to
the 24th century.
