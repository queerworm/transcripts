00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:05,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45494.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:08,667
<i>We're investigating</i>
<i>a series of subspace signals</i>

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,792
<i>that may indicate</i>
<i>intelligent life</i>

4
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:13,542
<i>in the Epsilon solar system.</i>

5
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,125
<i>We are within sensor range.</i>

6
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,417
The characteristic response
to the Kriskov gambit

7
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,667
is to counter
with the El-Mitra exchange--

8
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:28,333
particularly since
I have already taken

9
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,166
both of your rooks.

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,750
By missing that opportunity

11
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,542
you have left
your king vulnerable.

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,709
We'll see.

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,500
As you wish, Counselor.

14
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,750
Check.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,417
Intriguing.

16
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,667
You have devised a completely
unanticipated response

17
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:55,458
to a classic attack.

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,208
You will checkmate my king
in seven moves.

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,667
Data, chess isn't just a game
of ploys and gambits.

20
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,750
It's a game of intuition.

21
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,917
Hmm. You are a challenging
opponent, Counselor.

22
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,834
Thanks.

23
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:16,291
But don't think a compliment's
going to get you out of our bet.

24
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:22,375
You owe me one Samarian Sunset,
made in the traditional style,

25
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,625
as only you
can make it, Data.

26
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,083
I will honor our agreement.

27
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,667
Raise your arm to the side.

28
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,417
Is that it?

29
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,750
I'm afraid so.

30
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,125
What do you think?

31
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,458
Well, it looks
like you tucked

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,667
when you should have
flattened out.

33
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,000
Something like that.

34
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,208
Turn your head
to the left.

35
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,375
Ow.

36
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:53,583
Some tearing
of the ligaments--

37
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,583
nothing we can't take care of.

38
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,166
Good.

39
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:02,792
If I remember correctly

40
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:05,041
the last time
you graced my sick bay

41
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,208
you were diving off the cliffs
of heaven on Sumiko IV.

42
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,667
Holodeck program 47-C.

43
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:10,834
Same thing.

44
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,625
Only, that time
I flattened out

45
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,041
when I should have tucked.

46
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,542
Well, as your doctor,
I would like to recommend

47
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:20,000
the emerald wading pool
on Cirrus IV.

48
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,458
It's a lot safer.

49
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,875
Navigators on this ship

50
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:25,208
have been doing flight
handling assessments

51
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,792
the same way
for years, Ensign.

52
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,834
And I found
a better way.

53
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,583
Bridge.

54
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,667
Do you mind if we discuss
changes in procedure

55
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:35,875
before you make them?

56
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:37,375
If I had to come
to you in advance

57
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:38,458
and asked you
to do it my way...

58
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,709
I might have said...
No.

59
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,500
Yes, maybe.

60
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,750
The point is,
I didn't get the chance.

61
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:48,500
The point is, with all
due respect, Commander,

62
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,709
you are trying to
turn me into your idea

63
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,208
of the model officer.

64
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,709
The rules on this ship
do not change

65
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,792
just because Ro Laren
decides they do.

66
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:07,166
WORF:
We are picking up
a subspace signal, Captain.

67
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,417
Sensors indicate
a small spacecraft ahead.

68
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,750
LA FORGE:
The configuration
is unfamiliar.

69
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,583
Nothing in our
database comes close.

70
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,917
Within visual range.

71
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,542
On screen.

72
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,041
PICARD:
Analysis, Mr. Worf.

73
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,375
No discernible armament.

74
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,792
Reading one life-form
aboard.

75
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,208
Hail the vessel.

76
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,166
No response.

77
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,333
LA FORGE:
We're being scanned.

78
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,583
And it's not like any sensor
system I've ever seen.

79
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,583
Shall we raise shields?

80
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,583
No.
Let's, uh...

81
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:43,041
let's begin this with
a show of good faith.

82
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:46,291
Sir, the scans are now
matching the frequency

83
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,458
of our optical data network.

84
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,208
It could be an attempt to
access our computer system.

85
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,709
Scanning intensity

86
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,750
has increased
by 1,500%.

87
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:57,583
Shields up.

88
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:01,166
One Samarian Sunset,

89
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,583
made in the traditional style.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,250
(ping)

91
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,834
It's beautiful.

92
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,208
I hope you enjoy it.

93
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,458
I hope you enjoy it.

94
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,375
The scanning signal
has penetrated our shields.

95
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:25,041
Computers are going down.

96
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,458
Take evasive action.

97
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,750
The helm's not responding.

98
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,959
What happened?

99
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:56,750
What the hell...?

100
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,291
I don't know
who any of you are.

101
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,709
Nor do I.

102
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,792
I don't...

103
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:20,583
I don't even
remember who I am.

104
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:01,500
PICARD:<i> </i>
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

105
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:05,375
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

106
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,375
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

107
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:11,375
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

108
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:15,709
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

109
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,208
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

110
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,500
Looks like we're all
in the same boat.

111
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:24,875
RIKER: Make that
the same starship.

112
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:27,000
But who are we?

113
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,375
What are we doing here?

114
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,333
It looks like
I'm the pilot.

115
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,333
We're not going anywhere now.

116
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,166
The helm's dead.

117
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,375
But you still know
how to work it.

118
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,333
Yes.

119
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,291
This console has
tactical configuration.

120
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,375
Yes.

121
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:58,959
Phaser power status.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,959
Intruder scan.
Torpedo guidance.

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But they do not
appear to be operable.

124
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,250
PICARD: Clearly we still possess
certain skills.

125
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,625
It would seem we know
how to operate this ship,

126
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:14,750
but our identities
have somehow been erased or...

127
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,375
or suppressed.

128
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,709
We are on the Bridge.

129
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,959
There's a good chance
this is our ship.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,875
It looks like
you're the leader.

131
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,291
WORF:
Perhaps we should not
jump to conclusions.

132
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,792
I am decorated as well.

133
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:36,667
Look, it seems to me
that determining leadership

134
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,000
is not crucial right now.

135
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:42,458
We... we need to find out
who we are and...

136
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,709
well, what we're
doing out here.

137
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,750
But how did this happen?

138
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,417
What did this to us?

139
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,375
Better still,<i> who</i>
did this to us?

140
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:55,166
I've got some intermittent
sensor readings here.

141
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,250
The scan keeps repeating itself
like it's stuck,

142
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,291
but it looks like
there's metallic debris

143
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,667
right in front of us.

144
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,709
Distance: 17 kilometers.

145
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,709
The remains
of another ship?

146
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,417
That's a good
possibility.

147
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:12,083
WORF:
Well, perhaps we were
engaged in battle.

148
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,125
If they stunned us with
some type of bioelectric field,

149
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,208
that could have
wiped out our memories.

150
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,834
Then we fired back,
destroyed them.

151
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,000
But if that presumption
is correct

152
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,583
then we could have
sustained other damage.

153
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,083
Um...
Computer, status report.

154
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,333
No voice interface.

155
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,125
No interface, period.

156
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,834
Hey, got something.

157
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:46,417
I've accessed
the basic system directories.

158
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,083
Can we get
a general status report?

159
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,291
Life support systems
throughout the ship

160
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,750
are fully operational.

161
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,500
Navigation, propulsion...
off-line.

162
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,834
What about
communications?

163
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,083
Completely disrupted.

164
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,291
That rules out
a distress signal.

165
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,458
If we even knew
where to send it.

166
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,250
Do we have an onboard
communications system?

167
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,166
We do now.

168
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,959
Well, let's use it.

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,959
This ship must have a crew.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,041
They may still have
their memories.

171
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,375
We should be careful
what we say.

172
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,500
There could be
a boarding party

173
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,625
somewhere on the ship.

174
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,417
Bridge to
all personnel.

175
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,542
Select a representative
from your group

176
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,875
to contact the bridge
and report on your status.

177
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:38,083
WORF: Remain where you are
and stay calm.

178
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,000
Bridge out.

179
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,250
Well, that
helps a lot.

180
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:45,792
Report on our status.

181
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,083
I wonder if everyone

182
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,166
is in the same condition
as we are.

183
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,041
This hurts.

184
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:05,291
How's that?

185
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,667
Thanks.

186
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,333
I didn't even think.

187
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,542
I just picked it up
and knew how to use it.

188
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:16,125
At least I have an idea
of what I'm doing here.

189
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,709
But what about me?

190
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,667
I mean, I'm a patient
in a bathing suit.

191
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,291
That doesn't say much.

192
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,250
No, it doesn't.

193
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:34,625
Do you have any
clothes around here
I could borrow?

194
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:39,625
At least until I figure out
where the swimming pool is?

195
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:44,083
RO:
The network appears to be
inducting the power

196
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,667
with electromagnetic
conduits here

197
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,667
located along each turboshaft.

198
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,250
We've heard from all decks.

199
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,625
There are over
a thousand people on board.

200
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:58,792
Everyone's had
their memories affected

201
00:11:58,834 --> 00:11:59,959
in the same way we have.

202
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,083
I have just
completed a survey

203
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,583
of our tactical systems.

204
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,000
We are equipped
with ten phaser banks,

205
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,417
250 photon torpedoes,

206
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,250
and a high-capacity
shield grid.

207
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,500
We're a battleship.

208
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,291
Yes, it appears so.

209
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,250
This turbolift system gives us
access to the rest of the ship.

210
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,834
That sounds like
the next logical step.

211
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,041
We should start with
the most crucial areas first.

212
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,917
Main engineering--

213
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,417
Deck 36.
I'm on my way.

214
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,917
Oh, wait a minute.

215
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,041
We've got to coordinate
our efforts here first.

216
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,959
I just need
to<i> do</i> something.

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,792
Look, I feel the
same way, we all do,

218
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,917
but if anything's
going to get done...

219
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,709
I know. I just...

220
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,834
it's really an ugly feeling.

221
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,125
I don't like being
so out of control.

222
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,583
Well, we're going to have
to depend on each other

223
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:44,375
if we're going to
get through this, okay?

224
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:45,458
Okay.

225
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,917
We're going
to search the ship.

226
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,875
Very well.
Proceed.

227
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,333
LA FORGE:
I'll go with you.

228
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,917
I want to get my hands
on the computer core--

229
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,959
see if we can reestablish
control from there.

230
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:08,375
I've accessed the optical data
network for the computer core.

231
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:10,959
I can monitor every system
that's routed through here.

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,166
Warp and impulse drives

233
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,834
are reading
within tolerance levels,

234
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,959
and so are the tactical arrays--
defensive and offensive.

235
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,583
Everything looks
functional.

236
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,125
Now, if we could just
access the control systems,

237
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,375
we could get them
up and running.

238
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,250
According to these
schematics,

239
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,333
the engineering computer core
access is down that corridor.

240
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,875
Weapons, propulsion,
and shields are the priorities.

241
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,041
We could be in danger
of another attack.

242
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,583
That's where I'll start.

243
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,709
We'll begin our crew survey
on decks five through ten.

244
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,208
When you get
those systems going,

245
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,542
try to pull up
the personnel files.

246
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,041
It would be nice
if we all had names.

247
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,083
All right?
Good luck.

248
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,375
Yeah. You, too.

249
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,792
So far, our survey teams
have found

250
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,917
no deaths or injuries
among the crew.

251
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,709
Shuttlecraft
are all operational

252
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,166
as are the transporters.

253
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,291
But no one they've
talked to knows any more

254
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,291
about their identities
than we do.

255
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,417
Engineering is working

256
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,458
on accessing
the control systems.

257
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,583
As soon as the ship
is operational

258
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,417
we must make it
combat-ready.

259
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,917
Well, I would recommend

260
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,542
that, before we
prepare for combat,

261
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,208
we try to access
the ship's logs--

262
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,959
find out who we are.

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What our purpose
here might be.

264
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,000
Well, I disagree.

265
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,000
We must first make ourselves
ready for battle.

266
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,750
That is the highest priority.

267
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,250
LA FORGE:
Engineering to bridge.

268
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,458
Go ahead.

269
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,125
I've regained control

270
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,125
of navigation, propulsion,
weapons and communications.

271
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,542
We should be able
to tie them into the bridge

272
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,959
in just a few minutes.

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,875
Well done.

274
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,125
Now we are ready.

275
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,875
Question is...
for what?

276
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,000
The phasers
are operational.

277
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,667
We now have full
tactical control.

278
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,959
We should run
a complete diagnostic

279
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,333
on all command systems.

280
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,500
A full diagnostic
would require us

281
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,542
to take our
systems off-line.

282
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,041
We would be defenseless.

283
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,792
If we're going to trust
our lives to these systems,

284
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:08,250
we should be certain
that they're not going to fail.

285
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,583
The computer
was damaged.

286
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,709
Some processors
might still be down.

287
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,875
Proceed with the diagnostic.

288
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,709
What have you found, Doctor?

289
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,000
Not much.

290
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,500
The brain scans
I've run are unusual,

291
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,750
but there's no damage
to the hippocampus--

292
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:33,291
that suggests that we still
have our long-term memories,

293
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,208
but somehow they're
being blocked.

294
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,583
PICARD:
Is it possible to bypass

295
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,125
these normal pathways?

296
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,500
To get at these memories
some other way?

297
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:40,917
That's what I'm hoping.

298
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,500
What I need now is to see

299
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,792
some normal brain scans
for comparison.

300
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,166
Is there any chance I can
get the crews' medical files?

301
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,625
No, we are currently running
a full diagnostic.

302
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,667
Computer resources
are limited.

303
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,750
The medical records
are our next priority.

304
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,250
Thank you.

305
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,166
I guess these are my quarters,
but I don't remember anything.

306
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,166
If it's any
comfort, we're all

307
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,625
in the same situation,
so stay put for now.

308
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:11,917
We'll be back in touch.

309
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:14,041
Okay, sir. Thanks.
WOMAN: I'm really sorry.

310
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,709
That's all I need
for now.

311
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:19,917
Well... that's it

312
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,083
for the living
quarters on this deck.

313
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,125
What's next?

314
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,750
It's a large room up ahead
called "Ten-Forward."

315
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:29,083
Let's go.

316
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,417
So, if everything
were back to the way
it was supposed to be,

317
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,125
what do you think you'd
be doing right now?

318
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,917
I'd be having more fun

319
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,959
than searching
the ship, I'd imagine.

320
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,125
Fun?

321
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,750
Well, with that holodeck
we just saw,

322
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:42,917
I think I could conjure up
an interesting program or two.

323
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,083
Now, that's
disappointing.

324
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,041
Why?

325
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,333
You don't strike
me as a man

326
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,542
who needs a holodeck
to have a good time.

327
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,000
(<i> concerned conversations</i> )

328
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,500
Who reported to the bridge
from this group?

329
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:57,583
TROI: I did.

330
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,125
Have you found out anything

331
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,500
that might give us some insight
into what happened?

332
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:01,834
Not specifically,

333
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,291
but there are two things
that seem unusual.

334
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,458
The bartender

335
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,291
is an artificial life-form.

336
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,166
Can I get you something?

337
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,250
A beverage?

338
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,125
No, thank you.

339
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,834
I'm fine.

340
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,458
Your memories
are gone as well?

341
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,709
The data banks
that identify who I am

342
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,291
are not functioning.

343
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,792
You were going to mention
something else.

344
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:29,542
TROI:
I don't know if
it means anything,

345
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,166
but I seem to have an ability
that the others don't.

346
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,875
I have a very strong sense

347
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:37,500
of what other people
are feeling.

348
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:40,500
At times, it's almost...

349
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,792
Is something wrong?

350
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:45,875
No...

351
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:48,500
Just for a moment,
you seemed familiar.

352
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:50,291
You remember me?

353
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,333
Not exactly.

354
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,250
I mean, I don't know
who you are

355
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,250
but there's
something about you.

356
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,959
WORF:
Bridge to survey team.

357
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,709
Survey team here.
Go ahead.

358
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,000
We have accessed
the personnel files.

359
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,750
Report to the bridge
immediately.

360
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,875
We're on our way.

361
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,166
Computer, give me
a biographical listing

362
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,750
of all personnel

363
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:22,291
responsible for the primary
operation of this ship.

364
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,125
COMPUTER: A full biographical
listing is not available.

365
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:29,166
Is there any list
of the ship's senior officers?

366
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,375
The crew manifest
is available.

367
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,667
That's better than nothing.
Give me the crew manifest.

368
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:39,417
Commanding Officer,
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

369
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:44,417
Executive Officer,
Commander Keiran MacDuff.

370
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,625
Second Officer,
Commander William Riker.

371
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:51,750
Operations Officer,
Lieutenant Commander Data.

372
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:57,000
Chief Medical Officer,
Dr. Beverly Crusher.

373
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:01,041
Ship's Counselor, Lieutenant
Commander Deanna Troi.

374
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:05,625
Chief Engineer, Lieutenant
Commander Geordi La Forge.

375
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:10,709
Security Chief,
Lieutenant Worf.

376
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,792
Helm Officer, Ensign Ro Laren.

377
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,625
Commander...<i> MacDuff,</i>

378
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,125
have the other officers listed
here report to the bridge.

379
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,166
Aye, sir.

380
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,208
Your next priority
will be to retrieve

381
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,709
any information you can
about this ship's mission.

382
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,417
Contact the operations
officer to assist you.

383
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,667
Aye, sir.

384
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:39,041
He's in Ten-Forward--
waiting tables.

385
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,709
Captain.

386
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,959
I regret my
recent behavior.

387
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,500
I assumed an attitude
of authority

388
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:51,834
that was... unwarranted.

389
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,959
Mr. Worf, we're all doing
the best we can

390
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,125
in a difficult situation.

391
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,500
Think nothing more of it.

392
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,083
Thank you, Captain.

393
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,083
We haven't finished a full
search of the computer records

394
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,709
but we have found out
quite a bit.

395
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,417
This vessel is called
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

396
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,333
We are part
of an organization

397
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,875
called the United
Federation of Planets.

398
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,583
The Federation is currently
in a state of war.

399
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,917
With whom?

400
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,542
LA FORGE:
The Lysian alliance.

401
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,166
They're a genocidal race
determined to destroy us.

402
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,542
The war has been
going on for years.

403
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,041
DATA:
Starfleet Command believes

404
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,875
the Lysians
are using a new weapon

405
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:33,917
which has shifted the balance
of power to their favor.

406
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,250
Over the last two months,

407
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,834
14 Federation vessels
have been captured,

408
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,500
apparently very easily,

409
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:40,667
their crews held captive
on Lysia.

410
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:42,458
What do we know
about this weapon?

411
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,792
DATA: Our scientists
theorize the Lysians

412
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,875
are using an energy wave--
either plasma-based

413
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:50,417
or a subspace
interference pattern.

414
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:54,375
The weapon severely disrupts
a starship's computer system

415
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,417
as well
as the mental functions

416
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,417
of its crew.

417
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,166
That's what
happened to us?

418
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,291
Mr. La Forge, do we
have any record

419
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,625
of our current mission?

420
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:03,750
Yes, sir.

421
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,417
We are approximately here.

422
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,667
We've been ordered
to cross into Lysian territory

423
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,792
and destroy
their central command.

424
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,792
This is it-- the nerve center

425
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:24,250
for the entire
Lysian military operation.

426
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,375
Captain, there's been
a great deal of damage

427
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:28,875
to our computer system.

428
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:31,542
Maybe we're not getting
the correct information.

429
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,792
What are you saying?

430
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,583
That we get confirmation
of this mission

431
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,083
from our headquarters.

432
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,208
If we use subspace radio,
we will be detected.

433
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,208
There could be
thousands of lives at stake.

434
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,166
Our orders
specifically require us

435
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,000
to maintain radio silence.

436
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,375
DATA:
Our mission is part

437
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:50,375
of a highly
coordinated effort

438
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:51,625
to put an end to the war.

439
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,709
There are other vessels
on other fronts,

440
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,041
all working according
to an intricate plan.

441
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,542
We're the linchpin
to the operation.

442
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,959
If we don't destroy
the central command

443
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,709
the entire effort will fail.

444
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,834
He's right, Captain.

445
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:04,917
Our choice is clear.

446
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,542
Commander MacDuff,
set a course

447
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,083
for the Lysian
central command.

448
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,875
These are your quarters.

449
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,166
Thanks for your help.

450
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:32,291
Come in for a minute?

451
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,667
Recognize anything?

452
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,709
It's like it belongs
to someone else.

453
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:00,750
Nothing feels right.

454
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:03,417
This room, this ship...

455
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:07,458
most of all,
this war we're fighting.

456
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,709
I don't imagine
war ever feels right.

457
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,375
I suppose that's true.

458
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,959
What is it?

459
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,041
That same feeling.

460
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,000
You seem familiar.

461
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,125
You're the only thing
that does.

462
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:29,917
Can you remember anything
specific about us?

463
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:32,208
I don't know.

464
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:47,083
It's... it's more like
remembering an emotion--

465
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,000
feelings that you're
somehow associated with.

466
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,834
I hope they're
good feelings.

467
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,834
Yes, they are.

468
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:01,625
This entire situation
is a little bit unnerving.

469
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:02,834
It's been a long day.

470
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,709
We've all been
through a lot.

471
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,583
We certainly have.

472
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,250
I'll see you tomorrow.

473
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,542
Good night.

474
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,041
(<i> paper rustling</i> )

475
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,500
Hi.

476
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:47,709
I know I didn't get
the wrong room.

477
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,750
I just didn't like the way
my quarters were decorated.

478
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:53,834
Besides,
I have this funny feeling

479
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,792
that maybe I spend
most of my off hours here.

480
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,542
Really?

481
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:10,667
For all we know, you
and I could be married.

482
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,083
For all we know,
you and I could hate each other.

483
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,000
Sort of exciting,
isn't it?

484
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,959
We just don't know.

485
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,500
We might regret this.

486
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:20,750
Regret what?

487
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,291
Aren't you being
a little presumptuous?

488
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,250
Like I said,
I just didn't like

489
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:28,875
the way my quarters
were decorated.

490
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:30,959
Maybe we should
switch quarters.

491
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,125
Maybe we should stay right
here and see what happens.

492
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:39,458
What if I snore in my sleep?

493
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,542
What makes you think you're
going to get any sleep?

494
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,375
WORF:
Captain, we have crossed
the Lysian border.

495
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:54,917
PICARD:
Take us out of warp, Ensign.

496
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:55,959
Go to three-quarters impulse.

497
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,375
Yes, sir.

498
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:58,959
Mr. Worf, maintain
a continuous sensor sweep.

499
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,500
Aye, sir.

500
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:03,500
How long till we reach
their central command?

501
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:06,583
At our current speed,
approximately 37 hours.

502
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,875
Captain, I am picking up
a vessel directly ahead.

503
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:11,792
Can you identify
it, Mr. Data?

504
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:14,000
The ship matches
the Starfleet description

505
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,750
of a Lysian destroyer,

506
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:19,375
a short-range attack vessel
with disrupter-style weapons

507
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,125
and a standard crew of 53.

508
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,458
Within visual range.

509
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,667
On screen.

510
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,208
WORF:
The destroyer is
increasing its speed.

511
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,917
They are moving
to intercept.

512
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,458
Evasive maneuver
sequence Delta.

513
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,625
RO:
Yes, sir.

514
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,166
They are matching
our maneuvers.

515
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,166
Activating
phaser arrays.

516
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,834
Ready to fire, sir.

517
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,166
Stand by.

518
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,667
Captain, our orders

519
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:49,500
were to destroy
all Lysian warships.

520
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:51,875
I'm aware of that, Commander.

521
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:53,750
Tactical analysis, Mr. Data.

522
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:56,375
The destroyer
has minimal shields.

523
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:57,917
Their disrupter capacity

524
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:00,667
appears to be
only 2.1 megajoules.

525
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:02,250
They're no match
for the<i> Enterprise.</i>

526
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:05,083
Captain, the destroyer
is hailing us.

527
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,667
Open a channel.

528
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,625
No! Their new weapon--

529
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,959
whatever it is that erased
our computers and our memories--

530
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,875
maybe this is how they do it--

531
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:15,250
over communication channels.

532
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,792
It is conceivable, sir.

533
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:20,291
It's also possible
they just want to talk to us.

534
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,250
I think we should respond.

535
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,750
Captain, the ship
is hailing us again.

536
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,542
If you're wrong,
it could mean our destruction.

537
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,166
We can't take the risk, Captain.

538
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,500
DATA:
The Lysians have stopped
transmitting, Captain.

539
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:32,333
They are powering up
their disrupters.

540
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,834
They have locked onto us, sir.

541
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:35,750
Full shields.

542
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:36,792
WORF:
Shields up.

543
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:37,959
(<i> laser blast</i> )

544
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,083
Captain?

545
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:44,875
Return fire.

546
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:53,667
WORF: The ship
has been destroyed.

547
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:55,709
Maintain this
course, Ensign.

548
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,917
Three-quarters impulse.

549
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:57,917
RO: Yes, sir.

550
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,709
Well done, Captain.

551
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,166
The Lysian central command
would have received

552
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,041
any transmission from
the destroyer by now.

553
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:19,000
They're going to be
on alert.

554
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,250
RO: I recommend
a randomly vectored approach

555
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,875
to our target.

556
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,417
It would be our best chance
of avoiding any sort of pursuit.

557
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,041
Agreed.

558
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,792
Doctor, the success
of this mission

559
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:30,542
would be much more likely if
we could get our memories back.

560
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,709
Is there anything
you can do?

561
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,041
I found several cases
resembling our condition

562
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,291
in the medical index.

563
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,750
The causes are different

564
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:40,041
but the cure is similar
in each case.

565
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,333
Could the same
treatment work for us?

566
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:43,834
That's what I'm hoping.

567
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,333
It involves
increasing the activity

568
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,834
of the medial temporal region
of the brain.

569
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,875
Using short-term
memory synapses

570
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,458
to retrieve
long-term memory.

571
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,792
When can you start?

572
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:55,959
As soon as our medical files
become available.

573
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,083
It would be dangerous to attempt
treatment without them.

574
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:00,000
Mr. La Forge?

575
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,583
Data and I ran
into a little trouble

576
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,333
accessing the medical file areas
of the computer,

577
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,709
but, with a little time,

578
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,333
I'm pretty sure
we'll be able to get there.

579
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,041
Three hours, maximum.

580
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,333
Proceed.

581
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,166
I don't get it.

582
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,917
I'm still hitting
a file wall.

583
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,709
There appears to be
a command path discontinuity.

584
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,875
I shall attempt to rewrite
the locator subroutine.

585
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,083
You must have been
one hell of a bartender.

586
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,375
You know, it's too bad there
aren't more of you around.

587
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:40,583
We could certainly
use the help.

588
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:42,375
Yes.

589
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:46,125
I wonder why you're
the only one on board.

590
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:48,542
I have expended
considerable thought

591
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:51,750
with respect to my apparent
uniqueness among the crew.

592
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,000
Any conclusions?

593
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,542
Several possibilities
suggest themselves.

594
00:29:55,583 --> 00:30:01,250
I may represent an entire race
of artificial life-forms.

595
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,417
If so, there may be
a home planet

596
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:03,834
for others of my kind--

597
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,041
a shared history
and a culture

598
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,875
of which I am not
presently aware.

599
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:10,875
Then again, you could
have been built just
for this ship.

600
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:13,041
I have considered
that possibility as well.

601
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,333
It may also be the case

602
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,291
that every starship
in the Federation

603
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,166
is equipped with an artificial
life-form such as myself.

604
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,583
Hmm.

605
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:22,083
If that's true,
maybe you all look alike--

606
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,667
a standard-issue android.

607
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:25,875
Hard to construct, so only
one allowed per vessel.

608
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,208
There is another possibility.

609
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,583
Perhaps my origin is unique.

610
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,542
In that case, I am alone.

611
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,834
(<i> console beeping</i> )

612
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,834
We have accessed
the information storage area.

613
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:42,917
Considerable damage has been
done to the files themselves.

614
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,792
The mission
reports are gone.

615
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:47,750
DATA:
As well as the crew records
and the personal logs.

616
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,542
So are
the medical records.

617
00:30:58,709 --> 00:31:00,667
(<i> door chimes</i> )

618
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:01,750
Come in.

619
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:07,625
I'm restless.

620
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:10,667
Mind if I visit
for a while?

621
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:11,834
Please.

622
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,208
What's wrong?

623
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,208
Everything.

624
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,959
Every time I think about
this war, our mission,

625
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,291
I feel a sense of panic,

626
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:25,875
like a hand's closing
around my throat.

627
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,542
You're never going to feel
good about this war--

628
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:31,542
none of us will-- but we've
got to complete our mission.

629
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,834
I've been doing
a little research--

630
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:38,750
trying to find out more
about William T. Riker.

631
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:40,333
What have
you discovered?

632
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:42,709
He's a musician,
for one thing.

633
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,166
(<i> plays jaunty melody</i> )

634
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,375
Very impressive.

635
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:50,500
No one was more
surprised than I.

636
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,917
So, what else has your
research uncovered

637
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,291
about William Riker?

638
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,959
He's athletically inclined.

639
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,458
Loves to climb mountains.

640
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,792
He's from somewhere
called Alaska.

641
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:03,500
Enjoys exotic food...

642
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:07,792
and takes his vacations
on a planet called Risa.

643
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:09,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

644
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,834
<i>Ode to Psyche,</i>
by John Keats.

645
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,917
Open it.

646

"To Will.

647
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:22,000
All my love,
Deanna."

648
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,166
That may explain

649
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,834
some of the familiar
feelings we have.

650
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:36,000
I don't know
what to think.

651
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,917
(<i> door chime</i> )

652
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:44,458
Come in.

653
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,166
Counselor.

654
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,375
Ensign.

655
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,667
Am I interrupting
anything?

656
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:56,542
BOTH: No.

657
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:00,417
I was just visiting.
Um...

658
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:01,875
We'll talk again
soon, Commander.

659
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:04,000
Of course.
Thank you, Counselor.

660
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:07,041
Bye.

661
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:10,834
And what was
all of that about?

662
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:15,583
Oh... we were just discussing
the situation we're all in.

663
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,125
Mm-hmm. Good...

664
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:18,333
because I have a feeling

665
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:21,375
that I used to be
the jealous type.

666
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:34,333
What bothers me, Captain,
is how specific this damage is.

667
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,166
Any records
of a personal nature,

668
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:38,417
any files that could
tell us about who we are--

669
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,208
those are the ones
that are gone.

670
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,375
That's a little too selective
to be coincidence.

671
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:44,875
As selective as what was
done to our own memories.

672
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:46,500
Skills are still in place,

673
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,417
but personal knowledge
is unavailable.

674
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:49,792
It is consistent
with what we know

675
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:51,834
about the new
Lysian weapon.

676
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,291
Doctor, is it
absolutely necessary

677
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,291
to see the medical files
to attempt treatment?

678
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:59,208
It would be dangerous
to do without them.

679
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,417
It's a risk I think
we have to take.

680
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,542
He's right, Captain.

681
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,500
I volunteer for
the procedure.

682
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:12,333
CRUSHER:
That's strange.

683
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:15,000
The diencephalic activity
is exactly the same.

684
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:18,125
There should be<i> some</i> increase.

685
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,959
Let's try broadening
the bandwidth.

686
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,542
Go to 30.1.

687
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,625
Raise the frequency as well.

688
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:28,083
Increase it by 33%.

689
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,917
Something's wrong
with the sequencing program.

690
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,667
Keiran? Keiran?

691
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,125
I'm all right.

692
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,750
I'm all right.

693
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,041
What happened?

694
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,500
I don't know.

695
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:51,500
Something went wrong
with the sequence initiator.

696
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:56,166
We're lucky
we didn't lose you.

697
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,375
Did any of this work?

698
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:00,208
Do you remember anything
more about yourself?

699
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,709
No.

700
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,500
I'm sorry, doctor.

701
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:05,959
Back to square one.

703
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,792
Come.

704
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,458
You wanted to
see me, Captain?

705
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,458
Yes, Commander.

706
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,667
Please come in.
Sit down.

707
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,333
I find myself having...

708
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:27,583
grave concerns
about our mission.

709
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,917
Concerns as-as
to its success?

710
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,458
No, no, no.

711
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
More fundamental doubts.

712
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:35,250
Whether or not it
can be justified.

713
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,917
I've been asking myself
the same thing.

714
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:41,959
I'm sure our superiors feel
their orders are justified.

715
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,834
Orders we can't
even verify.

716
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,959
Orders we can't ignore.

717
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,875
But I also can't ignore

718
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,917
that we have
greatly outclassed

719
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:55,000
the one enemy vessel
we've encountered

720
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:58,291
and that every single,
possible shred of information

721
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,834
which might shed some light
on this situation

722
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,625
has been conveniently
eliminated.

723
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:05,417
I feel as though
I've been handed a weapon

724
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:09,834
sent into a room,
and told to shoot a stranger.

725
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:12,458
Well, I need
some moral context

726
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,250
to justify that action.

727
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:19,041
And I don't have it.

728
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:21,333
I'm not content
simply to obey orders.

729
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,917
I need to know that
what I'm doing is right.

730
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,583
So do I.

731
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:26,834
I'd feel a lot better

732
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,917
if all the questions
were answered

733
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,875
and if you want
to abandon our mission

734
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:32,750
until our memories return,
that's your choice

735
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:37,208
but...
I must ask you...

736
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,417
is it right to risk
prolonging this war--

737
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:43,417
to allow the needless deaths
of thousands on both sides--

738
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:46,834
solely on the basis
of our moral discomfort?

739
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:04,667
(<i> door chimes</i> )

740
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:06,291
Come.

741
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,000
Lieutenant.

742
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,875
You wished
to see me, sir?

743
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,083
I did.

744
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,083
Please.

745
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:19,500
Memory or no, it seems clear

746
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:23,083
that both you and I
were born for battle,

747
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:25,458
more so than the others.

748
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,125
I thought this as well.

749
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:28,208
It's conceivable

750
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,500
that that is the very reason

751
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:33,208
that we have been assigned
to this vessel.

752
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,291
The<i> Enterprise</i>
has science officers,

753
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:38,917
medical specialists, engineers.

754
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:43,834
Our captain is undoubtedly
an accomplished diplomat.

755
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:47,542
But we...
we are the warriors.

756
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,333
There are times
for diplomacy.

757
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,083
This is not
one of them.

758
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,333
You are concerned
about the captain.

759
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,959
I am concerned about
completing our mission

760
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,291
and ending this war...

761
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:01,500
in victory.

762
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:08,750
We may soon face
a critical moment.

763
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:10,083
The success
of our mission

764
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:13,750
may hang on
a split-second decision.

765
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,083
A hesitation
would kill us all

766
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,625
and those
that are counting on us

767
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:21,000
would surely die as well.

768
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:23,917
We cannot let this happen.

769
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,500
That'll be all.

770
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,208
We are entering
the Lysian system, sir.

771
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,166
Slow to one-quarter
impulse.

772
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,458
Yes, sir.

773
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,959
The central command
is directly ahead--

774
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,500
still beyond weapon range.

775
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,417
Red alert.
Battle stations.

776
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:58,417
Bring us to an attack posture,
Mr. Worf.

777
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,917
WORF:
Aye, sir.

778
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:02,417
Sensors show several
objects in our path, sir.

779
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,750
They are 29 meters in
length and are unmanned.

780
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,375
According to Starfleet records,
they're sentry pods

781
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:09,208
programmed to defend
their central command.

782
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,583
I read 47 of them
around the perimeter.

783
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:13,500
Tactical analysis, Mr. Data.

784
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:14,834
The pods are equipped

785
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,000
with fusion-generated
pulse lasers

786
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,125
and minimal shielding.

787
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,625
Not much power there.

788
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,625
Forward shields to maximum.

789
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:24,458
Lock phasers
on the sentry pods.

790
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,000
PICARD: Prepare
to return fire.

791
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,041
Shields up.

792
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:29,166
Phasers locked on targets.

793
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:31,125
Full impulse.

794
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:33,667
Take us straight through.

795
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,625
We are through
the perimeter, sir.

796
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,375
That was too easy.

797
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,041
WORF:
We have yet

798
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,083
to encounter
any battleships.

799
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,709
They may lie ahead.

800
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,375
Load all torpedo bays.
Ready phasers.

801
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:55,500
WORF:
Aye, sir.

802
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:08,583
Approaching central command.

803
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:11,583
Mr. Data,
scan for defenses.

804
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,291
I am picking up
no vessels,

805
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,041
no additional
sentry pods.

806
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:21,542
RIKER:
Optimal firing range

807
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,959
in 55 seconds.

808
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,291
Phaser banks ready.
Loading torpedoes.

809
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,709
What are
the defensive capabilities

810
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,041
of the central command?

811
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,875
Armaments consist
of four laser cannons

812
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:33,709
and 39 cobalt
fusion warheads

813
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,166
with magnetic propulsion.

814
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:38,417
Defensive shield output
is 4.3 kilojoules.

815
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:42,208
One photon torpedo
ought to do it.

816
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,333
Data, how many people
on that station?

817
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,625
15,311.

818
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:49,667
We're within range,
Captain.

819
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:51,834
Stand by.

820
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:53,709
Waiting on
your orders, sir.

821
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,875
Captain, this isn't right.

822
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:58,667
The rest of our forces
are depending on us.

823
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,291
How could our mortal enemy

824
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,875
be over 100 years behind us
in weapons technology?

825
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:05,834
Their battleships may be
on their way right now.

826
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,417
We must attack!

827
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,208
I do not fire on
defenseless people.

828
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,333
Mr. Worf, open a channel
to the Lysians.

829
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,458
Belay that order!

830
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,083
There's something wrong
with the captain.

831
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,250
I'm taking command
of this vessel.

832
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:22,792
Fire all weapons!

833
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,208
Mr. Worf.

834
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,125

836
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:59,083
<i>We are on a course</i>
<i>to Starbase 301.</i>

837
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,500
<i>Dr. Crusher</i>
<i>has been working steadily</i>

838
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:04,458
<i>and has restored the memories</i>
<i>of most of the crew.</i>

839
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:09,667
The Lysians have identified
"Commander MacDuff"

840
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:11,667
as a Satarran--
an alien race

841
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:14,667
that's been at war
with the Lysians for decades.

842
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:17,667
I have...

843
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,834
I've conveyed our deepest
regrets to the Lysians

844
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:23,041
over the tragedy
of their lost ship and crew.

845
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,750
With all the power
that MacDuff had

846
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:30,125
to alter our brain chemistry
and manipulate the computers,

847
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:32,375
it's hard to believe
he needed the<i> Enterprise.</i>

848
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,166
The Satarran weapons technology

849
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:37,500
was no more advanced
than the Lysian.

850
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:40,792
One photon torpedo
would have ended their war.

851
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:43,417
It almost did.

852
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:48,583

856
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,333
I was hoping
to run into you.

857
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:15,750
Please, sit down.

(<i> groans</i> )

859
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,041
Well, I'm glad I ran into the...
the two of you.

860
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:28,000
When you have no memory

861
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:30,041
of who you are
or who anybody else is,

862
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,458
you find yourself...

863
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,959
The counselor tells me
that at times like that

864
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,458
we might do the things that
we've always wanted to do.

865
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,291
She said that?

866
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:44,458
It's psychologically
valid.

867
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,583
RO:
Commander, don't
worry about it.

868
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,542
As far as I'm concerned,

869
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:56,166
you and I have shared something
that we will treasure forever.

870
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:13,125
Well, I'm a little confused.

871
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:16,458
Well, if you're
still confused tomorrow,

872
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,375
you know where my office is.
