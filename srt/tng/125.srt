00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,834
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41775.5.</i>

2
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:09,542
<i>We are en route to the ocean</i>
<i>world of Pacifica.</i>

3
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:12,041
<i>While our mission</i>
<i>is scientific in nature</i>

4
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,917
<i>we look forward</i>
<i>to the warm, blue waters</i>

5
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:17,500
<i>and fine beaches that make</i>
<i>Pacifica a jewel of the galaxy.</i>

6
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:19,625
...so the guy staggers
to his feet

7
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:21,500
and goes back
to the girl, right?

8
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:25,458
Well, she smiles, looks him
straight in the eye and says

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,709
"just try that in hyperspace."

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,709
(<i> laughing</i> )

11
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,500
I see.

12
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:37,458
So the difficulty in attaining
such complex positioning

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,041
in zero gravity environment

14
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,709
coupled with the
adverse effects

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,166
it would have on the
psychological well-being

16
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,500
of the average human male

17
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:45,709
is what makes this anecdote
so amusing.

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,875
Yes, very humorous indeed.

19
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:50,875
Hysterical,
in fact.

20
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:56,667
(<i> forced laughter</i> )

21
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,542
(<i> chuckling</i> )

22
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,083
What is our E.T.A.
at Pacifica, Mr. La Forge?

23
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:11,083
22 hours,
14 minutes, sir.

24
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,542
Increase to warp six.

25
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,458
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir, full impulse.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,875
Do you think
anyone would object

27
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:17,291
to our arriving
ahead of schedule?

28
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,041
I know I won't.

29
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,875
I've been really looking
forward to a nice swim.

30
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:23,542
DATA:
You are aware, Counselor,

31
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,959
that the holodeck
can be programmed

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,709
to recreate
an oceanic environment.

33
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,458
Data, it's just
not the same.

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,417
Have you ever been for
a real moonlight swim?

35
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,750
One can swim in moonlight?

36
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,375
How about you,
Mr. Worf?

37
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,250
Swimming is too much like...

38
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,625
bathing.

39
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:46,166
(<i> console beeping</i> )

40
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,542
Commander Riker...

41
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,375
I'm receiving a Code 47.

42
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:51,583
Verify.

43
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,917
It<i> is</i> Code 47, sir.

44
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,917
Starfleet emergency frequency.

45
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,792
Code 47?

46
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,458
Captain's eyes only.

47
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,083
RIKER: Captain, I'm
sorry to disturb you.

48
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,834
Yes, Number One, what is it?

49
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,875
An incoming message.

50
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,125
Code 47, sir.

51
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,959
Pipe it through.

52
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,834
COMPUTER:
This is an emergency communiquÃ©.

53
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,667
It is not to be discussed
with fellow officers

54
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:21,166
unless deemed
absolutely necessary.

55
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,250
There will be
no computer record

56
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,959
of said transmission.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,542
Understood.

58
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:30,291
COMPUTER: Proceed with
voice print identification.

59
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,625
Picard, Jean-Luc.

60
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,375
Captain, USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

61
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,417
(<i> screen hums</i> )

62
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,583
Voice print verified.

63
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,166
Walker.

64
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,542
Hello, Jean-Luc.

65
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,417
It's been a long time.

66
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,250
Too long, old friend.

67
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,709
Why are you contacting me
on this frequency?

68
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,333
It was a difficult decision.

69
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,834
I felt it was worth the risk.

70
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,333
Risk?

71
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,959
It's about Starfleet.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,083
About something we've always
considered to be impossible.

73
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,375
I don't understand.

74
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,583
I can't explain it now.

75
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,917
We need to talk face-to-face.

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,250
You're using a Code 47.

77
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,083
I have to know
what all this is about.

78
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,041
Not over subspace. No.

79
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,250
Oh, for God's sake, Walker,
this is a secured channel.

80
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,834
No!

81
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:25,792
I want you to meet me
on Dytallix B.

82
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,041
When?

83
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,500
Immediately.

84
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,750
No, not possible.

85
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,959
We're expected at Pacifica.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,291
That can wait.

87
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,166
You owe me.

88
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:39,083
And you owe it to yourself
to hear what I have to say.

89
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,750
Something is beginning.

90
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:45,333
Don't trust anyone.

91
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,166
Remember that, Jean-Luc.

92
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,083
Don't take anything for granted.

93
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,500
Walker...

94
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:51,834
Dytallix B.

95
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,500
We'll be waiting.

96
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,291
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

97
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:29,667
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

98
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

99
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:35,458
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

100
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,041
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

101
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,917
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

102
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,875
Data, are you familiar
with Dytallix B?

103
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,750
Dytallix B is one of seven
uninhabited planets

104
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,834
mined for the Federation
by the Dytallix Mining Company.

105
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,375
It is in the nearby
Mira System.

106
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,750
Mr. La Forge, chart a course
for it immediately, warp 7.

107
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,667
And there will be
no records

108
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,750
or logs mentioning
any aspect

109
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,333
of this diversion.

110
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,959
RIKER: Captain, they're
expecting us at Pacifica.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,709
Shouldn't we contact them
and let them know?

112
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,959
Negative.
Nothing goes out

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
without specific orders
from me.

114
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,959
Hopefully, the delay...

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
will be minimal.

116
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,000
(<i> beeping, buzzing</i> )

117
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,583
I have the readout
on Dytallix B, Commander.

118
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,959
What have you got?

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,333
Dytallix B is
the fifth of six planets

120
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,667
circling the red giant
known as Mira.

121
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,750
One side always
faces the sun

122
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,333
where temperatures reach
up to 180 degrees.

123
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,041
The mines line
the temperate zone

124
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,834
between the day
and night sides

125
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,250
but they are
long deserted.

126
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,291
Why the devil are we
going to this planet?

127
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,583
Are there any miners

128
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,792
or indigenous life-forms
on the planet?

129
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,417
I believe the answer
to both questions is no, sir.

130
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,709
In a manner of speaking

131
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,750
it is nothing
but a lifeless hunk of rock,

132
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,917
a useless ball of mud,
a worthless chunk...

133
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,583
Thank you, Data.
I get the idea.

134
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,500
Captain, we are approaching
Dytallix B.

135
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:37,375
PICARD: Very good,
Number One. I'm on my way.

136
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,834
WORF:
Captain...

137
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,333
sensors are detecting
three Federation starships

138
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,125
already in orbit
around the planet.

139
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,542
Identify.

140
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,959
Two are
frigates.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,041
The<i> Renegade,</i>
commanded by Tryla Scott

142
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,875
and the<i> Thomas Paine,</i>
Captain Rixx commanding.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,500
DATA: The third is just
coming into range now, sir.

144
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:09,125
It is Ambassador-class,
heavy cruiser

145
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,917
USS<i> Horatio.</i>

146
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,542
<i>Horatio?</i>

147
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,792
Isn't that
Walker Keel's ship?

148
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:17,250
Attempts at communication

149
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,917
have been ignored
by all three vessels.

150
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,333
Make no further attempts,
Mr. Worf.

151
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,125
Any life-form readings
on the surface, Data?

152
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,333
Three, sir.

153
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,333
All gathered inside
what appears to be

154
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,417
the entrance
to a mining tunnel.

155
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,375
Very well.

156
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:34,250
Relay those coordinates
to the Transporter Room.

157
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,709
I'm beaming down.

158
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,166
RIKER:
Alone, Captain?

159
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,291
Alone, Number One.

160
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,083
(<i> wind howling</i> )

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,834
Thanks for coming.

162
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,083
This is some greeting,
old friend.

163
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,500
Tell me, Jean-Luc.

164
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:00,250
Where did we
first meet?

165
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,250
Answer the question.

166
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,542
Tau Ceti III.

167
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,250
It was a bar...

168
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,000
quite an exotic one,
as I remember.

169
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,250
What do I win?

170
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,166
Do you recall the night

171
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,083
you introduced Jack Crusher
to Beverly?

172
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,333
You know full well
that I hadn't met Beverly then.

173
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,208
<i>You</i> introduced them.

174
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,875
My brother introduced them.

175
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:32,625
You don't have a brother--
two sisters, Anne and Melissa.

176
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,333
What the hell
is all this about?

177
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,875
(<i> sighs</i> )

178
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,875
Apologies, Captain.

179
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:44,625
We had to be sure
you were really you.

180
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,792
Walker, what is going on?

181
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,542
Captain Picard,
meet Captain Rixx.

182
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,959
I believe we've met--

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,792
the Altarian Conference.

184
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,291
And Captain Scott.

185
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,542
Tryla Scott.

186
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,041
It's said you made captain

187
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,000
faster than anyone
in Starfleet history.

188
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,709
Present company included.

189
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,875
Are you that good?

190
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,834
Yes, I am.

191
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,625
Starfleet's finest.

192
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,583
Fancy meeting you here.

193
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:20,417
We all came secretly, Picard,
to discuss the threat.

194
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,083
What threat?

195
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,792
Have you noticed anything
about Starfleet Command lately?

196
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,291
Anything unusual?

197
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,166
No, but we've been
on the outer rim for a while.

198
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,667
We haven't had much contact
with them.

199
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:35,959
Some of us have seen
strange patterns emerging.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,542
Unusual orders.

201
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,458
High ranking officials
backing irrational proposals.

202
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,875
Starbase 12 was completely
evacuated for two full days.

203
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,959
No explanation given.

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,208
SCOTT:
And what about the deaths?

205
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,458
McKinney...

206
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,458
Ryan Sipe,
Onna Karapleedeez.

207
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:58,125
All dead?

208
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,458
SCOTT:
A series of accidents.

209
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,375
WALKER:
Or so they say.

210
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:02,792
It's hard to be
certain of anything.

211
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:05,792
Interfleet communications
are at a minimum.

212
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,458
But something
is happening.

213
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,667
And we fully expect
the<i> Enterprise</i>

214
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,166
to be targeted soon.

215
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,583
Targeted for what?
By whom?

216
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,250
WALKER:
We're not sure yet.

217
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,834
Damn it, Jean-Luc, I tell you

218
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,625
that some of Starfleet's
top command people are changing.

219
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,667
This could affect the very
core of our organization.

220
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,792
Officers I've known for years
are bluffing their way

221
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,417
through talk
of old times.

222
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,375
That's their weakness--
a lack of memory.

223
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,041
He doesn't
believe us.

224
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,959
He thinks
we're crazy.

225
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,083
You've given me nothing
to believe in.

226
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,000
Just a lot of vague talk
about strange patterns.

227
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,291
Irrational proposals.

228
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,500
Who's behind this,
and to what purpose?

229
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,667
How are people being changed?

230
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,375
I can't say exactly,

231
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,041
but I think it's spread
to my own ship.

232
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,750
My first officer
hasn't been the same

233
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,625
since we stopped off at Earth.

234
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,583
Our medical officer says
he's perfectly normal

235
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,041
but I don't think
I trust him either.

236
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,291
Walker...

237
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,792
We know we don't have
all the answers.

238
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:12,291
All we ask is that
you keep your eyes open.

239
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,834
That's sound advice
at any time, Captain.

240
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,500
Stay in touch with us.
Covertly.

241
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,917
This meeting
never took place

242
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,709
as far as Starfleet
is concerned.

243
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:29,709
Please, I'm asking this
as a personal favor.

244
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,959
I'm glad, Jean-Luc.

245
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,625
I'm glad
you're still one of us.

246
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,959
Tell Beverly I...
I said hello.

247
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,875
RIXX:
And watch your back, Picard.

248
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:20,208
Friends-- close friends--
are few and far between.

249
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,625
Two of the oldest
and closest

250
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:25,125
are Jack Crusher--
may he rest in peace--

251
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,041
and Walker Keel.

252
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,166
Before various missions
spilt us up,

253
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,291
we were virtually
inseparable.

254
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,583
I trust Keel completely.

255
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,625
If he felt it necessary
to violate regulations,

256
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,125
he must have had
a very good reason.

257
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,458
But you're putting your career
at risk for him.

258
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,333
Friendship must dare to risk,
Counselor,

259
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,750
or it's not friendship.

260
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:47,291
They illicitly used

261
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,000
the emergency channel
to draw you here.

262
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,875
Then they ask you
to keep secrets

263
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,542
from your
superiors--

264
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,709
effectively, to disobey
Starfleet regulations.

265
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,625
The people involved in this
are of the highest caliber.

266
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,125
If I didn't believe
in their loyalty,

267
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,792
I wouldn't have
gone this far.

268
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,250
Don't you think you should
tell the rest of the crew?

269
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:08,417
No. I don't want to
risk implicating them...

270
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,041
not until I have
solid evidence

271
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,625
that something
really is wrong.

272
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,125
Take us out of orbit,
Mr. La Forge.

273
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,542
Aye, sir.

274
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,625
Resume heading to Pacifica,
warp factor eight.

275
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,583
Aye, sir, warp eight.

276
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,208
At that speed, we should arrive

277
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,500
9.63 hours behind
the original schedule, sir.

278
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,709
Very good. Data, I have
an assignment for you--

279
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,125
one specifically suited
to your talents.

00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,500
Computer, this is

282
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:48,250
Please access

283

PICARD:
Doctor?

287
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,750
I understand
the<i> Horatio</i>

288
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:15,291
was seen in orbit
around Dytallix.

289
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,834
Did you see Walker?

290
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,625
No.

291
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:21,750
Oh, I would have loved
to have seen him.

292
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,667
It wasn't possible, Doctor.

293
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:26,917
Captain, I am picking up
an unusual disturbance

294
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,041
in the nearby quadrant.

295
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,875
Confirmed, sir.
Sector 63.

296
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:34,250
Specify.
What kind of disturbance?

297
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,375
Hard to say
at this distance, sir.

298
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,625
I guess the trip
to Pacifica will have to wait.

299
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,041
Uh-huh.

300
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,250
Let's investigate.

301
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,291
Maintain speed.
Alter course accordingly.

302
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:50,542
Aye, sir, changing course to
three-five-one, mark four.

303
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:05,041
Approaching Sector 63, sir.

304
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,792
Slow to impulse.

305
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:11,583
Aye, sir,
going to impulse power... now.

306
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,917

On screen.

308
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:22,208
Doesn't look natural.

309
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,208
Agreed.

310
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,000
Enlarge and identify.

It looks like...

312
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:33,834
debris from a space vessel
of some kind.

313
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,834
It could be one of those ships
that was orbiting Dytallix.

314
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,000
We are in close proximity
to that planet.

315
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,333
Identifying marks, Mr. Worf?

316
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,291
Nothing so far.

317
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:57,333
Sensors not detecting
any bodies in the flotsam.

318
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,250
But from the amount
of the wreckage...

319
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,208
I'm sorry, sir.

320
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,375
It can only be the<i> Horatio.</i>

321
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,667
From the looks of it,
she's been totally destroyed.

on the<i> Horatio</i> was sabotage.

359
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:07,333
But if we can't
be certain...

360
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,250
DATA:
Perhaps we can.

361
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,875
My orders were to search

362
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:13,959
for abnormal patterns
in Starfleet's directives.

363
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,417
I believe I have found
just that.

364
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,291
These are various
outposts and starbases

365
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,083
where I have detected
unusual activity

366
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,542
over the past few months.

367
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,542
What sort of activity?

368
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,458
An uncustomary reshuffling
of personnel--

369
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,083
usually in the command areas.

370
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,458
The new officers
have had frequent contact

371
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,959
with the highest levels
of Starfleet Command.

372
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,792
Why hasn't anyone
discovered this before?

373
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,166
The orders were given
with great subtlety.

374
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,542
To use an aphorism:

375
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,083
Starfleet's left hand
did not know

376
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,208
what its right hand was doing.

377
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,041
Data, can you speculate
as to the purpose

378
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,709
of these reassignments?

379
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,000
I believe it is
a clandestine attempt

380
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,125
to control vital sectors
of Federation territory.

381
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,458
(<i> sighs</i> )

382
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,125
This could be a prelude
to an invasion.

383
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,000
But who's behind it?

384
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,834
There's insufficient data
to make such an assessment, sir.

385
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,208
Are you suggesting

386
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,709
that we warp over to
Starfleet Headquarters

387
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,959
and demand to know
what's going on?

388
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:19,125
Why not?

389
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,208
PICARD:
Yes, why not?

390
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,834
We're talking about a threat

391
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,959
to the entire future
of the Federation.

392
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't think any of us
can rest easy

393
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,291
until we've been to the source.

394
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,458
<i>Captain's Personal Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

395
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,875
<i>While it is quite unusual</i>

396
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,500
<i>for a starship</i>
<i>to return to Earth,</i>

397
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:40,375
<i>we seem to be left</i>
<i>with no other choice.</i>

398
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,375
<i>I have apprised</i>
<i>the remaining bridge crew</i>

399
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:44,041
<i>of our situation.</i>

400
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,083
Approaching
Earth, Captain.

401
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,542
Standard orbit,
Mr. La Forge.

402
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,417
Standard
orbit, sir.

403
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,291
Any word from Starfleet
Command, Data?

404
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,333
Nothing
so far, sir.

405
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,917
Strange.

406
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,208
(<i> console beeps</i> )

407
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,291
Captain, I am now
receiving a message

408
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,166
from Starfleet
Command.

409
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,834
On screen.

410
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,333
Greetings,<i> Enterprise.</i>

411
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,959
I am Admiral Savar.

412
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
This is Admiral Aaron.

413
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:36,083
And I believe you already know
Admiral Quinn.

414
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,458
Yes, indeed. It's good
to see you again, Admiral.

415
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,208
And you, Captain.

416
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,709
Of course,
we are always delighted

417
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,417
when the<i> Enterprise</i> returns
to the nest.

418
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,375
Yet we are puzzled
by the timing of your visit.

419
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:49,792
Yes, sir, I can imagine
that you would be.

420
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:51,458
AARON:
Governor Delaplane of Pacifica

421
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,041
informs us
that you canceled

422
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,625
your scheduled stop there.

423
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,417
Is this true?

424
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,625
Yes, sir, it is.

425
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,542
Explain yourself,
Captain.

426
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,250
Why have you
returned to Earth?

427
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:06,041
I would rather discuss that
in person, Admiral.

428
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,041
Excuse us for one moment,
Captain.

429
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,250
They seem
normal enough.

430
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,875
On the surface.

431
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:31,125
Counselor,
any thoughts?

432
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,875
Hard to say.

433
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:34,458
Someone is
hiding something,

434
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,291
but I can't tell
who or what.

435
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,750
I must say I'm not overjoyed
to see Remmick again.

436
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,041
Considering
what we've done,

437
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,583
their response has been
pretty temperate.

438
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,125
I don't like it.

439
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,083
You can't trust them.

440
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,750
SAVAR: Forgive the delay,
Captain Picard.

441
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:51,041
We'd be delighted
if you and your first officer

442
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,333
would join us for dinner.

443
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,667
Yes, delighted.

444
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:55,166
It would give you
a good opportunity

445
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,500
to expatiate
your own viewpoint.

446
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:58,959
To elaborate upon
whatever it is

447
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,083
that's troubling you.

448
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,166
Thank you, we accept
your gracious offer.

449
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,417
SAVAR:
Excellent.

450
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,333
Preparations are
already underway.

451
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,166
We'll greet you in the
reception area in say...

452
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,500
20 minutes?

453
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:12,875
Splendid.

454
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,625
QUINN: I won't
be able to attend

455
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,208
the dinner, I'm afraid,

456
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,709
but I would like
to see the ship

457
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,375
and say hello
again, Captain.

458
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,875
Of course.

459
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,375
We look forward
to seeing you, Admiral.

460
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,083
<i>Enterprise</i> out.

461
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:33,208
Quinn wants
to see us alone.

462
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,291
At least we know
<i>he's</i> still on our side.

463
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,917
Mr. Data,
you have the Bridge.

464
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,208
Aye, sir.

465
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,208
(<i> seagulls calling</i> )

466
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:15,500
Are you ready to beam up
to the<i> Enterprise,</i> sir?

467
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:18,250
Yes, Commander.
Quite ready.

468
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,500
Energize,
Mr. Remmick.

469
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,458
Welcome aboard,
Greg.

470
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,417
Good to see you.

471
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:52,709
You remember
Commander Riker.

472
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,667
Hello again,
Commander.

473
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:56,500
I must say,
you're looking remarkably well.

474
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,625
Never felt better
in my life.

475
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,333
When you were here last,

476
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,375
you were saying that you
were feeling tired.

477
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:05,583
Tired of life I was,
but not anymore.

478
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,417
I'm ready
for new challenges now.

479
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:10,041
What about another look
at this ship?

480
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:19,625
Remember what you told me
back at Relva VII?

481
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:21,750
About the threat
that you perceived

482
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,625
to the very fabric
of the Federation?

483
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,417
Is that why you're here,
because of what I said?

484
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,959
It's one of
the reasons, yes.

485
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,500
But Jean-Luc...

486
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,375
you took me
far too literally.

487
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:32,792
I was only referring
to the problems involved

488
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:36,333
in assimilating new races
into the Federation.

489
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:39,208
It's an ongoing,
tumultuous process

490
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,625
which can cause
stress and strain

491
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:44,542
on every aspect
of our alliance.

492
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,375
I'm sorry.
I must have misunderstood.

493
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:49,083
It's not for you to apologize.

494
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,667
If I led you up
the garden path

495
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,083
I humbly ask
your forgiveness.

496
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,959
Of course.

497
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,166
Now, gentlemen,

498
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:57,500
you have a dinner
to attend to

499
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,166
and I would like
to go and freshen up

500
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,208
before I look around
a little bit more.

501
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,041
We've arranged
your usual accommodations, sir.

502
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,542
Well, that's outstanding.

503
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:08,375
Yes, I should be getting
down to the planet.

504
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,834
Commander Riker will
be available here

505
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,709
to show you anything
that you want to see.

506
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,458
It's really
not necessary.

507
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,000
Oh, I insist.

508
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:17,917
When you've finished
showing the admiral

509
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,250
anything that he needs,

510
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:20,625
you can join me
down on Earth.

511
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,792
I may want to stay
a while, Jean-Luc.

512
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,041
Of course.

513
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,875
Stay as long
as you wish.

514
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,500
No.

515
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:42,667
That's not
Gregory Quinn.

516
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:43,959
It may look like him
and sound like him

517
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,208
but it isn't him.

518
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,458
Are you absolutely
certain, Captain?

519
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,083
I'm certain,
Number One.

520
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,959
Now, I want you
to stay close.

521
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,291
Keep your eye on
his every move.

522
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,250
Have... have Beverly
concoct some reason

523
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,959
for giving him a full
medical examination.

524
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
How?

525
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,083
I don't know.
Just do it.

526
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,208
He's a senior admiral.

527
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,250
It's not him, Will.

528
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:02,625
I know that now.

529
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,375
What I have to find out
is how this has happened

530
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,333
and who or what
is behind it.

531
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,750
Captain,
if you're right...

532
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:09,166
I'm right.

533
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,583
Should you be beaming
down there alone, unarmed?

534
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,959
I'll take care.

535
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,583
Find out what you
can, then join me.

536
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,041
In force, if necessary.

537
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,333
Energize.

538
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:19,375
Good luck, sir.

539
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,583
Welcome home,
Captain Picard.

540
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,959
Thank you.

541
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
My first officer
will be joining us shortly.

542
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:44,583
Yes, I'm sure he will.

543
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,667
You've met Commander
Remmick, haven't you?

544
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:49,917
Under less than
ideal circumstances.

545
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:52,667
It's nice to see
you again, Captain.

546
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:55,333
We have prepared a
special meal in your honor.

547
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:56,834
Delightful.

548
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,000
Tell me, why is
the corridor so quiet?

549
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:02,041
The last time I was here,
it was bustling with activity.

550
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,750
It usually is.

551
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,333
Tonight's
a quiet night.

552
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,375
Yes.

553
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:09,375
A quiet night.

554
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:15,709
(<i> door chimes</i> )

555
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,875
Ready for your
tour, Admiral?

556
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:21,709
Quite ready,
Commander.

557
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,500
What's in the case?

558
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:26,291
Actually, I brought it
for Dr. Crusher.

559
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:29,291
But perhaps you would
like to see it first.

560
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,417
What is it?

561
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:31,750
A form of life.

562
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,667
It was discovered accidentally
by a survey team

563
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,500
on an uncharted planet.

564
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,250
Why haven't we heard
anything about that?

565
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,291
Oh, you'll be hearing
about it shortly,

566
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,834
but first, there remains much
scientific study to be done.

567
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:46,333
After all, it<i> is</i>
a superior form of life.

568
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,291
Superior?

569
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,417
Totally.

570
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,458
Come, have a look.

571
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
I think I'll summon
my science officer.

572
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,333
It won't like
your science officer.

573
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,333
It<i> does</i> like you!

574
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:02,375
Vitamins-- they do
wonders for the body.

575
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,834
(<i> groans</i> )

576
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:24,917
Riker to Security,
Guest Quarter 17.

577
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:25,875
Emergency.

578
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,208
(<i> menacing chuckle</i> )

579
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:54,583
Let's have some Andonian tea
while we wait for your Riker.

580
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:57,333
Then you can tell us
about what's brought you here.

581
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,583
I see you keep up
with our duty roster.

582
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,959
Yes, of course, Captain.

583
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,333
The<i> Enterprise</i>
is very important to us.

584
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,917
Excuse me,
gentlemen.

585
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:11,500
To the<i> Horatio,</i>
gentlemen.

586
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:12,834
The<i> Horatio.</i>

587
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,709
What an awful tragedy.

588
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,917
Such a terrible loss of life.

589
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,125
It's interesting that
you should mention the<i> Horatio.</i>

590
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:27,250
It's one of the subjects
I wanted to discuss.

591
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:29,083
AARON:
Really?

592
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:32,250
Has the cause of her destruction
been ascertained?

593
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:35,667
Absolutely.
Implosion.

594
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:39,041
Due to the extreme
negligence of her captain.

595
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,667
Enjoy, Picard.

596
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:43,583
I believe you'll find it
an excellent<i> aperitif.</i>

597
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,208
QUINN:
It's a good thing you're here.

598
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,000
He slipped and
hit his head.

599
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:09,583
This is Lieutenant La Forge
in Guest Quarter 17.

600
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,125
We have a medical emergency.

601
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,542
Your Dr. Crusher
is most capable.

602
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:14,041
I'm sure he'll
be all right.

603
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,792
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

604
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,750
my time here
is most limited.

605
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,542
Admiral...

606
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:20,709
Don't you think
we should wait

607
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,375
till the doctor gets here?

608
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:32,542
Now, Klingon,
it's between you and me.

609
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:52,625
(<i> growls</i> )

610
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:59,709
Do Klingons fear death
as much as humans?

611
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,959
I could snap your
neck in a second,

612
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,125
but it wouldn't be as much fun.

613
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,333
(<i> groaning</i> )

614
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,750
Ooh!

615
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,125
Are you all right?

616
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:33,083
Oh, if I could see,
I'd be seeing stars.

617
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,125
What<i> is</i> he?

618
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:44,625
Let's find out.

619
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,875
Retinal scans
are an exact match.

620
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,291
It really is Quinn.

621
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,834
How can that be?
The man picked me up

622
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,625
like a rag doll.

623
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,250
I'm going to have to do
a complete internal scan.

624
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,083
Keep me posted, Doctor.
I'll be on the Bridge.

625
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:20,417
What is that?!

626
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,917
What do you know
of conspiracies, Captain?

627
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:34,750
Not nearly enough,
I suppose.

628
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,834
That's the charming thing
about them, isn't it?

629
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:40,291
When a machination is real,
no one knows about it.

630
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:44,125
And when it's suspected,
it's almost never real.

631
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,250
Except, of course,
in paranoid delusions

632
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:49,417
for those
who believe.

633
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,375
Sorry to interrupt.

634
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:52,792
Dinner is served.

635
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:54,542
Wonderful.
Bantering with the captain

636
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,000
has given me quite an appetite.

637
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,750
I need to contact
my ship

638
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:59,959
to let Commander Riker know
that we're about to sit down.

639
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,625
Of course,
Captain.

640
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,041
We'll wait for you
at the table.

641
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:15,458
Picard to Riker.

642
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,583
Dr. Crusher here, Captain.

643
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,583
May I speak freely?

644
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,834
I suppose I have little choice.
Where is Riker?

645
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,875
He was attacked by Quinn.

646
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,917
Or what we thought was Quinn.

647
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,375
Specify, Doctor.

648
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:33,792
A parasitic being
has invaded Quinn's body.

649
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:37,041
It has complete control
over all brain functions.

650
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:40,041
It seems to breathe
through a small gill

651
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,667
protruding from the back
of Quinn's neck.

652
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:44,333
Look for this, Captain.

653
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,834
I believe it will be visible

654
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:49,000
on anyone
who has been compromised.

655
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,750
Any idea of what it is
or where it came from?

656
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:53,333
Negative, I've never seen
anything like it before.

657
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,083
(<i> beep</i> )
DATA: Lieutenant Worf,

658
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,834
if the situation
is under control,

659
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,542
please report to the Bridge.

660
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,542
Doctor?

661
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:00,792
It's okay.

662
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:04,041
He won't be waking up
for a long time.

663
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:05,750
Continue, Doctor.

664
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,542
By the placement
of the tendrils,

665
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,709
the parasite appears
to stimulate

666
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,583
the victim's adrenal glands,
generating great strength

667
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:14,959
and resistance to the...

668
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,917
Never mind the details.
Can you remove it?

669
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:18,625
I don't think so.

670
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:21,333
Not without killing the patient.

671
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:26,834
Captain, you must set
your phaser on kill.

672
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,875
Stun has little effect.

673
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:34,709
Doctor, one does not beam down
to Starfleet Headquarters armed.

674
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:40,166
Your food
is getting cold, Captain.

675
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,166
I'm going
into dinner now, Doctor.

676
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:48,333
Tell Commander Riker to join me
as soon as he's ready.

677
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,458
Picard out.

678
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,125
(<i> gasps</i> )

679
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,166
Please, sit down,
Captain.

680
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,917
We've been waiting.

681
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,125
Go ahead and start, Captain.

682
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,250
We don't stand on ceremony here.

683
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:25,000
(<i> groans</i> )

684
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,250
Oh, do eat up, Picard.

685
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,625
Raise your hand
if you want seconds.

686
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,500
Riker, thank God.

687
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:17,875
We're leaving.

688
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:20,083
You're not going anywhere.

689
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,875
You'll be one of us soon.

690
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:30,709
You were meant
for the doctor.

691
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,166
It couldn't be helped.

692
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,875
Riker walked in on us
unexpectedly.

693
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,917
No matter.

694
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:42,083
The doctor will be
joining us soon.

695
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,625
All in good time.

696
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:51,166
SAVAR:
Well, Captain Scott, good.

697
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:53,625
Now, the setting is complete.

698
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,542
You don't really think
we were in the dark

699
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,458
about your intentions,
do you?

700
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,583
SAVAR: Patience is one of
our virtues, Captain.

701
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,000
We didn't
go after you.

702
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,667
We allowed you to come after<i> us.</i>

703
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,250
More dramatic that way,
don't you think?

704
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,625
Yes, the one thing
both races share

705
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,125
is a love
of theater.

706
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:20,166
And you've put
on a fine show.

707
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,375
What race are you?

708
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,750
Where are
you from?

709
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:24,125
SAVAR:
It's not important.

710
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,959
Let us just say

711
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,875
we've come a long way
to join you.

712
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:30,500
It's a perfect match.

713
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:33,041
We're the brains.
You're the brawn.

714
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:35,208
You'll understand soon, Picard.

715
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,959
SAVAR:
Indeed.

716
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,834
We've been moving slowly,
cautiously for many months now.

717
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:42,166
Careful to cover
our tracks,

718
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,083
careful not to
arouse suspicion

719
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,083
until it's too late.

720
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,667
And now, it's too late.

721
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:48,750
For you, that is.

722
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:50,125
Well said, brother.

723
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,709
Picard and Riker
control the<i> Enterprise,</i>

724
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,959
which means<i> we</i> control
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

725
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,875
Eat hearty, brother.

726
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:01,083
Relish your new body.

727
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,000
(<i> groaning</i> )

728
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,208
Aaron!

729
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,542
Aaron!

730
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:52,625
(<i> yelling</i> )

731
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,792
(<i> high-pitched beeping</i> )

732
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,500
Can I help you, gentlemen?

733
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,250
Is there any
trouble here?

734
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:28,166
Perhaps if you'd tell me
what it is...

735
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,792
Remmick...

736
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,875
No, Will.

737
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:06,333
You don't understand.

738
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:10,250
(<i> gurgling</i> )

739
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,709
We mean you no harm.

740
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:26,083
We seek peaceful co-existence.

741
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,834
(<i> shrill screeching</i> )

742
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:16,625
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41780.2.</i>

743
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:18,750
<i>How difficult after all</i>
<i>these years of learning</i>

744
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:21,750
<i>to respect life,</i>
<i>to be forced to destroy it.</i>

745
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:24,083
<i>But there seems to be</i>
<i>no alternative.</i>

746
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,667
<i>Admiral Quinn is expected</i>
<i>to make a full recovery.</i>

747
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:28,250
<i>There is no trace</i>
<i>of the parasite</i>

748
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:30,208
<i>which took control of him.</i>

749
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,709
<i>We'll never know</i>
<i>how many of these life-forms</i>

750
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,291
<i>infiltrated Starfleet</i>

751
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,417
<i>but it seems</i>
<i>they could not survive</i>

752
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:37,834
<i>without the mother creature</i>

753
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:40,458
<i>which had taken over</i>
<i>Commander Remmick.</i>

754
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,083
It was Dr. Crusher's idea
to simulate the blue gill.

755
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:46,250
We had to make sure it would
fool everyone, including you.

756
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,083
That it did, Number One.
Rest assured.

757
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,750
DATA:
Captain?

758
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:52,417
I have attempted to trace
the message Remmick was sending.

759
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:53,709
I believe
it was aimed

760
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,792
at an unexplored
sector of our galaxy.

761
00:43:56,959 --> 00:43:59,041
Any idea
what the message was, Data?

762
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,458
I believe
it was a beacon.

763
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,166
A beacon?

764
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:07,750
Yes, sir.
A homing beacon.

765
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:10,125
Sent from Earth.

766
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:28,875
(<i> high-pitched beeping</i> )
