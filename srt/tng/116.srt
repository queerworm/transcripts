00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:05,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41309.5:</i>

2
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:08,083
<i>We are in orbit</i>
<i>around Persephone V</i>

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,458
<i>where I have been sent</i>

4
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,709
<i>to confer</i>
<i>with Admiral Mark Jameson</i>

5
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:14,917
<i>in regard</i>
<i>to an extraordinary situation.</i>

6
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:18,125
Starfleet received
this subspace transmission

7
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,583
two days ago, Admiral.

8
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,125
Let's see it, Captain.

9
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,417
On viewer.

10
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,959
I am Karnas,
governor of Mordan IV.

11
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:32,959
A dissident group
of terrorists have taken

12
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:36,750
Federation Ambassador Hawkins
and his staff hostage.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,083
They will not
discuss terms with me.

14
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,458
This is a crisis
I cannot resolve.

15
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:46,166
The terrorists are demanding
a Federation negotiator.

16
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,208
I feel there is
only one negotiator

17
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,750
with the skills
to resolve this situation.

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,000
The lives of the hostages
will depend

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,667
on Starfleet delivering
this man to Mordan--

20
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,875
Commander Mark Jameson.

21
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,959
<i>Admiral</i> Jameson.

22
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:04,875
The terrorists have given you
six Earth days

23
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:09,750
to bring him here
or the hostages will die.

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,792
PICARD:
Starfleet cannot
understand

25
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:14,208
how or why this crisis
has developed.

26
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,083
Mordan IV has finally
gained peace

27
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,834
after decades
of civil war.

28
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,750
40 years of civil war, Captain.

29
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,083
Yes, sir.

30
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,166
Karnas was largely responsible

31
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,166
for the planet's unification
and peace.

32
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,834
Why should he now
be unable to deal

33
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,125
with this rebellious faction?

34
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,125
45 years ago

35
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:37,125
I negotiated a hostage situation
on Mordan, Captain.

36
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:42,041
Karnas was a young man then,
but so was I.

37
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:45,250
He seems to feel that I can
handle the situation again.

38
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,083
I'm detailed to take you
to Mordan IV

39
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,291
as soon as you
can be ready, Admiral.

40
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:54,333
My wife and I will beam aboard
at 1500 hours, Captain.

41
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,917
Acknowledge.

42
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:57,417
Received and acknowledged, sir.

43
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,417
Picard out.

44
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:00,792
Nearly 1500 now, sir.

45
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,333
Well, Number One

46
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,166
let's go and welcome
the Admiral aboard.

47
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:19,792
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

48
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:22,834
This is my executive officer,
Commander William Riker.

49
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:23,834
My pleasure, sir.

50
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:24,875
Ma'am.

51
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,333
My wife, Anne.

52
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:31,208
Captain, there are certain
details of this mission

53
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,792
that you should understand
before we begin.

54
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes, sir.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,625
I am not simply
an advisor.

56
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,834
On any assignment
I accompany

57
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:42,041
Starfleet has designated me
Senior Mission Officer.

58
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,458
I control the away team
and all its actions.

59
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,458
Is that understood?

60
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,083
Of course, Captain

61
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,875
you command the ship

62
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,208
but the mission is mine.

63
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,834
I trust you are
in full agreement.

64
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,250
Yes, sir.

65
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,709
Of course.

66
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,083
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

67
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:29,291
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

68
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,208
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

69
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:35,041
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

70
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:39,750
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

71
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,291
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

72
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,166
Message coming in
from Mordan, sir.

73
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:59,041
Put it on the
screen, Mr. Data.

74
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,959
Mordan IV to<i> Enterprise.</i>

75
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,959
This is Karnas.

76
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,792
I will speak to the Captain.

77
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,750
I am Captain Picard

78
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,375
commanding
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

79
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,750
Is Admiral Jameson on board?

80
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,333
He's here beside
my First Officer.

81
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,500
Do you wish to
speak to him now?

82
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,583
So, Jameson, I see time
has not been kind.

83
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,417
It seldom is, Karnas.

84
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:25,583
However, we could save
a good deal of it now

85
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,750
if you'll outline
the terrorists' demands.

86
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,166
They insist

87
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,750
all discussions will take place
here on Mordan.

88
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,000
They refuse to speak to me--
only to a Federation mediator.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,458
They say
they will brook no excuses.

90
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,750
If there are any offered

91
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,375
your ambassador
and his people will die...

92
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,792
...unpleasantly.

93
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,250
I believe them.

94
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,000
So should you, Admiral.

95
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,375
Tell them I accept
the conditions of negotiation.

96
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,375
I will do so immediately.

97
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,875
For a man in his position

98
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,166
he doesn't seem to know much
about the situation.

99
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,625
Wrong, Number One.

100
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,208
He told me that the terrorists

101
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,500
are desperate enough to kill
if they are crossed.

102
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,875
They are willing
to talk one on one

103
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,625
but not to him.

104
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,041
Counselor?

105
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,000
From his body language

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,875
as well as
his words and tone

107
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,375
I judge that what
Karnas said was honest

108
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,583
but I sensed
a holding back.

109
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,959
Perhaps he knows more
about the terrorists

110
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,458
than he's prepared to admit.

111
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:37,583
Possible, but I suspect
it's closer to the mark

112
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:41,041
if we said
he doesn't want to admit

113
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,542
failure of his own
efforts to negotiate.

114
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,417
He is
a proud man.

115
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:47,875
That could be, sir.

116
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,083
Karnas has established
himself as a powerful man

117
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,500
on Mordan.

118
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,333
Suddenly, in this situation,
his power is useless.

119
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,000
BEVERLY:
Sick Bay to Bridge.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,375
I'm ready
for Admiral Jameson now.

121
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,208
In a few moments, Doctor.

122
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,125
Ready for what, Captain?

123
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,625
It's just a routine
medical checkup.

124
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,750
Ship's regulations.

125
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,333
What I don't
understand, sir

126
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,500
is how Karnas knew
that you were still available.

127
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,375
Still alive,
you mean.

128
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,625
So far as he knew, sir,
you could have been dead.

129
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,041
Quite right, Commander,
but I am not

130
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,333
and I imagine Ambassador Hawkins
has told him that.

131
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,500
I briefed the ambassador
about Mordan

132
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,208
before he left
to take up residence.

133
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,250
PICARD:
All right, Karnas
has a problem

134
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,834
he thinks you
can resolve.

135
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,208
What do the terrorists need

136
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,667
that Karnas can't
or won't give them?

137
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:48,041
DATA:
Mordan's had peace
for five years.

138
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,333
They have finally come
to a state of productivity

139
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,458
which satisfies
their planetary needs

140
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,208
but no more than that.

141
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,000
Perhaps the dissidents
feel the Federation

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,375
could provide them with more.

143
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,500
JAMESON:
I have negotiated
many treaties

144
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,250
on many planets, Picard.

145
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,208
I have found that peace
or the appearance of it

146
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,333
is often a prelude to war.

147
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,000
Admiral, are you suggesting

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,500
the terrorists want arms
and weapons?

149
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,208
They may.
I am suggesting that Karnas

150
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,875
is the last man to give them
such weapons.

151
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,375
TROI:
I see. You believe
that Karnas

152
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,125
would not negotiate
on that point

153
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:27,083
and so the terrorists demanded
an outside negotiator.

154
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,792
I know Karnas.
He is a warrior.

155
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,041
He lives for challenge.

156
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,125
These people have
insulted his honor

157
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,542
by taking the embassy
staff hostage.

158
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,250
Now, I'll negotiate

159
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,917
but I'll have to be very careful
in dealing with Karnas.

160
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,750
He'll want revenge

161
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,333
for that insult.

162
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,417
(<i> beeping</i> )

163
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:57,041
Well...

164
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,208
About time.

165
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,959
Couldn't get away
from the Bridge?

166
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,792
Didn't want to.

167
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,959
Feels good to be
on one again.

168
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,625
I'm glad, Mark.

169
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,583
You want me
to help you up?

170
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,333
(<i> groaning</i> )

171
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,917
You're stronger today.

172
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,208
I'm fine.

173
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,125
I feel like a kid again.

174
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,834
This ship is
magnificent.

175
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:33,250
It even has
family quarters.

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,583
Pity we didn't have them
20, 30 years ago.

00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:42,250
We could have been together
almost all of your career.

182
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,250
Mark!

183
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,208
I'll get Sick Bay.

184
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,250
No. No.

185
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,375
There's no need.

186
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,792
It's happened
before.

187
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,125
When?

188
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,959
You haven't said anything.

189
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,417
It'll pass.

190
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,458
Just give me
a moment.

191
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,125
See, I'm... I'm better.

192
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,458
It's going away.

193
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,542
What is it?

194
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,375
Do... the doctors know?

195
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,458
Just body changes.

196
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,583
Last checkup

197
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,959
they said I... I'd
have to expect it.

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,875
You're sure?

199
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,875
Don't lie to me.

200
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,959
I'm sure.

201
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:32,583
Oh...

202
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,083
All the medical information
the Admiral provided

203
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,458
is satisfactory, sir.

204
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,875
Excellent, Doctor.

205
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,542
Except for one thing.

206
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:43,792
The test results he gave me
aren't two days old.

207
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:45,333
They're two months old.

208
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,792
The medical records coder
always includes the date

209
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:49,500
as part of the file number.

210
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
He lied to me, sir,
and I don't know why.

211
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:56,333
He is 85 years old, Doctor.

212
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,083
For some, the memory begins
to fail.

213
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,166
He suffers
from Iverson's disease, sir.

214
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,417
That affects the body

215
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,583
not the mind.

216
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,750
Now, I have a gut feeling
he's hiding something.

217
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:07,917
Now, that is an observation

218
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,875
I would expect
from Counselor Troi.

219
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,917
Doctor.

220
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:22,375
Doctor, I do respect
your opinion, and...

221
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,917
I want you on the Bridge
for the next day or so.

222
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,166
The Admiral must remain
in the best of health

223
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,792
for these negotiations

224
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:32,709
and he might require
your services.

225
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,834
Admiral, we're approaching
the Idini Star Cluster.

226
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,291
Would you like
to take the conn

227
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,291
as we make transit?

228
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,709
Thank you, Captain. I would.

229
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,709
(<i> gasping</i> )

230
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:28,834
Well, Admiral, quite a little
surprise you've pulled on us.

231
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,417
Yes, quite.

232
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,792
Neglected to mention.

233
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:37,208
I began some new
therapy before... I left.

234
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,583
Seems to be working.

235
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,333
I haven't felt this good

236
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,959
since the last time
I was in space--

237
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,542
the<i> Gettysburg.</i>

238
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:46,834
All I needed to get me out of
that chair was the thought

239
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:50,333
of walking the decks
in command of a starship again.

240
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,083
Admiral, you only have
the conn temporarily.

241
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,834
A figure of speech.

242
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,417
Of course she's your ship.

243
00:12:56,417 --> 00:13:00,875
I'll just keep an eye
on her for a while.

244
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,583
The Admiral displayed
a remarkable improvement.

245
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,542
Captain, no one recovers
from Iverson's disease.

246
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:20,542
There's no known cure.

247
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:21,583
There have been no cases

248
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,709
where it's gone
into remission.

249
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,375
I have never heard
of any therapy

250
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,125
that would produce
results like that.

251
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,417
Then how do you
account for it?

252
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,375
I can't. All I can tell you

253
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,834
is that the Admiral
has been confined

254
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,709
to his support chair
for the last four years

255
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:34,083
by the effects of Iverson's.

256
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,000
By all the medical
facts we know

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,709
he should never
have walked again.

258
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:41,458
I want you to look into it,
Doctor-- thoroughly.

259
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,208
Yes, sir.

260
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,917
The terrorists have given you

261
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,875
six Earth days
to bring him here

262
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:51,291
or the hostages will die.

263
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,291
I don't know how much
more information

264
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,750
you think you can get
from that tape.

265
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,083
Mark!

266
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,000
My God,
what's happened?

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,542
It's the new therapy
I'm taking.

268
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,583
It's... it's
working, Annie.

269
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,375
Oh, darling!

270
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,750
Mark...?

271
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,709
I told you I just needed
to get back in space again.

272
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:25,041
You really are
looking much better.

273
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,000
It's the new treatment.

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,458
No.

275
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,625
Come here.

276
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,583
I hope you're heading
for the bedroom.

277
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,667
You stop it.

278
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,625
Darling...

279
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,250
you look like you
looked 20 years ago.

280
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,083
You flatter me.

281
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,458
Now you tell me what the hell
is going on.

282
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,000
(<i> gasping and groaning</i> )

283
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't know.

284
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,959
Mark!

285
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,709
(<i> groaning</i> )

286
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:52,709
Sick Bay.

287
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:53,709
Medical emergency

288
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,458
in the Admiral's
quarters.

289
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,583
(<i> groaning</i> )

290
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,375
I found traces
of chemical substances

291
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,125
in his blood
and tissue samples

292
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,667
but none of them are
in our pharmacopoeia.

293
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,542
I'm still working
on alien references

294
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,166
to substances
like these.

295
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,625
All I can tell you

296
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,250
is that he's
ingested something

297
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,917
that's strongly
affecting his body.

298
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,208
Specifics, Doctor.

299
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,917
Captain, there's so
many things going on

300
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,500
I can't give you specifics
until I do a lot more tests.

301
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Well, give me
what you have now.

302
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,542
His red cell count
is running riot.

303
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:27,291
The cellular structure of his
body is radically changing.

304
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,750
We can't make
any decisions on that

305
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,709
until we know
what it's changing<i> to.</i>

306
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:32,333
His DNA is skewed.

307
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,625
Don't ask me how

308
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,667
but he even
<i>looks</i> younger.

309
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,208
And Captain--

310
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,625
there are absolutely no traces
of Iverson's disease.

311
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,000
You said there was no cure
for Iverson's.

312
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,083
None that we know of.

313
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,750
Well, whatever
these substances

314
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,917
are doing to his body

315
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,291
at least they've
done that for him.

316
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,792
But how or why?

317
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:55,166
It's too early to say.

318
00:15:55,166 --> 00:16:00,291
Get me some answers, Doctor,
as soon as possible.

319
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,959
Yes, sir.

320
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,917
(<i> door chimes</i> )

321
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:09,583
Captain.

322
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,375
Mrs. Jameson, I have
to ask the Admiral

323
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,000
some questions.

324
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,625
Ask away.

325
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,583
There's nothing
to hide now.

326
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,208
Admiral, in addition
to your rank

327
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,792
you are a particularly
valuable commodity just now.

328
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,834
Starfleet has a right
to some answers.

329
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:36,750
I had planned this
for a long time now--

330
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,834
ever since I learned
that I had Iverson's disease--

331
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,625
since it put me
in that chair.

332
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,125
What did you do, Mark?

333
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,083
There is a planet
in the Cerebus system--

334
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,458
Cerebus II--

335
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,458
they say the natives there
have a process

336
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,917
that rejuvenates the body;
gives you your youth back.

337
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:56,458
Yes, I've heard of that story.
It's a myth.

338
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,166
It's true, Picard.

339
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,000
I am living proof.

340
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,500
Oh, it's dangerous.

341
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,542
The mortality rate
is high, and...

342
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:06,792
it's very painful.

343
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,583
Aliens are seldom allowed
to obtain the process

344
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,083
but I managed it.

345
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,583
I negotiated a treaty
for Cerebus II some years ago

346
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:19,041
and they felt obligated to honor
my request for the process.

347
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,333
Obviously it works very rapidly,
but how does it work?

348
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,917
The herb and drug combinations
are self-administered slowly

349
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:28,291
over a period of two years.

350
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,041
Every response
is different

351
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,583
depending on a being's DNA.

352
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,500
I got enough
for both of us, Annie

353
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,709
but I had to test it
on myself first.

354
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:38,834
I-I couldn't risk you.

355
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:41,333
If I died...
well, I was half a man,

356
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,875
so what did it matter?

357
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,333
It would matter to me.

358
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,583
But I was starting
to change, Annie.

359
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,792
It... it was
almost undetectable

360
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:53,000
but the improvement was there.

361
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,041
And then when this hostage
situation came up

362
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,000
I... I knew I had to be
at my peak to deal with it.

363
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,583
I didn't have time to wait
for the drug

364
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,959
to-to work
naturally.

365
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,542
So you took the whole dose.

366
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,333
I took<i> both</i> of them.

367
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,041
And look at me,
Annie!

368
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,375
Look at me.

369
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm-I'm strong, I'm alert, fit.

370
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,083
I'm fitter than you are, Picard

371
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,208
and I'm getting
younger.

372
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,000
The only question I have,
Admiral

373
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,625
is why you thought
it necessary to be young

374
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,542
to negotiate the release
of the hostages--

375
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:31,709
even willing to put
your life at risk for it.

376
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,792
I'll be on the Bridge, Admiral,
if you want to talk further.

377
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,917
Why didn't you tell me, Mark?

378
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:56,542
We've always been honest
with each other until now.

379
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,667
Annie, I did it for us.

380
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:03,208
Oh... oh, I'm sure
you believed that--

381
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,125
until you had a chance
to head up a mission

382
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,917
and to
command again.

383
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:12,792
And then you just upended
the bottle or whatever it was

384
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,917
and damn everything.

385
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,083
Did you think about me

386
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,458
at all?

387
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,333
I obtained enough of the dosage
for both of us.

388
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,166
But you never asked
if I wanted it.

389
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,959
It's just like you, Mark

390
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:31,083
to assume that what you felt
was right was the only answer.

391
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,291
But it was the right answer
for me.

392
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,208
It was killing you having
to take care of an invalid.

393
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,041
Annie, what good was I to you?

394
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,417
We can be together again.

395
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:41,417
Let me go!

396
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:44,166
I can get you another
supply of the drug.

397
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,709
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

398
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,750
(<i> communications beep</i> )

399
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,875
Commander Data

400
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:14,250
I wish to open a communication
frequency to Karnas.

401
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,375
Aye, sir.

402
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,917
One moment, Mr. Data.

403
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,166
Admiral, this is Picard.

404
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,959
May I know the reason
for this communication?

405
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:25,500
Karnas must have tried
to negotiate with the terrorists

406
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,291
before he was forced
to call on me.

407
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,834
I want all the information
he has access to.

408
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:33,834
You said Karnas was a proud man,
Admiral, probably sensitive

409
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,875
to his failure
to deal with this situation.

410
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,750
Is it wise to press him on this?

411
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,875
I am the negotiator, Picard.

412
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,500
Karnas will have to cooperate
with me and the terrorists

413
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,250
and damn his sensitivities.

414
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,667
Then may I suggest
a secure channel, Admiral?

415
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:50,709
A sensible precaution, Picard.

416
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,250
Make it so.

417
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,834
Make it so.

418
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,208
Aye, sir.

419
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,709
Frequency open
and secured.

420
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:01,375
Karnas.

421
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,333
What is it you want, Admiral?

422
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,041
We're on a secure channel,
Karnas.

423
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,500
You can talk freely.

424
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,625
Who's behind this thing?

425
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,250
You said dissidents.

426
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,875
Yes-- political opponents
who feel the Federation

427
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,583
will disavow me
as governor if...

428
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,166
if they stir up enough trouble
here on Mordan.

429
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,041
Then who is it? Ardan? Gilnor?

430
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,458
They're dead, Jameson--
a long time now.

431
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:30,083
A long time I thought
you were dead, too.

432
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,875
I almost died a couple of times
on missions

433
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,583
but I always
made it through somehow.

434
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,959
Yes. Now you're coming
back to Mordan

435
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:41,041
to negotiate for hostages again.

436
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,542
It's almost as though

437
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:46,041
the 45 years in between
never happened.

438
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,417
You've never forgiven me.

439
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,667
Of course I have.

440
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,917
It-it was years ago.

441
00:21:56,709 --> 00:22:00,000
There are no dissidents,
are there?

442
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,583
No terrorists.

443
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,333
You have the hostages!

444
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:09,041
And if I have,
you're coming to Mordan, Jameson

445
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,875
and you're going to negotiate
for their lives

446
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:15,417
and I'm going to ask
a very, very high price.

447
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,250
What if I refuse?

448
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,542
Then the hostages will die.

449
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:22,291
You've seen
how my executioners work.

450
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,834
They are still as efficient
as they were--

451
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:27,208
perhaps even more skilled now.

452
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,750
You'll come

453
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,583
even if you don't have
much honor left.

454
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,041
Conn, are we still on schedule
to arrive at Mordan

455
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,000
in 38 hours?

456
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,250
Aye, sir.
We're at warp 4.

457
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,875
Picard, I want to jump
to warp 8

458
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,000
so that we arrive ahead
of our announced ETA.

459
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,709
It will throw Karnas
off balance

460
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:03,458
and we can catch him
before he's ready.

461
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,375
Ready for what,
exactly, Admiral?

462
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,709
I believe Karnas
has the hostages

463
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:09,917
and there never were
any dissidents.

464
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,917
What has happened
to bring you to
that conclusion?

465
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,041
That's quite a big jump.

466
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,834
I'm not at liberty
to say, Picard

467
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:17,792
but negotiations are
no longer the answer.

468
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:22,291
Isn't the most important thing
the hostages' lives?

469
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,166
And you agree
with that, too, Riker?

470
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,166
I do, sir.

471
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,917
Good, 'cause I plan

472
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:29,000
to personally lead
the away team

473
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,875
on an armed rescue mission
to get them out of there.

474
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,667
Commander Data

475
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,709
bring up the plans I requested
on the viewscreen, please.

476
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:43,750
Aye, sir.

477
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,667
Most of Mordan's
principal city

478
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:48,208
was devastated
during the war.

479
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,166
What was left
consisted largely

480
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,291
of a network
of underground tunnels--

481
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,000
a rat's maze.

482
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,291
When they rebuilt the city

483
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:59,041
they simply built over
the existing tunnels.

484
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,625
I have it, sir.

485
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,291
Pardon me, sir
but where do these tunnels

486
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,625
come into the picture?

487
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,000
This is where Karnas
held his hostages before

488
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,417
and where I believe
he has them now.

489
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,375
Wouldn't that be
a little obvious, Admiral?

490
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,291
Karnas is a dogged
strategist, Picard--

491
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,583
not a brilliant one.

492
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,250
He sticks to what works.

493
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,166
He will kill the hostages

494
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,542
if we do not get
them out of there.

495
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,667
Therefore you see
this armed raid

496
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:30,959
as the only option?

497
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,709
You don't agree?

498
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,667
With respect, Admiral,
I would point out

499
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:37,458
that no one else has heard
or considered Karnas's demands.

500
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,667
The Federation might
view them differently

501
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,583
if they knew what they were.

502
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:46,875
Starfleet has given
me command of the
away team, Picard

503
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:50,792
and I intend to use
them as I see fit.

504
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:58,125
Our anniversary is next week--
our 50th.

505
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:02,166
In his heart, he's still
the same man you married, Anne.

506
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,500
That's true.

507
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,375
He still
cares for you

508
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,917
despite the physical changes
he's undergoing.

509
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:10,208
But he's getting younger

510
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:14,333
and I'm...
well, look at me.

511
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,917
Why did he do this?

512
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:20,125
Because there are lives
at stake, Mrs. Jameson.

513
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,959
Well, what about our lives?

514
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,625
His and mine.

515
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:27,333
I was looking forward
to time together finally.

516
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,750
Our retirement.

517
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,625
Now he's
young again

518
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:34,000
and has his life to live over.

519
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,291
Doctor, she has to know.

520
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:40,375
Know what?

521
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:46,750
Anne, your husband...

522
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,208
What is it?

523
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,333
He's not stabilizing.

524
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:53,709
He may not have that life
to live over.

525
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:17,041
We'll be at Mordan
in three hours.

526
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:23,041
I couldn't sleep, either.

527
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:26,333
I never could
before a mission.

528
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:29,041
Always wound up
in the observation lounge

529
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:32,083
staring out at the stars,
thinking.

530
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:36,041
Perhaps in this case,
rethinking?

531
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:50,500
Why is this mission
so important to you?

532
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,458
Why did you risk your life
to lead it personally?

533
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,166
I want to save lives, Captain.

534
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,166
Noble sentiments...

535
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,000
but that's too easy an answer.

536
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,667
You've been here before.

537
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:05,291
You negotiated a release of the
hostages with Karnas before.

538
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:09,625
Why is it now your answer
is an armed raid?

539
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:13,291
It's my away team
you're sending in there.

540
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,125
I think there's something
you're not telling me

541
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,250
and I have a right
to know what it is.

542
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:21,583
Do you know the background?

543
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,500
The Mordanites had
some sophistication

544
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,500
but were still ruled
by family tribal units.

545
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,792
Karnas's father was
the ruling chief

546
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:36,000
of one of the families.

547
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,417
Another tribe had him
assassinated.

548
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:42,625
Karnas seized the passengers
of a starliner

549
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,166
and held them hostage

550
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:47,125
demanding that Starfleet
provide him with weapons

551
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,458
that would enable him
to defeat his rivals.

552
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:52,625
That's the official record.

553
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:57,041
<i>Officially</i> the story is

554
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:02,375
that after two other
mediators were murdered...

555
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,125
I went in

556
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:06,333
and negotiated
with Karnas

557
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,959
to bring out the
hostages safely.

558
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,542
Are you saying
that's not the truth?

559
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:17,709
It wasn't my golden oratory
that saved them, Captain.

560
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:22,417
I gave Karnas the weapons
he wanted.

561
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:25,875
You did what?

562
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:28,792
I gave exactly the same weapons
to his rivals.

563
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:31,375
My interpretation
of the prime directive:

564
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,875
Let them solve
their problems

565
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,709
with those arms
on an equal basis.

566
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,583
And that decision plunged them
into 40 years of civil war.

567
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,959
I didn't know that would happen.

568
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:48,083
I thought a minor war...

569
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,709
It would be settled
in less than a year.

570
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:52,959
How would I know
it would take four decades?

571
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:56,750
But I...

572
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,583
I falsified the records
to Starfleet.

573
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:03,500
But I lived with that
on my soul, Picard.

574
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,834
63 people came away safe,
but millions died on Mordan

575
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:09,417
because I delivered
those weapons.

576
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:12,917
Karnas could have worked
for peace

577
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,291
during those years
instead of continuing the war.

578
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,208
It's not all on your head,
Admiral.

579
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,250
But I started it.

580
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,792
I lit the match.

581
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,959
Now, finally,
I can vindicate myself

582
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,792
if only in a small way.

583
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:26,417
I came to negotiate

584
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:29,083
but that isn't
what Karnas wants.

585
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,375
Revenge.

586
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,875
That's why he demanded you

587
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,917
when he knew that you
were still alive.

588
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:37,792
And I'm not going
to give it to him, Picard.

589
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm going to do
what I should have
done the first time.

590
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,959
We're taking the hostages
out by force if necessary.

591
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:46,333
No deals.

592
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,792
Prepare to
energize, chief.

593
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,291
Belay that.

594
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,959
Admiral, your proper
place is on the Bridge.

595
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:02,083
I will remind you
one more time, Picard--

596
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,125
I am the Senior
Mission Commander

597
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,208
and I am leading this team.

598
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,667
Sir?

599
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,542
The Admiral is correct,
Number One.

600
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,417
He has that right

601
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:14,709
but I am the Captain
of this ship

602
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:17,709
and I have a right
to accompany him.

603
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:23,834
Riker, you're in command
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

604
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,291
Energize.

605
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,083
Yes, perfect.

606
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,500
We are in the M-4 tunnel

607
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,917
directly under
the governor's residence.

608
00:30:57,917 --> 00:30:59,625
M-4 is a subsidiary tunnel

609
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,250
but it crosses and links
with several main ones.

610
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,792
I am sorry, sir.

611
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,375
That does not correspond
with the information

612
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,583
in my tricorder.

613
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,500
Your information
is incorrect, Commander.

614
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,000
I know these tunnels
like the back of my own hand.

615
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,166
Keep scanning for signs
of human life-forms.

616
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:16,125
Karnas held the hostages
in these tunnels before.

617
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,291
He'll do it again.

618
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,917
Captain.

619
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:32,417
The Admiral is
definitely incorrect.

620
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:33,917
The tunnel schematics we have

621
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:35,500
show this to be
a dead end.

622
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,917
It was sealed off
two years ago.

623
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:38,583
I have no doubt you're
right, Mr. Data.

624
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,083
However, 45 years ago

625
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,875
I'm sure it linked in
with the tunnels

626
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,709
the Admiral
remembers.

627
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,166
Damn!

628
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,333
Geordi?

629
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:58,875
This is... steelplast, sir.

630
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,500
Fairly recent
installation.

631
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,917
This is the most
direct route.

632
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:04,250
Set phasers
to cut through it.

633
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,458
(<i> phasers beeping</i> )

634
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:26,375
(<i> clanking</i> )

635
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,792
If you have
the coordinates

636
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:32,333
where you think
the hostages are, sir

637
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,709
we could just
beam in over there.

638
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:36,750
Karnas may not have them
in the same place.

639
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,458
There's no substitute,
Lieutenant

640
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,083
for a little personal
reconnoiter.

641
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:56,083
Admiral, there's an
infrared light signal up ahead--

642
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,166
steady beam,
straight across

643
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,500
the tunnel,
chest high.

644
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,667
There's another one
at... about waist level.

645
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,291
An alarm trigger or...?

646
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:03,625
Reset phasers to stun.

647
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:04,750
(<i> beeping</i> )

648
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,834
PICARD:
Take cover!

649
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:10,500
(<i> phaser fire</i> )

650
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,792
Sir, look out!

651
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,458
Their phasers, sir.

652
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:31,417
Set on kill.

653
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:32,500
Thank you, Mr. Data.

654
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,458
I have heard the sound before.

655
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,709
(<i> groaning</i> )

656
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,709
(<i> groaning</i> )

657
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,792
(<i> groaning</i> )

658
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:52,792
YAR:
Is he hit?

659
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:54,458
No sign
of a wound.

660
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,083
<i>Enterprise,</i>
this is Picard.

661
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,125
Six to beam up, now!

662
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:17,417
The Admiral?
Sick Bay.

663
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:20,250
"Not good" is a
galactic understatement.

664
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,166
Sir? Karnas again.

665
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,917
On screen.

666
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:27,125
<i>Enterprise,</i> there has been
an armed intrusion

667
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,959
in the tunnels beneath the city.

668
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:31,083
Now, that smells of Jameson.

669
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,875
Where is he?

670
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,959
Karnas, this
is Picard.

671
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,291
I'm sorry
to inform you

672
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:39,291
the Admiral is
critically ill.

673
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:42,041
That is not my concern.

674
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,875
Sick or well

675
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,250
you have ten minutes
to beam him down.

676
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,542
(<i> communications beep</i> )

677
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:49,083
TROI:
Sick Bay to Bridge.

678
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,458
Picard.

679
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,208
Dr. Crusher requests
your presence

680
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,834
in Sick Bay immediately, sir.

681
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:55,709
I'm on my way.

682
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:01,041
Sick Bay.

683
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,375
What is it, Doctor?

684
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:08,291
I think you better see
for yourself, Captain.

685
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,417
Picard.

686
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,500
Picard, I have to get to Karnas.

687
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,875
I can't let him out
of my care, Captain.

688
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,625
It's my last option.

689
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,917
The raid failed.

690
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:31,375
All I have left to bargain with
is myself.

691
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,500
RIKER:
Bridge to Picard.

692
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,667
Picard here.

693
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,583
A new message from Karnas, sir.

694
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:38,417
If we don't deliver Jameson
in five minutes

695
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:40,458
one of the hostages
will be executed.

696
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:43,750
15 minutes after that,
another.

697
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,208
He promises
the method of execution

698
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,208
will be most painful.

699
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:50,208
Let me go.

700
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:53,792
If I give myself over to him,
he'll let the hostages go.

701
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,041
It's me he wants.

702
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,291
It means almost
certain death for you, Admiral.

703
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:02,667
My life for
how many hostages, Picard? 20?

704
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:05,625
Let me go.

705
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,250
Number One, inform Karnas

706
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,458
we'll be beaming down
in less than five minutes.

707
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,458
Did you say "we," sir?

708
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,667
You have your orders,
Number One.

709
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:23,291
Aye, sir.

710
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,834
Who are you?

711
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,041
I want Jameson.

712
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:44,834
Karnas, this<i> is</i>
Admiral Mark Jameson.

713
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:55,875
This... charade...

714
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,542
will accomplish
nothing, Picard.

715
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:02,500
Beam down Jameson and the
hostages will be freed.

716
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,875
Continue this
and I promise you

717
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,792
they will die,
and you with them.

718
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:10,542
Peritor Karnas, you always
were a stubborn man.

719
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:12,667
I thought you wanted me.

720
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,125
I'm here.

721
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:16,208
Release the hostages now.

722
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,667
Peritor was my old title.

723
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,834
Why do you call me that?

724
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,792
I warn you, Picard.

725
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:24,750
This trick is
going on too far.

726
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,417
He has been
coached for some...

727
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:28,709
some devious reason.

728
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:31,875
If this farce does
not stop immediately

729
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,166
you and the hostages
will be put to death!

730
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:36,500
(<i> groans</i> )

731
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,417
Doctor!

732
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:39,125
(<i> yelling</i> )

733
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,834
I am waiting for an
explanation, Captain.

734
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,875
He is the Admiral, Karnas!

735
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,083
Before we left on this mission,
he administered an overdose

736
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,792
of an alien de-aging
drug to himself. He...

737
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:52,250
he wanted to face you

738
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,000
with strength again
on even terms.

739
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,083
This is what the drug
has done to him.

740
00:37:57,083 --> 00:38:00,333
This story you are telling
me is unbelievable.

741
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:05,250
Jameson is a man of more
than 80 years, not this!

742
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,792
I want that old man, Picard.

743
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:12,583
I want to show him this world
he helped to make

744
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:15,417
the scars
on old soldiers' bodies

745
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:18,458
the graveyards
of our young dead

746
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:21,875
the wasted cities that we are
still rebuilding.

747
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,500
(<i> groaning</i> )

748
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,417
And all of it
caused by him.

749
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:28,792
As I understand it, Karnas

750
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:30,667
it was you
who demanded the weapons

751
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:32,417
to avenge your
father's death.

752
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:36,000
But Jameson didn't give
weapons to only us.

753
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,417
If he had, we would have quickly
triumphed over our enemies

754
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,291
and there would
have been peace in
all these decades.

755
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:46,667
I want him to pay for that,
Picard.

756
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,125
(<i> Jameson groans loudly</i> )

757
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,709
Captain, I think Mrs. Jameson

758
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:52,041
should beam down now.

759
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,917
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is Picard.

760
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:56,375
Have Mrs. Jameson prepare
to beam down.

761
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,709
Karnas, I asked Dr. Crusher
to bring with her

762
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:01,500
the visual records we made
of the Admiral's deterioration.

763
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,542
Will you look at them?

764
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:04,375
You're wasting my time, Picard.

765
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,333
Just a few moments.

766
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,792
You saw the Admiral
on the<i> Enterprise</i>

767
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:10,250
when he was en route
for Mordan?
Yes.

768
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,750
And you recognized him?
Yes.

769
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,792
Is this the man
you saw?

770
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:16,625
This is the man I want.

771
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:17,792
He's here, Karnas.

772
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:18,834
Look.

773
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:35,375
Once he took the compound,
there was no way to stop it.

774
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,000
(<i> gasping</i> )

775
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,291
You'll have to deal
with me, Karnas.

776
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:59,291
Whatever you wanted from Jameson
isn't possible anymore

777
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,041
and you wanted revenge.

778
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:03,208
You blamed your war on him

779
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,625
and there's no doubt he had
a lot to do with it

780
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:08,500
but you had the weapons
and you used them.

781
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,208
You could have tried
for negotiations

782
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,792
for peace on your planet
long ago.

783
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:14,500
Instead, you chose to fight.

784
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,750
How many of those 40 years
of civil war

785
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,208
are on your head, Karnas?

786
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,875
Jameson must pay
for his crimes.

787
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,834
I have sworn it
to my people.

788
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:24,125
45 years ago he made
the wrong decision.

789
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:27,375
He wanted to come back,
to somehow right it

790
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:31,041
to atone for
what he did.

791
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:36,208
Now, all he can do is
give himself up to you.

792
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,417
He brought this retribution
on himself.

793
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:39,750
No!

794
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,000
I don't believe you.

795
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,125
You're shielding Jameson
on the ship

796
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,500
and you're telling me this tale

797
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,709
to save his life.

798
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:48,291
Peritor Karnas...

799
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:52,041
There were only two of us
in the meeting.

800
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:55,083
You didn't even trust
your lieutenants there.

801
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:59,208
You told me that
old Peritor Sane

802
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,959
had ordered your father's
assassination.

803
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:06,000
You told me that you wanted arms
to destroy him.

804
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,208
Peace... wasn't on your mind.

805
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:13,000
All you wanted was revenge

806
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,250
and I gave you the weapons
to do it.

807
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:20,792
Jameson told you this.

808
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:23,000
If it is you...

809
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,709
show me the scar.

810
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:27,083
There!

811
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:31,542
The blood cut you gave me
to seal our bargain!

812
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:37,917
It is you.

813
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:43,291
Somehow... it is you.

814
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:47,667
(<i> gasping</i> )

815
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:53,333
Then die by your own weapon!

816
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,834
No.

817
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:04,500
No, my revenge will be
in seeing you live like this.

818
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:09,583
(<i> groans</i> )

819
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:14,458
Such pain.

820
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:17,208
The compound he took
is forcing his cells and organs

821
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:19,750
to go further, younger,
and they can't take the stress.

822
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,834
It's like they're imploding.

823
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,959
And I can't give him
anything to stop it.

824
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,041
Can you ease
the pain?

825
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:29,083
Mark...

826
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:31,667
can you hear me?

827
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,583
Yes.

828
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,875
I will always love you.

829
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:41,333
Annie, with the golden hair.

830
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:45,041
Flatterer.

831
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:47,125
It's gray now.

832
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:54,166
I see only the gold.

833
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,875
(<i> groans</i> )

834
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:05,041
(<i> crying</i> )

835
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:15,458
Rest, Jameson.

836
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:20,500
Your long night... and mine...

837
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,000
are over.

838
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:30,875
The hostages will be freed
immediately, Captain.

839
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:35,500
I'm prepared
to be cooperative.

840
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,834
The hostages have been freed
by Karnas unharmed

841
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,625
and the body
of Admiral Mark Jameson

842
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:54,000
has been buried on Mordan
at the request of his widow

843
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,291
and by the permission
of Karnas.

844
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:01,041
The quest for youth,
Number One.

845
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,250
So futile.

846
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,458
Age and wisdom have
their graces, too.

847
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:10,250
I wonder if one doesn't
have to have age and wisdom

848
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,792
to appreciate that, sir.

849
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:15,792
I hope not, Number One.

850
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:18,291
Mr. La Forge, prepare
to take us out of orbit.

851
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:20,667
Set course for Isis III.

852
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:22,208
Aye, sir.

853
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:24,291
Leaving orbit.
