1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,583
That's very good.

2
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,917
Well, that's
very nice.

3
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:11,500
No, it isn't.

4
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:13,875
I just can't get it right.

5
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:15,375
You think the wings
are too big?

6
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:17,166
TROI: Oh, no,
not at all.

7
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,250
Birds have wings of
all sizes, Eric.

8
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,375
And you shouldn't worry
about making it look perfect.

9
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:26,792
But Mrs. Narsu said we should
try to make our sculptures

10
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,667
as realistic as possible.

11
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:30,083
Well, she's right.

12
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,208
It is important that you
be able to make the clay

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,083
take the shape
you want it to have.

14
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,834
But you're not supposed
to be concentrating

15
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,583
on technique today.
I'm here to help you focus

16
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:44,250
on the feelings you want to
convey with your sculpture.

17
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:48,083
For instance, what do you think
about when you see a bird?

18
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,458
Flying?

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,542
Fine.
So, make your sculpture

20
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,542
make me think of flying, too.

21
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,250
How's it going, Data?

22
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,667
I have finished.

23
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:10,083
The dimensions are
accurate to within 1.3%

24
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sure they are.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Data, you obviously don't have
a problem with realism,

26
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:19,792
but you're here to
work on your imagination.

27
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:23,917
Maybe you should try something
a little more... abstract.

28
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,417
Here...

29
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:31,250
I want you to start
a new piece.

30
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:36,792
I'd like you to
sculpt... music.

31
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:40,792
Counselor, music is a collection
of acoustic vibrations.

32
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,709
How can I reproduce
a sound with clay?

33
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,625
Well, think of the effects
that sounds have on people.

34
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:51,000
The images that music
brings to your mind.

35
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,041
And then, give it a form.

36
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,625
It's a start.

37
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,458
Riker to Data,
please report to the Bridge.

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,917
Acknowledged, sir.
On my way.

39
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,458
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47615.2.</i>

40
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,417
<i>We have encountered</i>
<i>a rogue comet in sector 1156.</i>

41
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,083
<i>It is not native</i>
<i>to this region of space</i>

42
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,667
<i>and there is no previous record</i>
<i>of this object</i>

43
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,625
<i>on any Federation charts.</i>

44
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,333
Based on its
present trajectory,

45
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,000
the comet appears
to have originated

46
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,250
in the D'Arsay system.

47
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,667
That's over two sectors away.

48
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,250
That is correct, sir.

49
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,667
This object has been en route
for 87 million years.

50
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,667
That's a long time
alone in the dark.

51
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,500
Mmm.

52
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:55,208
Begin a full sensor
analysis, Mr. Data,

53
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,542
and log the findings

54
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,500
with the Federation
Astrophysical Survey.

55
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:00,750
Aye, sir.

56
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,500
(<i> console beeping</i> )

57
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,333
The comet's outer shell
is composed

58
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,083
primarily of gaseous
hydrogen and helium

59
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,375
surrounding an icy mantle.

60
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:12,166
The inner core consists
of heavier elements.

61
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,417
What was that?

62
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,583
There is a distortion
within the comet's inner core.

63
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,917
I believe we experienced
an intense sensor echo.

64
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,250
Can you correct for it?

65
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,291
I am attempting
to do so now, sir.

66
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,959
I have compensated
for the effect.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,583
Sensors are reconfigured
for a low intensity sweep.

68
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,500
We are still picking up
some interference,

69
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:39,458
but the distortion
is manageable.

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,291
At these settings,
the scan will be complete

71
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,125
in 39 hours.

72
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,750
Worf says he's gonna teach us

73
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:53,250
some<i> mok'bara</i>
throwing techniques today.

74
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,375
TROI: More like
falling techniques.

75
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:58,333
Last time we did that,
I was sore for a week.

76
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,875
What's this?

77
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:03,291
I have no idea.
I've never seen it before.

78
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,709
Maybe Will left it for you--
a little present.

79
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,875
It's not quite
his style.

80
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,667
Then maybe it's a
secret admirer.

81
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,917
Ooh--
that's an interesting thought.

82
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,667
Well, you'll figure
it out later.

83
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,875
Come on, we're
gonna be late.

84
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,959
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,583
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

86
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

87
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,792
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

88
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:12,208
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

89
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,083
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

90
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,208
That's nice.

91
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,083
Data...

92
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,583
This is amazing.
How did you come up with this?

93
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,709
DATA: I followed your
advice, Counselor.

94
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,583
I used my imagination.

95
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,250
That's an understatement.

96
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,750
For some reason,
as I was shaping the clay,

97
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:44,500
the image of the mask was
exceptionally clear in my mind.

98
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:47,709
The design seemed to flow
quite naturally.

99
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,875
Data, have you been
in my quarters?

100
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,417
No, Counselor.

101
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,333
Someone left an
object in my room.

102
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,834
Some kind of artifact.
And it has something

103
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,291
very similar to this.

104
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,000
And you don't know
anything about it?

105
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,250
I do not.

106
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,458
ERIC:
Excuse me, Counselor.

107
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:11,125
Can you help me
with my terminal?

108
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,417
It's not working right.

109
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,667
Perhaps we should investigate
this matter further.

110
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,250
RIKER: These symbols
don't match anything

111
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,125
in the Federation
linguistics banks.

112
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,917
Some kind of
alien information

113
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,208
has been downloaded into
our computer core.

114
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,625
I don't know
how it's working,

115
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,417
but it's reconfiguring
our systems.

116
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,000
How did it get in?

117
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,875
I was able to trace its
path from the replicators

118
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,125
to the sensor array.

119
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,125
The sensors?

120
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,875
They've been scanning that comet
for the past 18 hours.

121
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:42,709
Those energy readings
from the comet's core--

122
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,208
that sensor echo--
we still don't know

123
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,500
what's inside
that thing.

124
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:48,208
Maybe it's about time
we find out.

125
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,792
Could we use the phasers

126
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,834
to melt down
the shell of the comet?

127
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,041
Yeah. A dispersed wide-field
beam might do the trick.

128
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,375
And it wouldn't take long

129
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:57,875
to come up with the
firing parameters.

130
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,375
What do you think, Data?

131
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Data... what's wrong?

132
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:06,875
I believe I recognize
these symbols.

133
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,750
How?

134
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,875
I do not know.

135
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:13,542
You think maybe your
systems have been affected?

136
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,667
It is a possibility.

137
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:18,458
I do not believe my systems
are currently impaired,

138
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,625
but I will run a full
diagnostic to make certain.

139
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,917
What do you
think they mean?

140
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,125
Boundary.

141
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,542
Border.

142
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,125
Road.

143
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,333
Companion.

144
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,709
Message.

145
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,417
Messenger.

146
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,208
LA FORGE:
What's that one?

147
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,792
Death.

148
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:51,750
Captain, phasers are
set for wide dispersal.

149
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,166
10% maximum power.

150
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,041
The beam will
automatically terminate

151
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,417
once the comet's
core is reached.

152
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,583
Very well, Mr. Worf.

153
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,959
Fire.

154
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,333
Phasers have
terminated.

155
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:35,166
Mr. Data,
what are we looking at?

156
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,458
Is it a ship?

157
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,417
I do not know, sir.

158
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,917
The object is nearly solid.
It is composed primarily

159
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,834
of fortanium and several
unknown materials.

160
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,166
It is over 87 million years old.

161
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,709
That's older than
the comet itself.

162
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,792
Could someone from the D'Arsay
system have built it?

163
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:57,000
There are no technologically
advanced cultures

164
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,041
in that system now.

165
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,917
But perhaps...

166
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:04,375
87 million years ago,
there were.

167
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,750
Why would they want to
hide something like that

168
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,583
inside a comet?

169
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:12,083
Possibly... it accumulated
those frozen gasses

170
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,583
over time as it
traveled through space.

171
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,875
In any case,
it's definitely responsible

172
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,458
for the system anomalies
we've been experiencing.

173
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,750
They're using our sensor
beam as a carrier wave

174
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:24,875
to transmit information into
our computers and replicators.

175
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,083
But the question remains, why?
What is its purpose?

176
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,125
Captain, I believe this object

177
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,583
is an informational
archive.

178
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,667
Why do you say that, Mr. Data?

179
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,208
I do not know.

180
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,291
However, I seem to have
an intuitive understanding

181
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,000
of its function.

182
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,750
LA FORGE:
Data, the internal structure

183
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,792
of that thing
is pretty complex.

184
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,834
And it's got a repetitive
node configuration,

185
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,959
which might suggest
a database of some kind,

186
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,750
but it could be
practically anything.

187
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,166
I don't see how you can know
for sure what it is.

188
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,625
Data, do you believe

189
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,667
that you're in communication
with that object?

190
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,458
It is a possibility, sir.

191
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,750
I recommend we run a
level-1 diagnostic

192
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,792
of my positronic net to
determine if that is the case.

193
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:08,083
Very well.
Mr. La Forge, give him a hand.

194
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,500
Aye, sir.

195
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,583
You think it's just trying
to make contact with us?

196
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,542
Yes, it's possible,
but if that is an archive

197
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,333
from some ancient
civilization,

198
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,166
we should allow
it to do so.

199
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,625
But we must be careful.

200
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,291
Mr. Worf, will you keep
an eye on the sensors?

201
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,542
If the ship is in any danger,
I want you to sever

202
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,041
the connection immediately.

203
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,709
WORF:
Aye, sir.

204
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,291
(<i> door chimes</i> )

205
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,959
Come.

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,166
Captain?

207
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,875
Yes, come in, Number One.

208
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,583
We've confined the
system corruption.

209
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,041
It won't be spreading
any further.

210
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,041
But we still have
alien symbols

211
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,000
floating around
in our computer.

212
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,583
This is quite a collection
you've assembled.

213
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,750
I've seen these things
all over the ship.

214
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,208
They all look the same--

215
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,208
primitive and
nonfunctional.

216
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,333
Ah, ceremonial,
and deceptively primitive.

217
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,625
Only an advanced
technological society

218
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:06,375
could have built
that object out there.

219
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:10,125
These artifacts played
a ritualistic role

220
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,875
in that society, I think.

221
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,000
Do you think
Data could be right?

222
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,875
Could we have stumbled across
some sort of alien library?

223
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,709
Oh, yes, it's possible,
and if so,

224
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,000
this is a find of the
most enormous significance.

225
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,750
That library seems designed
to do so much more

226
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:26,166
than simply
store information.

227
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,750
Who knows what we might
not learn from this?

228
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,583
I keep seeing this design.

229
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,208
Yes, this symbol seems to be
of particular significance.

230
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,917
What do you think it means?
Well, the concept

231
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,041
of the four cardinal
compass directions

232
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,333
are quite common in many
different cultures.

233
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,834
The words that Data
recognized in the computer--

234
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,834
boundary, border, road--

235
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,208
they were all arranged
in this design.

236
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,583
Well, perhaps the artifacts

237
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,125
that all have this
compass symbol

238
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,750
belong to the same
theme-- movement--

239
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,959
finding a direction,
traveling a path,

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,625
crossing a boundary.

241
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:57,875
And death?

242
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:00,792
One of the symbols
was death.

243
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,291
Well, the ultimate
boundary.

244
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,000
Mm-hmm.

245
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,583
I've seen this symbol
everywhere too,

246
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,917
but much less
prominently displayed.

247
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,083
It's always in the background--
much smaller than the others.

248
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,458
RIKER: What do you
think it represents?

249
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,417
I have no idea.
Hmm.

250
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:22,083
Lower synaptic functions
are completely normal.

251
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,083
Autonomous systems
all check out.

252
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,583
I suggest we examine my
memory subsystem next.

253
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,208
All right.

254
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,792
(<i> gasps</i> )

255
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:34,125
Data, what's wrong?

256
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,000
I am not certain.

257
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,875
I am experiencing a...
curious sensation.

258
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:44,458
Well, what is it?

259
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,917
An impulse.

260
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,709
Impulse?
What kind of impulse?

261
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,959
I... do not know.

262
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,750
I'm gonna check out
your higher functions.

263
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,542
Geordi.

264
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,625
What does it feel like

265
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,625
when a person is
losing his mind?

266
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,458
Data, come on,
you're scaring me.

267
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,083
Now, what's going on?

268
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,959
I do not know.

269
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,792
I... am different.

270
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,417
Well, you're gonna
be all right.

271
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,875
You're with me, okay?

272
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,709
Okay.

273
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,750
Listen, I'm gonna
disconnect you.

Captain!

00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,917
I've been waiting
for you.

280
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,875
You should feel honored.

281
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,083
I don't usually
wait for anyone.

282
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,500
What is it you want?

283
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,625
Masaka is waking.

284
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,250
Are you Masaka?

285
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,875
I am not Masaka!

286
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:21,000
I am Ihat.

What have you done
to Commander Data?

288
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,709
Commander Data?

289
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,166
You mean the one
who was here.

290
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,625
Yes.

291
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,125
He's gone.

Ihat, this place
you come from,

298
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:50,166
is it a cultural archive
of your species?

299
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,709
I come from Masaka City.

300
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,041
Are there others
like you there?

Who is Masaka?

305

You will find out.

306
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,166
I would like to know
Masaka, speak with her.

307
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,083
Do you understand pain?

308
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,208
Death?

309
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,750
That is all you need
to know of Masaka.

310
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:35,375
It is what she is.

311
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,667
Go.

312
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:40,709
Leave this place
before she finds you.

313
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,250
It can be done.

314
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,041
I did it.

315
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,041
Masaka.

316
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:08,083
(<i> raspy voice</i> )
I am yours.

317
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,834
Every part of me is yours.

318
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,875
We should confine
him to quarters.

319
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,000
This is a micrograph
of what's happened

320
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,709
to Data's positronic net.

321
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,208
Now, as near as I can tell,
these are behavioral nodes.

322
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,125
I've counted 14 so far.

323
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,917
I think the archive
is using Data

324
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,875
to create different people
within its culture,

325
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,583
much in the same way
it used our replicators

326
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,959
to create artifacts.

327
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,208
As a result, Data's
real personality

328
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,875
has been
completely buried.

329
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:52,375
In a sense, Data has
the android equivalent

330
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,542
of multiple personalities.

331
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:58,041
And the archive
hasn't stopped yet.

332
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,458
Data's positronic net is
still being transformed.

333
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,959
There's no telling how many more

334
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,667
personalities
might emerge.

335
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,041
Geordi, I want you to continue

336
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,208
to scan the archive
and see if you can find

337
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,291
some way to access it.

338
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,041
And in the meantime,

339
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,083
I'll see what I can learn
from these...

340
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,500
people inside Data.

341
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,417
I'm not going to hurt you.

342
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,875
(<i> raspy voice</i> )
Only Masaka can hurt me.

343
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,709
I am for her... alone.

344
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:41,625
I need to speak with Ihat.

345
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,500
Do you understand?

346
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,542
Ihat.

Captain.

349
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,709
That was a cruel joke
you played on me.

350
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,208
For a moment-- a brief moment--

351
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,125
I actually thought
that woman was Masaka.

352
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,291
Whoever took your place
wasn't afraid of Masaka.

353
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,250
He seemed eager for his fate.

354
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,417
Pitiful, isn't it?

355
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,750
You won't catch
me humiliating

356
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:17,667
myself for a woman,
even if she were a queen.

357
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,917
Then Masaka
is your queen.

358
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,792
She's a lazy creature.

359
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:27,959
She spends most
of her time sleeping.

360
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,959
Problem is what she does
when she's awake.

361
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,250
Then we should try
to keep her asleep?

362
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,959
(<i> laughing</i> )

363
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,333
Try to stop the sun from
climbing the sky, hmm?

364
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,917
Mm-mm.

365
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,250
Only Korgano can do that,

366
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,500
and he's not here.

367
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:49,041
Where is he?

368
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,500
(<i> gasps</i> )

369
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,250
(<i> faint voice</i> )
Help me. Please.

370
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,333
What's wrong?

371
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,792
I'm afraid.

372
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,166
Of what?

373
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,458
Her.
Masaka?

374
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,000
Her!

375
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,125
Picard to Bridge.
Report.

376
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,542
The archive just activated
some sort of tractor beam, sir.

377
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,792
We're not able to disengage it.

378
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:24,667
Has there been any
damage to the ship?

379
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,125
There was an
emergency reported

380
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,750
in Ten Forward--
Mr. Worf's on his way.

381
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,583
Captain, there's some kind
of energy pulse

382
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,959
coming through the tractor beam.

383
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,625
It's overriding
our control systems.

384
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,875
I'll be right there.

385
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:35,000
Don't leave me.

386
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,709
(<i> whispering</i> )
I won't leave.

387
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,792
Please... let go of me.

388
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,500
Does it hurt?

389
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,208
Yes.

390
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,083
She's gonna hurt us all.

391
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,333
(<i> as Ihat</i> )
Now, you've done it, Captain.

392
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,417
Masaka is awake.

393
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,333
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

394
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:36,834
Who's this?

395
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,959
I'd say that
that is Masaka.

396
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,917
He had referred
to her as "queen",

397
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,750
and it's not unusual in
ceremonial cultures

398
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,709
to find royalty
symbolized by a sun.

399
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,834
TROI: You said the
personalities inside Data

400
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,667
were in awe of her,
even terrified?

401
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,917
Well, according to Data,
the sun image

402
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,208
is also a symbol
for death.

403
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:10,458
See, there it is again--
the same U-shaped symbol.

404
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,667
Small and insignificant,

405
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:13,792
almost as if it's
an afterthought.

406
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,375
Captain, this is incredible.

407
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,041
These artifacts weren't beamed
here from the archives.

408
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:22,083
The matter here in Ten Forward
has been transformed.

409
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,583
Into living plants?
How is that possible?

410
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:28,667
I'm not sure, but bit by bit,
this ship is being transformed.

411
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,709
WORF: We have been
receiving reports

412
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,417
from the rest
of the ship.

413
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,667
Part of deck 12
is now an aqueduct.

414
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:37,875
What are we being
transformed into?

415
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:40,125
I'm not sure
I wanna find out.

416
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,750
I don't think
we have any choice.

417
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,500
We must destroy that archive,
Mr. Worf.

418
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:48,333
Sir, our weapons control
systems are inoperative.

419
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,417
However, we could
reconfigure

420
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,625
a photon torpedo
for manual launch.

421
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,542
Make it so.

422
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,875
(<i> sighs</i> )

423
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:03,083
There's so much more here
that we could have learned.

424
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:06,375
I really regret losing
that opportunity.

425
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,875
Okay, I've locked in the
targeting parameters.

426
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,750
What's the phase
alignment now?

427
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:14,083
Less than .7%.

428
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,667
Good, that'll do it.

429
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,041
I'm setting the
yield at maximum--

430
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,542
Sir...

431
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,583
the onboard power systems
are not functioning.

432
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,417
Let's see what's
going on here.

433
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,083
(<i> gasps</i> )
Whoa!

434
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:10,458
Something tells me we'd
better get out of here.

435
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,750
Engineering to Bridge.

436
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:25,083
Emergency transport.
Two to beam out.

437
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,625
Maybe we'd better
talk out here.

438
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:40,125
The observation lounge
has turned into a swamp.

439
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:44,709
So... what's our status?

440
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,166
Well, so far, the archive
has transformed

441
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,750
about 20% of the ship.
We've lost main propulsion

442
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:51,500
and the weapons systems
in the process.

443
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:53,625
What about communication?
Sensors? Life-support?

444
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:54,875
We have communications

445
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,125
and limited
sensor control.

446
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,959
Life-support seems
to be unaffected.

447
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,667
I've analyzed the
alien plant forms.

448
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,458
They've developed
from biological matter

449
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,000
we have on the ship.

450
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:07,125
The stone, the artifacts are
made in much the same way--

451
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:09,125
extrapolating from
the ship's own alloys.

452
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,542
CRUSHER: Apparently,
the archive

453
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:11,959
can reorder and transform

454
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,542
molecular structure--
including DNA--

455
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:14,959
into anything it wants.

456
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,166
So, it's using
our ship, our alloys,

457
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,709
our DNA to
create elements

458
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,750
of its own culture.
But why is this happening?

459
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:24,917
What does the archive
hope to accomplish?

460
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:27,208
PICARD: Well, whatever
the intent that lies

461
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,041
behind its process,

462
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,917
I'm not gonna permit
this ship to be turned

463
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,709
into an alien city.

464
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,792
Mr. La Forge,
do you have any ideas?

465
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,250
Well, we still haven't
been able to cut off

466
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,875
that beam,
but I have managed

467
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:39,875
to access the archive by
sending an energy pulse

468
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,458
back along their
signal path.

469
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,792
If I could locate the
transformation program,

470
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,500
I might be able
to control it.

471
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:47,417
That's a good idea.

472
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:50,458
But I feel that the
answer lies there...

473
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,000
with Masaka.

474
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:57,083
We must find her,
access<i> her.</i>

475
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,125
Talk to her.

476
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,834
Hello.

477
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:24,041
(<i> as old man</i> )
Difficult... to stay warm.

478
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,834
It's not warm enough--

479
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:30,834
not for an old man.

480
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,166
Tell me about Masaka.

481
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:38,834
My... daughter.

482
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,667
Tell me, how can I
talk to her?

483
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:48,792
Children... grow...

484
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:51,291
forget their parents.

485
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:55,625
No...

486
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:59,583
Only Korgano can talk

487
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,417
to Masaka.

488
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:04,750
Korgano.
Who is that?

489
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,750
(<i> as Ihat</i> )
Well...

490
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,959
aren't we
the persistent one?

491
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,417
Ihat?

492
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:19,667
Is anyone else so charming?

493
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:22,500
Masaka is taking over
my ship.

494
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:24,500
I told you she would.

495
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,959
I want to
talk with her,

496
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,750
but I understand
that Korgano

497
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:31,500
is the only one
who can do that.

498
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,583
Who told you that?

499
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:38,500
An old man.
Masaka's father.

500
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:41,500
Oh, yes. Yes.

501
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:43,542
Legend has it
she chopped him up

502
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:46,500
and used his bones
to make the world.

503
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,917
Any wonder he doesn't like
to talk about her?

504
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,709
How can I find Korgano?

505
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,667
I don't know.

506
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:54,792
He's not chasing her
anymore.

507
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:56,166
Where has
he gone?

508
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,917
Stop asking me
these questions.

509
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,750
I was fast enough to get
away from her once.

510
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,750
I don't want her
to find me again.

511
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:05,500
I'll wind up on her
sacrificial slab.

512
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:09,125
Ihat, if she's looking
for a sacrifice...

513
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,208
she can take me.

514
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,166
Perhaps then, she'll stop
looking for you.

515
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,625
(<i> chuckling</i> )

516
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,250
Well, there's an idea.

517
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,709
Better you than me.

518
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:24,583
Very well.

519
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,125
What do we do?

520
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,917
You must build
Masaka's temple.

521
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:35,250
The queen's temple.

522
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,709
That will get
her attention.

523
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,583
Very well.
How do I do that?

524
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,959
You need the sign.

525
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,709
I could give it to you.
So could the old man.

526
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,709
But just try
getting it out of him.

527
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,625
Give me the sign.

528
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:52,041
If she finds out...

529
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:56,208
you can't imagine her rage.

530
00:28:57,709 --> 00:29:01,542
She lets people...
die of thirst.

531
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:06,250
A terrible death.

532
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:10,792
Sometimes...
she burns them alive.

533
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,959
She is glorious.

534
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,542
Ihat, the sign.
Give it to me.

535
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:23,750
If she comes,
you will take my place?

536
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,000
Yes.

537
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,291
All right.

538
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,333
Quickly, give me your hand.

539
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:34,166
A line, as the
unending horizon.

540
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:37,291
A curve as...

541
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,709
She has found me.

542
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,959
Masaka, show yourself.

543
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,166
I will go
with you.

544
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:51,709
It seems...
I was not fast enough.

545
00:29:56,834 --> 00:30:01,166
(<i> as old man</i> )
So hard... to stay warm.

546
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,458
(<i> groans</i> )

547
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,417
Are you one of my children?

548
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:09,166
I can't remember
anymore.

549
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,917
I need your help.

550
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,542
I need the sign
for the temple.

551
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:15,333
For Masaka's temple.

552
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,917
It won't help you.

553
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:22,542
Korgano no longer
pursues her.

554
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:26,125
Only he can stop her.

555
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,959
A line, as the
unending horizon.

556
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:40,875
A curve as...

557
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:48,875
A line, as the
unending horizon.

558
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:51,041
A curve...

559
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:55,625
As... the rolling
hillside.

560
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:59,875
A point...
as a distant bird.

561
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:05,834
A ray...
as the rising sun.

562
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,333
Thank you.

563
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:15,875
Now... come sit with me.

564
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,458
Tend the fire.

565
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:30,875
(<i> faint voice</i> )
I'm alone.

566
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:33,417
No one left to help me.

567
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,250
She's coming.

568
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,792
Are all the others dead?

569
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:39,917
Did Masaka kill them?

570
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,125
No.

571
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,792
She sent them away.

572
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:46,333
It will take them
days to die.

573
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:22,625
PICARD:
Any progress, Mr. La Forge?

574
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:25,875
I think I've found the archive's
transformation program.

575
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:28,041
Will it accept the symbol
for Masaka's temple?

576
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,417
I think so.

577
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,542
I've isolated the program's
input pathways--

578
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,542
their key to
accept symbols.

579
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,333
If I input this one,

580
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:38,041
it should initiate
the transformation program.

581
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,458
And create the temple?

582
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,834
Well, I hope so.

583
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,417
If this is the wrong symbol,
it might turn

584
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:45,166
the<i> Enterprise</i>
into a big chunk of rock.

585
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,500
No way to know for sure.

586
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:49,250
The question is,
can we trust a personality

587
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:51,709
from an alien archive
that seems bent

588
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,625
on taking us over?

589
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:56,500
Ihat risked his life
to show me that symbol.

590
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:59,625
And Masaka killed him
for doing it.

591
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,083
I think we have to risk it.

592
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,625
Captain, the entire deck has
been cleared of personnel.

593
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,500
We may proceed.

594
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:13,792
Commander Riker,
we're ready.

595
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:15,625
RIKER:
Understood.

596
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:18,333
Initiate transformation.

597
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,542
Inputting the
symbol now.

598
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:31,291
It would seem that this
is Masaka's temple.

599
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,750
There is
no one else here.

600
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:37,041
PICARD: Ihat said that
if we created the temple,

601
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:40,125
then it would get
her attention.

602
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:43,125
It may be some time
before she shows herself.

603
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,375
WORF:
How will she do that?

604
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:47,458
PICARD:
I don't know.

605
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:52,917
Captain?

606
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:55,166
Take a look at this.

607
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:06,542
This is the first time

608
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,875
I've seen these
two symbols paired.

609
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:10,417
That could be significant.

610
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,458
Look, there it is again.

611
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,834
And again.

612
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,750
And there, again.

613
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,500
This is obviously an
important pairing.

614
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:31,625
He isn't chasing
her anymore.

615
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:33,083
Sir?

616
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:36,041
Ihat said that someone
called Korgano

617
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,875
isn't chasing Masaka anymore.

618
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:43,625
And the old man said,
"He pursues her no longer."

619
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:48,583
In a sense,
the small symbol

620
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:51,500
might be seen to be
chasing Masaka.

621
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:54,250
The symbol
suggests antlers

622
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,542
of some kind--
uh, horns.

623
00:34:56,583 --> 00:35:00,250
Maybe it is meant to
represent an animal?

624
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:02,959
Animals are worshipped
in many cultures.

625
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,125
That smaller symbol
could represent Korgano.

626
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:10,125
Ihat and the old man
said that Korgano

627
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,875
was the only one who
could control Masaka.

628
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:16,083
Many ritualistic cultures

629
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:20,041
incorporate the idea of balance
into their belief systems.

630
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:25,041
Now, Masaka is a... queen,

631
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:28,417
a powerful godlike figure.

632
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:32,417
It's not unrealistic

633
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:35,500
to believe that she might
have a counterpart--

634
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,166
a consort.

635
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,583
Look around,
see if you can see

636
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,625
that horn-like symbol
anywhere else.

637
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:38,083
TROI: This is the
most prominent instance

638
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,125
of the horn symbol
we've seen yet.

639
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,208
WORF: But now,
it appears as though

640
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,834
Masaka's sun
is chasing it.

641
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,959
TROI: The sun
chasing an animal?

642
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,834
Maybe it's
simpler than that.

643
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,125
Maybe their relationship
is more like...

644
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,875
the sun and the moon.

645
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:54,667
I see.

646
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:58,625
Masaka and Korgano
switching positions.

647
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,375
The sun setting,
and the moon rising.

648
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:03,500
Exactly, like two
powerful rulers

649
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:06,041
changing places in
a continual cycle.

650
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:07,667
And like the sun
and the moon,

651
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:09,625
only one of them can
be in ascendance

652
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:10,959
at any given time.

653
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,625
(<i> sighs</i> )
If we can find Korgano

654
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:17,208
in the archive and
bring him out,

655
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,959
then perhaps he could
force Masaka to leave.

656
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,250
But would we be
better off with him?

657
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:27,583
Hmm.
Ihat and the others

658
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,083
didn't seem to be
frightened of Korgano.

659
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,667
Sir?

660
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:37,959
Masaka.

661
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,792
Masaka...

662
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,458
I'm Captain
Jean-Luc Picard

663
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,917
of the Federation
Starship--

664
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,625
Go away!

665
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:54,667
Please, hear us.

666
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,625
Your archive
is destroying--

667
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:01,208
I do not hear you!

668
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,125
She will not even
listen to us.

669
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,083
Then we will have to
find someone to whom

670
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,917
she will listen.

671
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,291
I found it, Captain.

672
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,083
This is the only place
in the archive

673
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,041
where Korgano's
moon symbol appears

674
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:22,083
by itself, not linked
with Masaka's.

675
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,000
All right, Mr. La Forge,
I want you to access

676
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,625
the transformation program,

677
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,834
and when you're ready,
input the symbol.

678
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,417
Isn't that a
little risky?

679
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,417
TROI: We have no idea
what the result would be.

680
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:33,000
The symbol might
generate anything

681
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:35,750
from Korgano's temple
to Korgano himself.

682
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:39,667
In one sense, Korgano
is Masaka's nemesis.

683
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:41,709
And whatever this
symbol represents,

684
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,333
it could be, for us,
a means to control her.

685
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:46,041
Now, if anyone
has a better idea,

686
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm very happy to
entertain it.

687
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,792
I've accessed
the program, Captain.

688
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:52,625
Initiate the
transformation.

689
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,583
Another mask.

690
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:13,166
You know, we could be going
about this all the wrong way.

691
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,875
This is a very
ritualistic culture--

692
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:19,125
one based on symbol
and myth.

693
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:22,208
Perhaps we should try to
confront them on those terms.

694
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:26,875
If I could somehow incorporate
myself in their ritual...

695
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:30,875
then perhaps Masaka
would listen to me.

696
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:33,583
You're going to try
to pose as Korgano?

697
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:35,917
Captain, we know so little
about this culture,

698
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,750
and even less
about Korgano.

699
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:41,709
How would you convince
Masaka that you're him?

700
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,834
Well, I'm really
not certain.

701
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,417
But there are similarities

702
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,583
between this culture and
others that I've studied.

703
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,750
I would imagine
I'm just going to improvise.

704
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:51,333
Mr. Worf, what's our status?

705
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,375
I estimate we have
less than two hours

706
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:56,500
before there is nothing left
of the ship-- at least nothing

707
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:58,542
we can recognize.

708
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,792
Masaka?

709
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,834
Korgano.

710
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,583
Are you surprised to see me?

711
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:35,875
I thought I had
escaped you.

712
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:39,333
You should know
that is impossible.

713
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,834
You are a fine hunter...

714
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,583
but I am
a powerful prey.

715
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,500
You will never catch me.

716
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:50,208
Do you want to be
the prey forever?

717
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,250
I thought I was alone.

718
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,667
I thought I would not have
to share the sky with you.

719
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:08,041
But without me,
you are not complete.

720
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,625
I know you so well.

721
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:15,041
You live for the
chase, as do I.

722
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:18,959
Will you not miss
being the hunter?

723
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,375
Pursuing me?

724
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:22,834
Forcing me
from the sky

725
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:25,500
so that you can
rise again?

726
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:28,083
You know me well, Korgano.

727
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:30,417
I think...

728
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:32,834
that you are beginning
to tire.

729
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,166
It is difficult

730
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:37,667
brightening the
sky forever.

731
00:41:37,709 --> 00:41:40,000
Mmm.

732
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,375
I<i> am</i> getting sleepy.

733
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,667
You always do that to me.

734
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:52,166
So that you can wake
with the dawn.

735
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,667
And begin the hunt again.

736
00:41:57,959 --> 00:42:00,500
Let the hunt begin again.

737
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,709
I am eager for that.

738
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:22,208
As am I.

739
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:28,000
Riker to Picard.
I don't know what you did, sir,

740
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,875
but it looks like everything's
back to normal.

741
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:31,458
Acknowledged.

742
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:35,959
Mr. Data,
you all right?

743
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,041
I believe so, sir.

744
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:40,750
I am not entirely certain
what has happened.

745
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,625
Have I been
dreaming again?

746
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:45,333
I'm afraid that will take
some time to explain.

747
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,125
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47618.4.</i>

748
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,375
<i>Commander La Forge has managed</i>
<i>to disable</i>

749
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:55,917
<i>the alien</i>
<i>transformation program.</i>

750
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:58,583
<i>Starfleet has dispatched</i>
<i>an archeological team</i>

751
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,959
<i>to study the archive further.</i>

752
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,291
PICARD:
But I don't understand.

753
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,750
I thought all of
the alien artifacts

754
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:05,333
had disappeared from
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

755
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,583
That one was not created
by the archive, sir.

756
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:11,000
That is the clay mask
I originally made.

757
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:12,333
I have since
painted it.

758
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,500
A memento?
Yes, sir.

759
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:16,875
Although I am...

760
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:20,166
relieved to be rid of
those alien personalities,

761
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:23,875
in a sense, I am now... empty.

762
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:26,041
Hmm. I can imagine.

763
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:29,333
Dr. Crusher told me that
there were possibly dozens

764
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:31,041
of personalities inside you.

765
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:33,667
I suspect the number
was much greater.

766
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:35,709
My impression is that
there were thousands,

767
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,333
of all ages and
walks of life.

768
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:41,417
It was
a remarkable experience.

769
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:45,709
Well, Data, you never may
become fully human,

770
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,166
but you've had an experience

771
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,750
that transcends the
human condition.

772
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:54,125
You've been an
entire civilization.
