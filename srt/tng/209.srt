<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42523.7.</i>

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,333
<i>We are en route</i>

3
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:11,291
<i>to the newly established</i>
<i>Starbase 173 for port call.</i>

4
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,917
<i>Crew rotation is scheduled</i>

5
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:16,291
<i>and we will be off-loading</i>
<i>experiment modules.</i>

6
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,208
Hold it.
That's my chair.

7
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,458
My luck is
always lousy

8
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,291
unless I start
on the dealer's right.

9
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,125
That would seem to be
superstition.

10
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,834
Bitter experience
has taught me

11
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:27,667
it's a fundamental
truth.

12
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,041
Okay. The game is
five-card stud

13
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,041
nothing wild.

14
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,333
Ante up.

15
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,208
This game is
exceedingly simple.

16
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,667
With only 52 cards,
21 of which I will see

17
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,166
and four other players

18
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,500
there are a limited number
of winning combinations.

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,875
There's more to this
than just the cards, Data.

20
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,583
But of course.

21
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,417
The bets will indicate the
relative strength of each hand.

22
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:49,583
Time to pluck a pigeon.

23
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,125
Five.

24
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,542
I'm in.

25
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:57,625
I, too.

26
00:00:58,583 --> 00:00:59,583
Mm-hmm.

27
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,041
Call.

28
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,250
A seven
and a six.

29
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,375
Ladies.

30
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,375
I bet ten.

31
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,417
I'll see that.

32
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,417
Call.

33
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:15,625
Fold.

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,125
Yeah, me, too.
I'm out.

35
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,083
I bet five.

36
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,625
I'll see it.

37
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:37,083
Your five and five.

38
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,959
Too rich for me.

39
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,000
No help.

40
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,333
(<i> players oohing</i> )

41
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,500
I bet ten.

42
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,125
Your ten and ten.

43
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,458
Is that what is known
as a poker face?

44
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,083
Are you playing or not?

45
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,792
I fold.

46
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,834
(<i> groans and laughter</i> )

47
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,208
You had nothing.

48
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,917
He bluffed you, Data.

49
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,875
It makes very little sense
to bet when you cannot win.

50
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,250
But I did win.

51
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,709
I was betting
that you wouldn't call.

52
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,959
How could you tell?

53
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,250
PULASKI:
Instinct, Data.

54
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,959
Instinct.

55
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,458
The game is seven-card high/low
with a buy on the last card.

56
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,500
And just to make it
more interesting

57
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,667
the man with the ax takes all.

58
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,583
My god.

It's been ten years

62
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,667
but seeing you
again like this

63
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,250
makes it seem like 50.

64
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,083
If we weren't around
all these people

65
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,333
do you know what
I would like to do?

66
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,959
Bust a chair
across my teeth?

67
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:34,959
After that.

I have no staff,

And, hopefully, we can make
some good law out here.

Anything is possible.

82
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,250
So you came back

Still the most

00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,625
You had no reason

Mm.

87

No, that was your own
damn stubborn pride.

When I prosecuted you
in the<i> Stargazer</i> court-martial

You enjoyed it.

92
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,417
Not true.

93
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,917
A court-martial
is standard procedure

94
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:00,917
when a ship is lost.

95
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,333
I was doing my duty

00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,291
as an officer of the Judge
Advocate General.

97
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,458
You always enjoyed
the adversarial process

98
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,041
more than getting
at the truth.

99
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,125
Well, I hope that you've learned
a little wisdom along the way.

100

You know, I never thought
I would say this

but it's good to see you again.

102
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:32,458
It brings a sense of order
and stability to my universe

103
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,083
to know that you're still
a pompous ass.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,709

Oh, yes.

Excuse me.

111

112
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,959
You can

May I present

116
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,667
Commander.

117
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,375
He has an interesting
proposal for you,

118
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,834
but that can wait for awhile.

119
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,834
I'm eager to see the<i> Enterprise.</i>

120
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:15,375
Yes, sir.
This way.

121
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,667
RIKER:
Admiral
on the Bridge.

122
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,250
I was a little surprised
at the decision

123
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,542
to put a base in force

124
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,291
so close
to the Neutral Zone.

125
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,917
ADMIRAL:
As you know, we've
had disturbing news

126
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:37,000
from both sides of the zone.

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,041
We're here to respond
when needed.

128
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,709
And it won't hurt
to have the Romulans know

129
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:42,458
that we're nearby.

130
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:48,333
Ah. Well, Captain, I want to
thank you for this opportunity.

131
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,750
For 500 years, every ship

132
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,458
that has born the name
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

133
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,583
has become a legend.

134
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,875
This one is no different.

135
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,625
Admiral.

136
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,208
Ah, yes.

137
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,667
Captain, Commander Maddox is
here to work on your android.

138
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:01,750
Please take care of him.

139
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,959
How have you been, Data?

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,250
My condition does not alter

141
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,625
with the passage of time,
Commander.

142
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,500
Are the two of you
acquainted?

143
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,792
Yes, I evaluated Data

144
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:18,875
when it first applied
to the academy.

145
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,959
And was the sole member of the
committee to oppose my entrance

146
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,250
on the grounds
that I was not a sentient being.

147
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,917
What exactly will
this work entail?

148
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,792
I am going
to disassemble Data.

149
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,417
All right,
explain this procedure.

150
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,166
(<i> clears throat</i> )

151
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,875
Ever since
I first saw Data

152
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,083
at the entrance
evaluation

153
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,458
at the Starfleet Academy

154
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,667
I've wanted
to understand it.

155
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,417
I became a student of the works

156
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:50,792
of Dr. Noonien Soong,
Data's creator

157
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:54,083
and I've tried
to continue his work.

158
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,417
I believe I am very close
to the breakthrough

159
00:08:56,417 --> 00:09:00,834
that will enable me
to duplicate Dr. Soong's work

160
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:03,750
and replicate this.

161
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,041
But, as a first step I must
disassemble and study it.

162
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,959
Data is going to be my guide.

163
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:16,750
Data?

164
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,041
It sounds intriguing.

165
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,208
How will you proceed?

166
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,542
I will run a full
diagnostic on Data

167
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,875
evaluating the condition
of its current software.

168
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,250
I will then dump its core memory

169
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,166
into the Starbase
mainframe computer

170
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,291
and begin a
detailed analysis
of its construction.

171
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,125
You've constructed
a positronic brain?

172
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,792
Yes.

173
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,500
Have you determined how
the electron resistance

174
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,834
across the neural filaments
is to be resolved?

175
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,542
Not precisely.

176
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:52,166
That would seem to be
a necessary first step.

177
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,500
I am confident
that I will find the answer

178
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,083
once I examine
the filament links

179
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,000
in your anterior cortex.

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,333
But, if the answer
is not forthcoming

181
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,625
your model will
not function.

182
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,542
I do not anticipate
any problems.

183
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,083
You seem a little vague
on the specifics.

184
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,458
What are the risks
to Commander Data?

185
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,417
Negligible.

186
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,375
Captain, I believe
his basic research

187
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,625
lacks the specifics necessary

188
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,917
to support
an experiment

189
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,250
of this
magnitude.

190
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:31,166
Commander Data is a valued
member of my Bridge crew.

191
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,583
Based on what I've heard,
I cannot allow Commander Data

192
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,000
to submit himself
to this experiment.

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,959
I was afraid this might be
your attitude, Captain.

194
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,083
Here are Starfleet's
transfer orders

195
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,417
separating Commander Data
from the<i> Enterprise</i>

196
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:48,709
and reassigning it
to Starbase 173

197
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:49,792
under my command.

198
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,208
Data, I will see you
in my office tomorrow

199
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,542
at 0900 hours.

200
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:10,792
(<i> door chimes</i> )

201
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,291
Come.

202
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,000
You sent for me, sir?

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,458
Data, please sit down.

204
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,500
Well, we have
a problem.

205
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,875
I find myself
in complete agreement

206
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,583
with that assessment
of the situation, sir.

207
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,667
Your service to this ship
has been exemplary.

208
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,417
I don't want to lose you.

209
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,208
I will not submit
to the procedure, sir.

210
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,333
Data...

211
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,750
I understand
your objections,

212
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,875
but I have to consider
Starfleet's interests.

213
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,500
What if Commander Maddox
is correct?

214
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,667
There is a possibility

215
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:11,208
that many more beings
like yourself

216
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,458
can be constructed.

217
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,542
Sir, Lieutenant La Forge's eyes

218
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:20,083
are far superior
to human biological eyes, true?

219
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,000
Mm-hmm.

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,917
Then why are not all
human officers required

221
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,750
to have their eyes replaced
with cybernetic implants?

222
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,000
I see.

223
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It is precisely because
I am not human.

224
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,709
That will be all, Mr. Data.

225
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,959
Computer, pull
all relevant information

226
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,959
with regard
to Starfleet regulations

227
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,875
on the transfer of officers.

228
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,917
COMPUTER:
Working.

229
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,875
My God.

230
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,500
Twice in as many days.

231
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,959
I need your help.

232
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:20,083
An historic moment.

233
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,166
I have been trying to make sense
of this gobbledygook,

234
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,917
but it's beyond me.

235
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:27,083
The fact is,
my android officer, Data,

236
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,250
is being transferred
compulsorily

237
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,375
to be made part
of a highly dangerous

238
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,875
and ill-conceived experiment,
and I want it stopped.

239
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,917
He can refuse
to undergo the procedure

240
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,458
but we can't stop
the transfer.

241
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,625
Once this Maddox has...

242
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,083
got control
of Data

243
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,333
anything could happen.

244
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,917
I don't trust that man.

245
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,917
We agree to certain risks
when we join Starfleet.

246
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,667
Yes, acceptable risks,
justified risks

247
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,750
but I can't accept this.

248
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,250
It's unjustified.
It's unfair.

249
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,458
He has rights.

250
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,917
All this passion over a machine?

251
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,458
Don't start.

252
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,333
This is
important to me.

253
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,375
Is there an option?

254
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,041
There is always an option.

255
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,417
He can resign.

256
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,041
I see.

257
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,583
So you came to me for help.

258
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,458
Yes, I came to you.

259
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,333
You're the JAG Officer
for this sector.

260
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,875
I had no choice
but to come to you.

261
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,333
Wait.

262
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:35,083
I didn't mean it that way.

263
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,458
I'm glad you
felt you could...

264
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,333
well, come to me.

265
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:43,166
The word "trust" just isn't
in your vocabulary, is it?

266
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,000
Good try--
nine out of ten for effort.

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,041
I wish things were different.

268
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:49,750
I wish I could believe that.

269
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,583
"When in disgrace
with fortune and men's eyes

270
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,917
I all alone beweep
my outcast state."

271
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,291
Is it just words to you?

272
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,291
Or do you fathom the meaning?

273
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,458
Is it not customary
to request permission

274
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,458
before entering
an individual's quarters?

275
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,667
I thought that we
could talk this out.

276
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,625
That I could try
to persuade you.

277
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,709
Your memories and knowledge
will remain intact.

278
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:39,417
Reduced to the mere
facts of the events.

279
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:42,917
The substance, the
flavor of the moment
could be lost.

280
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Take games of chance...

281
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,709
Games of chance?

282
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:51,542
Yes, I had read and absorbed

283
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:53,792
every treatise and textbook
on the subject

284
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:56,709
and found myself well prepared
for the experience.

285
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:59,375
Yet, when I finally
played poker

286
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,792
I discovered
that the reality

287
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:04,333
bore little resemblance
to the rules.

288
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,959
And the point being?

289
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,583
That, while I believe
it is possible

290
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,834
to download information
contained in a positronic brain

291
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:13,709
I do not believe you have
acquired the expertise necessary

292
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,709
to preserve the essence
of those experiences.

293
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,750
There is an ineffable
quality to memory

294
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,834
which I do not believe
can survive your procedure.

295
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,375
"Ineffable quality."

296
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,792
I had rather we had
done this together

297
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:35,959
but, one way or the other,
we are doing it.

298
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,667
You're under my command.

299
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,083
No, sir.

300
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,291
I am not under yours
nor anyone else's command.

301
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,375
I have resigned from Starfleet.

302
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,458
Resigned?

303
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,166
You can't resign.

304
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,041
I regret the decision,
but I must.

305
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,000
I am the culmination
of one man's dream.

306
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,291
This is not ego
or vanity,

307
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,458
but when Dr. Soong created me

308
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,375
he added to the substance
of the universe.

309
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,125
If, by your experiments,
I am destroyed

310
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,709
something unique, something
wonderful will be lost.

311
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,875
I cannot permit that.

312
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:16,333
I must protect
his dream.

313
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,083
And so must I.

314
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,959
But keep packing

315
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,125
because one way
or the other

316
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,041
you will be reporting.

317
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,709
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

318
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:36,875
<i>Commander Bruce Maddox,</i>
<i>having been thwarted</i>

319
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,667
<i>by Data's abrupt resignation,</i>

320
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,583
<i>is now seeking a legal remedy</i>
<i>for his woes.</i>

321
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,083
<i>Captain Louvois</i>
<i>has requested my presence</i>

322
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,250
<i>at those discussions.</i>

323
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,458
Your response is
emotional and irrational.

324
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,041
Irrational?
You are endowing Data
with human characteristics

325
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,792
because it looks human,
but it is not.

326
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:56,041
If it were a box on wheels

327
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,000
I would not be facing
this opposition.

328
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,333
Overt sentimentality is not one
of Captain Picard's failings.

329
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,917
Trust me, I know.

330
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,583
I will tell you again.

331
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,375
Data is a valued
member of my crew.

332
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,375
He's an outstanding
Bridge Officer.

333
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,709
If I am permitted to make
this experiment, the horizons

334
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:16,417
for human achievement
become boundless.

335
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:19,667
Consider, every
ship in Starfleet

336
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,208
with a Data on board.

337
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,792
Utilizing its
extraordinary capabilities,

338
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:27,709
acting as our hands and eyes
in dangerous situations.

339
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,875
Look, you're preaching
to the choir, here.

340
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,041
Why don't you get to the point?

341
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,583
Data must not be
permitted to resign.

342
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,333
Data is
a Starfleet Officer.

343
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,667
He still has
certain rights.

344
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:37,959
Rights, rights!

345
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,667
I'm sick to death
of hearing about rights.

346
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,875
What about my right
not to have my life work

347
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,875
subverted
by blind ignorance?

348
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,041
We have rule of law

349
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,166
in this Federation.

350
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,875
You cannot simply
seize people

351
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,917
and experiment with them
to prove your pet theories.

352
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:50,917
Thank you.

353
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:52,333
MADDOX:
Now you're
doing it.

354
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,792
Data is an extraordinary
piece of engineering

355
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:56,458
but it is a machine.

356
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,375
If you permit it
to resign

357
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,917
it will destroy years
of work in robotics.

358
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:04,208
Starfleet does not have
to allow the resignation.

359
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,792
Commander, who do you think
you're working for?

360
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,917
Starfleet is not an organization
that ignores

361
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:12,125
it's own regulations
when they become inconvenient.

362
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,750
Whether you like it or not,
Data does have rights.

363
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:18,792
Let me put it
another way.

364
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,875
Would you permit the computer
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

365
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,000
to refuse a refit?

366
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,125
That's an interesting point.

367
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,417
But the<i> Enterprise</i> computer
is property.

368
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,542
Is Data?

369
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,333
Of course.

370
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,583
<i>( sighing )</i> There may be law
to support this position.

371
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,000
Then find it.

372
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,500
A ruling with such
broad-ranging implications

373
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,834
must be supported.

374
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,542
Phillipa...

375
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,500
I hope you will use
the same zeal

376
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,041
that you did in
the<i> Stargazer</i> court-martial.

377
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,375
Data, you're supposed
to rip the wrapping off.

378
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:04,375
With the application
of a little care, Wes,

379
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:08,000
the paper can be
utilized again.

380
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,875
Data, you're missing
the point.

381
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,291
<i>The Dream of the Fire</i>
by K'Ratak.

382
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,458
Thank you, Worf.

383
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,083
It was in the hands
of the Klingons

384
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,083
that the novel attained
its full stature.

385
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,917
I couldn't disagree more

386
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:27,959
but we'll save that argument

387
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,291
for another day.

388
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,417
DATA:
Excuse me, please.

389
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,208
Is something wrong?

390
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,208
Of course there is.

391
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,917
You're going away.

392
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:43,875
No one regrets that necessity
more than myself,

393
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,667
but you do understand
my reasons?

394
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,500
Sure, I understand.

395
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,542
I just don't like
you being forced out.

396
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:52,625
It's not fair.

397
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:59,000
As Dr. Pulaski would, at this
junction, no doubt remind us

398
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,083
"life is rarely fair."

399
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,083
Sorry, that just doesn't
make it any better.

400
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,250
I shall miss you, Geordi.

401
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,834
Yeah.

402
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:13,583
Me, too.

403
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,208
Take care of yourself, Data.

404
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,083
I have completed my research.

405
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,834
Based on the Acts of Cumberland
passed in the early 21st century

406
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,375
Data is the property
of Starfleet.

407
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,041
He cannot resign
and he cannot refuse

408
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,583
to cooperate with
Commander Maddox.

409
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,625
What if I challenge
this ruling?

410
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,583
Then I shall be required
to hold a hearing.

411
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,625
Then I so challenge.

412
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,000
Convene
your hearing.

413
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,458
Captain, that would be
exceedingly difficult.

414
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:52,709
This is a new base.

415
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:54,834
I have no staff.

416
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:57,875
Surely, Captain,
you have regulations

417
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,959
to take care
of such an eventuality.

418
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,834
There are.

419
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:04,959
I can use serving
officers as legal counsel.

420
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:07,208
You, as the senior officer,
would defend.

421
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,375
Very good.

422
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:13,041
And the unenviable task
of prosecuting this case

423
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,250
would fall on you, Commander

424
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,834
as the next most
senior officer

425
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,291
of the defendant's ship.

426
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,250
I can't.

427
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,542
I won't.

428
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,667
Data's my comrade.
We have served together.

429
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:27,583
I not only respect him,
I consider him my friend.

430
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:31,333
When people of good conscience
have an honest dispute

431
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,291
we must still sometimes resort

432
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,417
to this kind
of adversarial system.

433
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:38,542
You just want me to prove
that Data is a mere machine.

434
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,709
I can't do that,
because I don't believe it.

435
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:42,041
I happen to
know better

436
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,375
so I am neither
qualified

437
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,291
nor willing.

438
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,000
You're going to have
to find someone else.

439
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,458
Then I will rule summarily
based on my findings.

440
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,500
Data is a toaster.

441
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,375
Have him report immediately
to Commander Maddox

442
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,041
for experimental refit.

443
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:01,834
I see.

444
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:03,959
I have no choice
but to agree.

445
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:07,917
Good, and I expect you to do
your duty in that courtroom.

446
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:09,291
If I find for one minute

447
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,417
that you are not
doing your best

448
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,375
I will end this, then and there.

449
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,875
You don't have to remind us
of our duty.

450
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:23,208
You just...

451
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:25,667
just remember yours.

452
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,625
I have never forgotten it.

453
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:31,125
Not then,
and certainly not now.

454
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,083
(<i> door chimes</i> )

455
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,125
Come.

456
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:49,375
Data...

457
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,792
Captain Louvois
has issued a ruling.

458
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:53,125
You are the property
of Starfleet Command.

459
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,166
You cannot resign.

460
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,208
I see.

461
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,500
From limitless options

462
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,917
I am reduced to none,
or rather one.

463
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:04,500
I can only hope
that Commander Maddox

464
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
is more capable than
it would appear.

465
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,709
Data, you're not
going to submit.

466
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,250
We are going
to fight this.

467
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,291
I've challenged the ruling.

468
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,959
Captain Louvois will be
compelled to convene a hearing.

469
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,834
She may be overly attached
to the letter of the law

470
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:20,542
but I suspect that she still
understands its spirit.

471
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:22,041
We will put to rest

472
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,625
this question of your legal
status once and for all.

473
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,125
Now, I have been asked
to represent you

474
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,542
but if there is
some other officer

475
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,125
with which you would feel
more happy...

476
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:32,417
Captain, I have complete
confidence in your ability

477
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:33,959
to represent my interests.

478
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:52,166
Computer,

Working.

486
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,792
This hearing,

487
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:39,917
convened
on Stardate 42527.4

488
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:43,125
is to determine the legal status
of the android known as Data.

489
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,333
The Office
of Judge Advocate General

490
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,917
has rendered a finding
of property.

491
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,750
The defense has challenged.

492
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,000
Commander Riker?

493
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,792
Your Honor, there
is only one issue

494
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:54,000
and one relevant
piece of evidence.

495
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,625
I call Lieutenant
Commander Data.

496
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,166
COMPUTER:
Verify Lieutenant
Commander Data.

497
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:11,500
Current assignment:

498
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,041
Starfleet Command
decoration for valor.

499
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,625
Your Honor, we'll
stipulate to all of this.

500
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,917
Objection, Your Honor.

501
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,375
I want this read.

502
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,375
All of it.

503
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,375
Sustained.

504
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:27,208
...valor and gallantry,
Medal of Honor with clusters

505
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,917
Legion of Honor, the Star Cross.

506
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,208
LOUVOIS:
Proceed,
Commander.

507
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,834
Commander,
what are you?

508
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,375
An android.

509
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:43,959
Which is?

510
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:46,917
Webster's<i> 24th Century</i>
<i>Dictionary,</i> Fifth Edition,

511
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:49,125
defines an android
as an automaton

512
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,208
made to resemble a human being.

513
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,125
"An automaton."

514
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:55,041
Made by whom?

515
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:57,417
Sir?

516
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,709
Who built you, Commander?

517
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:00,458
Dr. Noonien Soong.

518
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,667
And he was?

519
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,875
The foremost authority
on cybernetics.

520
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,583
More basic than that.

521
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:06,667
What was he?

522
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:12,208
Human?

523
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,625
Thank you.

524
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,291
Commander, what is the capacity
of your memory

525
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:19,709
and how fast can you
access information?

526
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,458
I have
an ultimate storage capacity

527
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,583
of 800 quadrillion bits.

528
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,333
My total linear computational
speed has been rated

529
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,792
at 60 trillion operations
per second.

530
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,125
Your Honor, I offer
into evidence

531
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,667
Prosecution's Exhibit "A."

532
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:40,166
A rod of parsteel,

533
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:43,750
tensile strength 40 kilo-bars.

534
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,458
Commander, would
you bend that?

535
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:50,583
PICARD:
Objection.

536
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:51,959
There are many
life-forms possessed

537
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,542
with megastrength.

538
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:55,166
These issues are not relevant
to this hearing.

539
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,375
I'm afraid
I can't agree, Captain.

540
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,333
Proceed with your demonstration,
Commander.

541
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,917
Drawing on the log
of the construction

542
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:20,458
of the prototype android Lore

543
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,333
also constructed
by Noonien Soong

544
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:25,917
I request to be allowed

545
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,583
to remove the Commander's hand

546
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,625
for your inspection.

547
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,959
Objection.

548
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:36,583
It doesn't matter.

549
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,291
Objection withdrawn.

550
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,750
Proceed, Commander.

551
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:51,625
I'm sorry.

552
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:14,583
The Commander is a physical
representation of a dream

553
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:18,458
an idea conceived of
by the mind of a man.

554
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:22,709
Its purpose-- to serve human
needs and interests.

555
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:25,041
It's a collection
of neural nets

556
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:27,542
and heuristic algorithms.

557
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:32,542
Its responses dictated
by an elaborate software

558
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:33,667
written by a man.

559
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,083
Its hardware built

560
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,583
by a man.

561
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:39,166
And now...

562
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,875
And now a man
will shut it off.

563
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,750
Pinocchio is broken.

564
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,709
Its strings have been cut.

565
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,083
I request a recess.

566
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,625
Granted.

567
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,834
Do you mean his argument
was that good?

568
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:30,375
Riker's presentation
was devastating.

569
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,583
He almost convinced me.

570
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:34,667
Well, you've got
the harder argument.

571
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,875
By his own admission
Data is a machine.

572
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,583
Mm-hmm, that's true.

573
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:43,125
You're worried about
what's going to
happen to him?

574
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,834
No.

575
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:47,542
I've had to send people
on far more dangerous missions.

576
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,083
Well, then this should
work out fine.

577
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,291
Maddox could get lucky

578
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,125
and create a whole
army of Datas--

579
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,917
all very valuable.

580
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,834
Oh, yes, no doubt.

581
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,542
He's proved
his value to you.

582
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:08,375
In ways that I cannot even begin
to calculate.

583
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:14,291
And now he's about to be ruled
the property of Starfleet.

584
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,041
That should increase his value.

585
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,875
In what way?

586
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:25,375
Well, consider that,
in the history of many worlds

587
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:28,875
there have always been
disposable creatures.

588
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,625
They do the dirty work.

589
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,792
They do the work
that no one else wants to do

590
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,792
because it's too difficult
or too hazardous.

591
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:39,000
And an army of Datas,
all disposable...

592
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,375
You don't have to think
about their welfare.

593
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,834
You don't think
about how they feel.

594
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:48,667
Whole generations
of disposable people.

595
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,250
You're talking about slavery.

596
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,792
Oh, I think
that's a little harsh.

597
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,542
I don't think that's
a little harsh.

598
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:05,041
I think that's the truth.

599
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,917
But that's a truth
that we have obscured

600
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:10,458
behind a comfortable,

601
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,625
easy euphemism--

602
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,291
property.

603
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:19,250
But that's not the issue
at all, is it?

604
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:30,041
PICARD:
Commander Riker has
dramatically demonstrated

605
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,458
to this court

606
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:35,583
that Lieutenant Commander Data
is a machine.

607
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:36,834
Do we deny that?

608
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:39,834
No, because it is not relevant.

609
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:41,542
We, too, are machines,

610
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:45,208
just machines
of a different type.

611
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:48,291
Commander Riker
has also reminded us

612
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:52,250
that Lieutenant Commander
Data was created by a human.

613
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,375
Do we deny that? No.

614
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,959
Again, it is not relevant.

615
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,625
Children are created

616
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:02,500
from the building blocks
of their parents' DNA.

617
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,166
Are they property?

618
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:10,917
I call Lieutenant Commander
Data to the stand.

619
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,041
What are these?

620
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,875
My medals.

621
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,125
Why do you pack them?

622
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,792
What logical purpose
do they serve?

623
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:37,000
I do not know, sir.

624
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,041
I suppose none.

625
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,250
I just wanted them.

626
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,709
Is that vanity?

627
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,917
And this?

628
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:48,625
A gift
from you, sir.

629
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:49,792
You value it?

630
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:50,875
Yes, sir.

631
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,208
Why?

632
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:55,375
It is a reminder
of friendship and service.

633
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,959
And this?

634
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:14,625
You have no other portraits
of your fellow crew members.

635
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,125
Why this person?

636
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,625
I would prefer not
to answer that question, sir.

637
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,792
I gave my word.

638
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:26,625
Under the circumstances,
I don't think Tasha would mind.

639
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,625
She was special to me, sir.

640
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:34,583
We were...

641
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,208
intimate.

642
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,583
Thank you, Commander.

643
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:49,959
I have no further questions
for this witness.

644
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,375
Commander Riker,
do you want to cross?

645
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:56,834
I have no questions, Your Honor.

646
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:57,875
Thank you.

647
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:58,917
You may step down.

648
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,500
I call to the stand
Commander Bruce Maddox

649
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,125
as a hostile witness.

650
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:22,333
COMPUTER:
Verify, Maddox, Bruce,
Commander.

651
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:25,792
Current assignment:
Associate Chair of Robotics

652
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:28,333
Daystrom Technological
Institute.

653
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,834
Major papers...
Yes, yes, yes.

654
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,250
Suffice it to say
he's an expert.

655
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,792
Commander, it is your contention

656
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:35,291
that Lieutenant Commander Data
is not a sentient being

657
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:38,458
and, therefore, not entitled
to all the rights reserved

658
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:41,875
for all life-forms
within this Federation?

659
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,083
Data is not sentient, no.

660
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,875
Commander, would you
enlighten us?

661
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:49,125
What is required
for sentience?

662
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:53,125
Intelligence, self-awareness,
consciousness.

663
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,625
Prove to the court
that I am sentient.

664
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:58,542
This is absurd.

665
00:36:58,542 --> 00:36:59,917
We all know you're sentient.

666
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,417
So I'm sentient,
but Commander Data is not?

667
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:03,375
MADDOX:
That's right.

668
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,208
Uh-huh.
Why?

669
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:07,625
Why am I sentient?

670
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:09,875
Well, you are self-aware.

671
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,959
Ah, that's the second
of your criteria.

672
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:14,750
Let's deal with the first,
intelligence.

673
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,750
Is Commander Data intelligent?

674
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,250
Yes.

675
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,375
It has the ability
to learn and understand

676
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:23,583
and to cope with new situations.

677
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,125
Like this hearing.

678
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,166
Yes.

679
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:28,667
What about self-awareness?

680
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,041
What does that mean?

681
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,959
Why... why am I self-aware?

682
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,959
Because you are conscious
of your existence and actions.

683
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:40,166
You are aware of yourself
and your own ego.

684
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,875
Commander Data,
what are you doing now?

685
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,709
I am taking part
in a legal hearing

686
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:46,709
to determine my rights
and status--

687
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:48,583
am I a person
or property?

688
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:49,750
And what's at stake?

689
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,959
My right to choose.

690
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:54,125
Perhaps my very life.

691
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:56,875
"My rights."

692
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:57,917
"My status."

693
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:00,500
"My right to choose."

694
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,417
(<i> sighing</i> )

695
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:03,917
"My life."

696
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,709
Well, he seems reasonably
self-aware to me, Commander.

697
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm waiting.

698
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:22,333
This is exceedingly difficult.

699
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,458
Do you like Commander Data?

700
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:25,917
I...

701
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,417
I don't know it
well enough

702
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:32,125
to like or dislike it.

703
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,667
But you admire him?

704
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:34,917
Oh, yes.

705
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:37,041
It's an extraordinary piece...

706
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,125
Of engineering and programming.

707
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,583
Yes, you have said that.

708
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,417
Commander, you have
devoted your life

709
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:42,875
to the study of cybernetics
in general?

710
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,041
Yes.

711
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,834
And Commander Data
in particular?

712
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:48,000
Yes.
And now you propose
to dismantle him?

713
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,917
So that I can learn from it
and construct more.

714
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:54,458
How many more?
As many as
are needed.

715
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:58,583
Hundreds, thousands,
if necessary.

716
00:38:58,583 --> 00:38:59,917
There is no limit.

717
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,166
A single Data

718
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,083
and forgive me, Commander

719
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:07,375
is a curiosity.

720
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:09,792
A wonder even.

721
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:13,458
But thousands of Datas--

722
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:17,208
isn't that becoming a race?

723
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,083
And won't we be judged
by how we treat

724
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:22,583
that race?

725
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,750
Now tell me, Commander,
what is Data?

726
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:27,959
I don't understand.

727
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,166
What is he?

728
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,125
A machine.

729
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,959
Is he?
Are you sure?
Yes!

730
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,917
You see, he's met two of your
three criteria for sentience.

731
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,667
So, what if he meets the third,
consciousness,

732
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,875
in even the smallest degree?

733
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,000
What is he then?
I don't know.

734
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,667
Do you?

735
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,500
Do you?

736
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,542
Do you?

737
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:54,417
Well, that's the question
you have to answer.

738
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,417
Your Honor, a courtroom
is a crucible.

739
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:00,291
In it, we burn away
irrelevancies

740
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:01,959
until we are left
with a pure product--

741
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,917
the truth-- for all time.

742
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:06,834
Now, sooner or later, this man,
or others like him

743
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:09,291
will succeed
in replicating Commander Data.

744
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:11,250
Now, the decision
you reach here today

745
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,125
will determine
how we will regard

746
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:17,375
this creation of our genius.

747
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:19,500
It will reveal the kind
of a people we are

748
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,709
what he is destined to be.

749
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,500
It will reach far beyond
this courtroom

750
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,208
and this one android.

751
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:29,542
It could significantly
redefine the boundaries

752
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:31,125
of personal liberty and freedom.

753
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:34,250
Expanding them for some

754
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,041
savagely curtailing them
for others.

755
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:41,041
Are you prepared to condemn him
and all who come after him

756
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:42,792
to servitude and slavery?

757
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:48,208
Your Honor, Starfleet was
founded to seek out new life.

758
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:49,750
Well, there it sits.

759
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:55,625
Waiting.

760
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,959
You wanted a chance to make law.

761
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:03,959
Well, here it is.

762
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:05,417
Make it a good one.

763
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,291
It sits there looking at me

764
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,208
and I don't know
what it is.

765
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:26,917
This case has dealt
with metaphysics

766
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:30,250
with questions best left
to saints and philosophers.

767
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:35,333
I'm neither competent
nor qualified to answer those.

768
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:38,875
But I've got
to make a ruling

769
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:41,041
to try to speak to the future.

770
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,959
Is Data a machine? Yes.

771
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,083
Is he the property
of Starfleet?

772
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,417
No.

773
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:55,667
We have all been
dancing around

774
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,208
the basic issue--

775
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:01,375
does Data have a soul?

776
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:03,417
I don't know
that he has.

777
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:05,125
I don't know that I have.

778
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,959
But I have got
to give him the freedom

779
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,000
to explore
that question himself.

780
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,917
It is the ruling
of this court

781
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:16,875
that Lieutenant Commander Data

782
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,959
has the freedom
to choose.

783
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:37,000
I formally refuse
to undergo your procedure.

784
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,625
I will cancel
that transfer order.

785
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,208
Thank you.

786
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,875
And, Commander,
continue your work.

787
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:50,709
When you are ready,
I will still be here.

788
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:54,709
I find some
of what you propose...

789
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:56,250
intriguing.

790
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,625
He's remarkable.

791
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:06,792
You didn't call him "it."

792
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:21,000
You see, sometimes
it does work.

793
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,291
Phillipa.

794
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:30,959
Dinner?

795
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,166
You buying?

796
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,041
Sir, there is a celebration
on the holodeck.

797
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,500
I have no right
to be there.

798
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,667
Because you failed in your task?

799
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,083
No, God, no.

800
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,083
I came that close
to winning, Data.

801
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,792
Yes, sir.

802
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:03,667
I almost cost you your life.

803
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:06,250
Is it not true...

804
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,792
that had you
refused to prosecute

805
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:11,583
Captain Louvois would
have ruled summarily against me?

806
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,291
Yes.

807
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:17,417
That action injured you
and saved me.

808
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,375
I will not forget it.

809
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:26,125
You're a wise man, my friend.

810
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,959
Not yet, sir

811
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:30,959
but, with your help,
I am learning.
