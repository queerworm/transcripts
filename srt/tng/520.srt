1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,542
Forward tubes armed
and ready, Captain.

2
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:04,667
Fire.

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,583
A direct hit, sir.

4
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,083
The asteroid has
been shattered.

5
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,709
However, the core
is still intact

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,750
and still on
a collision course
with Tessen III.

7
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:19,083
Is it big enough
to cause a threat?

8
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,917
Yes, sir, it is of
sufficient size

9
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,542
and density to cause
planet-wide damage.

10
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:23,917
Time to impact?

11
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:26,166
It will reach the upper
atmosphere in 44 seconds

12
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,583
and impact on the planet
11 seconds later.

13
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:29,959
Ready torpedoes.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,542
Aye, sir.

15
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,250
Sir, the core is composed
of nitrium and chrondite.

16
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:38,041
It is unlikely
another photon torpedo
will be of any effect.

17
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,959
Mr. Worf,
prepare a tractor beam.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,250
Aye, sir.

19
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,750
30 seconds to impact.

20
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:46,125
Captain, I am unable
to get a positive lock

21
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,291
with the tractor beam.

22
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,041
There is magnetic field
interference

23
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,458
emanating from
the core materials.

24
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,208
Activate a deflector dish.

25
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,625
If we project a particle beam,
we may be able to produce

26
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:57,750
a disruptive nuclear effect
within the core.

27
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:58,875
Aye, sir.

28
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:01,083
DATA:
Impact in 17 seconds.

29
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,041
Particle beam activated.

30
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,083
The target has been
destroyed, Captain.

31
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:13,917
The remaining debris
is of no threat
to the planet, sir.

32
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,834
Well done, everyone.

33
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,542
Ensign, put us back on course
for the Moselina system.

34
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,792
Warp four as soon
as we're clear of
the debris field.

35
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:22,458
Aye, sir.

36
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:04,834
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

37
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:09,125
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

38
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

39
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,250
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

40
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:18,792
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

41
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:23,917
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

42
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,792
My instructions were clear.

43
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,250
They were not!

44
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,375
Before he was allowed
to play, he was to place

45
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,208
his soiled clothing
in the garment reprocessor.

46
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,750
I was not!

47
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,959
I sense a touch of
hostility here, gentlemen.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,750
You were specifically
told that.

49
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:41,208
You told me that
yesterday, not today.

50
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,458
If I may suggest...

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,458
You know very well
the same rule

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
applies today that...

53
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:46,875
Please.

54
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:52,750
Why not simply draw up
a contract which clearly

55
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:55,417
defines the duties
of each family member?

56
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,959
You mean he tells me
what he wants and I
have to do it.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,917
No. I mean you both agree
to your responsibilities.

58
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,709
And when you've done the things
that you've agreed to do,

59
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,250
then you've earned
the privilege

60
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,834
to do the things
that you want to do.

61
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,083
When he's cleaned his room,
for instance,

62
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,041
then perhaps he's earned
a visit to the holodeck

63
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,792
to fight his
alien monsters.

64
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:16,917
You suggest bribery.

65
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,125
I suggest working out
an equitable system

66
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,041
with the rules
clearly spelled out...

67
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,875
for the child
and the parent.

68
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,875
You must make a list of
your responsibilities, too.

69
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:34,417
What would you like your
father to promise, Alexander?

70
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,500
No yelling.

71
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,500
I do n--!
I do not yell.

72
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:41,625
Well, then, you should have
no trouble with that part.

73
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:45,667
Why not go back to your quarters
and talk this thing over?

74
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:49,875
Decide on which points each
of you wants in the contract.

75
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,125
Very well.

76
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,875
One day you're
going to be glad

77
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:08,834
your father cared enough
about you to insist on rules.

78
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,208
It may be hard to
imagine right now,

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,583
but eventually
most children

80
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,500
come to appreciate
their parents.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,834
Riker to Counselor Troi.

82
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,000
Your mother's
just come aboard.

83
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,625
On the other hand...

84
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,333
LWAXANA:
Deanna, my dear,
it's mother!

85
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,959
Oh, I've got such
deliciously exciting news.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're going to be
absolutely thrilled.

87
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,250
I'm getting married.

88
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,750
You know, with just
a bit of redecorating

89
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:51,500
here and there,
this Ten-Forward room

90
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:54,208
should make a very
nice wedding hall.

91
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,667
I beg your pardon?

92
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,625
Ah, where else,
my little one...

93
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,333
but here amongst
all my good friends

94
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,875
and in the presence
of my adored daughter?

95
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,709
Mother, where did you...?

96
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,375
<i>When</i> did you meet
this man?

97
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:11,667
Who is he?

98
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,792
I mean,<i> marriage?</i>

99
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:15,583
When did all this happen?

100
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,834
Oh, my poor,
plodding little Deanna

101
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,291
with her questions,
questions, questions.

102
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,583
Wherever did you inherit
such pedestrian genes?

103
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,458
What matters, my little one,
is that your mother's happy.

104
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,083
Mother, if you're happy,
then I'm happy for you.

105
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,542
I only asked who he is
and where you met him.

106
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,709
Those are not
unusual questions.

107
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,250
He's such a wonderful
man, and he has such
good breeding.

108
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,792
Oh, I tell you,
he's absolute perfection.

109
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,417
Who is he?

110
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,583
He's Campio, third minister
to the conference of judges

111
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,041
from the planet Kostolain.

112
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,917
Royalty, my little one...

113
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,458
BOTH:
Naturally.

114
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,083
I didn't even know you'd
ever been to Kostolain.

115
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,834
Or was he on
some diplomatic mission
to Betazed?

116
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,792
Well, uh... um...
neither, actually.

117
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:09,542
Uh, you see, we haven't
exactly met yet, really.

118
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,917
Oh, but the profiles
we've exchanged...

119
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,125
why, they were in such
accord that you could
weep, my little one.

120
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,291
You would weep at
the harmony between us.

121
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,667
Mother, don't you think
it would be a good idea

122
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:24,083
if you actually met the man
you're going to marry

123
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,709
before committing to
spend the rest of
your life with him?

124
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,583
Deanna, I love you but
you do make everything
sound like an epitaph.

125
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,792
ALEXANDER:
I don't want to agree.

126
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,291
But you have to
agree. That is what
an agreement is.

127
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,250
Counselor Troi,
excuse the intrusion,
but we're having

128
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,458
some difficulty
drawing up our contract.

129
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,250
Hmm?

130
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,333
Mrs. Troi.

131
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,291
Hmm.

132
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,834
He's not fair.

133
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,333
The boy is unreasonable.

134
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,375
Well, of course
he's unreasonable.

135
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,875
He's a child.

136
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:56,291
Aw... and such
a child.

137
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,875
You know, making
little boys reasonable
only gives them pimples.

138
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:03,375
Alexander,
this is my mother.

139
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,041
Alexander?!

140
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,792
What a wonderful name.

141
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:12,375
You know, I once knew
a tall, handsome warrior
named Alexander.

142
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:18,041
Oh, he utterly adored me
and we went everywhere--
simply everywhere.

143
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,250
Have you been
anywhere yet...?

144
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,583
Contract?!
What contract?!

145
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,792
Between father and son.

146
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:28,875
A fair and balanced way
to achieve a mutual
sense of order.

147
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,834
Well, how ghastly
for you.

148
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,125
And you are doing this to
your own child, Mr. Woof?

149
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,250
Mother!

150
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,417
It is Worf, madam.

151
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,667
Contracts are usually
between people

152
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,792
who don't really trust
one another.

153
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:45,250
A child who is trusted
becomes worthy
of that trust.

154
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,375
Mother, will you kindly
stay out of this?

155
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,375
And if he does not perform
his contractual duties,

156
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:52,542
I assume he
will be chastised.

157
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,625
He will be...
sanctioned, yes.

158
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:59,250
Mm-hmm, and if you fail
to perform your duties,

159
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,667
what is the child
supposed to do about it?

160
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,792
Mother,
will you please...?

161
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,750
I, not perform my duty?

162
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,667
Alexander, now
life's true gift

163
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,625
is the capacity
to enjoy enjoyment.

164
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:11,959
Now...

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,500
Hmm! Have I
arrived too late?

166
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:19,500
Or, uh... can you
still smile?

167
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:22,083
(<i> laughs</i> )

168
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

169
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,834
Married?
She's getting married?

170
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,834
Yes. If we stay on
our present course,

171
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,583
we should rendezvous with
her intended in 31 hours.

172
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,959
I will not have
that woman continuing

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,333
to use this ship
for her convenience

174
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,458
simply because
her daughter

175
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,291
happens to be
one of my officers.

176
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,417
Apparently, Deanna
being on board is only
part of the reason.

177
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,542
The other reason being?

178
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:49,166
She thinks the honor
of giving away the bride
should fall on you.

179
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,000
Permission for
an onboard wedding
is granted, Number One.

180
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,959
Nothing would please
me more than to give
away Mrs. Troi.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,458
(<i> chuckles</i> )

182
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,375
Ah, my little warrior!

183
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,709
And how are you
this morning?

184
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,834
Oh, I see.

185
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,041
Being punished
for something, are we?

186
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,875
It's just my regular time
to meet with Counselor Troi.

187
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,834
She's not here yet.

188
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,083
Then you're early.

189
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,834
That's very responsible
of you.

190
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:45,458
No, I just wanted
to be out of my room
be-- before...

191
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,166
Before what?

192
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,667
Now, if we're to
be real friends,

193
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,166
we've got to share
only the truth.

194
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,959
Why?

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,417
Well, for one thing,
it's easier.

196
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:04,333
When you tell the truth,
you never have to remember
later what you lied about.

197
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,208
But mostly, a true
friend is a person

198
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,709
you can always tell
the truth to without
worrying about it.

199
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:19,250
I... I wanted to leave

200
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,750
before my father
got back.

201
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:25,250
Oh.

202
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,583
I hate him.

203
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,500
I wish my mother
were here...

204
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,125
but she died.

205
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,583
That's not very
fair, is it?

206
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,500
All he cares about
are rules.

207
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:52,959
I'm supposed to
do everything right
all the time.

208
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,166
I don't know how.

209
00:11:56,208 --> 00:12:02,709
Oh, to tell you the
truth, little warrior,
neither do I.

210
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:10,417
But... I do know
one marvelous thing
we can do with rules.

211
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,834
I'm supposed to wait
for Counselor Troi.

212
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,041
Exactly.

213
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:19,458
I'll bet you've never
been to a colony of
free spirits.

214
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
What do they do there?

215
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh! Whatever they want.

216
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,291
Artists, philosophers,
freethinkers,

217
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:28,417
and people who
don't quite fit
other people's rules.

218
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,125
Personally, I come
for the mud baths.

219
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,250
You-- oh, you're going
to adore the mud baths.

220
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,417
Um...

221
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,625
(<i> beeping</i> )

222
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,375
Ah, computer.

223
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:42,458
I'm assuming that you
have the Parallax Colony
on Shiralea VI?

224
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,625
That program
is available.

225
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,458
Oh, good.

226
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,834
Then, uh,
run it for us, dear.

227
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,166
(<i> gasps and laughs</i> )

228
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,250
(<i> laughs</i> )

229
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,125
What's that?

230
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,625
A wind dancer.
He stands guard.

231
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,917
You see, only those
whose hearts are
joyous may enter.

232
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,625
Aw...

233
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,750
Oh, come on.

234
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:32,125
Oh!

235
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,375
Fire sculptor.
We'll chat with her later

236
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:49,458
if you're not wearing
anything flammable.

237
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,583
Hello.
A few of us are just

238
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,625
gathering together
for our laughing hour.

239
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,458
Would you care to
come laugh with us?

240
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,125
Actually, we were about
to experience a mud bath.

241
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,291
Were you?
What an idea. Bink!

242
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,375
My friends and I
will join you.

243
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:07,083
One can always...
laugh in the bath.

244
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,250
(<i> laughing</i> )

245
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,083
Do you ever drop one?

246
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,709
Oh, no.
No, no,

247
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,959
these are my worlds.
I protect them.

248
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,959
I am a master of worlds,
and they fly only as I wish.

249
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,625
(<i> Lwaxana laughing</i> )

250
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:22,792
Ooh.

251
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:23,792
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

252
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:26,083
Ooh!

253
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,542
We are having guests
for laughing hour.

254
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,834
Would you care
to join us?

255
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,000
We'd love to.

256
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:31,875
No, thank you.

257
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,959
Yes.
No.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,291
Why do you always say no
when I say yes?

259
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,083
I don't.
You just did.

260
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,250
There you go again.

261
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,709
You're the most
negative person.

262
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,125
Why are they arguing?

263
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,291
They're friends.

264
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,917
They love
contradiction.

265
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,125
They thrive on challenge.

266
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,291
They flourish
in conflict.

267
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,458
Then why
are they friends?

268
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,291
Oh, well, who else
you going to fight with
if not your friends?

269
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,375
Hold!

270
00:14:56,417 --> 00:15:00,166
What is the lesson
for today?

271
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,750
Oh, damned if we know.

272
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:04,000
We're just here for
some fun in a mud bath.

273
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:08,500
Every moment
requires a purpose.

274
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,000
No, it doesn't.

275
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:15,500
Every purpose
requires a plan.

276
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,500
He does this every day,

277
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,000
usually while everyone's
food is getting cold.

278
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,000
(<i> yawning</i> )

279
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,625
It's rather boring.

280
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:28,083
The higher...

281
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:33,333
the fewer.

282
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,458
Well, that's a conversation
stopper if I ever heard one.

283
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,834
WOMAN:
And you're being stubborn.

284
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,375
MAN:
I am not. You are.

285
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:41,041
I am not.
Yes, you are.

286
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,000
I am not.

287
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,500
Excuse me.

288
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,917
If you're gonna argue,
you should remember...

289
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:52,041
(<i> in deep voice</i> ):
the higher...
the fewer.

290
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,834
So...
my little warrior

291
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:05,750
wants to see more
out of life than
just fighting, eh?

292
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:12,041
Oh, the mind opens,
and in creeps wisdom.

293
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,834
Alexander.

294
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:21,250
(<i> muttering</i> )

295
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

296
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,959
Come.

297
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,458
Isn't Alexander
supposed to be with you?

298
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,667
He didn't show up
for his appointment.

299
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,375
I assumed he must
still be here.

300
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:43,417
Computer, what is
the location of
Alexander Rozhenko?

301
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,625
Alexander Rozhenko
is on Holodeck Two.

302
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,166
Is he there alone?

303
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,917
He is with Lwaxana Troi.

304
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,917
To all the creatures
within us.

305
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,959
(<i> laughing</i> )

306
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,917
To all the creatures
within us?

307
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,667
Well, of course.

308
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,291
Every one of us has
a thousand different kinds

309
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,834
of little people
inside of us.

310
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,917
And some of them want
to get out and be wild

311
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,417
and some want to be sad
or happy or inventive
or even just go dancing.

312
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:21,625
That's why we all have
so many different urges
at different times.

313
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:25,333
And all those different
little people inside of us?

314
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,125
We must never be
afraid to take them
with us wherever we go.

315
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,709
I mean, who knows when
we may need one of them

316
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,917
to pop up and rescue us
from ourselves?

317
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:39,041
Ah, variety,
my little Alex.

318
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:45,208
The great secret is
not the variety of life,
it's the variety of<i> us.</i>

319
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,542
Are we ready
for the entertainment?

320
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,458
Yes. Bring on
the entertainment.

321
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,250
Ah!

LWAXANA:
Little one.

Mr. Woof, come.
Join us.

327
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,458
Mother, I'm trying
to help the boy

328
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,709
learn the value
of responsibility.

329
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,875
You're not helping
by giving him a lot
of mixed messages.

330
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:07,083
I exposed you to all sorts
of mixed messages when
you were that age.

331
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,834
You still turned
out deadly dull.

332
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,917
What are you
so worried about?

333
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,750
Among other things, his
relationship with his father.

334
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,083
Oh!

335
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,291
No more holodeck, Mother.

336
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh...
Please.

337
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,500
Anyway, why aren't
you all absorbed in
your wedding plans?

338
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:21,959
It's only three days away.

339
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,917
I'm letting Mr. Homn

340
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,583
handle all the
mundane details.

341
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,291
He knows my tastes.

342
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,709
Mother...

343
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,000
Deanna, there is
absolutely

344
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,333
nothing to do,
you nosy little girl.

345
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,000
Campio's already sent me
his mother's wedding gown,

346
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,750
which Mr. Homn is
now altering for me.

347
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,834
Outside of that, there
really isn't anything else...

348
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,291
Wedding gown?
Mother, stop.

349
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,625
You're telling me you're
not going to be naked
at your own wedding?

350
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:50,333
Campio is from
a different planet
with different traditions.

351
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,125
He would not approve
of a traditional
Betazoid wedding,

352
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,083
so I am happily adapting.

353
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,166
Now, it's as simple as that,
and I need some tea.

354
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,834
I can't believe
I'm hearing this

355
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:07,125
from the heir to the
Holy Rings of Betazed,

356
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,792
holder of the Sacred
Chalice of Rixx.

357
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:14,750
Oh! Oh, why can't I ever
work this replicator?

358
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:20,917
Mother, I think it's
time to talk about
this mysterious marriage

359
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,583
to a man you've never met.

360
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,834
Computer,
some Jestral tea, please.

361
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:31,125
Oh, anyway, why
shouldn't I get married
if I choose to?

362
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,792
You make everything
into such a mystery.

363
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,834
There is no mystery,
Deanna,

364
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,500
except about
this Petrokian sausage.

365
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:42,000
The tea-- all I wanted
was a cup of tea.

366
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:47,166
Oh, dear, I think
your replicator's having
a nervous collapse.

367
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,875
Oh...

368
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:58,208
A level-4 diagnostic
of the food
replication systems

369
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,000
have failed to detect
any faults in the
orientation terminals.

370
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,625
That may be,
but we've still got

371
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:05,959
over 200 reports
of malfunctioning
replicators.

372
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,250
(<i> beeping</i> )

373
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,458
There's an energy
fluctuation in one of the
utility access corridors.

374
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,417
Well, we better look
into it, whatever it is,

375
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,583
before the captain
decides to order dinner.

376
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,959
Yeah, Dash 6-4.
Here we are.

377
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:34,709
Huh. Some kind of
intermittent EM
field pattern.

378
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,375
Give me a hand with
that, will you, Data?

379
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:49,583
Well, there's no
plasma leakage.

380
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,083
Just a little
negative ion charging.

381
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,959
Oh, bad enough, having
to wear anything at all

382
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,083
to my own wedding,
but this?!

383
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

384
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,834
Yeah, perhaps, uh,
if we lower the bodice.

385
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,166
Oh.

386
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,166
Uh...

387
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,667
raise the hemline, then.

388
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:30,250
What a constant joy
you are.

389
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,333
(<i> door chimes</i> )

390
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,709
Oh-- oh, Mr. Homn...

391
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:42,709
LWAXANA:
Alexander!

392
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,291
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Oh, my little warrior.

393
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,041
Come here.
Come on.

394
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:50,333
Come... oh, give me
a great big hug.

395
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,208
(<i> sighs</i> )

396
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,375
Now, you're not
escaping another
appointment, are you?

397
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,417
No, ma'am.

398
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:03,709
Oh, I suppose eventually
we all have to live up
to our obligations.

399
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,750
Ah... well, now,
tell me.

400
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,875
What brings you here
to brighten my day?

401
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:13,291
I wanted to say I'm
sorry if I got you
in any trouble.

402
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:17,208
Oh! Oh, that's
very sweet, dear,

403
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,542
but I really wasn't
in any trouble...

404
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:24,375
until I saw this dress.

405
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:26,250
Oh!

406
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,625
Ugly, isn't it?

407
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,208
What's it for?

408
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,333
I'm getting married.

409
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,667
Why?

410
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:35,333
You sure my daughter
didn't send you?

411
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:38,250
Oh, just a joke.

412
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,375
People get married
because, uh...

413
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:45,542
because they want to spend
their lives with someone.

414
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,625
Their whole life?

415
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,208
Uh-huh.

416
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,875
They must have to like
that person a lot.

417
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:53,500
Well, if you're
young and lucky,

418
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:57,709
it will be someone
you like a lot, yes.

419
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,917
(<i> sighs</i> )

420
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,166
And, uh...
and if you're older...

421
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,083
Are you very old?

422
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,458
Uh...

423
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,792
Um...

424
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:15,792
I'm alone, Alex.

425
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:20,125
And when you do get older

426
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,000
and can no longer
pick and choose

427
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:26,458
from whatever
may come your way...

428
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:34,041
then you, uh, then you do
what we call a compromise.

429
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:37,083
It keeps you
from being afraid.

430
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:50,667
We have traced the failure
to a data net interface

431
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:54,417
which routes replicator
selections to the
correct subprocessors.

432
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,709
When we opened the panel,
we discovered that
the interface

433
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,834
had been transformed
into a gelatinous material

434
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,792
that we haven't
been able to identify.

435
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:04,709
(<i> alarm buzzes</i> )

436
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:09,000
We have an
intermittent failure

437
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,583
of the inertial
damping system.

438
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,208
Take us out
of warp, Ensign.

439
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,917
Primary attitude control
has failed.

440
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,458
We're going
to secondary systems.

441
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,625
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

442
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,500
We have lost
helm control, sir.

443
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,500
Try a manual bypass
of the damping systems.

444
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:30,458
Aye, sir.

445
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,917
Backup generators?

446
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,458
Coming on-line now.

447
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,291
How long before we
regain attitude control?

448
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,458
We're almost there.

449
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,625
Ensign, put us back
on course, but stay
at impulse for now.

450
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,333
Did something hit us,
Mr. Worf?

451
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:52,041
Negative, sir.

452
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,500
The inertial dampers
shouldn't fail

453
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:54,917
without kicking in
the automatic bypass.

454
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,166
I want to know
what went wrong.

455
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,458
Analysis in 30 minutes.

456
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:07,583
The same thing that
happened to the replicator
happened to the stabilizer.

457
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:10,750
The transfers
in both systems
were turned into this.

458
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:12,333
Some sort of corrosion?

459
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:15,125
We have not yet identified
the substance, Commander.

460
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,667
Whatever it is,
it looks like there's been

461
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,458
a conversion process,
transforming

462
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,959
some of the metal
into gelatinous residue.

463
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,625
But what caused
it is a mystery.

464
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:24,375
The replicators
and the stabilizers--

465
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,875
two totally
unrelated systems.

466
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,208
Yes, sir, and we
still don't know why

467
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,542
the sensors didn't
pick up the problems.

468
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,625
Let's run a mass
spectrometer analysis

469
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,291
and find out what
this stuff is.

470
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,625
MAN:
Transporter Room One
to Captain Picard.

471
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:39,125
Minister Campio
is beaming on board, sir.

472
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,417
I'll be right there.

473
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:43,166
The bridegroom.

474
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:54,500
Ah, Campio!
My dear!

475
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:57,709
Your compatibility profile
doesn't do you justice.

476
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,125
I, of course, am
Lwaxana, and any
introductory compliments

477
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,500
you'd care to make
will be happily received.

478
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:05,083
Indeed, Mrs. Troi.

479
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,458
You are even lovelier
in person.

480
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Oh, now that worked
just fine.

481
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:17,750
Now, now, we don't wish
to be too familiar
at this early juncture.

482
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:19,959
Oh.

483
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,333
Forgive this tardiness.
Ship's business.

484
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,500
Minister Campio,
Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

485
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:27,875
Welcome aboard.

486
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,834
I thank you and greet
you with appreciation

487
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:34,291
for permitting this wedding
aboard your fine vessel.

488
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:35,542
Not at all, sir.

489
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,250
Campio, may I
present my daughter?

490
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,375
Deanna Troi, meet...
um, well,

491
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,583
your future stepfather,
come to think of it.

492
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:47,166
Oh, yes, if I recall
the profile, you are
the ship's counselor?

493
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,500
I am, sir.

494
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,375
And my escort, who
need not be addressed

495
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:54,250
in this company,
Protocol Master Erko.

496
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:57,709
Uh, Campio, personally,
I absolutely adore

497
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,750
all the ostentation
I can get, but, uh, hmm...
protocol master?

498
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:04,667
I would not do you
nor our benevolent hosts

499
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:07,041
the disservice of
failing to ensure

500
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,500
that priorities
are observed.

501
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:12,875
Oh, yes, yes.
How very thoughtful.

502
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:15,000
After all, it would
be unpardonable

503
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:19,166
simply to abandon
ourselves to the moment,
would it not?

504
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,458
Oh, unpardonable.

505
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,166
Well, it looks like
the only alloy

506
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:36,375
common to both the
replicator and the
stabilizer is nitrium.

507
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:39,667
Computer, analyze
the nitrium content

508
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:42,166
of both the affected
stabilizer and replicator.

509
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,542
There is no nitrium
present

510
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:46,250
in the affected stabilizer
or replicator.

511
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,250
(<i> sighs</i> )

512
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:59,125
There is none present
in the residue, either.

513
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,834
According to
the mass spectrometer,

514
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:02,375
the elements in the residue
have been broken down

515
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:04,583
into simpler
molecular structures.

516
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:06,041
That would suggest
the nitrium

517
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:08,125
has been organically
metabolized.

518
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,625
Maybe that's it, Data.

519
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:13,667
If a living organism
ingested the nitrium...

520
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:16,959
This residue would be
the waste left behind.

521
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,917
Well, if that's true--
if something's eating away

522
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,250
at the nitrium on the
ship, then that means

523
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,750
that the dilithium
chamber is vulnerable

524
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:26,709
as well as the power
transfer conduits.

525
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,583
We'd better get
to engineering.

526
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,709
ALEXANDER:
Ha!

527
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,917
Ha!

528
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,792
WORF:
Eat, son.

529
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:38,208
Ha!

530
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,583
What are you doing?
What is that noise?

531
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:43,083
Ha!
It's my laughing hour.

532
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,709
Ha!

533
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,959
Ha! Ha!

534
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,959
That is enough, please.

535
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,875
It is your dinner hour.

536
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:54,750
Eat.
Ha!

537
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:59,375
I promised to meet
Mrs. Troi for another
lesson in happy wisdom. Ha!

538
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:02,000
Will you stop doing that,
please?

539
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,000
Ha!

540
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:05,041
Alexander,
eat your food.

541
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:07,041
Wisdom will wait,
I assure you.

542
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:10,333
I promised. Should I
break my promise, Father?

543
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,875
A Klingon never
breaks his word.

544
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:15,375
Where are you going?

545
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:17,875
You said no Klingon
ever breaks his word.

546
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:22,875
I did not mean<i> now.</i> 
Now just sit down and eat.

547
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:25,959
I don't understand, Father.
You're confusing me.

548
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,625
Understand later.
Just eat.

549
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,333
Father...

550
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,166
The higher, the fewer.

551
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,667
I don't wish to be
authoritative, my dear,

552
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:51,542
but Master Erko says that
now is our proper time

553
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,375
for discussion of
certain details.

554
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:56,583
Oh, well,
I certainly don't want

555
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,458
to be considered
anti-Erko, dear,

556
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,041
but I did promise Alexander
one more holodeck trip.

557
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,583
Come along,
my little love.

558
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:06,625
Surely there'll be
other occasions

559
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,959
for you to spend
time with the boy.

560
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,583
Oh, my goodness, Campio.

561
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:15,792
You and I are going to have
the rest of our lives.

562
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,750
I'll tell you what.
I'll be back here

563
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,375
with you in one hour
exactly, all right?

564
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:24,750
Minister, the woman
should not be addressing
you in the familiar.

565
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,583
(<i> gasps</i> )

566
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,000
Mother, we have to talk.

567
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,375
Yes, we certainly do,
dear, but not just now.

568
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:35,458
Well, how, um,
how do I address him?

569
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,625
Mother, we've come
for Alexander.

570
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,792
Please forgive
the intrusion.

571
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:42,041
Preferably, he should
be called by his
ministerial title.

572
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,375
(<i> laughs</i> )

573
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,667
I'll remember.

574
00:31:45,709 --> 00:31:47,667
Oh, um, Mr. Homn,

575
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,875
uh, you make sure
that everyone is--

576
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:52,166
is comfortable
until we get back.

577
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:55,208
And especially the, um,
uh, the minister here.

578
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,834
Now I'll be back--
one hour, darling.
I'll see you then.

579
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,041
WORF:
Mrs. Troi?
Hmm?

580
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,959
It is Alexander's
dinner hour.

581
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,125
Oh! Oh, how
thoughtless of me.

582
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:07,542
I guess we'll just have
to have a little picnic
before our mud bath.

583
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:11,375
We have, uh, business
to deal with here.

584
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:14,834
Leaving is simply
not acceptable.

585
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,125
Oh, well, can't we
just pretend that
it's acceptable?

586
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,875
We'll be back.
You are missing
the point.

587
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:23,667
Alexander, you will
return to our quarters
and have dinner.

588
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,667
But we were going
to go to the holodeck.

589
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:29,083
Mother, you're undermining
every effort we're
trying to make here.

590
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,875
Oh, don't be absurd.
You poor dear!

591
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:33,583
Don't they ever
let you change those
colorless outfits?

592
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:35,375
It is essential
that we begin

593
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:37,709
a discussion of the
wedding procedures now.

594
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,500
Oh, Minister, darling,
perhaps you and the jerko here

595
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,959
can come with us.
Ah...

596
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Lwaxana, this exceeds
all boundaries.

597
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:49,375
Oh, well, a half hour, then.
No longer, I promise.

598
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:51,500
Oh, uh, Mr. Homn?
Your duties.

599
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:54,125
Counselor Troi,
have you no influence?

600
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,834
Ha!
Ha!

601
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:58,417
Lwaxana,
if you will remain,

602
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:01,166
I may allow the boy
to stay while...

603
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:02,333
Definitely not!

604
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,709
WORF:
Definitely not.

605
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,625
My son is to
return to quarters.

606
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,458
Nor may a servant
be present

607
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,542
during a prenuptial
consultation.

608
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,875
Well, sir, I'm afraid

609
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:14,583
even the<i> bride</i> won't be
present for this one.

610
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,583
The dilithium chamber
shows no anomalous readings.

611
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:29,417
So far, these transfer
conduits are clean, too.

612
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,792
Hold on.

613
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:33,125
I'm getting
something here.

614
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:36,250
There's a severe
energy fluctuation
in this access panel.

615
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:14,000
What happened?

616
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,709
Well, I was
just juggling,

617
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,792
and I happened to...
catch one in my mouth.

618
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:22,125
It tasted good,
so I ate it.

619
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:26,500
Before I knew it
I'd eaten up every
one of my worlds.

620
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,667
It never occurred to me
that once they were gone,

621
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:32,583
I'd have nothing
left to juggle.

622
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:36,375
If you ever have
a world, plan ahead.

623
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,166
Don't eat it.

624
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,959
(<i> chuckles</i> )

625
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,667
Well, now!
Almost time to get back.

626
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,542
Are you sad?

627
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,792
Of course not.
I'm about to be a bride.

628
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:51,625
You know that man
you're going to marry?
Mm-hmm.

629
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,500
He would never come and
take a mud bath, would he?

630
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:56,458
Oh, he might.

631
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,250
Probably not.

632
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:03,375
You know, maybe this
would be a good time

633
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,834
to get one of
those little people

634
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:09,542
that live inside of
you to-- to come out

635
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:12,458
and tell you what
to do or help you
or something.

636
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,750
Alexander, what are
you talking about?

637
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:16,125
I'm sorry.

638
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,792
No.

639
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:21,417
No.

640
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:24,750
Don't you dare
be sorry.

641
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,583
(<i> sighs</i> )

642
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:40,041
Wh-- what's wrong?

643
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,375
Uh, come along,
Alexander.

644
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:45,625
Let's not leave everyone
waiting for us.

645
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:48,291
Once we saw that
photonic trail moving
through the wall,

646
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,792
we realized we must
be dealing with

647
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:51,667
a metal parasite
of some kind.

648
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:54,041
We believe the
parasites came through
the ship's hull

649
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,417
after we destroyed
the asteroid near
Tessen III.

650
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,792
Are they attacking
anything other than
nitrium alloy?

651
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,625
No, sir, not
that we can tell.

652
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,208
But we've got
nitrium everywhere--

653
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,208
the computers,
the life support,

654
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,250
the ventilation,
the engines,

655
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,166
even the
dilithium chamber.

656
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,333
Mr. Data, the asteroid
we destroyed-- that
was rich in nitrium.

657
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,875
Aye, sir.

658
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:16,834
And that asteroid came
from the Pelloris field.

659
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,125
If the rest of that field
is rich in nitrium,

660
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,250
it would make a
natural feeding ground.

661
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,125
We should think about
going back there.

662
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:24,959
The parasites could
possibly be lured back
to the asteroids

663
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,750
for a meal that's more
appealing than we are.

664
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:28,250
Mr. Data, how long
to the field?

665
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:30,750
At warp nine, five hours,
20 minutes, sir.

666
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,625
Picard to bridge.
Riker here, sir.

667
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:35,417
Set a course for the
Pelloris asteroid field,
warp nine.

668
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:36,875
Aye, sir.

669
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:39,834
Captain, with
our sensors unable

670
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:42,166
to detect the parasites,
and given the speed

671
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,125
with which they appear to be
moving through the ship...

672
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,625
We may not have
five hours, 20 minutes.

673
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,792
I'm aware of that.
How can we slow them down?

674
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:50,625
In several cases,
an exanogen gas barrier

675
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,542
has been known to
slow the progress
of metal parasites.

676
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,500
They don't like cold, eh?

677
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:56,792
Make it so.

678
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:58,792
LA FORGE:
The problem
is finding them.

679
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:00,959
As soon as we spot
an energy fluctuation,

680
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,959
they've already
consumed all the nitrium
and would have moved on.

681
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,417
Primary power systems
are going down.

682
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,125
I've rerouted to the
secondary generators.

683
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,875
Inform the bridge.
Mr. Data, with me.

684
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,166
Bridge.

685
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,583
Commander, do you
have any suggestions

686
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,291
as to how we could
encourage the parasites
to leave the ship

687
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,083
once we reach
the Pelloris field?

688
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,458
If we reconfigure
a particle beam

689
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,458
with a high
concentration of nitrium

690
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,750
and project it toward
one of the asteroids...

691
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:38,166
Then they would
follow the beam

692
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:41,500
like a trail
of bread crumbs.

693
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,583
Very well.

694
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:54,208
Turbolift velocity
is beginning to
fluctuate, Captain.

695
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,250
Computer,
halt at next level.

696
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,875
Computer, acknowledge.

697
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,083
We have reached
the bridge, sir.

698
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:20,083
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

699
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,333
Report, Number One.

700
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,875
Ventilation and
life support are failing

701
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,375
at random spots
all over the ship.

702
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,959
Captain, we have
dropped to warp 5.7.

703
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,125
Picard to engineering.
La Forge here.

704
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:31,709
What's happening,
Mr. La Forge?
We're losing speed.

705
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,375
The parasites
must have gotten into

706
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:35,834
the primary warp
controllers, Captain.

707
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,750
I'm trying to do
a bypass patch

708
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:39,458
to isolate the
backup controllers,

709
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,166
but it looks like warp six
is about the best

710
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:42,625
I'm going to be able
to give you.

711
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:44,583
At that speed,
Mr. La Forge,

712
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:49,000
there won't be
a ship left to reach
the Pelloris field.

713
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:51,792
Well, do what you have to.
Working on it, sir.

714
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:55,375
Captain, we are
losing life support
on Decks 11 and 12.

715
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:58,583
Mr. Worf, have security
evacuate all personnel
from those decks.

716
00:38:58,625 --> 00:38:59,709
Aye, sir.

717
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,000
Engineering to bridge.

718
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,792
We've got warp 6.5,
but I don't know

719
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,959
how much more coaxing
we can do here.

720
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,625
We need more speed
than that, Commander.

721
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:14,000
The matter-antimatter
injectors are failing.

722
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,667
I'm rerouting to secondary
injector power now.

723
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:20,166
Watch the antimatter
containment for
any system failure.

724
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:28,083
Atmospheric systems
are down 27%.

725
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:30,709
We're going below
tolerable oxygen limits.

726
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,917
We must evacuate Decks
20 through 24, Captain.

727
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:34,375
Make it so.

728
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:36,834
Shut down life support
to those decks.

729
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,542
Direct all evacuees
to Decks nine and ten.

730
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:41,792
Divert emergency life
support to those decks.

731
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:44,083
Aye, sir.

732
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,917
Time to asteroid field?

733
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,750
If we maintain
our current speed,

734
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:50,750
two hours,
23 minutes, sir.

735
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:54,291
Mr. Data, the rest of us
may lose consciousness.

736
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,041
If we do,
it will be your job

737
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,709
to execute the plan
as discussed.

738
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,583
Aye, sir.

739
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:40,041

is at 34%.

741
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,959
Estimated breach
in one minute.

742
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:53,709
Computer, transfer
power from warp engines
to life support.

743
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,417
Transfer complete.

744
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,125
Activate Bussard
collector.

745
00:40:57,166 --> 00:41:00,834
Activated. Breach of
dilithium chamber
in 40 seconds.

746
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:05,625
Reconfigure
hydrogen-plasma mixture
to include 30% nitrium.

747
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:07,000
Mixture complete.

748
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:12,166
Project emitter beam,

00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,917
Mr. Data.

752
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,625
The plan was
successful, sir.

753
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,834
Well done.

754
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:41,291
Mr. Worf,
coordinate your teams

755
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:45,375
with Dr. Crusher
and Commander La Forge.

756
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:47,750
Assess damage and injury.

757
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:49,709
Aye, sir.

758
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:56,959
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45733.6.</i>

759
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
<i>Temporary repairs to</i>
<i>the ship have been completed.</i>

760
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:01,417
<i>Our attention now turns</i>

761
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:04,917
<i>to matters of</i>
<i>a more festive nature.</i>

762
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:08,375
(<i> murmuring voices</i> )

763
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:31,834
You'd think
she'd at least

764
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:34,291
get to her own
wedding on time.

765
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:38,291
(<i> door opens</i> )

766
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,375
Minister!
Minister!

767
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:24,375
This is infamous!
Infamous!

768
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:26,333
We must leave
immediately.

769
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,667
Ah... heavenly.

770
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:45,250
(<i> chuckles</i> )

771
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:49,333
Every pore in my body
tingles with contentment.

772
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,458
(<i> chuckles</i> )

773
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,625
Isn't it wonderful
how things worked out,
Alexander?

774
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:00,709
I wanted to teach
you how to grab
the joys of living,

775
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,667
and you turned around
and, uh... and taught me
to not let go of them.

776
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,166
How very mutual.

777
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,083
TROI:
We still have to learn
how to live

778
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:11,375
in the real world,
Mother-- all of us.

779
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:17,083
She's absolutely
right, Alexander,
but only when necessary.

780
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:20,041
(<i> growling</i> )

781
00:44:24,917 --> 00:44:28,542
You're just supposed
to<i> sit</i> here?
