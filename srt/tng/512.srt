00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,166
<i>While on a mapping survey,</i>
<i>we are conveying</i>

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:11,041
<i>a delegation of</i>
<i>Ullians to Kaldra IV.</i>

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,583
<i>These telepathic historians</i>

5
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,792
<i>by retrieving</i>
<i>long-forgotten memories.</i>

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a chipped cup, off-white...
with a crack in it.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,834
I can see it, but I don't
remember anything else about it.

8
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:33,041
MAN: When you see it,
do you hear any sounds?

9
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:37,000
No, I don't think so.

10
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,458
Wait.

11
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,375
Yes, uh... humming.

12
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,000
Someone's humming.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,417
A woman.

14
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,083
Yes, but I don't
know who it is.

15
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,709
Try to touch the cup.

16
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:05,792
Ooh, it-- it has a sharp
edge where it's chipped.

17
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,542
Is there anything
inside the cup?

18
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,458
A liquid... dark.

19
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,166
MAN:
Like tea?

20
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,458
It's not hot.

21
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,750
It's bitter.

22
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,542
There's something else
inside the cup.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,625
Yes, a... a wooden handle.

24
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,792
MAN:
A spoon?

25
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,959
No, it's more delicate
than that.

26
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,000
MAN:
Reach out for it.

27
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,625
A brush.

28
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:53,625
An ink brush.

29
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,291
(<i> humming</i> )

30
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,333
I hear that humming again.

31
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:07,000
Keep listening to it,
and hold out the brush.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,667
See if anyone
takes it from you.

33
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,166
(<i> woman humming</i> )

34
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,875
(<i> woman speaking in</i>
<i>foreign language)</i>

35
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,041
It's Obachan...

36
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,875
my grandmother.

37
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,458
She's doing
ink brush writing.

38
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,125
I can remember it now.

39
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,417
She, uh... she used that cup
for cleaning the brushes

40
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,375
and it was my job to
fill the cup with water

41
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,333
and bring it
to the table.

42
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,375
I would sit beside
her and watch

43
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,709
the most beautiful
characters come from that brush

44
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:43,250
and the whole time, she'd be
humming to herself.

45
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,792
I-- I remember it
like it was yesterday.

46
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,417
That is remarkable.

47
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,834
You remembered
such vivid details.

48
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:53,083
For years, I've seen that
old cup in my memory,

49
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,041
but I could never
remember what it was

50
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,792
or why it was important.
Thank you.

51
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:00,291
Well, you're entirely welcome,
young lady.

52
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,709
Perhaps someone else
would care to try?

53
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,125
You, madam?

54
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,834
You're thinking about that
first childhood kiss.

55
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:10,417
Would you like to
remember more about it?

56
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,583
Father, you know you're
not supposed to probe

57
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,875
someone's memory unless
they've given you permission.

58
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,291
You are right.

59
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:21,125
But sometimes,
with a beautiful woman,

60
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,083
I cannot help myself.

61
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,083
(<i> laughing</i> )

62
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,709
How about you, Commander?
Got any memories

63
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,166
you feel like digging up?

64
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,875
None that I'd care to
share with an audience.

65
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,250
It's getting late.
I'd better be going.

66
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,417
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

67
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:21,166
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

68
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,083
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

69
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,917
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

70
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:31,625
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

71
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:35,750
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

72
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,333
It is perplexing to me

73
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,375
that the Ullians' ability
to retrieve memory

74
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,375
is so highly prized.

75
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,333
If an event were important
enough to be recovered,

76
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,000
why would it
have been forgotten?

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,291
Well, it's not quite the same
for us as it is for you, Data.

78
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,709
You record every second of
every moment of your life.

79
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:56,834
That is correct.

80
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,208
And then, if you
want to recall

81
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,625
any one of those moments,

82
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,291
you just access the
proper memory circuit.

83
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,917
My understanding of
the human brain

84
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:06,542
suggests the process
is the same for you.

85
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:09,542
Each memory is encoded
in chains of molecules.

86
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,000
If you want to
retrieve it,

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,583
you simply access the
proper RNA sequence.

88
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,750
Yeah, that's true.

89
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,917
Then in what way
is it different?

90
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,417
Sometimes
there are memories

91
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,542
we just can't...
(<i> snaps</i> )

92
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:23,875
...access at the
spur of the moment.

93
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,250
For instance,
I have no recollection

94
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,125
of how I spent my
last birthday.

95
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,792
Birthdays are
important occasions,

96
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,959
and you would think that I'd
remember how I spent the day,

97
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,959
but right now, I can't even
remember... where I was.

98
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,000
Deck two.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,917
On the other hand,
I remember everything

100
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,291
about the time I got my
first pet-- a Circassian cat.

101
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,667
I was eight.

102
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,917
I remember how
funny-looking he was.

103
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,959
I remember how
excited I was.

104
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,041
It was as if it
happened yesterday.

105
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,959
Perhaps you remember the
pleasant memories

106
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,750
and forget the
unpleasant ones.

107
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,125
No, sometimes the bad memories
can be the most intense of all.

108
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,041
It would seem there is
no predictable pattern

109
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,417
to human memory.

110
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,542
It would seem.

111
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,000
This library of ours has been in
the planning stages for years--

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,959
a collection of the
retrieved memories

113
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,959
of races from many
different star systems--

114
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,917
What my son means to say
is we think of ourselves

115
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:21,291
as archaeologists
of the mind.

116
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,250
We believe that the history
of a world is contained

117
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,375
in the personal
experience of its people.

118
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,792
Rather like the ancient
oral historians on Earth.

119
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:30,250
Exactly.

120
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,500
The library we propose
will be a vast storehouse

121
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,750
of these individual memories.

122
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,750
That sounds like
quite a project.

123
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,291
How long will it take to
finish your studies on Kaldra?

124
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,709
Many months.

125
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,291
We've been working
for years,

126
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,417
and we've surveyed
only 11 planets

127
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,709
in eight star systems.

128
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,625
But it's our
way of life.

129
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,291
We wouldn't want to
do anything else.

130
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,125
Captain, Mr. Tarmin
gave us a demonstration

131
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,792
of his abilities
this afternoon.

132
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,500
It's fascinating.

133
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,083
Perhaps you would like
to resurrect some memories?

134
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,750
TARMIN: I'd be happy to probe
your recollections, Captain.

135
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,250
Most people find it
an enjoyable experience.

136
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,583
I'm sure.

137
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,709
However, I don't think
I would make

138
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,750
a particularly good subject.

139
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,250
I'm sure you'd be ideal,

140
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,000
and you must have
some intriguing memories.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,500
TARMIN: We won't be on
your ship for long.

142
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,291
This may be your last chance.

143
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,417
(<i> chuckling</i> )
Yes, well...

144
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:29,208
Tarmin, we mustn't
influence people.

145
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,875
We must let them
come to us willingly.

146
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,250
I have found over the years

147
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,291
there are many
who want the experience

148
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,792
of memory retrieval,

149
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,333
but who lack some
encouragement

150
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,709
in order
to come forward.

151
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:42,333
You, Mr. Worf.

152
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,667
I would love to explore
Klingon memories.

153
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:51,375
Klingons do not allow
themselves to be probed.

154
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,625
But there is nothing to fear.

155
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,000
Father...

156
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,583
I am not fearful.

157
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,125
Commander La Forge? You?

158
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,917
I don't think so.
Thanks, anyway.

159
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:08,792
(<i> chuckles</i> )
I have rarely encountered

160
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,667
such squeamish people.

161
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:14,000
Dr. Crusher?
Commander Riker?

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,959
Mr. Tarmin, are all Ullians
able to read memories?

163
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,083
Oh, no, my dear.

164
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,166
The technique requires
special training.

165
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,417
It is a serious commitment.

166
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,083
INAD: It takes
years of study.

167
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:30,291
Tarmin is the most
proficient of our group.

168
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,583
Once, Jev spent two days

169
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,959
with a contingent
of elderly Gentons.

170
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,667
He couldn't get anything
from them.

171
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,917
I spent only one hour
with them and retrieved

172
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:42,583
a fragment from the
Gentonian trade wars.

173
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,250
Excuse me.

174
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,083
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

175
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,417
Exactly how long
will it be

176
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,625
before we get to Kaldra,
Captain?

177
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,959
PICARD:
Mr. Data?

DATA:
Four days, 11 hours.

179
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,709
Jev?

180
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:05,583
I'm sorry, I--
I'm being rude.

181
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,125
No, not at all.

182
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,208
My father finds it amusing
to demean me in public.

183
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,458
I reach the point where I
don't wanna hear any more.

184
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,250
It's not easy having
an overbearing parent.

185
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,417
Believe me,
I know how you feel.

186
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,333
Oh, that's right--
you're an empath.

187
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,542
Oh, I can't read Ullians.

188
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:25,458
But I do know a
certain Betazoid mother

189
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,291
who is a great deal
like your father.

190
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,041
Deck eight.

191
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,875
Deck 16.

192
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,041
I've learned to remind myself
that my mother and I

193
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,417
are two separate
individuals.

194
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:42,166
Mm-hmm... and have you
enjoyed much success

195
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,375
with this approach,
Counselor?

196
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:50,500
No... but I do keep
reminding myself.

197
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,542
(<i> laughs</i> )

198
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:53,625
Good night.

199
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,291
Good night,
Counselor, and...

200
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,375
and thank you.

201
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,500
RIKER: Have you stopped
thinking about us?

202
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,083

00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:23,000
Have you stopped
thinking about us?

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,500
Just answer that.

208
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:32,875
I can't stop
thinking about you.

209
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,333
Will, don't.

Have you stopped

213
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,500
We mustn't do this.

214
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,166
Will, don't!

215
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,333
Will...
no!

Don't! Don't!

222

<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45430.9.</i>

227
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:46,500
<i>Counselor Troi</i>
<i>has fallen into a deep coma.</i>

228
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,917
<i>After thorough examination,</i>

229
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,709
<i>Dr. Crusher</i>

230
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:51,625
<i>signs of illness or infection.</i>

231
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,417
Any change,
Dr. Martin?

232
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,709
No, I'm still getting unusual
neural transmitter readings

233
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,500
in the diencephalon.

234
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,125
But they might be a
result of the coma.

235
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,875
Can you bring her
out of it?

236
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,875
I've tried standard
revival techniques.

237
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,333
She doesn't respond.

238
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,875
Until I find out
what's caused this,

239
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,792
I don't want to try anything
more extreme.

240
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,709
Do you know what she was
doing when this happened?

241
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:14,250
No. She was found in
her quarters this morning

242
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,041
when she didn't show up
for an appointment.

243
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,542
She was dressed for bed, but
the bed hadn't been slept in.

244
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:20,875
Who was the last person
to speak with her?

245
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,125
She left the dinner last night
with one of the Ullians.

246
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,458
I'll talk to him.

247
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,500
Ask if they would consent

248
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,667
to an examination,
just to be certain.

249
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,375
Mmm.

250
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,875
I'll check
the bio-filter readings

251
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,750
from the Ullian transporter log.

252
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,417
It's possible they could still
be carrying a harmful organism.

253
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:00,959
May I join you?

254
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,041
Commander...
of course.

255
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,583
Something's wrong?

256
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,125
Counselor Troi is ill.

257
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,542
I'm sorry to hear it.

258
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:09,542
She's more than ill,
she's in a coma.

259
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,458
Dr. Crusher doesn't
know what's causing it

260
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,792
or how to treat her.

261
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:14,125
When did this happen?

262
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,250
Apparently
sometime last night.

263
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,875
That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

264
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,500
You may have been the
last person to see her.

265
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,625
Did you go with her
into her quarters?

266
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,625
Are you suggesting that I
behaved improperly, Commander?

267
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:30,917
Not at all.

268
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:32,625
I'm just trying
to trace her steps.

269
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,458
We talked...
in a turbolift briefly.

270
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:41,542
She got out at deck eight.
I did not go with her.

271
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,959
Jev, I'm not accusing
you of anything.

272
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,250
Did she mention
feeling ill?

273
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,750
She seemed fine.

274
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,208
She has a wonderful
sense of humor.

275
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,625
If you have no objections,

276
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,417
Dr. Crusher would like to
examine you and your group.

277
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,500
To what end?
She's just trying to eliminate

278
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,000
the possibility that one of you
might be a carrying an organism

279
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,542
that was harmful
to Deanna.

280
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:10,458
I'm not implying that you
did anything intentional.

281
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,959
I'm just trying to get to
the bottom of the mystery.

282
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,583
We have nothing to hide.

283
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,333
If you wish to spend
time examining us--

284
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,083
Fine, thank you.

285
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,208
Deanna...

286
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,041
I don't know if
you can hear me.

287
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,000
I've-- I've heard doctors say

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,792
that even when someone's
in a coma,

289
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:51,750
they may be able to hear
when people talk to them...

290
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:57,333
that it might help stimulate
the brain, speed healing.

291
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,291
In fact, I think you
did that for me once,

292
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,166
when I was in pretty bad shape.

293
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:08,166
I just thought...

294
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,625
it might help to
hear a friendly voice...

295
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,000
even if you don't know
you're hearing it.

296
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,125
We've been busy
mapping the sector.

297
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,041
It's been pretty routine.

298
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:28,291
The most unusual thing we've
seen is a binary star system.

299
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,792
Let's see,
what else?

300
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:34,583
I've finished the personnel
review that we were working on.

301
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,458
You can check it out...

302
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,709
when you wake up.

303
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,792
I miss you.

304
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:52,875
Please, don't stay away
too long.

305
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,709
Will...

306
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,917
Will, I promise
I'll let you know

307
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:05,542
the minute she regains
consciousness.

308
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,041
I know.

309
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,834
There's nothing
you can do here.

310
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:11,333
You'll wear
yourself out.

311
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,875
All right.

312
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,917
It's late.
Go to bed.

313
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,375

00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,000
Answer, please.

355
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,959
Computer,
locate Commander Riker.

356
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:42,583
COMPUTER: Commander Riker
is in his quarters.

357
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,625
On my way, sir.

358
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,709
DR. CRUSHER:
<i>Medical Log, Stardate 45431.7.</i>

359
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:06,792
<i>Commander Riker</i>
<i>is the second officer</i>

360
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:09,250
<i>who has fallen into an</i>
<i>unexplained coma.</i>

361
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,917
<i>I have examined the Ullians,</i>
<i>and ruled out the possibility</i>

362
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:14,333
<i>that they carry</i>
<i>a harmful organism.</i>

363
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,458
I compared Deanna's
brain scan to the one

364
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,250
that I took during
her last physical.

365
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,709
There is a difference.

366
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:22,625
This time, there's a trace
of electropathic activity.

367
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,041
And Commander Riker?

368
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,250
I found the same pattern.
If I didn't know better,

369
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,250
I'd say they both had
Iresine Syndrome.

370
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,750
That's the only
medical condition

371
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,625
that would produce
that pattern.

372
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,083
What is Iresine Syndrome?

373
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,083
A very rare
neurological disorder

374
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,500
first diagnosed in
the 23rd century.

375
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,041
It's characterized by an
identical electropathic residue.

376
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,709
Why discount the possibility

377
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:44,750
that it's responsible
for these comas?

378
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,417
Iresine is always accompanied

379
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,917
by a severely decreased
histamine count.

380
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,417
Both Will and Deanna
showed normal levels.

381
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,875
I've asked
Commander La Forge

382
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,458
to conduct a shipwide
diagnostic

383
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,625
to determine any other agent
that might cause

384
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,583
the same
electropathic pattern.

385
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,667
Commander Riker and
Counselor Troi

386
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:04,125
were in perfect health
until the Ullians arrived.

387
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,417
It would be wise to quarantine
the aliens.

388
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,083
I believe that
it would be premature

389
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,667
to take that action, Mr. Worf.

390
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:13,583
There's no real evidence
linking these comas

391
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,000
with the Ullians.

392
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,875
That's true, but there
is something curious.

393
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,041
The electropathic residue
I discovered

394
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,000
is located in the thalamus.

395
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,125
That's the area
of the cerebral cortex

396
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,500
that involves memory function.

397
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,417
I've been accused
of putting people to sleep

398
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,959
with one too many
stories, Captain.

399
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,125
But this is the first time
it's ever been suggested

400
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,625
that I might be the
cause of someone's coma.

401
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,000
I mean no disrespect,
but we are faced

402
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,875
with an alarming situation.

403
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,542
Why do you suspect us,
Captain?

404
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,500
Suspect is perhaps
too strong a word.

405
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,417
I'm simply trying to
determine what has caused

406
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:49,542
two of my officers to
fall into comas.

407
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:51,834
But you've already
examined us.

408
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,500
We aren't carrying
anything harmful.

409
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,583
BEVERLY: In further
study of the victims,

410
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,375
I detected some
abnormal patterns

411
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,458
in the area of the brain
that involves memory.

412
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,625
In the light of your
telepathic abilities,

413
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,083
it raises the question.

414
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,709
Captain, it is not our
wish to obstruct you.

415
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:09,291
What would you like?

416
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:12,917
If I could do some further
examinations tomorrow--

417
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:15,750
perhaps monitor you
during a memory probe.

418
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,917
Scrutiny does not frighten us.

419
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,583
We will be happy
to cooperate, Doctor.

420
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:23,834
Thank you.

421
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:26,333
I'll contact you
in the morning.

422
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,250
Since you're
the only person on board

423
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,500
to undergo a memory probe
by the Ullians,

424
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,291
I'd like to do
a neurological work-up

425
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,625
and see if I can detect
any residual effect.

426
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,542
Dr. Martin will
monitor your vital signs

427
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:42,834
while I conduct the scan.

428
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:44,583
I'm happy to help.

429
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,917
Have you noticed
any unusual symptoms

430
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,458
since the probe?

431
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,834
Headaches,
dizziness?

432
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,125
No, nothing like that.

433
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:55,542
It was a wonderful
experience.

434
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,333
Electrical activity
is normal.

435
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,333
C.P.K. levels are normal.

436
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:05,625
Hippocampus is stable...
and the thalamus...

437
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,333
The thalamus is normal.

438
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:13,083
There is no indication at all
of any electropathic residual.

439
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,834
Is that good?

440
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:17,208
Oh, you're fine, Keiko.

441
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:20,208
But I am no closer to
solving this mystery.

442
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:24,333
Computer, locate
the electropathic pattern

443
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:27,208
described in medical database
four-delta-one.

444
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,583
COMPUTER:
Electropathic pattern located.

445
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:32,208
Okay, we're going to track down

446
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,250
any possible cause
of that brain pattern.

447
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,166
First, what are the medical
conditions

448
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,792
that might account for it?

449
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,667
COMPUTER:
Iresine Syndrome is a cause

450
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,875
of the electropathic pattern.

451
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,375
Right, and Dr. Crusher
already eliminated that.

452
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:49,083
So, how many non-medical
forces or substances

453
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,709
might cause the pattern?

454
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:53,333
COMPUTER:
There are 22 non-medical agents.

455
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:57,166
Okay, and how many of those
are present on the<i> Enterprise?</i>

456
00:24:57,166 --> 00:25:00,166
COMPUTER: None are present
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

457
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,750
Are the ship's
sensors calibrated

458
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,625
to detect all those agents?

459
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:06,208
COMPUTER: All agents are
scanned by the sensors.

460
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,500
Okay. Let's start
with the chemical substances.

461
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,250
Name them.

462
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,291
COMPUTER: Ferrazene,
hylanatine, dardilion,

463
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:21,709
chrysimite, and manzene.

464
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:23,125
Hmm.

465
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,542
Ferrazene has a complex
molecular structure.

466
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:29,166
It breaks down
into bilenium and tarrisite.

467
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,959
Do the sensors scan for those?

468
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:33,375
COMPUTER: Ship's sensors
scan for both compounds.

469
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,417
And are they present
on the<i> Enterprise?</i>

470
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:38,667
COMPUTER: Bilenium and
tarrisite are not present.

471
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:41,667
Do any of the substances
break down into by-products

472
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,417
that are not scanned for?

473
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,333
COMPUTER: Dardilion contains
the by-product nilizene.

474
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:49,792
Sensors do not routinely
scan for that substance.

475
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:52,333
Well, this isn't
a routine situation.

476
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,125
Scan for the nilizene.

477
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:57,041
COMUTER: There is no nilizene
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

478
00:25:57,041 --> 00:26:00,750
How did I know
you were gonna say that?

479
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,583
Okay, let's move on to the
non-chemical agents.

480
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,625
Anything more
I can do for you?

481
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,208
No, thanks.

482
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,875
I was just doing some reading
on the Iresine Syndrome.

483
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,875
If a new strain has developed,
that might explain

484
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,000
the normal histamine counts.

485
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,542
Any luck?

486
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,625
Not so far.

487
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,166
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

488
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,875
PICARD: You shouldn't
remember him like this.

489
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:46,083
You don't have to do this.

490
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:49,333
It's important to me.
I have to see him.

491
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:03,792
It's good of you
to come.

492
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:06,125
It's the least
I can do.

493
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,750
PICARD: You shouldn't
remember him like this.

494
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,125
BEVERLY: I have to face
the fact that he's gone.

495
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,917
You shouldn't
remember him like this.

496
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:31,792
It's good of you
to come with me.

497
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:33,750
It's the least I can do.

498
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:41,583
You shouldn't
remember him like this.

499
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,709
(<i> Jev's voice:</i> )
It's the least I can do.

500
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,041
(<i> gasps</i> )

501
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,959
(<i> screaming</i> )

502
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:07,417
I've spent two hours

503
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,291
having a cozy little
chat with the computer.

504
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,125
I've checked everything
I could think of--

505
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,000
any possible agent
that might cause

506
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,542
that electropathic pattern.

507
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:17,041
I assume from your tone of
voice you were unsuccessful.

508
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,750
Didn't find a thing.

509
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,166
Dr. Crusher's not gonna
be too happy with...

510
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,333
Emergency medical team

511
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,792
to Dr. Crusher's
office immediately.

512
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:40,041
Dr. Crusher had me working
on a shipwide diagnostic.

513
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:42,041
I'd gone to give her
the results when I found her.

514
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,792
Did your scans provide any
insights into these comas?

515
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,792
None. I've checked
and cross-checked.

516
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,208
They're just dead ends.

517
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:50,583
We seem to have eliminated all
of the known factors

518
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,250
which may have
caused the comas,

519
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,166
except for the Ullians.

520
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,709
Mr. Data, I want you
to investigate

521
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:59,333
those 11 planets
that the Ullians visited.

522
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:02,000
See if there were any reports
of unexplained comas.

523
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,041
Aye, sir.

524
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,542
In the meantime,
we must consider

525
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:08,583
restricting them
to their quarters

526
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,041
as a precautionary measure.

527
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,458
If one of them
is behind this,

528
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,208
will keeping telepaths
in their quarters

529
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,834
prevent it from
happening again?

530
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:16,750
What else can we do?

531
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,291
Station a guard?
Set up a force field?

532
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,417
I don't see that those will
be any more effective.

533
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:23,000
DR. MARTIN:
Sick Bay to Captain Picard.

534
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,500
Picard here.

535
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,375
DR. MARTIN: Counselor Troi
has regained consciousness.

536
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,709
She's asked for you, sir.

537
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:30,417
I'm on my way.

538
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:34,458
It's like waking up
from a nightmare,

539
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:36,917
and not remembering
what it was about.

540
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:39,458
What is the last thing
you do remember?

541
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,792
My hair.
I was brushing my hair.

542
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,041
And then?

543
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:51,125
(<i> sighs</i> )
I don't know.

544
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:53,083
Just waking up here.

545
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,250
Why do I feel so frightened?
What happened to me?

546
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,917
We were hoping
that you could tell us.

547
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,417
How long have I been here?

548
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,583
Three days.

549
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:11,041
Three days?

550
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:12,917
You were the first.

551
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:17,375
The next day, Commander Riker
fell into a similar coma.

552
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,709
Last night,
Dr. Crusher.

553
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:21,834
What is going on here?

554
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,792
We're not certain.

555
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:26,834
It may be that there
is some unusual effect

556
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:30,583
produced by the Ullians'
telepathic activity.

557
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,625
I'm gonna talk to them.
And in the meantime,

558
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:35,375
you are to stay here
and recuperate.

559
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,625
But if you remember anything
at all about what happened,

560
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:41,291
I want you to
tell me immediately.

561
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:54,500
What are you suggesting,
Captain?

562
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,625
That you voluntarily confine
yourself to your quarters,

563
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,917
at least until we have
unravelled this mystery.

564
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,250
We're to be prisoners?

565
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,750
Father.

566
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,542
PICARD: No, please,
don't look on it like that.

567
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:08,583
We have done
everything we can

568
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,500
to explain these comas.

569
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,709
We have performed
physical examinations,

570
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:14,083
neurological scans.

571
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,959
We have conducted
a shipwide diagnostic

572
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:21,250
looking for viruses,
parasites, infestations.

573
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,792
We have investigated every
possible cause we could imagine,

574
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,166
and we have found nothing--

575
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:29,625
nothing to explain
these comas.

576
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:34,333
The only variable that we have
not been able to eliminate

577
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,500
is your presence
here on this ship.

578
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,750
Now, in the light
of our actions,

579
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,625
we would ask you to understand
my request and to agree to it.

580
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,917
Captain, our history indicates

581
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:55,083
that we do not adversely affect
the people we contact.

582
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,083
I know that.

583
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,917
Then... are you implying
an intentional assault?

584
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:04,834
I'm simply considering
all possibilities.

585
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:06,208
Surely, you would
give us the chance

586
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:07,667
to prove that we're innocent?

587
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,542
If that's possible,
of course.

588
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:11,875
Well, then I would propose

589
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,041
doing a memory probe
of Counselor Troi.

590
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:16,041
You have said

591
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:18,792
that she doesn't remember
anything that happened

592
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:21,166
before she lapsed
into unconsciousness.

593
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,583
I could retrieve that memory.

594
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:27,208
There is a possibility that
it could explain the coma

595
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:28,709
and prove our innocence.

596
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:33,792
I'm sorry, I couldn't possibly
subject Counselor Troi

597
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,041
to a potentially
dangerous procedure.

598
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:40,083
And I refuse to be a party
to any of these proceedings.

599
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,417
Jev is making a reasonable
request, Captain.

600
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:46,959
If we're to be accused,

601
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:49,834
surely, we're entitled
to a defense.

602
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:53,667
Tarmin did a memory
probe on another

603
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:54,875
of your crew.

604
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,917
Has she suffered
any ill effects?

605
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:58,166
No.

606
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,667
And neither will
Counselor Troi.

607
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,208
Please.

608
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,000
You may have as many
people there as you need

609
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,041
to guarantee her safety.

610
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:11,125
But give us this chance
to vindicate ourselves.

611
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:17,500
I will discuss the matter
with Counselor Troi.

612
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:26,750
Well, that's it
for Melina II.

613
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,458
No unexplained comas
during the time

614
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:31,166
the Ullians
were working there.

615
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:32,667
We have yet to
receive transmission

616
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,542
from the two planets
of the Nel system.

617
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:36,458
Perhaps they will
show different results.

618
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,625
Maybe...

619
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:42,792
and maybe we're not checking
for the right thing.

620
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:44,417
Please clarify.

621
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:47,542
We haven't looked into the
comas that<i> were</i> explained.

622
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,166
Why would we do that?

623
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:52,500
Well, remember what
Dr. Crusher said

624
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,417
right after Counselor Troi
became unconscious--

625
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,709
that it looked exactly
like Iresine Syndrome,

626
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:58,291
except for the
histamine count?

627
00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,542
Yes.

628
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:01,583
Well, maybe not
every medical facility

629
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,458
is as careful as Dr. Crusher.

630
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,375
Maybe it's easier to
just make a quick diagnosis

631
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,500
rather than keep hunting
for the real cause.

632
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,291
You are searching for instances
of Iresine Syndrome.

633
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,458
Right...
And correlating them

634
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:17,041
with the visits by
the Ullians and...

635
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,625
And there we are.

636
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,834
Two cases of
Iresine Syndrome

637
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:22,417
on Hurada III,

638
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:26,041
at exactly the time Tarmin
and his group were there.

639
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,458
Let's check
the other planets.

640
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,458
I think we may have
something here.

641
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,542
Counselor,
I want to reiterate.

642
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:34,375
If you have any
doubts whatsoever

643
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:37,458
about this procedure, you don't
have to go through with it.

644
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,834
I want to do it, Captain.

645
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:41,417
Something awful
happened to me,

646
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,750
and I don't even
know what it was.

647
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,041
Very well.

648
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,917
Counselor, what's the
last thing you remember

649
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:53,458
about the other night?

650
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,709
Brushing my hair.

651
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,750
Would you get
your hairbrush?

652
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,667
Tell me about
brushing your hair.

653
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,208
Do you do it
every night?

654
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,250
Yes, when I'm ready
for bed.

655
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,417
What is it?

656
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,792
Someone's touching my hair.

657
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:27,333
Someone's with you
in the room?

658
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,875
No.

659
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:34,375
No, I'm alone.
There's no one there.

660
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,125
Go on.

661
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:41,083
I get some hot chocolate.

662
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:45,291
Something's happening.

663
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:48,125
I'm alone in my quarters.

664
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:51,417
I'm remembering something
from a few years ago.

665
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:53,917
Go back into
that memory.

666
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:57,041
You said... someone
was touching your hair?

667
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:02,000
Yes... and...

668
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:08,166
it's Will Riker.

669
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,291
That's right.
I was thinking of him.

670
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:14,000
Remembering a time when
you were with him.

671
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,834
Yes, after a poker game.

672
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:19,291
It's a pleasant memory.
Stay with it.

673
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:25,041
(<i> gasping</i> )

674
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:28,625
Now, he's hurting me.

675
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:32,792
You're... you're frightened.

676
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,542
I want him to stop.

677
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:36,542
(<i> sobbing</i> )

678
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,583
(<i> gasps</i> )

679
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:45,000
It's not Will.

680
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,583
Somebody's taken
his place.

681
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,125
Someone else is there,
who is it?

682
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,709
(<i> crying</i> )
No...

683
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,709
he shouldn't be here.

684
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:54,291
Why is he here?

685
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:57,208
Stop.
You're hurting me.

686
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,417
Can you see his face?

687
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,542
Yes.

688
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:02,834
(<i> sobbing</i> )

689
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,750
<i>Imzadi...</i>

690
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,375
No! Stop!

691
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:10,291
You're hurting me!

692
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:12,375
Who is it?

693
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,125
Who is doing this to you?

694
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:16,125
(<i> gasps</i> )

695
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,834
It's Tarmin.

696
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,417
It's your father.

697
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:47,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45433.2.</i>

698
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:49,959
<i>We have set a course</i>
<i>for Starbase 440</i>

699
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:52,333
<i>where the Ullians</i>
<i>will disembark</i>

700
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,917
<i>and return home.</i>

701
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:56,667
Inad and I have contacted
our home planet.

702
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,583
If you want to
prosecute my father,

703
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,500
the authorities there
will support you.

704
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,834
I'm not sure we have any legal
basis for such a prosecution.

705
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:10,291
Memory invasion
is simply not a crime

706
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,125
that we've ever had
to contend with.

707
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:15,208
According to what I've
just learned, it's a practice

708
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:18,458
that was abolished on our world
centuries ago.

709
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:21,125
What could motivate
someone like your father

710
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,375
to commit such an act?

711
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,417
I don't know.

712
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:28,750
A perverse source
of pleasure, perhaps.

713
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,792
A way to exercise control
over another.

714
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:35,792
Your father claims,

715
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:38,250
quite strenuously,
that he's innocent.

716
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,875
(<i> chuckles</i> )
My father has never been one

717
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:43,333
to admit that he's wrong.

718
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:46,750
But it is difficult to believe
he'd be capable of this.

719
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:53,875
I am told that the punishment
for this crime is quite severe.

720
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:04,959
We are monitoring my father's
telepathic activities.

721
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:06,291
You have my assurance

722
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:09,083
he won't assault
anyone else.

723
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,625
I am sorry for this, Captain.

724
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,667
Picard to Commander Data.

725
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:23,875
DATA: Yes, Captain?

726
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,166
How's your search coming?

727
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,041
We have uncovered
several cases, sir,

728
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:29,542
but have not yet completed
our investigation.

729
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,917
We'll inform the medical
personnel on those planets

730
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:35,166
that we have discovered the
true nature of the comas.

731
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,959
I'm sure they'll appreciate
knowing what really happened.

732
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,000
Yes, sir. We will
keep searching, sir.

733
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,125
We just got the transmission
from the Nel system, Data.

734
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,917
No mention of
Iresine Syndrome,

735
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,667
but there are two
unexplained comas

736
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,625
on one planet,
none on the other.

737
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,625
And were the
Ullians present?

738
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:54,166
Checking the mission logs.

739
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:57,375
That's funny.

740
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:01,917
On stardates
45321 and 45323,

741
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,583
when the comas occurred,

742
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,667
Tarmin was on
his home planet.

743
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:08,375
He wasn't anywhere
near the Nel system.

744
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,125
(<i> door chimes</i> )

745
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,875
Come in.

746
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:18,000
Hello, Jev.

747
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,625
We'll be reaching
starbase soon.

748
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,166
I wanted to say good-bye

749
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:24,333
and to apologize
again for my father.

750
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,917
There's no need.

751
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:28,583
You're not responsible
for what he did.

752
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,959
Before all this
happened, I...

753
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:33,166
I had hoped we
might become friends.

754
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,917
We still can.

755
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:37,375
After what he's
put you through?

756
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:40,083
Maybe you can forget.

757
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm not sure I can.

758
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,625
You're so lovely.

759
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,000
I have to go.

760
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,750
Good-bye.

761
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,875
Jev... you're upset.

762
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,750
Would you like to talk?

763
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,166
No.

764
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,333
You'd feel better
if you did.

765
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,208
Why do you have
to be so nice?

766
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:18,917
So... so lovely.

767
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:31,917
What... what's happening?

768
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,250
It's happening again.

769
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:46,000
You're so beautiful...

770
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,583
so fragile.

771
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:51,583
It was you.

772
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:55,083
It was always you.

773
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:57,166
Have you stopped
thinking about us?

774
00:41:57,166 --> 00:42:00,125
No!

775
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,583
(<i> whimpering</i> )

776
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,709
No..

777
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,083
No! No!

778
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:10,125
Don't! Don't!

779
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,917
I won't let you.

780
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,375
No!

781
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,917
(<i> screams</i> )

782
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,625
DATA:
Counselor...

783
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:28,875
are you all right?

784
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:30,709
Yes.

785
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:41,542
Why are you here?
How did you know?

786
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:44,250
We discovered two instances
of unexplained coma

787
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,458
on Nel Three while
the Ullians were there,

788
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:48,208
but Tarmin was not
part of the group.

789
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,875
Further examination
revealed

790
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:51,417
that there was only
one Ullian present

791
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:55,208
for all incidents
of coma-- Jev.

792
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45435.8.</i>

<i>Dr. Crusher and Commander Riker</i>
<i>regained consciousness</i>

794
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,333

<i>to the Ullian home world.</i>

795
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:12,667
<i>The slow process</i>
<i>of their recovery has begun.</i>

796
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:15,583
I have asked that the finest
physicians on my world

797
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,834
meet with you all
upon our return, to help you

798
00:43:18,834 --> 00:43:20,458
in your healing process.

799
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:22,667
They've been in contact
with us already.

800
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:23,917
Thank you.

801
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:25,583
It's been three centuries

802
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:29,291
since we treated
anyone for this...

803
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:30,792
this form of rape.

804
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:34,208
But there are medical
records from that era.

805
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:37,792
It was a time of great
violence for my people--

806
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:40,959
a time we thought we had
put far behind us.

807
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:45,959
That this could happen now...

808
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,500
is unimaginable.

809
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,709
Earth was once
a violent planet too.

810
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:53,709
At times, the chaos threatened
the very fabric of life.

811
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:56,208
But like you, we evolved.

812
00:43:56,208 --> 00:44:00,250
We found better ways to
handle our conflicts.

813
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,500
But I think no one can deny

814
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:08,375
that the seed of violence
remains within each of us.

815
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:14,291
We must recognize that,
because that violence

816
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:18,041
is capable of
consuming each of us,

817
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:20,250
as it consumed your son.
