Oh, you really did it
this time, Will.

3
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:07,417
I mean, this is not
just a scrape.

4
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:09,792
This is a very deep cut.

5
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:14,333
Well, I can heal it, of course

6
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,792
but you've got to stop
playing Parrises Squares

7
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,625
as if you're 21 years old.

8
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,750
One of these days,
you're going to fall
and break your neck

9
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:24,166
and I'm not going to be able
to heal that as easily.

10
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,333
I wasn't playing
Parrises Squares.

11
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,166

12
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,375
No.

13
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:31,583
I give up.
What was it?

14
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,125
I was trying to feed Spot.

15
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,542
Data's cat?

16
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,583
I told him I would feed
him while he was gone.

17
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,083
I was putting down
the bowl of food.

18
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,583
The next thing I know

19
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,458
there's a hissing ball
of fur coming at my face.

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,959
I hate cats.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,458
I love cats.

22
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,333
You know, you've just got
to know how to handle them.

23
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,667
Maybe you'd
like to do it.

24
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:51,375
I would be honored if I could...

00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,083

27
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,542
Oh, by the way...

28
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,041
you'll need this.

29
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,417
Report.

30
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,250
We're picking up

32
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,625
It is Romulan, sir.

33
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:14,166
Romulan.

34
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,583
They claim they have suffered
a complete engine failure.

35
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,792
Power levels are dropping.

36
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:23,083
Life-support is failing.

37
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,166
Could be a trick.

38
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:30,250
How long before we rendezvous
with Captain Picard?

39
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,291
Approximately 13 hours.

40
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,542
Lay in a course

41
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,625
Let's put up the shields
and go to red alert.

42
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,125

when this Ktarian
walks up to me and says

55
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,583
(<i> imitating</i> ):
"Hello, Diane.

56
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:20,834
"I understand you're an empath.

"I'm doing a thesis

Would you care to join me

60
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,458
That's a very good impression
of Dr. Mizan.

61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,542
How did you know?

62
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,792
He's notorious

63
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:43,959
but he really is an expert

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,417
on interspecies
mating practices.

65
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,500
Did you help him
with his research, Counselor?

66
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,208
Absolutely not.

67
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,375
I thought it was a topic

68
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:53,875
you were interested in.

69
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:56,667
How did you enjoy

70
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,166
the rest of the conference,
Counselor?

71
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,166
To be honest, I was bored.

72
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,792
I spent most of my time

73
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:05,166
at Professor Wagner's
phylobiology seminar.

74
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,375
I thought the idea
of the seminar

75
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,208
was that we would
all participate--

76
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,083
bring different points of view
to the discussion.

77
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:16,875
He gathered 200 scientists
from all over the Federation

78
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:19,291
and all he did
was put us to sleep.

79
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,709
I have a memory record of
the entire lecture, Counselor.

80
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,875
I could repeat

81
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:23,959
the portions
you missed...

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,333
No, thank you, Data.

83
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,208
PICARD:
Well, it was little better

84
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,417
at the physiognomy workshop.

85
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:34,250
Dr. Fassbinder
gave an hour-long dissertation

86
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:39,000
on the ionization effect
of warp nacelles

87
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,667
before he realized

88
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,291
that the topic was supposed
to be... psychology.

89
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,917
Why didn't anybody tell him?

90
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,583
There was no opportunity.

91
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,500
There was no pause.

92
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,333
(<i> droning</i> ):
He just kept talking

93
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:57,917
in one long,
incredibly unbroken sentence

94
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,083
moving from topic to topic

95
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,542
so that no one had a chance
to interrupt.

96
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,625
It was really quite hypnotic.

97
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:09,083
LA FORGE:
Well, I had a great time.

98
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,959
The warp energy symposium
was fascinating.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,792
I actually had an opportunity
to touch a plasma field.

100
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:17,166
Really?
What was it like?

101
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,166
Oh, it was incredible.

102
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,500
I could feel the plasma
moving up my arm.

103
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,166
It was warm and...

104
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:28,458
Oh, and there was this amazing
tingling sensation that...

105
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,333
Captain?

106
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,208
Data.

107
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,250
...moved through my chest.

108
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,709
It was incredible.

109
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,166
It was like
taking a bath

110
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,875
in pure energy.

111
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,667
It was not painful?

112
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:56,125
Oh, no. I...

113
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,458

114
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,542
Is there
something wrong?

115
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,250
I'm not sure.

to you that we were frozen?

127
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,041
I don't know.

128
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,709
Four, maybe five seconds.

129
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,709
You just stopped,
and then started again.

130
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,000
I can't explain it.

131
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,125
My memory record
does not indicate a pause

132
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,375
or a disruption
during that time period.

133
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:36,834
My internal chronometer
and the ship's computer

134
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,875
are both perfectly
synchronized.

135
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,750
There does not appear to be
a temporal discrepancy.

Let's go through
all this again.

139
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:55,083
You were sitting there.

when we appeared to freeze.

143
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,667
about what it felt like
to touch the plasma field

144
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,709
and you were taking
a sip of tea.

145
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,333
Did you sense something
from any of us at that time--

146
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,125
any unusual emotion?

147
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,208
Not a thing.

148
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,291
I was empathically aware of you

149
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,542
right up to the moment
when you froze

150
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,750
and then it all stopped.

151
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,625
(<i> sighs</i> )

152
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,542
The last few days
have been exhausting.

153
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,542
Maybe it was my imagination.

154
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,875
There were moments
in that lecture hall

155
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:42,583
when I thought time
was standing still there, too.

156
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,500
Well, there is another
possibility, Counselor.

157
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:48,834
This could be nothing more
than simp...

158
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,333
Oh! Oh.

159
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,917

You were motionless

162
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,375
for three minutes, 11 seconds.

163
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:00,000
It appears to be
the same effect

164
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,542
that you described in us.

165
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,125
Do you remember anything?

166
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,291
No. One second,
I was talking to you

167
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,500
and the next, you were
all standing around me.

168
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:10,333
LA FORGE:
Wait a second.
This is weird.

169
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,917
What is it?

170
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,875
I had the tricorder
run a comparison

171
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,500
between the bio-scan
I took on you earlier

172
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:18,917
and the one
I ran just now.

173
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,542
In the time between
the two scans

174
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,125
you should have aged
23 minutes

175
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,709
but according to your
cellular decay levels

176
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,083
you've only aged
20 minutes.

177
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,625
How do you account
for this discrepancy?

178
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,333
LA FORGE:
I don't know, sir.

179
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,333
It's as if,

180
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,792

time just stopped.

00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,542
Mr. Data, contact
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

182
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,083
Tell Commander Riker

183
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,834
to meet us at the rendezvous
point as soon as possible.

184
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,125
Have him scan the region

185
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,542
for temporal anomalies.

186
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,000
Aye, sir.

187
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,208
I'll check
the sensor logs--

188
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,625
see if I can
find anything.

189
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,583
DATA:
Captain, may I see you?

190
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,625
The<i> Enterprise</i> is not
responding to our hails.

191
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,750
Are we within
sensor range?

192
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,667
No, sir.

193
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:18,125
Increase speed
to the rendezvous coordinates.

194
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,125
Aye, sir.

195
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,250
(<i> low rumbling</i> )

196
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,959
(<i> warning beeps</i> )

197
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,625
We have an engine-failure
warning in...

198
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,166
Report!

199
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,875
The starboard nacelle
just cut out.

200
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,333
Attitude control
has been restored.

201
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,000
Full stop.
What happened?

202
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,166
The starboard antimatter pod
is completely drained.

203
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,542
The fuel reserves are empty.

204
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,083
Is there a
fuel containment leak?

205
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,375
No, sir, the containment
field is intact.

206
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:01,667
All engine systems
are operational.

207
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:04,208
The fuel is just gone.

208
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,750
Geordi

209
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,333
I believe I have an explanation.

210
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,291
According to the plasma
conversion sensor

211
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,917
the starboard engine has been
in continuous operation

212
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,166
for 47 days.

213
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,792
47 days?

214
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:16,917
Aw...
let's check that sensor.

215
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,208
It must be malfunctioning.

216
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,667
I'll check
the fuel consumption logs.

217
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,625
(<i> screaming</i> )

218
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:02,959
What happened?

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,792
My hand.

220
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:10,583
Your cells are metabolizing
at an incredible speed--

221
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,583
almost 50 times normal.

222
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,208
The pain is going away.

223
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,458
Your metabolism's
stabilizing.

224
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,667
It happened when I reached
for the bowl of fruit.

225
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,792
Captain, I am detecting
a temporal disturbance

226
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,083
intersecting
the table.

227
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,250
It appears that
within the disturbance

228
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,500
time is moving
at an accelerated rate--

229
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:40,959
approximately 50 times
faster than normal.

230
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,917
The disturbance
is spherical in shape.

231
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:46,917
It is extending outward
from the hull

232
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,834
approximately 17 meters
from the ship.

233
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,500
That would cover
the starboard nacelle.

234
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,583
No wonder it used
up all its fuel.

235
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,583
Check the hull integrity.

236
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,917
It does not appear
to be affected.

237
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,792
Mr. La Forge,
see if you can

238
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:09,917
move us away from
the disturbance.

239
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,208
Aye, sir.

240
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:30,834
Lateral thrusters on line.

241
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:34,417
Data, plot a course
away from the disturbance.

242
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,417
Make sure it doesn't come in
contact with our other engine.

243
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,500
Course plotted.

244
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:41,083
Adjust pitch to 27.3 degrees.

245
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,083
Set heading--

246
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,500
<i>180 mark zero.</i>

247
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:45,709
Got it.

248
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,125
Reversing at 15 meters
per second.

249
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,125
DATA:
We are clearing the phenomenon.

250
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,375
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

251
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,500
All stop.

252
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,375
What was that?

253
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:59,458
There is another temporal
disturbance directly behind us.

254
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,375
Captain

255
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:05,625
I think you'd better come
take a look at this.

256
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,291
Yes, Mr. La Forge?

257
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,250
The sensors are picking up
temporal disturbances

258
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,166
throughout the region.

259
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,250
Different configurations,
different sizes--

260
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,417
they're everywhere.

261
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,041
DATA:
Within each disturbance

262
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,875
it appears that time is moving
at a different rate.

263
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,250
It's almost as if something

264
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,083
has shattered
the space-time continuum.

265
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,959
The fragmentation
effect continues

266
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,041
along a heading
of 270 mark 15.

267
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,291
That's the direction
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

268
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,500
Can we navigate
around these fragments?

269
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:50,208
We'll have to limit
our maneuvering speed

270
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,417
to one-half impulse

271
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,417
but I think
we can do it.

272
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,208
Get us to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

273
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,583
These are the coordinates.

274
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:19,333
Perhaps the<i> Enterprise</i> 
has been delayed.

275
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,208
I've got the long-range
sensors on maximum, sir.

276
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,041
There's no sign
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

277
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,125
But I am picking up
a faint reading--

278
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,291
possibly metallic.

279
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,125
It's difficult
to tell.

280
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,500
The energy levels
are practically nonexistent.

281
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:32,542
Take us to it.

282
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,792
Aye, sir.

283
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,208
DATA:
The fragmentation effect

284
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,792
is increasing.

285
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:39,041
Slowing to one-eighth impulse.

286
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,750
There she is.

287
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:52,959
My God.

288
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,875
Mr. Data?

289
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,834
The<i> Enterprise</i> 
and the warbird

290
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,458
both appear
to be trapped

291
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,000
within one
of the temporal fragments.

292
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,250
LA FORGE:
The fragments seem
to be converging

293
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,458
at about this point.

294
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,458
I'd say we're looking
at the center

295
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,917
of the temporal
disturbances.

296
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,208
Scan for life signs.

297
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,583
Sensors cannot penetrate
the subspace field.

298
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,917
I am unable to scan
within the vessels.

299
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,667
TROI:
It looks like
the<i> Enterprise</i> 

300
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:31,834
has been damaged.

301
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,375
There,
on the port nacelle.

302
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:37,834
The warbird doesn't look to have
sustained any damage at all.

303
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,083
I wonder if the<i> Enterprise</i>

304
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,667
even had time
to get off a shot.

305
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,291
The Romulans
could have de-cloaked

306
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,959
before the<i> Enterprise</i> 
had a chance to respond.

307
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,625
There's a second energy beam.

308
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,000
It's coming from the<i> Enterprise</i> 
deflector array.

309
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,875
Do you have any idea
what that could be?

310
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:52,583
DATA:
It is impossible to tell
from a visual inspection.

311
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,500
However,
it appears to be focused

312
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,667
on the warbird's
Engineering section.

313
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:00,500
Well, we're not going to be able
to determine anything from here.

314
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,542
We need to get on board
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

315
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,333
That would be inadvisable, sir.

316
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,083
In each of the three
instances

317
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,166
we came into contact

318
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,583
with one
of the temporal fragments

319
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,542
we were integrated
into its time frame.

320
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,208
If we beamed aboard
the<i> Enterprise</i>

321
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,333
we'd be frozen in time
just like they are.

322
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,792
Well, we have to find some way
of staying unfrozen.

323
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:21,458
Mr. La Forge, what about
a subspace force field

324
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,792
like the one we used
on Devidia II?

325
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,709
Could something like that
protect us

326
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,834
from the effects
of the temporal fragment?

327
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,500
Possibly, but we'd need

328
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:31,875
an awfully sensitive
phase discriminator

329
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,000
in order to moderate
that kind of field.

330
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,917
The emergency transporter
armbands

331
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:38,458
contain a type-seven
phase discriminator.

332
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,792
It should be possible
to reconfigure

333
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:41,917
their subspace emitters.

334
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,333
Yeah.

335
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,792
Yeah, that would
certainly isolate us

336
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:46,625
from the effects of
the other time frame

337
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:49,667
but if we wanted to interact
with that environment

338
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,625
we'd have to
restrict the field.

339
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:55,875
It would have to be

340
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,208
practically skintight.

341
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,500
Mr. Data.

342
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:01,709
I will attempt
to narrow the field, sir.

343
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,333
LA FORGE:
Captain, I think
this is going to work

344
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,792
but... it's going
to take some time.

345
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,834
Well, Mr. La Forge

346
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,417
it would seem
that time is something

347
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,291
that we have plenty of.

348
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,792
I've channeled
all communications

349
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:31,750
through the subspace relays
in the armbands.

350
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,291
That way, we'll be able to be
in continual communication.

351
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,291
How long will the fields last?

352
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,000
About an hour,
maybe less.

353
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,250
Don't worry.

354
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,792
I'll be monitoring you
very carefully.

355
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,583
Oh.

356
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,083
Counselor.

357
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,000
I got a little dizzy
for a second.

358
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,041
We've created an artificial
pocket of time around you

359
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,834
so it's probably playing tricks
with your equilibrium.

360
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,959
It might take a little while
to get used to it.

361
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,917
You let me know if it
gets any worse.
Mm-hmm.

362
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,667
Beam us directly
to the<i> Enterprise</i> Bridge.

363
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,000
Aye, sir.

364
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,792
Energizing.

365
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,000
There are three Romulans

366
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,583
all of them with disrupters

367
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,959
one at conn.

368
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,166
There are none
of our security officers

369
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,417
on the Bridge.

370
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,291
They must have taken us
by surprise.

371
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,458
It appears that we
can move objects

372
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,166
in this time frame.

373
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,208
Maybe we could do something
to help Will.

374
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,709
I'm wary about making changes
in this time continuum

375
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,458
until we understand more
about what's going on.

376
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,667
Captain, the equipment
is no longer functioning.

377
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,458
However, the information
currently displayed

378
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,625
indicates there was a massive
power surge in Engineering.

379
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,083
Security teams
had just been sent

380
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,667
to Transporter Room Three
and to Sick Bay.

381
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:29,834
Counselor, will you go
to Sick Bay and investigate?

382
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,667
Mr. Data, go to
main Engineering.

383
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:32,834
See if you
can determine

384
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,083
the cause of that power surge.

385
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,375
I'll be
in Transporter Room Three.

386
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:36,542
Mr. La Forge.

387
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,792
La Forge here, sir.

388
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,166
Will you lock on to our signals?

389
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,041
I want you to transport
Counselor Troi to...

390
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,125
I'd rather not, Captain.

391
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,750
We've got limited power

392
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:46,834
and your isolation fields
consume a lot of energy.

393
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,542
Understood.

394
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,834
We'll use the Jefferies tube.

395
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,208
Let's go.

396
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,375
TROI:
Maybe we can
go around them.

397
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:29,959
No.

398
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,917
We'll find an alternative route.

399
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,750
Let's go back up.

400
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,333
(<i> gasping</i> )

401
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,500
(<i> sighing</i> )

402
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,750
(<i> gasping</i> )

403
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,583
Excuse me, Mr. Worf.

404
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,250
Captain...

405
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,041
Counselor,
take a look at this.

406
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,208
It appears that Mr. Worf had
just beamed these three on board

407
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,959
and according to this

408
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,792
three other Romulans
had been beamed

409
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:14,000
directly to Sick Bay
just seconds earlier.

410
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,417
I know, I just
saw them.

411
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,125
What are we doing
transporting Romulans

412
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,375
on board the ship
in the middle of a battle?

413
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:23,834
They don't have
any weapons

414
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,333
and that one
looks injured.

415
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,083
If they were part
of an invasion

416
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,291
then why are they unarmed?

417
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,750
It doesn't make any sense.

418
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,125
Captain, there's something
I have to tell you.

419
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,125
Dr. Crusher has been hit
by a disrupter blast

420
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,750
at point-blank range.

421
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,083
If time returns to normal

422
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,500
I don't see how
she can survive.

423
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:41,917
Data to Captain Picard.

424
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,417
Go ahead, Mr. Data.

425
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,542
Please come
to Engineering immediately.

426
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,875
It is urgent.

427
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:07,250
What's the problem,
Mr. Data?

428
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,625
Captain, I believe

429
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,166
I have found the cause
of the power surge.

430
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,917
There is a warp core
breach in progress.

431
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:26,542
It is the flash point
of a warp core explosion

432
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,333
and it is expanding.

433
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,834
Expanding?

434
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,667
I thought that time
was suspended on this ship.

435
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,250
We were incorrect, sir.

436
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,667
I have determined that
time is moving forward

437
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,583
at an infinitesimal rate.

438
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,709
Why didn't we
notice it before?

439
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,333
Our initial
conclusion was based

440
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,083
on our observations
of the crew.

441
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,875
The warp core breach moves
at a much faster rate.

442
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,834
The motion of the cloud

443
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,583
is within my visual
detection threshold.

444
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,792
At its current rate
of expansion

445
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,667
it will consume
the<i> Enterprise</i>

446
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:00,125
in approximately
nine hours, 17 minutes.

447
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,792
Is there anything
we can do to stop it?

448
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,667
It is no longer a question
of stopping it, sir.

449
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:08,875
The explosion
has already occurred.

450
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:13,375
The fact that it is moving
slowly changes nothing.

451
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,917
Astonishing to see it
frozen like this.

452
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:22,458
Do we know
what caused the breach?

453
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,250
No. However, the console
displays indicate

454
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,250
a power transfer
in progress

455
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,208
between the<i> Enterprise</i> 
and the Romulan ship

456
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,375
at the moment
time decelerated.

457
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,125
That is why
there is a second beam

458
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,375
between the two ships.

459
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,333
Why would we be
sending them power?

460
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:40,709
Perhaps we should go
aboard the Romulan ship.

461
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,166
The answer
to that question may...

462
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,917
(<i> Picard laughing</i> )

463
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,500
Captain?

464
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:06,834
(<i> gasping</i> )

465
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,542
Captain,
are you all right?

466
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:12,917
My head.

467
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,917
Oh...

468
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:17,375
Dizzy.

469
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:19,458
I can't...

470
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,041
No!

471
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,458
No! No!

472
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,959
No!

473
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,166
Troi to la Forge!
Get us out of here, now!

474
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,458
No! No!

475
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:43,166
It looks like you weren't
completely protected

476
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,834
from the effects
of the other time continuum.

477
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:48,667
The neuro-physical stress
must have been overwhelming.

478
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:51,667
DATA:
In much the same way
deep-sea divers

479
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,583
experience
nitrogen narcosis

480
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:56,500
you experienced a form
of temporal narcosis.

481
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,083
PICARD:
Can we modify
the subspace isolators

482
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,291
to give us
better protection?

483
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,250
LA FORGE:
I don't think so.

484
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,709
I'd say the best thing
we can do right now
is to be careful--

485
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,667
limit our exposure
to their time frame.

486
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,000
I'd say no longer
than ten minutes per trip

487
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,458
and we should probably
stick together

488
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,125
while we're there,
just in case.

489
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,792
Very well.

490
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,250
Well, the first step is to find
out why the<i> Enterprise</i>

491
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,500
was transferring power
to the Romulan ship.

492
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,959
I think we should
begin our search

493
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,625
in the Romulan Engine Room.

494
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:23,959
Counselor

495
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,625
you spent several days
on a Romulan vessel.

496
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:29,792
You probably know more about
the layouts than anyone here.

497
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:31,291
Perhaps...

498
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,083
(<i> moaning</i> )

499
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:37,250
Captain, it might be better
if you stayed here this time

500
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:40,166
and gave yourself
a chance to recover.

501
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:44,041
Yes, very well.

502
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,083
I will monitor
your progress from here

503
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:48,875
but just remember--
ten minutes, no more.

504
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,250
TROI:
Yes, Captain.

505
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,792
Geordi, there should be a power
utilization monitor over there.

506
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:10,083
Data.

507
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,875
This is
highly unusual.

508
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:23,250
The crew is not
at battle stations.

509
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:25,750
The ship is on
evacuation alert.

510
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,333
Is that why the Romulans
were being transported

511
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,083
to the<i> Enterprise?</i>

512
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,583
Take a look at this.

513
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:35,625
There's an energy feedback

514
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,458
returning through
the transfer beam.

515
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,583
It's probably what overloaded
the<i> Enterprise's</i> engines

516
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,500
and caused the core breach.

517
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,834
DATA:
Perhaps the warbird was trying
to destroy the<i> Enterprise.</i>

518
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,041
I don't think so.

519
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,208
According to this

520
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,542
the Romulans were
actually trying

521
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,959
to shut down
the power transfer.

522
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,291
Whatever happened,
this is beginning

523
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,709
to look less and less
like a Romulan attack.

524
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,208
Data, why don't
we take a look

525
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,583
at their engine readouts?

526
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,667
Geordi, the engine core
is completely inactive.

527
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:09,875
That's impossible.

528
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:13,083
The Romulans use an artificial
quantum singularity

529
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,625
as their power source.

530
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:17,500
Once it's activated,
it can't be shut down.

531
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:19,917
Well, let's take
a closer look.

532
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,875
I think we found
the problem.

533
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:44,583
It appears to be
a highly focused aperture

534
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:46,542
in the space-time continuum.

535
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,542
Its energy signature
matches that

536
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,959
of the temporal fragments
we observed earlier.

537
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,417
However, it is approximately
1.2 million times as intense.

538
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:59,458
I believe this may be the origin
of the temporal fragmentation.

539
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,542
What are those
dark spots?

540
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,291
I am not certain.

541
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:07,000
They exhibit a complex
bioelectric pattern

542
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,000
very possibly organic.

543
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,500
Organic?

544
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,041
From the molecular
configuration, it appears...

545
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,750
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

546
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:17,208
The aperture is beginning
to fluctuate.

547
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,291
I believe...

548
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,834
ROMULAN 1:
There is an energy buildup

549
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:23,959
in the phase
compensation levels.

550
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,834
ROMULAN 2:
Check the main
distribution matrix.

551
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,750
That's not it--
the matrix is clear.

552
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,500
It's the power transfer
from the<i> Enterprise.</i>

553
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:30,959
I'm reading
a massive feedback.

554
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,667
Systems are beginning
to overload.

555
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:35,000
Notify the<i> Enterprise</i>

556
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,083
to shut down the power
transfer immediately.

557
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,417
They're unable to comply.

558
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,500
Their power interlocks
won't disengage.

559
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,083
We'll have to interrupt
it ourselves.

560
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,291
Disconnect
the transfer beam.

561
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,709
ROMULAN 3:
There is no pressure.

562
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,542
ROMULAN 2:
There is an impending
warp core breach.

563
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:51,083
Shut down all systems!

564
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:07,750
(<i> voices speaking backwards</i> )

565
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:22,709
DATA:
I believe my
tricorder emissions

566
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,041
caused the temporal aperture
to activate.

567
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,000
I suggest we avoid
exposing it

568
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,792
to any further
energy emissions.

569
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:30,583
When time resumed

570
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:33,125
did you observe any activity
in the Engine Room

571
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,083
that might suggest
what the Romulans were doing?

572
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,709
They may have been attempting
to eject their engine core.

573
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,375
I thought I heard
one of the engineers

574
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:41,166
say something about
a power transfer--

575
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,041
something about
an energy feedback.

576
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,333
Yes, Captain.

577
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,083
It looks to me like they
were trying to stop

578
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,041
whatever was happening here.

579
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,291
Mr. La Forge

580
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,750
from where you are,
can you determine

581
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,583
what is happening
on the Romulan Bridge?

582
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,417
I think so, Captain.

583
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,041
Wait.

584
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:04,500
Something's not right here.

585
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:07,959
Data, was this man always
standing right here?

586
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,417
(<i> gasping</i> )

587
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,959
(<i> moaning</i> )

588
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:16,834
He's in neural shock.

589
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,166
We must get him
to the runabout.

590
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,709
There isn't time.

591
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,208
He's dying.

592
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,417
At least this way

593
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,000
he'll be alive in
the other time frame.

594
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:28,625
We might have a chance
to save him later.

595
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:33,875
Is the Romulan still alive?

596
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:36,083
Yes, but...

597
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,083
I am getting
unusual readings

598
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,166
from his bio-scan.

599
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,250
I am not certain
he is a Romulan.

600
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:00,458
His cellular structure
does not conform

601
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,875
to any known species.

602
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:04,625
His bioelectric patterns

603
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,917
are in a state
of temporal flux.

604
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,458
I do not believe
this being

605
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,041
is native to our
time continuum.

606
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:12,250
Mr. Data, you said that
you found organic matter

607
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,458
in the temporal aperture.

608
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,208
Correct, sir.

609
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,333
I'd like to take a closer
look at those readings.

610
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,208
This is a biospectral analysis

611
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,959
of the temporal aperture.

612
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,667
The organic readings

613
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,917
originated
from these dark spots.

614
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,875
They appear to contain
some sort of energy patterns.

615
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,834
Can you isolate one of them

616
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,500
and magnify?

617
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,625
They look like...
cellular clusters.

618
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,500
DATA:
Its bioelectric patterns

619
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:48,208
are similar to those
of the alien's.

620
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,000
However, they are
significantly less complex.

621
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:53,125
Its cellular structure

622
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,208
appears to be in
a state of mitosis.

623
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,667
Data, this could be
some sort of embryo.

624
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:00,125
It is possible.

625
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:01,917
If I could further scan
the aperture

626
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:04,417
it might be possible to...

627
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:05,542
(<i> alien groaning</i> )

628
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:06,959
TROI:
Captain.

629
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:13,875

Must... save...

630
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:15,458
No...

631
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,834
Who are you?

632
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:20,083
This body is not mine.

633
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,625
It was necessary to assume it

634
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,750
to exist in your time.

635
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,333
Why are you here?

636
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:29,458
We had to come... to save them.

637
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,208
They were in danger.

638
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,125
Who were
in danger?

639
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,041
Our young.

640
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:38,166
They will die
in the gravity well.

641
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,083
It is artificial.

642
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,333
Artificial gravity well?

643
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,917
Do you mean
the Romulan engine core?

644
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,250
Yes.

645
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,166
Our young are trapped.

646
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:51,125
We must get them out.

647
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:52,834
Return them
to our time.

648
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,500
His molecular structure

649
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,000
is destabilizing.

650
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:02,125
How were your young
trapped in the core?

651
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:05,542
We must use
a natural gravity well

652
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,959
to incubate our young.

653
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,959
We thought the Romulan core
would suffice.

654
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,959
It did not.

655
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,375
DATA:
Captain, I believe the aliens

656
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:17,208
mistook
the artificial singularity

657
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,959
which the Romulans use
in their engine

658
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,542
for a natural one,
a black hole.

659
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,792
They tried to use it as a nest.

660
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:26,625
That's what deactivated
the warbird's engine core

661
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,959
so the Romulans sent out
a distress call.

662
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,542
PICARD:
The<i> Enterprise</i> responded

663
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:35,083
and found the warbird suffering
from an apparent engine failure

664
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,250
and they attempted
a power transfer.

665
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,166
ALIEN:
Power transfer.

666
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:41,667
We must stop power transfer.

667
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:43,291
Ruptured time...

668
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,125
destroy our young...

669
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,291
When the power transfer
came into contact

670
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,125
with the alien nest

671
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,959
I believe it disrupted

672
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,834
the space-time
continuum.

673
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,625
Did you attack the<i> Enterprise?</i>

674
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,125
Yes.

675
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:59,125
Had to stop power transfer.

676
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,750
Are there any others
like you here?

677
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:07,458
One... one other.

678
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,792
Do you know where he is?

679
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,542
Could he help us
restore normal time?

680
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,000
I estimate the core breach
will consume the<i> Enterprise</i>

681
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:47,250
in approximately seven hours,
two minutes.

682
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,625
Is it possible to lock
onto the core itself--

683
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,458
beam it into space?

684
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,792
No, sir.

685
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:56,417
We would have
to surround the core

686
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:58,375
with a subspace isolation field.

687
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:01,333
It is not possible to generate
a field of that magnitude

688
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,959
from the runabout.

689
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,417
Mr. Data...

690
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:14,250
When you scanned the temporal
aperture with your tricorder

691
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:18,041
it caused time to move forwards
and then back again.

692
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,166
Correct, sir.

693
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:20,417
What if we could

694
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,625
reverse that process?

695
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,542
Cause time to move backwards
and then forwards.

696
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:29,208
We might be able to run
time back to a point

697
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,959
before the warp core
breach occurred

698
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,667
and then find a way

699
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,000
to prevent
the power transfer.

700
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:37,417
And then, when time
goes forward again...

701
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:38,709
the breach never happens.

702
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,750
DATA:
I could attempt
to remodulate

703
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,709
the tricorder's
delta-band emissions.

704
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,709
It should be possible
to better control

705
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,750
the temporal
aperture.

706
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:46,834
Make it so.

707
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:55,458
If this works, we may
not have much time

708
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,959
to prevent the
power transfer.

709
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,625
We'll have to decide

710
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,208
precisely where to
be and what to do

711
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,834
the very instant that time
begins to move backwards.

Counselor, are you in position?

720
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:23,750
Ready, Captain.

721
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:26,458
All right, Mr. Data.

722
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,375
Initiating tricorder emissions.

723
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:31,625
(<i> beeping</i> )

724
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,583
(<i> voices speaking backwards</i> )

725
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,041
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

726
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,125
Captain...

727
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:52,458
PICARD:
Go ahead, Mr. Data.

728
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,041
The warp core breach
has been reversed, sir.

729
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,792
Be ready to stop
the power transfer, Mr. Data.

730
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:00,250
Aye, sir.

731
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,417
You must stop!

732
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:19,250
COMPUTER:
Specified energy systems

733
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,709
have been initialized.

734
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,917
The power transfer
can now be engaged.

735
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,041
Do not initiate
that power transfer.

736
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:29,458
I'm sorry, sir.
I already have.

737
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,875
We must shut it down.

738
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:34,542
The transfer beam
is at saturation, sir.

739
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,750
It can't be disengaged.

740
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:39,583
Computer, place a level-three
containment field

741
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,375
around the warp core.

742
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,625
Containment field activated.

743
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,166
(<i> yelling</i> )

744
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,250
RIKER:
Damage report.

745
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:49,709
MAN:
Shields down to 27%.

746
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:53,792
Oh!

747
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:56,083
MAN:
Primary phaser array...

748
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:57,375
Captain?

749
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,959
No time to explain,
Number One.

750
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:00,750
Continue the evacuation
of the Romulan ship.

751
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:02,917
You'll find La Forge
in the Romulan Engine Room.

752
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,583
Beam him directly to Sick Bay.

753
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:07,834
Step back, now.

754
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:09,375
CRUSHER:
It's all right, Deanna.

755
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,709
He wasn't firing at me.

756
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,291
ROMULAN:
There was an alien here

757
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,291
who'd taken Romulan form.

758
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,625
I was firing at her.

759
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,959
The doctor
got in the way.

760
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,917
Where did she go?

761
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,667
PICARD:
Status, Mr. Data.

762
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,250
I was attacked
by another alien, sir.

763
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:31,959
I was unable to prevent
the power transfer.

764
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,959
It cannot be disengaged, sir.

765
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,542
A core breach is again imminent.

766
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:37,083
Can we move
the ship?

767
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:42,417
The feedback
from the transfer beam

768
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:44,917
would tear us apart.

769
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,500
Patch me into the
navigational control

770
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,834
of the runabout.

771
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:52,041
Got it.

772
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:57,709
I'm bringing the runabout in.

773
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:10,500
PICARD:
Mr. Data?

774
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:13,750
The core breach
has been prevented, sir.

775
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:19,417
Data, it appears that
severing the power transfer

776
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:21,041
has not only prevented
the core breach

777
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,667
but it has also

778
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:24,792
restored space-time to normal.

779
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:27,333
The alien who attacked me
has vanished, sir.

780
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,834
PICARD:
The warbird
has vanished as well.

781
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:32,792
Judging from the residual
temporal fluctuations

782
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:36,000
I believe they have returned
to their own time continuum.

783
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:37,709
Captain?

784
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

785
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,542
It's going to take

786
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:47,208
a little time to
explain, Number One.

787
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,625
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46945.3.</i>

788
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:54,875
<i>We successfully evacuated</i>
<i>the crew of the Romulan ship</i>

789
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:57,417
<i>and we're on course</i>

790
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:00,125

791
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,500
(<i> door chimes</i> )

792
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:03,166
Come in.

793
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:13,041
Where's that cat of yours?

794
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:14,542
Spot is sleeping, sir.

795
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,166
Why do you ask?

796
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,792
No reason.

797
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:22,917
I've worked out the
new rotation schedules.

798
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:25,250
I'd like you to cross-check
the personnel assignments.

799
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:26,709
Notify the department heads.

800
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,417
Your Bridge shift
begins at 2300 hours.

801
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,500
Understood, sir.

802
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:34,709
What are you doing?

803
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,041
Recent events
have compelled me to study

804
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:40,583
how humans perceive
the passage of time.

805
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:43,625
For example, I have often
heard people comment

806
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:46,208
that time seems to pass
more slowly in one instance

807
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,375
or more quickly in another.

808
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:51,083
In reality,
the actual passage of time

809
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:52,291
remains fixed.

810
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,583
Hmm.

811
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:58,417
I suppose it depends on
how people perceive time.

812
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:01,375
Every situation's different.

813
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:04,250
It depends on how you feel.

814
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:08,542
I have been testing the aphorism
"a watched pot never boils."

815
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:11,125
I have boiled
the same amount of water

816
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:13,083
in this kettle 62 times.

817
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:15,417
In some cases,
I have ignored the kettle.

818
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,917
In others,
I have watched it intently.

819
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,417
In every instance

820
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,458
the water reaches
its boiling point

821
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,750
in precisely 51.7 seconds.

822
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:27,166
It appears I am not capable
of perceiving time

823
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:30,208
any differently
than my internal chronometer.

824
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,375
Well, why don't you turn it off?

825
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:34,375
Sir?

826
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:36,500
Data, people do not have
internal chronometers.

827
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:39,000
Why don't you see what happens
if you turn yours off?

828
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:41,750
Thank you, sir.

829
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:43,166
I will try that.

830
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,542
Just don't be late
for your shift.

831
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,625
(<i> kettle whistling</i> )
