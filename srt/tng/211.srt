00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:06,041
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate 42609.1.</i>

2
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:09,000
<i>In response to a desperate</i>
<i>plea from my old friend</i>

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,917
<i>Captain Donald Varley</i>
<i>of the USS Yamato,</i>

4
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:15,000
<i>I am running a grave risk</i>
<i>by taking the</i> Enterprise

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,917
<i>into the neutral zone.</i>

6
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,667
<i>Varley's request was prompted</i>
<i>by dangerous malfunctions</i>

7
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:21,625
<i>which have been plaguing</i>
<i>our sister ship.</i>

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,500
<i>Perhaps with both crews</i>
<i>working together,</i>

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,792
<i>we can eliminate</i>
<i>the problems</i>

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,959
<i>before our presence is</i>
<i>detected by the Romulans.</i>

11
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,041
How long to rendezvous,
Mr. Crusher?

12
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,041
Four minutes
and 33 seconds, sir.

13
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,208
Status of download,
Mr. Data?

14
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:43,166
The<i> Yamato</i> log should be in our
computer by rendezvous, sir.

15
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,417
Have you nailed down
our little hiccup yet?

16
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,417
Sir?
The odd reading?

17
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:49,417
No, sir. It might be
due to problems

18
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,625
currently being
experienced by the<i> Yamato.</i>

19
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:56,166
Trouble,
number one?

20
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,625
I'm not sure, sir.
Are we alone out here, Worf?

21
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,875
Yes sir, there are
no other vessels in the area

22
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,208
except the<i> Yamato.</i>

23
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,458
Which is coming into
visual range now.

24
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,291
At last.

25
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:10,709
WORF:
Transmission from
the<i> Yamato,</i> sir.

26
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,333
On viewer.

27
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,333
Donald?

28
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,291
What's a nice Starfleet
captain like you doing

29
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,500
doing in a place
like this?

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,667
It's good to see you
again, Jean-Luc.

31
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,208
Despite your
antique humor.

32
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:27,083
I only hope your people
are able to help us.

33
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:31,417
The malfunctions are
becoming serious.

34
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:33,625
We lost an engineering team

35
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,917
when the computer
shut down a forcefield

36
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,875
in an open shuttle bay.

37
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,834
18 people.

38
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,625
Do you have any idea
what caused this, sir?

39
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,750
None. They're affecting
every system simultaneously.

40
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,875
It's like the ship has suddenly
decided to fall apart.

41
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,333
It's beginning
to make me think that

42
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,166
we should've run these
galaxy class ships

43
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:57,083
across a few more drawing boards
before building one.

44
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,417
You believe
it's a design flaw?

45
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:00,917
I don't know.

46
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:02,875
I'm grasping
at straws here.

47
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,667
All I know is
we've got to get it fixed

48
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,542
before I lose more than
an engineering team.

49
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:10,375
Do you wish to evacuate
any non-essential personnel

50
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,542
to the<i> Enterprise,</i> sir?

51
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:14,917
No. No that would be
premature.

52
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:18,166
Donald, we'll get our teams
to work on it immediately.

53
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,375
I'm sure neither of us
feels too comfortable

54
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,208
sitting around in
the neutral zone.

55
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,583
I know what
you're thinking--

56
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,208
what the hell am I
doing here?

57
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,500
Well I heard a...

58
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,083
few rumors about a couple
of archaeological digs

59
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,959
that started
making the Iconians

60
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,000
sound a lot less
like legend.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,750
I did a little
investigating,

62
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,959
and I located
their home world.

63
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,917
In the neutral zone?

64
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:43,750
In the neutral zone.

65
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,125
Donald, that was
quite a risk to run

66
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,083
to satisfy archaeological
curiosity.

67
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:53,583
The risk would be in allowing
the Romulans to locate Iconia.

68
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,667
(<i> static</i> )

69
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:59,834
--fortunately,
I got there first.

70
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:02,083
It's a virtually
dead planet,

71
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,417
but enough
technology remains

72
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,834
to give the Romulans an edge
if they should find it.

73
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,625
(<i> static</i> )

74
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,250
Donald, your transmission
is breaking up.

75
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,166
Mr. Data,
try and clean that up.

76
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,208
Sir, there is
an energy build-up

77
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,625
in the<i> Yamato's</i>
engineering section.

78
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,959
<i>Yamato,</i> this is
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

79
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,667
<i>Yamato,</i> come in.

80
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:30,542
Captain, magnetic seals in the
antimatter chamber are decaying.

81
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:32,750
Captain...

82
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,625
Donald, come in!

83
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,166
Shields up.

84
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,834
Sir.

85
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,500
DATA:
Sensors indicate...

86
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,125
no life reading, sir.

87
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,000
WORF: Captain,
another vessel

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,875
is coming within
sensor range.

89
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,625
It is Romulan.

90
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:33,917
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

91
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:38,125
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

92
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,583
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

93
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:44,000
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,208
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

95
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:52,208
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

96
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,250
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

97
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,291
<i>The</i> Yamato's<i> entire crew</i>
<i>and their families,</i>

98
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,250
<i>more than a thousand people,</i>
<i>have been lost.</i>

99
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,208
<i>Circumstances</i>
<i>unfortunately</i>

100
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,667
<i>permit us</i>
<i>no pause for grief.</i>

101
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,125
No response from
the Romulan vessel.

102
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,125
Arm phasers and prepare
to lock on target.

103
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,250
Did they attack
the<i> Yamato?</i>

104
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,583
Unknown, sir.

105
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,542
All their weapons systems
have been fully activated.

106
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:17,208
Still no response.

107
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,834
Romulan vessel, this is
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

108
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,875
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

109
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,583
Captain Picard.

110
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,834
Explain your illegal presence
in the Neutral Zone.

111
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:34,083
Explain yours.

112
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,500
Are you responsible for the
destruction of the<i> Yamato</i> ?

113
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,208
No, but believe me,
Captain,

114
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,500
had we chosen
to exercise our right

115
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,083
to defend
the Neutral Zone,

116
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,125
we would not have stopped
with one starship.

117
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,208
You will leave at once.

118
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:56,792
Comments?

119
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,667
She's extremely
anxious.

120
00:06:58,667 --> 00:06:59,834
Understandable if she just

121
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,583
destroyed a federation starship.

122
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,125
Your scan was
inconclusive,

123
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,875
we don't know what
happened to the<i> Yamato.</i>

124
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,542
Our presence
in the Neutral Zone
is provocative.

125
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,834
It could force her
to respond.

126
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,208
Open.

127
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,667
We will comply

128
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:23,041
when I have determined the cause
of the destruction of the<i> Yamato</i>

129
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,583
and when I am fully satisfied
that you are not responsible.

130
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,875
Picard out.

131
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,917
They're engaging
their cloaking device.

132
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,625
Good. They can't fire
when they're cloaked.

133
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,583
Unless they have overcome
that deficiency.

134
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,542
The<i> Yamato</i> was destroyed
while they were cloaked.

135
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,667
Enough.
Answers.

136
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:43,917
I want answers,
not conjecture

137
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,166
Number one,
I want them

138
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,000
at a staff meeting
in one hour.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,458
RIKER:
Aye, sir.

140
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,458
Sensor recordings reveal
that what we witnessed

141
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,792
was an uncontrolled

142
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:00,041
and catastrophic
matter/antimatter mix.

143
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,750
The magnetic seals between
the chambers collapsed and...

144
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,375
PICARD:
Wait...wait.

145
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,375
That's not possible.

146
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,750
Yes sir, it is, but a highly
improbable set of circumstances

147
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,542
has to take place for
such a result to occur.

148
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:15,500
Explain.

149
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,208
Okay. In the event of
a breach of seal integrity,

150
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,917
there's an emergency
release system

151
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,542
which dumps
the antimatter.

152
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:26,625
Apparently
such a dump began,
was then halted,

153
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,583
and the containment
seals were dropped.

154
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,250
There was still sufficient
antimatter present to lead

155
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,583
to an explosion.

156
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,166
And so there is
no evidence

157
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,583
that a weapon was used?

158
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,500
No, sir, none.

159
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,083
However it happened,

160
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,875
the<i> Yamato</i> did it
to herself.

161
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,291
Theorize.

162
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:47,041
What could have caused
such a catastrophic malfunction?

163
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,875
Well, I think Captain Varley
may have been right.

164
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,250
There may be
a design flaw.

165
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,333
In a galaxy class
starship?
Yes, sir.

166
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,291
It's the most sophisticated
piece of machinery ever built.

167
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,125
Something could have
been overlooked.

168
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,417
Knowing where
the flaw is located,

169
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,250
can you isolate the problem
and solve it?

170
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,625
We're already
working on it, sir.

171
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,875
Pull any personnel
you can use.

172
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,750
If we have established
that the Romulans were

173
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,750
not responsible for
the destruction of the<i> Yamato,</i>

174
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,709
would it not be
prudent to withdraw?

175
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,125
If it is a design flaw,

176
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,417
we're better
to stay where we are

177
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,750
and give Geordi time
to work on it,

178
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,291
or what happened to the<i> Yamato</i>
could happen to us.

179
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,417
Computer,

180
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:54,834
access Captain Donald Varley's
personal log.

181
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,500
Search parameter.

182
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,083
Locate entries
containing words

183
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,125
"Romulan" and-or "Iconian."

184
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,250
COMPUTER:
Working.

185
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,583
Personal log.

186
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,917
It was kind of Dr. Ramsey
to allow me to carry away

187
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,750
my own little piece
of legend

188
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,959
from the archaeological
dig on Denius 3.

189
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,917
My engineers have
examined it

190
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:24,500
but are completely baffled
by its technology.

191
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,417
What was its purpose?

192
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:32,500
I'm like a caveman
confronted by a tricorder.

193
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,709
I'm certain
this device is Iconian,

194
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,333
but how far had it traveled

195
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:41,291
before it was abandoned
on this alien world?

196
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,875
Personal log.

197
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,500
A galactic Rosetta Stone.

198
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,542
The starfields
on the artifact

199
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:52,333
were unintelligible
until I took into account

200
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,875
200 millennia
of stellar drift.

201
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,041
After that, it was easy
to pinpoint Iconia.

202
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,166
My first officer is
questioning the wisdom

203
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,583
of my order to violate
the Neutral Zone,

204
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,291
but I'm convinced that I've
taken the only proper course.

205
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,166
Should this
advanced technology

206
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,875
fall into the hands
of the Romulans,

207
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,250
we might as well
dock our ships

208
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,709
and defend ourselves
with sticks.

209
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,166
Personal log.

210
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,041
We've been spotted
by a Romulan cruiser.

211
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,542
But after playing
hide and seek

212
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,834
through several
solar systems,

213
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,417
I think I've managed
to elude them.

214
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,291
The Iconian probe scan--

215
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,667
was it an attempt at
communication?

216
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:42,166
If only I knew what
we were dealing with here.

217
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,083
Personal log.

218
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,458
I'm unable to send an away team
to the surface of Iconia,

219
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,667
nor can I scan the energy source
on the planet

220
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:55,583
because of these
maddening systems failures.

221
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,125
It's infuriating to be stopped
at the threshold of a dream

222
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,542
by one's own ship.

223
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:03,542
We're leaving orbit
to rendezvous with Picard.

224
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:06,625
If his people can't help us
repair the<i> Yamato,</i>

225
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,834
I must convince him

226
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:11,667
to continue
this exploration.

227
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,291
The future well-being
of the Federation

228
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,417
may well depend upon it.

229
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,917
COMPUTER:
No further entries

230
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:20,959
conforming to search
parameters.

231
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,333
Mr. Data,

232
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,375
there was a reference in
Captain Varley's personal log

233
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,000
to a probe that
scanned the<i> Yamato.</i>

234
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,250
Aye, sir. We have
a visual record.

235
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,500
Put it on main viewer.

236
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,250
What the devil is that?

237
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,917
Have you seen anything
like that before?

238
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,166
No, sir. It appears
to be a scanner,

239
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,875
possibly a transmitter.

240
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,834
Transmitting what?

241
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,792
Unknown, sir.

242
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:25,000
Engineering.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,542
La Forge.

244
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,959
PICARD:
What progress on
the matter/antimatter scan?

245
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,500
Everything continues
to check out.

246
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,291
I'm starting an analysis
on the magnetic coils.

247
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,291
When the<i> Yamato</i> was
probed, where was she?

248
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,583
In orbit
around a planet

249
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,041
at coordinates
227 mark 359, sir.

250
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,375
ETA at warp factor eight?

251
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,792
DATA:
12 hours,
16 minutes, sir.

252
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:52,458
Sir, that would put us
substantially close

253
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,875
to the Romulan side
at the Neutral Zone.

254
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,041
That can't be helped.

255
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,250
Ensign,
lay in a course.

256
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,250
Warp factor eight.

257
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,750
Aye, sir.

258
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,041
We're going to assume
the<i> Yamato's</i> mission.

259
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,625
And risk a war?

260
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,917
Perhaps... prevent one.

261
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,083
(<i> door chime</i> )
Come.

262
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,750
Sir, may I speak
with you a moment?

263
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,458
Yes, of course.

264
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,166
Well, what is it, Wesley?

265
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,250
It's about
the Iconians, sir.

266
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,166
I was told they were
just a myth.

267
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,000
China was thought
to be a myth

268
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,625
until Marco Polo
traveled there.

269
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,875
No, the Iconians are
certainly real.

270
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,625
Sit down.

271
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,291
We know that three systems
within this sector

272
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,208
had a number of cultural
similarities.

273
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,000
Similarities which
can only be explained

274
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,083
by there being a single
unifying influence.

275
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,041
So they colonized
those worlds?

276
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,458
Probably conquered.

277
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,667
You mean
they were warlike?

278
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,458
Perhaps.

279
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,542
Ancient texts did
speak of...

280
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,709
demons of air
and darkness.

281
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:15,542
Air and darkness?

282
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,208
Legend has it
that they...

283
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,417
traveled without
the benefit of spaceships.

284
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,250
Merely appearing
out of thin air

285
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,083
on distant planets.

286
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,625
Sounds like magic.

287
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:31,291
Well, we would appear magical
to Stone Age people.

288
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:34,875
How did you find
all this out?

289
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,083
Archaeology has been
a hobby of mine

290
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:42,375
since academy days,
but why don't we talk about

291
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,583
what really
brought you here?

292
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,500
It's the<i> Yamato,</i>
captain.

293
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,083
I can't stop
thinking about her.

294
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:58,625
All those people...

295
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,750
dead.

296
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,667
I don't know how
you and commander Riker

297
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:06,792
and Geordi,

298
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:09,500
how you handle it
so easily.

299
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,291
Easily?

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,625
Oh no, not easily.

301
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,667
We handle it because
we're trained to.

302
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,375
As you will be.

303
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,166
Tea. Earl gray. Hot.

304
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,375
But if ever
the time comes

305
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,834
when the death
of a single individual

306
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:32,250
fails to move us...

307
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,208
Didn't you order
tea, sir?

308
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,500
Now that should not
have happened.

309

<i>Captain's log,</i>

<i>the Enterprise is beginning</i>

La Forge.

318
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,500
Lieutenant,
are you making any progress

319
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,333
towards solving
our problems?

320
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,083
LA FORGE:
Solving them, no, sir,
but I can eliminate one worry.

321
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,125
It is not
a design flaw.

322
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,959
I've been reviewing
the<i> Yamato's</i> log.

323
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,709
And I think
that alien probe

324
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,208
may have had something to do
with their problems.

325
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,375
PICARD:
How?

326
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,208
I'd need to see
the thing.

327
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,750
If it was the probe,

328
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,333
that explains
the<i> Yamato.</i>

329
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,041
But how do you account
for the difficulties

330
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,041
the<i> Enterprise</i> is
experiencing?

331
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,792
I can't.

332
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,875
PICARD:
Lieutenant, are
our problems likely

333
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,500
to attain the seriousness
as those on the<i> Yamato?</i>

334
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,000
If you're asking
for speculation, I'd say

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
yes, sir, they are.
I need time.

336
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,750
Mr. La Forge,
time is one thing

337
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,166
we do not have
in abundance.

338
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,875
PICARD:
Analysis, Mr. Data?

339
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,750
Scanning, sir.

340
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,417
Well, Mr. Data?

341
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,667
No life-form readings, sir.

342
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,959
All major cities have
been heavily damaged.

343
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,291
And the pattern
of destruction

344
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,917
is that consistent
with large-scale

345
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,375
orbital
bombardment.

346
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,208
How long ago?

347
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,291
Approximately
200,000 years, sir.

348
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,667
There is an energy source

349
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,917
in the mountains
of the smaller continent.

350
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:30,542
PICARD:
Magnify.

351
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,375
Is that Iconia?

352
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,542
Captain Varley died
believing that it was.

353
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,709

Did you see that?

354
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:45,792

from the planet's surface.

355
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,625
Its size and composition

356
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,667
match the probe which

357
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:51,000
scanned the<i> Yamato,</i> sir.

358
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,208
Shields up.

359
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,834
Prepare a tractor beam.

360
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:58,000
Mr. La Forge, I'm going
to assist you in your research.

361
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,583
A probe has been launched
from Iconia.

362
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,834
I'm going
to capture it.

363
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,542
No, sir, wait!

364
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:09,250
Captain! Captain!

365
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,250
Coming through!

366
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,959
Bridge.

367
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,834
(<i> grunting</i> )

368
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,667
Emergency stop!

369
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:36,667
(<i> grunting</i> )

370
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,250
Stop it, damn it!

371
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,083
Tractor beam ready, sir.

372
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,750
Geordi,
are you all right?

373
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,208
Destroy the probe sir,
quickly.

374
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,834
Worf, target phasers.

375
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,291
Phasers locked
on target.

376
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,625
Fire.

377
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,792
(<i> sighs</i> )

378
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:31,458
welcome to the bridge,
Mr. La Forge.

379
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,375
Thank you, sir.

380
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,333
If that thing had
managed to scan us,

381
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,375
we never would've had
any chance of saving
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

382
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,458
That probe was
a transmitter

383
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,583
sending an alien
computer program,

384
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,000
the same program that is
currently aboard the<i> Enterprise</i>

385
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,625
trying to rewrite our software
in its own image.

386
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,792
We have two completely
incompatible computer systems

387
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,417
trying to interact.

388
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:57,792
So that's why
the ship's instruments

389
00:20:57,792 --> 00:20:58,792
have become so erratic.

390
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,291
Yes.
What can you do?

391
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,709
Not very much.

392
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:04,041
The Iconian program is
so sophisticated

393
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,458
I may never
understand it.

394
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,000
Consider, Captain,
this program has

395
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,667
entered an alien database,

396
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,166
ours, and in
less than seven hours

397
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,166
has managed to not only
learn our systems

398
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,792
but has begun
to reprogram our computer.

399
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,250
And so the earlier probe

400
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,959
was responsible for
the<i> Yamato's</i> destruction?

401
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:23,458
Yes, but only inasmuch as
it was the probe that

402
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,458
transmitted the program.

403
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,291
But we weren't scanned
by that probe.

404
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,625
Then how did this thing get
aboard the<i> Enterprise?</i>

405
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,500
DATA:
We downloaded
the<i> Yamato</i> log.

406
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,417
And contained in the log was
the program.

407
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,792
Why didn't we suffer
the same fate?

408
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,792
The program affected
all of the<i> Yamato's</i>

409
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,250
systems simultaneously.

410
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,875
But with us,
it was deposited within

411
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,709
a specific section
of our mainframe.

412
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:46,375
So it's having to work its way
out from that location.

413
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,709
That gives us
a little breathing space.

414
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:51,000
Not much.

415
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,083
The injury reports are
increasing, too, sir.

416
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,417
Dr. Pulaski is unwilling
to trust the turbolifts.

417
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:02,000
She is sending medical teams
through the access tunnels.

418
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,959
Captain--
the<i> Enterprise</i>
computer system

419
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,375
is a lot like
our own bodies,

420
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,041
with voluntary
and involuntary systems.

421
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,417
Now, probably 90% of
what goes on in this ship

422
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:13,583
is done automatically,

423
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,375
completely
out of our control.

424
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,000
We're sitting on a bomb
that could go off

425
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
any second
or maybe never.

426
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,792
The biobeds aren't
working.

427
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,750
The ship is falling apart.

428
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,834
I've had 35 emergency calls
scattered across 12 decks.

429
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:44,125
My trauma teams are being
run ragged trying to respond.

430
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,750
Biobeds!

431
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,875
Dr. Pulaski.
Yes?

432
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,375
I've got a problem here.

433
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,208
The knitter
isn't working.

434
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,166
Oh, try a splint.

435
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,417
Doctor?

436
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,375
Splint, it's a very
ancient concept.

437
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,875
You take two flat pieces
of wood or plastic, a bandage.

438
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,542
The broken limb is
kept immobile.

439
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:05,125
That's crazy, that's
not practicing medicine.

440
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,125
Oh yes, it is,
it's a time-honored way

441
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,208
to practice medicine
with your head and your heart

442
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:12,000
and your hands,
so jump to it.

443
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,834
Damn.

444
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:19,625
Try a bypass on the shield
control interface.

445
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,250
No, no go.

446
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,417
Let me see if I can directly
access the master program.

447
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,250
Data.
Yes?

448
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,834
What happened?

449
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:36,959
Any answer would be
mere speculation.

450
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,333
This is yet another example

451
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,959
of how our actions
have random results.

452
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,291
Thanks, Data.

453
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,166
I noticed.

454
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:47,333
Life support has failed
on decks 7 and 13, sir.

455
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,959
Now what if this thing manages
to rewrite our entire system?

456
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,583
It's so far beyond us,
we have no hope of

457
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,417
ever understanding it,
let alone controlling it.

458
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:58,166
Our own ignorance
could kill us.

459
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,458
We may never...

460
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,208
we may never
reach that point.

461
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,417
A variation of what
happened to the<i> Yamato</i>

462
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:05,834
might destroy us first.

463
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:07,417
So we just sit here
and watch our ship

464
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:09,041
disintegrate
around us?

465
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:12,834
The probe was
launched from Iconia...

466
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:15,750
probably from
an automated system.

467
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,333
There may be records
near the launch site

468
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,917
that could help us
find a solution.

469
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,458
I'll arrange
an away team.

470
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,333
And I'll lead it.

471
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,166
You will lead it?

472
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,583
Yes.

473
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:35,041
Sir, we've had this
conversation 100 times.

474
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,709
And we will have it
again, number one.

475
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,709
I have been studying
the Iconians since I was
a cadet.

476
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:41,125
I have to be
the one to go.

477
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,291
The<i> Enterprise</i>
is yours.

478
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,834
For as long as she lasts.

479
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,375
O'BRIEN:
I've got a lock
on the energy source,

480
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,333
and, for the moment,
this baby's working.

481
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,166
That could change
in an instant.

482
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,750
PICARD:
We are aware of the risks.

483
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,792
Energize.

484
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,667
Transport complete.

485
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,750
Stay sharp,
Mr. O'Brien.

486
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,917
I want to be able
to pull them out of there
at a moment's notice.

487
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:19,208
O'BRIEN:
Aye, sir.

488
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,125
Commander,
Romulan vessel.

489
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,792
RIKER:
Open hailing
frequencies.

490
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:25,792
They're arming
photon torpedoes.

491
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,375
Shields up.
Go to red alert.

492
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,041
Sir, the shields aren't
responding.

493
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,625
They're preparing
to fire photon torpedoes.

494
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:35,083
Mr. Crusher,
I need those shields.

495
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,709
I'm trying, sir.

496
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,041
They're firing.

497
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,250
What happened?

498
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,750
Instead of firing,

499
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,583
they suddenly disarmed
and cancelled.

500
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,250
Fate.

501
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:00,083
Protects fools,
little children,

502
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,834
and ships named
<i>Enterprise.</i>

503
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,667
Lock phasers on the Romulans
and hold your fire.

504
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,542
Sir, the shields
are back up.

505
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:14,125
Impeccable timing.

506
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,500
Sir, the shields
are back down.

507
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,667
Phaser banks are down.

508
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,583
Shields are back up.

509
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:22,667
In another time and place,
this could be funny.

510
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:24,875
Status of torpedo banks?

511
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,208
They're down, too.

512
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,166
If it should become
necessary to fight,

513
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,792
could you arrange to find me
some rocks to throw at them?

514
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:36,875
Sir, the Romulan torpedoes are
continuing to arm and disarm.

515
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,834
Perhaps its attempt to fire
was unintentional.

516
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,333
Open hailing frequencies.

517
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,125
Open.

518
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,500
Romulan vessel,
this is Commander William Riker,

519
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,625
first officer
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

520
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:51,500
Why did you attempt
to fire on us?

521
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,291
This is Subcommander Taris
of the<i> Haakona.</i>

522
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:57,750
Why have you penetrated deeper
into the neutral zone?

523
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,709
Why are you still here?

524
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:03,166
I have claimed this planet
for the Romulan Empire.

525
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,542
This is
the Neutral Zone.

526
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,875
No one can claim anything.

527
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,750
You will withdraw,

528
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,208
or I will be forced to destroy
your ship and your away team.

529
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,500
What the hell?

530
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,458
This is your final warning.
I will not...

531
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,917
Having a little trouble
with your systems, Commander?

532
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:31,792
Maybe we should consider
postponing the war.

533
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:36,166
Until we solve our
more immediate problem.

534
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,417
You're stalling
for time.

535
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,417
Sir, another probe
launched for the planet.

536
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:41,667
Heading toward
the Romulans.

537
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,250
Have we got
our phasers back?

538
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,959
No, sir.

539
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:47,166
Taris, if you have
phaser capability,

540
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,458
prepare to
use them now.

541
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,750
What?

542
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,709
Destroy that probe.

543
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,375
Not even a thank you.

544
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,834
Subcommander Taris is
deeply frustrated,

545
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:11,667
probably because her ship is
as crippled as the<i> Enterprise.</i>

546
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:14,375
Why would the Romulans be
experiencing problems?

547
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,667
They weren't probed.

548
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:17,959
They must have tapped
into the<i> Yamato</i> log.

549
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:24,000
Taris got a whole lot more
than she bargained for.

550
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:26,625
RIKER:
Maintain red alert

551
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,750
and try to keep
those shields up in case

552
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,917
Taris decides to act
on her threat.

553
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:33,291
Commander.

554
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,041
What about the away team?

555
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,667
With the shields up,
we can't beam them back.

556
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,375
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

557
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:50,208
<i>While there is little left</i>
<i>on the surface of Iconia,</i>

558
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,792
<i>we have found what</i>
<i>appears to be a control center</i>

559
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:55,792
<i>which seems to have</i>
<i>remained intact.</i>

560
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,792
WORF:
Come in,<i> Enterprise.</i>

561
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,250
Still no response, sir.

562
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,500
Keep trying them.

563
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,834
Communications are
bound to be erratic.

564
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:10,917
I would not like
to become

565
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,083
a permanent resident
of this planet.

566
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:16,792
Nor would I,
Mr. Worf.

567
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:25,125
Scanners show no other
life-forms on the planet, sir.

568
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,750
I would not expect any.

569
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,917
Judging from the severity
of the bombardment,

570
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:33,917
I doubt
any Iconians survived.

571
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,333
Well...

572
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:39,750
Mr. Data, let's see what sense
we can make of this.

573
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,583
Aye, sir.

574
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:44,417
This is very reminiscent
of Dinasian.

575
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:45,834
Yes, sir.

576
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:49,875
There are also similarities
to Dewan and Iccobar.

577
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,542
Is it possible they
could be branches

578
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,959
of the same language family,
beginning with Iconian?

579
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,542
It is, sir.

580
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,458
Run a comparison
using basic simple words

581
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,834
from Dinasian, Dewan,
and Iccobar.

582
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:05,709
Let's see if we can reconstruct
a common root language.

583
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:07,542
Accessing, sir.

584
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:20,792
You're jumpy.

585
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,500
The tension on the ship
is very high.

586
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
What's your
recommendation?

587
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,125
Give everyone
something to do,

588
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,208
somewhere to focus
their attention.

589
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,542
All right.

590
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,583
Let's consider
evacuation.

591
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,458
To the planet?

592
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:48,458
I know it's probably impossible
with Taris sitting out there...

593
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:53,083
but it would give
everyone something to do.

594
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,625
You go and organize it.

595
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,917
But you might need me
if you have to negotiate

596
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:58,250
with Taris again.

597
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,375
I'll manage.

598
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,959
Right now,
they're more important.

599
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,750
DATA:
Captain.

600
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,000
Your original hypothesis
is correct.

601
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,500
Iconian is the parent tongue
of a language family

602
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,375
which consists of Iccobar,
Dewan, and Dinasian.

603
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,125
I've constructed a basic
working understanding

604
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,041
through a comparison
of common root words

605
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:34,250
such as mother, father,
child, home, tribe,

606
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,542
food, life, death,
yours, ours, mine...

607
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:38,709
Data, Data, Data.

608
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:40,458
You do understand, sir,
that my interpretation

609
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,625
of the symbols
will not be exact?

610
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,500
Yes, let's
get on with it.

611
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,125
This would appear to be
manual override.

612
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,041
That was not
manual override.

613
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:07,125
Demons of air
and darkness, indeed.

614
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,208
What is that?

615
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:13,625
A gateway.

616
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:17,375
These scenes could be
holographic images.

617
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,875
PICARD:
Be careful.

618
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,750
Data!

619
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,333
That was
very foolish.

620
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,959
But we have established
that this is not a holograph.

621
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,667
If I step through
and investigate,

622
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:32,792
we could determine whether
this is truly a gateway.

623
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,291
No, Data. You might not
be able to get back,

624
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,083
and I can't
risk losing you.

625
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:40,166
If it is not illusion,
this gate would seem to take us

626
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,166
beyond the confines
of this planet.

627
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:45,000
Is this how
the Iconians traveled?

628
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,709
Crossing light-years

629
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:49,125
as easily as
we would cross a room?

630
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,917
Those places
could be on worlds

631
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:53,250
in distant corners
of the galaxy.

632
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,875
I think the Iconians might
have outfoxed their enemies.

633
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,667
Maybe they didn't all die
in the bombardment.

634
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:04,625
Some of them could have
passed through this.

635
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,959
This is what
Varley feared.

636
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,959
This is what
he died for.

637
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,000
Sir?

638
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,750
The Romulans could use

639
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,041
this technology
as a weapon.

640
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,834
Like the Iconians did.

641
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:18,166
No, I disagree.

642
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:20,125
Captain, there is
nothing in this room

643
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:23,375
to indicate it was used
as a military command center.

644
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,583
Perhaps
a transporter room.

645
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,834
But the probe was
hostile.

646
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,667
We can't make
that assumption.

647
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,458
The effect on the<i> Yamato</i>
was devastating.

648
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:35,792
But what if it was
by accident, not design?

649
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:39,333
What I'm going to say
may sound unscientific,

650
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:43,291
but standing on this soil,
breathing in this air,

651
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:46,041
my instincts tell me that
we may have got them wrong.

652
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:48,875
But we do know
the Iconians were conquerors.

653
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,750
But that knowledge
was passed down

654
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,959
by the descendants of those
who attacked this world.

655
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:55,542
The victors invariably
write the history

656
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:57,083
to their own
advantage.

657
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,917
There is an unfortunate
tendency in many cultures

658
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:03,291
to fear what they
do not understand.

659
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,667
It's possible
that their enemies,

660
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,041
confronted by
this technology,

661
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,834
were driven to attack
the Iconians out of fear.

662
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:13,792
Sir.

663
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:23,000
Was that really
the<i> Enterprise?</i>

664
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,458
I believe that
it was.

665
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:29,250
Gentlemen,
we have a way home.

666
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,000
Captain, there's a vast
underground power source

667
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,709
which is controlled
by this console.

668
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:38,333
I believe my triggering
of the gateway

669
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,083
has caused a dramatic
upsurge in the power level.

670
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:45,125
Ah, I have access.

671
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,208
(<i> high-pitched tone</i> )

672
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,709
PICARD:
Data, can you hear me?

673
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:09,000
Data, respond.

674
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,166
Captain...

675
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,959
Are you all right?

676
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:15,959
No... I am damaged.

677
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:17,583
How bad is it?

678
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,667
The Iconian program

679
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:22,166
is attempting to rewrite
my software.

680
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,125
Physical
manifestations--

681
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,125
blindness, motor con...

682
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,208
Sir.

683
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:30,375
Without him,
we have no hope

684
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,375
of deciphering
the program.

685
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,792
Captain,
the<i> Enterprise</i> again.

686
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,917
How long is
the interval?

687
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:46,458
About four minutes,
if the cycle holds.

688
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,417
The next time
the<i> Enterprise</i> appears,

689
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:50,041
go through it
with Data.

690
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,667
Geordi will be able
to learn from him,

691
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:52,750
maybe help him.

692
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,458
Sir, we have not
yet established

693
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:56,959
that<i> that</i> is
truly a gateway.

694
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,458
This will be
the test.

695
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,375
Aye, sir.

696
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:06,291
Destroy the tricorder.

697
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,792
Sir, it contains
everything

698
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:09,375
we've discovered
up to this point.

699
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,250
And that is precisely
why it must be destroyed.

700
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,083
PICARD:
How long?

701
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,875
About three minutes.

702
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:22,166
I'm running out of time.

703
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:24,000
We all are.

704
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,250
Data.

705
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,125
Data...

706
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:29,417
I have to destroy this.

707
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,583
This control room
and its technology

708
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:33,583
must not be allowed to fall
into Romulan hands.

709
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:35,834
DATA:
I understand, sir.

710
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:38,041
How?
How do I do it?

711
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,458
How do I destroy
everything?

712
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,542
The control room,
the probes, all of it?

713
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:47,625
The power source, sir.

714
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,375
I detonate it?

715
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,917
But how?
How do I do that?

716
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:55,709
The probes, sir.

717
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:58,458
The probes?
The probes.

718
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,125
Launch?

719
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:05,750
I launch the probes?

720
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,583
But why?

721
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:08,875
What good will that do?

722
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:11,250
The doors, sir.

723
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,625
Doors?

724
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:15,166
Perhaps the probes are
in a launch bay.

725
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,542
And if the doors
are closed,

726
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:20,583
then the backwash from
the rockets will spill

727
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:22,000
into the power grids,
and there will be an overload.

728
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,458
Yes, sir.

729
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,291
But the doors will
open automatically

730
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,166
when the launch begins.

731
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:28,458
And I will override.

732
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,542
Correct, sir.

733
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,500
Which control keys--
damn.

734
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,583
Of course,
you can't see.

735
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,291
Help.

736
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,834
Worf, help him up.

737
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,875
Describe, please.

738
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,959
I'm standing directly
in front of the gate.

739
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:54,500
To my left, there is
a small, triangular screen.

740
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,333
Right... one... meter.

741
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,750
Right.

742
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,917
Now, to my right is
a larger, triangular screen.

743
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:06,208
To the top is solid amber,
to the left, red.

744
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,542
DATA:
Correct.

745
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:12,041
Key blue, amber,
amber, red.

746
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,000
That's the launch sequence?

747
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:17,709
How do I override
the doors?

748
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:20,041
Blue, blue, blue.

749
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,917
I hope that's not
a stutter.

750
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,542
I don't know how long
a delay there will be

751
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:26,208
between the launch
and the detonation.

752
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,417
I will hold keying
the launch sequence

753
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:29,959
until you're through
the gate.

754
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:32,041
How long until
the<i> Enterprise</i> reappears?

755
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:36,417
Almost time.

756
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:40,709
Captain,
you will be killed.

757
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:43,125
I'll go through
the gate.

758
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,125
But where will
you end up?

759
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:49,125
Very shortly, anywhere will be
preferable to this room.

760
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,834
Mr. Worf,
I am depending on you.

761
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:53,875
You must get Data back
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

762
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:56,000
He may be
their only hope.

763
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,959
Aye, sir.

764
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,291
CREWMEMBER:
Commander, look!

765
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:18,750
Worf! What happened?
Where's the captain?

766
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,750
We must take Data
to engineering.

767
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,834
Hopefully,
the captain will follow.

768
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,709
I don't know
how to help him.

769
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,208
But comparing
recorded norms for Data

770
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,625
to these current
readings, it's clear

771
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:47,375
that all his functions
are just going crazy.

772
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,792
If we had an expert,
a maddox, somebody, I...

773
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:52,709
(<i> monitor beeping goes flat</i> )

774
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,583
He's gone.

775
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:22,542

What the hell?

780
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:46,375
I am accessing.

781
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,208
The self-correcting
mechanism.

782
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:52,250
DATA:
Captain? Captain!

783
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,125
Its constantly kicking in
to make minute adjustments

784
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,083
in the positronic brain.

785
00:40:56,083 --> 00:41:00,000
I am on the<i> Enterprise.</i>
How did I get here?

786
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,208
He cleared the Iconian program
from his system-- how?

787
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,709
Iconia...

788
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:07,375
I was on Iconia,

789
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,166
now I am on
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

790
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,625
Geordi, this is
critical-- how?!

791
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:12,333
Okay, give me
a second to think.

792
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,583
There was an incompatible
program running through

793
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,083
Data's system,
so the mechanism

794
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:19,417
started searching for
a way to keep him alive.

795
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:22,125
The solution...

796
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,750
the solution was
a shutdown

797
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,041
and a total wipe
of all affected memory.

798
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:28,542
Query.
What have I forgotten?

799
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:30,166
Can you do the same thing
with the<i> Enterprise?</i>

800
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,834
I don't see why not.
But it will have to be

801
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:33,667
a complete shutdown--
we turn her off

802
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,625
and affect a wipe
of the<i> Yamato</i> log

803
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:38,417
including every subsequent event
since we downloaded it.

804
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:40,458
I'll then be able to
reload all the ship's programs

805
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:42,834
from the protected archives
in the main core.

806
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,834
Geordi,
if we shut down,

807
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,709
that means we're going to be
bringing down the shields,

808
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:50,709
and we're hanging nose to nose
with a Romulan battle cruiser.

809
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,750
Hey, Commander,
whether it's Romulan phasers

810
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,917
or our own warp engines,
we're just as dead.

811
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,583
Make it so.

812
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:03,125
May I help?

813
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,083

Lock onto the captain
and bring him back.

817
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:27,417
Scanning, sir.

818
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:28,959
Got him.

Damn it!

828
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:53,417
Got him, sir.

829
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,792
He's on the Romulan ship.

You did this.

You sabotaged

838
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:17,000
Oh, no.

839
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,792
I cannot deactivate

that you will die

Yes, Captain?
Take us out of here.

847
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,041
The Romulan vessel is
set to auto-destruct,

848
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,375
and they can't deactivate.

849
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,667
Wait, sir, open
hailing frequencies.

850
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,333
Open, sir.
Commander Taris,

851
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,709
prepare to receive
a transmission

852
00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:54,125
from our chief engineer,
he'll instruct you

853
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,625
how to purge
your system.

854
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:57,709
TARIS:
Agreed,<i> Enterprise.</i>

855
00:43:57,709 --> 00:43:58,959
Standing by.

856
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:01,166
Commander,
your transmission has been

857
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,083
received
and acknowledged.

858
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,458
Now, Mr. Data,
warp speed please.

859
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:07,083
Just in case
Taris's engineer

860
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:09,125
is not as efficient
as our Mr. La Forge.

861
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,625
DATA:
Aye, sir.

862
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:12,375
Well, Number One,

863
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:15,417
I can see why you want to keep
the away missions to yourself.

864
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:17,208
That's where
the excitement is.

865
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:19,583
So, what's been
happening here?

866
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,750
Same old routine,
I suppose?
