1
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:14,417
No question about it.

2
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:16,375
She was bluffing, Worf.

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:20,625
Bluffing is not one of
Counselor Troi's strong suits.

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,458
I'm still reading
chlorinide leakage,

5
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,500
but I can't pin it down.

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,208
Maybe up here.

7
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,792
It would have been
unwise to call.

8
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:35,208
Yes, my hand was
not strong enough.

9
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,041
You had jacks
and eights.

10
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,083
She bluffed you
with a pair of sixes.

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,208
How did<i> you</i> know what I had?

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,458
Let's just say I had
a special insight

13
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,625
into the cards.

14
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,125
Maybe next time
you should bring a deck

15
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,959
that's not transparent
to infrared light.

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,375
Not to worry, Worf.

17
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,291
I only peek after
the hand is over.

18
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,125
(<i> sighs</i> )
Still nothing.

19
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,166
I'll get a dynoscan.
We'll try it again.

20
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,709
Commander, here's our latest
reading, should we continue on?

21
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:11,709
Yes, and if anything changes,
you let me know.

22
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:13,083
Yes, sir.

23
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,250
(<i> beeping</i> )

24
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,792
(<i> hissing</i> )

25
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,959
(<i> beeping continues</i> )

26
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:28,542
(<i> beeping gets louder</i> )

27
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,542
WOMAN:
Look out!

28
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:39,667
Worf!

29
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:42,083
MAN:
Commander, what happened?

30
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,417
La Forge to Sick Bay.

31
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:50,417
Medical emergency
in Cargo Bay three.

32
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,125
What happened?

33
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:03,125
The containers you were
checking fell on you.

34
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,166
You're lucky to be alive.

35
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,250
Doctor,
I will not attempt

36
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,333
to leave Sick Bay
without your approval.

37
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,166
The restraining field
is not necessary.

38
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,333
Worf...

39
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,750
there<i> is</i> 
no restraining field.

40
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,458
But I can't move my legs.

41
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,875
I know.

42
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,750
You can't move
because one of the containers

43
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,417
shattered seven
of your vertebrae

44
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:36,542
and crushed
your spinal cord.

45
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,250
I'm afraid there's no way

46
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,166
we can repair
this kind of injury.

47
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:25,041
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

48
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:29,083
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

49
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,583
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

50
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:35,542

53
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,417
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45587.3:</i>

54
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,500
<i>Lieutenant Worf has been</i>
<i>removed from active duty</i>

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,000
<i>following a severe injury.</i>

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,041
<i>Although a neuro-specialist</i>
<i>has arrived,</i>

57
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,834
<i>Dr. Crusher believes</i>
<i>his paralysis may be permanent.</i>

58
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,458
Welcome to the<i> Enterprise,</i> 
Dr. Russell.

59
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,041
I'm Beverly Crusher.
A pleasure.

60
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,917
I have some equipment
aboard the<i> Potemkin.</i>

61
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,709
Would you please have it sent
to one of your Medical Labs?

62
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,583
Of course.
Send it to Med Lab four.
CREWMAN: Yes, Doctor.

63
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,083
Before we get
down to business,

64
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,959
I just wanted to say
that I had the pleasure

65
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,000
of reading your paper
on cybernetic regeneration
recently.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,083
Really? You're the first
person to mention it.

67
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,375
I thought it
was brilliant.

68
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,917
Your ideas on
bioactive interfaces

69
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:25,333
border on
revolutionary.

70
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,417
It's going to be a genuine
pleasure working with you.

71
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,041
Thank you.

72
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,667
Have you had a chance to review
Worf's case history yet?

73
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:32,917
Only briefly.

74
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,667
I must admit,
I was a little shocked

75
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,667
to find the state of Klingon
neurological medicine

76
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,166
to be so primitive.
It's a cultural bias.

77
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,333
When I contacted the
Klingon Medical Division,

78
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,000
they informed me
that they usually

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
let the patient die
in a case like this.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,125
As a result, they've
done almost no research

81
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,583
on neurological trauma.

82
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,667
We'll be in
unchartered waters.

83
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,333
Worf is having a hard time
dealing with his injuries.

84
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,458
He's always been a difficult
patient, but now...

85
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,125
He's a little tough
at first,

86
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,625
but I'm sure
you'll like him after...

87
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,458
Doctor, I know that
as a starship doctor,

88
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,500
you have to maintain
close ties with patients,

89
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,709
but I think it would be best

90
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,125
if I maintain
a discreet distance.

91
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,542
That way I can give you
a completely objective opinion

92
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:12,709
regarding treatment.

93
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,125
Yes, you're probably right.

94
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,709
Good.

95
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:22,375
Well, I believe you said
I'd be working in Med Lab four?

96
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,709
Right. This way.

97
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,083
You look pretty good
for someone

98
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,625
who's been eating Sick Bay
food for three days.

99
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:38,583
Please, sit down, Commander.

100
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,458
Thank you for
agreeing to see me in...

101
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,625
this condition.

102
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,583
Oh, I'm not a Klingon.

103
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,959
I don't think there's any shame
in someone being injured.

104
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,083
I am not merely injured,
Commander.

105
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,291
Dr. Crusher believes
my paralysis to be...

106
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,208
permanent.

107
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,625
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,208
I have a personal
favor to ask.

109
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,333
Name it.

110
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,583
I want you to assist me
in performing

111
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,375
the<i> Hegh'bat</i> ceremony.

112
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,709
I want you to help me die.

113
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,166
What?

114
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,125
When a Klingon
can no longer stand

115
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,750
and face his enemies
as a warrior,

116
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,125
when he becomes a burden
to his friends and family,

117
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,875
it is time for the<i> Hegh'bat--</i>

118
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,959
time for him to die.

119
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,875
There must be other options.

120
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,250
No, there are not.

121
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,375
I will not live as an object
of pity or shame.

122
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,333
My life as a Klingon is over.

123
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:05,750
Mr. Worf...

124
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,959
I will not help a friend
commit suicide.

125
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,667
You and I have served
together for many years,

126
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:20,333
fought side by side.

127
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,959
I know you to be
a brave and honorable man.

128
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,250
If you truly
consider me a friend,

129
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,250
help me now.

130
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,458
Help me end my life
as I have lived it--

131
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:38,667
with dignity and honor.

132
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,417
Please.

133
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,750
The cortico-spinal
tract has continued

134
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,959
to deteriorate over
the last 72 hours

135
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,041
despite CPK
enzymatic therapy.

136
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,250
What about
alkysine treatment?

137
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,291
Ineffective.

138
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,834
Overdesigned.

139
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:07,667
Klingon anatomy--

140
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,333
23 ribs, two livers,

141
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,083
eight-chambered heart,

142
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,583
double-lined neural pia mater.

143
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,458
I've never seen
so many unnecessary

144
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,166
redundancies in one body.

145
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,083
Unnecessary?

146
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,667
The Klingons refer to it
as the<i> brak'lul.</i>

147
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:26,166
Almost every vital function
in their bodies

148
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,875
has a built-in redundancy

149
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,583
in case any primary organ
or system fails.

150
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,625
It's a good design
in theory,

151
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,792
but in practice,
all the extra organs

152
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:37,208
means just that much more
can go wrong.

153
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,667
Let me show you
something.

154
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:43,375
I've been experimenting
with DNA-based generators.

155
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,917
This is a genetronic
replicator.

156
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:49,959
It reads the DNA coding
of damaged organs,

157
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,166
translates that into a specific
set of replicant instructions

158
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:58,417
and then begins to grow
a replacement.

159
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:01,000
I've read of some of the
preliminary work you've done.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,667
The early results have been
very encouraging.

161
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,041
Beverly,
the genetronic replicator

162
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,792
can create a completely
new neural conduit

163
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,333
for your Lieutenant Worf.

164
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,125
Replace his entire
spinal column?
Exactly.

165
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,667
Instead of splicing
and pasting together

166
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,709
broken connections like
a couple of glorified tailors,

167
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:24,917
we create
a new living system.

168
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,375
I had no idea you were already
using this on humanoids.

169
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,333
I haven't been.

170
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,417
This will be the first time.

171
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,709
<i>First</i> time?

172
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:38,792
I've done dozens
of holo-simulations.

173
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,625
The success rate is up to 37%.

174
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,625
Even a holographic patient
would balk at those odds.

175
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,625
Sooner or later,

176
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,041
it has to be tried
on a living patient.

177
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,709
You're talking
about a spinal column.

178
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:54,542
Even before
we could replace it,

179
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,625
we have to remove
the existing one,

180
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,250
and we don't know enough about
Klingon neurological medicine

181
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,917
to reattach it.

182
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,458
If something goes wrong,
he'll die.

183
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:07,417
I agree it has
remarkable potential,

184
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,792
but you're still in the most
preliminary stages of research.

185
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:14,542
No, I'm afraid I can't
justify the risk to Worf.

186
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,917
We'll have to do with more
conventional approaches.

187
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,375
PICARD: Dr. Crusher,
please report to the Bridge.

188
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,250
On my way.

189
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,792
Doctor, the transport ship
<i>Denver</i> has struck

190
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,750
a gravitic mine left over
from the Cardassian War.

191
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,458
They've sustained
heavy damage.

192
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,333
Their last message said they
were attempting to crash-land

193
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,375
on one of the planets
in the Mericor system.

194
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,083
We should arrive
in just under seven hours.

195
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,667
How many people
were aboard?

196
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,291
The<i> Denver's</i> standard
crew complement is 23,

197
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,750
but they were transporting
517 colonists

198
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,208
to the Beloti sector.

199
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,667
I'll need to convert
all three Shuttle Bays

200
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,291
into emergency
triage centers.

201
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,208
I want all civilians
with medical training

202
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,834
to report for duty.

203
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,250
Make it so.

204
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,500
Captain, may I speak
to you in private?

205
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,834
Of course, Number One.

206
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,041
You have the Bridge,
Mr. Data.
Aye, sir.

207
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:18,417
I have always tried
to keep an open mind--

208
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:21,250
not to judge someone else's
culture by my own--

209
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,750
but for me to be
part of this "ceremony"...

210
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,458
I understand
from Dr. Crusher

211
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,959
that Worf will never regain
the use of his legs.

212
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,166
That doesn't mean
that his life is over.

213
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,959
That's a very
human perspective, Will.

214
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,542
For a Klingon
in Worf's position...

215
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,166
his life is over.

216
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,959
I can't accept that.

217
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,667
Will, if you were dying,

218
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,959
if you were terminally ill
with an incurable disease

219
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,417
and facing the remaining
few days of your life in pain--

220
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:54,417
wouldn't you come to look
on death as a release?

221
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,208
Worf isn't dying
and he is not in pain.

222
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,041
He could lead
a long life...

223
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,083
You and I could learn to live
with a disability like that,

224
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,667
but not Worf.

225
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:08,583
His life ended when those
containers fell on him.

226
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,291
Now, we don't have
to agree with it,

227
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,083
we don't have to
understand it,

228
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,083
but we do have to
respect his beliefs.

229
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,000
I can respect his beliefs,

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,750
but he is asking me
to take an active part

231
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,709
in his committing suicide!

232
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,125
He's asking for your help
because you're his friend.

233
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,000
That means that you're going
to have to make your decision

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,083
based on that friendship.

235
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:38,083
Which leaves me right back
where I started.

236
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,834
Will...

237
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:42,542
Look, I'm sorry.

238
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:45,667
I cannot help you
to make this decision.

239
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,625
But I can tell you this:

240
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,709
Klingons choose their friends
with great care.

241
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,959
If he didn't know
he could count on you,

242
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,166
he would never have asked.

243
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,041
Why won't you let me see him?

244
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,208
Alexander, I told you
it's not my decision.

245
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,041
Your father
doesn't want...

246
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,792
I don't believe you!
My father wants to see me!

247
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:14,792
You're the one keeping me
away from him.

248
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,041
I think you know
that's not true.

249
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,208
Then why can't I see him?

250
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,166
Come here.

251
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,959
He's been injured

252
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,875
and he's embarrassed.

253
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,166
And to have anyone
see him now

254
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,041
would make him
feel worse,

255
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,709
even if it were you.

256
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:44,500
This is part of that
Klingon stuff, isn't it?

257
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,959
My mother
always said Klingons

258
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,000
had a lot of dumb ideas
about honor.

259
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,083
Alexander,
that Klingon stuff

260
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,083
is very important
to your father.

261
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,750
Well, it isn't
very important to me.

262
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,875
I don't care
about being Klingon.

263
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,750
I just want
to see my father.

264
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,667
It's been a long day.

265
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:05,000
Why don't you get
ready for bed

266
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,500
and we'll talk about this
again in the morning, hmm?

267
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,583
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

268
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,792
Alexander is scared,
confused, hurt...

269
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:24,750
all because his father
is refusing to see him.

270
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,875
You know why I left
those instructions.

271
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,458
Yes, I do.

272
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,500
It's not
the Klingon way, right?

273
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,458
It is a question of honor,

274
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,041
and I would ask that you
respect my wishes

275
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,333
in this matter, Counselor.

276
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,583
All I care about
at this moment

277
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,750
is a little boy
who's terrified

278
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,083
he's going to
lose his father.

279
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,583
(<i> door opens</i> )

280
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,917
Maybe it's time
you stopped lying here

281
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:56,083
worrying about your honor

282
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,333
and started thinking
about someone else,

283
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,417
like your son.

284
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,333
Would you like us
to come back later?

285
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,750
No, no.
Please come in, Doctor.

286
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,083
This is Dr. Toby Russell.

287
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,875
She's from the Adelman
Neurological Institute.

288
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,667
She specializes in
spinal injuries like yours.

289
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:23,583
We've discussed a variety
of surgical procedures.

290
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,458
I'm afraid none of them
will repair the spinal cord,

291
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,875
but we have found a way for you
to regain much of your mobility.

292
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,709
We can implant a series of
neural transducers

293
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,667
into your lower torso
and legs.

294
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,208
They're designed to pick up

295
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,875
the electrical impulses
from your brain

296
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,417
and stimulate
the corresponding muscles.

297
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,250
With a little work,

298
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,875
you can eventually regain 60%
to 70% of your motor control.

299
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,125
The first step would be
to fit your legs

300
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,834
with motor-assist units
like this one.

301
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:55,125
They're a training device.

302
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,125
Once you've mastered
using them,

303
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,709
we can move on
to the implants.

304
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,709
Now, try to move your leg.

305
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,333
No, no.
That's good for a first try.

306
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,000
It will take some time

307
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,417
before you get used
to manipulating...

308
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,500
No!

309
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,041
I will not live like that.

310
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,542
These are very
sophisticated devices.

311
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,166
With enough time,
they will give you...

312
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,333
WORF:
60% of my mobility?

313
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:32,875
No, I will not be
seen lurching

314
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:36,959
through corridors like
some half-Klingon machine--

315
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,959
the object of
ridicule and disgust.

316
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:43,500
Perhaps all this seems
a bit frightening to you now.

317
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,959
I want you to take some time
before making a decision.

318
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:50,083
Think about it.

319
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:54,000
There is one other option
I'd like you to consider.

320
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,959
It's called
genetronic replication.

321
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,375
It's still in
the experimental stage,

322
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,083
but if it works,

323
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,875
it will restore virtually
all your mobility

324
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,458
and without the need
for artificial implants.

325
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,583
I thought we had
discussed genetronics.
We did.

326
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,375
I also thought we decided
against recommending it.

327
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,792
You heard him.

328
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:30,000
He'd rather die than
live with the implants.

329
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,417
I just gave him a better
option than suicide.

330
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,959
He's grasping for straws
and you're giving him one.

331
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,875
Now, instead of dealing
with his paralysis,

332
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,125
he's going to be thinking about
this miracle cure of yours.

333
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,750
There's a real chance
this could work.

334
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,166
And, if it does,
it will be

335
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,166
a major breakthrough
in neurogenics

336
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,375
that will change
a lot of people's lives.

337
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,709
You're using the desperation
of an injured man

338
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,792
as an excuse
to try a procedure

339
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:55,333
that you couldn't do
under normal circumstances.

340
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,291
I checked with
Starfleet Medical.

341
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,917
They have turned down your
request to test genetronics

342
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:04,166
on humanoids
three times already.

343
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,750
Are you really
going to hide

344
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,667
behind the rules
of some bureaucracy?

345
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:11,917
Beverly, your patient's
life is at stake here.

346
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,583
Look, before you
do any of this...

347
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,166
PICARD:
Picard to Dr. Crusher.

348
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,625
Go ahead, Captain.

349
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,792
We've located the survivors
from the<i> Denver.</i>

350
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,500
We're ready down here.

351
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,125
We have triage teams
standing by.
Very well.

352
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,959
We'll begin transporting the
survivors on board immediately.

353
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,333
Bridge out.

354
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:32,125
Beverly, could you use
an extra pair of hands?

355
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,959
Absolutely.

356
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,166
Father?

357
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,000
Come in, Alexander.

358
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,291
Deanna said you
hurt your back.

359
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,500
That you couldn't walk.

360
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,792
I am still struggling
with my injury.

361
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,959
I was worried about you.

362
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,959
There is much to discuss.

363
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:03,166
There will be
difficult times ahead.

364
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,834
You must be strong.

365
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,667
I understand.

366
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,792
Good.

367
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:12,542
As Klingons, we all
must be prepared for...

368
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,125
(<i> grunts</i> )

369
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,083
Father!

370
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,667
Take him away.

371
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:20,917
Worf, let me help you.

372
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:23,458
Leave!
Alexander, go on.

373
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,875
It'll be all right.
I'll take care of your father.

374
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,709
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

375
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,834
WOMAN:
Doctor, please.

376
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,583
MAN:
Hey, easy now.

377
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,750
MAN #2:
With this patient right here?

378
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,166
WOMAN #2:
Yes.

379
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,583
Use this to cauterize
the tissue.

380
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,041
Yes, Doctor.

381
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,041
(<i> patients moaning</i> )

382
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,750
MAN:
Doctor, we need you right now.

383
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,542
WOMAN:
We have to get back in the lab.

384
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,041
WOMAN #2:
I need more help, please.

385
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,333
MAN:
Yes, right here, right here.

386
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,792
WOMAN #2:
Thank you.

387
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,625
MAN #2:
Hold this right...
just like that.

388
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,000
What happened here?

389
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,583
He went into neural
metaphasic shock.

390
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,625
From leporazine?
That's unusual.

391
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,250
He couldn't take leporazine.

392
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,750
His blood pressure
was too low.

393
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,458
I had to try
a different treatment.

394
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,166
A morathial series?
No.

395
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,166
I tried a new rybotherapy
I've been working with.

396
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,917
It's called borathium.

397
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,917
I've had some
very good results.

398
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:36,792
You used this man to test
one of your theories?

399
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:40,291
Borathium is decades ahead
of leporazine and morathial.

400
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,959
Morathial would have
saved his life.

401
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:45,250
His injuries were so severe,

402
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,750
I don't think any conventional
treatment would have saved him.

403
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,792
The point is you didn't even
try standard treatment.

404
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:52,875
I made the choice

405
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,500
I thought gave him
the best chance of surviving.

406
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,375
Isn't that what you
would have done?

407
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,000
I think you used
this situation

408
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,542
in order to test
one of your theories,

409
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,083
just like you're trying
to do with Worf.

410
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,500
That's what this is
really about, isn't it?

411
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,959
Lieutenant Worf.

412
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:09,667
I'm offering him a chance
to recover fully--

413
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:11,542
a chance you can't give him.

414
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:14,959
What this is about
is the kind of medicine
you seem to practice.

415
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,709
I make no excuses for
my approach to medicine.

416
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:20,875
I don't like losing a patient
any more than you do,

417
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,875
but I'm looking
down a long road, Doctor.

418
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,041
This man didn't die
for nothing.

419
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,458
The data that I gathered
is invaluable.

420
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,125
It will eventually help
save thousands of lives.

421
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,917
I doubt if that will be
of any comfort to his family.

422
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,291
Let me ask you this.

423
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,166
If, some years from now,

424
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:43,125
borathium therapy were to save
the life of someone you loved,

425
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,917
would you still condemn me?

426
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:47,417
I will not be drawn into
a hypothetical argument, Doctor.

427
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:50,125
Your research
on this ship is over.

428
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,083
You are relieved of all medical
duties until further notice.

429
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,458
Is that clear?

430
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,250
Perfectly.

431
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:12,542
Doctor, I'm on my way
to look in on your patient.

432
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,542
Be my guest.

433
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,583
Just don't expect
a lot of conversation.

434
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,458
He's in full Klingon mode--

435
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,583
honorable, strong
and closed-minded.

436
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:27,208
I understand that you've
relieved Dr. Russell of duty.

437
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,625
That's right.
She's irresponsible.

438
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,375
I won't have her practicing
medicine on this ship.

439
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,458
Beverly...

440
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,625
maybe you should consider
letting her go ahead

441
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:48,542
with this
genetronic procedure.

442
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,959
How can you say that?

443
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:59,166
She has a<i> theory</i> based on
a little empirical knowledge

444
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,250
and<i> a lot</i> of supposition.

445
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,667
If he can't make
a full recovery...

446
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,959
Worf will kill himself.

447
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:10,125
Not in my Sick Bay,
he won't.

448
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,834
I'll put him in
a restraining field

449
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,291
and post security
around his door

450
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,709
before I let him
commit suicide.

451
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:16,125
And how long will you
keep him there?

452
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,208
A week? A month? A year?

453
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,542
If I have to.

454
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,709
Suicide is not an option.

455
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:24,917
Putting aside for the moment

456
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:28,291
the fact that a paraplegic
can live a very full life,

457
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:29,959
there is also
a conventional therapy

458
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,625
that could restore
much of his mobility.

459
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,458
But not all of it.
No, not all of it!

460
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:37,542
There are some things
I can't fix!

461
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,959
Klingon or no,

462
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,625
he is going to have to
accept his condition.

463
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:46,208
Beverly, he can't make the
journey you're asking of him.

464
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:50,000
You want him to go from
contemplating suicide

465
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,750
to accepting his condition
and living with a disability,

466
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,125
but it's<i> too far.</i>

467
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:58,375
And the road between covers
a lifetime of values...

468
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,000
beliefs.

469
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,458
He can't do it,
Beverly.

470
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,917
But...

471
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:10,750
perhaps he can come
part of the way.

472
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,041
Maybe he can be persuaded
to forego the ritual

473
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,625
in order to
take the chance

474
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:21,291
of regaining
the kind of life he needs.

475
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:25,041
A Klingon may not be good
at accepting defeat,

476
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:28,625
but he knows
all about taking risks.

477
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:33,500
The first tenet
of good medicine

478
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,959
is never make
the patient any worse.

479
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:41,792
Right now, Worf is
alive and functioning.

480
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,250
If he goes into
that operation,

481
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,500
he could come out
a corpse.

482
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:51,750
And this may not be
good medicine,

483
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,834
but for Worf...

484
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:56,417
it may be
his only choice.

485
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:16,959
I am ready, Commander.

486
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:20,417
I've been studying
this ritual of yours.

487
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:22,583
Do you know what
I've decided?

488
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:25,542
I think it's despicable.

489
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,250
I hate everything about it--

490
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,041
casual disregard
for life,

491
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,667
the way it tries
to cloak suicide

492
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:33,959
in some glorious
notion of honor.

493
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:37,125
I may have to respect
your beliefs,

494
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,083
but I don't
have to like them.

495
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:44,667
It is not something
I expect you to understand.

496
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:47,208
No-- all you really
expect me to do

497
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:50,500
is bring you the knife,
and then walk away

498
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,333
so you can kill yourself
in peace.

499
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,750
Well...

500
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,458
I'm not going to make it
that easy for you.

501
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,875
It is not easy for me,

502
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:07,166
but each of us must die
at our own time and my time...

503
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,583
Do you remember Sandoval?

504
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,834
Hit with a disrupter
blast two years ago?

505
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:12,458
She lived for about a week.

506
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:16,083
Fang-lee,
Marla Aster,

507
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,583
Tasha Yar?

508
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,041
How many men and women--

509
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,417
how many friends
have we watched die?

510
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:23,000
I've lost count.

511
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,667
Every one of them--

512
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:28,250
every single one fought
for life until the very end.

513
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,208
I do not welcome death,
Commander.

514
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,083
Are you sure?

515
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,959
Because I get the sense
you're feeling pretty noble
about this whole thing.

516
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:39,250
"Look at me.
Aren't I courageous?

517
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,667
Aren't I
an honorable Klingon?"

518
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,375
Let me remind you
of something.

519
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,083
A Klingon does not
put his desires

520
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:48,625
above those of his family
or his friends.

521
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:55,417
How many people on this ship
consider you a friend?

522
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:58,792
How many owe you their lives?

523
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,625
Have you ever thought

524
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,750
about how you've affected
the people around you?

525
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,500
How we might feel
about your dying?

526
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,792
Will you or will you not

527
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:11,792
help me with the<i> Hegh'bat?</i>

528
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,291
You are my friend...

529
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:22,375
...and in spite of
everything I've said,

530
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:25,583
if it were my place,

531
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,500
I would probably help you.

532
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,125
But I've been studying
Klingon ritual and Klingon law

533
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,083
and I've discovered

534
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,291
that it's not my place
to fill that role.

535
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,834
According to tradition,

536
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:40,875
that<i> honor</i> falls
to a family member,

537
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:43,166
preferably the oldest son.

538
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:46,375
That is impossible.
He is a child.

539
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,709
"The son of a Klingon is a man

540
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:51,041
the day he can first
hold a blade."

541
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:52,375
True?

542
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:54,583
Alexander is not fully Klingon.

543
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:57,583
He is part human.
That's an excuse.

544
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:59,250
What you really mean

545
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,125
is it would be too hard
to look at your son

546
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:05,208
and tell him
to bring you the knife,

547
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,500
watch you stab it
into your heart,

548
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,750
then pull the knife
out of your chest

549
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,750
and wipe your blood
on his sleeve.

550
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,583
That's the rite
of death, isn't it?

551
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,792
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Worf.

552
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,083
I can't help you.

553
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:26,709
There's only one person
on this ship who can.

554
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,583
You said you
wanted to see me?

555
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:51,375
I need you to help me.

556
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,959
Anything, Father.

557
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,333
I have taught you about

558
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:59,250
Klingon customs--

559
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,000
the beliefs which we value.

560
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,208
According to tradition,

561
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,333
I must take my life

562
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,000
after suffering
this kind of injury.

563
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:15,917
But I have decided
to break with tradition.

564
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:18,583
I have decided to live.

565
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm glad, Father.

566
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,250
I must still undergo
a dangerous operation.

567
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,166
I may still die,

568
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:31,709
but it will not be
by my own hand.

569
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,667
Return this
to our quarters.

570
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,709
Yes, sir.

573
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,542
<i>and a great deal</i>
<i>of soul-searching,</i>

574
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,834
<i>I have reluctantly granted</i>

575
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,000
<i>to undergo</i>
<i>the genetronic procedure.</i>

576
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,500
We started doing
multiplications today.

577
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,709
The teacher said I'm faster
than anybody else in my class.

578
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:30,417
We will speak again soon.

579
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:34,000
Yes, Father.

580
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:46,792
If I die...

581
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,333
...he must be cared for.

582
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:55,750
I'll make sure he reaches
your parents' home safely.

583
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,166
No. They are elderly.

584
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,750
They cannot care
for Alexander.

585
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:13,250
Counselor,
I have a serious request

586
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,291
to make of you.

587
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:19,291
Would you consider...

588
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,417
You want<i> me</i> 
to raise Alexander?

589
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:30,625
I have come to have
a great respect for you, Deanna.

590
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,417
You have been most helpful

591
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:38,625
in guiding me
since Alexander's arrival.

592
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:45,208
I can't imagine anyone

593
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:48,333
who would be a better
parent to my son.

594
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:53,375
If it is too much to ask...

595
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,542
I'd be honored.

596
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,709
I am ready.

597
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,875
RUSSELL:
Focus the drechtal beams

598
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:19,875
on the anterior
and posterior spinal roots.

599
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,208
DR. CRUSHER:
Focused.

600
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,333
RUSSELL:

601
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:26,792
All neural connections below

have been separated.

603
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,041
Microtome.

604
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,709
I'm severing the brain stem...

605
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:39,166
now.

606
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:43,291
Cerebral cortex placed
on life support

607
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,208
at 0831 hours--
three hours

608
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:48,375
26 minutes remaining until onset
of primary brain dysfunction.

609
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:51,291
Okay, let's remove
the support frame.

610
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,458
Exoscalpel.

611
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,041
I've notified Starfleet that our
survey of sector 37628

612
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,834
will be delayed by at least
a week while we drop off

613
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:12,625
the survivors
from the<i> Denver.</i> 
Good.

614
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:16,375
I understand
from Mr. La Forge

615
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,917
that there's a minor fluctuation
in the starboard warp coil.

616
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:20,875
I've scheduled
a stress simulation routine

617
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,959
for this afternoon
to check it out.

618
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,750
Has there been any word?

619
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:34,875
No.

620
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,959
DR. CRUSHER: Preliminary
genetronic scans are complete.

621
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,125

622
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:54,667
Initiating DNA sequencer.

Reading the initial sequences

624
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,208
at ten to the ninth base

625
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:03,000
Once we're past
the first two levels,

626
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,250
we'll begin
the encoding sequence.

627
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,375
Increase TCH levels to...
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

628
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,583
What's happened?

629
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:10,959
The scanner is having trouble

630
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,917
reading the Klingon
dorsal root ganglia.

631
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,750
Did this show up
in your simulations?

632
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,583
Yes, but I thought I made
sufficient adjustments.

633
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:20,291
Bring me
the detronal scanner.

634
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:26,542
I can scan
the ganglia manually.

635
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,583
It will just take
a little longer.

636
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:32,125
One hour, 43 minutes until
primary brain dysfunction.

637
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:06,375
Retract the paraspinal muscle.
Got it.

638
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:08,500
Watch the proximal
nerve endings.

639
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,291
I see them.

640
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,333
Make sure the cranial
segment is at least

641
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,375
15 centimeters
from the brain stem.

642
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,500
I'm reading a slight fluctuation
in the isocortex.

644
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:24,417
Okay.

645
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:28,375
Release the retractors
on the paraspinal.

646
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,417
How much longer can we
keep him on life support?

647
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:31,959
27 minutes.

648
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:33,709

649
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,875
Close, please.

650
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:39,709
Ready.

Okay. Ready.

00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,625
Terminate life support.

655
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,917

All right, let's go

Showing no higher
brain functions.

676
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:06,250
Okay. 25 CC's cordrazine.
That'll kill him.

Looks like we've done
a pretty good job of that
already, Doctor.

25 CC's polyadrenaline.

706
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:10,291
What's going on?

707
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:12,834
I'm not sure,
but if I'm right,

708
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:15,375
one of those unnecessary
redundancies...
Doctor!

709
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,458
DR. CRUSHER:
I don't believe it.

710
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,542
Begin cardio-aid
and ventilation.

711
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,458
That's amazing.

712
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:26,250
There must be a backup for
his synaptic functions as well.

713
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,834
Vital signs
are stabilizing.

714
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:30,834
DR. CRUSHER:
Begin rybosomatic therapy.

715
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:33,000
Increase oxygen mixture
to 90%.

716
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,917
Let's prepare a thalamic
booster series.

717
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,500
Well, I'd say your patient's
recovery is going well.

718
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,458
You aren't even
going to acknowledge

719
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,083
what I did for him,
are you?

720
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:07,250
You just can't admit
that it was my research

721
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,083
that made this possible.

722
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:15,500
I am delighted that Worf
is going to recover.

723
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:19,208
You gambled, he won.

724
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:24,166
Not all of your patients
are so lucky.

725
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:28,917
You scare me, Doctor.

726
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:31,542
You risk your patients' lives

727
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:34,750
and justify it
in the name of research.

728
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,041
Genuine research
takes time.

729
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:41,750
Sometimes a lifetime
of painstaking,

730
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,542
detailed work in order
to get any results.

731
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:47,166
Not for you.

732
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,458
You take shortcuts,

733
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:52,291
right through
living tissue.

734
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:56,291
You put your research ahead
of your patients' lives,

735
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:58,458
and as far as
I'm concerned,

736
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:02,000
that's a violation
of our most sacred trust.

737
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,750
I'm sure your work
will be hailed

738
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,250
as a stunning
breakthrough.

739
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,208
Enjoy your laurels, Doctor.

740
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,625
I'm not sure I could.

741
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,667
(<i> Worf grunting</i> )

742
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,458
DR. CRUSHER: This is going
to take time, Worf.

743
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:47,709
Your muscles are still
sorting out their new signals.

744
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,875
Don't rush it.

745
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:54,875
(<i> groaning</i> )

746
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:57,458
Alexander, Alexander,

747
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,625
remember what
we talked about?

748
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:03,417
Your father wants to
do this by himself.

749
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,375
It's all right, Counselor.

750
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:09,750
I would appreciate
some help from my son.

751
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:22,583
We will work together.

752
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:24,542
Yes, sir.
