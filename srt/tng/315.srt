11
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:51,166

12
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,542

13

Yes and no.

33
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,166

a discernible event horizon.

35
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:10,667
Sir, navigational

the phenomenon

A rift?

94
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,291
Possibly the formation
of a Kerr loop

from superstring material.

96
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,375
It would require high-energy

DATA:
Away team reporting in, Captain.

184
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,166
On screen.

185
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,709
Go ahead, Commander.

186
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,709
RIKER:
We've stabilized life-support.

187
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,250
Mr. La Forge is working
on restoring

188
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,250
the main power couplings,
but that'll take time.

189
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,959
It's a real mess
down here, sir.

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,333
Survivors?

191
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,250
One hundred twenty-five.

192
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,417
Recommendations?

193
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,959
I'd hate to have to scrap her.

194
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,208
Starfleet could certainly
use another ship,

195
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,709
even if she is old.

196
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,125
Agreed, but we can't stay
in this area too long.

197
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,333
You have nine hours.

198
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,500
If you can get her underway
by then,

199
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,333
we'll escort her
to Starbase 105.

200
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,083
If not, we'll evacuate
the survivors

201
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,291
and destroy the ship.

202
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,834
Understood, sir.

203
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:04,834
Keep me posted.

204
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,166

Guinan?

206
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,625
We need to talk.

207
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:26,166
Somehow this...
this is all wrong.

208
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,792
This is not the way
it's supposed to be.

209
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,125
But you must have some idea
how things have changed.

210
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,250
I look at things,
I look at people and...

211
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,417
they just don't feel right.

212
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,000
What things, what people?

213
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,417
You.

214
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,208
Your uniform,
the Bridge.

215
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,500
What's the matter
with the Bridge?

216
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,625
It's not right.
It's the same Bridge.

217
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:58,667
Nothing has changed.

218
00:11:58,709 --> 00:11:59,917
I know that.

219
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,875
I also know it's wrong.

220
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,500

221
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,750

222
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,333
Families.

223
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,041
There should be children
on this ship.

224
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,709
What?!

225
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,750
Children on the<i> Enterprise?</i>

226
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,583
Guinan, we're at war.

227
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,709
No, we're not.

228
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,875
At least,
we're not supposed to be.

229
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,750
This is not a ship of war.

230
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,125
This is a ship
of peace.

231
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,667
What you're suggesting...

232
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,166
I'm not suggesting.

233
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,834
That ship from the past
is not supposed to be here.

234
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,750
It's got to go back.

235
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,208
MAN:
Get a radiation level.

236
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,250

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,333

Boost the level

242
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,917

Rachel Garrett.

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,083
How's my ship?

248
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,667
The support systems
are being restored.

249
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,125
We're continuing
repairs.

250
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,583
Where did you come from?

251
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,875
We weren't picking up

252
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:35,041
any other Federation ships
in this sector.

253
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,792
What's the last thing
you remember?

254
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,959
We were answering
the distress signal.

255
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,583
Distress signal?

256
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,667
You must have heard it.

257
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:51,834
From the Klingon outpost,
Narendra III.

258
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,834
But you didn't, did you?

259
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:05,875
This Sick Bay,
I've never seen anything like it

260
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:07,458
even on a Starbase.

261
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,417
And your uniforms.

262
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,333
What ship is this, Captain?

263
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,500
Please try to be still.

264
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,083
GARRETT:
I must insist.

265
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,583
What ship?

266
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,917
(<i> sighs</i> )

267
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,625
You're aboard the
<i>Enterprise,</i> Captain.

268
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,709
1701-D.

269
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,625
You have come 22 years
into the future.

270
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,709
22 years?

271
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,291
Does my crew know yet?

272
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,500
No.

273
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:49,500
I must tell them.
I owe them that.

274
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:52,542
If you wish, I can see
that they're informed.

275
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,875
Is there some reason
they should not be told?

276
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:58,291
I am concerned that if you
return to your own time

277
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,875
with knowledge of the future...

278
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:01,000
Return to the battle?

279
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,625
We barely escaped
with our lives.

280
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,250
If we returned,
we'd be destroyed.

281
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,667
Have you any idea
how this happened?

282
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,250
There was a... fierce volley
of photon torpedoes.

283
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,375
We were hit.

284
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,125
A bright light, and then here.

285
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,333
It is possible
that this exchange of fire

286
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,709
was the catalyst

287
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,000
for the formation
of a temporal rift.

288
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:32,625
History has no record of your
battle with the Romulans.

289
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:35,417
We were responding
to a distress call

290
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,959
from the Klingon outpost
on Narendra III.

291
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,917
The Romulans were attacking it.

292
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,166
We engaged them,

293
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,333
but there were
four warbirds.

294
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,417
The Narendra III outpost
was destroyed.

295
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,959
It is regrettable

296
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,458
that you did
not succeed.

297
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,166
A Federation starship

298
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,500
rescuing
a Klingon outpost

299
00:15:57,542 --> 00:16:00,125
might have averted
20 years of war.

300
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,250
I still can't quite
make myself believe it.

301
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,917
22 years.

302
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,166
I'm reading 40 percent
on forward shields.

303
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,834
What do you have on aft?

304
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,041
40 percent.

305
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,250
That won't cut it.

306
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,500
Commander,
advise Lieutenant La Forge

307
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:26,792
that shields are
below minimum.

308
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,125
Acknowledged.

309
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,291
We'll never see our homes again,
our families.

310
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,625
How do you know your
family's not still alive?

311
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:43,291
You're right, I don't.

312
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,250
But imagine coming home
after 22 years.

313
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,041
Would I even
recognize them?

314
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,750
What are the stats
on the main phaser banks?

315
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:55,750
Emitters available,
60% forward, 52% aft.

316
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:58,750
Good. Let's take a look
at the torpedo launchers.

317
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,625
I guess I'm lucky
to be alive at all.

318
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,125
You may not
like the future.

319
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,667
It's been a long war.

320
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,041
The Federation has lost

321
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,834
more than half of Starfleet
to the Klingons.

322
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,000
We were negotiating
a peace treaty when I left.

323
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,375
A lot of changes,
Lieutenant.

324
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,959
A<i> lot</i> of changes.

325
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,625
When we get a break,
maybe you could

326
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,667
fill me in
on some of them.

327
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,500
Photon banks
are depleted.

328
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:48,208
Auxiliary fusion
generators are down.

329
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,667
There is a high degree
of probability

330
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,709
that the temporal rift
is symmetrical, Captain.

331
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,458
PICARD:
Then what would happen
if the<i> Enterprise-C</i> were

332
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,041
to fly back
through it?

333
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,917
Back, sir?

334
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:05,417
The<i> Enterprise-C</i> would
emerge in her own time

335
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,500
at almost the same
instant she left.

336
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,750
Right in the middle
of the battle with the Romulans.

337
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,333
Yes, sir.

338
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,375
Is there any possibility
she could survive?

339
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,000
None, sir.

340
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:20,000
Then sending them back
would be a death sentence.

on the weapon system.

361
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,458
From what Captain Picard
told me,

362
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,875
the Federation can use
all the help it can get.

363
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,208
YAR:
And soon.

364
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,208
Our sensors have picked
up Klingon warships

365
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,500
in this sector, Captain.

366
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,041
Why wasn't I informed,
Mr. Castillo?

367
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,166
Captain, you shouldn't...

368
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,458
As senior officer,
I want you to be

369
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,917
my liaison
to the<i> Enterprise-D.</i>

370
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,000
Coordinate
with tactical.

371
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,166
YAR:
That's me, Captain.

372
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,041
Where do you think
you're going?

373
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,875
I am resuming
my duties, Doctor.

374
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,291
Captain, you need at least
another 24 hours.

375
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,000
Nonsense, doctors always
overprotect their patients.

376
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,834
And Captains always push
themselves too hard.

377
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,917
Doctor, my ship
and my crew need me now.

378
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,458
24 hours might as well
be 24 years.

379
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,375
(<i> door opens</i> )

380
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,792
I need more.

381
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:09,000
There is no more.

382
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,125
I wish there were.

383
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,959
I wish I could prove it,
but I can't.

384
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:18,125
Then I can't
ask them to go back.

385
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,583
You've got to.

386
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,834
Guinan, they will die
moments after they return.

387
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,000
How can I ask them
to sacrifice themselves

388
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,959
based solely on your intuition?

389
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,417
I don't know.

390
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,375
But I do know
that this is a mistake.

391
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:38,375
Every fiber in my being says
<i>this</i> is a mistake.

392
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:41,417
I can't explain it to myself,
so I can't explain it to you.

393
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,875
I only know that I'm right.

394
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,375
Who is to say
that this history

395
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,834
is any less proper
than the other?

396
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,166
I suppose I am.

397
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,417
Not good enough, damn it,
not good enough!

398
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,792
I will not ask
them to die!

399
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:59,000
40 billion people
have already died.

400
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,875
This war is not supposed
to be happening.

401
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:03,375
You've got to send those people
back to correct this.

402
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:06,000
And what is to guarantee that if
they go back, they will succeed?

403
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:12,083
Every instinct is telling me
this is wrong,

404
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,458
it is dangerous,
it is futile!

405
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,917
We've known each other
a long time.

406
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:23,875
You have never known me
to impose myself on anyone

407
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,542
or take a stance
based on trivial

408
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,125
or whimsical perceptions.

409
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,208
This timeline must not
be allowed to continue.

410
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,625
Now, I've told you
what you must do.

411
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:40,083
You have only your trust in me
to help you decide to do it.

412
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,417
(<i> door closes</i> )

413
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,125
I mean, deflector
shield technology

414
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,917
has advanced considerably
during the war.

415
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,667
Our heat-dissipation
rates are probably double

416
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,375
those of the<i> Enterprise-C.</i>

417
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:03,667
Which means we can hang in
a firefight a lot longer.

418
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,000
Guinan?

419
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,875
Have you ordered yet, Tasha?

420
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:14,125
No, not yet.

421
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:17,458
Is anything wrong?

422
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,208
Not a thing.

423
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,458
What can I get for you?

424
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Just a couple of T-K-Ls.

425
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,083
We're in a hurry.

426
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,959
Oh, this is
Lieutenant Castillo.

427
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,458
Mm.

428
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,875
First time for everything.

429
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:43,291
First time?

430
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:48,125
It's just that I've never seen
anything bother her before.

431
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,125
What's a T-K-L?

432
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,500
Standard rations.

433
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,625
Food replicators
are on minimum power

434
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:59,041
so everything else is diverted
to the defensive systems.

435
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,083
So where was I?

436
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,750
You've told me more
about tactical in an hour

437
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:05,959
than I learned in my last year
at the academy.

438
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,667
You're going to
need it, Lieutenant.

439
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:09,709
Hey...

440
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,166
I've known you
a whole day now, Lieutenant.

441
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,542
I won't salute if you won't.

442
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,041
What did she
call you-- Tasha?

443
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,458
Yeah.

444
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,500
Most everyone
calls me Castillo.

445
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,709
My mother calls me Richard.

446
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,875
Okay, Castillo.

447
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,041
No, I think maybe
I'd like it better

448
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,834
if you called me Richard.

449
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,083
Richard.

450
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,125
PICARD:
This is the Captain.

451
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,625
Senior officers will report

452
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,875
to my ready room
immediately.

453
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:45,792
So much for lunch.

454
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,750
Captain, are you suggesting
that we let them return

455
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,375
and attempt to complete
their mission?

456
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,375
I am, Doctor.

457
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,750
Based on Guinan's
intuition?

458
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,208
That won't accomplish
anything, sir.

459
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,166
There's no way they can save
Narendra III.

460
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,667
Captain Garrett said there
were four Romulan warbirds.

461
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,166
The<i> Enterprise-C</i> would be
outmanned and outgunned.

462
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,625
Unless we were
to re-arm them

463
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:24,208
with modern...
PICARD:
We can't do that.

464
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,917
If we send that ship back
with new technology,

465
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,417
we'll be altering the past.

466
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,542
RIKER:
But that's what you're
talking about anyway,

467
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:29,875
isn't it-- altering the past?

468
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,291
We're talking
about restoring the past.

469
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,458
But how could Guinan know
that history's been altered

470
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
if she's been altered
along with the rest of us?

471
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,250
Perhaps her species
has a perception

472
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,041
that goes beyond
linear time.

473
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,792
PICARD:
There are many things
about her species

474
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,417
we can't easily explain.

475
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,417
Yet, it is very possible
that she is correct.

476
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:49,083
A ship from the past
has traveled through time.

477
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,750
How can we know
what effect those events

478
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,041
will have on the present?

479
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,917
Indeed, we shall never
know for certain

480
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,500
if Guinan is correct,

481
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:58,291
but I have decided the
consequences of that possibility

482
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,083
are too grave to ignore.

483
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,667
Dismissed.

484
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,500
RIKER:
Sir, if you'd
like my opinion...

485
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:06,834
I think I'm aware
of your opinion, Commander.

486
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:07,875
This is a briefing.

487
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,417
I'm not seeking your consent.

488
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,041
With all due respect, sir

489
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:15,000
you'd be asking 125 people
to die a meaningless death.

490
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,792
DATA:
Not necessarily
meaningless, Commander.

491
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:19,500
The Klingons regard honor
above all else.

492
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:21,834
If the crew
of the<i> Enterprise-C</i> had died

493
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:24,250
fighting for the survival
of a Klingon outpost,

494
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,417
it would be considered
a meaningful act of honor

495
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,917
by the Klingon Empire.

496
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,917
Even their deaths could have
prevented this war.

497
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,583
If the<i> Enterprise-C</i>
returns to the battle

498
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,291
and its mission is a success,

499
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,333
history will be
irrevocably changed.

500
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,542
This timeline will
cease to exist,

501
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,625
and a new future will
have been created.

502
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,291
I've considered
the alternatives.

503
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,834
I'll go with Guinan's
recommendation.

504
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,083
Dismissed.

505
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:52,625
If she's right,
we may not even<i> be</i>

506
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:53,792
in an alternate timeline.

507
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,875
Who knows if we're
even dead or alive?

508
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:12,375
Engineering.

509
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,583
Is Engineering your
destination as well?

510
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,250
What?

511
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,083
Oh, deck six.

512
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:20,458
Sorry.

513
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:24,166
(<i> lift whirring</i> )

514
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,083
If I interpret your facial
expressions correctly,

515
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:30,291
you are preoccupied
with something unpleasant.

516
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,000
No, I...

517
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:35,625
I was just thinking...
about a lot of things.

518
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

519
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:41,000
I've-I've been working
with one of the officers

520
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,834
on the<i> Enterprise-C.</i>

521
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:43,875
You know, he's-he's nice.

522
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,291
I like him.

523
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,667
I'm worried about what's
going to happen to him.

524
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:50,083
We may never know
what happens.

525
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,458
If they succeed,
we will not even realize

526
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,458
that these events occurred.

527
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,417
Shields are
up to 72%.

528
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,125
That's better.
Good.

529
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,500
GARRETT:
Do you believe this Guinan?

530
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,208
I discovered long ago

531
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,792
that she has
a special wisdom.

532
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,750
I've learned to trust it.

533
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:22,000
I could arrange for you
to speak with her, if you wish.

534
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:26,375
Captain, I would be lying
to you if I told you

535
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:29,500
there was a chance in hell
of coming out of this alive.

536
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:33,041
Why doesn't your ship
come back with us?

537
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,417
The Romulans would be
no match for your weaponry.

538
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:36,959
I can't do that.

539
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,834
No, I suppose not.

540
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:42,500
You don't belong in our time

541
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:45,625
any more than we belong
in yours.

542
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:47,375
To be honest
with you, Picard...

543
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,583
a significant number
of my crew members

544
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:51,083
have expressed
the desire to return,

545
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,500
even knowing the odds.

546
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,834
Some, because they can't bear to
live without their loved ones...

547
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,291
some, because
they don't like the idea

548
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,417
of slipping out
in the middle of a fight.

549
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:03,875
But I have told them

550
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:05,417
that, in the here and now,

551
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:09,417
the Federation needs another
ship against the Klingons...

552
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:12,750
and we'd better get used
to being in the here and now.

553
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:16,625
But, if you go back, it could be
a great deal more helpful.

554
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:20,375
(<i> crew members</i>
<i>conversing quietly</i> )

555
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,583
The war is going very badly
for the Federation.

556
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,834
Far worse than
is generally known.

557
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:28,875
Starfleet Command believes
that defeat is inevitable.

558
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,083
Within six months,

559
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,667
we may have no choice
but to surrender.

560
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,500
And you're saying
that all this

561
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:38,417
may be a result
of our arrival here?

562
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:42,250
One more ship will make no
difference in the here and now,

563
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,625
but, 22 years ago,

564
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,709
one ship could have
stopped this war

565
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,959
before it started.

566
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,458
Mr. Castillo.

567
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
CASTILLO:
Yes, Captain.

568
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,542
Inform the crew
we're going back.

569
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,625
Yes, Captain.

570
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,000
The Romulans will
get a good fight.

571
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:07,625
We'll make it one
for the history books.

572
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,125
I know you will, Captain.

573
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,000
Lieutenant Yar.

574
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,375
Permission to remain
a moment, sir.

575
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:19,792
Granted.

576
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,250
GARRETT:
Transporter room,

577
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:25,333
Captain Picard is ready
to return to his ship.

578
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,875
CREWMAN:
Aye, Captain.

579
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,500
I just wanted
to say good luck.

580
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:35,208
I'll try to put some
of your tactical briefing

581
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,375
to good use
when we get back.

582
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:39,166
Your ship has much
more maneuverability

583
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,000
than the Romulan
counterparts
of that era.

584
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,417
Actually, if you
could just isolate...

585
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,875
You'll do fine.

586
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,500
If you get back to Earth

587
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,417
and you see a man...

588
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,125
say, in his late 50s,

589
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:02,917
taking a hard, long look
across a crowded room...

590
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,959
Hey, you never know.

591
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,000
Good-bye, Lieutenant.

592
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,542
(explosion)
Whoa!

593
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:19,959
GARRETT:
Red Alert.
Full power to shields.

594
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,125
Shields are up.

595
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,458
Functioning.

596
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,792
Initiating evasive maneuvers,
Gamma sequence.

597
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,583
Ready phasers.

598
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,041
<i>Enterprise-D,</i> has your Captain

599
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,083
returned safely?

600
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,208
RIKER:
Acknowledged.

601
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,667
Captain Picard is safely aboard.

602
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:32,875
Fire phasers.

603
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:34,000
DATA:
Firing phasers.

604
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,333
(<i> sound of phaser blips</i> )

605
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:37,667
Report.

606
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:40,583
One Klingon bird-of-prey
off the starboard bow.

607
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,500
Firing phasers.

608
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:48,667
Load torpedo bays.

609
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,709
(<i> shouts</i> )

610
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,375
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

611
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,750
The Klingon vessel
has re-cloaked, sir.

612
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,125
I have no readings.

613
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,250
Captain Garrett, damage report.

614
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,083
PICARD:
Captain Garrett?!

615
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,792
This is Lieutenant Yar, sir.

616
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,417
Captain Garrett is dead.

617
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:29,625
I'm prepared to lead
the<i> Enterprise</i> back myself,

618
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:30,875
Captain Picard.

619
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,417
Sir, Lieutenant Castillo

620
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,583
is the last surviving
senior officer.

621
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:37,166
He will have limited support
from ops, no tactical,

622
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,166
reduced staff
in Engineering...

623
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,875
I have good people
willing to do their best.

624
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:44,000
Certainly, history never
meant for this ship

625
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:45,709
to go into battle
without her Captain.

626
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,500
I can't speak to
that point, sir,

627
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:51,125
but I can get us back
to where we're supposed to be.

628
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:53,583
I believe that's what Captain
Garrett would want me to do.

629
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,750
DATA: Commander Data
to Captain Picard.

630
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:56,792
Go ahead.

631
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,083
Sir, sensors are showing

632
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,333
additional instability
in the time rift,

633
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:03,834
possibly the result
of the battle with the Klingons.

634
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,250
Any signs of other
Klingon vessels?

635
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:06,500
No, sir.

636
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:07,875
Our coordinates
have been transmitted

637
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:09,500
to the Klingon
Command, sir.

638
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:10,834
We mustn't remain here.

639
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,208
CASTILLO:
Sir, it is my intention
to return,

640
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,041
unless you order me not to.

641
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,375
How soon can your ship
be ready?

642
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:22,375
We sustained moderate damage
in the attack.

643
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:24,083
I think we can
get underway in a few hours.

644
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,333
Make it so.
We'll give you cover.

645
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,625
MAN:
...meet him down in the docking
area on the double.

646
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,083
One to beam
to the<i> Enterprise-C.</i>

647
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:42,500
We keep saying good-bye,
don't we?

648
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,250
I wish we had more time.

649
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:47,792
More time?

650
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:50,834
I think we have all the time
we can handle as it is.

651
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,667
Lieutenant.

652
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:36,959
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

653
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,917
Can I get you something, Tasha?

654
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:44,834
Guinan, I have
to know something.

655
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,083
What happens to me
in the other timeline?

656
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:51,583
I don't have alternate
biographies of the crew.

657
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,333
As I said to the Captain,

658
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:57,208
it's just a feeling.

659
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,166
But there's something more
when you look at me,

660
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,375
isn't there?

661
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:04,417
I can see it in
your eyes, Guinan.

662
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:05,750
We've known each
other too long.

663
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:08,166
We weren't meant to know
each other at all.

664
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:11,333
At least, that's what I sense
when I look at you.

665
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:19,000
Tasha, you're not supposed
to be here.

666
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,542
Where am I supposed to be?

667
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:23,959
Dead.

668
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:29,375
Do you know how?

669
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,166
No.

670
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,875
But I do know
it was an empty death--

671
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:36,750
a death without purpose.

672
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,709
(<i> door chime</i> )

673
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,166
PICARD:
Come.

674
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,500
Yes, Lieutenant?

675
00:34:57,166 --> 00:35:01,125
Captain, I request a transfer
to the<i> Enterprise-C.</i>

676
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,542
For what reason?

677
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,792
They need someone
at tactical.

678
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:11,417
We need you here.

679
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,500
I'm not supposed
to be here, sir.

680
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,959
Sit down, Lieutenant.

681
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,500
What did she say to you?

682
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:35,166
I don't belong here, sir.

683
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm, I'm...
supposed to be dead.

684
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:47,083
She felt it necessary
to reveal that to you?

685
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,417
I felt it was necessary.

686
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,625
I see.

687
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,250
You realize
that it is very possible

688
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,667
the<i> Enterprise-C</i> will fail.

689
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:02,792
We will continue
in this timeline.

690
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:04,834
In which case,

691
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:08,125
your life, hopefully,

692
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,750
will continue for a long while.

693
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,834
I know how important it is
that they don't fail, Captain.

694
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,291
That's why I'm requesting
this transfer.

695
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,500
You don't belong
on that ship, Lieutenant.

696
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,166
No, Captain Garrett
belongs on that ship,

697
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,583
but she's dead.

698
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,291
And I think there's a certain
logic in this request.

699
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,458
There's no logic
in this at all!

700
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:30,917
Whether they succeed or not...

701
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,959
...the<i> Enterprise-C</i>
will be destroyed.

702
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,208
But, Captain,

703
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,291
at least with someone
at tactical,

704
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:45,208
they will have a chance
to defend themselves well.

705
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,709
It may be a matter
of seconds or minutes,

706
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,834
but those could be the minutes
that change history.

707
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,667
Guinan says
I died a senseless death

708
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:54,959
in the other timeline.

709
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,458
I didn't like the sound
of that, Captain.

710
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,667
I've always known the risks

711
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:05,083
that come
