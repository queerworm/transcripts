I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND
THE BLACK SEA AT NIGHT

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,472
TO BE A MOST
STIMULATING EXPERIENCE.

IS "STIMULATING"?

IT WAS...

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,243
VERY STIMULATING.

12
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,955
WHAT?

13
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,292
YOU KNOW, I DON'T SPEND NEARLY
ENOUGH TIME ON THE HOLODECK.

14
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,963
I SHOULD TAKE MY OWN ADVICE
AND GO THERE TO RELAX.

15
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,382

CHOOSE THE PROGRAM.

NO.

BUT I DO NOT WISH...

23
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,900

180
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,870
I JUST FINISHED
THE NEUROGRAPHIC SCAN.

181
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,166
I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING
THAT WOULD CAUSE HALLUCINATIONS

182
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,792
OR A PSYCHOGENIC REACTION.

183
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,837
IS THERE ANY INDICATION
OF TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT?

184
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,464
NO. USUALLY A TEMPORAL SHIFT

185
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,591
WOULD LEAVE SOME SORT OF
TRYPTAMINE RESIDUE

186
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,468
IN THE CEREBRAL CORTEX, BUT THE
SCAN DIDN'T SHOW ANY.

187
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,886
PERSONALLY, I THINK YOU JUST
ENJOY WAKING EVERYBODY UP

188
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,763
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

189
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,601
ACTUALLY, I REALLY LIKE RUNNING
AROUND THE SHIP IN MY BARE FEET.

190
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,397
THE BIOSPECTRAL
TEST RESULTS, DOCTOR.

191
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:33,401
YOUR BLOOD GAS ANALYSIS
IS CONSISTENT WITH SOMEONE

192
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,237
WHO'S BEEN BREATHING
THE SHIP'S AIR FOR WEEKS.

193
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,822
IF YOU'D BEEN
ANYWHERE ELSE

194
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,533
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
AN INDICATION OF CHANGE

195
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:43,537
IN THE OXYGEN
ISOTOPE RATIOS.

196
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,038
THANKS.

197
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,375
DEANNA, WOULD YOU
EXCUSE US, PLEASE?

198
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,127
OF COURSE.

199
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,841
JEAN-LUC, I SCANNED YOU

200
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,177
FOR EVIDENCE
OF IRUMODIC SYNDROME

201
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,554
AS YOU SUGGESTED.

202
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,348
THERE WASN'T ANY.

203
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,350
BUT I DID FIND

204
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,062
A SMALL STRUCTURAL DEFECT
IN THE PARIETAL LOBE.

205
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,650
A DEFECT THAT YOU
HADN'T NOTICED BEFORE?

206
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,653
IT'S THE KIND OF DEFECT
THAT WOULD ONLY SHOW UP

207
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,697
ON A LEVEL-FOUR
NEUROGRAPHIC SCAN

208
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,115
THAT COULD CAUSE YOU
TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE

209
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,701
TO SEVERAL KINDS OF NEUROLOGICAL
DISORDERS

210
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,412
INCLUDING
IRUMODIC SYNDROME.

211
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,997
NOW IT'S POSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO LIVE WITH THIS DEFECT

212
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,000
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
WITHOUT DEVELOPING A PROBLEM

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,211
OR EVEN IF YOU DO,
MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE

214
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,255
TO LIVE NORMAL LIVES
FOR A LONG TIME

215
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,424
AFTER THE ONSET
OF IRUMODIC SYNDROME.

216
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,967
IF THAT'S SO, WHY DO YOU LOOK
AS IF YOU'VE JUST SIGNED

217
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,678
MY DEATH SENTENCE?

218
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,514
I'M SORRY.

219
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,934
I GUESS...
IT CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD.

220
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,936
I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

221
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,147
SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

222
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,067
TO PUT UP WITH ME
FOR A LONG TIME TO COME.

223
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,986
WELL, IT WON'T BE EASY,
BUT I'LL MANAGE.

224
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,281
( door slides open )
Riker: CAPTAIN.

225
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,575
HAS WORF FOUND ANYTHING?

226
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,202
NO, SIR. HIS SECURITY SCANS
CAME UP NEGATIVE.

227
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,496
THEY'RE STILL CHECKING
THE SENSOR LOGS

228
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,081
BUT THERE IS
NO INDICATION

229
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,999
THAT YOU EVER
LEFT THE SHIP.

230
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,251
I WASN'T DREAMING.

231
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,586
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

232
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,921
<i>Worf to Captain.</i> 
GO AHEAD, MR. WORF.

233
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,633
<i>Sir, there is</i>
<i>an incoming transmission</i>

234
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,925
<i>from Admiral Nakamura.</i>

235
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,469
<i>It is a priority one message.</i>

236
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,678
BEVERLY?

237
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,306
MR. WORF,
WILL YOU ROUTE THE CALL

238
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,807
THROUGH TO DR. CRUSHER'S OFFICE?

239
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,018
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

240
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,021
Nakamura:
<i>Captain.</i>

241
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,440
ADMIRAL.

242
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,525
<i>I am initiating</i>
<i>a fleet-wide yellow alert.</i>

243
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,527
<i>Starfleet intelligence</i>
<i>has picked up</i>

244
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,738
<i>some alarming reports</i>
<i>from the Romulan Empire.</i>

245
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,364
<i>It appears that at least</i>

246
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,117
<i>30 Warbirds have been pulled</i>
<i>from other assignments</i>

247
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,119
<i>and are headed</i>
<i>for the Neutral Zone.</i>

248
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,538
IS THERE ANY EXPLANATION
WHY THEY WOULD MAKE

249
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,123
SUCH A BLATANTLY
AGGRESSIVE MOVE?

250
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,375
<i>Our operatives on Romulus</i>
<i>have indicated</i>

251
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,336
<i>that there appears</i>
<i>to be something happening</i>

252
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,712
<i>in the Neutral Zone</i>

253
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,838
<i>specifically</i>
<i>in the Devron System.</i>

254
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,341
<i>Our own long-range scans</i>

255
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,010
<i>picked up some spatial anomaly</i>
<i>in the area.</i>

256
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,553
<i>We can't tell what it is.</i>

257
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,845
WHAT ARE OUR ORDERS?

258
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,140
<i>This is a very</i>
<i>delicate situation.</i>

259
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,101
<i>I'm deploying 15 starships</i>
<i>along our side</i>

260
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,728
<i>of the Neutral Zone.</i>

261
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,063
<i>I want you to go there as well.</i>

262
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,150
<i>See if you can find out</i>
<i>what is going on</i>

263
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,819
<i>in the Devron System.</i>

264
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,697
AM I AUTHORIZED
TO ENTER THE NEUTRAL ZONE?

265
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,031
<i>Not yet.</i>

266
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,866
<i>Wait and see</i>
<i>what the Romulans do.</i>

267
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,076
<i>You can conduct</i>
<i>long-range scans,</i>

268
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,745
<i>send probes if necessary,</i>

269
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,497
<i>but do not cross the border</i>

270
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,207
<i>unless they do.</i>

271
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,500
UNDERSTOOD.

272
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,917
<i>Starfleet out.</i>

273
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,294
( computer beeps )

274
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,300
CAPTAIN...

275
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,387
WHAT'S WRONG?

276
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,307
THIS IS NOT MY TIME.

277
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,644
I DON'T BELONG HERE.

278
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,936
WHAT?

279
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,398
I WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE
A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

280
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,566
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

281
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,651
YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT HERE
WITH ME.

282
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,653
NO! NO! NO!

283
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,739
I WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE.

284
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,534
I WAS... IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

285
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,494
THERE WAS SOMEONE TALKING.

286
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,415
I WAS... I-I...
I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE.

287
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,916
BEVERLY.

288
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,543
I WAS TALKING TO BEVERLY.

289
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,836
IT'S OKAY, CAPTAIN.

290
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,255
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

291
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,048
I'M NOT SENILE, YOU KNOW.

292
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,383
THIS DID HAPPEN.

293
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,134
I-I-I WAS HERE

294
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,804
I WAS TALKING TO YOU,
AND THEN...

295
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,890
AND THEN I WAS
SOMEWHERE ELSE

296
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,100
I WAS, UH...

297
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,060
I WAS ON THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

298
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,020
I WAS BACK ON THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

299
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,608
AT LEAST I... I THINK
THAT'S WHERE IT WAS.

300
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,526
I WAS IN SICK BAY.

301
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,195
WELL, IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN A HOSPITAL.

302
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,323
CAPTAIN, I THINK WE
SHOULD GO BACK TO THE HOUSE

303
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,700
AND CALL YOUR DOCTOR.

304
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,119
YES, YES, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

305
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,871
IT'S THE IRUMODIC SYNDROME.

306
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,665
HE'S BEGINNING TO LOSE HIS MIND,
THE OLD MAN.

307
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,168
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT,
AND I'M NOT DAYDREAMING EITHER.

308
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,129
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

309
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,422
ALL RIGHT.

310
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,509
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO ABOUT IT?

311
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,511
DATA.

312
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,472
I WANT TO SEE DATA.

313
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,723
DATA-- WHY?

314
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,558
'CAUSE I THINK
HE CAN HELP.

315
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,768
HELP HOW?

316
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,436
I DON'T KNOW!
I DON'T KNOW!

317
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,522
I WANT TO SEE DATA.

318
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,816
OKAY, THEN.

319
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,192
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO SEE DATA.

320
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,028
HE'S STILL AT CAMBRIDGE,
ISN'T HE?

321
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,740
YES, I-I THINK HE IS.

322
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,536
( shouting indistinctly )

323
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,551
YOU SEE THEM, DON'T YOU?

324
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,428
SEE WHO?

325
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,598
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

326
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,600
THEY'RE LAUGHING AT ME.

327
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,059
WHY ARE THEY LAUGHING?

328
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,728
COME ON, CAPTAIN.

329
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,730
LET'S GO SEE DATA.

330
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,818
YES.

331
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,486
DATA.

332
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,488
WE'LL GO SEE DATA.

333
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,207
I KNOW HOW IT SOUNDS,
BUT IT HAPPENED.

334
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,625
IT WAS REAL.

335
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,670
I WAS THERE, BACK ONBOARD
THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

336
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,714
HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR TEA?

337
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,298
TEA? EARL GREY. HOT.

338
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,550
OF COURSE IT'S HOT.

339
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,092
WHAT DO YOU WANT IN IT?

340
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,469
NOTHING.

341
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,972
WELL, DATA,
I MUST SAY

342
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,224
THIS IS A FINE PLACE
YOU HAVE HERE.

343
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,768
THEY CERTAINLY TREAT
PROFESSORS VERY WELL

344
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,269
AT CAMBRIDGE.

345
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,648
HOLDING A LUCASIAN CHAIR
DOES HAVE ITS PERQUISITES.

346
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,567
THIS HOUSE ORIGINALLY BELONGED

347
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,986
TO SIR ISAAC NEWTON
WHEN HE HELD THE POSITION.

348
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,530
IT'S BECOME
THE TRADITIONAL RESIDENCE.

349
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,032
HERE YOU GO.

350
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,449
THANK YOU.

351
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,368
IF YOU'RE REALLY
HIS FRIEND

352
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,787
YOU'LL GET HIM
TO TAKE THAT GRAY

353
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,039
OUT OF HIS HAIR.

354
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,164
JESSEL...

355
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,208
LOOKS LIKE
A BLOODY SKUNK.

356
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,004
SHE CAN BE FRIGHTFULLY TRYING
AT TIMES

357
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,631
BUT SHE DOES
MAKE ME LAUGH.

358
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,220
DATA, WHAT IS IT
WITH THE HAIR ANYWAY?

359
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,183
I FOUND THAT A TOUCH OF GRAY
ADDS AN AIR OF... DISTINCTION.

360
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,435
YOU SAID THIS IS EARL GREY?

361
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,353
I'D SWEAR THAT
IT WAS DARJEELING.

362
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:31,110
CAPTAIN, HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOU'VE SEEN A DOCTOR

363
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,571
ABOUT YOUR
IRUMODIC SYNDROME?

364
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,573
A WEEK.

365
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,868
THEY PRESCRIBED PERIDAXON.

366
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,037
Data:
BUT, SIR, PERIDAXON...

367
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,997
YES I KNOW-- IT'S NOT A CURE.

368
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,207
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN PREVENT

369
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,168
THE DETERIORATION
OF THE SYNAPTIC PATHWAYS.

370
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,754
YOU THINK THAT I'M SENILE

371
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,965
THAT ALL THIS
IS JUST A DELUSION.

372
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,718
NOW, COME ON, CAPTAIN, NO ONE
SAID ANYTHING OF THE KIND.

373
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,553
IN ALL HONESTY, CAPTAIN

374
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,180
THE THOUGHT
HAS OCCURRED TO ME.

375
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,433
HOWEVER

376
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:06,395
THERE'S NOTHING
TO DISPROVE WHAT YOUR SAYING.

377
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:11,776
SO IT'S POSSIBLE
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO YOU.

378
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:16,155
THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD DO
IS RUN A COMPLETE SERIES

379
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,491
OF NEUROGRAPHIC SCANS.

380
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,326
WE CAN USE THE EQUIPMENT
IN THE BIOMETRIC LAB

381
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,953
HERE ON THE CAMPUS.

382
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,705
JESSEL, ASK PROFESSOR RIPPERT
TO TAKE OVER MY LECTURE

383
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,084
FOR TOMORROW, POSSIBLY
FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.

384
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,629
CAPTAIN, WE'LL GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

385
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,798
THAT'S THE DATA
THAT I REMEMBER.

386
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,635
I KNEW THAT I COULD
COUNT ON YOU.

387
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,306
COMMANDING OFFICER,

388
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,642
<i>ENTERPRISE</i> ARRIVING.

389
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,185
( shrill tone )

390
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:01,701
"TO CAPTAIN JEAN-LUC PICARD,
STARDATE 41148...

391
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,327
( angry shouting )

392
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:17,008
"...YOU ARE HEREBY REQUESTED
AND REQUIRED TO TAKE COMMAND...

393
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,759
( indistinct shouting )

394
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,934
"...TO TAKE... COMMAND
OF THE U.S.S.<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

395
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,435
"AS OF THIS DATE.

396
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:32,023
SIGNED REAR ADMIRAL NORAL SATIE,
STARFLEET COMMAND."

397
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,280
( all shouting angrily )

398
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,248
RED ALERT!

399
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,500
ALL CREW TO BATTLE STATIONS!

400
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,587
Tasha:
YOU HEARD HIM.

401
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,796
MOVE!

402
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,297
( alarm blaring )

403
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:22,406
Picard:
<i>PERSONAL LOG, STARDATE 41153.7.</i>

404
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,659
<i>RECORDED UNDER SECURITY LOCKOUT</i>
<i>OMEGA 327.</i>

405
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:30,372
<i>I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO INFORM</i>
<i>THIS CREW OF MY EXPERIENCES.</i>

406
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,583
<i>IF IT'S TRUE</i>
<i>THAT I'VE TRAVELED TO THE PAST,</i>

407
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,835
<i>I CANNOT RISK GIVING THEM</i>
<i>FOREKNOWLEDGE</i>

408
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,670
<i>OF WHAT'S TO COME.</i>

409
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,512
REPORT.

410
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,057
WE'VE COMPLETED
A FULL SUBSPACE SCAN

411
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,976
OF THE SHIP
AND SURROUNDING SPACE.

412
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:53,437
WE'VE DETECTED NO UNUSUAL
READINGS OR ANOMALIES.

413
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,231
Worf:
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,

414
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,565
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL
IF WE KNEW

415
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,984
EXACTLY WHAT
WE WERE LOOKING FOR.

416
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,986
NOTED.

417
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,029
COUNSELOR, DO YOU SENSE
ANYTHING UNUSUAL

418
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,697
ONBOARD THE<i> ENTERPRISE?</i>

419
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,784
PERHAPS AN ALIEN PRESENCE
THAT DOESN'T BELONG HERE--

420
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,870
MAYBE ONE OPERATING
ON A LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE

421
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,164
FAR SUPERIOR TO OUR OWN?

422
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,498
NO, SIR. I'M ONLY AWARE

423
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,333
OF THE CREW
AND THE FAMILIES

424
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,876
ONBOARD THE SHIP.

425
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,755
MR. WORF, INITIATE A LEVEL TWO
SECURITY ALERT,

426
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,590
ALL DECKS,
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

427
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,217
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,

428
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,012
I'M THE SECURITY CHIEF
ON THIS SHIP.

429
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,140
UNLESS... YOU'RE PLANNING
TO MAKE A CHANGE.

430
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,350
NO, UH... OF COURSE NOT.

431
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,021
LIEUTENANT, SECURITY ALERT TWO.

432
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,480
AYE, SIR.

433
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,398
O'Brien:
<i>Captain Picard to the bridge.</i>

434
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,151
WE'RE ON OUR WAY, CHIEF.

435
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,741
SIR, STARFLEET
JUST ISSUED AN ALERT.

436
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,993
IT APPEARS A NUMBER OF VESSELS

437
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,368
ARE MOVING TOWARD
THE NEUTRAL ZONE

438
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,205
BETWEEN ROMULAN
AND FEDERATION SPACE.

439
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,622
WHAT KIND OF VESSELS?

440
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,291
FREIGHTERS, TRANSPORT.
ALL CIVILIANS,

441
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,460
NONE OF THEM
STARFLEET SHIPS.

442
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,587
THIS TELLS ME
THAT A LARGE SPATIAL ANOMALY

443
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,257
HAS APPEARED
IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE

444
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,343
IN THE DEVRON SYSTEM.

445
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,928
CAPTAIN, IT COULD BE
A ROMULAN TRICK

446
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,638
TO LURE OUR SHIPS
INTO THE NEUTRAL ZONE

447
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,516
AS AN EXCUSE
FOR A MILITARY STRIKE.

448
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,102
STARFLEET'S CANCELING
OUR MISSION TO FARPOINT STATION

449
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,520
AND ORDERING US
TO THE NEUTRAL ZONE,

450
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,938
AS SOON AS WE LEAVE
THE SPACE DOCK.

451
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,066
NO, WE'LL PROCEED TO FARPOINT.

452
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,901
SIR?

453
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,736
YOU HEARD ME.

454
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,403
CAPTAIN, THE SECURITY
OF THE FEDERATION

455
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,739
COULD BE AT STAKE.

456
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,075
MR. WORF, WILL YOU
MAN YOUR STATION.

457
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,534
AYE, SIR.

458
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,579
CAPTAIN, PERHAPS IF WE
UNDERSTOOD YOUR THINKING,

459
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,914
IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN...

460
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,208
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF EXPLAINING TO ANYONE.

461
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,001
WE WILL PROCEED WITH OUR MISSION
TO FARPOINT AS PLANNED.

462
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,836
CHIEF O'BRIEN,
AM I RIGHT IN THINKING

463
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,713
THAT ARE YOU HAVING A PROBLEM
WITH THE WARP PLASMA INDUCERS?

464
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,422
THAT'S RIGHT, SIR.

465
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,550
WELL, I KNOW HOW TO GET THEM
BACK ONLINE. YOU'RE WITH ME.

466
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,012
WE'LL BE IN
MAIN ENGINEERING.

467
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,645
MR. O'BRIEN, WILL YOU USE
THESE SPECIFICATIONS

468
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,480
TO BYPASS THE SECONDARY
PLASMA INDUCER?

469
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,857
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE, SIR

470
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,859
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
MY AREA OF EXPERTISE.

471
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,069
THE CHIEF ENGINEER

472
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,528
SHOULD BE MAKING
THESE MODIFICATIONS.

473
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,282
BUT THE CHIEF ENGINEER
ISN'T ONBOARD.

474
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,991
MR. O'BRIEN, TRUST ME.

475
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,869
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

476
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,246
ALL THOSE YEARS
YOU SPENT AS A CHILD

477
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,998
BUILDING THOSE MODEL
STARSHIP ENGINES

478
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,084
THEY WERE WELL WORTH IT.

479
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,795
HOW DID YOU
KNOW THAT, SIR?

480
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,423
FROM YOUR STARFLEET RECORDS.

481
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:26,840
YES, SIR.

482
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,717
I'LL GET RIGHT
TO THESE MODIFICATIONS.

483
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,553
FLETCHER, TELL MUNOZ AND LEE
TO GET UP HERE RIGHT AWAY.

484
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,972
AYE, SIR.

485
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,433
WE HAVE TO REALIGN THE ENTIRE
POWER GRID.

486
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,475
WE'LL ALL BE BURNING
THE MIDNIGHT OIL ON THIS ONE.

487
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,477
THAT WOULD BE INADVISABLE.

488
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,064
EXCUSE ME?

489
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,941
IF YOU ATTEMPT TO IGNITE
A PETROLEUM PRODUCT

490
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,777
ON THIS SHIP AT 00:00 HOURS,
YOU WILL ACTIVATE

491
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,237
THE FIRE
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM

492
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,614
WHICH WOULD SEAL OFF
THIS ENTIRE COMPARTMENT.

493
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,699
O'Brien:
THAT WAS JUST AN EXPRESSION.

494
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,327
Data:
EXPRESSION OF WHAT?

495
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,203
O'Brien:
A FIGURE OF SPEECH.

496
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,790
I WAS TRYING TO TELL HIM
THAT WE'D BE WORKING LATE.

497
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,419
AH. THEN "TO BURN THE MIDNIGHT
OIL" IMPLIES LATE WORK.

498
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,338
THAT'S RIGHT.

499
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,755
HMM. I AM CURIOUS.

500
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,383
WHAT IS THE ETYMOLOGY
OF THAT IDIOM?

501
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,885
HOW DID IT
COME TO BE USED

502
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,179
IN CONTEMPORARY
LANGUAGE?

503
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,431
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

504
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:19,101
COMMANDER DATA,
WELCOME ONBOARD.

505
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,313
IT'S SO VERY GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

506
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,106
IT IS GOOD TO SEE
YOU, TOO, SIR.

507
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,984
I COULD USE YOUR HELP
WITH THE INFUSER ARRAY.

508
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,319
CERTAINLY.

509
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,158
AS YOU CAN SEE,
WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS

510
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,701
WITH THE PLASMA CONDUITS.

511
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,662
THIS WILL NEED

512
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,748
A COMPLETELY NEW
FIELD INDUCTION SUBPROCESSOR.

513
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,084
IT APPEARS WE WILL BE REQUIRED

514
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,462
TO IGNITE
THE MIDNIGHT PETROLEUM, SIR.

515
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,840
Beverly:
JEAN-LUC, WHAT'S GOING ON?

516
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,346
IT HAPPENED AGAIN.

517
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,972
THE TIME SHIFT?

518
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,265
YEAH.

519
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,184
WHAT HAPPENED?

520
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,478
IT'S STILL A LITTLE VAGUE

521
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,689
BUT I CAN REMEMBER MORE
THIS TIME.

522
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,527
IT SEEMS THAT EVERY TIME
I SHIFT PERIODS

523
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,153
I CAN RETAIN MORE MEMORY.

524
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,281
AT FIRST, IT APPEARED
THAT I WAS IN THE FUTURE--

525
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,908
YEARS FROM NOW--

526
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,160
AND THEN,
I WAS IN THE PAST

527
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,787
JUST BEFORE
OUR FIRST MISSION.

528
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,289
WHAT IS IT?

529
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,292
I JUST SCANNED HIS TEMPORAL LOBE
AND COMPARED IT

530
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,837
WITH THE SCAN I PERFORMED
JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE.

531
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,214
THERE'S A 13 PERCENT INCREASE

532
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,799
IN THE ACETYLCHOLINE
OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS.

533
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,592
WITHIN A MATTER
OF MINUTES

534
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,844
YOU HAVE ACCUMULATED

535
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,097
OVER TWO DAYS' WORTH
OF MEMORIES.

536
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,688
COUNSELOR,
DO YOU REMEMBER

537
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,232
WHEN I FIRST CAME
ONBOARD THE<i> ENTERPRISE?</i>

538
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,649
YES.

539
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,985
WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THE WELCOMING CEREMONY?

540
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,987
THERE WAS A RECEPTION
IN TEN FORWARD.

541
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,074
I INTRODUCED YOU TO WORF
AND THE OTHER SENIOR OFFICERS.

542
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:00,286
DO YOU HAVE ANY MEMORY
OF MY CALLING RED ALERT

543
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,579
IN THE SPACE DOCK?

544
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,996
DO YOU REMEMBER STARFLEET
DIVERTING US

545
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,790
FROM FARPOINT
TO THE NEUTRAL ZONE

546
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,666
TO INVESTIGATE
A SPATIAL ANOMALY?

547
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,168
NO.

548
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,004
Data:
IT WOULD APPEAR
THERE IS A DISCONTINUITY

549
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,923
BETWEEN THE TIME PERIODS YOU
DESCRIBED.

550
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:16,093
EVENTS IN ONE TIME PERIOD WOULD
HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE OTHER TWO.

551
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,011
YET IN BOTH
THE PAST AND THE PRESENT

552
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,722
THERE IS A REPORT OF THE SAME
ANOMALY IN THE DEVRON SYSTEM.

553
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,558
I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE.

554
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,352
FOR ALL I KNOW I MAY FIND THE
SAME THING IN THE FUTURE.

555
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,686
PERHAPS THE ANOMALY

556
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,481
IS A TEMPORAL DISTURBANCE
OF SOME KIND.

557
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:31,484
HOW IS ALL THIS RELATED
TO YOUR TIME SHIFTING?

558
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,320
THESE ARE ALL
VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

559
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,823
AND PERHAPS I WILL FIND
ANSWERS TO THEM IN THE PAST

560
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,950
BUT NOW, WE HAVE
A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS THREAT

561
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,494
FROM THE ROMULANS.

562
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,744
I WANT ALL DEPARTMENTS
TO PRESENT

563
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,413
A BATTLE READINESS
REPORT TO ME

564
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,915
AT 0800 HOURS
TOMORROW MORNING. DISMISSED.

565
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,835
Riker:
DEANNA...

566
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,044
IT'S GOING TO BE A LATE NIGHT.

567
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,712
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE
SOME DINNER?

568
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,131
ACTUALLY, I...

569
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,551
WE HAVE PLANS.

570
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,261
OH, I SEE. I'M SORRY.

571
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,721
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

572
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,185
GOOD NIGHT, SIR.

573
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,395
WORF.

574
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,109
I WANT CONTINUAL
SUBSPACE SWEEPS.

575
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,237
WE MAY BE ABLE TO DETECT
A TEMPORAL DISTURBANCE.

576
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,489
AYE, SIR.

577
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,283
WILL...
THIS TIME SHIFTING--

578
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:25,954
WHEN IT HAPPENS, I EXPERIENCE
A MOMENTARY DISORIENTATION.

579
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,789
IF THAT SHOULD HAPPEN
DURING A CRISIS, WILL,

580
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,251
I WANT YOU TO TAKE COMMAND
IMMEDIATELY.

581
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,710
NUMBER ONE?

582
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,296
I'M SORRY.

583
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,965
BE PREPARED
TO TAKE COMMAND. AYE, SIR.

584
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,552
SPEAKING OF DISORIENTATION,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

585
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,928
I'M JUST A LITTLE DISTRACTED.

586
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,639
I'M FINE.

587
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:44,806
( sighs )

588
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,225
YOU HAVE THE BRIDGE,
NUMBER ONE.

589
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,144
I'LL... I'LL BE IN
MY READY ROOM.

590
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,069
( door chimes )

591
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,654
COME.

592
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,744
MILK, WARM.

593
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,204
A DASH OF NUTMEG.

594
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,039
WHAT'S THIS?

595
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,750
A PRESCRIPTION.

596
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,711
A GLASS OF WARM MILK

597
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,921
AND EIGHT HOURS'
UNINTERRUPTED SLEEP.

598
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,881
BEVERLY...

599
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,050
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

600
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,594
YOU'RE EXHAUSTED.

601
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,513
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
YOU SLEPT IN THE PAST

602
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,683
OR IN THE FUTURE,
BUT I'M SURE

603
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,560
YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN THE PRESENT.

604
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,478
NOW, GET SOME REST,
OR I'LL HAVE YOU RELIEVED

605
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,063
AND SEDATED.

606
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,856
YES, SIR.

607
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,446
WHAT?

608
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,365
HEY.

609
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,910
BEVERLY?

610
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,375
AS A PHYSICIAN,
IT'S OFTEN MY JOB

611
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,086
TO GIVE PEOPLE
UNPLEASANT NEWS--

612
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,879
TO TELL THEM
THAT THEY NEED SURGERY

613
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,506
OR THAT THEY CAN'T
HAVE CHILDREN

614
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:04,261
OR THAT THEY MIGHT BE FACING
A DIFFICULT ILLNESS.

615
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:07,473
BUT YOU SAID YOURSELF
THAT THIS IS ONLY A POSSIBILITY.

616
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,976
BUT YOU'VE BEEN TO THE FUTURE.

617
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,312
YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

618
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,897
I PREFER TO LOOK ON THE FUTURE

619
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:20,569
AS SOMETHING
WHICH IS NOT WRITTEN IN STONE.

620
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:24,657
A LOT OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN
IN 25 YEARS.

621
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,244
(<i> tender theme playing</i> )

622
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,757
A LOT OF THINGS
CAN HAPPEN.

623
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,514
( door hisses open and closed )

624
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,016
La Forge:
<i>CAPTAIN?</i>

625
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,435
YEAH?

626
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,354
La Forge:
CAPTAIN, WAKE UP.

627
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,523
YES.

628
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,693
WHAT IS IT?

629
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,278
HAVE WE REACHED
THE NEUTRAL ZONE?

630
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,864
La Forge:
THE NEUTRAL ZONE?

631
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:12,245
OH... I'M SORRY.

632
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,748
I WAS IN THE PAST AGAIN.

633
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,291
WHAT'S GOING ON?

634
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,001
DATA'S ARRANGED FOR US
TO RUN THOSE TESTS ON YOU

635
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,252
IN THE BIOMETRICS LAB.

636
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,880
WE'RE READY TO GO
IF YOU ARE.

637
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,423
NO, NO, NO, NO.

638
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,343
WE HAVE TO GET
TO THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

639
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,345
THE NEUTRAL ZONE? WHY?

640
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:31,390
IN THE OTHER
TWO TIME PERIODS

641
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,018
STARFLEET REPORTED... A...

642
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,187
A SORT OF A...

643
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:41,400
A SPATIAL ANOMALY
IN, IN, IN...

644
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,151
IN THE DEVRON SYSTEM.

645
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,739
IN THE DEVRON SYSTEM
IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

646
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,073
CAPTAIN...

647
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,784
IF THE ANOMALY
APPEARED THERE IN THE PAST

648
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,328
THEN IT MIGHT BE HERE TOO,
AND WE HAVE TO FIND OUT.

649
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,706
JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN IT
IN TWO OTHER TIME FRAMES

650
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,916
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
IT'S GOING TO BE HERE.

651
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,044
YEAH, BUT IF IT IS HERE,
THEN IT MEANS SOMETHING!

652
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,170
DAMN IT, GEORDI,

653
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,214
I KNOW
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO!

654
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,720
ALL RIGHT.

655
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,892
OKAY, BUT FIRST,
THERE IS NO NEUTRAL ZONE.

656
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,268
REMEMBER?

657
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,853
RIGHT.

658
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,606
RIGHT. KLINGONS.

659
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,566
IN THIS TIME PERIOD

660
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,861
THE KLINGONS HAVE TAKEN OVER
THE ROMULAN EMPIRE.

661
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,195
AND RIGHT NOW,
RELATIONS BETWEEN US

662
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,155
AND THE KLINGONS
AREN'T TOO COZY.

663
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,699
I KNOW THAT!

664
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,201
I HAVEN'T COMPLETELY
LOST MY MIND, YOU KNOW.

665
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,792
WELL, IF WE'RE GOING
TO THE DEVRON SYSTEM

666
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,836
WE'RE GOING TO NEED A SHIP.

667
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,756
( chuckling )

668
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,966
RIGHT.

669
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:54,807
NOW, I THINK IT'S TIME
TO CALL IN SOME OLD FAVORS.

670
00:32:54,807 --> 00:33:00,687
CONTACT... ADMIRAL RIKER,
STARBASE 247.

671
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,487
<i>Jean-Luc,</i>
<i>you know I'd like to help</i>

672
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,948
<i>but frankly, what you're asking</i>
<i>for is impossible.</i>

673
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:13,241
<i>The Klingons</i>
<i>have closed their borders</i>

674
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,868
<i>to all Federation starships.</i>

675
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,912
WILL, WHAT IF
THIS SPATIAL ANOMALY

676
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,705
REALLY IS IN THE DEVRON SYSTEM?

677
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,250
<i>I saw a report from Starfleet</i>
<i>Intelligence this morning</i>

678
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,543
<i>on that sector.</i>

679
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,253
<i>There is no activity.</i>

680
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:29,048
<i>There is nothing unusual</i>
<i>going on in the Devron System.</i>

681
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,425
WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

682
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,803
WHAT IF THEIR
LONG-RANGE SCANS ARE FAULTY?

683
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,180
WE HAVE TO GO THERE
AND SEE FOR OURSELVES.

684
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,975
<i>Look, I've got the</i> Yorktown
<i>out near the border.</i>

685
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,226
<i>I'll have her run</i>
<i>some long-range scans</i>

686
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,854
<i>on the Devron System.</i>

687
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,605
<i>If she finds out anything,</i>
<i>I'll let you know.</i>

688
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,565
WILL, THAT IS JUST NOT GOOD
ENOUGH.

689
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,400
<i>It's going to have to be.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

690
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,028
<i>It's all I can do.</i>
<i>Riker out.</i>

691
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,993
COMPUTER, RESTORE
HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE.

692
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,579
DAMN HIM ANYWAY.

693
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,499
AFTER ALL WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH TOGETHER.

694
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:06,252
HE'S BEEN SITTING
BEHIND THAT DESK TOO LONG.

695
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,838
CAPTAIN, I'M SORRY.

696
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:11,008
I GUESS ALL WE CAN DO NOW
IS WAIT AND SEE

697
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,510
IF THE<i> YORKTOWN</i>
FINDS ANYTHING.

698
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,303
THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION.

699
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,597
WE COULD
ARRANGE PASSAGE

700
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,807
ABOARD A MEDICAL SHIP.

701
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,642
MEDICAL SHIP?
YES, SIR.

702
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,687
THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK
OF TERRELLIAN PLAGUE ON ROMULUS.

703
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,772
THE KLINGONS HAVE BEEN ALLOWING
<i>FEDERATION</i> MEDICAL SHIPS

704
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,148
TO CROSS THE BORDER.

705
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,275
YES! YES!

706
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:33,405
SO, WHAT WE NEED NOW
IS A MEDICAL SHIP.

707
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,033
I THINK I CAN ARRANGE THAT.

708
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:41,413
DATA, FIND THE U.S.S.<i> PASTEUR.</i>
I...

709
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:46,084
I HAVE SOME PULL
WITH THE CAPTAIN.

710
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,546
AT LEAST, I USED TO HAVE.

711
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,798
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

712
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,305
( door hisses open )

713
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,856
WELL, THIS IS A PAGE
FROM THE PAST.

714
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,566
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE EITHER OF YOU

715
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,943
ON A STARSHIP AGAIN.

716
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,277
HELLO, DOCTOR.
GEORDI.

717
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,153
DOCTOR.
DATA.

718
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,615
UH...

719
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,076
( laughs )

720
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,160
LET'S JUST CHOOSE ONE.

721
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,288
ALL RIGHT.

722
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,625
SO DID YOU GET MY MESSAGE?

723
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,878
YES. JEAN-LUC, CROSSING
INTO KLINGON TERRITORY--

724
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:33,214
IT'S ABSURD, BUT THEN,
I NEVER COULD SAY NO TO YOU.

725
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,550
OH, SO THAT'S WHY
YOU MARRIED ME.

726
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,264
WELL, NOW,
THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS

727
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,766
IS TO GET CLEARANCE

728
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,018
TO CROSS
THE KLINGON BORDER.

729
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,937
AGREED. WHAT ABOUT WORF?

730
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:50,565
YES! THAT'S IT! WORF.

731
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,609
YES, THAT'S THE ANSWER.
WORF WILL HELP US.

732
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:55,904
DATA, ISN'T WORF STILL A MEMBER
OF THE KLINGON HIGH COUNCIL?

733
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,405
I'M NOT SURE.

734
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,283
INFORMATION ON THE KLINGON
POLITICAL STRUCTURE

735
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,285
IS HARD TO COME BY THESE DAYS.

736
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,998
HOWEVER, AT LAST REPORT,
WORF WAS GOVERNOR OF H'ATORIA

737
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,083
A SMALL KLINGON COLONY
NEAR THE BORDER.

738
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,334
CAPTAIN PICARD?
( beeping )

739
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,919
YES?
YES?

740
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,921
CAPTAIN, McKINLEY STATION
IS SIGNALING.

741
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,714
THEY WANT TO KNOW
WHEN WE'LL BE DOCKING.

742
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,424
TELL McKINLEY
WE'VE BEEN CALLED AWAY

743
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,717
ON A PRIORITY MISSION.

744
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,177
AYE, SIR.

745
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,929
SO YOU'VE KEPT
THE NAME.

746
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,848
I'VE PREPARED QUARTERS FOR YOU
ON DECK FIVE.

747
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,265
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GET SOME REST.

748
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,767
NO I'M FINE, I DON'T NEED REST.

749
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,894
NELL, PLEASE ESCORT
THE AMBASSADOR

750
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,312
TO HIS QUARTERS.

751
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,107
LOOK, YOU ARE TREATING ME
AS IF I AM AN INVALID.

752
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,818
I DO HAVE A FEW YEARS
LEFT IN ME YET.

753
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,820
I DO NOT WANT
TO BE LED AROUND

754
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,905
AND I DO NOT
WANT TO BE PATRONIZED.

755
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,366
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

756
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,786
NOW, I'LL GO
AND GET SOME REST.

757
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:56,131
HOW LONG SINCE
HIS LAST NEUROLOGICAL SCAN?

758
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,465
I'M NOT SURE.

759
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,300
BUT I WOULDN'T TRY
SUGGESTING IT.

760
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,012
HE SAYS HE'S NOT TAKING
ANY MORE DAMN TESTS.

761
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:06,599
DO YOU REALLY THINK
HE'S MOVING THROUGH TIME?

762
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,400
I'M NOT SURE I DO EITHER.

763
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,112
BUT HE'S JEAN-LUC PICARD,

764
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,780
AND IF HE WANTS TO GO
ON ONE MORE MISSION

765
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,908
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

766
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,369
WE'LL FIND THE ANOMALY.

767
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,165
I KNOW WE WILL.

768
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,878
REPORT.

769
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,714
WE'RE NEARING THE COORDINATES
YOU GAVE ME, SIR.

770
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,842
IS THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL
IN THE VICINITY, MR. DATA?

771
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:44,637
HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE
"UNUSUAL," SIR?

772
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,181
EVERY REGION OF SPACE
HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE PROPERTIES

773
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,307
THAT CANNOT BE FOUND
ANYWHERE ELSE.

774
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:52,437
THERE SHOULD BE
A BARRIER OF SOME SORT NEARBY--

775
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,189
A LARGE PLASMA FIELD,

776
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,523
HIGHLY DISRUPTIVE.

777
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,942
NOTHING, SIR.

778
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,572
THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME,
THE RIGHT PLACE.

779
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,909
HE SHOULD BE HERE NOW.

780
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,620
WHO, SIR?

781
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,457
Q! WE'RE HERE.

782
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:15,210
THIS HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH.

783
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:22,050
COUNSELOR, DO YOU SENSE
AN ALIEN PRESENCE?

784
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,052
NO, SIR.

785
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,142
WHAT IS A "Q?"

786
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,477
IT'S A LETTER
OF THE ALPHABET

787
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,728
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

788
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,855
Picard:
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

789
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,192
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

790
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,568
MAINTAIN THIS POSITION.

791
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,114
I'LL BE IN MY READY ROOM.

792
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:47,284
( all yelling )

793
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,017
( crowd falls silent )

794
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,227
<i>MON CAPITAN.</i>

795
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,313
I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER GET HERE.

796
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,735
Q, I KNEW IT.

797
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,529
WHAT'S GOING ON?

798
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,156
IT'S JUDGE Q TO YOU.

799
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:29,284
AND ISN'T IT OBVIOUS
WHAT'S GOING ON?

800
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,119
( crowd laughing )

801
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,621
THE LAST TIME
THAT I STOOD HERE

802
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,373
WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO.

803
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,624
SEVEN YEARS AGO?

804
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,044
HOW LITTLE DO YOU MORTALS
UNDERSTAND TIME.

805
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,046
MUST YOU BE SO LINEAR, JEAN-LUC?

806
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:44,299
YOU ACCUSED ME
OF BEING THE REPRESENTATIVE

807
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,551
OF A... A BARBAROUS SPECIES.

808
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,636
I BELIEVE MY EXACT WORDS WERE,

809
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,723
"A DANGEROUS,
SAVAGE, CHILD-RACE."

810
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,017
( laughter )

811
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,395
WE DEMONSTRATED TO YOU

812
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,481
THAT MANKIND HAD BECOME
PEACEFUL AND BENEVOLENT.

813
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,692
YOU AGREED
AND YOU LET US GO ON OUR WAY.

814
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,944
NOW WHY AM I STANDING HERE
AGAIN?

815
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,113
OH, YOU'D LIKE ME
TO CONNECT THE DOTS FOR YOU--

816
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,032
LEAD YOU FROM "A" TO "B" TO "C"

817
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:13,203
SO THAT YOUR PUNY MIND
COULD COMPREHEND.

818
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,954
HOW BORING.

819
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,166
( laughter )

820
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,878
THEY'D BE
SO MUCH MORE ENTERTAINED

821
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,047
IF YOU JUST TRIED
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

822
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,132
I'LL ANSWER

823
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:31,930
ANY TEN QUESTIONS THAT CALL
FOR A "YES" OR A "NO."

824
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,973
( cheering )

825
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,975
WELL?

826
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:39,229
ARE YOU PUTTING MANKIND
ON TRIAL AGAIN?

827
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,980
NO.

828
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,481
YEAH, YEAH!

829
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,112
IS THERE ANY CONNECTION

830
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,780
BETWEEN THE TRIAL
SEVEN YEARS AGO

831
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,074
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?

832
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,575
I'D HAVE TO SAY YES.

833
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,993
YEAH, YEAH!

834
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:59,916
THE SPATIAL ANOMALY
IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE--

835
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,628
IS IT RELATED
TO WHAT'S GOING ON?

836
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,755
MOST DEFINITELY YES.

837
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,049
IS IT PART
OF A ROMULAN PLOT--

838
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,801
A PLOY TO START A WAR?

839
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,011
NO AND NO.

840
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,059
FIVE DOWN!
THAT'S ONLY FOUR.

841
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,769
IS IT A ROMULAN PLOT?

842
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,105
IS IT A PLOY TO START A WAR?

843
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:25,233
THOSE ARE
SEPARATE QUESTIONS.

844
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,820
DID YOU CREATE THE ANOMALY?

845
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,905
NO, NO, NO.

846
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,199
( laughing ):
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO SURPRISED

847
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,243
WHEN YOU REALIZE
WHERE IT CAME FROM...

848
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,078
IF YOU EVER FIGURE IT OUT.

849
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:40,332
ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY SHIFTING THROUGH TIME?

850
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,876
I'LL ANSWER THAT QUESTION

851
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,545
IF YOU PROMISE
YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE.

852
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,758
YES.
WHY?

853
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,719
SORRY! THAT'S NOT A "YES"
OR A "NO" QUESTION.

854
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,263
YOU FORFEIT THE REST
OF YOUR QUESTIONS.

855
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,265
( booing )

856
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,891
CHEATER!

857
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,811
I EXPECTED AS MUCH.

858
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,438
YOU'RE SUCH
A LIMITED CREATURE--

859
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:07,359
A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF WHY WE MADE OUR DECISION.

860
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,861
THE TRIAL NEVER ENDED, CAPTAIN.

861
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,030
WE NEVER REACHED A VERDICT.

862
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,906
BUT NOW WE HAVE.

863
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,908
YOU'RE GUILTY.

864
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,160
GUILTY OF WHAT?

865
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,537
OF BEING INFERIOR.

866
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,122
SEVEN YEARS AGO,
I SAID WE'D BE WATCHING YOU,

867
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,415
AND WE HAVE BEEN,

868
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,000
HOPING THAT
YOUR APE-LIKE RACE

869
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,668
WOULD DEMONSTRATE SOME GROWTH,

870
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,586
GIVE SOME INDICATION

871
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,507
THAT YOUR MINDS
HAD ROOM FOR EXPANSION.

872
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,675
BUT WHAT HAVE WE SEEN INSTEAD?

873
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,887
YOU WORRYING ABOUT
COMMANDER RIKER'S CAREER,

874
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:39,682
LISTENING TO COUNSELOR TROI'S
PEDANTIC PSYCHO-BABBLE,

875
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,435
INDULGING DATA

876
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:45,397
IN HIS WITLESS
EXPLORATION OF HUMANITY.

877
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,399
WE'VE JOURNEYED TO COUNTLESS
NEW WORLDS.

878
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,108
WE'VE CONTACTED NEW SPECIES.

879
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,360
WE HAVE EXPANDED

880
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,611
OUR UNDERSTANDING
OF THE UNIVERSE.

881
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,531
IN YOUR OWN PALTRY, LIMITED WAY.

882
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:57,450
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW FAR YOU HAVE TO GO.

883
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,286
BUT INSTEAD OF USING
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS

884
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:04,249
TO CHANGE AND TO GROW,
YOU HAVE SQUANDERED THEM.

885
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:08,002
WE ARE WHAT WE ARE,
AND WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN.

886
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,838
IT IS NOT FOR YOU
TO SET THE STANDARDS

887
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,715
BY WHICH
WE SHOULD BE JUDGED.

888
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,426
OH, BUT IT IS, AND WE HAVE.

889
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:17,970
TIME MAY BE ETERNAL, CAPTAIN,
BUT OUR PATIENCE IS NOT.

890
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,433
IT'S TIME TO PUT AN END
TO YOUR TREK THROUGH THE STARS,

891
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:24,810
MAKE ROOM FOR OTHER
MORE WORTHY SPECIES.

892
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,814
YOU'RE GOING TO DENY US
TRAVEL THROUGH SPACE?

893
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,066
NO...

894
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,068
( laughter )

895
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:34,112
YOU OBTUSE PIECE OF FLOTSAM.

896
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,364
YOU'RE TO BE DENIED EXISTENCE.

897
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,657
HUMANITY'S FATE HAS BEEN SEALED.

898
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,243
YOU WILL BE DESTROYED.

899
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:42,287
Q, I DO NOT BELIEVE

900
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,163
THAT EVEN YOU
ARE CAPABLE OF SUCH AN ACT.

901
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,707
AYE. THERE YOU GO AGAIN,

902
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,209
ALWAYS BLAMING ME
FOR EVERYTHING.

903
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,002
WELL, THIS TIME,
I'M NOT YOUR ENEMY.

904
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,005
I'M NOT THE ONE THAT CAUSES
THE ANNIHILATION OF MANKIND.

905
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,132
YOU ARE.

906
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,675
ME?
THAT'S RIGHT.

907
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,511
YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW.

908
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,931
YOU DID IT BEFORE,
AND YOU'LL DO IT YET AGAIN.

909
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,517
WHAT SORT OF MEANINGLESS
DOUBLE-TALK IS THIS?

910
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,603
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

911
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:08,062
( laughter )

912
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,274
I HAVE ONLY MYSELF
TO BLAME, I SUPPOSE.

913
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,775
I BELIEVED IN YOU.

914
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,402
I THOUGHT YOU HAD POTENTIAL

915
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,779
BUT, APPARENTLY,
I WAS WRONG.

916
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:20,575
MAY WHATEVER GOD
YOU BELIEVE IN...

917
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,495
HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL.

918
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:25,746
THIS COURT STANDS ADJOURNED.

919
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,374
( gong sounds )

920
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,469
COMMANDER, ASSEMBLE
THE SENIOR STAFF

921
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,387
AND GO TO RED ALERT.

922
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,805
WE HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM
THAN I THOUGHT.

923
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,682
RED ALERT!

924
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,476
( alarm blares )

925
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,902
I DON'T BELIEVE HIM. THIS HAS TO
BE ANOTHER ONE OF Q's GAMES.

926
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,155
HE'S PROBABLY LISTENING
TO US RIGHT NOW

927
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,532
GETTING A BIG LAUGH

928
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,741
OUT OF WATCHING US
JUMP THROUGH HIS HOOPS.

929
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,243
NORMALLY, I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU

930
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,539
BUT THIS TIME I FEEL
THAT SOMEHOW IT IS DIFFERENT.

931
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:10,333
THERE WAS A DEADLY EARNESTNESS
ABOUT HIM.

932
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,750
I THINK HE'S SERIOUS...

933
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,878
WHICH MEANS
THAT IN SOME FASHION,

934
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:17,714
I AM GOING TO BE THE CAUSE
OF THE DESTRUCTION OF HUMANITY.

935
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:20,218
BUT DIDN'T Q SAY
YOU ALREADY HAD CAUSED IT?

936
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:23,304
AND THAT YOU
WERE CAUSING IT NOW?

937
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,057
GIVEN THAT THERE IS
AN APPARENT DISCONTINUITY

938
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:29,227
BETWEEN THE THREE TIME PERIODS
THE CAPTAIN HAS VISITED,

939
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,604
Q's STATEMENT
MAY BE ACCURATE, IF CONFUSING.

940
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,398
SO, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

941
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:34,857
LOCK MYSELF IN A ROOM

942
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,651
IN ALL THE THREE
DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS?

943
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,611
CAPTAIN. MAYBE NOT ACTING

944
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,154
IS WHAT CAUSES
THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND.

945
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,614
WHAT IF YOU WERE NEEDED
ON THE BRIDGE

946
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,324
AT A KEY MOMENT
AND YOU WEREN'T THERE?

947
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,034
I DON'T THINK WE CAN START
SECOND-GUESSING OURSELVES.

948
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,827
I THINK WE HAVE
TO PROCEED NORMALLY

949
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,664
AND DEAL WITH EACH SITUATION
AS IT OCCURS.

950
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:53,292
AGREED. I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT MY CONVERSATION WITH Q.

951
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,836
HE ADMITTED
THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE

952
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,130
FOR MY SHIFTING THROUGH TIME.

953
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,509
NOW IT OCCURRED TO ME...

954
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:05,179
THAT HE MIGHT BE GIVING ME A
CHANCE SOMEHOW TO SAVE HUMANITY.

955
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,763
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

956
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:09,058
WELL, HE'S ALWAYS HAD
A FASCINATION WITH HUMANITY

957
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,518
WITH MYSELF,
IN PARTICULAR.

958
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,144
I THINK HE HAS MORE THAN
A PASSING INTEREST

959
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,354
IN WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.

960
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,980
Data:
THAT IS TRUE.

961
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,233
Q's INTEREST IN YOU HAS ALWAYS
BEEN VERY SIMILAR

962
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,610
TO THAT OF A MASTER

963
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,320
AND HIS BELOVED PET.

964
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,948
THAT WAS ONLY
AN ANALOGY, CAPTAIN.

965
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,991
<i>Captain Picard.</i>
GO AHEAD.

966
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,286
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>the Neutral Zone, Captain.</i>

967
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,828
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

968
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:33,999
ALL STOP.

969
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,461
INITIATE LONG-RANGE SCANS.

970
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,511
CAPTAIN, THERE ARE FOUR WARBIRDS
HOLDING POSITION

971
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,430
ON THE ROMULAN SIDE
OF THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

972
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,515
THE FEDERATION STARSHIPS
<i>CONCORD</i> AND<i> BOZEMAN</i>

973
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,934
ARE HOLDING POSITION
ON OUR SIDE.

974
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,394
A FACE-OFF.

975
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:56,105
THE QUESTION IS,
WHO'S GOING TO BE FIRST?

976
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:58,065
WE ARE.

977
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,694
MR. WORF,
HAIL THE ROMULAN FLAGSHIP.

978
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:05,072
Worf:
THE WARBIRD<i> TERIX</i> IS RESPONDING.

979
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,950
<i>Captain Picard.</i>

980
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,702
HELLO, WORF.

981
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,412
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

982
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:13,205
<i>It is good to see you again.</i>

983
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:17,126
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE
TO READ OUR REQUEST?

984
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,628
<i>Yes, but you must realize</i>

985
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:21,506
<i>I am no longer a member</i>
<i>of the High Council.</i>

986
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,341
BUT SURELY WORF YOU MUST STILL
HAVE SOME INFLUENCE.

987
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:26,344
WE HAVE TO GET
INTO THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

988
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,472
CAN'T YOU JUST GET US PERMISSION
TO CROSS THE BORDER?

989
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,098
<i>I must refuse.</i>

990
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,517
<i>It is for your own safety.</i>

991
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,645
<i>The Neutral Zone</i>
<i>is extremely volatile.</i>

992
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:39,190
<i>If Admiral Riker had given you</i>
<i>a starship with a cloak</i>

993
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,067
<i>you would have been safe.</i>

994
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,653
<i>It is hard to believe</i>

995
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:46,030
<i>that even he would refuse</i>
<i>to help you.</i>

996
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,116
I DON'T CARE
WHAT KIND OF SHIP WE GO IN!

997
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,868
WE HAVE TO GET
TO THE DEVRON SYSTEM.

998
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,371
<i>I am sorry.</i>

999
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,040
<i>My first duty is to the Empire.</i>

1000
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,167
<i>I must adhere to regulations.</i>

1001
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,670
WELL, I KNOW
THAT I'M AN OLD MAN

1002
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,171
AND I'M OUT OF TOUCH

1003
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,923
BUT THE WORF
THAT I REMEMBER

1004
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,592
WAS MORE CONCERNED
WITH THINGS

1005
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,427
LIKE HONOR AND LOYALTY

1006
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,222
THAN RULES
AND REGULATIONS.

1007
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:14,392
BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

1008
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:18,479
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT THE WORF
I ONCE KNEW.

1009
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,106
<i>Dor-sHo GHA!</i>

1010
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,817
<i>You have always used</i>
<i>your knowledge</i>

1011
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,819
<i>of Klingon honor and tradition</i>

1012
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,154
<i>to get what you want from me.</i>

1013
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,532
BECAUSE IT ALWAYS WORKS, WORF!

1014
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:33,160
YOUR PROBLEM IS THAT YOU
REALLY DO HAVE A SENSE OF HONOR

1015
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,330
AND YOU REALLY DO CARE
ABOUT TRUST AND LOYALTY.

1016
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,500
DON'T BLAME ME
FOR KNOWING YOU SO WELL.

1017
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,043
<i>Very well.</i>

1018
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:44,004
<i>You may cross the border.</i>

1019
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,882
<i>But...</i>

1020
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:48,342
<i>only if I come with you.</i>

1021
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,677
<i>I am familiar</i>

1022
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,970
<i>with the Neutral Zone.</i>

1023
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,726
TERMS ACCEPTED.

1024
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,981
INFORM TRANSPORTER ROOM TWO
TO BEAM THE GOVERNOR ABOARD.

1025
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,942
I MUST MAKE ONE THING
VERY CLEAR, JEAN-LUC.

1026
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,862
IF WE RUN
INTO SERIOUS OPPOSITION

1027
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:10,322
I'M TAKING US BACK
INTO FEDERATION TERRITORY.

1028
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,742
WE AREN'T WELL-ARMED
AND WOULDN'T LAST LONG

1029
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:14,201
IN A FIGHT.

1030
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,537
GOVERNOR WORF
IS ABOARD, CAPTAIN.

1031
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,789
ALL RIGHT.

1032
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:20,249
SET COURSE
FOR THE DEVRON SYSTEM.

1033
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,709
WARP 13.

1034
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:28,257
ONCE MORE,
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE?

1035
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,477
ENGAGE.

1036
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,479
ENGAGE TO WHERE, SIR?

1037
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,690
UH, SET A COURSE
FOR THE DEVRON SYSTEM

1038
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,609
AND ENGAGE AT WARP NINE.

1039
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,445
THE DEVRON SYSTEM IS INSIDE
THE NEUTRAL ZONE, SIR.

1040
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,405
I'M AWARE OF THAT, LIEUTENANT.
CARRY OUT MY ORDERS, CHIEF.

1041
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,324
AYE, SIR.
CAPTAIN,

1042
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,991
MAY I HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU IN PRIVATE?

1043
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:57,453
YES OF COURSE, COUNSELOR.

1044
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,704
CONTACT FARPOINT STATION.

1045
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,498
I WISH TO SPEAK
WITH COMMANDER RIKER.

1046
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,875
AYE, SIR.

1047
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:10,466
CAPTAIN, I JUST WANTED
TO VOICE MY CONCERNS

1048
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,218
ABOUT THE WAY
THE CREW IS RESPONDING

1049
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,179
TO YOUR UNEXPECTED ORDERS.

1050
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,639
THEY DON'T TRUST ME.

1051
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,599
THEY THINK
THAT I'M BEHAVING ERRATICALLY.

1052
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,226
SOME DO. OTHERS ARE CONFUSED.

1053
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,103
IT TAKES SOME TIME
FOR A NEW CREW

1054
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,147
TO GET TO KNOW THEIR CAPTAIN
AND FOR HIM TO KNOW THEM.

1055
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,565
I UNDERSTAND,

1056
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,693
BUT I ALSO KNOW
WHAT THIS CREW IS CAPABLE OF

1057
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,235
EVEN IF THEY DON'T.

1058
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:33,572
IT WOULD ALSO HELP
IF THEY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1059
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,283
I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT
OPERATING IN THE DARK

1060
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,244
BUT RIGHT NOW, I DON'T THINK
I HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE.

1061
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,330
Tasha:
<i>Yar to Captain Picard.</i>

1062
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,916
<i>I have Commander Riker</i>
<i>for you, sir.</i>

1063
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,710
EXCUSE ME.

1064
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,963
PUT HIM THROUGH HERE.

1065
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,340
COMMANDER RIKER,
I WANTED TO INFORM YOU

1066
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,134
THAT WE WILL BE DELAYED PICKING
YOU UP AT FARPOINT STATION.

1067
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,178
<i>I see. May I ask how long?</i>

1068
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,764
I CAN'T SAY.
I'LL KEEP YOU UPDATED.

1069
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,766
WILL YOU INFORM DR. CRUSHER
AND LIEUTENANT La FORGE

1070
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,976
OF OUR DELAY?

1071
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,770
<i>Understood. Riker out.</i>

1072
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,441
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE,
COUNSELOR?

1073
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,110
ACTUALLY, SIR, THERE IS.

1074
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,238
I WAS DEBATING
WHETHER TO MENTION IT

1075
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,114
AND PERHAPS...

1076
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,036
IT'S ABOUT COMMANDER RIKER.

1077
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:22,078
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

1078
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:25,624
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT HE AND I HAVE HAD A...

1079
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,044
PRIOR RELATIONSHIP.

1080
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,712
I SEE.

1081
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,339
DO YOU THINK THIS WILL
INTERFERE WITH YOUR DUTIES?

1082
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,674
NOT AT ALL.

1083
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,009
IT HAPPENED SEVERAL YEARS AGO,

1084
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,011
AND IT'S WELL BEHIND
BOTH OF US NOW.

1085
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,512
I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

1086
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,389
I APPRECIATE
YOUR TELLING ME.

1087
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,474
WELL, I'M QUITE SURE THAT THE
TWO OF YOU WILL FIND SOME WAY

1088
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,142
TO DEAL
WITH THE SITUATION.

1089
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,395
THANK YOU, SIR.

1090
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,155
TEA, EARL GREY, HOT.

1091
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:00,367
Beverage Maker:
<i>That beverage</i>
<i>has not been programmed</i>

1092
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,286
<i>into the replication system.</i>

1093
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,496
<i>So, Captain,</i>

1094
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,625
<i>how long shall</i>
<i>we stare at each other</i>

1095
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,585
<i>across the Neutral Zone?</i>

1096
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:13,297
THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE,
TOMOLAK.

1097
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,466
WE EACH KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE.

1098
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:19,053
WE COULD EACH SEND ONE SHIP
INTO THE NEUTRAL ZONE

1099
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,846
TO INVESTIGATE THE ANOMALY

1100
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,431
IN THE DEVRON SYSTEM.

1101
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,809
<i>Has Starfleet Command</i>
<i>approved this arrangement?</i>

1102
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,519
NO.<i> </i>
<i>I like it already.</i>

1103
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,021
<i>Agreed.</i>

1104
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,564
<i>One ship from each side.</i>

1105
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,567
<i>But I warn you,</i>
<i>if another Federation starship</i>

1106
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,151
<i>tries to enter the zone...</i>

1107
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:36,487
THERE IS NO NEED TO MAKE
THREATS.

1108
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,196
WE EACH KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES.

1109
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,907
<i>Very well.</i>

1110
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,701
<i>I'll see you</i>
<i>in the Devron system.</i>

1111
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,246
HELM, SET A COURSE
FOR THE DEVRON SYSTEM.

1112
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,873
WARP FIVE.
Helm: AYE, SIR.

1113
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,041
ENGAGE.

1114
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:52,210
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

1115
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,259
SENSORS ARE PICKING UP
A LARGE SUBSPACE ANOMALY

1116
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,012
DIRECTLY AHEAD.

1117
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:02,513
ALL STOP.

1118
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,056
ON SCREEN.

1119
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,601
FULL SCAN, MR. DATA.

1120
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,311
Data:
AYE, SIR.

1121
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,022
Picard:
WE HAVE TO GET AS MUCH
INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE

1122
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:12,898
ABOUT THAT ANOMALY.

1123
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,400
WE ARE APPROACHING
THE DEVRON SYSTEM, CAPTAIN.

1124
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,862
SENSORS ARE PICKING UP
A LARGE SUBSPACE ANOMALY

1125
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,155
DIRECTLY AHEAD.

1126
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:20,990
ALL STOP. ON SCREEN.

1127
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,122
AND IT IS LARGER IN THE PAST.

1128
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,414
SIR?

1129
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,791
NOTHING.

1130
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,710
FULL SCAN, MR. DATA.

1131
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,503
Data:
AYE, SIR.

1132
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:36,922
ON SCREEN! ON SCREEN!

1133
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,256
LET'S SEE IT!

1134
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:53,772
AS YOU CAN SEE, SIR,
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

1135
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,570
STILL NOTHING, CAPTAIN.

1136
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,197
I'VE CONDUCTED A FULL SENSOR
SWEEP

1137
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:03,908
OUT TO ONE LIGHT-YEAR
FROM THE<i> PASTEUR.</i>

1138
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,994
NO TEMPORAL ANOMALIES, NO
PARTICLE FLUCTUATIONS, NOTHING.

1139
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:10,288
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT WAS HERE
IN THE OTHER TWO TIME PERIODS.

1140
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,874
WHY ISN'T IT HERE NOW?

1141
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,959
Worf:
CAPTAIN, I HAVE BEEN MONITORING

1142
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,170
KLINGON COMMUNICATIONS CHANNELS.

1143
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,672
SEVERAL WARSHIPS
HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED

1144
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:19,840
TO THIS SECTOR TO SEARCH FOR

1145
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,134
A RENEGADE
FEDERATION VESSEL.

1146
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,764
YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF LEAVING?

1147
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,724
THERE'S NOTHING HERE, JEAN-LUC.

1148
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,226
BUT THERE SHOULD BE.
THERE HAS TO BE!

1149
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:32,019
DATA, IS THERE
SOME OTHER WAY

1150
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:35,231
TO SCAN FOR
TEMPORAL DISTURBANCES?

1151
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:38,192
SOMETHING THAT ISN'T COVERED
IN A NORMAL SENSOR SWEEP?

1152
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:41,237
THERE ARE SEVERAL METHODS OF
DETECTING TEMPORAL DISTURBANCES

1153
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:44,240
BUT WE'RE LIMITED
BY THE EQUIPMENT ON THE<i> PASTEUR.</i>

1154
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,867
WE SHOULD HEAD BACK
TO FEDERATION TERRITORY.

1155
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:50,412
HOWEVER, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE
TO MODIFY THE MAIN DEFLECTOR

1156
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,249
TO EMIT
AN INVERSE TACHYON PULSE

1157
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:55,834
WHICH COULD SCAN
BEYOND THE SUBSPACE BARRIER.

1158
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,419
THAT'S IT.
MAKE IT SO.

1159
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,963
WAIT A MINUTE.

1160
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:01,381
DATA, HOW LONG
WOULD THIS TAKE?

1161
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,926
TO MAKE THE MODIFICATIONS AND
SEARCH THE ENTIRE DEVRON SYSTEM

1162
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:06,386
WOULD TAKE
APPROXIMATELY 14 HOURS.

1163
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,723
ALRIGHT DATA, BEGIN TO MODIFY
THE TACHYON PULSE.

1164
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,516
ENSIGN CHILTON,
LAY IN A COURSE

1165
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,851
BACK TO THE FEDERATION.

1166
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,270
WE'LL STAY HERE
FOR SIX MORE HOURS.

1167
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,520
AND IF WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING

1168
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,022
WE'RE HEADING BACK,
MAXIMUM WARP.

1169
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,232
AYE, SIR.

1170
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:20,151
BUT SIX MORE HOURS
MAY NOT BE ENOUGH.

1171
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:21,944
WE HAVE TO STAY
UNTIL WE FIND IT

1172
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:24,155
NO MATTER
HOW LONG IT TAKES.

1173
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:26,322
CARRY OUT MY ORDERS.

1174
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,117
MAY I SEE YOU A MOMENT?

1175
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,542
BEVERLY,
I CANNOT BELIEVE

1176
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,877
THAT YOU ARE NOT WILLING
TO STAY HERE UNTIL--

1177
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,462
DON'T YOU EVER
QUESTION MY ORDERS

1178
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,298
ON THE BRIDGE OF MY SHIP AGAIN.

1179
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:45,259
DAMN IT!
I WAS JUST TRYING TO...

1180
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,468
LOOK,

1181
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,803
THERE ARE
LARGER CONCERNS HERE.

1182
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,054
WHAT YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND IS--

1183
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,430
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU WOULD NEVER

1184
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,016
HAVE TOLERATED
THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR

1185
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,851
BACK ON THE<i> ENTERPRISE,</i>
AND I WON'T HERE.

1186
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,227
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU'RE MY EX-CAPTAIN

1187
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:56,770
OR MY EX-HUSBAND.

1188
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,816
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1189
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,067
I WAS OUT OF LINE.

1190
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,568
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

1191
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,487
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND IS

1192
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,031
WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE.

1193
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:09,449
Q HAS SAID THAT ALL OF HUMANITY
WILL BE DESTROYED.

1194
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,118
I KNOW.

1195
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:14,288
THAT'S WHY I'VE ALLOWED US
TO STAY HERE LONGER

1196
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,498
AND KEEP LOOKING.

1197
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,877
BUT I ALSO WANT YOU
TO ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY

1198
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,420
THAT NONE OF WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS REAL.

1199
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,630
WHAT?

1200
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,801
JEAN-LUC,
I CARE FOR YOU TOO MUCH

1201
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,721
NOT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

1202
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,515
YOU HAVE
ADVANCED IRUMODIC SYNDROME.

1203
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:37,978
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ALL
OF THIS IS IN YOUR MIND.

1204
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:48,197
I'LL STAY HERE
SIX HOURS LONGER,

1205
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:50,824
AND THEN WE'RE HEADING HOME.

1206
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:55,662
I WANT YOU
TO REMEMBER,

1207
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:59,666
IF IT WERE
ANYONE ELSE BUT YOU,

1208
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,418
WE WOULDN'T
EVEN BE HERE.

1209
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,889
EH? WHAT WAS THAT
SHE SAID, SONNY?

1210
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,807
I COULDN'T QUITE HEAR HER.

1211
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:19,770
Q, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

1212
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,273
WHERE IS THE ANOMALY?

1213
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:23,648
WHERE'S YOUR MOMMY?

1214
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:24,942
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

1215
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,277
ANSWER ME!

1216
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,198
THERE IS AN ANSWER, JEAN-LUC,

1217
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,867
BUT I CAN'T
HAND IT TO YOU.

1218
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,120
ALTHOUGH YOU
DO HAVE HELP.

1219
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,746
WHAT HELP?

1220
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:40,207
YOU'RE NOT ALONE,
YOU KNOW.

1221
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,042
WHAT YOU WERE

1222
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:45,003
AND WHAT YOU
ARE TO BECOME

1223
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,798
WILL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

1224
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,466
MY TIME SHIFTING...

1225
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,636
THE ANSWER DOES LIE THERE,
DOESN'T IT?

1226
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,679
NOW, TELL ME ONE THING.

1227
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:57,391
THIS ANOMALY
WE'RE LOOKING FOR

1228
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,768
WILL THAT DESTROY HUMANITY?

1229
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:03,063
YOU'RE FORGETTING,
JEAN-LUC.

1230
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,816
YOU DESTROY
HUMANITY.

1231
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,861
BY DOING WHAT?

1232
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,155
WHEN?

1233
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:12,614
HOW CAN--?

1234
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:15,326
( beeping )
REPORT, MR. DATA.

1235
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:16,910
THE ANOMALY IS

1236
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,079
200 MILLION KILOMETERS
IN DIAMETER.

1237
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,207
IT IS A HIGHLY FOCUSED
TEMPORAL ENERGY SOURCE

1238
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,793
WHICH IS EMITTING APPROXIMATELY
THE SAME ENERGY OUTPUT

1239
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:26,753
AS TEN G-TYPE STARS.

1240
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,630
WHAT IS THE SOURCE
OF THIS ENERGY?

1241
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,090
I AM UNCERTAIN, SIR.

1242
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,468
SENSORS ARE UNABLE
TO PENETRATE THE ANOMALY.

1243
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:34,970
WHAT IF WE MODIFIED
THE MAIN DEFLECTOR

1244
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:37,139
TO EMIT AN INVERSE
TACHYON PULSE

1245
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:40,309
THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SCAN
BEYOND THE SUBSPACE BARRIER?

1246
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:44,438
THAT MIGHT GIVE US SOME IDEA OF
WHAT THE INTERIOR OF THIS THING

1247
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:45,689
LOOKS LIKE.

1248
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,983
THAT IS A MOST INTRIGUING IDEA,
SIR.

1249
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:52,570
I DO NOT BELIEVE A TACHYON BEAM
WAS EVER USED IN SUCH A WAY.

1250
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,157
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SO VERSED

1251
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,451
IN THE INTRICACIES
OF TEMPORAL THEORIES.

1252
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,496
I HAVE SOME FRIENDS
WHO ARE WELL VERSED IN IT.

1253
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:02,080
MAKE IT SO.

1254
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,334
I BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE
THE NECESSARY MODIFICATIONS

1255
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:07,585
IN MAIN
ENGINEERING, SIR.

1256
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,631
WE CAN GET MORE POWER
IF WE REROUTE

1257
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,633
THE PRIMARY E.P.S. TAPS
TO THE DEFLECTOR ARRAY.

1258
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,968
AGREED.

1259
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:24,811
INITIATING TACHYON PULSE.

1260
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,860
OKAY.

1261
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,487
THE PULSE IS HOLDING STEADY.

1262
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,364
WE'RE STARTING TO RECEIVE DATA
FROM THE SCAN.

1263
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:37,491
IT WILL TAKE THE COMPUTER
SOME TIME TO GIVE US

1264
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:40,536
A COMPLETE PICTURE
OF THE ANOMALY'S INTERIOR.

1265
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:42,371
( groaning )

1266
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:44,373
GEORDI,
WHAT IS WRONG?

1267
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:46,208
I DON'T KNOW.

1268
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:52,506
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY'S STICKING
AN ICE PICK IN MY TEMPLES.

1269
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,550
MY VISOR'S PICKING UP

1270
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:57,386
ALL KINDS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC
FLUCTUATIONS.

1271
00:59:57,386 --> 00:59:58,636
DATA TO SICK BAY.

1272
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:00,638
MEDICAL EMERGENCY
IN MAIN ENGINEERING.

1273
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,103
Beverly:
THIS IS AMAZING.

1274
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,772
THE DNA IN HIS OPTIC NERVES
IS REGENERATING.

1275
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,899
GEORDI, IT'S AS IF
YOU'RE GROWING

1276
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:12,650
NEW EYES.

1277
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,069
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

1278
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,529
IT SHOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE AT ALL.

1279
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,531
THERE'S NO
MEDICAL EXPLANATION

1280
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:20,325
FOR SPONTANEOUS REGENERATION
OF AN ORGAN.

1281
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,203
DOCTOR, WE'VE JUST GOTTEN
REPORTS FROM TWO CREW MEMBERS

1282
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,788
WHO SAY THEY HAVE OLD SCARS

1283
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,873
WHICH ARE HEALING
THEMSELVES.

1284
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,627
CAPTAIN, I BELIEVE
I HAVE A PARTIAL EXPLANATION.

1285
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,129
I'VE COMPLETED MY ANALYSIS

1286
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,298
OF THE ANOMALY.

1287
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:36,007
IT APPEARS TO BE A MULTI-PHASIC
TEMPORAL CONVERGENCE

1288
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,675
IN THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM.

1289
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,470
IN ENGLISH, DATA.

1290
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:43,974
IT IS, IN ESSENCE,
AN ERUPTION OF ANTI-TIME.

1291
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,392
ANTI-TIME?

1292
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,603
A RELATIVELY NEW CONCEPT
IN TEMPORAL MECHANICS.

1293
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:50,522
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
ANTI-TIME AND NORMAL TIME

1294
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:51,898
IS ANALOGOUS
TO THE RELATIONSHIP

1295
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,817
BETWEEN ANTI-MATTER
AND NORMAL MATTER.

1296
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:59,490
SO IF TIME AND ANTI-TIME
WERE TO COLLIDE...?

1297
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,617
THEY WOULD ANNIHILATE
ONE ANOTHER,

1298
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:03,201
CAUSING A RUPTURE
IN SPACE.

1299
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,162
I BELIEVE THIS IS
WHAT HAPPENED

1300
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:06,455
IN THE DEVRON SYSTEM.

1301
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:08,373
THE RUPTURE
MAY BE SENDING OUT

1302
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,791
WAVES OF TEMPORAL ENERGY

1303
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,169
WHICH ARE DISRUPTING
THE NORMAL FLOW OF TIME.

1304
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,670
DATA, WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED

1305
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,047
THIS COLLISION
OF TIME AND ANTI-TIME?

1306
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,300
ANTI-TIME, SIR?

1307
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,261
I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU MODIFY
THE DEFLECTORS TO SEND OUT

1308
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:23,597
AN INVERSE TACHYON PULSE,
THEN YOU'LL FIND

1309
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:28,477
THAT THE ANOMALY IS A RUPTURE
BETWEEN TIME AND ANTI-TIME.

1310
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:30,228
THAT IS
A FASCINATING HYPOTHESIS.

1311
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,729
HOW DID YOU--?

1312
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,231
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DISCUSS IT NOW, MR. DATA.

1313
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,484
DO THE MODIFICATIONS
AND SEND OUT THE PULSE.

1314
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:38,903
THEN TRY WORKING ON A THEORY
AS TO WHAT CAUSED THIS RUPTURE.

1315
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:43,116
MR. O'BRIEN,
HOW LARGE IS THIS ANOMALY?

1316
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,620
APPROXIMATELY 400 MILLION
KILOMETERS IN DIAMETER, SIR.

1317
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,787
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

1318
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:51,542
WHY IT'S BIGGER
IN THE PAST.

1319
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:53,084
LIEUTENANT, YOU HAVE THE BRIDGE.

1320
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,628
I'LL BE IN MY READY ROOM.

1321
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,672
AYE, SIR.

1322
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,258
Picard:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1323
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,177
Beverly:
WE'RE UNDER ATTACK.

1324
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,803
SHIELDS STRAIGHT DOWN
TO 52 PERCENT.

1325
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,682
MINOR DAMAGE
TO THE PORT NACELLE.

1326
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:08,433
TWO KLINGON
ATTACK CRUISERS

1327
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,727
DECLOAKING
TO PORT AND STARBOARD.

1328
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,823
WARP SPEED.
GET US OUT OF HERE.

1329
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,201
WARP POWER'S OFF-LINE, SIR.

1330
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,456
HEADING 1-4-8, MARK 2-1-5. FULL
IMPULSE.

1331
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,712
IMPULSE POWERS
FLUCTUATING.

1332
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:38,129
SHIELDS DOWN TO 30 PERCENT.

1333
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,548
WEAPONS STATUS.

1334
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:42,300
THESE WEAPONS ARE NO MATCH
FOR THEIR SHIELDS.

1335
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,512
GEORDI, WE NEED MORE WARP
POWER-- NOW.

1336
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,472
I'M TRYING, CAPTAIN.
THEY'RE TOO MUCH FOR US.

1337
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:50,141
I CAN'T KEEP
THE PHASE INDUCERS ONLINE.

1338
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,813
SHIELDS DOWN TO 9 PERCENT.

1339
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,691
ONE MORE HIT,
AND THEY'LL COLLAPSE.

1340
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,109
OPEN A CHANNEL.

1341
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,736
OPEN.

1342
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:03,071
THIS IS CAPTAIN BEVERLY PICARD.

1343
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:06,157
WE ARE A MEDICAL SHIP
ON A MISSION OF MERCY.

1344
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,285
PLEASE BREAK OFF ALL...

1345
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,706
WORF, SIGNAL OUR SURRENDER.

1346
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:22,132
tOS vAH'CHA DO WORF.

1347
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:23,341
DO'LO JEGH!

1348
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,802
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

1349
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,512
( explosion )

1350
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,939
OUR SHIELDS HAVE COLLAPSED.

1351
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,357
WE ARE DEFENSELESS.

1352
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:42,277
CAPTAIN, ANOTHER SHIP
IS DECLOAKING,

1353
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,821
BEARING 2-1-5,
MARK 3-1-0.

1354
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,865
IT'S THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

1355
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,081
THEY'RE HAILING US.

1356
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,083
Beverly:
ON SCREEN.

1357
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:00,754
<i>I had a feeling you weren't</i>
<i>going listen to me. Stand by.</i>

1358
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,214
<i>I'll see if I can get</i>
<i>the Klingons' attention.</i>

1359
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,175
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

1360
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:17,479
THE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> IS DRAWING
THEIR FIRE.

1361
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:19,272
DAMAGE REPORT.

1362
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,441
THE WARP CORE
HAS BEEN BADLY DAMAGED.

1363
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:23,485
THERE'S A BREACH
IN PROGRESS.

1364
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:24,861
WE HAVE TO STOP IT.

1365
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,280
Data:
THE KLINGON SHIP
IS DISENGAGING.

1366
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,115
ADMIRAL RIKER
IS HAILING US.

1367
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,742
<i>Our sensors indicate</i>

1368
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:32,536
<i>your ship has a warp core</i>
<i>breach in progress.</i>

1369
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:34,996
<i>Prepare for emergency beam-out.</i>

1370
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:45,549
ALL THE<i> PASTEUR'S</i> CREW
IS SAFELY ONBOARD, ADMIRAL.

1371
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,718
RAISE THE SHIELDS.
WHERE ARE THE KLINGONS?

1372
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,010
THEY'RE STILL
MOVING OFF, SIR.

1373
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,303
HALF A LIGHT-YEAR AWAY.

1374
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,347
THEY'LL BE BACK.

1375
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:55,726
AS I SAID I FIGURED YOU WOULDN'T
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

1376
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,811
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
HAD MORE SENSE

1377
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,856
THAN TO SEND A DEFENSELESS SHIP
ACROSS THE BORDER

1378
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:02,982
INTO HOSTILE TERRITORY
WITH NO ESCORT.

1379
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,568
IF YOU HAD NOT
TURNED DOWN THE CAPTAIN

1380
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:05,777
WHEN HE CAME TO YOU FOR HELP,

1381
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:07,278
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED!

1382
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,698
BUT UNLIKE YOU,
I STILL HAVE A SENSE

1383
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:11,032
OF HONOR AND LOYALTY.

1384
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,534
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS!

1385
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,870
THE<i> PASTEUR'S</i> CORE
IS GOING TO BREACH!

1386
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,416
TAKE US OUT OF HERE

1387
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,793
AT FULL IMPULSE.

1388
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:23,837
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

1389
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:33,388
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

1390
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,890
NO, WILL, WE CAN'T!

1391
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,600
WE HAVE TO SAVE HUMANITY!

1392
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,809
ENGAGE CLOAK.

1393
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,728
Man:
ADMIRAL, WE TOOK A DIRECT HIT

1394
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:41,104
TO THE STARBOARD
PLASMA COIL.

1395
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:42,355
OUR CLOAK ISN'T FUNCTIONING.

1396
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,648
ENGINEERING REPORTS IT'LL BE

1397
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,817
SEVEN HOURS
BEFORE WE CAN CLOAK AGAIN.

1398
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,485
Riker:
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL DO IT
THE OLD-FASHION WAY.

1399
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,613
SET A COURSE FOR
FEDERATION SPACE, WARP 13.

1400
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:52,073
WILL, DON'T LEAVE.
WE HAVE TO STAY HERE

1401
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,576
AND FIND OUT WHAT IS CAUSING
THE TEMPORAL ANOMALY!

1402
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:55,869
WE CAN'T STAY, CAPTAIN.

1403
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:58,496
WE HAVE TO--
EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON IT.

1404
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:02,542
WE CAN'T LEAVE NOW.
PLEASE, LISTEN TO ME!

1405
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,839
( indistinct chattering )

1406
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:14,596
YOUR VISUAL ACUITY IS
IMPROVING BY THE HOUR, GEORDI.

1407
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:15,931
( computer beeps )

1408
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,523
I'M SORRY, ALISSA.
MAY I TAKE ANOTHER LOOK?

1409
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,778
YOU'LL HAVE A LITTLE TENDERNESS
FOR A FEW DAYS.

1410
01:06:29,778 --> 01:06:32,530
THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.

1411
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,329
JEAN-LUC.

1412
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,833
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
ALISSA.

1413
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,339
ALISSA LOST THE BABY.

1414
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,633
I THINK
IT'S THE SAME PHENOMENON

1415
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:53,259
THAT AFFECTED GEORDI.

1416
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,012
SOMEHOW THE TEMPORAL ENERGY
FROM THE ANOMALY

1417
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,055
CAUSED THE FETAL TISSUE
TO REVERT

1418
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:00,224
TO AN EARLIER STAGE
OF DEVELOPMENT.

1419
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:03,269
IT'S AS IF THE UNBORN CHILD
BEGAN TO GROW YOUNGER

1420
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,481
UNTIL FINALLY THE DNA ITSELF
BEGAN TO BREAK DOWN.

1421
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:07,732
HOW IS SHE?

1422
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,985
PHYSICALLY,
SHE'S FINE, FOR NOW.

1423
01:07:09,985 --> 01:07:12,570
BUT IF THIS
TEMPORAL REVERSION CONTINUES

1424
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,698
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US ARE
GOING TO BE FINE

1425
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:15,991
FOR MUCH LONGER.

1426
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:18,451
SO THIS IS AFFECTING
THE ENTIRE CREW.

1427
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,705
OUR CELLULAR STRUCTURES
APPEAR TO BE COALESCING--

1428
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,289
REVERTING TO EARLIER FORMS.

1429
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,666
IN SOME CASES

1430
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,377
THIS HAS CAUSED
OLD INJURIES TO BE HEALED

1431
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,587
BUT THE EFFECT
IS ONLY TEMPORARY.

1432
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:33,132
EVENTUALLY,
IT MAY KILL ALL OF US.

1433
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:38,346
WE HAVE TO DETERMINE
HOW WIDESPREAD THIS EFFECT IS.

1434
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:40,473
CONTACT STARBASE 23.

1435
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,641
THAT'S THE NEWEST OUTPOST.

1436
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,476
HAVE THEM CHECK
THEIR PERSONNEL

1437
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,228
TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY SIGNS
OF TEMPORAL REVERSION.

1438
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:46,897
AYE, SIR.

1439
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:49,148
MR. DATA, HOW CLOSE ARE YOU TO
COMPLETING THE TACHYON SCAN?

1440
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:51,150
APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR,
45 MINUTES, SIR.

1441
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,736
GOOD. WHEN IT'S DONE,

1442
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:55,279
I WANT YOU TO FIND SOME WAY OF
COLLAPSING THIS ANOMALY

1443
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:56,948
WITHOUT MAKING THINGS WORSE.

1444
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:58,241
GIVE ME A RISK ANALYSIS

1445
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,076
OF WHATEVER SOLUTION
YOU COME UP WITH.

1446
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,828
AYE, SIR.
DISMISSED.

1447
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:07,959
( door hisses open and closed )

1448
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:13,214
Q:
IT'S A PRETTY BIG DECISION,

1449
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,841
JEAN-LUC.

1450
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:18,219
TINKERING WITH AN ANOMALY
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

1451
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,846
TRYING TO COLLAPSE IT.

1452
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,305
ISN'T THAT RISKY?

1453
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:23,892
WHY? WILL THAT CAUSE
THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND?

1454
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,309
MAYBE.

1455
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:28,980
ON THE OTHER HAND,
MAYBE LEAVING IT ALONE

1456
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,857
WOULD BE THE WRONG
THING TO DO.

1457
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:34,235
IT'S A PRETTY BIG DECISION,
ALL RIGHT.

1458
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:37,405
WOULD IT HELP TO HAVE
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE?

1459
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:41,785
Q:
WELCOME HOME.

1460
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:43,327
HOME?

1461
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:46,163
DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE
YOUR OLD STOMPING GROUNDS?

1462
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:47,415
THIS IS EARTH--

1463
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:49,876
FRANCE, ABOUT OH
3 1/2 BILLION YEARS AGO,

1464
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:52,629
GIVE OR TAKE AN EON OR TWO.

1465
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,798
SMELLS AWFUL, DOESN'T IT?

1466
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,927
ALL THAT SULFUR
AND VOLCANIC ASH.

1467
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:01,345
I REALLY MUST SPEAK
TO THE MAID.

1468
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:04,432
Q, IS THERE ANY POINT
TO ALL THIS?

1469
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,059
LOOK.

1470
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:14,358
Picard:
SO THE ANOMALY IS HERE TOO.

1471
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,986
AT EARTH.

1472
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:17,737
Q:
AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY

1473
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:20,991
THE ANOMALY FILLS
YOUR ENTIRE QUADRANT

1474
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:22,784
OF THE GALAXY.

1475
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:26,621
THE FURTHER BACK IN TIME...

1476
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,915
THE LARGER THE ANOMALY.

1477
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,253
COME HERE.

1478
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:38,382
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

1479
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:39,968
YOU SEE THIS?

1480
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:42,261
THIS IS YOU.

1481
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,430
I'M SERIOUS.

1482
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,807
RIGHT HERE...

1483
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:48,309
LIFE IS ABOUT TO FORM
ON THIS PLANET

1484
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,811
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

1485
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:52,396
A GROUP OF AMINO ACIDS
ARE ABOUT TO COMBINE

1486
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:54,398
TO FORM
THE FIRST PROTEIN.

1487
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:56,943
THE BUILDING BLOCKS...

1488
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,402
( chuckling )

1489
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:01,823
OF WHAT YOU CALL LIFE.

1490
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,035
STRANGE, ISN'T IT?

1491
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:09,372
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW,
YOUR ENTIRE CIVILIZATION,

1492
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:14,210
IT ALL BEGINS RIGHT HERE
IN THIS LITTLE POND OF GOO.

1493
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,338
APPROPRIATE SOMEHOW,
ISN'T IT?

1494
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:18,798
TOO BAD YOU DIDN'T BRING
YOUR MICROSCOPE.

1495
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:20,133
IT'S QUITE FASCINATING.

1496
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,342
OH, LOOK.

1497
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,553
THERE THEY GO.

1498
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:26,723
THE AMINO ACIDS
ARE MOVING CLOSER.

1499
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,474
AND CLOSER.

1500
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,061
AND CLOSER.

1501
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:33,855
AW...

1502
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:36,440
NOTHING HAPPENED.

1503
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,026
SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

1504
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:43,865
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I CAUSED THE ANOMALY...

1505
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:47,202
AND THAT THE ANOMALY SOMEHOW

1506
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:51,539
DISRUPTED THE BEGINNINGS OF LIFE
ON EARTH?

1507
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,919
CONGRATULATIONS.

1508
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,379
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

1509
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,975
LET'S CONCENTRATE
ON HOW THIS ANOMALY

1510
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,309
WAS INITIALLY FORMED.

1511
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:13,853
SPECULATION.

1512
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,605
OUR TACHYON PULSE
HAS BEEN UNABLE TO COMPLETELY

1513
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,232
PENETRATE THE ANOMALY.

1514
01:11:17,232 --> 01:11:20,026
IF WE HAD INFORMATION
ON THE CENTER OF THE PHENOMENON

1515
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:22,070
WE MIGHT HAVE A BASIS
FOR SPECULATION.

1516
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,905
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN
SCAN THE INTERIOR?

1517
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,489
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING I KNOW.

1518
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,324
THERE'S JUST
TOO MUCH INTERFERENCE.

1519
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:29,244
THERE'S NOTHING ONBOARD
THAT WILL DO THE JOB.

1520
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:30,745
DO YOU KNOW WHAT COULD?

1521
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,497
IN THEORY, A TOMOGRAPHIC
IMAGING SCANNER

1522
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:35,833
CAPABLE OF MULTI-PHASIC
RESOLUTION

1523
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,586
WOULD BE ABLE TO PENETRATE
THIS MUCH INTERFERENCE.

1524
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:39,796
THE DAYSTROM INSTITUTE

1525
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,047
HAS BEEN WORKING
ON SUCH A DEVICE,

1526
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,841
BUT IT IS STILL
ONLY THEORETICAL.

1527
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,763
DATA, DO WE HAVE A TOMOGRAPHIC
IMAGING SCANNER ONBOARD?

1528
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:50,223
YES, SIR.
CAN YOU USE IT

1529
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:52,433
TO SCAN THE INTERIOR
OF THE ANOMALY?

1530
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:57,354
POSSIBLY... THERE IS
A GREAT DEAL OF INTERFERENCE

1531
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:59,690
BUT I AM GETTING
SOME READINGS.

1532
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,359
THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL.

1533
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:03,694
WHAT IS IT?

1534
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,905
IT APPEARS THAT
OUR TACHYON PULSE

1535
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,783
IS CONVERGING WITH
TWO OTHER TACHYON PULSES

1536
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,868
AT THE CENTER
OF THE ANOMALY.

1537
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,203
THE TWO OTHER PULSES

1538
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:14,789
HAVE THE EXACT SAME
AMPLITUDE MODULATION

1539
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:16,457
AS OUR OWN PULSE.

1540
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:19,836
IT IS AS IF ALL THREE
ORIGINATED FROM THE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

1541
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:22,297
THREE PULSES...

1542
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:25,175
FROM THREE TIME PERIODS

1543
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:28,761
CONVERGING
AT ONE POINT IN SPACE.

1544
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:32,640
Data:
CAPTAIN, WHAT ARE YOU
SUGGESTING?

1545
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,773
COMPUTER,
WHERE IS ADMIRAL RIKER?

1546
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:43,818
Computer:
<i>Admiral Riker is in</i>
<i>Ten Forward.</i>

1547
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:57,623
THE SHIP HAS HELD UP
PRETTY WELL OVER THE YEARS.

1548
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,710
THEY TRIED TO DE-COMMISSION HER
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

1549
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,503
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES
OF BEING AN ADMIRAL

1550
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:06,132
IS YOU GET TO CHOOSE
YOUR OWN SHIP.

1551
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:10,220
WILL, HOW LONG IS THIS THING
BETWEEN YOU AND WORF

1552
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,013
GOING TO GO ON?

1553
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:14,807
IT'S BEEN GOING ON
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

1554
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:18,269
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
IT'S GOING TO END ANYTIME SOON.

1555
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:20,897
I SUSPECT THE LAST THING
COUNSELOR TROI WOULD HAVE WANTED

1556
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:23,649
IS FOR THE TWO OF YOU
TO BE ALIENATED.

1557
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,027
I AGREE.

1558
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,321
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO PUT IT BEHIND YOU.

1559
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:31,448
I TRIED AT DEANNA'S FUNERAL.

1560
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:34,577
HE WOULDN'T EVEN TALK WITH ME.

1561
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:37,454
MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOUGH
FOR HIM THEN.

1562
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:39,832
HE TOOK HER DEATH PRETTY HARD.

1563
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,959
OH, YEAH?

1564
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,170
WELL, HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE.

1565
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:50,634
I KNOW, BUT I THINK
IN HIS MIND,

1566
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:52,887
YOU WERE THE REASON
THAT HE AND DEANNA

1567
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:54,389
NEVER GOT TOGETHER.

1568
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:56,807
I NEVER DID ANYTHING
TO STAND IN HIS WAY.

1569
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:59,727
DIDN'T YOU, WILL?

1570
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:04,857
DID I?

1571
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:08,986
I DIDN'T WANT TO ADMIT
THAT IT WAS OVER.

1572
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:16,160
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WE
WOULD GET TOGETHER AGAIN

1573
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,371
AND THEN SHE WAS GONE.

1574
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:24,543
YOU THINK YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD, UNTIL...

1575
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,503
YEAH.

1576
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,092
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

1577
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:44,897
ENSIGN, HOW DO I GET
TO TEN FORWARD?

1578
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:49,110
IT'S FOUR DECKS DOWN, SIR--
SECTION 005.

1579
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,653
THANK YOU.

1580
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,913
( indistinct chattering )

1581
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:06,794
OH, MY GOD.

1582
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:11,757
WILL. WILL, I KNOW
WHY IT'S HAPPENING.

1583
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,217
I KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING
THE ANOMALY.

1584
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,802
WE HAVE TO GO BACK.

1585
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:16,971
THE ONLY PLACE WE'RE GOING
BACK TO, SIR, IS BED.

1586
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,597
DAMN IT, WILL,
I KNOW WHY IT'S HAPPENING!

1587
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:22,143
WE CAUSED THE ANOMALY
WITH THE TACHYON PULSE.

1588
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,811
IT HAPPENED
THREE TIMES, WILL.

1589
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:26,189
WE DID IT IN THREE
DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS.

1590
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,774
I THINK
YOU BETTER COME WITH ME.

1591
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,651
WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

1592
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,195
DAMN IT, I'M NOT STUPID!

1593
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:34,780
WILL, THE TACHYON PULSES--
THEY WERE USED

1594
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,409
IN THE SAME SPOT IN THREE
DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS.

1595
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:39,869
DON'T YOU SEE?

1596
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:42,121
WHEN THE TACHYON PULSE USED...

1597
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:43,289
I MEAN, UH...

1598
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,582
I MEAN,
WHEN THE<i> PASTEUR</i>

1599
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:48,336
USED THE TACHYON PULSE,
THEN, THEN...

1600
01:15:48,336 --> 01:15:49,586
WE, UH...

1601
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:51,547
I MEAN,
EVERYTHING STARTED, WILL.

1602
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,216
WE SET EVERYTHING
IN MOTION.

1603
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:56,511
IT... IT'S LIKE THE CHICKEN
AND THE EGG, WILL--

1604
01:15:56,511 --> 01:15:58,137
THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG!

1605
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:02,058
WE THINK IT STARTED
IN THE PAST, BUT IT DIDN'T.

1606
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:04,852
IT STARTED RIGHT HERE
IN THE FUTURE.

1607
01:16:04,852 --> 01:16:08,147
THAT'S WHY IT'S GETTING LARGER
IN THE PAST.

1608
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:10,691
I KNOW WHAT THE CAPTAIN
IS TALKING ABOUT.

1609
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:14,653
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
HE'S DESCRIBING A PARADOX.

1610
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:16,489
YES! RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

1611
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:17,740
INTRIGUING.

1612
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,158
IT IS POSSIBLE.

1613
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:22,703
WE COULD HAVE CAUSED
THE VERY ANOMALY

1614
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:24,747
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

1615
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:26,749
LET US ASSUME
FOR A MOMENT

1616
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:30,627
THAT THE CAPTAIN HAS BEEN
TRAVELING THROUGH TIME.

1617
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:34,507
LET US ALSO ASSUME
HE HAS INITIATED A TACHYON PULSE

1618
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:38,469
AT THE SAME COORDINATES
IN ALL THREE TIME PERIODS.

1619
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,555
IN THAT CASE, IT IS POSSIBLE

1620
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:43,891
THAT THE CONVERGENCE
OF THREE TACHYON PULSES

1621
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:46,227
COULD HAVE RUPTURED
THE SUBSPACE BARRIER

1622
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:48,438
AND CREATED
AN ANTI-TIME REACTION.

1623
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:50,398
I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING, DATA.

1624
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:51,732
AND BECAUSE ANTI-TIME

1625
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,277
OPERATES OPPOSITE
THE WAY NORMAL TIME DOES

1626
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:56,404
THE EFFECTS
WOULD TRAVEL BACKWARDS

1627
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:57,947
THROUGH THE SPACE-TIME
CONTINUUM.

1628
01:16:57,947 --> 01:16:59,574
YES, THAT'S WHY IT GETS LARGER
IN THE PAST.

1629
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:01,784
IT GROWS AS IT TRAVELS
BACKWARDS IN TIME.

1630
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:04,328
ALL RIGHT, JUST FOR THE MOMENT,
LET'S SAY THAT YOU'RE RIGHT.

1631
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,746
WHAT DO WE DO?
BACK, WILL.

1632
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,415
WE GO BACK
TO THE DEVRON SYSTEM.

1633
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:08,749
HE MAY BE RIGHT.

1634
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:11,001
IF WE GO BACK
TO THE DEVRON SYSTEM NOW

1635
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,628
WE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO SEE

1636
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,631
THE INITIAL FORMATION
OF THE ANOMALY.

1637
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,634
RIKER TO BRIDGE.

1638
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,803
SET A COURSE FOR
THE DEVRON SYSTEM, MAXIMUM WARP.

1639
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,138
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

1640
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:32,315
WORF, WE COULD USE A HAND.

1641
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:41,491
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

1642
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:47,121
ENTERING
THE DEVRON SYSTEM, SIR.

1643
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,747
FULL STOP.

1644
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:51,041
Data:
SENSORS ARE PICKING UP
A SMALL TEMPORAL ANOMALY

1645
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,251
OFF THE PORT BOW.

1646
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:53,628
ON SCREEN.

1647
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,844
I WAS RIGHT.

1648
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,805
La Forge:
IT'S AN ANTI-TIME ERUPTION

1649
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:07,308
IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FORMED
WITHIN THE LAST SIX HOURS.

1650
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:08,767
WE MUST STOP IT HERE

1651
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:11,354
SO THAT IT CAN'T TRAVEL
BACK THROUGH TIME.

1652
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:14,773
Riker:
MR. DATA, WE NEED A SOLUTION
AND WE NEED IT NOW.

1653
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,108
THE ANOMALY
IS BEING SUSTAINED

1654
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:17,734
BY THE CONTINUING
TACHYON PULSES

1655
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,236
FROM THE OTHER
TWO TIME PERIODS.

1656
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:21,155
I SUGGEST
SHUTTING THEM DOWN.

1657
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,366
THE NEXT TIME I'M THERE,
IT'S THE FIRST THING I'LL DO.

1658
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:25,201
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING MORE
WE CAN DO HERE?

1659
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:26,452
SEAL THE RUPTURE SOMEHOW?

1660
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:29,580
I'LL INVESTIGATE
THE OPTIONS.

1661
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,374
DATA, DISENGAGE
THE TACHYON PULSE.

1662
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:32,791
SIR?

1663
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,751
DO IT. THE CONVERGENCE
OF THE TACHYON PULSES

1664
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,919
FROM THE THREE TIME PERIODS

1665
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:37,421
IS WHAT IS CAUSING
THE ANOMALY.

1666
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,714
AYE, SIR.

1667
01:18:43,678 --> 01:18:45,721
IS THERE ANY CHANGE
IN THE ANOMALY?

1668
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:46,930
NO, SIR.

1669
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:49,183
DISENGAGE THE TACHYON PULSE.

1670
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:52,061
BUT WE HAVEN'T FINISHED
THE SCAN, SIR.

1671
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,230
I KNOW THAT.
BUT IT IS IMPERATIVE

1672
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,691
THAT YOU DISENGAGE
THE TACHYON PULSE IMMEDIATELY.

1673
01:18:56,691 --> 01:18:58,859
Data:
AYE, SIR. DISENGAGING.

1674
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:04,114
WHY ISN'T THE ANOMALY
BEING AFFECTED?

1675
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:06,617
WHY WOULD IT BE, SIR?

1676
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:11,706
I'VE SHUT OFF THE TACHYON PULSES
IN THE OTHER TIME PERIODS.

1677
01:19:11,706 --> 01:19:13,374
BUT IT HASN'T CHANGED
THE ANOMALY.

1678
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:15,418
IT REMAINS UNAFFECTED
HERE AS WELL, SIR.

1679
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:17,044
WHAT DO WE DO?

1680
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,879
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THIS THING
IS TO REPAIR THE RUPTURE

1681
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,172
AT THE FOCAL POINT

1682
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,965
WHERE TIME AND ANTI-TIME
ARE CONVERGING.

1683
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:23,551
HOW DO WE DO THAT?

1684
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:25,928
IT WOULD REQUIRE TAKING THE SHIP
INTO THE ANOMALY ITSELF.

1685
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:28,055
ONCE INSIDE, WE MAY BE ABLE
TO USE OUR ENGINES

1686
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:30,057
TO CREATE
A STATIC WARP SHELL.

1687
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,643
YEAH, DATA, THAT'S RIGHT.
AND THE SHELL WOULD ACT

1688
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:34,311
AS AN ARTIFICIAL
SUBSPACE BARRIER

1689
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,979
SEPARATING TIME
AND ANTI-TIME.

1690
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:37,231
COLLAPSING THE ANOMALY

1691
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,441
AND RESTORING
THE NORMAL FLOW OF TIME.

1692
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:39,816
BUT THIS WOULD HAVE
TO BE DONE

1693
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:41,235
IN THE OTHER
TWO TIME PERIODS, AS WELL.

1694
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:42,903
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.

1695
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:45,864
THE ANOMALY IS SO MUCH LARGER
IN THE OTHER TWO TIME PERIODS

1696
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,658
IT MAY BE DANGEROUS
TO TAKE THE SHIP IN.

1697
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:49,034
TAKE THE SHIP
IN WHERE, SIR?

1698
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,746
INTO THE ANOMALY, CHIEF.

1699
01:19:51,746 --> 01:19:53,997
LAY IN A COURSE
FOR THE EXACT CENTER

1700
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:56,875
AND TRANSFER ALL AVAILABLE POWER
TO THE SHIELDS.

1701
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,378
SIR, CAN YOU GIVE US
SOME EXPLANATION?

1702
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,297
NO, LIEUTENANT, I CANNOT.

1703
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:04,091
CAPTAIN, SO FAR,
WE'VE OBEYED EVERY ORDER

1704
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:06,093
NO MATTER HOW FARFETCHED
IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED.

1705
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:07,762
BUT IF WE'RE TO RISK

1706
01:20:07,762 --> 01:20:09,472
THE SAFETY
OF THE SHIP AND CREW,

1707
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:12,933
I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK YOU
FOR AN EXPLANATION.

1708
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:15,311
I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS,
LIEUTENANT

1709
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:18,021
AND I KNOW
THAT IF I WERE IN YOUR POSITION

1710
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:20,065
I WOULD BE DOING
THE SAME THING:

1711
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,525
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.

1712
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,235
BUT YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO FIND ANY,

1713
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:26,363
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY
TO GIVE YOU.

1714
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:29,158
I KNOW IT IS DIFFICULT
FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND,

1715
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,285
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE THE SHIP

1716
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:33,788
INTO THE VERY CENTER
OF THE PHENOMENON

1717
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:36,749
AND CREATE
A STATIC WARP SHELL.

1718
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:41,504
NOW, THIS WILL PUT
THE SHIP AT RISK.

1719
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:43,756
QUITE FRANKLY,
WE MAY NOT SURVIVE.

1720
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:46,175
BUT I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE
THAT I'M DOING THIS

1721
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:47,593
FOR A GREATER PURPOSE,

1722
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:50,137
AND THAT WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE

1723
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:52,973
IS MORE THAN ANY OF YOU
CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

1724
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,603
I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR DOUBTS
ABOUT ME.

1725
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:59,188
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

1726
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,148
ABOUT THE SHIP.

1727
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,859
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT

1728
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,195
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ONLY
BEEN TOGETHER FOR A SHORT TIME,

1729
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:10,783
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE
THE FINEST CREW IN THE FLEET.

1730
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:16,664
AND I WOULD TRUST EACH OF YOU
WITH MY LIFE.

1731
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:21,669
SO I'M ASKING YOU
FOR A LEAP OF FAITH...

1732
01:21:23,713 --> 01:21:25,715
AND TO TRUST ME.

1733
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,640
SHIELDS UP, MAXIMUM STRENGTH.

1734
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,226
BOOSTING FIELD INTEGRITY
TO THE WARP NACELLES.

1735
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:39,019
WE MAY ENCOUNTER
SHEARING FORCES

1736
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:40,563
ONCE WE ENTER
THE ANOMALY.

1737
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:43,148
I AM PREPARING TO INITIATE
A STATIC WARP SHELL.

1738
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:44,734
COURSE LAID IN, SIR.

1739
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:47,236
ALL DECKS REPORT READY, SIR.

1740
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:48,696
TAKE US IN, CHIEF.

1741
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:51,365
CAPTAIN, I HAVE AN IDEA.

1742
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:52,616
IF WE TAKE THE SHIP

1743
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:54,410
TO THE CENTER OF THE ANOMALY...

1744
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,662
Both:
AND CREATE A STATIC WARP SHELL

1745
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:58,914
YOU COULD REPAIR THE BARRIER
AND COLLAPSE THE ANOMALY.

1746
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,082
YES, SIR.

1747
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:02,167
MR. DATA,
YOU ARE A CLEVER MAN...

1748
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:05,379
IN ANY TIME PERIOD.

1749
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:07,423
HELM, LAY IN A COURSE
FOR THE CENTER OF THE ANOMALY.

1750
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,383
AND PREPARE TO INITIATE
A STATIC WARP SHELL.

1751
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:11,510
Helm:
AYE, SIR.

1752
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,763
THE OTHER TWO<i> ENTERPRISES--</i>
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

1753
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:16,724
VERY WELL.
ENSIGN, TAKE US IN.

1754
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:19,184
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

1755
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,313
WE'RE ENTERING THE ANOMALY, SIR.

1756
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:26,108
ALL HANDS
BRACE FOR IMPACT.

1757
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,652
Yar:
THE TEMPORAL ENERGY
IS INTERFERING WITH MAIN POWER.

1758
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,654
SWITCHING TO--
AUXILIARY POWER!

1759
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,740
I'M HAVING TROUBLE KEEPING
THE IMPULSE ENGINES ONLINE.

1760
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:35,367
I'VE GOT POWER FLUCTUATIONS ALL
ACROSS THE BOARD.

1761
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,952
MAINTAIN COURSE
AND SPEED.

1762
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:40,038
MR. DATA, HOW LONG
UNTIL WE REACH THE CENTER?

1763
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:42,082
AT LEAST 30 SECONDS, SIR.

1764
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,962
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

1765
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,006
WE'VE ENTERED THE ANOMALY.

1766
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,884
WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTER, SIR.

1767
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,761
INITIATE WARP SHELL.

1768
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:57,723
INITIATING
STATIC WARP SHELL NOW.

1769
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:59,892
IS IT HAVING ANY EFFECT?

1770
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,310
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.

1771
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,563
A NEW SUBSPACE BARRIER
APPEARS TO BE FORMING.

1772
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:07,524
CAPTAIN, THE SENSORS
ARE PICKING UP TWO OTHER SHIPS.

1773
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:09,860
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

1774
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:31,340
CAPTAIN, IT APPEARS
TO BE WORKING.

1775
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,217
THE ANOMALY IS BEGINNING
TO COLLAPSE. I THINK--

1776
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:36,887
THE TEMPORAL ENERGY IS RUPTURING
OUR WARP CONTAINMENT SYSTEM.

1777
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:38,430
WE MUST EJECT THE CORE.

1778
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,557
NO. WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN
THE STATIC WARP SHELL

1779
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:41,976
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

1780
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,438
WE'RE LOSING CONTAINMENT,
CAPTAIN.

1781
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:47,731
I CAN'T STOP IT.

1782
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:49,024
IT'S GOING TO...

1783
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:54,070
Picard:
TRANSFER EMERGENCY POWER

1784
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:56,198
TO THE ANTI-MATTER
CONTAINMENT SYSTEM.

1785
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:58,408
I'M TRYING, BUT THERE'S A LOT
OF INTERFERENCE.

1786
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,661
THE WARP SHELL IS DEFINITELY
HAVING AN EFFECT, SIR.

1787
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:02,329
THE ANOMALY IS COLLAPSING.

1788
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:03,831
I CAN'T HOLD IT.

1789
01:24:03,831 --> 01:24:05,708
THE CONTAINMENT SYSTEM IS GOING.

1790
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,083
MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.

1791
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:08,836
MR. La FORGE...

1792
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,758
BOTH OF THE OTHER SHIPS
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

1793
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:16,635
TWO DOWN, ONE TO GO.

1794
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,387
DATA, REPORT.

1795
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,181
THE ANOMALY IS NEARLY COLLAPSED.
WE'RE LOSING CONTAINMENT.

1796
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:23,350
GOOD-BYE, JEAN-LUC.
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.

1797
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,935
YOU HAD SUCH POTENTIAL.

1798
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:27,897
BUT THEN AGAIN ALL GOOD THINGS
MUST COME TO AN END.

1799
01:24:27,897 --> 01:24:29,356
CONTAINMENT FIELD
IS AT CRITICAL!

1800
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:31,400
I'M LOSING IT!

1801
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,840
THE CONTINUUM DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD IT IN YOU, JEAN-LUC,

1802
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,508
BUT I KNEW YOU DID.

1803
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:02,514
ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT WORKED?

1804
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:03,933
WE COLLAPSED THE ANOMALY?

1805
01:25:03,933 --> 01:25:05,893
IS THAT ALL
THIS MEANT TO YOU?

1806
01:25:05,893 --> 01:25:07,436
JUST ANOTHER
SPATIAL ANOMALY?

1807
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,979
JUST ANOTHER DAY
AT THE OFFICE?

1808
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:10,397
DID IT WORK?

1809
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:11,941
WELL YOU'RE HERE, AREN'T YOU?

1810
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:14,651
YOU'RE TALKING TO ME,
AREN'T YOU?

1811
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:15,986
WHAT ABOUT MY CREW?

1812
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:17,571
( scoffs )

1813
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:19,865
THE ANOMALY...
MY SHIP... MY CREW--

1814
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:23,452
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR FISH TOO.

1815
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:26,663
IF IT PUTS YOUR MIND AT EASE,
YOU'VE SAVED HUMANITY...

1816
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:28,749
ONCE AGAIN.

1817
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:35,255
THANK YOU.

1818
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:37,466
FOR WHAT?

1819
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:40,761
YOU HAD A HAND
IN HELPING ME GET OUT OF THIS.

1820
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:44,681
I WAS THE ONE
THAT GOT YOU INTO IT--

1821
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:48,268
A DIRECTIVE FROM THE CONTINUUM.

1822
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:50,854
THE PART ABOUT
THE HELPING HAND, THOUGH...

1823
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:53,440
WAS MY IDEA.

1824
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:01,657
I SINCERELY HOPE

1825
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:06,161
THAT THIS IS THE LAST TIME
THAT I FIND MYSELF HERE.

1826
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:09,205
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU, JEAN-LUC?

1827
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:12,292
THE TRIAL NEVER ENDS.

1828
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:14,294
WE WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU HAD THE ABILITY

1829
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,755
TO EXPAND YOUR MIND
AND YOUR HORIZONS.

1830
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:20,050
AND FOR ONE BRIEF MOMENT,
YOU DID.

1831
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,969
WHEN I REALIZED
THE PARADOX.

1832
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,470
EXACTLY.

1833
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,056
FOR THAT ONE FRACTION
OF A SECOND

1834
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,559
YOU WERE OPEN TO OPTIONS
YOU HAD NEVER CONSIDERED.

1835
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:33,313
THAT IS THE EXPLORATION
THAT AWAITS YOU.

1836
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:36,692
NOT MAPPING STARS
AND STUDYING NEBULAE,

1837
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:42,739
BUT CHARTING THE UNKNOWN
POSSIBILITIES OF EXISTENCE.

1838
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:45,826
Q, WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME?

1839
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:55,460
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

1840
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:59,048
IN ANY CASE,
I'LL BE WATCHING.

1841
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:00,465
AND IF YOU'RE VERY LUCKY

1842
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:04,594
I'LL DROP BY TO SAY HELLO
FROM TIME TO TIME.

1843
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:09,141

I'LL GET BACK TO BED.

ABOUT HOW WE ALL CHANGED
AND DRIFTED APART.

WHAT'S TO COME?

WE'VE ALWAYS HEARD

ABOUT NOT POLLUTING

THIS SITUATION IS UNIQUE.

THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN CHANGES

IN THE WAY
THIS TIMELINE IS UNFOLDING.

1878
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:53,912
THE FUTURE WE EXPERIENCE
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE DIFFERENT

1879
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:56,372
FROM THE ONE
THE CAPTAIN ENCOUNTERED.

1880
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:58,125
MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE TOLD US.

01:28:58,125 --> 01:29:00,502
KNOWING WHAT HAPPENS
IN THAT FUTURE

1882

NEVER HAPPEN.
