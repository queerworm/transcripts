00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:05,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47751.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:09,166
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has arrived</i>
<i>at Starbase 310</i>

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,583
<i>for a meeting</i>
<i>with Fleet Admiral Necheyev.</i>

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,792
<i>This visit has also given us</i>
<i>the opportunity</i>

5
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:17,083
<i>to pick up a member</i>
<i>of the family.</i>

6
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:22,333
Here you are--
your very own quarters.

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,041
And they're as far away
from mine as possible

8
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,333
so you don't even have to
see me if you don't want to.

9
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,250
Mom, you know that's
not why I asked

10
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,875
for my own quarters
this time.

11
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:31,417
You don't have to explain.

12
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,166
There comes a time
in a young man's life

13
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,792
when he doesn't want to stay
with his poor, senile mother.

14
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,375
I understand.
I'll come visit you

15
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:39,834
in the old doctor's
home every Sunday.

16
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,417
(<i> door chimes</i> )

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,542
Come in.

18
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,375
So... is there
a runaway cadet in here?

19
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:49,959
If so, we may have
to call security.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,959
Welcome back, Wes.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,959
Thanks.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,583
So, how's life
at the academy?

23
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,000
It's great.

24
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,625
It's great, but it's
good to have a break.

25
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,291
DATA:
I was, of course,

26
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,458
not serious about
calling security.

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,750
It was a joke.

28
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:06,333
I got it, Data.

29
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,834
So, you just going
to lounge around

30
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,250
while we all have work
to do around here?

31
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,250
I'm sure I can find some
time to help you, sir.

32
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,667
No, Wes.
Enjoy your vacation.

33
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,125
I'm sure
you've earned it.

34
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,583
Thanks.

35
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,834
Well, I think
we'd better let
you settle in.

36
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,458
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Say, Wes, don't, uh...

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,709
don't sleep your<i> whole</i>
vacation away, all right?

38
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,583
Good-bye, Wes.

39
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,291
Oh... it's good
to have you home, son.

40
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,542
Thanks, Mom.

41
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,041
Really.

42
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:20,250
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

43
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:24,417
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

44
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

45
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,792
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

46
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:34,417
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

47
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:39,166
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

48
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,291
Admiral Necheyev has
just beamed aboard.

49
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,875
She's being escorted
right here.
Good.

50
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:48,250
Earl Grey tea,
watercress sandwiches
and Bularian canapés?

51
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,041
Are you up
for a promotion?

52
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,500
I am trying to establish
a new relationship
with the admiral.

53
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:57,166
There has been a certain
amount of tension
between us in the past.

54
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,000
"Tension" is hardly
the word I'd use.

55
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,083
Well, I am trying to get
things off on a better
note this time.

56
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,250
I want her to feel
at ease, I want her

57
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,333
to feel that she's welcome
onboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

58
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,166
Is there any reason
she shouldn't feel
welcome here?

59
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,583
We don't have
to like her, Will,

60
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,083
but we have to
follow her orders,
and maintaining

61
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,083
this atmosphere
of confrontation
serves no purpose.

62
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,291
Admiral Necheyev,
welcome onboard
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

63
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,500
Thank you, Captain.

64
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,000
You may leave,
Commander Riker.

65
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,458
Thank you,
Admiral. Captain.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,583
May I offer you some
refreshments, Admiral?

67
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,792
I'll come right
to the point, Captain.

68
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,583
There's a situation
that's developed

69
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,917
on the Cardassian
border that...

70
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,083
Are those
Bularian canapés?

71
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,291
Oh, as a matter
of fact, they are.

72
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,875
I... spoke with your aide,
Commander Wrightwell,

73
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:50,917
and he said that you were
particularly fond of them.

74
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,667
That was very thoughtful,
Captain.

75
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,834
Thank you.

76
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,875
Please.

77
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:04,083
You were saying
about the Cardassians...

78
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,083
Yes. The Federation
has just completed

79
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,291
a very long and drawn-out
series of negotiations

80
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:14,834
regarding the final
status of our border
with the Cardassians.

81
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,166
These will be the
official boundaries.

82
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,625
I see.

83
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,125
You'll notice a
demilitarized zone

84
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,917
has also been created
along the border.

85
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,375
Neither side
will be permitted to
place military outposts,

86
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:29,709
conduct fleet exercises,
or station warships

87
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,083
anywhere in the
demilitarized area.

88
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:37,458
This border places
several Federation colonies
in Cardassian territory

89
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,709
and some Cardassian
colonies in ours.

90
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,291
This agreement
is far from perfect.

91
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,291
Neither side got
everything they wanted

92
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,333
but every side got
something, and as
someone once said,

93
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,291
"Diplomacy is the art
of the possible."

94
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,125
Those colonies
finding themselves

95
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,750
on the wrong side
of the border
will have to be moved.

96
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,458
Well, the colonists
are not going to be
happy about that.

97
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,542
Some of them have
been there for decades.

98
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:08,625
It won't be easy,
but it's a reasonable
price to pay for peace.

99
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:12,375
Your mission will be
to evacuate the
colony on Dorvan V.

100
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:16,125
Dorvan V?

101
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,917
Isn't that where
the group of North
American Indians settled?

102
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,875
Yes, they've been there
for about 20 years.

103
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:28,750
They've established a
village in a small valley
on the southern continent.

104
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:31,291
Is something wrong?

105
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:36,917
Admiral, centuries ago,
these North American Indians

106
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,917
were forcibly displaced
from their ancestral lands.

107
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,750
These settlers on Dorvan V
originally left Earth
more than 200 years ago

108
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,750
in order to preserve
their cultural identity.

109
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,083
I am aware of that,
Captain.

110
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,375
You see, Admiral,
there are some

111
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:54,208
very disturbing
historical parallels here.

112
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,000
Once more, they are being
asked to leave their
homes because of a...

113
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,583
a political decision
that has been taken
by a distant government.

114
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,333
An Indian representative
was included

115
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,709
in the deliberations of
the Federation council.

116
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,166
His objections were
noted, discussed, but
ultimately rejected.

117
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:17,667
Captain,
the Indians on Dorvan
are a nomadic group

118
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,750
that have settled there
only 20 years ago

119
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:22,500
and, at that time,
they were warned
that the planet

120
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,917
was hotly disputed
by the Cardassians.

121
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,333
The bottom line is,
they never should

122
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,834
have gone there
in the first place.

123
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,458
Granted, but to go to
them now, after 20 years,

124
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,458
and ask them to leave
what is now their home...

125
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,834
I made that same argument
with the Federation council

126
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,959
but it took three years
to negotiate this treaty.

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,041
Some concessions had
to be made, and this
was one of them.

128
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,834
What if these Indians
refuse to be evacuated?

129
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:52,083
Then your orders will be
to remove them by whatever
means are necessary.

130
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:57,667
I understand your moral
objections, Captain.

131
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,917
If you wish,
I can find someone else

132
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,291
to command the<i> Enterprise</i>
for this mission.

133
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,542
That will not
be necessary, Admiral.

134
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:17,083
I don't envy you this task,
but I do believe it is
for the greater good.

135
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,083
I understand.

136
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:26,125
And, Captain...

137
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,542
thank you for...

138
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,500
making me feel welcome.

139
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:35,458
You will always be welcome
aboard this ship, Admiral.

140
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,792
Thanks, Ensign.
Mm-hmm.

141
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:50,709
Hey, Wes, there you are.
Come here for a second.

142
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,500
I've got something
I want to show you.

143
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:57,667
Come on, come on.
You got to take
a look at this.

144
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,834
Now, remember how we
always used to talk

145
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,542
about improving
quantum efficiency

146
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,083
by creating a new
plasma-dyne relay?

147
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,041
Well... take a look...

148
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,333
at this.

149
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,792
WES:
You've only got
one microfusion
interrelay in there?

150
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,709
Your converter interface
will never hold up.

151
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey, I ran
these diagnostics myself.

152
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,792
This little baby
will withstand

153
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:24,542
over 500 cochranes
of warp field stress.

154
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:28,834
I don't think so.
You better put a second
phase inverter in there.

155
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,083
Look at your
subprocessor matrix.
It needs an overhaul.

156
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:37,041
Well, that may be
your opinion, Cadet,
but I stand by my work.

157
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,083
Read the latest paper
from Dr. Vassbinder.

158
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,792
He has brilliant
new theories

159
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:44,250
on warp-propulsion
interrelays.

160
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,417
He'd say all this stuff
is obsolete.

161
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,875
(<i> sighing</i> )

162
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,583
I don't know what's
gotten into you, Wes.

163
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,208
Look, do you want
my help or not?

164
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,625
With this kind of an
attitude, absolutely not.

165
00:09:58,667 --> 00:09:59,709
You're dismissed.

166
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,875

<i>Captain's Log,</i>

<i>He has agreed to meet</i>
<i>with us this afternoon</i>
<i>to discuss the situation.</i>

171
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,375
Anthwara, there's
very little I can do.

172
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,583
The decision about
this planet was made

173
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,291
at the very highest
level of Starfleet.

174
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,375
Do you know how long we
have searched for a home?

175
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:37,417
Almost 200 years.
Then we found this world.

176
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,000
Can you blame us for not
wanting to give it up?

177
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,709
I understand, and I respect
your people's long journey,

178
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,542
but I believe
that I can help you
to find a new home.

179
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,250
TROI:
As you can see, there
are three other planets

180
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,709
in this sector that have
environmental conditions

181
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,125
similar to those
here on Dorvan V.

182
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,917
They're all
uninhabited and could
be colonized immediately.

183
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,333
And if none of these worlds
meets with your approval,

184
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,792
then we will find you
other choices.

185
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:04,250
You do not understand,
Captain.

186
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:10,834
The choice of this planet
was not only because of
environmental conditions.

187
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,500
There were other more...

188
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,542
intangible concerns
as well.

189
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:27,000
When I came here
20 years ago...

190
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:34,166
I was welcomed
by the mountains,
the rivers, the sky.

191
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,625
Anthwara, he's
laughing at you.

192
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:40,625
He thinks you're talking
about old superstition
and nonsense.

193
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,583
This is not true.

194
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,500
I have the deepest
respect for your beliefs

195
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,875
and the meaning
that they hold
for your people.

196
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,959
Then you can respect
the fact

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,041
that<i> this</i> planet holds
a deep spiritual
significance for us.

198
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:05,083
It has taken us two centuries
to find this place.

199
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,583
We do not want to spend
another 200 years

200
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:13,375
searching for what
we already have.

201
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,333
Captain, I suggest
we adjourn--

202
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,333
allow us all time
to think about
what's been said.

203
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,500
Agreed.

204
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:23,709
We will reconvene
tomorrow.

205
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,750
And in the meantime,
I would like
to invite you all

206
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,792
to join us this evening
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

207
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,917
Thank you.
We look forward to it.

208
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:45,208
Ever since
you've come onboard,

209
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,000
you've been moody,
sullen, and rude.

210
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,166
What's going on?

211
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,709
Nothing. I just want
to be left alone.

212
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,834
That incident
in engineering
was inexcusable.

213
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,375
That is my business.

214
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,458
I don't need you telling
me how to behave.

215
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,000
I shouldn't have to.

216
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,875
You're a fourth-year
Starfleet cadet.

217
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,542
You should have
a certain level
of maturity.

218
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,792
Maybe I am sick
of following rules
and regulations.

219
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,667
Maybe I'm sick of living
up to everyone else's
expectations.

220
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,875
Did you ever
think of that?

221
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,750
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

222
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:21,542
I have been fascinated,

223
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,458
looking into the
history and traditions
of your people,

224
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,375
and I was very interested
to learn that your
Grandfather Katowa

225
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:33,125
was the man who first led
the group of Indians

226
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,750
from Earth initially,
more than 200 years ago.

227
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,709
Hmm. There was a great
deal of opposition.

228
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,417
Even my own father
was against it.

229
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:46,250
But when Katowa
made his decision,
it was final.

230
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,875
My father never said
another word.

231
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,875
It's never easy to
leave one's home...

232
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:55,041
the safe and the familiar.

233
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,917
But there are times when...

234
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,500
the greater good
demands that certain...

235
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,375
sacrifices are made.

236
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:05,667
I'm sure
that was something

237
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,542
that your grandfather
understood.

238
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,291
So does his grandson.

239
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,166
There are also times...

240
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,875
when a people
sacrificed too much...

241
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:23,333
...when a people must
hold on to what we have,

242
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,125
even against
overwhelming opposition.

243
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,959
What do you know about
your family, Captain?

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,375
Um, well, a great
deal, actually.

245
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,083
My father was
a strong believer

246
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,208
in passing on the
traditions and history
of a family.

247
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,041
I would like to know
more about your family.

248
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,667
<i>We</i> have strong ties
to our ancestors.

249
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,041
We believe their actions
guide us... even now.

250
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,333
Knowing more
about your family

251
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,125
might help me
to better understand you.

252
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:59,041
Besides, it
is always good

253
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:04,625
to understand
one's adversary
in any negotiation.

254
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,750
I hope that by the
end of this matter,

255
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:10,083
you will
no longer look on me
as an adversary.

256
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,291
My family.
Well, um...

257
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,208
our roots in Western
Europe go back to the
time of Charlemagne.

258
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,083
There is a record
of a nobleman...

259
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,792
Sorry I'm late.

260
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:27,041
We'll talk
about it later.

261
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,875
MAN:
Wesley Crusher?

262
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,917
Yes?

263
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,792
I am Lakanta.

264
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:57,041
It's nice to meet you.

265
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,041
Can I get you
a drink or something?

266
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,917
I have known...

267
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,709
that you were coming to us
for the past two years.

268
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:19,500
Two years ago...

269
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:23,709
I went into the habak
and began a vision quest,

270
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,125
and while I was there,
I saw many things,

271
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:31,125
talked to many animals,
many spirits...

272
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,041
and I saw you.

273
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,625
I don't think
I understand.

274
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:43,250
I know why you came
to us, Wesley--

275
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:48,583
to find the answers
that you seek.

276
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,125
I just don't know
what to do, Jean-Luc.

277
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,917
It's as if somebody
took my son away

278
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,625
and left this stranger
in his place.

279
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,709
But in a sense, that's
exactly what happened.

280
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,166
When Wesley left
the<i> Enterprise</i>
three years ago,

281
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,542
he was a boy,
and now he has
returned a young man.

282
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:17,166
And that can't be
easy for a mother
or a son.

283
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,792
But it's gone beyond
just the two of us.

284
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:22,458
Yes, I heard about the
incident with Geordi.

285
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,625
Have you heard what
happened in the academy?

286
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,834
I called
Admiral Brand today.

287
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,709
She said his grades
are dropping,

288
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,583
that he's becoming
remote and defensive.

289
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,208
If he's not careful,
he's going to wash
out next term.

290
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,542
Maybe... maybe you should
talk to him, Jean-Luc.

291
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,333
Maybe it's the kind
of thing that a boy--

292
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,291
a<i> man--</i> needs to discuss
with another man.

293
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,500
I don't think he wants
either of us to talk
to him right now.

294
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:45,792
But he needs our help.

295
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:48,250
But, Beverly, he's
got to<i> want</i> that help.

296
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,375
If he doesn't, then
any efforts on our part

297
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,041
could only push him
further away.

298
00:17:53,083 --> 00:18:00,375
He's-- he's got
to... work this out
for himself.

299
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,291
How long have you
been watching me?

300
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,625
Since you beamed down.

301
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,291
Well, I'm here.

302
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,333
What should I do?

303
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,375
I don't know.

304
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:26,291
I thought you said
you were going to help me
find some answers.

305
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,500
Answers
to your questions.

306
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:32,834
Tell me about this habak.

307
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,875
You said you had some
kind of vision there?

308
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,917
The habak is holy to us.

309
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:46,458
We hold our rituals
and our ceremonies there.

310
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,125
It's sacred to us.

311
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,250
What's sacred to you,
Wesley?

312
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,667
I don't know.

313
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,125
I mean, I think
a lot of things
are important.

314
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,583
I have a lot of
respect for things,

315
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:04,041
but I don't really
consider anything sacred.

316
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,208
Look around us.

317
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,041
What do you think
is sacred to us here?

318
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,250
Maybe the necklace
you're wearing?

319
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,417
The designs on the walls?

320
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:22,583
Everything
is sacred to us.

321
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,375
The buildings,
the food, the sky,

322
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:30,834
the dirt beneath
your feet and you.

323
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:37,917
Whether you believe
in your spirit or not,
we believe in it.

324
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:42,041
You are a sacred
person here, Wesley.

325
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,083
I think that's the
first time anyone's used

326
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,291
<i>that</i> particular word
to describe me.

327
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:55,041
So, if you are sacred,
then you<i> must</i> treat
yourself with respect.

328
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:59,000
To do otherwise
is to desecrate
something that is holy.

329
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,208
Is that what you think
I've been doing?

330
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,083
Only you can
decide that.

331
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:11,417
I guess I haven't
had a lot of respect
for myself lately.

332
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:19,083
Then perhaps it's time
for your own vision
quest to begin.

333
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:31,792
Anthwara, I deeply regret
that we have not been able
to reach an agreement.

334
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:37,792
But-- and I must be
blunt-- I cannot take
no for an answer.

335
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:42,083
This planet will be
handed over to the
Cardassian government

336
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,458
in accordance with the terms
of the border agreement.

337
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,125
I'm very sorry, but
you will have to leave.

338
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,917
And if we do not?

339
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:56,166
Then I will be forced...
to remove you

340
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,625
by whatever means
are necessary.

341
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:01,834
We know you will
not take us from
this land, Captain.

342
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,875
I may regret it,
but I am not able...

343
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:09,083
When you first came to us,
we did not know

344
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,750
why<i> you</i> were sent
by the Federation,

345
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,959
but we knew there
must be a good reason.

346
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,500
To us, nothing that
happens is truly random.

347
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:27,166
So, we searched
for the true reason
you were sent,

348
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,667
and we did not find it
until last night.

349
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:34,333
Are you familiar
with the Pueblo
Revolt of 1680?

350
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,291
I am.

351
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:40,291
Several Indian tribes
rose up to overthrow
their Spanish overlords

352
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,875
and drove them
out of what is now
called New Mexico.

353
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:49,125
Ten years later,
the Spanish returned
to reconquer the area.

354
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:55,291
They were brutal.
I would use the word...
"savage."

355
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,041
They killed hundreds
of our people.

356
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,583
Thousands more
were maimed.

357
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:05,583
The name of one
of the soldiers

358
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:10,250
was Javier Maribona...

359
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:15,542
Picard...
your ancestor.

360
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:21,083
I'm not aware of this
incident or of the
man you named...

361
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:25,250
...and this happened
more than 700 years ago.

362
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,417
I do not see what
bearing it can have...

363
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,166
That is why you
have come to us--

364
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:35,500
to erase a stain of blood

365
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:41,542
worn by your family
for 23 generations.

366
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,875
(<i> door opens</i> )

367
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:56,333
(<i> dog barking</i> )

368
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,083
Mr. Worf,
what is going on?

369
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:04,041
We have unwelcome
visitors, sir.

370
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,709
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

371
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,917
I am Gul Evek.

372
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:22,458
What are all these
people still doing here?

373
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,000
The evacuation should be
well underway by now.

374
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,875
May I have a word
with you... alone?

375
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,625
(<i> sighing</i> )

376
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,333
As you wish.

377
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,500
Wait here.

378
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,667
It was my understanding
that there would be

379
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:46,166
no Cardassian presence here
for another six weeks.

380
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:50,000
Your arrival here may
have upset some very
delicate negotiations.

381
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,750
Negotiations?
The status of this planet

382
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,542
has been settled.
What are you negotiating?

383
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,792
I will be very happy
to explain that to you,

384
00:23:56,834 --> 00:24:00,750
but for now, I must
ask you and your men
to leave immediately.

385
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:01,875
Captain,
we have been sent here

386
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:03,417
to perform
a preliminary survey

387
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,458
of all the buildings
and equipment being
left behind.

388
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,041
I have no intention
of leaving

389
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,709
until our mission
is complete.

390
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,083
Very well.

391
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,625
Complete your mission,
but remember,

392
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:20,542
this is Federation
territory, Gul Evek,
and until that changes,

393
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:25,875
these people are under
<i>my</i> jurisdiction and
I will protect them.

394
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:27,458
Is that a threat?

395
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,959
It's a fact.

396
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,875
Bear that in mind while
you conduct your "survey."

397
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:56,667
This is the habak,
the focal point
of our lives.

398
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:58,667
Strangers are
not welcome here.

399
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:01,375
When I asked to come
here, you said that
it would be...

400
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:05,166
You're not a stranger.
I told you.

401
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,166
I've seen you here before.

402
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,542
What are those figures?

403
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:15,375
They are Mansara--
dolls that represent

404
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:18,166
the different spirits
that have come to
this place.

405
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,667
That one looks
like a Klingon.

406
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:27,417
Yes. Our culture
is rooted in the past,

407
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:31,208
but it's not
limited to the past.

408
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:35,542
The spirits of
the Klingon, the Vulcan,
and the Ferengi

409
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:40,166
come to us just as
the bear and the
coyote, the parrot.

410
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,583
There's no difference.

411
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:48,667
What should I do?

412
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,125
Start the fire.

413
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,000
And then sit and wait.

414
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,625
What am I waiting for?

415
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:58,709
This is<i> your</i> journey,
Wesley.

416
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,542
I can open the door,
but only you can go
through it.

417
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,542
Admiral, the Indian
council is adamant.

418
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,458
They refuse to
leave Dorvan V.

419
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,375
Is there any indication
the tribal council

420
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:17,667
will change their position
in the near future?

421
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,750
No, sir.

422
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,583
Then I see
no other choice.

423
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,834
Admiral, I have
every reason to believe

424
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,375
that they will resist
any attempt to remove them.

425
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,583
I strongly urge
you to request

426
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,709
an emergency session
of the Federation council.

427
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,250
The issue of Dorvan V
must be reopened.

428
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,458
Captain, I made that
request two days ago.

429
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,458
The answer was no.

430
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,333
I'm sorry,
but you have your orders.

431
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,458
Starfleet out.

432
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,083
So much for your reprieve
from Starfleet.

433
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:48,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

434
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,834
Anthwara believes...

435
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:57,291
that I am responsible
for the crimes

436
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:00,208
of one of my ancestors
against his people.

437
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,041
Do you believe that?

438
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:05,917
No, of course not.
I respect his belief,

439
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:12,250
but I do not see
how it can have any
bearing on this mission.

440
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:15,792
But even so,
I can't help wondering...

441
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:23,792
if a dark chapter
in my family's history
is about to be repeated.

442
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:27,375
If those people
take up arms against us,

443
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:30,583
then I cannot foresee
the consequences.

444
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:35,250
Mr. Worf, will you
come in here a moment?

445
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,542
Aye, sir.

446
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:48,291
Mr. Worf, will you
begin preparations

447
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,959
to remove the inhabitants
from Dorvan V?

448
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,583
Aye, sir.

449
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:34,291
Wesley.

450
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:37,083
Dad?

451
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,667
You've reached
the end, Wesley.

452
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:42,041
The end of what?

453
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:46,166
This journey--
one you started
a long time ago...

454
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,667
when I left you
and your mother.

455
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:51,208
You mean when you died.

456
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,583
You set out on a journey
that wasn't your own.

457
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:57,875
Now it's time to find
a path that is truly yours.

458
00:28:57,917 --> 00:29:00,667
Don't follow<i> me</i>
any further.

459
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,709
I don't understand.

460
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,000
Yes, you do.

461
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:06,792
It's just hard
for you to accept.

462
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:10,834
Good-bye, Wesley,
and good luck.

463
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:14,500
Dad, wait!

464
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:15,709
(<i> gasps</i> )

465
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,709
Mr. Crusher.

466
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:42,458
Are you all right?

467
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,250
Yeah, Worf, I'm fine.

468
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:47,375
Lay out a
confinement beam trace

469
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:50,333
along the southeastern
side of the village,
but be discreet.

470
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,000
We do not wish to
alarm these people.

471
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,083
Yes, sir.

472
00:29:56,709 --> 00:30:01,875
Worf?
What are you doing?

473
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:07,834
We are laying out
transporter coordinates
for a security perimeter.

474
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:11,792
It may be necessary
to remove these people
by force.

475
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:20,583
Worf...
we can't do this.

476
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:24,583
These people deserve
better than to be
removed from their homes.

477
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,875
I understand, but
now is not the time.

478
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,792
Do you know what
they're trying to do?

479
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:31,291
They're preparing to
beam you away and take
you to their ship.

480
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,250
You're not going to let
them do that, are you?

481
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,250
No.

482
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,959
No, we won't.

483
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,667
Leave now.

484
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:39,875
Yeah!

485
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,041
Inexcusable.

486
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:50,709
You defied the orders
of the ranking officer
on the scene.

487
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,500
You put the lives
of the entire away
team in jeopardy,

488
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:57,291
and you made
an already tense
situation worse.

489
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:05,709
Your actions reflect
very badly on this ship
and on that uniform.

490
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:10,458
Now, I want an
explanation, Mr. Crusher,
and I want it now.

491
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:17,125
What you're doing
down there is wrong.

492
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,834
These people are not
some random group
of colonists.

493
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,375
They're a unique culture
with a history

494
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:24,208
that predates the
Federation and Starfleet.

495
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,917
That does not alter
the fact that my
orders are to...

496
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,834
I know Admiral Necheyev
gave you an order,

497
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,625
and she was given
an order from the
Federation council,

498
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:33,041
but it's still wrong.

499
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:36,917
That decision is not
yours to make, Cadet.

500
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:40,959
I don't know what has
got into you lately,

501
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,333
and frankly, right now,
I don't care.

502
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:46,625
But I will tell you
this-- while you
wear that uniform,

503
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:49,375
you will obey every
order you are given

504
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:53,250
and you<i> will</i> conform
to Starfleet regulations
and rules of conduct.

505
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,000
Is that clear?

506
00:31:55,041 --> 00:32:01,166
Yes, sir, it is,
but I won't be wearing
this uniform any longer.

507
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,875
I'm resigning
from the academy.

508
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:07,625
(<i> badge drops</i> )

509
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:12,458
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

510
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:14,834
Riker to Captain.

511
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,333
Go ahead, Number One.

512
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,041
Gul Evek
wants to meet with you

513
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:22,291
to discuss the situation
on the surface.

514
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,000
Let him come aboard.

515
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,208
I'll see him in here.

516
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,583
Aye, sir.

517
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:36,792
Why are you doing this?

518
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:38,917
I told you.

519
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,375
Starfleet isn't for me.

520
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,500
Look, I may not
be able to stop you

521
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:49,458
from throwing away
your entire life,

522
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,000
but you<i> are</i> going to
stand here and explain
it to me first.

523
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:55,208
You owe me that much.

524
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:05,291
I saw Dad today.
He told me not
to follow him.

525
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,000
You what?

526
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:13,750
I was participating
in an Indian ritual
and I had a vision.

527
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:17,208
Dad came to me and told
me not to follow him.

528
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,500
He said I had to
find my own path.

529
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,667
Is that what
this is all about?

530
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,083
A vision told you
to leave the academy,

531
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,583
and now you're
packing your bags?

532
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:29,750
No. No, it's
more than that.

533
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:33,250
I've known
I needed to do this
for a long time.

534
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,583
I just haven't been able
to admit it to myself.

535
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,625
But you always said
that being at the academy

536
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,166
was the best thing that
ever happened to you.

537
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:41,792
I know.
For a while, it was.

538
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:44,917
But as time went on
and graduation got closer,

539
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:48,041
I... I started feeling
really depressed.

540
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,000
I thought maybe
it was the workload

541
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:53,875
or the stress
of being away from home,
but it didn't go away.

542
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:55,166
It just got worse.

543
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,583
(<i> sighing</i> )

544
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:02,792
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

545
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:06,959
I didn't want to
disappoint you or Captain
Picard or my friends.

546
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,291
You guys were
all so proud of me.

547
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:13,583
I'd be proud of you
no matter what you
were doing, Wesley.

548
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:16,500
I love<i> you.</i>

549
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:19,709
I know, Mom.

550
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:25,625
I guess the truth is
that I was afraid of
disappointing myself.

551
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:28,750
I never questioned
the fact that I would
be in Starfleet,

552
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:31,959
but when Dad said
not to follow him,

553
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,834
it just made
so much sense.

554
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,709
Everything is
so clear now.

555
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:46,458
Maybe it is partly
my fault.

556
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:52,583
We didn't realize
the kind of pressure
we were putting on you

557
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,709
to be exactly what we
expected you to be.

558
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:59,375
Oh, I don't blame
you at all.

559
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:02,875
This is my decision.
It always has been.

560
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:09,750
You know that... alien...
from Tau Ceti--

561
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:12,792
the one who could control
warp fields with his mind?

562
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:14,166
The traveler.

563
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:16,083
He told Captain Picard
a long time ago

564
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:21,000
that you were very
special, like Mozart...

565
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:24,083
and that you were
destined for something
quite different

566
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,291
from the rest of us.

567
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:29,083
Maybe this is
the first step.

568
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:33,291
I love you.

569
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:38,834
I love you, too, Mom.

570
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:41,291
You shouldn't
be here, Wesley.

571
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,166
Why?

572
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,750
Get down there!

573
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,709
Bring them over here.

574
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,208
Why have you taken
these men prisoner?

575
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,542
This is not their world.
They have no right
to be here.

576
00:35:56,583 --> 00:36:00,125
The terms of the treaty
gives them the right
to survey this planet.

577
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:02,917
We don't recognize
that treaty.

578
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:06,083
(<i> indistinct shouting</i> )

579
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,333
Worf to Picard.

580
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,583
An armed group of
Indians has taken two
Cardassian prisoners.

581
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,875
The situation
is extremely volatile.

582
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:21,208
Request instructions.

583
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,500
Stand by, Mr. Worf.

584
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,208
Have your ship
lock on to your people

585
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,125
and beam them out of there
before something happens.

586
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:31,458
<i>My</i> people? What about
these Indians of yours?

587
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,917
They've taken hostages!

588
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,583
This is our planet,
Captain.

589
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,750
We will not
be chased away
by some unruly crowd.

590
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:39,417
Gul Evek to the<i> Vetar.</i>

591
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:42,000
This is Glinn Telak
aboard the<i> Vetar.</i> 
Go ahead.

592
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,583
Two of our men on
the surface have
been taken prisoner.

593
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,333
Prepare to send an
armed squad of troopers

594
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,875
to rescue them and
to occupy the village.

595
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:52,041
Gul Evek, those people
are Federation citizens

596
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,917
and I am sworn
to protect them.

597
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:56,041
If your troops
attack that village,

598
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,375
my security forces
will respond.

599
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,041
I hope you realize
the consequences

600
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:03,166
of Federation officers
firing on Cardassian troops.

601
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,583
Oh, yes, I do.
That is why

602
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:09,792
we must stop this now
before it's too late.

603
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,834
I cannot allow you
to hold these men
as prisoners.

604
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,917
You have no
authority here.

605
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,125
(<i> grunting</i> )

606
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:24,625
No!

607
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,250
What happened?

608
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:39,625
Did you do this?

609
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,041
(<i> chuckles</i> )

610
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:44,417
I didn't do
anything; you did.

611
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,834
<i>I</i> did?

612
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:49,500
You pulled yourself
out of their time.

613
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:51,583
You took the
first step, Wesley.

614
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:53,417
My first step to where?

615
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:56,208
To another plane
of existence...

616
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,000
another way of thinking.

617
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,208
I don't understand.

618
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,959
You found a new
beginning for yourself--

619
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,583
the first step
on a journey

620
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:06,417
that few humans
will ever take.

621
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:09,000
Who are you?

622
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,500
The traveler.

623
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:19,000
I've waited a long time
for this moment, Wesley.

624
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:24,291
So, all those things
I saw in the habak--

625
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:28,083
my father and the things
he said to me--

626
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:29,667
that was<i> your</i> doing?

627
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:32,250
I merely opened
the door for you.

628
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:35,041
What you experienced
came from your own mind--

629
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:38,375
your own...
spirit, if you wish.

630
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,291
I hoped that you
would open your mind

631
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,291
to new possibilities,
and you did.

632
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:45,208
You pulled yourself out
of time, don't you see?

633
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,041
You've evolved
to a new level.

634
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,417
You're ready to
explore places

635
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:50,792
where thought
and energy combine

636
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:53,917
in ways you can't
even imagine.

637
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:57,041
And I will
be your guide...

638
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,333
if you like.

639
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,875
What about them?

640
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:07,291
I can't just leave
them like this.

641
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:09,917
They must find their
own destinies, Wesley.

642
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:12,625
It's not our place
to... interfere.

643
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,917
But--
Have faith
in their abilities

644
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:17,500
to solve their
problems on their own.

645
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,667
(<i> yelling</i> )

646
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:27,834
The Cardassian ship
is powering its weapons
and its transporters.

647
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,834
This is the<i> Vetar</i> to Gul Evek.
Our troops are under attack.

648
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,458
They're requesting
immediate assistance.

649
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,667
What are your orders?

650
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:39,417
Evek, the last war
caused massive destruction
and cost millions of lives.

651
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:43,041
Don't send our two
peoples down that same
path again-- not like this.

652
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,959
Now the future lies
in your hands, right now.

653
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,291
Give us one last chance
for peace.

654
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:49,917
Gul Evek,
what are your orders?

655
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:53,125
Can we open fire?

656
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:55,667
Evek to the<i> Vetar.</i>

657
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:59,250
Lock on our troops
on the surface...

658
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,125
and beam them aboard.

659
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,709
But, sir,
they've been fired upon!

660
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,083
Those are my orders!
Carry them out.

661
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,291
Yes, sir.

662
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,750
Beam up the away
team immediately.

663
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:08,917
Aye, sir.

664
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:14,709
I lost two of three sons
in the war, Captain.

665
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,875
I don't want to lose
the last one.

666
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,959
Anthwara, I want to
be absolutely sure

667
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,500
that you understand
the implications
of this agreement.

668
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:41,041
By giving up your status
as Federation citizens,

669
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:43,834
any future request
you or your people

670
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:48,041
make to Starfleet
will go unanswered.

671
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:51,291
You will be
on your own...

672
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:54,125
and under Cardassian
jurisdiction.

673
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:56,375
I understand, Captain,

674
00:40:56,417 --> 00:41:00,959
and we are prepared
to take that risk.

675
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:07,583
Will the Cardassian
government honor
your agreement here?

676
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,208
I believe
I can convince them

677
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,834
that this is
an equitable solution.

678
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:14,875
I cannot speak for
every Cardassian
you may encounter,

679
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:21,458
but if you leave us
alone, I suspect that
we will do the same.

680
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,375
Will this be acceptable
to the Starfleet command?

681
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:27,667
It will not be easy,
but with Admiral
Necheyev's support,

682
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:31,041
I think they will go
along with it in the end.

683
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:34,291
Then, if there's
nothing else, I will
return to my ship.

684
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,583
I have a rather lengthy
report to write.

685
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:39,709
Captain. Anthwara.

686
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,583
I was right, Captain.

687
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:49,291
You did not take us
from our land,

688
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:55,333
and you have wiped
clean a very old
stain of blood.

689
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,583
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

690
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:11,458
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47755.3.</i>

691
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,750
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is</i>
<i>preparing to leave Dorvan V,</i>

692
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:19,625
<i>but former Cadet Wesley Crusher</i>
<i>will be staying behind.</i>

693
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,959
Where will you go?

694
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,583
The traveler said
that my studies would
begin with these people.

695
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:31,792
He said that they're
aware of many things.

696
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:35,500
I can learn
a lot from them.

697
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:37,959
That's just what I need--
more studying.

698
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,208
Somehow,
I think you'll manage.

699
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,583
Me, too.

700
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:47,333
Well, good luck,
Mr...

701
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,959
Good luck, Wesley.

702
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,875
Thank you...
for a lot of things.

703
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,166
Oh...

704
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:06,917
Now, you be sure
and dress warmly

705
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,917
on those other planes
of existence.

706
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:12,041
I will.

707
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,625
Bye, Mom.

708
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,291
Good-bye.

709
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:28,834
PICARD:
Energize.
