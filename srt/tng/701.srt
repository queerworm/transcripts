It was just after I
had killed the Borg.

6
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:14,667
I felt something.

7
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:16,417
I believe... it was...

8
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:19,792
pleasure.

9
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:20,834

they were part of

11
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,792
One of them referred
to himself as "I."

12
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:26,333
The only Borg who had
a name was Hugh.

13
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,166
We are Hugh.

PICARD:
He was here in this room.

15
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,667
I could have rid the Federation
of a mortal threat

16
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:33,250
and I let him go.

17
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,583
The Borg have established
several transwarp conduits

18
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,291

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,959

22
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,750

What do you think of
my followers, Picard?

39
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,250
Impressive, aren't they?

40
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:47,041
I'm not particularly impressed.

41
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,250
All you've done is teach them
to enjoy killing.

DATA:
You are wrong,
Captain.

43
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:54,959
My brother and I serve
a much higher purpose.

44
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,500
Data, I can sense
feelings in you.

45
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:02,458
Yes. My brother
has made that possible.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,041
He gave you the chip--

47
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,959
the one Dr. Soong
made for you.

I still have
the emotional program

51
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,917
my father designed.

52
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,875
I wouldn't want to give it up.

53
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:21,166
It's what has given me such
a strong sense of family--

54
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,834
an intense desire to reunite

55
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,667
with my dear brother.

56
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,875
How did he do it, Data?

57
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:28,583
What made you decide
to come here?

58
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,208

I will tell you

60
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,625
You're controlling him

61
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:35,834

the Borg.

how I found my true calling

66
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,667
how the Borg found something
to believe in.

67
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,000
I would like
to learn about that

68
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,583
but I want Data to tell us.

69
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,542
I told you,

70
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,875
I will tell you
what you need to know.

71
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,417
How about that, Data?

72
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,875
He won't even
let you talk.

73
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,792
Do not try to drive
a wedge between us, Captain.

74
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,709
I am loyal to my brother.

You see, Picard?

76
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,083
He's not your pawn anymore.

77
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,875
I've helped him to break free

78
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:19,458
just as I've helped them.

79
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,125
Look at them.

80
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,166
Look at what
I've helped them become.

81
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,875
They're no longer simply
mindless automatons.

82
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,500
They're passionate.

83
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:31,750
Alive.

84
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,333
Are you saying
that<i> you</i>

85
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,041
caused them
to become individuals?

86
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,834
No. You did that--
you and your friends.

87
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,000
All I did was clean up
the mess you made

88
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,000
when that Borg you befriended
returned to his ship.

89
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,959
Hugh interfaced with the others
and transferred

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
his sense
of individuality to them.

91
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,875
It nearly destroyed them.

92
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:53,417
Data, do you remember
when Hugh was on board
the<i> Enterprise?</i>

93
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,542
Do you remember what
you were like then?

94
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,208
That doesn't matter.

95
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,834
It matters to me.

96
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,166
I want to know
what has happened to Data.

97
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,625
What's important
is what I've done here--

98
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:06,083
how I found my calling.

99
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,709
I know now why I was created.

100
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,333
No one can ever take that
away from me.

101
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,208
Without me,
they would have perished.

102
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,542
When I stumbled
on their ship,

103
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,709
they were lost,
disoriented.

104
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,166
They had no idea
how to function as individuals.

105
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,500
They couldn't even navigate
their own vessel.

106
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:30,208
They had lost
their sense of purpose.

107
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,458
Well, I gave them their purpose

108
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,125
and they gave me mine.

109
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,375

the captain's team.

183
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,625
I'm not going
to leave you down there.

184
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,709
You pull as many people
off the surface as you can

185
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,333
and get back to
the transwarp conduit.

186
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,750
The captain's orders were
to get the<i> Enterprise</i>

187
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,000
back to Federation space.

188
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,750
Acknowledged.

189
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:53,792
Riker out.

190
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,250
Prepare to leave orbit.

191
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,208
Sir, the Borg ship
is powering up

192
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,667
its forward weapons array.

193
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:01,834
They'll be in firing range
in... in 20 seconds.

194
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,458
Salazar, how many people
do we still have down there?

195
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,583
73, sir.

196
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,250
Put the Borg ship on screen.

197
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,625
Should I raise
shields, sir?

198
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:11,750
Not yet.

199
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,083
I want to keep
bringing people up

200
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,041
until the last possible second.

201
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,875
TAITT:
Ten seconds.

202
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,834
Stand by to raise shields
and break orbit on my mark.

203
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:21,959
Five seconds.

204
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,458
Mark.

205
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,709
Shields down to 70%.

206
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,750
Establish a frequency shift
firing pattern

207
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,166
and return fire.

208
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,750
Uh... right.

209
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,417
Direct hit.
No damage.

210
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,500
Helm, set a course
for the conduit, maximum warp.

211
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,083
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

212
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:56,125
Sir, the Borg
aren't following us.

213
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,291
Salazar,

214
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,583
how many people
did we leave behind?

215
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,417
47, sir.

216
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,750
Another minute
and we would have had them.

217
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:09,834
Riker to any team leader.

218
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,959
Lieutenant Powell here, sir.

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,125
Round up everybody
who was left behind

220
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,417
take cover and try to avoid
any contact with the Borg.

221
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,583
Aye, sir.

222
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,500
Riker out.

223
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:25,333
Even if Beverly can get
back to Federation space

224
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,875
it will be a few days
until Starfleet

225
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,208
can get
any ships here.

226
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,125
Until then,
we're on our own.

227
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,041
Data, you must realize that
something has happened to you.

228
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,208
The Data I know
would never have agreed

229
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,208
to be a willing party
to Lore's plan.

230
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,583
I now realize
that my life

231
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,667
aboard the<i> Enterprise</i>
was a waste.

232
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,375
My quest to become human

233
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:57,667
misguided--

234
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:58,959
an evolutionary step

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,125
in the wrong
direction.

236
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,542
Data, all I'm sensing from you
is anger and hatred.

237
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,959
Have you felt
any other emotions?

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,709
There are no other emotions.

239
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,583
Data, just because you haven't
experienced certain emotions

240
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,208
doesn't mean they don't exist.

241
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,458
Lore is only feeding you
the negative ones.

242
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,000
Counselor Troi herself told me

243
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,458
that feelings are not
negative or positive.

244
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,667
It is how we act on them
that makes them good or bad.

245
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,375
Fine

246
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,417
but what about the things
that Lore is proposing?

247
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,667
What about the lives
that have already been lost?

248
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,458
You simply do not understand.

249
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,417
In a quest such as ours,
sacrifices have to be made.

250
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,583
It is regrettable

251
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,583
but the greater good
must be served.

252
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,083
Give me your VISOR.

253
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,291
Why?

254
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,959
Give it to me

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,333
or I will take
it by force.

256
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,166
(<i> sighing</i> )

257
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,834
I am not your puppet anymore.

258
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,166
Sir, we've reached
the coordinates

259
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,750
of the conduit.

260
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:35,125
The tachyon matrix
is energized and ready to go

261
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,250
and Lieutenant Barnaby
has returned from the surface.

262
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,542
He'll be relieving me.

263
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,834
Right. Stand by
to trigger the conduit.

264
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,291
Taitt, I want you
to stay on the bridge.

265
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,959
I'll need a science officer
at the aft station.

266
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,333
Yes, sir.

267
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,667
Helm, set a course to return
to the planet.

268
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,208
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

269
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,375
I'm not leaving those people
stranded back there.

270
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,959
An emergency buoy can transmit
a copy of our log entries

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,125
to Starfleet
just as easily as we can.

272
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,583
Ensign, prepare a buoy
and launch it when ready.

273
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,917
Aye, sir.

274
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,083
CRUSHER:
Lieutenant,
open the conduit.

275
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,542
TAITT:
Launching buoy now, sir.

276
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,875
Lieutenant,
scan for any Borg ships

277
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,709
between here and the planet.

278
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,417
Sensors detect
no vessels.

279
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,291
We have to assume
the ship that attacked us

280
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,375
is still in orbit.

281
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:23,709
How long will we have

282
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,583
before they can detect us
and intercept?

283
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,834
If their sensors function
as well as ours

284
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,542
it could be as little
as 30 seconds.

285
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,208
Crusher to Salazar.

286
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,083
How long will it take
to get the rest of the crew

287
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,041
off the surface?

288
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,000
One minute should do it.

289
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,083
We don't have one minute.

290
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,583
How much can you
shave off that?

291
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,875
If I could get
a good lock on them quickly

292
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:43,208
I might be able to do it
in 45 or 50 seconds.

293
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,125
We need to buy ourselves
15 seconds.

294
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,542
Lieutenant,
is there any way

295
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,333
we can use the planet
as a barrier

296
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,583
to keep the Borg from realizing
we're in orbit?

297
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,041
We can enter orbit

298
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,000
while they're on the far side
of the planet.

299
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,834
And if we delay
dropping out of warp

300
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,166
until the last possible instant

301
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,834
we could gain
a few more seconds.

302
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,333
TAITT:
If your calculations
are even slightly off,

303
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,959
we'd hit the atmosphere.

304
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,792
I'll just have to be sure
my calculations are accurate,

305
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:11,166
Ensign.

306
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,291
Let's do it.

307
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,500
Helm, hard about.

308
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:20,875
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

309
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,625
Still no sign
of the structure.

310
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,166
With all this interference
it could be 100 meters away

311
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,417
and we wouldn't know it.

312
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,208
This could take hours.

313
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,250
I'm picking up
a faint energy reading.

314
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,375
Residual
thermal traces.

315
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,125
Somebody stood here.

316
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,667
The decay rate indicates
it could be human.

317
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,500
They took this path.

318
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,333
There you are, brother.

319
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,083
Here is the VISOR.

320
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,542
May I ask why you wanted it.

321
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,166
Thought it might
look good on me.

322
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,542
What do you think?

323
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,583
Maybe we should work on
your sense of humor, brother.

324
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,709
Actually, I was thinking
La Forge's implants

325
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,083
might make him an
ideal test subject

326
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,709
for my experiment.

327
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,166
All of the Borg you have
experimented on so far

328
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,041
have suffered
extensive brain damage.

329
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,083
Using the humans
to perfect the procedure

330
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,834
will allow us to prevent
any further Borg deaths.

331
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,917
I understand.

332
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,583
Good.

333
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,125
What is it?

334
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,750
This Borg
has disconnected himself

335
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,667
from the others.

336
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,291
He would not let me
hear his thoughts.

337
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

338
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,041
I've asked you
to stay linked

339
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,000
to Crosis at all times.

340
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,667
You know that,
don't you?

341
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:55,792
Yes.

342
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,333
I know this must be
difficult for you.

343
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,834
I know how uncertain
you must feel.

344
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,875
All of these
sensations are new

345
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:08,250
and they can be
frightening.

346
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,917
Isn't that right?

347
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,125
Yes.

348
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,375
I have doubts.

349
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,250
Of course, you do.

350
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,375
It's only natural.

351
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:21,333
No one is going
to blame you for that.

352
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,917
But in order
to lose those doubts

353
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,792
to keep fear

354
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:28,500
and confusion away

355
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:32,458
I need you to remain
linked to the others

356
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,000
so that their strength

357
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,750
and their confidence
can help you.

358
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:39,333
I need you, Goval.

359
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,583
I need you to help me
build a future

360
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,875
for the Borg.

361
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,542
I can't do it
without you.

362
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,041
Will you help me?

363
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,625
Yes, I will.

364
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,250
Lore must have told Data
to take my VISOR

365
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,834
because he realized
I could see

366
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,083
a carrier wave that was
radiating from him.

367
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,959
A carrier wave?

368
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,834
Is that how he's
manipulating Data?

369
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,041
I think what's happening

370
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,792
is that Lore is tapping
into the chip

371
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,125
he stole from Dr. Soong

372
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,875
and somehow he's
found a way to transmit

373
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,750
part of that emotional
program to Data.

374
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,542
But the only emotions
Data seems to feel
are negative.

375
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,458
Yeah, I'm sure
that's intentional.

376
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,291
But in order for Data
to be affected by those emotions

377
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,625
Lore would have had
to disable

378
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,834
his ethical program first.

379
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,667
Can we reactivate it?

380
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:33,250
If I can generate
a phased Kedion pulse

381
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,083
at the right frequency,
that would trigger

382
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,291
Data's subsystems,
and reboot the program.

383
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,667
And although Lore

384
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:41,250
would still be feeding him

385
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,250
negative emotions at least
Data might listen to us.

386
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,667
Right.

387
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:47,291
I think it's
worth a try.

388
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,083
So, got any ideas

389
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,583
on how we generate
a Kedion pulse?

390
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,750
(<i> force-field deactivates</i> )

391
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Data, where are
you taking him?

392
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,917
That is not
your concern.

393
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:03,166
Data, wait.
Let us talk to you.

394
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,458
(<i> distant voices</i> )

395
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,458
(<i> mechanical whirring</i> )

396
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,041
Commander.

397
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:37,166
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

398
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:05,625
Hugh?

399
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,417
Why are you here
Commander Riker?

400
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,875
Hasn't the crew
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

401
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,667
caused enough damage already?

402
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,417
So, you blame us

403
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,875
for what has happened
to the Borg?

404
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,500
You gave me a sense
of individuality

405
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:25,041
changed me, then sent me
back to the collective.

406
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,291
You must have known
that change would be
passed on to others.

407
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,041
We considered it.

408
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,542
We knew it was a possibility.

409
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,208
Then you made it possible
for Lore to dominate us.

410
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,083
I cannot accept that.

411
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,917
Lore is only one.

412
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,291
The Borg could
have stopped him.

413
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,000
You don't know
the condition we were in

414
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,834
when he found us.

415
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,667
Before my experience
on the<i> Enterprise</i>

416
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:48,041
the Borg were
a single-minded collective.

417
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,000
The voices in our heads
were smooth and flowing

418
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,667
but after I returned

419
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:54,625
those voices began to change.

420
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,542
They became uneven, discordant.

421
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:00,208
For the first time

422
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,458
individual Borg
had differing ideas

423
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,750
about how to proceed.

424
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,750
We couldn't function.

425
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,792
Some Borg fought each other.

426
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,333
Others simply
shut themselves down.

427
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,750
Many starved to death.

428
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,083
And then, Lore came along.

429
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,417
You probably
can't imagine

430
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,709
what it is like to be
so lost and frightened

431
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,750
that you will listen
to any voice

432
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,166
which promises change.

433
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,000
Even if that voice
insists on controlling you?

434
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,250
That's what
we wanted--

435
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,625
someone to show us
a way out of confusion.

436
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:30,458
Lore promised clarity
and purpose.

437
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,542
At the beginning,
he seemed like a savior.

438
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,000
The promise of becoming
a superior race--

439
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,667
of becoming
fully artificial--

440
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:39,125
was compelling.

441
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,834
We gladly did everything
he asked of us

442
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,041
but, after a while,
it became clear

443
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,959
that Lore had no idea
how to keep his promise.

444
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,291
That's when he began talking

445
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,333
about the need for us
to make sacrifices.

446
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,166
Before we realized it,

447
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,125
this was the result.

448
00:20:56,709 --> 00:20:58,083
RIKER:
What happened to them?

449
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,542
Lore began to experiment

450
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,166
trying to remake us
in his image.

451
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,458
This is the result
of my encounter

452
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,375
with the<i> Enterprise,</i>
Commander.

453
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:07,375
So you can see

454
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:08,583
I don't particularly

455
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,917
welcome your presence here.

456
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,834
I'm sorry you feel that way.

457
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,792
We just came
to get our people.

458
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:17,041
We won't cause you
any more trouble.

459
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:19,875
Tell me about my friend.

460
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,792
Friend?

461
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,291
The human called Geordi.

462
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,250
I wish I could tell you
about him.

463
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,458
We think he may be held
inside the compound.

464
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,750
I cannot help you.

465
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:44,333
I cannot risk
our being discovered.

466
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,583
Could you at least show us
a way into the compound?

467
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,417
These caverns lead to tunnels
which run beneath the compound.

468
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,583
Some of them connect

469
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,291
with the environmental
control ducts.

470
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,834
Show us.

471
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,333
If we could determine
the geography of the compound

472
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,917
we could form a rescue plan.

473
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,917
(<i> beeping</i> )

474
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,291
Data?

475
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,792
Who's there?

476
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:17,959
(<i> Picard's voice</i> ):
Geordi.

477
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,625
Captain...

478
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:23,625
(<i> Picard's voice</i> ):
Shh. We're getting
out of here.

479
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:24,792
Come on, hurry.

480
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,000
Data was just here.

481
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,333
I think he went
to get something.

482
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,417
(<i> normal voice</i> ):
Too late.

483
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,500
My brother suggested

484
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,709
I try to develop
my sense of humor.

485
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,208
What do you think?

486
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,125
I think it needs
a little work.

487
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:44,709
(<i> whirring</i> )

488
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,792
What's happening?

489
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:47,834
I'm attempting
to neutralize

490
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,500
your pain receptors.

491
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,542
What are you going
to do to me?

492
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,208
I'm implanting
nano-cortical fibers

493
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,834
in your cerebrum.

494
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,041
They are designed
to learn

495
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,375
and mimic your
neural firing patterns.

496
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:03,834
Once they are in place

497
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,166
I will destroy
the existing brain cells.

498
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,208
Then we will see if the
artificial neural network

499
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,250
is able to take over
your cognitive functions.

500
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,875
Data, listen.

501
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:15,792
Lore is controlling you.

502
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:18,083
He's transmitting a carrier
wave, which is affecting

503
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,875
your positronic matrix.

504
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,250
If the procedure is successful

505
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,208
your cognitive
processing functions

506
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,041
will be
considerably improved.

507
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,625
Don't you care
that he's manipulating you?

508
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:32,500
However, there is a 60% chance

509
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,458
you will not survive
the procedure.

510
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,375
I don't care much
for those odds.

511
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:38,375
Hmm...

512
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,083
They are cause for concern.

513
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,750
However, I still have
Counselor Troi

514
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:44,417
and Captain Picard.

515
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,792
Odds are at least one
of the procedures

516
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:47,208
will be successful.

517
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,792
TROI:
Help me!

518
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,417
He tried to escape.

519
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,125
The force-field sent
him into neural shock.

520
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:07,875
If he dies,
Lore will blame you.

521
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,750
(<i> groaning</i> )

522
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,250
See if the corridor
is empty.

523
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,583
(<i> gasping</i> )

524
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:34,709
Drop it,
or I'll break his neck.

525
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:47,917
Take him.

526
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,709
What have you done to him?

527
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,041
I will be back
for him later.

528
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,792
Geordi, are
you in pain?

529
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:07,250
No, I'm just a little dizzy.

530
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:12,709
I was able to take
part of a transceiver

531
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,250
from the guard's
interlink system.

532
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:16,542
I think that it uses

533
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:20,000
some kind of phased
pulse technology.

534
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,959
Do you think
it could be modified

535
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,542
to generate a Kedion pulse

536
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,542
that would reboot
Data's program?

537
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,041
Yeah.
Yeah, it's possible.

538
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,792
See if you can locate
the phase modulation circuitry.

539
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:35,291
I'll watch the door.

540
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,542
(<i> clicking )</i>

541
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,000
(<i> beeping</i> )

542
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:47,500
All right.

543
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:49,083
I think that I've found it.

544
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,583
Okay, good.

545
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:53,500
Now, do you see anything
that we might be able to use

546
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:55,792
as a flux inhibitor?

547
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,166
Hmm...

548
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:03,417
Sensors still can't
locate the Borg ship.

549
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,041
I'm trying to filter out
the interference.

550
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,458
We'll be within
transporter range

551
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,291
in 19 seconds.

552
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,125
I'm starting to get
sensor resolution.

553
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,417
CRUSHER:
There's the ship.

554
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,500
We'll enter orbit here.

555
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:18,000
Helm, new course--
heading 052 mark 7.

556
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,083
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

557
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:20,083
Stand by to drop
out of warp

558
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,500
in eight seconds.

559
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,000
TAITT:
Once we're in orbit
we should have

560
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,125
about 45 seconds
before they intercept us.

561
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,041
Let's hope it's enough time.

562
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,166
BARNABY:
Emergency deceleration
in five seconds.

563
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,250
Hold on.

564
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,625
Report.

565
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:34,875
We're in standard orbit, sir.

566
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:36,709
The Borg ship is
on the planet's far side

567
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,458
and is moving
to intercept.

568
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,250
Bridge to transporter rooms,
begin evacuations.

569
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,083
The Borg will be
in weapons range
in 32 seconds.

570
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,083
We still can't locate
Captain Picard's team

571
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:50,166
and there's no sign
of Commander Riker
or Lieutenant Worf.

572
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,959
Crusher to Salazar.
Report.

573
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,625
We're pulling
the last teams off right now

574
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,333
but there are six people
still unaccounted for.

575
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,750
CRUSHER:
Keep trying.

576
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,083
BARNABY:
Borg ship is powering up
its weapons array.

577
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,291
Come on, Chief,
it's now or never.

578
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,875
TAITT:
They're preparing to fire.

579
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:07,750
Raise shields.

580
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,041
(<i> explosion</i> )

581
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,792
BARNABY:
The port nacelle
has been hit.

582
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:12,792
Helm, get us out of here.

583
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:13,834
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

584
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,500
We've lost warp engines.

585
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:17,500
Evasive maneuvers, full impulse.

586
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,208
TAITT:
Shields down to 80%.

587
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,250
Fire phasers.

588
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:28,208
Direct hit.

589
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,625
No damage to the Borg ship.

590
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,083
Shields down to 73%.

591
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,083
What's the status
of the warp engines?

592
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,166
Still down.
We can't outrun them.

593
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,208
Helm, set a new course--

594
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,041
heading 344 mark 6.

595
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,041
Full impulse.
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

596
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:47,250
Sir, that heading takes us
directly into the sun.

597
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,709
The data banks should
contain information

598
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,917
on a process called
metaphasic shielding.

599
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,375
I know about
that research.

600
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:03,834
Commander La Forge was
developing a program

601
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,542
that would implement
metaphasic properties.

602
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,208
Right, how far
along was he?

603
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,333
Well, it's in the data banks
but it's never been tested.

604
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,250
If we had
metaphasic shielding,

605
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:12,875
we could enter
the sun's corona

606
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:15,250
but the Borg ship
wouldn't be able to follow.

607
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,417
Can you bring
the program on line?

608
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,709
I can, but we have
no way of knowing

609
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,083
if the shields
will hold.

610
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,208
Sir, hull temperature

611
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,875
is rising-- now at
12,000 degrees C.

612
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:27,333
Radiation level
nearing 10,000 rads.

613
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:28,542
Report.

614
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,500
Shields at 62%.

615
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,709
Lieutenant, activate
the metaphasic program.

616
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:37,041
It's our best shot.

617
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,041
Aye, sir.

618
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,375
Hull temperature
is critical.

619
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,166
We can't withstand
this heat much longer.

620
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,750
Program is on line.

621
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:46,166
Engaging metaphasic shield<i> now.</i>

622
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:55,750
Hull temperature dropping.

623
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:59,792
Down to 7,000 degrees.

624
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,458
Maintain course.

625
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,458
Borg ship has
broken off pursuit.

626
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,166
All stop.

627
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,291
Sir, the Borg ship is taking
up position relative to ours.

628
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,041
They're going to wait
for us to come out.

629
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:21,917
The question is,
how long can we survive in here?

630
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:35,709
Well...

631
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,208
I've done everything
that Geordi told me.

632
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,041
Now to activate it.

633
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,500
How are we going
to know whether the pulse

634
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:43,375
reboots Data's
ethical program?

635
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:45,834
We'll only tell that
when we see his behavior.

636
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,792
Won't he realize
something's happened to him?

637
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:51,333
No, that's one program
among thousands.

638
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:54,417
I just hope that
this force-field

639
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:57,583
has enough energy...

640
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:58,959
to trigger the pulse.

641
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,542
You know, Data

642
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:07,542
I've been thinking about
some of the times we've had.

643
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,709
Like that time we went
sailing on Devala lake.

644
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,125
You remember that?

645
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,250
I have a complete
memory record of that day.

646
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:18,792
(<i> chuckling</i> )

647
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:22,583
You decided to go swimming
and when you jumped

648
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,333
out of the boat you sank
straight to the bottom.

649
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:28,250
I did not have enough buoyancy
to get back to the surface.

650
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,625
You had to walk over a kilometer
along the bottom

651
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:31,792
to get back to shore.

652
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:34,583
One kilometer, 46 meters.

653
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,959
It took almost two weeks to get
the water out of your servos.

654
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:41,250
I am ready to irradiate
your existing brain cells.

655
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:46,792
Data...

656
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:49,709
if you ever go back
to the way you were

657
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,083
you might not be able
to forgive yourself

658
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,709
for what you're
about to do.

659
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,000
I am getting
some anomalous readings

660
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:01,333
from your neural net.

661
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:04,959
I will need to do further
testing before... I proceed.

662
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,750
Someone will come and take you
back to your cell.

663
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,250
There you are, brother.

664
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,959
Have you made any
progress with La Forge?

665
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,166
It is too early to tell
if the nano-cortical fibers

666
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:30,166
performed their function.

667
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,291
I suspect none of the humans
will survive the process

668
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:36,166
but then... it's their
own fault, isn't it?

669
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:39,375
They never should
have come here.

670
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:41,000
What were they thinking?

671
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,250
They came looking for me.

672
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:46,500
Oh, humans are
so sentimental.

673
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:49,542
I betrayed them.

674
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:52,500
If they die,
I am responsible.

675
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,333
Why are you talking like that?

676
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,458
Is something wrong
with your programming?

677
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,000
Maybe I should
check your systems.

678
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,041
I do not want you
to check my systems.

679
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,291
I must resolve
these issues myself.

680
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,709
I think I made a mistake.

681
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,125
I don't believe
you can tolerate

682
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,792
the amount of emotion
I've given you.

683
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:16,166
Perhaps I should cut back
a little.

684
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,625
(<i> gasps</i> )

685
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:19,000
How's that?

686
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:21,917
I do not like it.

687
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:23,917
Then you prefer
to have more emotions?

688
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:25,291
Yes.

689
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:28,333
They give you pleasure?

690
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,875
Yes, please, I want more.

691
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,500
All right.

692
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:34,542
A<i> little</i> more...

693
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,083
for now.

694
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:44,250
Aren't you going
to thank me?

695
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:45,208
Thank you.

696
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,917
Don't mention it.

697
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:49,875
I just hope this helps
to clarify things for you.

698
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:04,458
I'm concerned about
my brother, Crosis.

699
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:08,667
I don't believe
he really wants

700
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,667
to be a part
of our great future.

701
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,458
Sir, metaphasic shielding
is losing integrity.

702
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,250
Can you stabilize it?

703
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:27,917
No. We won't be able
to stay in here

704
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,709
longer than another
three or four minutes.

705
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,375
Do we have
warp engines yet?

706
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:33,834
Last estimate was
another half hour.

707
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:36,166
Sir, I think
I have an idea.

708
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:39,041
I think it's possible we could
induce a solar fusion eruption

709
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,709
that would destroy
the Borg ship.

710
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,250
What?

711
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,291
We'd need to direct
a highly energetic particle beam

712
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:45,709
onto the sun's surface.

713
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,375
That should produce
a superfluid gas eruption.

714
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,458
If we target
the right spot

715
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,000
the eruption would
envelop the Borg ship.

716
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,500
How do you know
this will work?

717
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:56,834
I did my senior honors thesis
on solar dynamics.

718
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,417
Excuse me, sir but
this isn't the academy

719
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:02,125
and a student thesis is
a long way from a workable plan.

720
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,250
I've already configured
the tractor emitters

721
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:05,667
to create the particle beam

722
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,959
and I've located
the target point on the surface.

723
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,500
If her calculations are off

724
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:11,250
that eruption
could encompass us.

725
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:12,834
Well, I'll just have
to make sure

726
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,333
my calculations
are accurate, Lieutenant.

727
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,333
Let's do it.

728
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,291
Yes, sir.

729
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,333
The target area
of the photosphere

730
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,709
is destabilizing.

731
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,000
Pressure wave expansion
is accelerating.

732
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:36,083
Subsurface fusion
has been initiated.

733
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,917
An eruption is forming
on the surface.

734
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:48,166
She did it.

735
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:50,333
The Borg ship
has been destroyed, sir.

736
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,959
CRUSHER:
Helm, take us back
to the planet

737
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,291
full impulse.

738
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:54,250
Aye, sir.

739
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:55,792
Well done, Taitt.

740
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:13,583
You're killing him.

741
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,417
He won't survive
another session.

742
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,375
I did not come for him.

743
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,333
I came for you.

744
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,709
(<i> groaning softly</i> )

745
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,959
Data, it's not too late.

746
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,500
If you remove the fibers,
then Geordi might yet recover.

747
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:41,291
That would not
be possible.

748
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:44,709
Why? Because Lore
tells you so?

749
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,875
It is for
the greater good.

750
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,458
Good?

751
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,750
Data, isn't good and bad,

752
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:55,583
right and wrong

753
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:59,000
a function of your
ethical program?

754
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,208
That is correct.

755
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,709
And what does
that program tell you

756
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,667
about what you're doing
to Geordi?

757
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:06,125
About what you and Lore
are doing to the Borg?

758
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,083
It tells you that
these things are wrong

759
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,792
doesn't it, Data?

760
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,208
So how can actions
that are wrong

761
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,959
lead to a greater good?

762
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:18,709
You are attempting
to confuse me.

763
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,792
No, you're not confused, Data.

764
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,458
You're sensing the truth.

765
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:26,208
Your ethical program
is fighting the
negative emotions

766
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,709
that Lore
is sending you.

767
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:32,250
Ah, Captain.

768
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,625
Thank you so much
for joining us.

769
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,166
You are going to
assist me...

770
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:43,792
in a most important ceremony.

771
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,083
We can use the
environmental
control ducts

772
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,542
to get into
the compound.

773
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,709
They should lead us
to the detention area.

774
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,083
We'll have
to move fast.

775
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,667
If we need to stun
one of the guards

776
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:54,458
the Borg will know right away
if he's been hurt.

777
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,750
When they realize

778
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:57,917
your escape route
may be compromised.

779
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,291
I guess we'll have
to take that chance.

780
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,125
Good luck,
Commander.

781
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:18,333
It's time to put aside
all doubts, brother.

782
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,709
It's time to close
the door on the past

783
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,417
and commit yourself
to the great work

784
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,834
that lies ahead of us.

785
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,458
I need to know
I can count on you.

786
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,083
As proof,
I want you to kill Picard.

787
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,458
No... that would
be wrong.

788
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,250
I didn't think you'd
be able to do it.

789
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:03,208
You've spent
too many years
among humans.

790
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,583
Hold him.

791
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:10,291
I've asked
many sacrifices of you--

792
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,625
sacrifices I knew
were necessary

793
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:17,291
in order to build
a better future.

794
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:20,166
I want you to know
that I ask no more of you

795
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:23,333
than I am prepared
to give myself.

796
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:28,542
I am willing to make the
greatest sacrifice of all...

797
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:34,750
... my own... dear brother.

798
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:42,375
Good-bye, Data.

799
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,333
No!

800
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,834

801

Lore.

805
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:32,500
You should be careful
with that, brother.

806
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,333
Someone could get hurt.

807
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,709
What are you doing?

808
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,792
I've got a way
out of here.

809
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,959
I'm willing to forget
what happened back there--

810
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,291
take you with me.

811
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:49,125
We don't need anyone else.

812
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,458
We're brothers.

813
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,250
I'll give you the chip
our father made.

814
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,709
It contains much more
than just emotions.

815
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,709
It has memories.

816
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,750
Memories... our father

817
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:09,083
wanted you to have.

(<i> groans</i> )

819

deactivate you now.

820
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:40,166
(<i> speaking haltingly</i> ):
Without me

821
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,750
you will never
feel emotion again.

822
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:48,625
I know...

823
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:51,208
but you leave me
no other choice.

827
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,000
Good-bye, Lore.

828
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:17,750
What about Geordi and Troi?

829
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:19,250
The<i> Enterprise</i>
is in orbit.

830
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,709
I had them
beamed aboard.

831
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:24,500
Lore is no longer
functioning, sir.

832
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:25,667
He must be disassembled

833
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:27,792
so that he is
no longer a threat.

834
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,500
Welcome back, Data.

835
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:30,875
Thank you, sir.

836
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:34,542
What made you change
your mind, Hugh?

837
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,291
Perhaps my encounter
with the<i> Enterprise</i>

838
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,125
affected me more
than I realized.

839
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,500

I don't know.

842
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,709
We can't go back
to the Borg collective

843
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,417
and we no longer
have a leader here.

844
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,333
I'm not sure that's true.

845
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,000
Perhaps in time,

846
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:03,041
we will learn
to function as individuals

I wanted to let you know

I'll be able to return

859

I am... relieved
that the injuries

860

I inflicted on you
are not permanent.

00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,583
What's that?

862
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:02,000
This is the chip
my father created for me

863
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:03,792
so that I could
experience emotion.

864
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,333
I had it removed
from Lore's body

865
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,041
before he was
dismantled.

866
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:09,000
Does it work?

867
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,792
No.

868
00:43:10,834 --> 00:43:12,291

it was damaged

00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:18,667
Data, you've wanted emotions
your whole life.

872
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:22,542
Yes.

873
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:24,959
But emotions are responsible
for what I did to you.

874
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,333
I would never risk

875
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:28,291
letting that
happen again.

876
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:31,709
My friendship with you
is too important to me.

877
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:39,375
Data, I wouldn't be
very much of a friend

00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,375
if I let you give up
