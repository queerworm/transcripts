1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,333
I don't want any
trouble here, Barclay.

2
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:14,083
Trouble?
Why would there be trouble?

3
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:18,500
Because wherever you
go, trouble follows.

4
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:21,834
Lieutenant Barclay,
you're on duty.

5
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:22,917
Is that a fact?

6
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:25,000
It is,<i> and</i> you'll observe it.

7
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,000
So get back
to your post.

8
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:30,583
Look, pal,
why don't you do me a favor.

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:34,625
Take yourself and your
holier-than-thou attitude

10
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:35,917
and get out of my life.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,542
This is insubordination,
Mr. Barclay.

12
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,125
Here's to insubordination.

13
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,291
Riker, you're nothing
but a pretty mannequin

14
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,834
in a fancy uniform.

15
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,667
You're full
of hot air.

16
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:08,166
If Picard has
a problem with me

17
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,250
you tell him to come
and talk to me himself.

18
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,750
I feel your confidence,

19
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:36,125
your arrogant resolve.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,792
It excites me.

21
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,750
CREWMAN:
Lieutenant Barclay,
report to cargo bay five<i> now.</i>

22
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,834
It'll have to wait
till later, darling.

23
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,458
(<i> loudly</i> ):
Be right there.

24
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,542
Save program.

25
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,000
I just don't know
what to do with him.

26
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,041
The guy's always late.

27
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,083
He never gives
his best effort.

28
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,250
Just slides by.

29
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,458
I'm telling you,
I can't deal with it anymore.

30
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,709
I mean, how does a guy like that
make it through the academy?

31
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,834
I think it's time we
spoke to the captain
about Broccoli.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,083
That's what Wesley
calls him.

33
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,291
You keep that
to yourself.

34
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,583
Well, it fits.

35
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,125
Commander, a broken seal.

36
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,375
Well, you better
destroy it.

37
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:40,917
Those samples
will be tainted.

Hey!

39
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:51,542
Is it a problem for you

40
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,959
to report to duty
on time, Lieutenant?

41
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,291
No... no, sir.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,041
I'm ... I'm very,
very sorry, sir.

43
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,375
It's just that I had a...

44
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,959
a very important communiqué,
which required

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,375
my immediate response.

46
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,625
I don't want to hear it.

47
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,959
Now, we're having
an intermittent problem

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,333
with this antigrav unit.

49
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,625
I want you to see
what you can do.

50
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,291
Mr. Barclay, I'm tired

51
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,083
of seeing
your name on report.

52
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,583
I don't know
what you got away with

53
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,458

Mr. Barclay.

82
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:23,542
Uh, I'll disassemble it
later, Commander.

83
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,542
It shouldn't do that.

84
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,208

I'm just not accustomed
to seeing

88
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:56,375
an unsatisfactory rating
on a member of my crew.

89
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,834
I guess the question

90
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,208
is whether Mr. Barclay
is<i> Enterprise</i> material.

91
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,291
And I assume
by your request for his transfer

92
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,625
that you think he's not,
Commander.

93
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,959
Well, I hate to say it, but...

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,333
I always thought
I could work with anybody

95
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,667
but I just don't
understand this guy.

96
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,625
Broccoli makes me nervous,
Captain.

97
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:13,959
He makes
everybody nervous.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Broccoli?

99
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,875
Young Mr. Crusher started that.

100
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,583
I guess it's caught on.

101
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,333
Let's just get that
"uncaught," shall we?

102
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,709
There's every
indication that he's

103
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,375
served competently
in Starfleet for years.

104
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,792
Ratings aboard the<i> Zhukov</i>
were satisfactory.

105
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:29,792
In fact, I recall
Captain Gleason

106
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,291
speaking quite highly of him
before his transfer.

107
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,917
In retrospect, I wonder

108
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,542
if Captain Gleason wasn't
buttering our bread a little.

109
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,041
He knew that we needed
a diagnostic engineer.

110
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,542
I've examined Barclay's
psychological profile.

111
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,750
He has a history
of seclusive tendencies.

112
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:45,792
It was noted at the academy
more than once.

113
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,625
And yet,
he chose this way of life.

114
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,709
He has made the same commitment
to Starfleet that we all have.

115
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

116
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,458
It's easy to transfer a problem
to someone else.

117
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,709
Too easy.

118
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,667
Captain, it's not
like I haven't tried.

119
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:01,166
Try harder, Geordi.

120
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,917
He's a member of your team.

121
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,083
Try to find some way

122
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,375
to help him to make
a positive contribution.

123
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:11,166
Get to know the man better.

124
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,166
Make him
your best friend.

125
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,041
With all due respect, sir,
"my best friend"?

126
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,291
I can barely tolerate being
in the same room with the man.

127
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,792
I suggest you put
your personal discomfort

128
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,458
on one side, Commander.

129
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,834
Dismissed.

130
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,083
Yes, sir.

131
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

132
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,500
Hey, Reg.

133
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,542
How, uh...
how's it going?

134
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,458
Oh, uh, it's...

135
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,750
I... I still
haven't traced down

136
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,875
the problem, Commander.

137
00:08:58,917 --> 00:08:59,875
It's all right.

138
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:01,250
There's no problem.

139
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,417
I've... I've been planning
to run diagnostics

140
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,250
on the graviton
inverter's circuits.

141
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,333
Smart plan.

142
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,458
I'd say we're
in good hands here.

143
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,792
Well, I'll see you get
a preliminary report...

144
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,208
Whenever.

145
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,792
Before the end of the day.

146
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:18,041
Fine. Fine.

147
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,875
Oh... say, Reg,

148
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,500
how about sitting in
on the mission briefing

149
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,125
with my senior officers
in the morning?

150
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,750
Th-the briefing? Me?

151
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,625
I'd like your input.

152
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,959
What on?

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,875
I mean, do...
do you want me to prepare...

154
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:36,500
No, no, just be there.

155
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,291
0800 hours.

156
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,250
I'll... I'll be on time, sir.

157
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,875
Good. Good.

158
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,291
Carry on.

159
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,125
Morning.

160
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,250
Start your brains,
gentlemen

161
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,125
and let's do it.

162
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,709
Has anybody seen
Lieutenant Barclay?

163
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,125
Not yet, sir.

164
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

165
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,709
Okay.

166
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,250
(<i> panting</i> )

167
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,625
Okay.

168
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,834
This trip to Nahmi IV
is pretty routine

169
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,291
so we'll have plenty of time to
realign the magnetic capacitors

170
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,125
of both the matter<i> and</i>
anti-matter injectors.

171
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,625
Duffy, Costa, that'll
be your assignment.

172
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,959
We probably ought to do
the flow regulator maintenance

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,500
at the same time, Commander.

174
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:31,709
That's a good idea.

175
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,375
Ensign Crusher will be

176
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,500
putting in some hours
with us this week

177
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,125
as part of his
training duties.

178
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,542
So, I'll be assigning
him to assist you, Mr. Myers.

179
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,917
Be sure and teach
him the difference

180
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,792
between impulse and
warp drive, please.

181
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:43,417
(<i> chuckling</i> )

182
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,417
Lieutenant Barclay has been
working on the mystery

183
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,917
of the antigrav failure
we had yesterday.

184
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,333
Your preliminary report

185
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,583
had a couple of interesting
theories, Reg.

186
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:54,291
Why don't you

187
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,583
bring us all up to speed
on your findings so far.

188
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,375
Yes.

189
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,333
It... it wasn't
a maintenance problem.

190
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,250
Every-everything
checked out.

191
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,542
I'm... I'm going to
look for a surge in
the transfer coils...

192
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,125
Oh, a coil surge
wouldn't have resulted
in field dissipation.

193
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,208
I-I... I realize that.

194
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,375
But we shouldn't ignore
the possibilities, Wes.

195
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:20,125
You ought to check
the flow capacitor.

196
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,375
A breakdown of that
could have caused

197
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,166
a chain collapse
of the antigrav fields.

198
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,458
I... I was going to.

199
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,125
Good.

200
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,625
Okay, then, let's, uh...

201
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,667
take a look
at that realignment procedure.

202
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:32,792
Gentlemen.

203
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,709
DUFFY:
Yeah, the bipolar
flux device was...

204
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,083
COSTA:
Commander...

205
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,291
I just didn't know what to say.

206
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,041
What do you wish
you had said?

207
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,583
I should have told him
to mind his own damn business.

208
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,875
I knew about
the flux capacitor

209
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,208
but I didn't need to
hear about it

210
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,583
from some
17-year-old kid.

211
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,333
You're letting this
get you much too upset.

212
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,583
You think so?

213
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,125
Why are you so
hard on yourself?

214
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,625
You don't know.

215
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,500
It's hard out there.

216
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:14,583
I understand,
but let go of it.

217
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,750
You're here now.

218
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:20,041
You're right, of course.

219
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,000
Of course.

220
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:26,417
Let me help you relax.

221
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,542
I'd like that.

222
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,083
I knew you would.

223
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:42,125
Mmm, that's nice...

224
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:46,041
But... I'm in the mood

225
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:50,000
for someplace
a little more...

226
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,917
unusual.

227
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,375
Computer,
run Barclay program 15.

228
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:07,625
I am the goddess of empathy.

229
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:12,458
Cast off your inhibitions

230
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,834
and embrace love,

231
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,083
truth, joy.

232
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,875
But I thought that's
the point of the briefing--

233
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,250
to discuss
different approaches...

234
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,375
It's not that you did
anything wrong, Wes.

235
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,375
It's just that Barclay's...

236
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,208
Well, he's my new project.

237
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,500
Yeah, Broccoli's a real project,
all right.

238
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,542
I just need to draw him out
some more.

239
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,333
And I shut him down.

240
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,083
Poor Broccoli.

241
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,125
Pardon me.

242
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,166
But why is Lieutenant Barclay
being referred to

243
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,500
clandestinely
as a vegetable?

244
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,583
It's a joke, Data.

245
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,750
You know, a nickname?

246
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:14,417
Nicknames generally denote
fondness.

247
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,291
A diminutive shared
between friends.

248
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,375
Data's absolutely right.

249
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:22,125
The nickname stops here and now.

250
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,667
Captain's orders.

251
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:29,458
What..? What the hell..?

252
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,500
What happened to your glass?

253
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,542
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

254
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,625
Nucleosynthesis.

255
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,834
The structure of the glass

256
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,709
has been altered
at the atomic level.

257
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,291
Problem with
the replicator?

258
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,375
Unlikely.

259
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:01,625
A problem
with the replicator

260
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,667
would have effected
the contents

261
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:03,834
as well as the glass

262
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,417
but the liquid in the glass

263
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:09,375
was a synthehol replication
of a light ale of earth origin

264
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:12,250
which is, I believe,
what Lieutenant Duffy ordered.

265
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,208
Well, I can't detect
any residual radiation

266
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,750
or any unusual
chemical compounds

267
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,542
that would have
caused this.

268
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,959
The most probable explanation

269
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,959
is that the glass
came into contact

270
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,625
with an unshielded
power source.

271
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,834
Ugh... that means a complete
diagnostic check

272
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,667
of the<i> Enterprise</i> 
power systems--

273
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,667
all 4,000 of them.

274
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:30,875
But do I have the
perfect man for the job.

275
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:31,875
Hey, Reg.

276
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,709
You busy?

277
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,875
I-I was just...

278
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:36,375
Uh, no.

279
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,291
Not really.
Why?

280
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,166
Got another mystery for you.

281
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,333
Somehow the molecular structure
of this cup from Ten-Forward

282
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,542
has been altered.

283
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,875
We need to run
through the power systems

284
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,709
to see if there's a leak
that caused this.

285
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,667
I had, uh...

286
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:56,458
I was going to do that.

287
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,417
You were?

288
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,792
Yes, to try to explain

289
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,417
the antigrav unit failure.

290
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,041
I still can't.

291
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,000
Nothing about it makes sense.

292
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,041
Then it is possible that these
two very disparate incidents

293
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,333
could be related.

294
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,417
I wouldn't bother you with
something this minor, Commander

295
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,375
but it may be a symptom
of a more serious problem.

296
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,959
Do you think we'll need
to put in to a starbase?

297
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,417
We'll have a better idea

298
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,625
after Mr. Barclay runs a check
on the power systems.

299
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:31,583
It was Lieutenant Barclay
who first suggested

300
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,750
a link between
the two incidents.

301
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,917
What?

302
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,625
No, it wasn't.
I mean, not really.

303
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,250
Will your investigation

304
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,041
affect our available power
during the mission?

305
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,792
No... no, sir.

306
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:47,750
We'll have to shut off
some systems.

307
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,583
We'll, uh... shut them
down a few at a time.

308
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,250
It shouldn't...

309
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,667
I don't think so.

310
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:55,583
Good.

311
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,583
I'll look forward
to your report, Mr. Broccoli.

312
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:03,375
Barclay.

313
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,667
If you will excuse me.

314
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,667
Metathesis is one
of the most common

315
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,083
of pronunciation
errors, sir.

316
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,792
A reversal of vowel
and consonant.

317
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:21,500
"Barc" to "Broc"...

318
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,166
Yes, I know him.

319
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,875
He comes in.
He stands at the bar.

320
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,250
He doesn't say much.

321
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,208
He orders a warm milk.

322
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,083
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Figures.

323
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,041
Warm milk helps you sleep,
La Forge.

324
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,083
You should try it.

325
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,792
What's this have to do
with Barclay?

326
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:47,166
I don't know.

327
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,208
I'm just trying
to figure the man out.

328
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,166
Do you ever talk to him?

329
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,125
He doesn't talk much.

330
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,583
Does he have
any friends?

331
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,291
Not that I've seen.

332
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

333
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,709
What do you do
with a guy like that?

334
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,917
Well, I just serve
him warm milk

335
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:04,542
and let him be.

336
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,625
Yeah, well,
I'm not so lucky.

337
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,333
I can't let him be.

338
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,417
He's my problem.

339
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,792
Hmm.

340
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:13,834
Well, he's...

341
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,041
imaginative.

342
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,333
How do you know that?

343
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,834
I know.

344
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,917
Well, then maybe he's
in the wrong line of work.

345
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,291
Hmm.

346
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,250
You engineering types

347
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,625
don't appreciate imagination?

348
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,834
That's not it, Guinan.

349
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,709
He just doesn't fit in here.

350
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:36,291
Oh.

351
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,667
Terkim.

352
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,083
What?

353
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,291
Reminds me of Terkim.

354
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,667
My mother's brother.

355
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,875
Sort of the family misfit.

356
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,291
Everybody told me
to stay away from him.

357
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,458
Bad influence.

358
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,458
Did you?

359
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,959
Are you kidding?

360
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,542
He was the only member
of my family

361
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,959
who had a sense of humor.

362
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,375
Except no one ever stayed
around him long enough

363
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,125
to realize it but me.

364
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:04,000
My mother tells me I remind her
of him, and I probably do.

365
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,041
The idea of fitting in

366
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,208
just... repels me.

367
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,083
Maybe I'm not
making myself clear, Guinan.

368
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,917
Barclay--

369
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:17,208
well, he's always late.

370
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,750
The man's nervous.

371
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,083
Nobody wants
to be around this guy.

372
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,959
If I felt that nobody
wanted to be around me

373
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,667
I'd probably be late
and nervous, too.

374
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,333
Guinan, that's not the point.

375
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,083
Are you sure?

376
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,834
Excuse me.

377
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,125
Computer,
where is Lieutenant Barclay?

378
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,333
(<i> birds singing</i> )

379
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,583
(<i> holodeck doors close</i> )

380
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,750
Reg?

381
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:17,792
Beverly?

382
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:20,000
Good morning, milord.

383
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,709
Manners, my son, manners.

384
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,333
You embarrass me
before our guest.

385
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,291
Master Barclay
will spank you
if you misbehave.

386
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,917
Wesley?

387
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,959
What do<i> you</i> want?

388
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,792
Well, I guess
I want<i> Master</i> Barclay.

389
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,083
The boys got into another
little scrap, I'm afraid

390
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,959
but boys will be boys.

391
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,709
(<i> swords clashing,</i>
<i>men grunting</i> )

392
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,750
You cannot withstand our
assault forever, Barclay.

393
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:55,750
Ah!

394
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:57,625
Ha!

395
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,875
DATA:
You are outnumbered,
Mr. Barclay.

396
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,917
Say you will yield,
and it ends here.

397
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:10,667
I shall speak
with my sword, sir.

398
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,500
Ha!

399
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:38,959
In God's name

400
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,709
where did you learn
to fight like this?

401
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,000
Self-taught,
my<i> Capitaine.</i>

402
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,917
Shall I give you
a few lessons?

403
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,250
PICARD:
Who is that?

404
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,917
One of your allies?

405
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,583
Oh, Jean-Luc

406
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,834
not that old trick.

407
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,917
I'm very disappointed in you.

408
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,834
(<i> clears throat</i> )

409
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:12,834
I'll make it easy
for you, Commander.

410
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,792
I will request
a reassignment.

411
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,291
Now, wait...
Look, we both know--

412
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,041
The whole ship knows...

413
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,959
I... I just can't
cut it here.

414
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,458
Hey, Barclay

415
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,000
I've spent a few hours
on the holodeck, too, you know.

416
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,417
Now, as far
as I'm concerned

417
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,417
what you do in the holodeck
is your own business

418
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,208
as long as it doesn't
interfere with your work.

419
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,959
So you're...

420
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,709
you're not going to
tell anyone about this?

421
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,000
I don't think everybody

422
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:43,291
would appreciate
your imagination like I do.

423
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,959
It is kind of unusual

424
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,291
recreating people
you already know.

425
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,834
Well, it was just...

426
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:02,542
I needed to blow
off some steam

427
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,417
because one...
one of the officers

428
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,625
had been getting
on my back.

429
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,500
Let me guess.

430
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:13,125
(<i> laughs</i> )

431
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,333
It was you.

432
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,083
And I just couldn't tell you

433
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,458
what I wanted to tell you
to your face

434
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,166
so it just sort
of got out of control.

435
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,250
I don't know, there's a part of
this

436
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:27,125
that's kind of therapeutic.

437
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,959
Maybe you ought to talk
to Counselor Troi about it.

438
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,375
It's, it's... I'm ...

439
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:35,375
when I'm in there,
I'm just more comfortable.

440
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:38,959
You don't know what a struggle
this has been for me, Commander.

441
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,291
Well, I'd like to help if I can.

442
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,041
Being afraid
all of the time

443
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,834
of forgetting somebody's name

444
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:49,834
not... not knowing what to do
with your hands.

445
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:53,750
I mean, I am the guy
who writes down

446
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:56,959
things to remember to say
when there's a party.

447
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,792
And then when he
finally gets there

448
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:01,583
he winds up alone,

449
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,250
in the corner

450
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,208
trying to look
comfortable

451
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,834
examining a potted plant.

452
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,709
You're just shy, Barclay.

453
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,166
"Just shy."

454
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:18,583
sounds like nothing serious,
doesn't it?

455
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,041
You can't know.

456
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,166
O'Brien to La Forge.

457
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,583
Go ahead.

458
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,208
I need you in transporter
room three, Commander.

459
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,834
On my way, Chief.

460
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,792
Listen, Reg.

461
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,458
I really do want you
to talk to Counselor Troi.

462
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,625
Troi?

463
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:42,834
No, no, no, no, no.
I... I couldn't.

464
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,291
I mean it.

465
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:47,250
As your friend
and as your commanding officer.

466
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:55,792
I was synchronizing
the phase transition coils.

467
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:59,125
I didn't do anything
I haven't done 100 times before.

468
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,834
The test object
is made of pure duranium.

469
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,917
Seems normal
enough to me.

470
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,375
Watch this.

471
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,542
Glad I don't have
anywhere to go.

472
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:36,625
LA FORGE:
<i>Chief Engineer's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43808.2.</i>

473
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,500
<i>A systems analysis</i>

474
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,291
<i>has yielded no suggestion</i>
<i>of a cause</i>

475
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,792
<i>for the latest malfunction</i>
<i>aboard the</i> Enterprise.

476
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,000
This part of the same pattern?

477
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,875
We don't know, sir.

478
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:47,875
And we don't know why
only transporter room
three is affected.

479
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,583
None of the other transporter
rooms are malfunctioning.

480
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,166
Yet.

481
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:52,667
We reach Nahmi IV in 22 hours.

482
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:54,875
We'll want all transporters
operational by then.

483
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:57,250
I want a level-1 diagnostic

484
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,375
across the board.

485
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,667
Advise Mr. Barclay to join us
on the bridge immediately.

486
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:04,250
Oh, can we make
that 1400 hours, sir?

487
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:05,667
I've got him working
on something.

488
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:07,458
1400 hours.

489
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,333
Mr. O'brien, no maintenance
on the transporter

490
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,458
until further notice.

491
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,709
Aye, sir.

492
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:17,583
I know this is
difficult for you.

493
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,875
Is there anything I can do
to make you more comfortable?

494
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:23,458
No.

495
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,625
Have you ever been
with a counselor before?

496
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,125
Yes... no.

497
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,542
Which one?

498
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:33,417
Yes, but she, uh...

499
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:37,583
It-it wasn't...

500
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,500
it wasn't really a counselor.

501
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,500
Most people find a counselor
intimidating at first.

502
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's okay if you feel
that way toward me.

503
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:53,792
Not... at all.

504
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:55,583
Good.

505
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,875
Now, lean back,

506
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,500
close your eyes...

507
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,333
Why?

508
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,500
I want to make you
more comfortable.

509
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,625
You do?

510
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,166
Yes.

511
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,333
It's okay.

512
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,625
Close your eyes.

513
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:22,000
What are you
going to do?

514
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:25,208
Just listen to the sound
of my voice.

515
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,875
Take a slow, deep breath
in through your nose...

516
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:35,583
... and let it out through
your mouth just as slowly.

517
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:43,542
That's better, isn't it?

518
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:45,709
Much better.

519
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,083
Oh, yes.

520
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,583
Oh, yes, that's...
that's much better.

521
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,667
That... that...
that is extremely helpful.

522
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:53,875
Thank you
for your time.

523
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:56,500
But...
Really, that's
very helpful.

524
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,834
In through the nose

525
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,792
out through the mouth.

526
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:04,041
I'm going to practice that
and I'll-I'll let you know.

527
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,333
Thank you again.

528
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:08,625
Whoa...oh

529
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,583
I had a very
strange visit

530
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,792
from one of your
officers today.

531
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:26,208
Barclay?

532
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,792
Yeah, I can imagine.

533
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:30,375
Were you able to do
anything for him?

534
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,917
To be honest I'm not
sure what happened.

535
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,458
Where is Mr. Barclay?

536
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,750
It's past 1400 hours.

537
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,250
Lieutenant Barclay,
report to the bridge.

538
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,709
Lieutenant Barclay, report.

539
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:49,834
Computer,
locate Lieutenant Barclay.

540
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,041
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Barclay
is in holodeck two.

541
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:55,625
(<i> sighs</i> ):
I'll get him.

542
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:56,792
No, I'll
handle this.

543
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:58,125
I've had it with him.

544
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,041
Counselor, you'd
better come along.

545
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:07,875
I think
you should know

546
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:10,000
Barclay's been running
some unique programs.

547
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,166
I don't care
what he's been running.

548
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,000
I just ran out of patience.

549
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:21,208
(<i> birds singing</i> )

550
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:28,667
(<i> men laughing in the distance</i> )

551
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:30,083
(<i> holodeck door closes</i> )

552
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,250
PICARD:
...before our swords.

553
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:36,250
MEN:
Hear, hear.

554
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,792
(<i> laughter</i> )

555
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:39,834
PICARD:
I hope she was worth
the effort.

556
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,250
GEORDIE:
Oh. Show us how you did it.

557
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,041
DATA:
Like this!

558
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:44,333
Ah!

559
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,291
Like I said, Commander

560
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:01,500
Barclay's been running
some unusual programs.

561
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:03,166
This is a violation
of protocol.

562
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:06,208
Crewmembers should not be
simulated in the holodeck.

563
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,333
LA FORGE:
Commander, I don't
think there's any

564
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,500
regulation against...

565
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,375
Well, there ought to be.

566
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,250
Computer, discontinue
program and erase.

567
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,500
Computer, belay that order.

568
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:16,000
Counselor?

569
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:19,625
If Barclay is having
difficulty facing reality

570
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:22,417
to suddenly destroy
his only means of escape

571
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,500
would be brutal

572
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:26,125
and could do
considerable damage.

573
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:29,834
They are quite disagreeable,
aren't they?

574
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,125
Mmm.

575
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:37,166
Shall we...
have at them?

576
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,709
Delighted!

577
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,250
GEORDIE:
We shall thrash them.

578
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,250
En garde!

579
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:43,208
Stop it.

580
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,250
Put that down.

581
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:45,667
Your sword, sir.

582
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,208
I don't have a sword.

583
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,667
How do you expect to fight
without your sword, sir?

584
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:54,458
I don't expect to fight.

585
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,583
Ha!

586
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,417
Do I detect
a streak of yellow

587
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:01,000
along the good
fellow's back?

588
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:04,250
(<i> laughing</i> )

589
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,000
Perhaps we should supply

590
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,500
a more appropriate
adversary for him.

591
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:09,542
GEORDIE:
Aha, indeed.

592
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,709
Number one?

593
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,792
Number one!

594
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,375
RIKER:
Here I come.

595
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:16,542
Am I late?

596
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,583
Did I miss the fight?

597
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:19,750
En garde!

598
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:22,291
You, sir, you have
a familiar bearing.

599
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:25,208
Is it possible our swords
have crossed somewhere before?

600
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,709
Where is he?

601
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,291
Where's Barclay?

602
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,583
Aha! A personal grudge.

603
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,083
I warn you, it would
be wise for you

604
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,792
to put your affairs
in final order

605
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,709
before you meet him
in combat.

606
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,000
You challenge
the greatest sword...

607
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,291
In all the holodeck.

608
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,083
(<i> stifles laughter</i> )

609
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:45,959
You think this is funny?

610
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,583
You<i> are</i> very tall.

611
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,625
It might be threatening
to some people.

612
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,166
Mr. Barclay will find out
what it means to be threatened.

613
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:57,208
Computer,
discontinue image of Riker.

614
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,583
Sir!

615
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,959
You have no sense of fair play.

616
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Just tell us
where to find Barclay.

617
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:14,917
You want us to
search through all
this to find him?

618
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:17,875
It could provide us
with valuable information

619
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,500
about what's troubling him.

620
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,041
You know, there's nothing wrong
with a healthy fantasy life

621
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,959
as long as you
don't let it take over.

622
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,500
You call this healthy?

623
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:29,792
You're taking it
so seriously.

624
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:32,333
It's not without
its element of humor.

625
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,834
I am the goddess

626
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,959
of empathy.

627
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,333
Cast off your inhibitions

628
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,500
and embrace love

629
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,583
truth, joy.

630
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,667
Oh... my... God.

631
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:48,792
Discard your facades
and reveal

632
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,667
your true being to me.

633
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:51,709
Computer, discontinue...

634
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,291
Computer, belay
that order.

635
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,959
We want to get
more insight
into what's

636
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,959
been troubling this
poor man, remember?

637
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:01,792
Quite a healthy
fantasy life

638
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:02,959
wouldn't you say?

639
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,208
Mmm.

640
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:08,792
(<i> rumbling</i> )

641
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:10,750
(<i> console beeping</i> )

642
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:12,291
Report.

643
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,208
WORF:
Sir, our velocity
increased to warp 7.25.

644
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,500
Compensating, sir.

645
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:19,125
Confirmed.

646
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,625
Velocity now warp seven.

647
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,375
Maintain that.

648
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:26,583
What the hell happened?

649
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,291
The matter/anti-matter
injectors locked

650
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,458
for a split second.

651
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,667
I am not certain why, sir.

652
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,208
They appear to be
working normally now.

653
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,291
Picard to La Forge.

654
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:35,917
LA FORGE: Go ahead,
Captain.

655
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:38,291
Commander, any explanation
for this injector problem?

656
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:41,166
Well, um, I'm not
in engineering, sir.

657
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,500
I'm in holodeck two.

658
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,667
PICARD:
Another malfunction?

659
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:48,083
Not exactly, but I'll
return to engineering
immediately, sir.

660
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,583
Yes, I should say
that you should, Commander.

661
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,583
Your holodeck activities
can wait until later.

662
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:53,542
And, Commander...

663
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,000
Yes, sir.

664
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,083
It would be wise to consult
Lieutenant Barclay

665
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,458
on this latest incident.

666
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,959
I'd like to
very much, Captain.

667
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,208
La Forge out.

668
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:05,208
We need to find
Barclay<i> now.</i>

669
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,291
Cast aside your masks

670
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,959
and let me slip into your minds.

671
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,542
Muzzle it.

672
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:24,458
(<i> loud snoring</i> )

673
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,667
Shh.

674
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:43,417
We have a lot to talk
about, Mr. Barclay.

675
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,625
Commander,
Barclay and I

676
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:45,834
had better get
to engineering.

677
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,291
Dismissed.

678
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,583
I just couldn't
keep my eyes open.

679
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,667
I'd worked 12 hours
on the power systems

680
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:58,667
and then... then the
transporter went down.

681
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:00,625
Reg, you had a chance
to get some help

682
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:02,125
from the real
Counselor Troi

683
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,041
but, instead, you
went back in there.

684
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:05,375
I know.
I didn't want to.

685
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:07,041
I just couldn't
help myself.

686
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:10,000
You're going to be
able to write the
book on holodiction.

687
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,083
Look, I know
how easy it is

688
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,291
to get caught
up in it.

689
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,709
I fell in love
in there once.

690
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,375
Really?
But I knew when
it was time

691
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:16,583
to turn it off
and say good-bye.

692
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:17,959
It wasn't easy,
but I did it.

693
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,375
You know, the people
that I create in there

694
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,625
are more real to me

695
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,875
than anyone I meet out here.

696
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,291
Except...

697
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,750
maybe you,
Commander.

698
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:34,625
I need you
out here, Reg.

699
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,125
Now more than ever.

700
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,458
Huh?

701
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,583
The injectors aren't responding
to the diagnostic commands.

702
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:50,875
I think we should
drop out of warp.

703
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:52,041
La Forge to bridge.

704
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,583
Go ahead, Commander.

705
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:55,875
Recommend we go
to impulse power, Captain.

706
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:57,166
Take us out of warp.

707
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,166
Controls are not
responding, sir.

708
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,166
It's the injectors.

709
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:03,125
Override.

710
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:05,750
It's not
a computer problem.

711
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,959
The mechanism is
physically jammed.

712
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,834
I can't clear it.

713
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:12,208
Speed increasing, sir.

714
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,750
Warp 7.6.

715
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:15,709
7.65.

716
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,125
Warp 7.7.

717
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,333
We can't shut it
down, Captain.

718
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,000
Anti-matter flow
is... increasing.

719
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,125
She's accelerating
out of control.

720
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,959
There's nothing I can do.

721
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,041
Approaching
warp nine, sir.

722
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,875
Red alert.

723
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:44,041
Estimated time
to structural failure?

724
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:47,291
At this rate of acceleration--
15 minutes, 40 seconds, sir.

725
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,667
Did you copy that, Geordi?

726
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:49,709
Aye, Commander.

727
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,959
Recommendations?

728
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,125
I'll let you know
as soon as we have some.

729
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,709
La Forge out.

730
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,083
Okay, this ship
is going to start

731
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,917
tearing itself apart
in 15 minutes.

732
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:59,750
I want every idea on the table,
I don't care how outrageous.

733
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:01,417
What about attempting
a magnetic quench

734
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:02,750
on the fusion
pre-burners?

735
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:03,917
No, I already tried that.

736
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:05,625
The magnetic fields won't reset.

737
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,417
Could the fuel inlet servos
be caught in cycle?

738
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,792
If they were,
the swirl dampers

739
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:10,333
would be frozen, too,
and they aren't.

740
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:13,000
Nothing showed up
in the diagnostic sweep, at all?

741
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:14,291
The tests showed
there were proble...

742
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,750
I mean, there were
<i>no</i> problems

743
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:17,542
with the fl-flow...
the flow of the...

744
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,625
There's nothing wrong
with the computer
control protocols

745
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,041
or the power
transfer systems.

746
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,625
As far as we can
determine the injectors

747
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:24,500
are just
physically jammed.

748
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,083
Injectors freeze,
antigrav unit goes down

749
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,500
transporter malfunctions...

750
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:29,750
And a twisted glass.

751
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:30,792
What's the connection?

752
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,583
(<i> rumbling</i> )

753
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:37,250
Exceeding warp 9.4.

754
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:40,041
Begin evacuation
of secondary hull.

755
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:43,792
Prepare for emergency
saucer separation.

756
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:46,417
Standing by to release
docking clamps.

757
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,458
Re-route systems
to primary hull power sources.

758
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,417
The plasma flow to the nacelles
is uneven due to injector lock.

759
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:55,208
An emergency saucer separation
could rupture the warp field.

760
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,834
(<i> rumbling</i> )

761
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,458
(<i> console beeping insistently</i> )

762
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,875
12 minutes
to structural failure, sir.

763
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:06,917
None of the
systems involved

764
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,125
interact directly
with each other.

765
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,583
I don't see
anything in common.

766
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,792
Wh-what if... what if...

767
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:13,083
what if one of us
<i>is</i> the connection?

768
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,625
Us? How?

769
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,291
I don't know.

770
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:20,333
But we're looking
for a systemic explanation

771
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,333
and there isn't one.

772
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:25,041
I mean, we work with
all of the systems
that are affected.

773
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:26,834
What if...

774
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:30,291
what if we're transmitting
something ourselves...

775
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,500
by touching it, or something?

776
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,750
The computer would have
picked up anything dangerous.

777
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:36,625
But... if it were something,

778
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:39,333
something that
we<i> couldn't</i> scan

779
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,917
you might have passed it on

780
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:42,500
to the injectors
when you were re-aligning

781
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:44,041
the magnetic capacitors.

782
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,041
It was your glass, Duffy,
and both of you were present

783
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,458
in the cargo bay
when the antigrav failed.

784
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,083
Well, so was O'Brien.

785
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,125
The transporter malfunction--
that's a connection, too.

786
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:53,083
(<i> alarm beeps loudly</i> )
COMPUTER: Danger!

787
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:55,709
Approaching safety limits
of engine containment field.

788
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,000
Computer,
list all physical substances

789
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:00,625
that wouldn't normally be
picked up by an internal scan.

790
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:03,959
There are 15,525
known substances

791
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,583
that cannot be detected

792
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,333
by standard scans.

793
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:10,333
Great, and how many of those can
exist in an oxygen atmosphere?

794
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:12,125
Five hundred thirty-two.

795
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,917
<i>And</i> could alter
molecular structure

796
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:16,458
when it comes in contact with...
with glass?

797
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,542
Five.

798
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,083
On screen at this station.

799
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,875
Duffy.

800
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,750
BARCLAY:
Jakmanite has a half-life
of 15 seconds.

801
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:28,250
There wouldn't be enough time
to spread it around the ship.
Right.

802
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:31,083
Selgninaem and lucrovexitrin
are highly toxic.

803
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,333
Yeah, we'd all be dead by now.

804
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:34,667
That leaves...
saltzgadum and invidium.

805
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:36,458
Neither of which has been used
for decades.

806
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,166
But could either one of them
cause all these malfunctions?

807
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,125
Most of the affected systems
weren't even invented

808
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:42,542
when those substances
were in use.

809
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,959
Who knows what could happen

810
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,875
with a transporter
or a magnetic capacitor.

811
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,542
Wait a minute,
wasn't invidium used

812
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,709
in medical containment fields?

813
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,208
Not for over a century.

814
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,417
The Mikulaks
might still be using it.

815
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:55,000
And one of those canisters
was broken.

816
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:56,125
La Forge to bridge.

817
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,000
We have a working theory,
Captain.

818
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,166
There's a good possibility
we picked up some invidium

819
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,709
from a broken canister
in the cargo bay

820
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,333
and have been spreading it
around the ship.

821
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,166
Working theories
are fine, Geordi

822
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:07,333
but we need a working solution
in about five minutes.

823
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,792
Understood, Commander.

824
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:11,375
We're on our way to cargo bay
five for confirmation.

825
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,417
Nothing on the tricorder.

826
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,500
(<i> alarm beeps loudly</i> )

827
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:32,250
COMPUTER: Danger.

828
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:35,709
Exceeding safety limits
of engine containment field.

829
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,792
At current acceleration

830
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:41,500
structural failure will occur
in three minutes, 30 seconds.

831
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,625
If it's in there,
it should show up

832
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:48,417
on one of the
polarity channels.

833
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:55,417
There it is.

834
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,583
Duffy and O'Brien picked up
the broken canister

835
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:58,834
and became contaminated.

836
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,917
If we can get it--
the invidium--

837
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,333
down to minus 200 degrees
celsius, it'll become inert.

838
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,125
La Forge to bridge.

839
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:07,542
Invidium has been confirmed.

840
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:10,083
Recommend we flood
the injector pathway conduit

841
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:11,291
with gaseous cryonetrium.

842
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,125
That ought to neutralize it.

843
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,875
The question is, will the
injectors come back on-line?

844
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:18,500
They sustained
considerable damage, Captain.

845
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,542
I can't guarantee that we'll
be able to regain control.

846
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:22,917
We don't have
much choice, do we?

847
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:24,375
No, sir.

848
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:25,834
Make it so.

849
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,500

00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:58,875
Matter injector is on-line.

861

Nice work, Geordi.

871

Mr. Barclay and I
thank you, sir.

872
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:35,917
RIKER:
Acknowledged.

873
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:37,250
The ship has been
seriously contaminated

874
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,500
with invidium, sir.

875
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:40,875
Recommend we set a course
for Starbase 121

876
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:44,208
for a complete systems-
and bio-decontamination.

877
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,792
Understood.
Picard out.

878
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:49,875
Glad you were with us

879
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:52,333
out here in the real
world today, Mr. Barclay.

880
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:20,959
It has been most difficult

881
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,875
to reach this decision
to leave you

882
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:26,041
but after thinking about it

883
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:28,792
and discussing it
at length with...

884
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:30,667
Counselor Troi

885
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:32,583
I think it's
for the best.

886
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:37,709
I just wanted to thank you all
for your support.

887
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,917
You'll always be
welcome here, Reg.

888
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,375
I know.

889
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:46,166
That's why
it's so difficult to leave.

890
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:52,000
It was a pleasure to serve
with you, Mr. Barclay.

891
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,250
Good luck, Reg.

892
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,750
