00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:04,875
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44307.3.</i>

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:08,041
<i>I am preparing to leave</i>
<i>by shuttlecraft for Pentarus V</i>

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,792
<i>where I've been asked</i>
<i>to mediate a dispute</i>

4
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:12,917
<i>among the salenite miners,</i>
<i>a contentious group</i>

5
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:15,709
<i>unfortunately,</i>
<i>prone to violence.</i>

6
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:18,667
<i>But first, I must deal</i>
<i>with a situation</i>

7
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,959
<i>of a far more personal nature.</i>

8
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,792
Sir?

9
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,875
Mr. Crusher,
I summoned you

10
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,166
almost ten minutes ago.

11
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,667
Sir, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,166
I was in the middle
of a very important experiment.

13
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,709
I was using some
very volatile compounds.

14
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:37,709
I couldn't just leave them...

15
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:39,041
Excuses, Mr. Crusher?

16
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,250
No, sir. I was just
attempting to offer...

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,709
Because I can assure you

18
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,959
that will not go down well
at Starfleet Academy.

19
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,041
Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.

20
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,500
The Academy?

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,333
I just received a message
from Admiral Nsomeka.

22
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,917
She expects you to
report in two weeks.

23
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:03,250
A position has opened up
in this year's class.

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,542
Thank you.

25
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,458
Now, you're going to
have to work overtime

26
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,125
in order to catch up

27
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,625
but I have assured the Admiral
that you are capable of it.

28
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,667
Please, don't make
a liar out of me.

29
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:15,041
Oh, no, sir, I won't.

30
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,333
Well, for your final mission
on board the<i> Enterprise</i>

31
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,709
you will accompany me
to Pentarus V

32
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,166
while I try to sort out the
problems with the miners.

33
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,417
Commander Riker has told me
that you have been studying

34
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:27,750
the effects of outpost
judiciary decisions

35
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,166
on Federation law.

36
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,250
What better way to get
first-hand experience?

37
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,333
Captain, I am picking up

38
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,166
a general distress signal
from Gamelan V.

39
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,250
On screen.

40
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,125
Please, does anyone read us?

41
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,709
Open a channel.

42
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,542
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard

43
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:49,834
of the Federation
Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

44
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:54,083
Captain, I am Chairman Songi
of Gamelan V.

45
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,000
An unidentified spacecraft

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,041
has entered orbit
above our planet.

47
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,542
Radiation levels
in our atmosphere

48
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:03,083
have increased by 3,000 percent.

49
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,250
We can only assume
we are under attack

50
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,667
but the ship will not answer
our hails.

51
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,625
We are a peaceful planet.

52
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,375
We have no ability
to defend ourselves.

53
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,709
Please, can you help us?

54
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,500
Mr. Data, are we close enough
for a scan?

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,333
No, sir, we are
out of range.

56
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,375
Any other ships
in that sector?

57
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,291
Negative, Commander.

58
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,500
Chairman Songi, we'll proceed
immediately to your planet.

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,458
Thank you, Captain.

60
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,834
Commander Riker,
take the<i> Enterprise</i>

61
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,417
and investigate
the problem.

62
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:36,583
Ensign Crusher and I will
proceed to Pentarus V.

63
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,834
The miners have
sent a shuttle.

64
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,083
We shall leave
in ten minutes.

65
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,875
Yes, sir.

66
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,625
LA FORGE:
You know, I've noticed here

67
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,291
that your maneuvering thrusters

68
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:56,125
are rigged in a configuration
I've never seen before.

69
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,417
It's my own modification.

70
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,625
It's more efficient.

71
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,875
You can study
it if you want.

72
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,667
(<i> door opens</i> )

73
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,709
Excuse me, Captain.

74
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,750
I've run safety and operational
inspections, Captain.

75
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,166
Everything checks out all right

76
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,667
but I won't make any claims
as to its comfort.

77
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,083
Captain Picard.

78
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,041
Captain Dirgo
of the Shuttlecraft<i> Nenebek.</i>

79
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,750
Ah, Captain.

80
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,583
It's good to meet you.

81
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,792
Captain?
Of a mining shuttle?

82
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,750
Yes, Ensign,<i> Captain.</i>

83
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,959
My ship isn't pretty.

84
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,417
She isn't big.

85
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,417
But we've logged almost
10,000 hours together.

86
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:40,417
Oh, yes.

87
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:42,375
She seems a very...

88
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,083
a very sturdy craft.

89
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,166
We should go.

90
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,166
Captain, will you take Ops?

91
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,333
I'll let Ensign Crusher
perform that task.

92
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,458
I have to study up
on Regalian law.

93
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,709
Shuttlecraft has
cleared the bay, sir.

94
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,000
Ensign Allenby, set a course
for the Gamelan system.

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,208
Warp six.

96
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,458
Aye, sir.

97
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,125
You've done this before.

98
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,375
Yes.

99
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,625
Your Captain back there, if he
isn't tougher than he looks

100
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,792
those miners
will tear him apart.

101
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,959
Don't worry
about Captain Picard.

102
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,000
He'll handle them.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,208
(<i> power shutting down</i> )

104
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,250
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

105
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,625
I've lost
navigation.

106
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,542
The port thruster quad's gone.

107
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:43,000
Guidance coupling system
severed.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,709
I can't stabilize her.

109
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:21,375
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

110
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:25,625
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

111
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,625
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

112
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:31,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

113
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:35,583
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

114
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:40,375
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,208
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

116
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,583
The port thruster
module blew.

117
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,083
<i>Nenebek</i> to<i> Enterprise.</i>
Emergency.

118
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,583
Do you read?

119
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Pentarus Station, come in.

120
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Communication's gone.

121
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,125
Is your navigational
system functioning?

122
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,333
Negative.
Switching to manual.

123
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,417
50 million kilometers
to Pentarus V.

124
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,750
We may have to put down
somewhere else.

125
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,250
Mr. Crusher, scan
for a Class-M environment.

126
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,625
Aye, sir.

127
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,417
I'm going to have
to throttle back

128
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:14,166
on the main impulse engines.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,625
Sir, one of the moons
around Pentarus III--

130
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,875
it registers as Class-M

131
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,041
barely.

132
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,417
The mean surface temperature

133
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:25,166
is 55 degrees Celsius.

134
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,417
Life-forms indicated?

135
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:28,750
Uh, negative, but
scanning is limited.

136
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,375
There's a very strong magnetic
field around the surface.

137
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,834
We don't have a choice.

138
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:44,375
Save the impulse engine
for controlled entry.

139
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:48,917
Mr. Crusher,
reconfigure working
thrusters to manual input.

140
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:51,625
I'll try, sir, but this grid
looks about 100 years old.

141
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,583
We don't have
the Federation's resources.

142
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,917
Captain, take the helm.

143
00:07:57,917 --> 00:08:00,417
I'm re-routing
the deuterium flow.

144
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,333
Hull temperature 700 degrees.

145
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,208
Beginning braking maneuver.

146
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,750
We're below Mach One.

147
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,917
Bypass to
thrusters now.

148
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,375
Brace yourselves for impact.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,959
(<i> hatch squeaking</i> )

150
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,583
Dear God.

151
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,583
Let's salvage what we can.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,375
The first thing we'll need
is shelter from the sun.

153
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,166
In this heat

154
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:08,083
the shuttle will
act like an oven.

155
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,041
All the systems are out.

156
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,542
Can't get
a communication channel.

157
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:17,875
Location transponder's
gone, too.

158
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,333
Let's check the craft

159
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,166
for something to protect
our heads and eyes.

160
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,750
And, Captain, please recover
your medical supplies

161
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,208
food and water rations.

162
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,917
Well, the medical supplies
are all right.

163
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,834
Food and water?

164
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:37,792
The replicator--

165
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:40,792
damaged beyond repair.

166
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:44,041
Surely you have
emergency supplies.

167
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,500
This isn't a starship.

168
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,000
I have to choose
what I carry.

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,375
Are you telling me
there's no water?

170
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,083
Scanning.

171
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,875
The vessel reads as an unmanned
sublight freighter.

172
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,000
Origin?

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,709
Indeterminate.

174
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:30,125
Propulsion appears to employ
a gaseous-core fission reactor

175
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,667
but it is not functioning.

176
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,500
The radiation levels from
that ship are off the scale.

177
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,875
Could that be leakage
from their engines?
No, sir.

178
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,291
Engine reactor elements
appear to have been inactive

179
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,250
for approximately 300 years.

180
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,083
The vessel is carrying
various unstable waste products.

181
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,250
You mean it's
a garbage scow.

182
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,500
Precisely.

183
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,667
Mr. Worf, open
a hailing frequency.

184
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:55,000
Chairman Songi, this
is Commander Riker

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,166
on board
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

186
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,709
Yes, Commander.

187
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,625
It appears you have inherited
someone else's problem--

188
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,125
an old waste vessel

189
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,000
caught by your planet's
gravitational pull.

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Have your people
begun to suffer

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,542
from radiation sickness?

192
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,417
Not yet, but some areas

193
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:13,250
are already detecting
dangerous levels.

194
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,542
We'll do our best
to get it out of here

195
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:15,917
as quickly as possible.

196
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,291
Thank you, Commander.

197
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,291
We're going to push that
barge into the Gamelan sun.

198
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:25,667
Sir, the Maltasion asteroid belt
lies between here and the sun.

199
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,542
Then we'll take
it in ourselves.
We'll use our deflectors

200
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,625
to clear a path
through the asteroids.

201
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,417
LA FORGE:
I don't like the
idea of getting close
enough to that barge

202
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:33,875
to tow it.
The radiation levels are
so high, we'd be risking

203
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,500
the contamination
of the entire crew.

204
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,917
Do you have a better idea,
Geordi?

205
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,709
We could send
a construction
module over

206
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:41,208
to attach
thrusters to it.

207
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,000
Then we could direct it
through the asteroid belt

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,417
from a safe distance.

209
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,000
Commander, a message

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,041
from the mining
settlement on Pentarus V.

211
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,834
The shuttlecraft
carrying Captain Picard

212
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,125
has not yet arrived.

213
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,458
They left here
at 0800 hours.

214
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,583
They have asked

215
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,458
if we are beginning
a search.

216
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,917
Tell them we have
an emergency situation.

217
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:03,583
We will begin a search
as soon as we've completed that.

218
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,166
WORF:
Aye, sir.

219
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,333
Mr. La Forge, prepare to launch
the construction module.

220
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,417
I'd like to get
this over with

221
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:11,291
as fast as possible.

222
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,542
Any luck with the tricorder,
Ensign?

223
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:20,750
I think so, sir.

224
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,375
The scanning range
may be a bit limited

225
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,875
but it's better
than nothing.

226
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,875
These were on board, Captain.
They're working.

227
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,458
Excellent.

228
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,000
Our communicators
may not be able
to get a signal

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,542
through this strong
a magnetic field.

230
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:38,417
I'm fashioning an arrow.

231
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:43,000
If a search party
finds the wreckage

232
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,083
they'll know that we've
headed for those mountains.

233
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,166
Are you crazy?

234
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,375
They're too far away.

235
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,500
We'll never make it.

236
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,208
We can't survive
in this sun.

237
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:59,166
Where there's mountains,
there's shelter.

238
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,250
You've got no right
to make the decisions.

239
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,542
I'm the Captain
of this ship.

240
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,000
If you want to
get out of this

241
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,875
I suggest you listen
to Captain Picard.

242
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,000
He's the one who's going
to keep us alive.

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,166
Thank you, Ensign.
That's enough.

244
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,375
Captain Dirgo,
you're an able pilot.

245
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,125
I welcome your input.

246
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,333
Do you feel that there
is an alternative

247
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,500
we're overlooking?

248
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,083
No.

249
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,709
Very well.

250
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:37,875
I suggest a steady
pace, not a brisk one.

251
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,750
We need to ration
our energy.

252
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,458
Try breathing
through your nose.

253
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,250
That way, it will help
to prevent dehydration.

254
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,625
I'll lead.

255
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,917
Captain Dirgo, will you
bring up the rear?

256
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:47,166
And you were worried
about how tough the Captain is?

257
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:24,417
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

258
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,083
Did you find water?

259
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,667
No, not yet.

260
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,500
What are you doing
with that?

261
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,250
Mr. Crusher?

262
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm not sure, sir.

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,834
(<i> coughing</i> )

264
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,625
It's an energy reading.

265
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,458
Energy reading?
What kind?

266
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,458
Low frequency EM.

267
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,709
It's been getting stronger

268
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,500
the closer we get
to those mountains.

269
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,417
What are you saying?
There's something over there?

270
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,000
Waiting for us?

271
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,792
I'm not sure what it is.

272
00:15:55,792 --> 00:16:00,333
It just keeps registering
as a repeating energy pattern.

273
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,000
Ensign, are
you suggesting

274
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,375
that this energy is not
naturally occurring?

275
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,291
These readings
could be indicative

276
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,000
of some electromagnetic
properties in the rocks

277
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,125
but I don't think so.

278
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,709
A life-form?

279
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,750
It's possible.

280
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,041
The pattern
is fairly organized.

281
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,208
Well, we can't go back.

282
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,709
We can't stay here.

283
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:32,542
We've got to keep going
for those mountains...

284
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:35,709
no matter what
is waiting for us.

285
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,917
DIRGO:
There has to be water
in here.

286
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:20,166
Aren't caves
formed by water?

287
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,291
PICARD:
Not necessarily.

288
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,750
This could be created
by volcanic activity--

289
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,208
lava flow--
these walls are dry.

290
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,000
Mr. Crusher, do you have
any moisture reading?

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,959
No, sir.

292
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,417
But that EM reading--

293
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,417
the pattern's changed.

294
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,625
The frequency's
peaking a lot higher.

295
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,333
(<i> clattering thump</i> )

296
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,458
You have water!

297
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,125
I wouldn't hide water.

298
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,834
That's called<i> dresci.</i>

299
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,834
It's from my planet.

300
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,750
It's alcohol.

301
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,083
It's medicinal.

302
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,583
It's for emergencies.

303
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,291
I was going to share
it with you.

304
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,750
This wouldn't
quench your thirst.

305
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,792
It would make it worse.

306
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,875
Well, I'll take my chances.

307
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,250
I'm not going to let
you waste this.

308
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,417
This is more valuable
to us as a coolant

309
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:13,625
a disinfectant.

310
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,208
It's mine.
Mr. Crusher,

311
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,291
stow that
with the medical supplies.

312
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,667
Keep your eye on it.

313
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,458
All right, we're going
to explore the cave.

314
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,709
Mr. Crusher, look out
for any signs of water

315
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,000
no matter how faint.

316
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,291
Captain Dirgo,
will you lead the way?

317
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,125
We're projecting
that the bulk of the radiation

318
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,875
will affect
three small island groups.

319
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,333
Fortunately, they're
very sparsely populated.

320
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,500
We'll begin
replicating hyronalin now

321
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,250
and be ready to transport it to
them, if it becomes necessary.

322
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,041
Please coordinate with all the
medical personnel on the planet.

323
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,500
Beverly.

324
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,834
We've contacted
the nearest Starbase

325
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,583
for a search vessel.

326
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,417
I'm afraid
the closest one

327
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,709
is almost a week away.

328
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:17,709
I see.

329
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:19,583
Thank you.

330
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,208
But we have asked
the mining settlement

331
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,458
to send any vessels
they might have.

332
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,625
You know, there
are many reasons

333
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,834
why the shuttlecraft
may have been delayed.

334
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:35,917
Deanna, thank you,
but I'm all right.

335
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:39,291
And right now,
I have work to do.

336
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,041
Commander, the miners report

337
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,125
they have very few
operable shuttlecraft.

338
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,166
They want to know when we
will be joining the search.

339
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,250
Tell them to stand by.

340
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,250
If this works,
we'll be on our way.

341
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,667
Aye, sir.

342
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,375
Thrusters are attached
and ready, Commander.

343
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,875
Initiate prefire sequence.

344
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,083
Prefire sequence
transmitted.

345
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,208
Thrusters to standby.

346
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,375
Fire thrusters.

347
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,041
Gradual acceleration
to 40% power.

348
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,458
LA FORGE:
We've lost one module.

349
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,166
Correcting thrust vectors
to compensate.

350
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,709
Structural integrity
of the barge

351
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:18,792
has been compromised.

352
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,417
Disintegration
is continuing.

353
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,166
Shut down thrusters.

354
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,625
Ensign, take us to 1,000 meters
ahead of the barge and hold.

355
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,917
External radiation
levels increasing, sir.

356
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,625
Coming into position

Mr. Data, I'll
need a projection

370
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:59,375
Mr. Worf, contact
the mining settlement.

371
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:03,417
Tell them we won't be joining
the search for a while.

Yes.

381
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,709
There has to be a way
to deactivate it, sir.

382
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,750
We can, with our phasers.

383
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,333
Mr. Dirgo, I think

384
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,959
it would be wiser...

385
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,625

Your right leg
is broken.

400
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,709
You have a fracture
in your left arm

401
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:19,500
and you took a blow to the head.

402
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,834
But we're getting the bleeding
under control.

403
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,709
Well done.

404
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:26,667

405
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:30,750

00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,667
to get my breath.

407
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:35,667
Will you tell him the truth?

408
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,709
What truth?

409
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,875
He's bleeding inside.

410
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,375
I've seen it before.

411
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,834
He's never going to survive.

412

what you're talking about.

413
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,458
You're wasting your time.

414
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,959
Will you save
that<i> dresci</i> for us?

415
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:53,959
Mr. Dirgo,
I would appreciate it

416
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,875
if you didn't bury me
before I'm gone.

417
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,000
The trouble is
he could be right.

418
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,333
No, he's not, sir.

419
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,959
You're going to be fine.

420
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:24,083
Wesley, you are going to have
to keep a... a rein on Dirgo.

421
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:27,208
He's willful, stubborn.
That's dangerous.

422
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,750
You'll handle him, sir.

423
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,625
Wesley,
listen to me.

424
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:35,166
I have no feeling
in my right leg.

425
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,959
My vision is blurred.

426
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:43,375
I'm going to get worse,
not better.

427
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:46,500
I'm not going to be able
to help you.

428
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,667
No, you are going to have to
stand up to Dirgo on your own.

429
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,291
Yes, sir.

430
00:24:56,291 --> 00:25:00,333

Mr. Data, at our current speed,
how long will it take us

446
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,625
51 Minutes, 14 seconds, sir.

447
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,959
There's going to be
a lot of casualties

448
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,709
if we can't get there
any faster.

449
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:49,834
Mr. La Forge, how much more can
we get out of that tractor beam?

450
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:51,041

Let's see if we can establish
a new upper limit.

453
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:58,041
Yes, sir. Data, monitor the
shearing effect on the beam.

454
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,542

One-half impulse.

464
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,500
Geordi, you've got
to stabilize that tractor beam.

465
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,166
I can't divert any more power
to the shields.

466

We're already hitting

when we move towards the water.

483
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:54,875

must act like... a sentry

to manipulate the frequency

496
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:37,208
maybe I can control it.

497
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:41,000
Now, the sentry first appeared
when you used your phaser.

498
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,375
That means it could respond
to heat or collinated energy...

499
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:44,625
If you're right

500
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,625
we can use a phaser
to lure it away.

501
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,917
Hold on. We need to know
what we're dealing with

502
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:51,083

No, enough talking,
enough thinking.

503
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,500
It's time to do something.

504
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,000
I'll start firing.

505
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,125
When it comes, you
fire and draw it away.

506
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,333
Dirgo, I can't.
Put your phaser
on automatic

507
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:01,291
leave it on that ledge
and take cover.

508
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,417
And what makes you think
it's going to go for my phaser

509
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:05,959
and not for yours?
Because I'll be firing
on the lowest setting.

510
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,417
You use maximum.

511
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:08,709
There is no evidence
that it responds differently

512
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:10,375
to higher settings.

513
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,375
We have to figure
out our options
before we just...

514
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,208
While we are doing that,
your Captain is dying.

515
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:18,959
Wounds like that,

517
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:28,208

00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,500
of the auxiliary
reactors

534
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,000
but it should still give us
the power we need.

535
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,375
Proceed, Mr. La Forge.

536
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,041
Increasing to three
quarters impulse.

537
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:01,333
Shearing force is
at 103 metric tons.

538
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,625
Tractor beam is stable.

539
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,250
Full impulse.

540
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,792
Tractor beam is holding.

541
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:13,834
Warning. Lethal radiation
exposure in 30 seconds.

542
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:16,583
We are within visual range
of the asteroid belt.

543
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,250
On screen.

544
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:20,959
Warning.

545
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:24,875
Lethal radiation exposure
in 15 seconds.

546
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:27,458
Prepare to cut
the barge loose.

547
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:31,959
Warning. Lethal radiation
exposure in ten seconds.

548
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:34,041
We have cleared
the asteroids, sir.

549
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,542
Let it go.

550
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:50,875
Cold.

551
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:58,542
When the sun went down,
the temperature really dropped.

552
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,625
This should help.

553
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:07,083
Oh, good.

554
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,000
Thank you.

555
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,417
(<i> labored breathing</i> )

556
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:15,875
I'm not much good
to you, Wesley.

557
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,166
Sir...

558
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:21,000
Dirgo is dead.

559
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,583
I should have tried harder
to stop him, but he...

560
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,875
(<i> breathing quiets</i> )

561
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:30,000
Captain?

562
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,542
Captain Picard?

563
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,417
Sir, stay with me.

564
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:39,625
I'm trying.

565
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:44,834
Sir...

566
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:51,709
Do you remember when we took
the shuttlecraft together

567
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,750
to Starbase 515?

568
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,375
I was dreading it.

569
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,375
Six hours alone with you?

570
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,875
But it didn't turn out
the way that I thought.

571
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:12,291
You opened up to me.

572
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,583
I... I kind of
got to know you.

573
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:19,166
Wesley, it's my fault
that you're here.

574
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,250
I shouldn't have asked you.

575
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,041
Sir, I'm honored
that you wanted me along.

576
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:25,625
I was selfish.

577
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:29,375
I thought I...
wouldn't see you again.

578
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,291
I'm sorry.

579
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,250
Sir

580
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:40,125
in the past three years,
I've lived more

581
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:43,291
than most people do
in a lifetime.

582
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:52,417
I think I'm very lucky,
no matter what happens.

583
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:58,417
How many people get to serve
with Jean-Luc Picard?

584
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,458
Sir...

585
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,041
You don't know this...

586
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:15,083
no one knows this,
because I've never told anyone.

587
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:22,792
All of the things
that I've worked for--

588
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:28,375
school, my science projects...

589
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:31,583
getting into the Academy...

590
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:38,875
I've done it all because
I want you to be proud of me.

591
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,583
If there is one thing
that I've learned from you

592
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:54,792
it's that you don't quit,
and I'm not going to quit now.

593
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,250
I've seen you think yourself

594
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,208
out of worse
situations than this

595
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:01,291
and I'm going to think us
out of this.

596
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,792
You're not going to die.

597
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:12,792
I'm not going to let you die.

598
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:16,333
I'll get to the water

599
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:20,959
and I'll keep you alive
until they find us.

600
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:23,375
I promise.

601
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,000
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

602
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,083
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is returning</i>
<i>to the last known location</i>

603
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,166
<i>of the missing shuttlecraft.</i>

604
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,458
Are you certain?

605
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,166
It is definitely debris.

606
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:45,166
The primary material is duranium

607
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:48,250
with smaller proportions
of sonodamite and ermanium.

608
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,333
Most shuttlecraft hulls
are made of duranium.

609
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,542
Then, they're gone.

610
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,000
Not necessarily, Doctor.

611
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,542
There is far too
little debris

612
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:56,291
to account for an
entire shuttlecraft.

613
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,375
So what is it?
You know, Dirgo had

614
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:00,000
his maneuvering thrusters
rigged a funny way.

615
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,125
Claimed it was
more efficient.

616
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,500
If one of them blew

617
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,083
it might have left debris
that looks like this.

618
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:05,792
If only one
of his thrusters was out

619
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,667
he still could have
set down somewhere.

620
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:11,792
The only Class-M planets in the
system are Pentarus II and V.

621
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:14,125
Both of which have been
thoroughly searched
by the miners.

622
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,500
Then we'll search them again.

623
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,625
Sir, there are
also four moons

624
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:20,041
in the Pentarus system
that could support life.

625
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,500
Have the miners searched them?

626
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,959
Not yet, sir.

627
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:25,750
Which one is closest
to the debris coordinates?

628
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,083
Lambda Paz, one of the moons
of Pentarus III.

629
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,959
Set a course, Ensign.

Ensign, where are we?

636
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,834
We crashed, sir.

637
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:13,542
We're in a cave.

638
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:16,041
Need water.

639
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:21,500
Sir, we don't have
any water.

640
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,458
Don't you remember?

641
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,333
We tried to get
to the fountain

642
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,375
and Captain Dirgo...

643
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:33,458
Yes... I remember.

644
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:36,542
I think I'm onto something.

645
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:39,083
I've analyzed
the sentry's energy patterns.

646
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:40,500
Wesley

647
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,166
I may not make it.

648
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,583
I've taken
the transponder element

649
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:46,834
from my communicator

650
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,166
and I've used it
to modify my tricorder.

651
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,750
No. No, Wesley...

652
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,959
I think I can use it
to interrupt

653
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,041
the sentry's electrical pattern.

654
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,041
Listen...

655
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,458
Stop it, maybe slow it down.

656
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,291
Listen to me.

657
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,458
Yes, sir.

658
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:05,917
There's so much
I wanted to tell you.

659
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
The Academy...

660
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,333
there's someone...

661
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:17,750
someone who meant
a great deal to me.

662
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:23,041
He's been there for...
oh, forever.

663
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:26,709
Someone you
must get to know.

664
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:29,083
His name is Boothby.

665
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:34,000
Now, you tell him
that you and I were friends.

666
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,458
Now, when I was there, he...
he helped me.

667
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:42,291
Listen to him.

668
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:43,959
What does he teach?

669
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:47,333
He's the groundskeeper.

670
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:50,625
He's one of the wisest men
I ever knew.

671
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:58,542
Oh, I envy you,
Wesley Crusher.

672
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:08,291
You're just at the beginning
of the adventure.

673
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,750
Go on.

674
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,500
Get the water, stay alive.

675
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,709
They'll find you.

676
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:35,542
I'll be back soon.

677
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,792
Of course.

678
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:50,750
Wesley.

679
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:59,875
You remember...

680
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:05,583
I was always proud of you.

00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:57,458
Yes.

693
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,709
Oh, Mom.

694
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,000
Wesley, thank God.

695
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:17,250
I'm so happy to see you.

696
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:21,667
You're okay.

697
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:22,959
Come on.

698
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:26,542
How did you find us?

699
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:28,166
We found the wreckage

700
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,542
and the arrow which
indicated your direction.

701
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:32,583
We'll take Wesley
by stretcher, as well.

702
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:35,375
No. I can walk.

703
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,250
Doctor?

704
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:44,750
We're taking you back
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

705
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,125
We've stabilized
your vital signs.

706
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,792
All right,
let's go now.

707
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:51,583
One moment.

708
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,959
Mr. Crusher?

709
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,250
Yes, sir?

710
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:59,417
What are you doing
in such a filthy uniform?

711
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:05,917
You don't look
so ship-shape yourself, sir.

712
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:15,291
Wesley, you will be missed.
