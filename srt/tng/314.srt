1
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:39,834
Captain, we have arrived
at Tanuga IV.

2
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,083
The away team has completed
its survey of Dr. Apgar's work

3
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,583
and is ready to return
to the ship.

4
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:46,875
Good.

5
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,625
Oh, please... and feel free

6
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:56,959
to examine the work
of the other students, too.

7
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,500
Hmm...

8
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:05,208
Ensign Williams'
striking style

9
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,875
is heavily influenced

10
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:09,041
by geometric
constructivism.

11
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,792
Lieutenant Wright has
effectively fused

12
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:21,250
the incongruities
of the surrealists

13
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,709
with the irrationality
of Dadaism.

14
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:36,875
Interesting.

15
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:37,834
Oh.

16
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,750
Thank you.

17
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,917
In what way?

18
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,750
While suggesting
the free treatment of form

19
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:47,250
usually attributed to fauvism

20
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:52,125
this quite inappropriately
attempts to juxtapose

21
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,375
the disparate
cubistic styles of
Picasso and Leger.

22
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:59,500
In addition, the use of color
suggests a haphazard melange

23
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:01,041
of clashing styles.

24
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,792
Furthermore,
the unsettling
overtones

25
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:04,166
of proto-Vulcan
influences...

26
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,208
Thank you... Mr. Data.

27
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,333
You are welcome, sir.

28
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,750
If I can be of
further assistance...

29
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,583
<i>No...</i> thank you.

00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,500

00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,542
Welcome back,
Mr. La Forge.

38
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,917
Thank you, sir.

39
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,792
Where's Commander Riker?

40
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,667
He's still down
on the station, sir.

41
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,875
Dr. Apgar wanted
to have a word with him.

42
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,000
Any problems?

43
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:51,250
Not with the scientific part
of the mission, no, sir.

44
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,000
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

45
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,875
I'm ready to leave now.

46
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sure Commander Riker
will be able

47
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,083
to explain
everything, Captain.

48
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,875
O'BRIEN:
Stand by, Commander.

49
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:01,208
Engaging transport.

53
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,208
I have a power drain.

54
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,625
Transporter Room.

55
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,542
Is Commander Riker aboard?

56
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:25,375
O'BRIEN:
Not yet, Captain. I'm having
trouble clearing the signal.

57
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,000
Transporter Room to Bridge.

58
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,208
He's aboard.

59
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:42,917
Why do you sound
so surprised, Mr. O'Brien?

60
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,834
Well, for a moment,
we weren't sure

61
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,667
you left the space
station in time.

62
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,250
In time for what?

63
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,583
It just exploded, sir.

64
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:28,125
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

65
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:32,375
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

66
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

67
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:38,166
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

68

69
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:47,375

70
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,667
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

71
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,417
<i>Commander Riker has informed me</i>

72
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,333
<i>that Dr. Apgar was the only one</i>
<i>aboard the space station</i>

73
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,166
<i>when it exploded.</i>

74
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:59,542
<i>We remain in orbit</i>
<i>investigating the accident.</i>

75
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,792
I've gone through
the whole system, Captain.

76
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:05,166
I can't find any malfunction
in the transporter

77
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,667
or nothing that would cause
an explosion like that.

78
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,875
Why was there
a power drain
before transport?

79
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,041
I don't know, sir.

80
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,834
I shall want an
answer to that.

81
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,542
I'm sure the
Tanugans will, too.

82
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,834
Yes, sir.

83
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,583
Captain, the radiation
and debris

84
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,709
are consistent with an overload
of the station's reactor core.

85
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,834
Were there
any indications

86
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,250
of reactor
core problems

87
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,500
while you were
on the station?

88
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,458
No, sir.

89
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,375
Number One?

90
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,917
Mr. La Forge indicated

91
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,583
that this was not
an entirely routine mission.

92
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,959
It's a long story, sir

93
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,750
but I'm sure it doesn't have
anything to do

94
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:40,709
with this accident.

95
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,500
(<i> communications beep</i> )

96
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:45,583
Captain, Chief Investigator Krag
of the Tanugan security force

97
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,458
requests permission
to beam aboard.

98
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,125
Granted. Will you
escort him to the
Bridge, Mr. Worf?

99
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,375
WORF:
Aye, sir.

100
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:57,125
Perhaps you had better tell me
as much as possible

101
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,166
prior to his arrival,
Number One.

102
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,375
(<i> sighing</i> )

103
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,583
I'm Lieutenant Worf,
head of ship's security.

104
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,417
I will take you to the Captain.

105
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,500
Chief Investigator,

106
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,834
welcome to
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

107
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,458
I'm Captain Picard.

108
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,458
This is my
First Officer

109
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,375
Commander
William Riker.

110
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:38,917
Commander Riker, I am here
to take you into custody.

111
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,041
Custody? On what charge?

112
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,875
Suspicion of murder.

113
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:45,000
Murder? Now, wait a minute.
You can't come on...

114
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,458
Chief Investigator...

115
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,667
we are perfectly willing
to cooperate with you...

116
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:49,917
Then release the prisoner

117
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,000
for transportation
to the planet.

118
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,125
Let's continue this
discussion in private.

119
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,125
Number One, you
have the Bridge.

120
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,333
Just what is the evidence
against my officer?

121
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,917
Two witnesses have come forward

122
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,375
to describe Commander Riker's
threats against Dr. Apgar.

123
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:34,500
Threats?

124
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:35,667
I'm aware there was

125
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:37,500
a private conversation
between them.

126
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:40,250
Apparently, it was much more
than just a private conversation

127
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,792
but he will be given a chance
to prove his innocence.

128
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:47,291
Investigator, in our system
of jurisprudence,

129
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,375
a man is innocent
until proved guilty.

130
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:53,709
In ours, he is guilty
until he is proved innocent,

131
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,166
and you are under
our jurisdiction.

132
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,583
If I understand Federation
regulations on this matter,

133
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,125
and I just happened
to look them up...

134
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,750
I am aware of Federation
regulations, sir,

135
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,083
and if you investigate
them further

136
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,208
you will find
the Captain decides

137
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,083
if extradition
is warranted.

138
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,709
Are you saying it is not?

139
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,000
I am saying
if there is sufficient cause

140
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,417
to warrant a trial,

141
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,000
I will release my officer
into your custody.

142
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,834
Would you say that you are close
to your First Officer, Captain?

143
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,542
That question
is irrelevant here.

144
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,834
Really, Captain,
you cannot believe that.

145
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,875
How can I expect
a fair and impartial decision?

146
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,834
I must protect the
rights of my officer.

147
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,208
I can appreciate that,

148
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,834
but you will do it
on the planet, not here.

149
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,500
After all, what if you
were suddenly to decide

150
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,500
to leave this star system?

151
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:50,875
You have my word
as a Starfleet officer

152
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,291
that I will not.

153
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,834
Unacceptable.

154
00:09:55,875 --> 00:10:00,000
Captain, you will turn him over
to me for interrogation now.

155
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,166
Interrogate him here.

156
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:08,834
We must re-create step by step,
moment by moment,

157
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,417
all the events

158
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,125
leading to the explosion.

159
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,583
We will require access
to all the witnesses

160
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:18,375
as well as the data
from the lab's ground computers.

161
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,750
It would be impossible
to accomplish here.

162
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:23,375
Perhaps not.

163
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,709
Mr. Data, will you report

164
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,875
to my ready room?

165
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:26,959
DATA: Aye, sir.

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We may be able to assist you

167
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,291
in re-creating these events.

168
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:37,166
Commander Data, this is
Chief Inspector Krag.

169
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,458
Commander, by
taking testimony

170
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,959
from the away team

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,875
and from witnesses provided
by the Investigator,

172
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:46,417
would it be possible
to program the holodeck

173
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,792
to re-create what happened
on the science station?

174
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:52,875
It would require construction
and design specifications

175
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:55,041
full orthographic
representations

176
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,792
of the Krieger equipment

177
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,625
as well as visual
representations

178
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,083
and voice analyses
of the persons involved,

179
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,250
but it is possible.

180
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,458
Very well.

181
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,291
Arrangements will be
made to provide you

182
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,458
with all available
information.

183
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,458
I shall return shortly
with our witnesses.

184
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,917
Commander, will you escort
Investigator Krag

185
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,834
to Transporter Room Three?

186
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,208
Ensign Crusher,
Mr. La Forge...

187
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,125
we are going
to re-create the
research station

188
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,750
here on the holodeck.

189
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:44,250
I want you to work
with Commander Data
on the preparations.

190
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:48,125
In addition,
Commander La Forge
and Commander Riker,

191
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,542
I want you to
give the computer

192
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,208
detailed depositions
of everything you saw,

193
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,625
everything you heard
while you were on board.

194
00:11:54,667 --> 00:12:00,125
Counselor, I want
you to assist me
during this inquiry.

195
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:07,250
My decision about
the extradition will be based

196
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:12,041
on the evidence presented
during these re-creations.

197
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,709
Captain...

198
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:19,792
May I have a word with you?

199
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:22,166
Under the circumstances,
Number One,

200
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,208
I think that would be
inappropriate.

201
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,583
DATA:
<i>Second Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43611.6:</i>

211
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,625
(<i> door begins closing</i> )

212
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,792
Is there anything
you'd like to say

213
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,500
before we begin,
Number One?

214
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,083
Just this.

215
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,166
I'm not a murderer.

216
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,625
I went to the
Tanugan lab

217
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:39,083
as an official
representative
of Starfleet.

218
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,792
I acted accordingly.

219
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:44,000
I was there to evaluate
Dr. Apgar's progress

220
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,333
in the development

221
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,291
of a Krieger-wave
converter.

222
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,208
That's all I was
interested in.

223
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,417
Computer...

224
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,834
(<i> beeping</i> )

225
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,458
...load deposition program

226
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,083
Riker One.

227
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,500
Run the simulation.

228
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,250
Dr. Apgar?

229
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,792
I'm Commander
William Riker.

230
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,917
Lieutenant Commander
Geordi La Forge.

231
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,625
My assistant, Tayna.

232
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:15,667
Well, let's get on
with it, shall we?

233
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,917
Let's not be in
such a hurry, dear.

234
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,000
Perhaps our guest

235
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,500
would care for
some refreshments?

236
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,375
My wife, Manua.

237
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:25,166
RIKER:
A pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Apgar.

238
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,917
If you're prepared to start,
so are we.

239
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,083
Of course,
I'm prepared.

240
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,750
All right. Why
don't you give me

241
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,500
an overview of
your research

242
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,208
while Mr. La Forge
and your assistant

243
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,333
take a look at the
experimental data.

244
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,625
Fine, whatever.

245
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,959
I must say, Commander, I
resent this early arrival.

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,500
Starfleet will get
its converter.

247
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:44,583
I've had a few
setbacks, that's all.

248
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,041
We're not here to
pressure you, Doctor.

249
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,875
We just want an update
on your progress.

250
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,166
Tayna, show the
Commander's assistant

251
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,750
whatever he wants to
see. Give him full
access to our records.

252
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,000
TAYNA:
Yes, Doctor.

253
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,458
If you'll
come with me.

254
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,333
Our lambda
field generator

255
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,000
is on the planet
since it requires

256
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,709
a minimum
of 5,000 kilometers

257
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,250
for the field
to collimate.

258
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,959
Really, darling,
you're being rude.

259
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,625
After all,
Commander Riker is willing

260
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,625
to sit through all your prattle
about Krieger waves.

261
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,500
Let's have a drink, Commander,

262
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,083
and we'll hear
all about Krieger waves.

263
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,417
To your success, Doctor.

264
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,875
Mm-hmm.

265
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:29,542
And the rewards
that come with it.

266
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,041
Riker, what is Starfleet
doing here anyway?

267
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,750
My delivery wasn't scheduled
for another three months.

268
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:38,125
Well, we were in this sector
on another mission,

269
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,500
and since you had already
contacted Starfleet

270
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:41,959
about additional dicosilium,

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,834
it seemed like
a good opportunity.

272
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,208
How interesting.

273
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,583
Tell us about
this other mission.

274
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,375
It was just a study
of a proto-star cloud.

275
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:51,583
The<i> Enterprise</i>
will be back tomorrow.

276
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,000
The<i> Enterprise</i> 
just left you here?

277
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,667
We didn't want
to inconvenience you.

278
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,625
We've made arrangements
for quarters on the planet.

279
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,875
Oh, I won't hear
of such a thing.

280
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,792
Commander, I insist you
and Mr. La Forge stay with us.

281
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:04,208
I hardly think...

282
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,250
I know that you would prefer
to be left alone

283
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,709
with your very
important work

284
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,458
but I, for one,
am glad for the company.

285
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,959
Good.

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,458
I must apologize

287
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,542
for my husband's lack
of social graces.

288
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,250
He may be one

289
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,750
of the great scientific minds
in the galaxy, but...

290
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:27,542
he does come up a bit short
in other areas.

291
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:32,625
KRAG:
Wait a moment.

292
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:34,875
Stop.

293
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:36,667
Computer,
freeze program.

294
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,917
KRAG:
Then it's your testimony

295
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,500
that it was
Mrs. Apgar's idea

296
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,083
for you to spend the night
aboard the space station?

297
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,959
It's my testimony
and it's the truth.

298
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,959
Resume program.

299
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,000
Our guest quarters
aren't luxurious,

300
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,709
but I've tried
to make this room
warm and inviting.

301
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,500
I'll be very
comfortable, thank you.

302
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,792
Good night.

303
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:06,375
The environmental
controls are over here.

304
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,083
I'm sure I'll find
everything I need.

305
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,959
And the door shuts
by touching this panel.

306
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,625
Mrs. Apgar...

307
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:17,667
This is my sanctuary.

308
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,417
Privacy is very important

309
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,166
on a small station.

310
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:27,291
I'm left alone here,
often for hours.

311
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,834
It's late.

312
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,458
I am tired.

313
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,291
Are you still tired,
Commander?

314
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,542
RIKER:
Ma'am, excuse me.

315
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,917
I really think
that you ought to leave.

316
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,792
I knew I'd find you
with him.

317
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:45,166
Did you think I didn't notice
how you looked at him?

318
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,375
I'm not the fool
you take me for.

319
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,625
RIKER:
Doctor!

320
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,959
(<i> groaning</i> )

321
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,291
Doctor, believe me.

322
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,291
This has been
a terrible mistake.

323
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,333
You won't get away with this.

324
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,333
I'll see to it.

325
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,208
I swear I
will, Riker.

326
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,917
Freeze program.

327
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,542
I didn't
see Dr. Apgar

328
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,375
until the
following morning

329
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,333
when he asked
to see me alone.

330
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,542
Commander La Forge
returned to the
<i>Enterprise.</i>

331
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,125
Resume program.

332
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,625
I suppose if I make
a formal complaint,

333
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,750
your report on my work
won't be very good.

334
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:24,667
Doctor, this is going to have
no impact on my report.

335
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:26,959
It was a misunderstanding
of the worst kind.

336
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,333
We could straighten
the entire thing out

337
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,709
if you would ask
Mrs. Apgar to join us.

338
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,041
My wife and
my assistant

339
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,291
have transported
down to the planet.

340
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,750
What are you going
to put in your
report, Riker?

341
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,166
That there is
no justification

342
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,667
for all the
extra dicosilium
I've requested?

343
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:44,792
That is why they sent
you early, isn't it?

344
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,583
Doctor, I...

345
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,917
NEL:
I can explain
why I needed it.

346
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,625
They have no idea
what my problems are.

347
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,083
There are
explanations for...

348
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,208
I don't need
explanations.

349
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,625
Then we have nothing further
to say to each other.

350
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:02,250
I'll tell my Captain
to expect your grievance.

351
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,208
Do that.

352
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,041
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

353
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,250
I'm ready to leave now.

354
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,583
O'BRIEN:
Stand by, Commander.

355
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,041
Engaging transport.

356
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,041
Freeze program.

357
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,417
Then I returned
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

358
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,208
And you have nothing further
to add, Commander?

359
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,417
Nothing about firing a phaser?

360
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:30,000
I never fired a phaser
on the science station.

361
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, that's odd... very odd.

362
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,208
Captain Picard, is it not true

363
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,834
that your sensors
detected an energy drain

364
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,291
just as Commander Riker
began transport?

365
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,625
That's correct.

366
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,583
KRAG:
Have you been able
to explain it?

367
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,083
PICARD:
Not to my knowledge.

368
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,750
We have.

369
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,542
Our readings are
quite clear about it.

370
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,166
Information retrieved
from the lab's ground computers

371
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,625
indicate that a focused
energy pulse was fired

372
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,750
just as Commander Riker
began transport.

373
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:06,834
Furthermore, by analyzing
the angle and trajectory,

374
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,792
we have determined that
it came from the very spot

375
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,166
Commander Riker was standing.

376
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:22,125
So then, will you allow me
to show you my re-creation

377
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,125
of the end of this story?

378
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,834
A speculation,
if you will.

379
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,125
Computer...

380
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,959
run hypothetical Krag one.

381
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,875
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

382
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,625
I'm ready to leave now.

383
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,333
O'BRIEN:
Stand by, Commander.

384
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,750
Engaging transport.

385
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,875
KRAG:
Freeze program.

386
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:53,000
Three seconds later,
the space station exploded.

387
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,291
LA FORGE:
The Tanugans are right.

388
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,125
Something<i> was</i> fired
at the reactor core

389
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,250
just before transport.

390
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,667
The energy signature

391
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,834
would seem to indicate
a phaser-like blast.

392
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,667
Well, it<i> wasn't</i> 
the Commander's phaser.

393
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,709
It couldn't have been.

394
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,125
There's another answer.

395
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,166
We're just not seeing it.

396
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,667
Was there anything
else in the lab

397
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:26,291
capable of creating this
kind of energy discharge?

398
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,583
Not that I saw.

399
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,208
Besides, how do you
account for the fact

400
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,625
that it came from
Commander Riker's
exact position?

401
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,000
Damn it, I should've
stayed with him.

402
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,083
(<i> beeping</i> )

403
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,625
Commander.

404
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,500
Sensors indicate
a radiation burst

405
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:39,709
on deck 39
outside cargo bay 12.

406
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,083
Source?

407
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,333
Unknown, sir.

408
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,834
Computer, identify
type of radiation.

409
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:49,166
Emission is not consistent
with any known radiation.

410
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,291
It is subsiding, sir.

411
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,000
WESLEY:
What kind of radiation
could do this?

412
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,750
Make any sense to you?

413
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,625
I don't recognize it.

414
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,750
Not even the main deflector
puts out that kind of spillage.

415
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,250
Where would it
be coming from?

416
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,458
I don't know, Wes,
but whatever it is

417
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,583
it's capable of putting
a hole in solid duranium.

418
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,750
In a sense,

419
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,917
we have already
met Mrs. Apgar,

420
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:35,500
so we shall dispense
with introductions.

421
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:37,375
PICARD:
Mrs. Apgar,

422
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:39,500
you understand the
purpose of this hearing?

423
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:42,041
TROI:
We understand

424
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,834
how difficult
this will be for you.

425
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,333
If you need a recess,

426
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,750
please don't
hesitate to ask.

427
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:49,083
PICARD:
Would you like

428
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,208
to make a statement
before we begin?

429
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,917
No.

430
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:55,417
I just know he did it.

431
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,417
He killed my husband.

432
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,125
Computer,

433
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:04,083
load Manua
Simulation One.

434
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,792
Run program.

435
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,875
If you greet them
with such a long face

436
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,208
they're going to assume

437
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,583
something<i> is</i> wrong
with the experiment.

438
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,667
I just need time,
a little more time.

439
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,750
I'm certain they'll give you
all the time you need

440
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:20,792
if you just show
a little charm.

441
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,667
You do that so much better

442
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:25,000
than I do.

443
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:31,542
Manua, someday I'll be able
to reward you

444
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,208
for all
your patience.

445
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,333
I'll get you everything
you ever dreamed of.

446
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,709
I have all the reward I need.

447
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,291
Now go on.

448
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,875
I'll be right in.

449
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:45,667
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

450
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,000
RIKER:
Dr. Apgar?

451
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,917
I'm Commander
William Riker.

452
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,542
Lieutenant Commander
Geordi La Forge.

453
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,458
My assistant, Tayna.

454
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,291
Well, let's get on
with it, shall we?

455
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,917
Don't be in such a hurry, dear.

456
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:00,333
Perhaps our guests would
like some refreshment?

457
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,583
My wife, Manua.

458
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,709
A pleasure
to meet you, Manua.

459
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,000
NEL:
I'm anxious
to get started.

460
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,542
If you wish.

461
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,417
I must say, I resent your
early arrival, Commander.

462
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,709
I have much work to do.

463
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,542
Doctor, I'll
do everything
in my power

464
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,291
to make this as painless
as possible for both of us.

465
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,458
Do you assist
your husband
in his work?

466
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,583
Oh, dear, no,
I'm no scientist.

467
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,583
No, neither am I.

468
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,667
But I find this all fascinating,
don't you?

469
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,333
Mr. La Forge, why
don't you take a look

470
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,709
at the Doctor's
experimental data.

471
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,083
Later you can
give me an overview.

472
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,458
Fine, whatever.

473
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,375
Starfleet will get its
Krieger-wave converter.

474
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:36,583
These things take time.

475
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,333
I've had a few setbacks,
that's all.

476
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,834
RIKER:
Doctor, I'm not trying to put
any pressure on you.

477
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:43,750
I'm sure my report will
only underscore the need

478
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:46,250
for continued support
of your research.

479
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,834
Mm-hmm.

480
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,375
Tayna,

481
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,000
I'll call up
the records.

482
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,083
Show the Commander's
assistant whatever
he wants to see.

483
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,291
Yes, Doctor. If
you'll come with me.

484
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,750
Our field generator
is on the planet

485
00:24:57,792 --> 00:25:00,917
since it requires a minimum
of 5,000 kilometers

486
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,208
for the field
to collimate.

487
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,750
Darling, let Tayna
take care of that.

488
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,250
I'm sure
Commander Riker

489
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,625
wants to hear how
close you are to
a breakthrough.

490
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:10,959
I'll pour the two
of you a drink

491
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,041
and you can talk all
about Krieger waves.

492
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:24,834
Commander.

493
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,458
To success.

494
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,959
Success.

495
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:34,625
Well, in a way, I suppose
it's good that you're early.

496
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,125
Manua's right.

497
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,458
It gives me a
chance to show you

498
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,375
the progress
we've been making.

499
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:40,792
I would appreciate it

500
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,583
if Commander La Forge and I
could stay here

501
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,375
until the<i> Enterprise</i> returns.

502
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,917
It's a little inconvenient.

503
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:51,542
It would help
to accelerate the process.

504
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:58,583
Well, if you wish, Commander.

505
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:01,166
Now, uh...

506
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:04,375
where shall I start?

507
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:07,333
Well, first of all,

508
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,166
you should know
that I am very close

509
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:14,000
to being able to collimate
a Krieger field.

510
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,375
Our guest quarters

511
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:19,709
are quite modest.

512
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,375
RIKER:
Very charming.

513
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:22,917
It has your touch.

514
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:25,542
The station is small
and we don't often have guests,

515
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,750
so I use this
as my sanctuary.

516
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:30,667
Who do you need
sanctuary from?

517
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:34,250
The environmental
controls are here.

518
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:36,417
(<i> sighing</i> )

519
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,000
Commander, please...

520
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,959
it's late and I'm tired.

521
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,792
A man more interested
in Krieger waves

522
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,083
than a lovely woman like you...

523
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,375
How is that possible?

524
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:46,875
My husband is one
of the greatest minds

525
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,083
in the galaxy,

526
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,625
and we love each other
very much.

527
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:51,792
Please, don't.

528
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:53,458
RIKER:
You must be very lonely...

529
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,083
a princess
in a very high tower.

530
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,166
Please, my husband
will be looking for me.

531
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,000
Your sanctuary, remember?

532
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:01,458
Commander, don't, please!

533
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,458
She's lying.

534
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,000
That never happened.

535
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,542
Freeze program.

536
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,083
Please...

537
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,041
Captain, you know I would
never act like that.

538
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,000
Commander Riker...

539
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:13,542
This isn't me.

540
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,458
I wasn't the one
who closed the door.

541
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,875
I didn't proposition her

542
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:19,125
and I certainly didn't
try to rape her.

543
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:22,375
Why are you
doing this?

544
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:26,208
It's exactly what happened.

545
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,792
Will, come on, sit down.

546
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,166
Resume program.

547
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,291
Please...

548
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,083
I knew you'd try this, Riker.

549
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:53,500
Do you think I didn't notice
how you looked at her?

550
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,959
I'm not the fool
you take me for.

551
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:02,917
You won't get
away with this.

552
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:04,250
Your career is over.

553
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,667
I'll see to it,
I swear I will, Riker.

554
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:08,041
If you report this,

555
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:09,959
you'll be making
a terrible mistake, Doctor.

556
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,959
A terrible mistake.

557
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:21,583
Freeze program.

558
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,792
Your career was safe.

559
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:27,333
He was a scientist.

560
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,000
In another day,
some fascinating bit

561
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,375
of technical trivia
would have distracted him.

562
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,083
He would have forgotten
about you

563
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,959
and his complaint
to Starfleet.

564
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:38,792
(<i> softly</i> ):
Excuse me.

565
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:45,375
We'll, um...

566
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:48,083
we'll take a short recess.

567
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,417
Why would she lie like that?

568
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,875
She was lying.

569
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:03,333
You could tell.

570
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:08,375
Will, I didn't sense
any deception from her.

571
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:10,417
Then you think
that I would...?

572
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,166
No! No, of course not.

573
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,834
I<i> know</i> you.

574
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,333
You don't have
to convince me
of anything.

575
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:17,667
We can't both be
telling the truth.

576
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:22,583
It is the truth as
each of you remembers it.

577
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:27,208
But her version
puts a noose around my neck.

578
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,709
This is healing
beautifully.

579
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,333
I think you can
work on strengthening
those muscles again.

580
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,125
WORF:
Security to Dr. Crusher.

581
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,792
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

582
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:40,250
Evacuate. Repeat, evacuate.

583
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:42,709
Radiation emissions
are indicated in Sick Bay.

584
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,959
(<i> alarm continues</i> )

585
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:58,583
This is definitely
the same radiation

586
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:00,166
that penetrated deck 39.

587
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,583
Highly focused, very powerful,
but of unknown origin.

588
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,750
If this should happen
near the engine core

589
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:06,667
or the antimatter
containment tanks,

590
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,333
we'll be in
big trouble, Captain.

591
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,667
Do you have any theories?

592
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,333
Captain, Data's
noticed something

593
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,458
that's too strange
to be a coincidence.

594
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,750
The two radiation events
aboard the<i> Enterprise</i>

595
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:19,458
occurred five hours, 20 minutes
and three seconds apart.

596
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,250
The science station exploded
yesterday

597
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:23,583
at almost four times
that interval.

598
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,834
WESLEY:
There's a .0014-second variance

599
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:29,291
we haven't been able
to explain yet.

600
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:30,834
So you're saying
there's a connection

601
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:33,000
between the radiation bursts
and the explosion.

602
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,959
We do not have the evidence
to support that conclusion

603
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,250
at this time, Commander.

604
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:38,458
BEVERLY:
If they're right,

605
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,959
we should be able to
predict the next event.

606
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,750
We're expecting it
in just over five hours.

607
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,250
Well, take every precaution

608
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:46,458
to protect the ship's
vital areas.

609
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,875
If we haven't identified
the source

610
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:51,959
before the next time interval,
we'll leave orbit.

611
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,792
If you perceive
any further danger,

612
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:55,834
advise me immediately.

613
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:00,083
We'll figure it out
for you, Commander.

614
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:16,417
After the... the fight,
Dr. Apgar came to find me.

615
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:20,083
He was very upset.

616
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,959
And he told you what happened?

617
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yes, he told me everything
that happened.

618
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,792
Based on Tayna's deposition,

619
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:30,917
we have re-created the incident
in Commander Riker's quarters

620
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,041
as Dr. Apgar described it
to her.

621
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,250
Computer...

622
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:36,417
Inspector, Inspector,
this is hearsay.

623
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:39,083
She wasn't a witness
to this incident.

624
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:41,792
But Dr. Apgar is dead.

625
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:45,417
Her statement is admissible
according to Tanugan law

626
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:48,375
and I<i> insist</i> you
consider it.

627
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,458
Well... we'll watch
this "evidence"

628
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,959
and we'll weigh it
accordingly.

629
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,959
Computer, run Tayna
Simulation Three.

630
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:11,041
I knew I'd find
the two of you together.

631
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,834
Do you think
I didn't notice

632
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,959
how you were looking
at each other?

633
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,792
I'm not the fool

634
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,166
you take me for.

635
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:24,625
I'm going to report this,
Riker.

636
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,875
You can count on that.

637
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:28,667
You're a dead man, Apgar.

638
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:30,583
A dead man.

639
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,625
Freeze program.

640
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:35,792
And then Dr. Apgar
came to find you?

641
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,583
Yes.

642
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:40,291
Run Tayna Simulation Four.

643
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,625
I want you to take Manua

644
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,417
and beam down to
Tanuga immediately.

645
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:48,792
But, Doctor,
if he threatened you

646
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,000
you shouldn't stay.

647
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,542
I'm not leaving him
here alone.

648
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,041
He's capable
of anything.

649
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,583
I've got to
protect our work.

650
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,166
I'll contact
the authorities.

651
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,333
No... I'll take
care of that.

652
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,709
Doctor, be careful.

653
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,166
It'll be all right.

654
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,625
Go on.

655
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:12,000
KRAG:
Freeze program.

656
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,792
Then what happened?

657
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:15,834
I left the station
with Manua.

658
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:19,667
The next day, when I heard
the station had exploded,

659
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:21,792
I knew what had happened.

660
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,917
He'd killed Dr. Apgar.

661
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:26,208
KRAG:
Thank you.

662
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,875
You are excused.

663
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:31,333
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

664
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:35,959
Captain, I have
established motive,
method and opportunity.

665
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,417
In any court
in the Federation

666
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,875
that is sufficient

667
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,125
to warrant the extradition
of the accused.

668
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:46,417
I await your
decision forthwith.

669
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,500
I don't see
any alternative.

670
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:00,500
Do you?

671
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:02,333
We both know Will's innocent.

672
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,000
Of course he's innocent!

673
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:07,041
But as a Starfleet Captain,
I can't allow myself the luxury

674
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:12,041
of yielding
to personal feelings.

675
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,625
The evidence warrants a trial.

676
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,125
I'll have to allow extradition.

677
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:20,709
Do you think
there's enough evidence

678
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,667
to prove his innocence?

679
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:25,917
No.

680
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:28,166
DATA:
Captain, I believe we have found

681
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,875
the source of the radiation.

682
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:31,458
Can you join us on the Bridge?

683
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,792
Acknowledged.

684
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:41,000
As you know, Captain,
we are looking for
a phenomenon

685
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,291
that reoccurs
every five hours

686
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,834
20 minutes and
three seconds.

687
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,583
The interval between
the radiation bursts.

688
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,291
We have found one
such phenomenon

689
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,583
on the
planet surface.

690
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,000
It's the field generator
that Apgar used

691
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,333
during his research.

692
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,625
When it's fully charged

693
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,375
it automatically emits
an energy pulse

694
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:55,875
and then takes five hours

695
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:58,667
20 minutes and three seconds
to recharge itself.

696
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:01,208
It must have been left on
after the explosion at the lab.

697
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,875
But why would
a generator

698
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:05,417
be affecting the
<i>Enterprise</i> in this way?

699
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:06,750
It should not be.

700
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:09,291
It is a harmless
lambda field generator.

701
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,250
LA FORGE:
But we knew that somehow
it was related

702
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:12,792
to our radiation bursts,

703
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:14,500
and then the pieces
just started falling together.

704
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:16,583
We now know
what is causing the bursts

705
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,583
and why the science station
exploded, sir.

706
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:21,709
And we also know
who killed Dr. Apgar.

707
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,875
Chief Inspector,
we've watched these events

708
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,333
replayed over and over again

709
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,667
and... I am impressed

710
00:35:47,709 --> 00:35:51,959
and admittedly dismayed

711
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,500
by the body of evidence
against Commander Riker.

712
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:59,667
But isn't it remarkable
that with all the witnesses,

713
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,542
all the different points
of view

714
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:05,000
of the events
aboard the space station,

715
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:08,333
we haven't seen
what really happened?

716
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,625
I do not understand.

717
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:14,333
Allow me, with the help
of Mr. La Forge, to explain.

718
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,875
Computer, load
Manua Program One,

719
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:22,875
time index 14-4-1.

720
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,875
Play program.

721
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,291
Fine, whatever.

722
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,667
Starfleet will get
its Krieger-wave converter.

723
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:29,917
These things take time.

724
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,667
I've had a few setbacks,
that's all.

725
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:33,208
PICARD:
Freeze.

726
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,709
Mrs. Apgar, this
is taken from
your deposition.

727
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,834
It would seem to suggest
that your husband

728
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:39,542
had failed to create
Krieger waves.

729
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:41,667
Yes, but he was very close
to a breakthrough.

730
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:43,083
He said he
needed more time.

731
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:45,375
He was upset
by our early arrival.

732
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:47,375
Where in fact, I maintain

733
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:50,834
that he had already made
that breakthrough

734
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,000
and that he was lying to us.

735
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,250
On what basis?

736
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:55,667
LA FORGE:
For the last several hours

737
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:57,917
the<i> Enterprise</i>
has been experiencing

738
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,792
unusual radiation bursts.

739
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:02,291
We've identified them
as Krieger waves.

740
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,500
Krieger waves?

741
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:04,583
But that's impossible.

742
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:05,792
From where?

743
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:08,291
From right here
inside the holodeck.

744
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,625
PICARD:
We have re-created
your science lab

745
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,291
in every conceivable detail.

746
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:15,709
Essentially, what was
in the original lab is here.

747
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,583
Including
the Krieger-wave converter

748
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:20,750
that Dr. Apgar claimed didn't
work, except it does work.

749
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:23,000
Your field generator
down on the planet surface

750
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,250
has been sending out
harmless energy charges,

751
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:31,667
which this facsimile has been
converting into Krieger waves.

752
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,625
But the holodeck can't
create anything dangerous.

753
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:35,875
Well, it didn't.

754
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:39,333
When you get down to basics,
the converter is nothing more

755
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:42,709
than a complex series of mirrors
and reflective coils.

756
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,750
The energy from
the field generator

757
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:46,709
down on the planet

758
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,542
simply reflects off of elements
in the converter,

759
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:52,417
which turns it into
highly focused Krieger waves.

760
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,250
And those same
waves have been

761
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:56,208
randomly striking
different areas
of our ship

762
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,875
as we orbit
the planet

763
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:00,917
and our angle to the
generator changes.

764
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:04,166
Why would Dr. Apgar lie
about his success?

765
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:09,166
Computer, run
Manua Program One,
time index 14-3-8.

766
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:14,917
Manua, someday
I'll be able
to reward you

767
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,792
for all your patience.

768
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:20,417
I'll get you everything
you ever dreamed of.

769
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:23,000
I have all the reward I need.

770
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,959
PICARD:
Freeze program.

771
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,083
Computer, run Riker Program Two,
time index 16-1-0.

772
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,417
To your success, Doctor.

773
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:40,250
And the rewards
that come with it.

774
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,375
PICARD:
Freeze.

775
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:44,375
I never said that.

776
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,500
Nevertheless,
it seems clear
that your husband

777
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:49,542
was motivated to
earn the rewards
that pleased you,

778
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,166
Mrs. Apgar.

779
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:52,291
What's wrong with that?

780
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,959
TROI:
Well, he
wouldn't have

781
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,959
earned great profits from
his dealings with Starfleet.

782
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,709
We were only interested
in a new power source.

783
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,959
But if he could turn this
into a weapon,

784
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,458
it would be worth a lot

785
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,625
to the Romulans, the Ferengi,
and a few others.

786
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,667
Now, Dr. Apgar had been ordering
extra dicosilium for months.

787
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:10,291
That's a pretty good indication

788
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,750
that he was trying to create
larger reflective coils.

789
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:14,667
And when the away team
arrived early,

790
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,000
he must have been worried

791
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,208
that Starfleet
was becoming suspicious.

792
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,417
He needed more time
to finish his work.

793
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:25,125
Apgar said that
in each of the three versions.

794
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:28,417
No doubt he was afraid

795
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:31,542
that Commander Riker
might learn the truth

796
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:34,875
and cut off his support
prematurely.

797
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,750
Discovering
Commander Riker
with his wife

798
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,083
didn't help matters.

799
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:46,709
I submit he
decided to murder
Commander Riker.

800
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,542
Ridiculous.

801
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:51,208
Is it?

802
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,417
Computer, run Tayna
Program Four,

803
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:58,750
time index 18-1-4.

804
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,291
I'll contact the authorities.

805
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:07,917
No... I'll take
care of that.

806
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:12,083
PICARD:
Freeze.

807
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:14,917
Tayna, what exactly
is Apgar doing here?

808
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:18,041
Activating the generator
on the planet.

809
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,041
Now, why would he do that?

810
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:23,542
Maybe he was going to work
on the converter.

811
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:24,834
I don't know.

812
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,959
Maybe he was already
thinking ahead

813
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,083
to his next confrontation
with Commander Riker.

814
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:32,875
Computer, play
Riker Program Four,

815
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:36,792
time index 24-1.

816
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,750
What are you going
to put in your
report, Riker?

817
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,542
That there's
no justification

818
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,083
for all the
extra dicosilium
I've requested?

819
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,417
That is why they sent
you early, isn't it?

820
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,709
Doctor...

821
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,250
I can explain
why I needed it.

822
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:51,458
They have no idea
what my problems are.

823
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,000
There are
explanations for...

824
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,500
I don't need explanations.

825
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:56,333
PICARD:
Freeze.

826
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:58,959
To Apgar, this must have
seemed as though

827
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,333
Commander Riker
were confirming
his worst fears,

828
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,959
and I believe it was now

829
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,208
that he finally decided
to kill him.

830
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,208
KRAG:
You forget, Picard.

831
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,208
We know that the energy pulse
which blew up the reactor

832
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,000
originated from
Commander Riker's position

833
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,542
not Dr. Apgar's.

834
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:19,083
Hmm... We are hypothesizing

835
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:21,417
that Dr. Apgar energized
the converter

836
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,000
at the moment
of Commander
Riker's beam-out,

837
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,542
hoping to make his
death look like a
transporter accident,

838
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:28,250
but something
went wrong.

839
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:31,000
The energy pulse hit
the transporter beam

840
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:32,417
and reflected back

841
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:35,250
to the reactor,
which caused
the explosion.

842
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:39,333
An interesting hypothesis,
but impossible to prove.

843
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:41,542
LA FORGE:
Not really.

844
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,291
We know that field generator
on the planet

845
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:45,625
has been repeating a discharge
ever since the explosion.

846
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:46,917
The intervals are like clockwork

847
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:49,375
<i>except</i> the explosion occurred

848
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:53,417
.0014 seconds
after the initial discharge.

849
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:55,208
Now, the only explanation
for that variance

850
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,834
is the time it would take
the energy pulse to bounce back

851
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,250
from the transporter
beam to the reactor.

852
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,458
We've arranged a demonstration
to illustrate.

853
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,000
Mr. La Forge, I think
it's about time, isn't it?

854
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:08,166
Computer, load program
La Forge One.

855
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:11,792
Coordinate auto-engage
time sequence.

856
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,625
The next discharge
from the field generator

857
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:16,041
is scheduled to
occur in just
a few moments.

858
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,792
Now, we've aligned
the holodeck program

859
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,375
to re-create the final events

860
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:21,542
as Commander Riker
described them,

861
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,709
only this time, our facsimile
will automatically process

862
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,709
the energy charge
from the planet

863
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,709
and reflect it just
as the original converter did

864
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,291
before the explosion.

865
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:35,709
If we're correct,
we'll know it instantly.

866
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,709
COMPUTER:
Auto-engage time sequence
synchronized.

867
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,542
Then we have
nothing further

868
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,458
to say to each other.

869
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,083
I'll tell my Captain
to expect your grievance.

870
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,375
Do that.

871
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:50,375
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

872
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:52,208
I'm ready to leave now.

873
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,709
O'BRIEN:
Stand by, Commander.

874
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,583
Engaging transport.

875
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,709
Dr. Apgar killed himself

876
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,125
during his attempt
to kill Commander Riker.

877
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,834
Based on this new evidence,
I withdraw my request

878
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:38,125
for Commander Riker's
extradition.

879
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:40,500
Commander...

880
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:42,792
my apologies.

881
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:54,333
Number One, have we
any further business

882
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,917
in the Tanuga system?

883
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:57,375
None that I know of.

884
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:58,750
I'd be more than willing
to put it behind me.

885
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:00,250
Then perhaps
you would do me the pleasure

886
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:01,834
of getting this ship underway.

887
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,000
With pleasure, sir.

888
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,291
Ensign Crusher,

889
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:07,959
set course
for Emila II,
warp three.

890
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,417
Course laid in, sir.

891
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:11,208
Engage.
