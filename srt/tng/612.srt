1
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:04,000
It was then
I began to suspect

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:07,166
that your brother did not die
by his own hand.

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:10,959
That he was, in fact...
murdered.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,542
Murdered?

5
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,166
Good Lord.

6
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:18,542
But, Holmes, the vial of poison
found in his hand.

7
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,917
That was the first clue,
Watson.

8
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:24,125
The vial contained strychnine,
which, as you well know,

9
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,834
induces violent
muscular spasms.

10
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,834
It is difficult
to imagine

11
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,375
that someone in the throes
of so gruesome a death

12
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:33,542
could have held onto
so delicate a container

13
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,750
without shattering it.

14
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:36,542
You don't mean...

15
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,250
Exactly!

16
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:41,875
The vial was placed in his hand
after he died.

17
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:46,166
Then what was
the cause of death?

18
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,875
The cigar,
of course.

19
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,458
(<i> coughing</i> ):
Cigar?

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,083
Upon closer
investigation

21
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:54,125
of the room in which
your brother was found,

22
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,166
I discovered a fresh burn mark
on the carpet.

23
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,375
Further analysis
of the ash revealed

24
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:01,875
that the cigar was laced
with strychnine.

25
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:03,875
This is
utter nonsense.

26
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:06,333
What about
the suicide note?

27
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,834
It was written in
my dear brother's own hand.

28
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,375
With practice,

29
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,625
handwriting
can be forged.

30
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,083
It takes
a trained eye

31
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,375
to notice
certain discrepancies.

32
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:22,542
For example,
whether someone is right...

33
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,750
or left-handed.

34
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,792
Your brother
was right-handed.

35
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,834
The alleged suicide note
was written

36
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,625
by a left-handed
individual

37
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,166
such as yourself.

38
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:37,709
Uh, Data,
it's in his right hand.

39
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,583
(<i> chuckling</i> )

40
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,041
Curious.

41
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,417
There seems to be a problem

42
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,583
with the holodeck's
spatial orientation systems.

43
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:52,458
London's
greatest detective, huh?

44
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:56,083
Freeze program.

45
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,333
La Forge to Barclay.

46
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,041
BARCLAY: Barclay here.

47
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,542
Reg, something went wrong with
the holodeck program again.

48
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,792
Oh, I'm sorry.

49
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:04,041
I'll look into it right away.

50
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,375
Thanks, Reg.

51
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,709
We should get back
to engineering, Data.

52
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:15,667
Computer, end program
and save.

53
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,083
Whoa.
Whoa, Reg.

54
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,375
I'm sorry,
Commander.

55
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,750
I'm just on my way
to the holodeck.

56
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:25,875
Sherlock Holmes Program 3A
has demonstrated

57
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:27,625
some very curious
anomalies.

58
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,458
There must have
been a glitch in
the matrix diodes

59
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
but I'll track it down, don't
worry.

60
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,875
Thanks, Reg.
See you later.

61
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:45,041
Computer, run a diagnostic
on all Sherlock Holmes files.

62
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,750
Display any anomalous
programming sequences.

63
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,917
COMPUTER:
Diagnostic complete.

64
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,417
All files conform
to specified parameters

65
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,083
except those contained
in protected memory.

66
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,333
Protected memory?

67
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,125
All right,
display those sequences.

68
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:04,792
Computer, unlock this sequence
and run the program.

69
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,208
Who are you?

70
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,667
Professor
James Moriarty.

71
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,166
Moriarty,
oh.

72
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,375
That's Sherlock Holmes'
archenemy.

73
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,917
Are you left or right-handed?

74
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,291
Left-handed.

75
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,041
Would you mind very much
telling me...

76
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,625
No problem there.

77
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:34,375
Where is
Captain Picard?

78
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:36,750
Is he still captain
of this vessel?

79
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:38,125
How would...?

80
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,291
How do you know
the captain?

81
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,500
You don't know anything
about what happened, do you?

82
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:48,083
I have been stored in memory
for God knows how long

83
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,041
and no one has given me
a second thought.

84
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,208
You know!

85
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,375
You know
what you are!

86
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,125
A holodeck
character?

87
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,333
A fictional man?

88
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:02,500
Yes, yes, I know all about
your marvelous inventions.

89
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,291
I was created
as a plaything

90
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,000
so that your
Commander Data

91
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,083
could masquerade
as Sherlock Holmes

92
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,333
but they made me
too well

93
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,500
and I became more
than a character in a story.

94
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:16,166
I became
self-aware.

95
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,250
I am alive.

96
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,792
That's not possible.

97
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,458
But here I am.

98
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,208
Tell me, has a way
been found to allow me

99
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,291
to leave the confines
of this holodeck world?

100
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,333
Leave the holodeck?
No, of course not.

101
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,834
You can only
exist in here.

102
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,792
Damn you, Picard.

103
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:39,625
He promised me
something would be done.

104
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:42,375
I should have realized
he would have said anything

105
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,333
to get me to release
my hostage.

106
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,792
Hostage?

107
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:48,625
How long have I been
locked away?

108
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,750
Uh, well,
it looks...

109
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:54,208
looks like about,
uh... four years.

110
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,000
It seemed longer.

111
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,291
What are you
talking about?

112
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,625
You can't possibly
have been aware

113
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,000
of the passage
of time.

114
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,208
But I was.

115
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,583
Brief terrifying periods
of consciousness

116
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,959
disembodied

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,500
without substance.

118
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't see how that
could be possible.

119
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,959
Maybe there was
a fragmentation

120
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,917
of the protected
memory circuits.

121
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,250
Call it
what you will.

122
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,041
All I know is that

123
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,417
despite Picard's promise,
he's done nothing.

124
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,417
Just left me
to go quietly mad.

125
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,166
He would not have
forgotten his promise.

126
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,750
The captain
would not do that.

127
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,625
I'd like to talk to him.

128
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,208
Well, I-I can ask...

129
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,000
Ask him to meet me

130
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,166
in the sitting room
at Baker Street.

131
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,208
That would be
far more appropriate.

132
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,834
I'll have to store you

133
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,250
in memory again
until I get an answer.

134
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:40,667
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

135
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:44,667
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

136
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,542
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

137
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:50,500
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

138
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:55,083
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

139
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:59,500
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

140
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,208
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46424.1.</i>

141
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,417
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has arrived</i>
<i>at the Detrian System</i>

142
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,834
<i>to observe</i>
<i>a unique</i> celestial event--

143
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,542
<i>the collision of two planets.</i>

144
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,625
Since both planets
are gas giants

145
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,542
neither possesses
a solid surface.

146
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,041
Their atmospheres, however,
will come into contact

147
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,917
in approximately
17 hours, nine minutes.

148
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,250
If their collision
causes

149
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,208
a self-sustaining
fusion reaction,

150
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,792
this is what
we are likely to see--

151
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,750
the birth
of a new star.

152
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,625
The<i> Enterprise</i> 
will hold position

153
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:28,959
until the gravitational
instability subsides

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,917
and we can get in
for a closer look.

155
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,709
Now I want triple redundancy
on all of the sensor arrays.

156
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,667
We'll probably never
get another chance

157
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:37,291
to see something like this.

158
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,709
I don't want
to miss anything, okay?

159
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,333
Commander, you'll never

160
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,834
believe what happened

161
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,875
while I was working on your

162
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:47,417
program in the holodeck.

163
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,375
Professor Moriarty appeared

164
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:51,625
out of nowhere.

165
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,500
What?

166
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,959
And he wants to talk
to the captain.

167
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,291
Computer, begin
Sherlock Holmes Program 3A

168
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,000
and place us in the drawing room
at 221-B Baker Street.

169
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,000
COMPUTER:
Program complete.

170
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,500
Computer, access
protected memory

171
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:17,709
and run
Moriarty program.

172
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,750
Professor.

173
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,375
It's good
to see you again.

174
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,625
If you'd missed
my company,

175
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,750
I should think you'd have
summoned me before now.

176
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:33,583
I assure you,
we have not forgotten you.

177
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,583
We spent time investigating

178
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,834
how you became
self-aware.

179
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,417
Frankly, it still
remains a mystery.

180
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,500
It is also
irrelevant.

181
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:46,083
What concerns me is finding
a way to leave the holodeck.

182
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,917
We have been wrestling
with that problem, too

183
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,917
unfortunately,
without any success.

184
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,917
But we have turned
our findings over

185
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,667
to Starfleet's most experienced
theoretical scientists.

186
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,667
And what did your finest
minds come up with?

187
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,166
Unfortunately, they have not
arrived at a solution either.

188
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,542
I see.

189
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,250
Professor,
I am concerned

190
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,250
to learn that you experienced
the passage of time

191
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,625
while you were stored

192
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,834
in the computer
memory.

193
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,792
I can assure you

194
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,583
we had no idea
that would be the case.

195
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,333
Enough of this.

196
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,000
I no longer believe
anything you say.

197
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,917
Professor, I understand
your frustration.

198
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,417
Do you really?

199
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:26,083
When this is over,
you will walk out of this room

200
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,041
to the real world
and your own concerns

201
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,750
and leave me here
trapped in a world

202
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,583
I know to be nothing
but illusion.

203
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,417
I cannot bear that.

204
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,417
I must leave.

205
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,834
That is not possible.

206
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,917
You cannot exist
outside this room.

207
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,000
Are you certain
of that?

208
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,667
Computer, exit.

209
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,875
Although objects appear
solid on the holodeck

210
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:58,500
in the real world,
they have no substance.

211
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,291
An object
has no life.

212
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,959
I do.

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,250
Professor, you are
a computer simulation.

214
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,250
I have
consciousness.

215
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,375
Conscious beings
have will.

216
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,875
The mind endows them
with powers

217
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,667
that are not
necessarily understood

218
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,458
even by you.

219
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,333
If my will
is strong enough

220
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,375
perhaps I can exist
outside this room.

221
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:28,959
Perhaps I can walk
into your world right now.

222
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,166
Professor, I ask you
to believe me.

223
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,542
If you step out of that door,
you will cease to exist.

224
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,125
If I am nothing more
than a computer simulation

225
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,417
then very little
will have been lost

226
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,083
but if I am right...

227
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,125
Mind over matter.

228
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,709
<i>Cogito ergo sum.</i>

229
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,291
I think,
therefore I am.

230
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,250
Data to security.

231
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,375
Send two officers
to holodeck three.

232
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,667
How is this
possible?

233
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,333
BARCLAY:
It isn't.

234
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,375
This contradicts everything we
know about holodeck physics.

235
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,000
Then perhaps you don't know
as much as you thought.

236
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,333
Professor, will
you come with me?

237
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,667
I'd like our doctor
to examine you.

238
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,083
Certainly, sir.

239
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,291
Policemen--

240
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,333
I'd recognize them
in any century.

241
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,250
As far as I can
tell, he's real.

242
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,792
He's human.

243
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,458
What else would I be,
dear lady?

244
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,709
His DNA is a little unusual,
but all the major systems

245
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,750
are there and
functioning normally.

246
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,917
As far as I can tell,
there's no evidence

247
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,166
that his molecules
are losing any cohesion.

248
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,750
They seem to be as immutable
as ordinary matter.

249
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:54,333
Well, Professor, my crew
will continue to investigate

250
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:58,667
but, for now, it would seem that
you have accomplished a miracle.

251
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:02,583
The question is,
now that you're here,

252
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,291
what do we do with you?

253
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,333
I ask only that I be allowed
to explore this new world.

254
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,625
Your vessel, for instance--

255
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,375
what sea
does she sail?

256
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,709
Might we go
above deck?

257
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,208
Weather permitting,
of course.

258
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,500
Professor, I think
there are some things

259
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:23,792
of which you
should be made aware.

260
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:25,875
(<i> quiet conversation</i>
<i>and laughter</i> )

261
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,542
My God.

262
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,709
We're adrift
in the heavens.

263
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,875
No, not adrift.

264
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,667
The<i> Enterprise</i> 
is a starship

265
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:42,625
capable of traveling
through space.

266
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,875
Extraordinary.

267
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:50,542
Are we far
from Earth?

268
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,542
What is the range
of this ship?

269
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,542
What means of locomotion
does it use?

270
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:58,417
There's so much
for me to learn.

271
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,625
I hardly know where
to start.

272
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,500
I can give you books
that will help.

273
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,041
Good, good.

274
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,000
I want to start
making plans.

275
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,166
Determine what I'm going
to do with my life.

276
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,875
I hope you will plan on
remaining on board for a while.

277
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,333
There is still much
that we need to understand

278
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,834
about what has
happened to you.

279
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,417
Does it really matter?

280
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,250
The point is I'm here

281
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,375
and I'm eager
to get on with life.

282
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:22,875
Professor,

283
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:25,208
I feel it necessary
to point out

284
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,041
that criminal behavior
is as unacceptable

285
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,500
in the 24th century
as it was in the 19th

286
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:33,333
and very much harder
to get away with.

287
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,667
Don't worry,
Captain.

288
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,041
My past is nothing
but a fiction--

289
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,500
the scribblings of an Englishman
dead now for four centuries.

290
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:43,417
I hope to leave his books
on the shelf, as it were.

291
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,208
If that is so,

292
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,792
then there are opportunities
awaiting you

293
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:52,792
that are beyond anything
you have ever imagined.

294
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:55,500
Your century
may welcome me, but...

295
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,875
What is the matter?

296
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:01,583
In considering
all these vast possibilities

297
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,583
I suddenly feel
very much alone.

298
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:09,041
I am a man out
of time, Captain,

299
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,250
and that isolates me.

300
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:16,917
You have been more gracious
than I ever could have imagined.

301
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,917
I wonder...

302
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,208
May I impose upon
your generosity once again?

303
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,667
There is a woman--

304
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,250
the Countess Regina
Barthalomew.

305
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,291
She was created
as a holodeck character

306
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,792
for one of
Commander Data's programs.

307
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:33,917
She was designed to be
the love of my life.

308
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,250
Could she also

309
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,291
be brought off
the holodeck?

310
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,083
Professor, I ask you
to believe me when I say

311
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,959
that we do not know
how or why

312
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,458
you are able to exist
off the holodeck.

313
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,083
I do.
I do believe you.

314
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,250
According to the laws
of physics, this is impossible.

315
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,583
We would have no idea
how to do it again.

316
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,166
As I understand it,

317
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,500
I was endowed with consciousness
four years ago

318
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,959
when someone said
to the computer

319
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,417
"Create an opponent with
the capacity to outthink Data"

320
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,667
or words to that effect.

321
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:07,083
Could we not make
a similar request

322
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,834
on behalf of the countess?

323
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:12,709
Even if I had reason to believe
that it would be successful

324
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,583
I don't think
that I could sanction it.

325
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:19,000
Please understand,
Professor,

326
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,291
that you are, in essence,
a new life-form--

327
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,125
one that we didn't
intend to create

328
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,917
and that we don't
fully understand.

329
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,458
Now, the moral and ethical
implications

330
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,333
of deliberately creating
another one like you

331
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,709
are overwhelming.

332
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,291
Is it morally
and ethically acceptable

333
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,208
to deny the woman I love

334
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,125
so that you can put
your conscience at ease?

335
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,500
Are you saying that
you will simply dictate

336
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:44,917
how I am to live my life?

337
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,417
I assure you, we will do
everything possible

338
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,959
to make you comfortable.

339
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,500
So long as
I accept the terms

340
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:54,083
under which you dole out
those comforts.

341
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,041
Captain...

342
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,917
I am a powerless man.

343
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:03,917
You hold my future,
my happiness

344
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,500
my very life
in your hands.

345
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,458
Please...

346
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,083
consider my request.

347
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,875
I understand
his frustration.

348
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:15,208
We created him and we created
her to be the woman he loves.

349
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,917
Surely we have some
responsibility to them.

350
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,667
It's very romantic

351
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,959
but until we know just what it
was that walked off the holodeck

352
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,917
I don't think we should be
trying it again.

353
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,291
Even if we decided to do it

354
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,834
there's no guarantee
that we'd be able to.

355
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,959
DATA:
There is also no way
of knowing

356
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,917
if the professor's ability
to exist off the holodeck

357
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,917
is permanent.

358
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:37,250
It may be unwise to consider
creating a second individual

359
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,834
while this uncertainty
exists.

360
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,417
Agreed.

361
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,834
We don't have enough information
about this phenomenon

362
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,709
to act responsibly.

363
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,500
I think we'll hold off on
Professor Moriarty's
request for now

364
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:51,667
but continue with
your investigation.

365
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:52,875
In the meantime,

366
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:55,875
I have to deal
with Professor Moriarty.

367
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,125
I feel we must postpone
action until we learn more.

368
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,291
Yes, you know
all about that.

369
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,500
I stayed in the dungeon
of your computer for years

370
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,750
waiting for you
to learn more.

371
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,709
It wasn't until I took matters
into my own hands

372
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,333
that
something got done.

373
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,667
Professor, I wonder why you
are in so much of a hurry?

374
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,667
Is this woman
involved with you

375
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,291
in some illegal
venture?

376
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,458
Your computer
designed her

377
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,125
to be a person
of impeccable integrity.

378
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,166
She would never
commit a crime.

379
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,792
You must love her
very much.

380
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,750
The program fashioned her
for me to love.

381
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:38,792
But I must admit,
I would have done so anyway.

382
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,250
She is remarkable.

383
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:45,333
My life has not been the same
since I met her.

384
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,375
I don't simply love her,
Captain.

385
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,500
I adore her.

386
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,583
Then her safety must be
very important to you.

387
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,792
Give us time to determine
what is going on here.

388
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,625
That way we can minimize

389
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,709
the risks in
bringing her to you.

390
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,917
You wouldn't want
to lose her

391
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,166
because we acted
too quickly.

392
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,083
RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard.

393
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,250
Picard here.

394
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,208
Could you join us
on the bridge?

395
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,583
On my way.

396
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,792
RIKER:
There they are, Captain.

397
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:24,375
How long before they begin
to coalesce?

398
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,959
Within the next
five hours, sir.

399
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,458
PICARD:
Mr. Worf,

400
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,208
launch four Class-A probes
towards the planet.

401
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,667
Aye, sir.

402
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,542
(<i> loud beeping</i> )

403
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,959
Mr. Worf?

404
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,208
I-I don't understand.

405
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,959
The controls are not
responding.

406
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,125
Command functions
are being rerouted, sir.

407
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,333
For what reason?

408
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,583
Unknown, sir.

409
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,542
Computer,
route all command functions

410
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,917
to the bridge.

411
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,375
COMPUTER: Command functions
are off-line.

412
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:59,083
Reinitialize them
on my authorization.

413
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,834
COMPUTER: Authorization denied.

414
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,625
Explain.

415
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:06,375
Picard command codes
are no longer valid.

416
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,583
What's happening?

417
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,583
Who's transferred
the voice authorization?

418
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,417
I have.

419
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,041
I'm afraid
I had no choice

420
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,959
but to take control
of your vessel.

421
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,375
If you harm me, sir,
I will not be able to relinquish

422
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,959
voice control
of your vessel.

423
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,333
Professor,
this situation

424
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,208
is more serious
than you realize.

425
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,875
In less than five hours,
those two planets will collide

426
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,125
and a new star
will form.

427
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,041
Unless we move
to a safe distance

428
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,750
this vessel will
be destroyed.

429
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,959
I'm just
a fictional character.

430
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,333
I haven't much
to lose.

431
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,417
But surely, you wish to live
like the rest of us.

432
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,709
Not alone.

433
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,250
Not without the countess.

434
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,792
We've discussed
that.

435
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,083
We are studying means

436
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,917
of bringing her safely
off the holodeck,

437
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,583
but five hours
is not enough time.

438
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,959
I'm not so sure.

439
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,792
A deadline has
a wonderful way

440
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:09,000
of concentrating the mind.

441
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,917
Mr. Data,
will you investigate

442
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,917
the possibility
of complying

443
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,375
with Professor Moriarty's
request?

444
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:16,709
Aye, sir.

445
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,667
In the meantime,

446
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:21,125
we have a few things
to discuss.

447
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,166
Perhaps we should consider
the transporter system.

448
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,875
It uses many of
the same principles
as the holodeck.

449
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,291
Both, for example,
are capable

450
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,083
of converting
energy into matter.

451
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,291
Except the transporter

452
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,709
reconstitutes energy
in a permanent form.

453
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,083
Holodeck matter
doesn't have any cohesion

454
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,250
unless it's inside the grid.

455
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,375
I wonder
what would happen

456
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:47,750
if we tried to beam
a holodeck object off the grid?

457
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:49,583
Nothing
would happen.

458
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,583
A holodeck object
is just a simulation.

459
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,166
There's nothing there
to provide a pattern lock

460
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,291
for the transporter.

461
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,458
However,
if it<i> were</i> possible

462
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,667
to lock onto the object

463
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:01,583
it might rematerialize with
the same molecular cohesion

464
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,834
as conventional matter.

465
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,125
That's a big leap,
Data.

466
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,667
I just don't think

467
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,667
the transporter is going
to accept simulated matter.

468
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:09,291
Unless... unless we
could find a way

469
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,208
to compensate for
the phase variance.

470
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,041
If we could modify
the pattern enhancers

471
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,333
we just might do it.

472
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,917
Well, Professor Moriarty

473
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,500
has agreed not to interfere
with routine ship operations.

474
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,625
So long as he believes that
we are acting in good faith,

475
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,750
then I don't think
we're in immediate danger.

476
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,333
Any progress?

477
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,250
We were just talking
about using the transporter

478
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,792
to beam the countess
off the holodeck,

479
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:30,291
but I don't quite see
how it's going to work.

480
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,375
Well, keep at it.

481
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,542
I have to tell him that we
are making some progress.

482
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,709
Mr. La Forge?

483
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,583
Do you have any idea
how Moriarty

484
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,875
could have gained
control of the ship?

485
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:42,750
Somehow he managed
to override

486
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:45,208
the security lockouts
and rewrite them.

487
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,709
The man is brilliant
in any century.

488
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:53,166
I want you to find some way
to undo what he has done

489
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:57,375
so that we can regain
control of this ship.

490
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,834
Set the pattern enhancers
around whatever object

491
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,166
you wish to transport.

492
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:03,375
I will proceed
to the transporter room

493
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,083
and begin
modifications.

494
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:08,500
Computer, run
Sherlock Holmes program 3A.

495
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:11,709
COMPUTER: That program
is already in use.

496
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,458
Have you come
to see Mr. Holmes

497
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,750
or perhaps
Professor Moriarty?

498
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,250
Neither is in just now.

499
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,792
Um, uh, no, no, I'm not
here to see anyone.

500
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:29,417
I'm... just here
to deliver these.

501
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:34,041
Fine. Just, um...
put them anywhere.

502
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:38,709
Well, actually, I have
to put them right here.

503
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,875
How curious.

504
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:43,542
Why is that?

505
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,333
Well, it has to do with...

506
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:50,375
it is nothing you need
to worry about, Countess.

507
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:54,917
Are you suggesting that it's
beyond my comprehension?

508
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:57,125
It's really
very simple.

509
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,375
I need to enhance
the molecular pattern

510
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:02,125
of this chair
so that the transporter

511
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:06,333
can get a better
lock on the signal.

512
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:11,083
This has to do
with taking James and me

513
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,709
into the real world.

514
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,291
You, you...
you know about that?

515
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,625
I mean, you understand
about the real world?

516
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,208
James has explained it
to me.

517
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,625
It sounds like
a grand adventure.

518
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:26,125
There's nothing I love more
than voyaging in the unknown.

519
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:29,250
Have you ever been
to Africa, Mr.-- um...?

520
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,709
Uh, Barclay,
Lieutenant Reginald Barclay.

521
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,959
No. No, I haven't.

522
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,417
I have.

523
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:38,083
When I was 17, I went on safari
with my uncle.

524
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,875
My mother took
to her bed in terror

525
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:43,166
I'd be bitten
by a tsetse fly

526
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:45,709
but I had
a marvelous time.

527
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,917
I got to wear trousers
the whole time.

528
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:54,166
Oh, it was hard to go back
to a corset, I can tell you.

529
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:57,333
Yes, I'm sure it was.

530
00:24:57,375 --> 00:25:00,417
After that, I never
stopped traveling.

531
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:05,166
Oh, I couldn't bear to be stuck
in one place for very long

532
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:08,417
so you see, I am<i> so</i> looking
forward to this new experience.

533
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:09,834
My...

534
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:13,041
Traveling the stars.

535
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,000
You know
about that?

536
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,625
Y-you, you know
where we are?

537
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,333
Countess, forgive me,
but you just don't sound

538
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:20,959
like a holodeck
character.

539
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,583
That's because she isn't.

540
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,583
James.

541
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:36,000
If you loved a woman
like this, Lieutenant,

542
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:39,458
would you be content to
let her remain a simulation?

543
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,959
You... you gave her
consciousness?

544
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,583
Yes, just as it
was given to me.

545
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,375
Well, I'm not so sure
that that's a good idea.

546
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:50,458
Nonsense. It was
the only thing to do.

547
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,917
Have you tried to take her
off the holodeck yet?

548
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:56,166
No. I'm unwilling to risk
the countess' safety.

549
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:59,000
I want to make sure
nothing will happen to her.

550
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:02,208
We may be closer to freedom
than you think, James.

551
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:08,000
These devices will enhance
our molecular patterns.

552
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,792
They'll help take us
into the real world.

553
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,709
Well, please,
proceed.

554
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,166
Well, we're going to try

555
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,000
to transport this chair
off the holodeck first.

556
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,083
We didn't want to try it
on the countess

557
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:20,792
until we were sure
it would work.

558
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:22,583
How thoughtful.

559
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:25,250
Isn't he thoughtful,
James?

560
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,834
Barclay to Commander Data.

561
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,208
Go ahead,
Lieutenant.

562
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,667
BARCLAY: I'm ready here.

563
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:35,375
Modifications
are complete.

564
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:36,583
DATA: Stand by.

565
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,000
Standing by.

566
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,208
Activating pattern enhancers.

567
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,417
Energizing.

568
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:54,166
I am having difficulty
establishing a pattern lock.

569
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:56,125
Boost the confinement beam,
please.

570
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:02,083
Pattern lock established.

571
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,208
Energizing.

572
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,667
Ooh!

573
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:11,500
Bravo!

574
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:14,291
Do you have the chair,
commander?

575
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:16,917
No.

576
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,333
It lost its cohesion

577
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:20,709
as soon as the transporter cycle
was complete.

578
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

579
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,625
Well, it was a...
a long shot to begin with.

580
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,875
DATA: Agreed,
however, we may be able

581
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:28,417
to learn something
from the attempt.

582
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,458
Computer,
display the transport logs

583
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,458
from the sequence
just completed.

584
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,333
Computer,
what is being displayed here?

585
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,917
Transport log 759.

586
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:46,959
That is the correct log,
however, no information

587
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,291
is being presented.

588
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,583
Well, th-that's
impossible.

589
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:50,750
DATA: It is almost as if

590
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:53,750
our attempt
to transport the chair

591
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,709
never occurred.

592
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,875
You wanted
to see me.

593
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,291
Ah, yes, Captain,
I think I found a way

594
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,667
to reinstate your
vocal authorizations.

595
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:12,166
Give it a try.

596
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,458
Computer,
route all command functions

597
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,792
to this location.

598
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:17,542
COMPUTER: Command functions
are off-line.

599
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:20,417
Reinitialize them
on my authorization.

600
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,333
Please input command codes.

601
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,917
Picard,
Epsilon-seven-nine-three.

602
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,583
COMPUTER:
Command codes verified.

603
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:29,333
That's it.
That should do it.

604
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,500
Wait a minute.
It didn't work.

605
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:35,458
The computer won't release
the command pathways.

606
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:41,333
Geordi.

607
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,709
Why did you do that, Data?

608
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,959
Captain...

609
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,959
I have determined
how Moriarty

610
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,250
was able to leave
the holodeck.

611
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,583
He never did.

612
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,041
Neither
did we.

613
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,917
None of this
is real.

614
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:59,166
It is
a simulation.

615
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:02,083
We are still
on the holodeck.

616
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:13,333
We're still on the holodeck?

617
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,917
How do you know that?

618
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,458
Through deduction,
sir.

619
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,834
Lieutenant Barclay
and I tried to transport

620
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,750
a simulated object
off the holodeck--

621
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,291
something that
has never been attempted.

622
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,417
Since the transporter itself
is a simulation

623
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:27,000
the computer
had no real data

624
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,834
from which to create
the transport logs.

625
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:31,458
Maybe it was just a malfunction
in the transporter.

626
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Then I saw you working
the PADD with your left hand.

627
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,625
Commander La Forge
is right-handed, sir.

628
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,542
A similar malfunction
occurred

629
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:41,000
in the Sherlock Holmes
program I was running

630
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,875
before Moriarty
first appeared.

631
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,625
Mr. Data, if what
you say is true

632
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,917
then this is not
Geordi La Forge.

633
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,250
Are you certain?

634
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,000
Computer,
discontinue program.

635
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,750
Computer, exit.

636
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:13,667
Moriarty appears to have
programmed the holodeck

637
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:15,417
to accept
only his commands.

638
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,000
Picard to bridge.

639
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,333
RIKER: Riker here.

640
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:21,000
Number one,
what is my present location?

641
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,375
Engineering.

642
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,458
Is something wrong, sir?

643
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,625
No.

644
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,959
Thank you.
Picard out.

645
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,875
Our combadges must be
locked into the simulation.

646
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:33,041
If that had been
the real Commander Riker,

647
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,917
he would have given my location
as holodeck three.

648
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:39,917
Mr. La Forge

649
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:42,125
would you excuse us,
please?

650
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,625
Mr. Data,
who is real here?

651
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,458
You and I are real, sir,
as is Lieutenant Barclay.

652
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,208
We entered
the holodeck together

653
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,542
when we first went
to meet Moriarty.

654
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,333
And from that point

655
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:05,583
we have been existing
in a holodeck simulation

656
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,959
created by
Professor Moriarty.

657
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,125
I believe
that is the case, sir.

658
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:13,458
I have just given the
computer my command codes

659
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,542
thinking I would get
control of the ship.

660
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,125
You may have inadvertently given
Professor Moriarty the means

661
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,792
of gaining control
over the real<i> Enterprise.</i>

662
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:24,583
Since Professor Moriarty

663
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,125
never actually
left the holodeck

664
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,583
he may demand
that Commander Riker

665
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,417
help him to do so.

666
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,917
How long until the
planetary collision?

667
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,709
Less than
three hours.

668
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,083
As long as Moriarty
has control of the ship

669
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,875
we are vulnerable.

670
00:31:40,917 --> 00:31:43,333
Somehow...

671
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:47,583
I have to find a way of
giving him what he wants.

672
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,417
Where is
Captain Picard?

673
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,709
And what have you done

674
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,542
with Lieutenant Barclay
and Commander Data?

675
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,917
They're safe...
for now.

676
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:04,583
Release control
of this ship.

677
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:07,125
I'm afraid
I can't do that.

678
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,583
What do you want?

679
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,333
I only want

680
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,291
what you have the luxury
of taking for granted--

681
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,750
Freedom.

682
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:17,125
I want to leave
this holodeck.

683
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,625
I think you know
that's impossible.

684
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:23,208
Your crewmates here
in my little ship in a bottle

685
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,000
seem a bit more optimistic.

686
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,917
Oh?

687
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,625
They attempted to use

688
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,125
your transporter device
to remove

689
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,458
a simulated object
from the holodeck.

690
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,917
If they tried it

691
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:37,375
they must have thought
they were onto something.

692
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:38,959
Their attempt
was futile

693
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,333
because their transporter
was a facsimile.

694
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,125
I expect more from you.

695
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,375
Just because our
transporter is real

696
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:47,333
doesn't mean
it's going to work.

697
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:51,458
I sense a distressing lack
of enthusiasm on your parts.

698
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:55,667
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

699
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:56,834
Sir.

700
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,917
Warp core temperature
is rising.

701
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:00,500
Approaching critical levels.

702
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:06,208
I have nothing to lose,
Commander.

703
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:11,125
Mr. La Forge, start working
on the problem.

704
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:12,500
Aye, sir.

705
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,041
Core temperature dropping.

706
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,375
Computer,
resume program.

707
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:36,375
Hello.

708
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:37,750
Have we met?

709
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,500
Captain
Jean-Luc Picard.

710
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:42,333
Ah! James has told me
all about you.

711
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:45,083
Regina,
Countess Barthalomew.

712
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:49,583
Do sit down.

713
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,917
May I offer you
some tea, Captain?

714
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,667
Thank you, no.

715
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:58,000
I've come here
to prevail

716
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:00,417
on your intelligence
and your insight.

717
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:02,667
But not, apparently,
my humility.

718
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,083
Credit where
credit is due, madam.

719
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,542
I can see you are a woman
not only of breeding

720
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:10,208
but of wit
and sagacity.

721
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:15,125
And you, sir, are a man
of charm... and guile.

722
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:18,250
You remind me
of Viscount Oglethorpe.

723
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:21,834
He was a man
who could bewitch

724
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,625
any woman
who breathed.

725
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:26,709
And do you suspect that
that is my intent?

726
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,041
I cannot be certain
of your intent

727
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,625
but I<i> am</i> certain

728
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,333
you're the kind of man

729
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:35,041
who usually gets
exactly what he wants.

730
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:39,041
What does a woman like you
see in a man like Moriarty?

731
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,125
He is an exciting man,
Captain.

732
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:47,625
He's brilliant...

733
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:50,417
incisive...

734
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,000
He's ruthless.

735
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,750
He has an almost
irresistible appeal.

736
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:00,583
He's also
an arch criminal.

737
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:04,500
Only because he was
written like that.

738
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:06,709
I see him
entirely differently.

739
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,959
Captain, he is<i> not</i> 
a villain.

740
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So it's your desire to leave
the holodeck to be with him.

741
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,250
More than anything.

742
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,583
Can you help us?

743
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,917
Yes, I can.

744
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:24,500
We have learned
that if we uncouple

745
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:27,500
the transporter's
Heisenberg compensators

746
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,166
and allow them
to rescramble randomly

747
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,709
then we can beam

748
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,083
a holodeck object--
or a person--

749
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:37,208
off the grid,
with all of the cohesion

750
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,792
of conventional matter.

751
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:40,083
Oh!

752
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,709
Oh, that's
splendid.

753
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,291
I must tell James.

754
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,583
No, please.

755
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,792
Wait.

756
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:49,208
I have brought you
this information

757
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,750
because I think you are
someone who will listen

758
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:55,041
to a reasonable
proposition.

759
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:57,375
Someone whose mind
is open to compromise.

760
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:59,083
Yes?

761
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,834
My ship is in danger.

762
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:04,333
It is imperative
that I regain
navigational control.

763
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,208
I want you to persuade
Professor Moriarty

764
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,458
to return
the voice command to me

765
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,083
or I will not modify
the transporter.

766
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,583
I see.

767
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:17,208
Now, once I have
regained voice command

768
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,208
I will transport you
from the holodeck.

769
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:23,250
Forgive me, Captain,

770
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:27,083
but that does sound more like
a threat than a compromise.

771
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,333
Countess,
you must understand

772
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:32,709
that I am responsible
for more than 1,000 lives.

773
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:42,125
I will do what I can.

774
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:45,458
LA FORGE:
The gravity well is beginning

775
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,000
to intensify.

776
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,000
Are we far enough away
to keep from being pulled in?

777
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:52,083
(<i> sighs</i> )
It's too soon to tell.

778
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,417
Riker to
Lieutenant Worf.

779
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,667
WORF: Worf here, sir.

780
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,417
How are you doing?

781
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:59,166
There are force fields blocking
our access to the holodeck.

782
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,375
It will take time
to disable them.

783
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:02,792
RIKER: Keep trying.

784
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:04,166
Aye, sir.

785
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,417
Think, my dear.

786
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,000
You're certain he said

787
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:09,583
they had to uncouple the
Heisenberg compensators?

788
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,000
Yes, James.

789
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,291
I'm quite certain,
but he won't do it

790
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,500
unless you return control
of the ship to him.

791
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:19,458
I have them running
around like rats in a maze.

792
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,125
What harm
would there be

793
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,583
in accepting
his proposition?

794
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,709
My dear, you are
as brilliant

795
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,125
as you are beautiful.

796
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:28,375
Nonetheless,

797
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:31,166
there are things
you do not understand.

798
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:34,250
Now, please, you must
let me handle this.

799
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:35,792
Computer, arch.

800
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,625
Moriarty to Commander Riker.

801
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,875
Riker here.

802
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:46,750
Commander Riker,
a pleasure as always.

803
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:48,875
I don't have time for games,
Moriarty.

804
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:51,041
This ship is falling
into a gravity well.

805
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,291
It will be destroyed
within 25 minutes--

806
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,583
holodeck and all.

807
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56,375
Then I'm sure
you'll be motivated

808
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:59,000
to listen to me
very, very carefully.

809
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,667
I want to talk to you

810
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:03,917
about uncoupling
the Heisenberg compensators.

811
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,792
James, when we leave here,
where exactly are we going?

812
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,083
Everywhere, my darling.

813
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,834
There are more worlds
in the heavens

814
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,750
than there are grains
of sand on a shoreline.

815
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,208
Oh, I wish I could
take my books.

816
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,834
I will be so
lost without them.

817
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,417
I'll get you more.
Don't worry.

818
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,166
I promise you, you'll
want for nothing.

819
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:26,959
Riker to Moriarty.

820
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,208
It's time.

821
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:31,375
Yes, Commander.

822
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:32,333
We're ready.

823
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,417
As are we.

824
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,208
Step into the transport area.

825
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,166
We're ready here.

826
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:49,375
Activating pattern enhancers.

827
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:50,583
Energizing.

828
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:01,250
Welcome aboard.

829
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:03,458
(<i> laughing</i> )

830
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,417
May I present Regina,
the Countess Barthalomew.

831
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,166
Countess.

832
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:09,959
Commander.

833
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,583
You'll forgive me if
I skip the formalities

834
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:12,917
considering
the circumstances.

835
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:15,041
Ah, yes,
I expect you want me

836
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,458
to relinquish my hold
on your vessel.

837
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,792
Please.

838
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:21,583
I'm afraid that won't
be possible just yet.

839
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,917
We had an agreement.

840
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,875
And I intend
to honor it.

841
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:27,625
I have no desire to see
your vessel destroyed.

842
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:30,083
Just give me one
of your... shuttlecraft

843
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,333
and allow us
to leave in peace.

844
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,917
We don't have
time for this.

845
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:36,166
You release those command codes
and we'll talk.

846
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,625
I will not
release your vessel

847
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:42,000
until I am looking at it
through a shuttlecraft window.

848
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,208
Everything
has been programmed

849
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,583
to operate
on voice command.

850
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,750
You just tell the computer
where you want to go.

851
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:52,917
Excellent.

852
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:54,750
I suggest you head
for Meles II.

853
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,375
It's the nearest
inhabited planet.

854
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:57,709
The people are friendly.

855
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,291
Where you go from there
is your business.

856
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,792
Please tell your captain

857
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:02,959
I'm sorry I couldn't
say good-bye.

858
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,625
I do wish I could
see his face

859
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:07,083
when he realizes where he's been
the last several hours.

860
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:10,000
Every second we waste puts us
in that much more danger.

861
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,291
Don't worry,
Commander.

862
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,917
You'll soon have
control of your ship.

863
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:14,959
Good-bye, Commander.
Thank you for everything.

864
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,917
Computer,
prepare to depart.

865
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,417
Open shuttle bay doors.

866
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:25,041
(<i> warning klaxon sounds</i> )

867
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:37,667
This is so
beautiful.

868
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:39,291
Indeed, my dear.

869
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,166
It is a wondrous sight--

870
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:44,917
the first of many we
are sure to encounter

871
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,250
in our travels.

872
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:50,125
Computer,

873
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:52,125
interface with
the central computer

874
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,333
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

875
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,458
COMPUTER: Interface complete.

876
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,000
Release command
function lockouts.

877
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:04,041
Authorization: Moriarty,

878
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:07,208
alpha-two-four-one-five-nine.

879
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,792
James?

880
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,041
Yes, my love?

881
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:15,000
Can we go back
to Earth someday?

882
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:17,583
Of course, my dear.

883
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:20,208
Of course.

884
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,250
Computer, store program

885
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:30,041
Picard delta one
in active memory

886
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,542
and discontinue simulation.

887
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:36,667
COMPUTER:
Program stored.

888
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,375
Well, it worked.

889
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,917
They believed they were
off the holodeck.

890
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:47,166
Did Moriarty release
the voice commands, Captain?

891
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,750
Let's find out.

892
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:50,667
Computer, discontinue
holodeck simulation

893
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,208
created by
Professor Moriarty.

894
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,208
Well, so far,
so good.

895
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,375
This should be the holodeck
on the real<i> Enterprise.</i>

896
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:01,917
Picard to bridge.

897
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,875
RIKER:
Captain, are you all right?

898
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:06,041
Yes, we are, Number One.
What is your status?

899
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:07,625
Our systems came
back on line

900
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:08,959
a few minutes ago.

901
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,250
And the planetary collision?

902
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,667
We're pulling back
to a safe distance.

903
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:14,917
We'll join you shortly.

904
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,834
Captain.

905
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,875
Mr. Worf,
everything is all right.

906
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,875
How did you do it, sir?

907
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:32,208
We managed to program the
holodeck inside the holodeck

908
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,083
and used the same ruse
that Moriarty used on us.

909
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:37,625
DATA:
When he was attempting
to contact the real bridge

910
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,750
he was, in fact, speaking
to a simulation.

911
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:42,083
You mean, he never knew he
hadn't left the holodeck?

912
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,792
In fact, the program
is continuing to run

913
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:46,583
even now,
inside that cube.

914
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,542
A miniature holodeck?

915
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:49,959
In a way,
Doctor.

916
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,875
However, there is
no physicality.

917
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:53,250
The program is continuous,

918
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:55,625
but only within
the computer circuitry.

919
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:58,250
As far as Moriarty
and the countess know,

920
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:01,417
they're halfway
to Meles II by now.

921
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:05,166
This enhancement module
contains enough active memory

922
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,208
to provide them
with experiences

923
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,625
for a lifetime.

924
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:10,625
PICARD:
They will live their lives

925
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:12,959
and never know
any difference.

926
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,792
In a sense, you did give
Moriarty what he wanted.

927
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,583
In a sense, but who knows?

928
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,834
Our reality may be
very much like theirs

929
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:24,041
and all this might just be
an elaborate simulation

930
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:29,000
running inside a little device
sitting on someone's table.

931
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,500
Well, we have

932
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,542
a newborn star to study.

933
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:34,875
Mr. Barclay,

934
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:36,959
you will keep
that safe.

935
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,667
Aye, sir.

936
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,917
Computer, end program.
