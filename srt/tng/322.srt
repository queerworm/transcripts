00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:17,875
<i>from the Zibalian trader,</i>
<i>Kivas Fajo.</i>

6
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:21,625
<i>Because pure hytritium</i>

<i>Lieutenant Commander Data</i>

10
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,250
PICARD:
Go ahead, Mr. Data.

11
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,917
This will be the last trip,
sir.

12
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,375
The remaining cases of hytritium
are now being loaded.

13
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:36,542
Acknowledged.

14
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,375
Mr. Worf,
advise Beta Agni Two

15
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:40,333
that our departure is imminent.

16
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,083
WORF:
Aye, Captain.

17
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,583
At warp six, we should be there
at just over 16 hours.

18
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,959
Loading is complete.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,542
I am now proceeding

If you'll just acknowledge
this last load, Commander.

Hail the<i> Jovis.</i> I want to speak

46

Sir, Mr. Fajo
is hailing<i> us.</i>

47

48
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,417
Captain Picard,
what happened?

49
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,750
It's unclear.

50
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,375
We're running
a full analysis.

51
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:22,083
We detected no malfunctions
before the explosion.

52
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,375
Everything seemed to be running

53
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:24,875
as smoothly
as the other flights.

54
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:27,667
Were you able to save the pilot?

55
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,709
No.

56
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,208
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,917
Mr. Fajo,
I would like to analyze

58
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,583
your sensor readings
of the explosion.

59
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,125
Compared to the<i> Enterprise's,</i>
our sensors are

60
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,083
rather primitive.

61
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,375
I doubt they contain any
information that your sensors
overlooked.

62
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:49,458
Perhaps, but I don't want to
leave any avenue unexplored.

63
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,542
I understand.

64
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,875
We'll transmit the information.

65
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,667
Link established.

66
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:58,959
Receiving.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,291
Can we be of any further
assistance?

68
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,750
How much hytritium
did we manage
to bring on board?

69
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,500
81 kilos.

70
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,375
That may barely allow us to
complete our mission, Captain,

71
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,959
but it leaves us no margin
for error.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,500
Mr. Fajo, I realize we have
acquired

73
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,750
your entire supply
of hytritium.

74
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,834
Do you know where
we could obtain some more?

75
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,291
That may be difficult.
The only source I know is in
the Sigma Erani system?

76
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,750
Three weeks away, sir.

77
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:23,125
And I can't guarantee
they'll have any.

78
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,375
For obvious reasons, no one
wants to keep it around.

79
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:28,458
In fact, even I may stop
selling it.

80
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,542
It's just too dangerous.

81
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,625
I guess we're fortunate
you had any at all, sir.

82
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,625
Captain, transfer of
information complete.

83
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,834
Mr. Fajo...

84
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,041
thank you for your help.

85
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,458
Mr. Crusher, set a course for
the Beta Agni Two system.
Warp six.

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,834
Aye, sir.

87
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,542
The<i> Grissom's</i> near the
Sigma Erani system.

88
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,959
I'll alert them to stand by in
case we need more hytritium.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,125
Thank you, Number One.

90
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,750
Course laid in, sir.

91
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,625
Engage.

92
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,583
What am I doing here?

93
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,709
(<i> door opens</i> )

94
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,875
Oh. Wondrous.

95
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:51,583
The detail, the balance.

96
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:56,500
Was I not right, Varria?

97
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:01,333
Oh, what a remarkable
piece of work, hmm?

98
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,041
Why have I
been brought here?

99
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,709
Oh!

100
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,083
The... the voice simulation.

101
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,041
It's... it's perfection.

102
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,458
The inflections,
the timing.

103
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,417
(<i> snapping fingers</i> )

104
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,917
(<i> laughing</i> )

105
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,291
(<i> clears throat</i> )

106
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:20,959
Yes, uh, it took great
effort, effort...

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,125
to bring you here.

108
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,542
I was sure
it would be worth it.

109
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,792
I was right.

110
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:27,750
I've been delivered here
against my wishes.

111
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,375
I would like
to know the reason.

112
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,834
Certainly.

113
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:35,125
You have been brought here
for my... enjoyment

114
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,291
and my appreciation.

115
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,291
Am I to infer that you intend
to keep me captive?

116
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,667
Captive? Captive?

117
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,166
Oh, it's such
an inappropriate description.

118
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,750
My dear android...

119
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,208
may I call you Data?

120
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,291
It is my name.

121
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:58,208
Data, you will be catered to,
fawned over,

122
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,083
cared for as you never
have been before.

123
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,125
Your every wish
will be fulfilled.

124
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,667
I wish to leave.

125
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,166
Almost every wish.

126
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,583
This is unacceptable, sir.

127
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,542
I have no desire to remain here,
and even if I did,

128
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,959
my Starfleet duties
would not allow it.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,792
It's so...
single-minded, isn't it?

130
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,500
Very persistent.

131
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,250
But it's polite,
which is a very nice touch.

132
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,792
I decline to allow you to go.

133
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:30,625
Then I am forced
to attempt escape.

134
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,291
Uh, ten androids

135
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,500
just like you<i> might</i> be able
to force that thing open.

136
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:44,709
But then again, there aren't any
more just like you, are there?

137
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,667
It's keyed to galvanic
skin responses

138
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,875
and DNA patterns.

139
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,625
Sorry.

140
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,583
Then you will have to open it
for me.

141
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,709
Oh.

142
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,083
Really, I wouldn't do that
again if I were you.

143
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,792
This is a proximity-actuated
field.

144
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,375
It impedes positron flow.

145
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:21,917
It's very bad for the brain
paths in the long term.

146
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:26,083
I fail to understand
the value you place
on my presence.

147
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,917
Well, just look
around the room.

148
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,208
There are items here gathered
from half the galaxy.

149
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,000
Right here--

150
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:37,667
this is the very first basotile
ever created.

151
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,583
Oh, sorry.

152
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,792
It's very, very ancient.

153
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,792
Hundreds of years old.

154
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:51,083
Oh, it's priceless.

155
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,333
Come. This vase?

156
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,542
This vase is made
by Mark Off...

157
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,542
the late Mark Off-Zel
from Sirrie-Four.

158
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,792
A Dali.

159
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,291
This...

160
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,834
this is the only known
Roger Maris trading card

161
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,709
from Earth, circa 1962.

162
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,333
The smell?

163
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,875
Bubble gum--
I've preserved the scent.

164
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,166
Ah.

165
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,792
Uh... what, what?

166
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,875
Ah, a lapling.

167
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,750
(<i> humming</i> )

168
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,875
I thought they were extinct.

169
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,709
Extinct? Oh, good.

170
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,125
Yes, well, that is what
is generally believed.

171
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,750
She is the last surviving
member of her species.

172
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,208
(<i> humming</i> )

173
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,583
(<i> chuckles</i> )

174
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,208
(<i> humming</i> )

175
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,500
They're very defenseless
creatures, really.

176
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:58,625
Everything that you see
in the room here, everything,

177
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,166
one of a kind, unique.

178
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,166
All original.

179
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,250
Just as you are.

180
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,667
There, that is your
place of honor.

181
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,750
(<i> chuckles</i> )

182
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,959
Sit, sit.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,625
Sit.

184
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,500
You think perhaps it might
be uncomfortable?

185
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,792
But then again, you don't give a
thought to comfort, do you?

186
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:25,750
When Palor Toff learns of that,

187
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,291
he'll swallow his tongue
with envy.

188
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,125
I can't wait to see his face.

189
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,291
You... you are, um...

190
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:36,041
the crown jewel
of my collection.

191
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,625
You're a treasure
beyond comparison.

192
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,041
(<i> beeping</i> )

193
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,250
Yes, go ahead.

194
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,208
I think you should be flattered.

195
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,875
I am not, sir.

196
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:54,667
Most intelligent life-forms
find involuntary confinement

197
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,417
offensive and inequitable.

198
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,625
Moreover, you have violated
Federation law--

199
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,417
I know, I know.

200
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,750
What I've done is evil, selfish,
immoral, unprincipled, illegal.

201
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:06,667
Well I've learned to
live with it.

202
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:08,417
The Andorians
wish to make a bid

203
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,875
on the shipment
of Tellurian spices you offered.

204
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,041
They've had four days to decide!

205
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,542
Why do they decide right--
All right.

206
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,166
I must emphasize,
Mr. Fajo,

207
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:25,291
that I consider this captivity
a hostile act on your part.

208
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,750
Oh. Well, you'll
get used to it.

209
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,750
(<i> screeches</i> )

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,625
I can't believe he's gone.

211
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:56,834
Yeah, well I always thought
he'd outlive us by centuries.

212
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:01,250
He'd been working on this
for months.

213
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,583
Never felt it was
quite finished.

214
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,667
You know what a critic
Data was,

215
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:08,875
especially about
his own work.

216
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,291
That was a gift from the
captain.

217
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,792
And he should have it back.

218
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,333
Those should go
to Commander Riker.

219
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,208
Data always fell
for Riker's bluffs.

220
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,959
(<i> whistles</i> )

221
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,458
These are some of Starfleet's
highest honors.

222
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,834
Not bad for a walking
pile of circuitry

223
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,083
and memory cells.

224
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,083
You know,

225
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,291
I keep going over and over
the accident in my mind

226
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,291
trying to figure out
what went wrong.

227
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,375
I can see Data
in the shuttle

228
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,583
almost like
I'm sitting there next to him

229
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,959
going through
the departure sequence.

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,333
What the hell happened?

231
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:50,667
Why didn't I see it coming?

232
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:52,417
What am I missing?

233
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,041
Kivas wishes you to wear
this set of clothes

234
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,542
and to sit
in your chair.

235
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:13,208
I have no reason to accede
to Mr. Fajo's wishes.

236
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,709
He will give
you reasons

237
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,959
if you force him to.

238
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,125
Mr. Fajo is deluding himself if
he believes he can keep me here.

239
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,125
The<i> Enterprise</i> is certain
to find me.

240
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,000
They're not even
looking for you.

241
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,041
They think you're destroyed.

242
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,083
Your shuttle blew up.

243
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,250
A hytritium explosion.

244
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,208
They will scan the debris and
discover I was not aboard.

245
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,208
They'll find exactly what they
thought they'd find--

246
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,792
traces of your
component elements.

247
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:44,583
We put them aboard the shuttle
in just the right proportions.

248
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:50,208
Clearly, Mr. Fajo
has no moral difficulty

249
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,542
with my imprisonment here.

250
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,917
Mr. Fajo has
no moral difficulties at all.

251
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,709
Do you?

252
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,041
Clever, android.

253
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,166
Is it part of your program
to seek out vulnerabilities

254
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,417
in your enemies?

255
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,542
Yes. Are you my enemy?

256
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:12,083
I obey Fajo and so does everyone
on this ship.

257
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,458
Why?

258
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,500
You are a curious thing,
aren't you?

259
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,917
Do you object to the question?

260
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,625
Kivas finds ways to get
what he wants from his people.

261
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:26,333
His rewards for loyalty
are lavish.

262
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:33,208
His punishments for
disloyalty are equally...

263
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,208
lavish.

264
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,542
You won't find anyone

265
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,583
here on this ship
to help you escape.

266
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,000
Face it, android.

267
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,041
He has you.

268
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:48,083
It appears...

269
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,333
he has us both.

270
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,083
The reason
I can't find anything

271
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,166
is that there's
nothing to find.

272
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,166
I've run this analysis
dozen's of times over,

273
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,625
and there's just no indication
of any malfunction.

274
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,083
No explanation at all?

275
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,959
Oh, yeah, there's one,
but I don't believe it.

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,041
Pilot error?

277
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,542
I know it's hard to accept,
but even the best...

278
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:20,333
Captain, it's not only hard
to accept with Data,
it's impossible.

279
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,834
I mean, I can't even begin
to calculate the odds.

280
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,250
It's...

281
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:30,750
well, if Data were here,
we could ask him.

282
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,834
What are you suggesting,
Lieutenant?

283
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,583
I don't know, sir.

284
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:39,583
It just doesn't
make sense.

285
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,959
And I like for things
to make sense, that's all.

286
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,875
Geordi, maybe if you got
a little rest,

287
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,917
and you came at this
thing fresh.

288
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:49,792
A little rest isn't going to
change the computer analysis,
Commander.

289
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:52,834
I'm sure you have done
a complete investigation,

290
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:56,083
and if you wish to continue it,
of course, you have my full
support.

291
00:17:56,125 --> 00:18:00,125
But we shall be reaching
the Beta Agni system shortly,

292
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,375
and I expect you to be rested.

293
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,417
I understand, sir.

294
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,542
Dismissed.

295
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,875
Geordi...

296
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:21,333
I understand
how much we want...

297
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

298
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:26,542
even need to explain
an accident like this.

299
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,417
Sometimes there just aren't
any explanations.

300
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,875
For an android
with no feelings,

301
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,875
he sure managed
to evoke them in others.

302
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:52,000
We must select an officer
to replace Data at ops.

303
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,208
Recommendations?

304
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,166
Worf would be
my first choice, sir.

305
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,375
Mine as well.

306
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,041
Make it so.

307
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,208
"He was a man.

308
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,083
"Take him for all in all.

309
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:20,792
I shall not look upon
his like again."

310
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,792
Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu.

311
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,417
Lu-lu.

312
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:40,250
You are still wearing
that uniform. Why?

313
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,750
I am a Starfleet officer.

314
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:45,458
You are not
<i>in</i> Starfleet any longer.

315
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,083
It's time you adjusted
your program to accept reality.

316
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,417
Even if I chose to do so, it is
doubtful that my program

317
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,375
could be sufficiently altered
to accede to your wishes.

318
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,166
Oh?

319
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,625
I have been designed

320
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,458
with a fundamental respect for
life in all its forms

321
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,792
and a strong inhibition against
causing harm to living beings.

322
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,542
What a marvelous
contradiction--

323
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,250
a military pacifist.

324
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,583
Tell me, whose
dreadful idea was it

325
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:14,166
to enlist you in Starfleet
to begin with?

326
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,875
My skills seemed appropriate
to...

327
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:18,875
Data, Data, Data,
big mistake, grievous error.

328
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,333
You belong in Starfleet

329
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:25,959
about as much as I belong
in a verbal contract.

330
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,917
Tell me, Data,
have you killed yet?

331
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,208
No, but I am programmed

332
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,709
with the ability to use deadly
force in the cause of defense.

333
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,667
Shame on you.

334
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:38,083
Shame on you.

335
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,875
How neatly you rationalize
your capabilities.

336
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:44,500
How can you just casually
accept your role in murder?

337
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,250
I would not participate
in a murder.

338
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,000
Perhaps you misunderstand.

339
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,834
Can't you see how much better
it would be for you right here?

340
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,083
The intellectual rewards
alone...

341
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,959
our personal exploration
of the galaxy.

342
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,709
I am at war with no one.

343
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm your liberator.

344
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,250
You are a fine debater, sir.

345
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,959
It is a pity you have used
your verbal skills

346
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,375
for mere hucksterism

347
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,792
and the advancement
of your own greed.

348
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,875
Perhaps...

349
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:15,792
perhaps you would not judge me
so harshly

350
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:19,500
if you knew
of my desperate youth wasted...

351
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:23,000
wasted on the streets
of Zibalia.

352
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,542
Your past does not excuse
unethical or immoral
behavior, sir.

353
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,208
No it doesn't matter,
it isn't true anyway.

354
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,792
My father was quite wealthy,
actually.

355
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:32,500
He was a thief.

356
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,000
Data, why don't you put on
these lovely new clothes

357
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,041
and go sit on the chair.

358
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,125
I must decline.

359
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,875
You're going to be
much more of a challenge

360
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,125
than I had first thought.

361
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,583
Finoplak. 100 denkirs.

362
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:59,834
Now, Data, in the meantime,
here is something

363
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,542
for your logic circuits
to analyze.

364
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:11,083
Don't worry, the solvent
won't harm your... skin.

365
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,542
But in seconds,
it will completely

366
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,500
dissolve
that uniform.

367
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,709
Personally, I'd be
delighted to see you
go around naked.

368
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,125
I assume you have no modesty.

369
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:30,750
But then, I guess
that decency is the rule

370
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:33,709
of your
Starfleet training.

371
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,583
In any case, Data

372
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,166
why don't you
make a decision

373
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:42,625
about which alternative
you dislike the least.

374
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,333
Make a decision
by dinnertime tonight.

375
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,208
I've invited
a guest to meet you.

376
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,166
And I expect you to be
as entertaining with him

377
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:51,458
as you have been with me.

378
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,959
DATA:
Proceeding with departure.

379
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,500
<i>Enterprise,</i> shuttle bay two,
prepare for docking.

380
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,667
Level one precautions

381
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,625
remain in effect.

382
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,083
I did miss something.

383
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:44,500
Your first watch at ops?

384
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:47,709
I have served at
the position before.

385
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,834
I've been concerned
about you.

386
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,291
About me? Why?

387
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,542
Because I know
how I'd feel

388
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:58,041
if I was asked to replace
Data at his station.

389
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,625
Bridge.

390
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:11,041
Promotion due to the death
of a crew mate

391
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,375
is commonplace
on Klingon ships.

392
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:16,709
I know, but this
isn't the Klingon ship

393
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,709
and Data was your friend,
and it's the second time

394
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,375
you've replaced
a crew mate who's died.

395
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:28,417
I honor Data's memory
as I did Lieutenant Yar's

396
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,333
by attempting
to perform their duties

397
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,792
as well as they did.

398
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:35,333
In true Klingon fashion.

399
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:42,458
I appreciate your concern.

400
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:53,166
Computer, now replay
shuttle audio transmission

401
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:56,625
time index: 0423.

402
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:59,583
This is Data's second trip.

403
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,750
Hmm? All right.

404
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,375
DATA:
Proceeding with departure.

405
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:06,542
<i>Enterprise</i> shuttle bay two,
prepare for docking.

406
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:10,083
Level one precautions
remain in effect.

407
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:14,000
Shuttle has cleared
<i>Jovis</i> cargo bay.

408
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,458
It sounds just like
the first trip.

409
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,750
Exactly the same.

410
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,083
That's protocol
and that's Data--

411
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,583
following protocol
to the letter.

412
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:25,000
Okay, computer, now replay
shuttle audio transmission

413
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:28,458
time index: 0439.

414
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,959
Third and final trip.

415
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,333
DATA:
Loading is complete.

416
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,709
I am proceeding with departure.

417
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,000
<i>Enterprise</i> shuttle bay two,
prepare for docking.

418
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:40,291
Level one precautions
remain in effect.

419
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:44,333
That's it. That's the last
communication.

420
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:47,375
He didn't report the shuttle
clearing the cargo bay
of the<i> Jovis.</i>

421
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:51,041
Of course, there really wasn't
any reason for him to make voice
contact.

422
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,500
He knew we'd be monitoring
his position.

423
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:55,125
Any other pilot might not even
have bothered.

424
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:58,542
But Data, not following
standard procedures?

425
00:25:58,583 --> 00:25:59,625
What do you think it means?

426
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,166
I'm not sure, Wes.

427
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,959
I suppose he could have
been too busy.

428
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,458
Maybe he saw something
was wrong.

429
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,291
Without communicating it?

430
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,333
That doesn't sound like Data,
either.

431
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:13,792
Which means that maybe
something was wrong with<i> him</i>

432
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:16,458
but there's no other
indication of that--

433
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,959
nothing he said or did during
the entire mission-- none.

434
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,417
Sure wish I could talk
to the last people
who saw him alive.

435
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,542
(<i> door chimes</i> )

436
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:38,625
I've added a Veltan sex idol
to my collection.

437
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,375
I got four of them.

438
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:41,375
What?

439
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:44,083
With the pearls intact?

440
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,375
Please!

441
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,208
Pearls were added
by Ferengi agents

442
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,625
to increase
the value.

443
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:53,041
What is that?

444
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:56,458
Something new
and you didn't tell me.

445
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,959
Mr. Data, I'm
delighted to see

446
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
that you dressed
for the occasion.

447
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:09,291
Say hello to my very
good friend, Palor Toff.

448
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:17,250
Uh...

449
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:20,000
Data?

450
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,041
Say hello.

451
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:25,291
No need to be shy.

452
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:31,959
It's a mannequin of some sort.

453
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,125
This is not a mannequin,
this is Data.

454
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,750
This is formerly
Lieutenant Commander Data

455
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,125
of the Federation Starfleet.

456
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:40,208
The only sentient android
in existence.

457
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:45,333
It doesn't seem
particularly sentient right now.

458
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,375
That's cause it's playing a
stupid little game with us.

459
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,709
Well, someone has certainly
played a game on you, Fajo.

460
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,083
I don't find this amusing.

461
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:56,834
I demand
that you behave normally.

462
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,583
Behave... normally!

463
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:08,083
I know you can hear me!

464
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:11,709
He falls well.

465
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,250
I apologize for this.

466
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,291
Do not be upset,
my friend.

467
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,291
I'm having a delightful visit.

468
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,709
Come along,
Varria.

469
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,834
You're much
more fun

470
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:24,625
than Fajo's new toy.

471
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:25,917
You'll regret this.

472
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,458
Now entering
the Beta Agni system, sir.

473
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,750
Half-impulse,
Mr. Crusher.

474
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,250
La Forge to bridge.

475
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:42,583
Go ahead, Commander.

476
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,166
Captain, a class-two probe
has been loaded

477
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:49,625
with the hytritium compound
and is ready to launch.

478
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,667
Now approaching Beta Agni Two,
sir.

479
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:54,125
Mr. Crusher, put us into close
orbit.

480
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,041
Mr. Data, scan...

481
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,542
My apologies, Mr. Worf.

482
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:07,917
Scan the colony's
subsurface water.

483
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,625
Scanning.

484
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,667
Tricyanate contamination
confirmed.

485
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:15,166
Levels approaching
42 parts per million.

486
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:16,333
Area affected?

487
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,625
30 square
kilometers.

488
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,333
Any indication of source?

489
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:22,417
Highest concentration eight
kilometers west of the colony.

490
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,417
Adjust target coordinates.

491
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,750
Aye, sir.

492
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:26,083
La Forge to bridge.

493
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,709
According to these figures,
the 81 kilos

494
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,458
of hytritium should be enough
to neutralize the contamination.

495
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,333
Now approaching target
coordinates.

496
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,709
Launch probe.

497
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,917
Probe on target.

498
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:46,542
Hytritium entering water table.

499
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:51,166
Disbursement slightly
faster than expected.

500
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:54,917
Sir,
something unusual.

501
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,709
Specify.

502
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:02,208
I'm getting concentrated
tricyanate readings

503
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,875
of 70 grams per cubic centimeter
at the source coordinates--

504
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:08,166
much higher than
would normally occur.

505
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:11,583
Computer, report on geological
instability on Beta Agni Two.

506
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,792
COMPUTER:
No significant
geological activity

507
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:15,917
has been recorded
on Beta Agni Two

508
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:18,500
since the settlement of the
Federation colony.

509
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:22,291
Number One, perhaps you better
take an away team down and have
a closer look.

510
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,625
Aye, sir.

511
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:25,083
Dr. Crusher, join me
in transporter room three.

512
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,166
BEVERLY:
On my way.

513
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,709
Mr. Worf.

514
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:56,208
I would very much like our
relationship to...change.

515
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,834
You may expect me to use every
means at my disposal

516
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,166
to resist your wishes.

517
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,375
Why couldn't you just comply?

518
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:06,166
Why do you have to argue
all the time?

519
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,709
Couldn't you just go sit
on the chair?

520
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:14,792
Come on, go sit on the chair.

521
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:17,291
I do not intend to sit
in the chair.

522
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,417
You will.

523
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:22,041
You may not believe it
right now,

524
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,667
but you will.

525
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:29,875
Oh...

526
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:41,709
Have you ever seen
one of these, Data?

527
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,375
It is a disrupter.

528
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:48,208
Well...no, it's a prototype
for a Varon-T disrupter.

529
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,709
The Varon-T disrupter is banned
in the Federation.

530
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,667
Oh, yes, they only manufactured
five of them. I own four.

531
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:57,250
I sleep with one under my pillow
at night, and I sleep very well

532
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,959
knowing it's there, too.

533
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,959
Do you know why?

534
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,041
It is a most lethal weapon.

535
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:05,792
It's not just lethal, it's...

536
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,834
it's vicious.

537
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:10,333
It tears a body apart,
inside-out,

538
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:13,542
and does it very slowly, too,
by your phaser standards.

539
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:20,375
It's a tortuous, very...
very painful death.

540
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,208
I've always wanted to try this.

541
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,375
It is doubtful
you will destroy me

542
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:27,083
since you assign so much value
to possessing me.

543
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:29,667
That goes without saying.

544
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:36,500
Please come in.

545
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:41,166
Varria, how long have we
been together, my dear?

546
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,125
14 years.

547
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:45,500
14 wonderful years
they were, too.

548
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:49,166
She was barely an adult
when I found her.

549
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,625
She was idealistic,

550
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:53,959
naive and full of dreams

551
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,750
and I made those dreams come
true, too, didn't I?

552
00:32:56,792 --> 00:33:00,166
I'm going to miss you.

553
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,166
DATA:
Fajo.

554
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:30,250
The contamination
has been neutralized.

555
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:31,250
The water is clean.

556
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:33,041
WORF:
Curious.

557
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:36,083
The process of neutralization
should have taken several hours.

558
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:42,166
Naturally-occurring tricyanate
does not respond this quickly.

559
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:45,959
Are you saying
it's not naturally occurring?

560
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,417
There are no natural
trace elements present

561
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:50,000
in these tricyanate crystals.

562
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:52,083
If it's artificial then we're
talking about sabotage.

563
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,083
BEVERLY:
With tricyanate?

564
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:55,709
That's hard to believe.

565
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,083
It's slow to assimilate,
difficult to replicate

566
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:01,500
and hard to transport.

567
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:05,125
There are a lot easier ways
to poison a water supply.

568
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,542
More effective ways, too.

569
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,291
Can you think of any reason a
saboteur

570
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,750
would choose tricyanate?

571
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:14,875
It might pass
for a natural disaster.

572
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:18,834
And since there's only one way
to treat it, with hytritium,

573
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:22,333
maybe somebody figured
we couldn't locate it.

574
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:23,792
It is hard to find.

575
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:25,959
Then it really was
lucky, wasn't it?

576
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,333
That we were able to find
hytritium when we did.

577
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:31,500
And just enough hytritium
for this crisis.

578
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:37,542
Fajo was in the right place
at the right time,
just when we needed him most.

579
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:40,583
Are you suggesting he created
the problem just to solve it?

580
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:41,750
Possibly.

581
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,083
LA FORGE:
What, to make a profit

582
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,542
from his sale of hytritium?

583
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,041
It doesn't add up.

584
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,542
The cost of producing tricyanate
is very expensive.

585
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,667
He wouldn't make a profit on it.

586
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:52,166
Quite the contrary.

587
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,250
Then why would he do it?

588
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,125
What did he want?

589
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:01,333
Computer, biographical file
on trader Kivas Fajo.

590
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,125
COMPUTER:
Accessing file.

591
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:07,333
Kivas Fajo, a Zibalian trader
of the Stacius trade guild

592
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,083
educated on Iraatin Five.

593
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:12,083
A noted collector
of rare and valuable objects

594
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,667
including the Rejac crystal,

595
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:16,125
the<i> Starry Night</i> by Vincent
Van Gogh,

596
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,417
the Lawmin galactopedia,

597
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:19,834
the Malia Manda tapestry...

598
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,041
Computer, that is sufficient.

599
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,417
A rare and valuable object.

600
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,166
What if Data
wasn't on that shuttle?

601
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,500
Mr. Crusher.

602
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,417
CRUSHER:
Aye, sir.

603
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:31,667
Set course for the site
of the shuttlepod explosion.
Warp eight.

604
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:32,917
Aye, sir.

605
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,125
The<i> Jovis</i> has a maximum speed
of warp three.

606
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,583
He's had 23 hours.

607
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:45,583
So we can define a perimeter
of .102 light-years

608
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,917
as his possible distance
distance.

609
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:49,000
Fajo doesn't know that
we're onto him.

610
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:53,417
So he probably isn't taxing
his engines top speed.

611
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:55,542
He could have made it
to the Nel Bato system

612
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,917
or maybe even the Giles belt.

613
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,750
He's a trader.

614
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:02,208
He doesn't attract customers
by being hard to find.

615
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,917
We could put out a coded Level
Two query to all Federation
outposts

616
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,375
within the perimeter.

617
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:08,333
Make it so.

618
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:29,417
If I help you escape,
will you take me with you?

619
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,959
He's sleeping.

620
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And there isn't
much time.

621
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,750
The consequences
if we are caught...

622
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,417
I know
the consequences.

623
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,333
14 years...

624
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,959
you learn a few things.

625
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:50,166
There's an escape pod
in the aft cargo bay.

626
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,333
Captain, affirmative response
from station Lya-Four.

627
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:09,834
Fajo spent more than
half a day in orbit.

628
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,291
Departed just over
seven hours ago.

629
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,250
Mr. Crusher, new coordinates.

630
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:16,417
Lay in a course for Lya-Four.

631
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:18,125
Course already
laid in, sir.

632
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,041
Perhaps I should attempt
to communicate
with the<i> Enterprise.</i>

633
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,583
You can't.

634
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,917
Fajo has communications access
restricted to the bridge.

635
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:34,625
Once we're out,
the shuttle pod will emit
an emergency beacon.

636
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,875
We'll just have to hope
somebody responds

637
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:39,000
before Fajo is able
to destroy us.

638
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,166
I am trained
in evasive maneuvers.

639
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:43,667
We'll need a few.

640
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:45,417
Let's get going.

641
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:50,083
As soon as I start
the escape sequence

642
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,500
an alarm will sound.

643
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:54,875
We won't have much time.

644
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:11,208
(<i> alarm siren</i> )

645
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:22,959
VARRIA:
Oh, no!

646
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,375
(<i> screaming</i> )

647
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:50,041
It's your fault.

648
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,667
You knew the price
for disobedience.

649
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:54,917
And so did she.

650
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:01,917
Well, there's always
another Varria.

651
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,875
You won't hurt me.

652
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:25,125
"Fundamental respect
for all living beings."

653
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:28,750
That's what you said.

654
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,625
I'm a living being.

655
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:33,083
Therefore, you can't harm me.

656
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:36,625
You will surrender yourself
to the authorities.

657
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,792
Or what?
You'll fire?

658
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:42,583
Empty threat
and we both know it.

659
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:45,083
Why don't you
accept your fate?

660
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:46,959
You'll return
to your chair

661
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,709
and you will
sit there.

662
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,333
You will entertain me and you
will entertain my guests.

663
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:52,583
And if you don't,

664
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,750
I'll simply kill
someone else.

665
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:57,166
Him, perhaps.

666
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:59,458
Doesn't matter.

667
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,000
Their blood will be
on your hands, too,

668
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,333
just like poor Varria's.

669
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,500
Your only
alternative, Data,

670
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:10,041
is to fire.

671
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:12,333
Murder me.

672
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:13,667
That's all you have to do.

673
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:17,250
Go ahead, fire.

674
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:24,500
If only you could feel rage
over Varria's death.

675
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:28,542
If only you could feel
a need for revenge,

676
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:31,667
then maybe you could fire.

677
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:35,041
But you're just an android.

678
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:37,625
You can't feel
anything, can you?

679
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:41,959
It's just another interesting
intellectual puzzle for you,

680
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,625
another of life's curiosities.

681
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:53,500
I cannot permit this
to continue.

682
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:56,750
Wait, your program
won't allow you to fire.

683
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:58,333
You can't fire.

684
00:41:58,375 --> 00:41:59,750
No.

685
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:08,125
I'm reading a weapon
in transit with commander Data.

686
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,333
It seems to have
discharged, sir.

687
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,375
Discharged?

688
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:14,333
I'm deactivating it.

689
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,333
Welcome back, Mr. Data.

690
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:28,041
Are you all right?

691
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,500
Yes, Commander.

692
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:33,041
Please arrange to have
Kivas Fajo taken into custody

693
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,709
on charges of murder,
kidnapping, theft...

694
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,166
The arrangements have
already been made.

695
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:45,417
A Varon-T disrupter.

696
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,333
It belongs to Fajo.

697
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,834
Mr. O'Brien says the weapon was
in a state of discharge.

698
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:57,959
Perhaps something occurred
during transport, Commander.

699
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:22,250
Oh, have you come
to see me repent?

700
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:25,375
Your final satisfaction?

701
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:28,792
Want to see me
beg for mercy?

702
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:31,875
You're not going to get
any of that from me.

703
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:34,417
I expected nothing.

704
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:39,125
Our roles are reversed.

705
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:42,375
Aren't they, Data?

706
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:43,458
You're the collector now.

707
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:49,166
Me, I'm in a cage.

708
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:50,750
So it seems.

709
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:52,625
Don't count me out
too quickly.

710
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:53,875
I had you in my collection once.

711
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:55,834
I can have you there again.

712
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:58,125
Unlikely, sir.

713
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:04,500
Your collection
has been confiscated.

714
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:06,083
All of your stolen possessions

715
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:09,583
are being returned
to their rightful owners.

716
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:12,458
You have lost everything
you value.

717
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,166
That must give you
great pleasure.

718
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:20,667
No, sir, it does not.

719
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:23,667
I do not feel pleasure.

720
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:26,625
I am only an android.
