<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46071.6.</i>

2
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:07,375
<i>We have been called</i>
<i>to the aid of a transport ship</i>

3
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:10,375
<i>which has been attacked</i>
<i>near Rekag-Seronia.</i>

4
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:12,834
<i>Hostilities between</i>
<i>the two factions on that planet</i>

5
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,500
<i>have intensified recently</i>

6
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:18,291
<i>threatening an important</i>
<i>Federation shipping route.</i>

7
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,709
Captain, sensors have located
the transport ship.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,083
Two Rekag battle cruisers
are flanking it.

9
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,083
Red Alert!

10
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,250
Shields up.

11
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,291
Phasers on line.

12
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,792
Photon torpedoes
armed and ready.

13
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:31,083
Is the transport
still under attack?

14
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,083
The cruisers' weapons
are powered up...

15
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,291
Sir, the Rekag ships
are turning

16
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,041
and heading out
of sensor range.

17
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,542
They don't want
to take on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

18
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,834
DATA:
We are now within
visual range

19
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,000
of the transport, sir.

20
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,208
On screen.

21
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,458
Sensors indicate
damage

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,000
to the<i> Dorian's</i>
subspace emitter.

23
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,458
Audio communication
only, sir.

24
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,875
Open a channel, Mr. Worf.

25
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,917
Aye, sir.

26
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:53,500
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard

27
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:56,625
of the Federation
Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

28
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,709
Captain Talmadge of the<i> Dorian.</i>

29
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,375
Glad you're here.

30
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:01,792
We took some shield damage

31
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:04,834
from the Rekag ships,
but we're still intact.

32
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,250
Do you have
any injuries?

33
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,375
Can we assist you in any way?

34
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,834
No injuries,
but I'd like permission

35
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,542
to transport
two of our passengers

36
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,291
to your ship.

37
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,625
Of course.

38
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:19,417
We're conveying a mediator
to Seronia.

39
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,542
I think he's the reason
the Rekags fired on us.

40
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,959
(<i> signal breaking up</i> )

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,750
...traveled... negotiations...

42
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:30,125
Captain, I'm losing you.

43
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,917
Go ahead and beam
your passengers on board.

44
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,208
Counselor, after you've seen
to their needs

45
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,792
will you escort them
to my ready room.

46
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,625
Yes, Captain.

47
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:38,875
RIKER:
Cancel Red Alert.

48
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:40,667
Mr. Worf, take
the weapons off-line.

49
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,250
WORF:
Aye, sir.

50
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:53,917
I'm Counselor Deanna Troi.

51
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,709
Ambassador Ves Alkar...

52
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,250
and my mother,
Sev Maylor.

53
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:05,792
Counselor, it's imperative
that I speak to the Captain.

54
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,250
You think he's
attracted to you

55
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,834
but he isn't.

56
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,542
You offer him nothing.

57
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,792
ALKAR:
She's hasn't been
feeling well.

58
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,208
Could she be taken
to quarters?

59
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,583
Of course.

60
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,250
Chief.

61
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,625
I'll take you to Captain Picard.

62
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,542
Mother, go with her.

63
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,458
Don't pursue him.

64
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,166
I won't have it.

65
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,917
I'll stop you.

66
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,834
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

67
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:17,125
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

68
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

69
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:22,542
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

70
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:26,792
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

71
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:30,542
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

72
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:32,166
I'm grateful for the
Federation's offer to escort me

73
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:37,083
but if I arrive on Rekag-Seronia
on board the<i> Enterprise--</i>

74
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,834
the armed flagship
of Starfleet--

75
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:43,041
my mission as negotiator
of peace will be compromised.

76
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,875
There must be
a Federation transport ship

77
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,792
somewhere in the area
that could take me there.

78
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,208
With all due respect...

79
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,834
Admiral, to put the Ambassador

80
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,875
on board
another unarmed transport

81
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:57,000
would be to invite
a second assault.

82
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,542
I believe the attack on us
was an isolated incident

83
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,959
nothing more.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,125
Ambassador Alkar,
the Rekag-Seronia dispute

85
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,041
has threatened Federation ships
for many months.

86
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,750
We are grateful
that you are willing

87
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:12,166
to undertake this mission
and you have our full support.

88
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,750
Thank you, sir.

89
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:17,083
However, we also recognize
that safety is an issue--

90
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,583
not just yours,
but the crew that escorts you.

91
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,125
To send you
on an unarmed transport

92
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,792
puts everyone at risk.

93
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,709
I think it best
if you proceed to Rekag-Seronia

94
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,792
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

95
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:32,959
Then I have no choice.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,875
Once you get to Rekag-Seronia

97
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,000
you can conduct your
negotiations as you see fit.

98
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,625
Until then, you'll be in good
hands with Captain Picard.

99
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,250
I understand, sir.

100
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,542
Good luck,
and a successful journey.

101
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,333
Picard
to Commander Riker.

102
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,333
Yes, sir?

103
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,625
Set a course for Seronia.

104
00:05:58,667 --> 00:05:59,750
Aye, sir.

105
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,166
WORF:
That will be
all for today.

106
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,500
There will be another class
tomorrow at 0700 hours.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,375
The skills
are demanding.

108
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,375
You're very
disciplined.

109
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:49,917
I believe in a strong connection
between body and mind.

110
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,125
You obviously share
the same convictions.

111
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,333
Yes, I do.

112
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,250
Only sometimes, my body

113
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,917
has a problem conforming
to my mind's wishes.

114
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,667
(<i> chuckling</i> )

115
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,291
I would imagine that
your self-discipline

116
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,500
helps you in your work.

117
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,333
I don't know about that.

118
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:11,291
I think maybe my biggest
asset is patience.

119
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,917
I'll let everyone talk
until they're exhausted

120
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,667
and, when I start, they're
too tired to argue.

121
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,417
You're going to need
all your patience in Seronia.

122
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,917
I can't imagine
how you're going

123
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,917
to get those two sides
talking to each other.

124
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,625
Neither can I.

125
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,709
I won't know that
until we get there.

126
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,083
I tend to feel my way
through a situation.

127
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,834
Deck nine.

128
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,166
If I were empathic, like you

129
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,834
I'd have a real advantage.

130
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,083
I thought Lumerians
<i>were</i> empathic.

131
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,041
Only with each other,
not other species

132
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:53,166
so I don't have any idea

133
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,834
what you might
be feeling just now.

134
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,542
Curiosity.

135
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,291
What I sense from you
is very unusual--

136
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:04,166
calmness, serenity,
tranquility.

137
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,083
You seem to embody
the very qualities

138
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,500
that you hope to
draw out in others.

139
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,166
Tell me, Counselor

140
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,750
have you ever been involved
in diplomatic negotiations?

141
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,250
Several times,
with Captain Picard.

142
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,750
There have been instances
when having an empath along

143
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:20,125
has been helpful.

144
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,458
I'm sure.

145
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,667
I could use
some of that help.

146
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:28,083
Would you come with me
when we reach Seronia?

147
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,458
If the Captain
authorizes it

148
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,917
of course I will.

149
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,875
Good.

150
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,375
I hope to see you again.

151
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,083
You're late!

152
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,000
Mother, I told you
that I'd be gone

153
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,667
for over an hour.

154
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:44,166
You're late because of her.

155
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,667
Have you mated with him yet?

156
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:47,834
What?

157
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,083
That's what you want, isn't it?

158
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:53,000
Mother...
please, come in.

159
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,959
I can always tell--

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,291
the ones with a certain
look in their eye.

161
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,250
I'd better go.

162
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,208
Mother, please...

163
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,542
And I'll tell you this.

164
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,667
If you do,
you'll regret it

165
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,041
the rest of your life.

166
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,417
Mother, come in,
please.

167
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,875
You should lie down.

168
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,542
(<i> door chiming</i> )

169
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,959
Come in.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,959
Hi.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,625
It's that time again.

172
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,959
The dreaded crew
evaluation reports.

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,417
Oh, does it have to be today?

174
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,250
It's not going to be
any easier tomorrow.

175
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,041
It might.

176
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:51,917
What's wrong?

177
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,959
I've just had
a disturbing encounter

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,417
with Alkar's mother.

179
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,333
She frightens me, Will.

180
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,750
The feelings I
sense from her

181
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:04,166
are malevolent.

182
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,417
They're out of proportion.

183
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,417
They're evil.

184
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,375
Well, I know she's been
sick, and she's very old.

185
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:13,500
She's probably senile.

186
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:16,458
Who knows, we could all
end up that way someday.

187
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:24,500
You're right.

188
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,792
Okay, let's get through
these evaluations

189
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,375
and when we're done

190
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:34,041
I'm going to reward myself
with<i> two</i> ice cream sundaes.

191
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,542
First, molecular biology.

192
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,709
Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis.

193
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,458
Worf to Commander Riker.

194
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,875
Go ahead.

195
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,875
Can you report
to Ambassador Alkar's quarters?

196
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:47,250
There is an emergency.

197
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,417
We're on our way.

198
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,625
40 cc's inaprovaline.

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,625
I'm sorry, Ambassador.

200
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,875
She was ill.

201
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:21,750
I never should have
brought her along.

202
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:24,291
She was 93.

203
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,667
She'd lived
a long life.

204
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,917
I should be grateful
for that.

205
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,375
Alkar, is there
anything I can do?

206
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:39,375
Counselor, there's
a funeral meditation--

207
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,500
part of our rituals.

208
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:42,750
As an empath

209
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,041
you're the only person
on board

210
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,166
who could perform it
with me.

211
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,667
I'll be glad to help.

212
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,709
This meditation is one
of our most sacred ceremonies.

213
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,125
Hold the stone like this.

214
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:15,250
<i>Rohm gah, sevi rohm.</i>

215
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,500
Say after me.

216
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,875
An end to grief...

217
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,625
An end to grief...

218
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,458
an end to pain...

219
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,625
an end to pain...

220
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,083
strength comes from love...

221
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,542
strength comes from love...

222
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,083
...and courage from wisdom.

223
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,417
...and courage from wisdom.

224
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,250
Thank you.

225
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,625
Computer,
today's appointment calendar.

227
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:23,667
0900 hours, counseling session
with Ensign Janeway.

228
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:26,083
1000 hours,
counseling session...

229
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,750
Cancel them.

230
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,834
Cancel everything
till after lunch.

231
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,291
Acknowledged.

232
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,125
You wanted to
see me, Doctor?

233
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,667
Yes, Captain.

234
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,500
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm a little concerned.

235
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,458
I haven't been
able to determine
the cause of death.

236
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,750
She was elderly,
and Alkar said
she had been ill

237
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,709
but I found no evidence
of any disease.

238
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,959
I did find abnormally
high levels

239
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,750
of neurotransmitter residue
in her cerebral cortex.

240
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,041
What are you suggesting?

241
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,834
I'd like to do
an autopsy.

242
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,375
I've already
spoken to Alkar

243
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:11,542
and he informs me
Lumerian custom forbids it.

244
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,625
Could you speak
with him?

245
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,083
You suspect that her death

246
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,208
poses some kind of threat
to the<i> Enterprise?</i>

247
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,083
Well...

248
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:25,792
No.

249
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:30,750
Then we have no alternative
but to concur with his wishes.

250
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:04,709
(<i> door opens</i> )

251
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,125
Deanna.

252
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,417
Hello.

253
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,500
Come in, please.

254
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,917
I thought you might
like some company

255
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,583
if you're not too busy.

256
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,041
Nothing that can't wait.

257
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,542
Would you like
something to drink?

258
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,458
No.

259
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,166
I'd like you to talk to me.

260
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,291
About?

261
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,834
About you.

262
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,083
I don't know anything
about you

263
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,333
and I'd like to.

264
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,875
There's very
little to know.

265
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:50,250
I lead a very
simple life.

266
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,333
What kind of woman
do you find attractive?

267
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,417
Do you find me attractive?

268
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,083
Extremely.

269
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,792
And when you find
someone attractive

270
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:05,709
what do you usually do?

271
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:15,041
That depends on
a lot of things.

272
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,709
Is it really
so complicated?

273
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,542
It can be.

274
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:28,291
Well, perhaps
you overthink things.

275
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,208
Deanna...

276
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,083
Yes?

277
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,500
I'm sorry

278
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,959
if I led you
to believe...

279
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,375
You are very beautiful...

280
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:57,500
but our relationship
can't be like that.

281
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,458
Deck four.

282
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,417
Sir.

283
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,208
Will.

284
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,166
We were supposed to finish
the crew evaluation reports.

285
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,166
Of course. Come in.

286
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,542
Sir!

287
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,834
As you were.

288
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,875
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

289
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,542
I was just leaving.

290
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,875
If there's
anything else I need

291
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:11,250
I know where
to find you.

292
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,792
Yes, ma'am.

293
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,375
Are you bothered
by his being here?

294
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:22,875
Of course not.

295
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:25,291
Good, because it's really
none of your business.

296
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,000
I know that.

297
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,250
I believe we were with
Lieutenant Fratis

298
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,375
in molecular biology.

299
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:35,125
Why do I think
you're upset?

300
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,333
I don't know.

301
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,417
Could we just continue
with the evaluation?

302
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,667
Will, remember who
you're talking to.

303
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:47,458
You<i> are</i> bothered,
I can tell.

304
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,083
Deanna, I'm sorry I intruded.

305
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,500
When you're ready to work,
why don't you give me a call?

306
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,125
I will.

307
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:08,375
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46073.6.</i>

308
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,959
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>without incident</i>

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,208
<i>at Rekag-Seronia</i>
<i>where two members</i>

310
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,542
<i>of Ambassador Alkar's</i>
<i>delegation have been waiting.</i>

311
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,500
<i>They have joined us</i>
<i>to report on the situation</i>

312
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:20,208
<i>in the capital city.</i>

313
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,500
Things have
deteriorated steadily.

314
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,417
Rekag sympathizers
in outlying districts

315
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,250
have attacked
several towns.

316
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,583
But I was
under the impression

317
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,208
that there was
a cease-fire agreement.

318
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,500
Oh, it was broken before
it went into effect.

319
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:33,834
A Rekag shuttle strayed
into Seronian space

320
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,792
and was destroyed
by fighter craft.

321
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,542
Naturally,
the Rekags retaliated.

322
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,500
There's been fighting
ever since.

323
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,542
If they would just
sit down with me...

324
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,709
The Rekags won't go into
Seronian territory for talks

325
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,917
and the Seronians
won't go to Rekag.

326
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,667
In the meantime, they fight.

327
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,500
Ambassador, the situation
sounds so volatile.

328
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,667
Perhaps
a cooling-off period...

329
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:58,166
These people need an end
to the fighting now.

330
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,417
To delay a week,
even a few days

331
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,417
could cost
thousands of lives.

332
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,792
Then I would recommend

333
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,375
that we ask both sides
if they would agree

334
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,041
to meet in
the city of Darthen.

335
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,458
Why Darthen?

336
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,834
It's a coastal city.

337
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,583
It has been neutral
throughout the conflict.

338
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,709
Both Seronians
and Rekag loyalists live there.

339
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,250
It might be acceptable
as a compromise.

340
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,000
Contact their leaders.

341
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,000
If they will meet
me in Darthen

342
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,291
I will join them
there tomorrow.

343
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,458
I know it must be
my imagination

344
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,458
but it seems as though
Lieutenant Pinder

345
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,917
just doesn't want me
in his section.

346
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,875
What makes you
think that?

347
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,417
He's so critical.

348
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,000
I can't ever do anything
to please him

349
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,375
and I try, Counselor.

350
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:39,834
I try to make sure
there's nothing

351
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,750
he could find
fault with.

352
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,792
Give me an example
of what you mean.

353
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:44,959
Well, yesterday

354
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,625
I was running
routine diagnostics

355
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,083
on the sensor pallets.

356
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,291
They checked out

357
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,041
but Lieutenant Pinder
questioned me

358
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,041
because I'd allowed
a .023 variance.

359
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,792
That's well within
specifications.

360
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,458
He goes out of his way
to criticize me.

361
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,542
Do you know of any reason
why he might do that?

362
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,375
No. That's why I'm here.

363
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:11,250
Well, maybe he's just tired
of hearing you complain.

364
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,542
Pardon me?

365
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,000
I know I'm certainly tired
of it.

366
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,375
How do you think it feels
to sit and listen

367
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:19,917
to someone whine about
themselves all the time?

368
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,500
I didn't realize I was...

369
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,083
This isn't
Starfleet Academy.

370
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,792
You're not going
to be coddled.

371
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,208
If you can't take it here

372
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,166
then you might think
about a transport ship.

373
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,792
There's a lot
less pressure there.

374
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:37,166
But I love being
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

375
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,333
I don't want to be
anywhere else.

376
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:43,458
If you aren't up to it, then
you don't deserve to be here

377
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,750
isn't that right?

378
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,291
I guess so.

379
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,166
So you'd better take ahold
of yourself

380
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,041
or be prepared for transfer.

381
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,583
I will, Counselor.

382
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,375
Thank you.

383
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,125
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

384
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,000
Glad I could help.

385
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,917
Yeah, here we go.

386
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,125
Biofilter log
on Sev Maylor.

387
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,333
Geordi, could this
log have been damaged

388
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,875
in any way?

389
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:31,125
I don't think so.
Why do you ask?

390
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,625
There's a discrepancy
between the log

391
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:37,208
and the tricorder readings I
took just three days later.

392
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,041
The tricorder shows massive
physiological deterioration

393
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:44,417
compared with her condition
when she beamed aboard.

394
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,750
I find it hard to believe

395
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,000
that so much damage
could have occurred

396
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,041
in such a short
period of time.

397
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,083
Well, I can run a diagnostic
on the biofilter system

398
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,291
and your tricorder.

399
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,333
Thanks. Of course,
the best way

400
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,500
to get the
information I need

401
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:59,250
would be to do
an autopsy.

402
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,291
Ambassador, we've
received word

403
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,834
from the Seronian and
the Rekag delegates.

404
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:16,875
They've agreed
to meet with you

405
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:18,333
in Darthen tomorrow.

406
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,834
Thank you, Commander.

407
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,750
Counselor Troi has
altered her appearance.

408
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,375
Am I interrupting?

409
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,291
Hello, Counselor.

410
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,667
You want him

411
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:42,166
I can tell

412
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:43,750
but you have nothing
to give him.

413
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,333
Deanna, could I talk
to you in private...?

414
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,709
And you, you're
envious of him.

415
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,959
You pretend to support him

416
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,959
but secretly
you want him to fail.

417
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,667
That's not so.

418
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:55,333
Please...

419
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:56,750
You must return
to your quarters.

420
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,417
I won't. I want to be
here with you.

421
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,834
Ambassador!

422
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,041
The Counselor and I
are needed on the Bridge.

423
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,875
Of course, Commander.

424
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,166
I don't know what you thought
you were doing in there

425
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,959
but you were
way out of line.

426
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,375
Deck nine.

427
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:30,667
All right, Deanna, just
what the hell is all this?

428
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:33,917
<i>Imzadi...</i>

429
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,250
do you still care
about me?

430
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:39,458
Of course I
care about you.

431
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,083
I'm worried about you.

432
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,917
What's all this?

433
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,375
Don't you think
I'm attractive?

434
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:48,792
This just isn't you.

435
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,458
Oh... oh, it is.

436
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:56,250
You want me, don't you?

437
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:58,917
Deanna...

438
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,458
I need you.

439
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,417
(<i> yells</i> )

440
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,917
What is this?

441
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:12,375
Please!

442
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,625
(<i> door chimes</i> )

443
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,166
Come in.

444
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,917
Deanna, I'm leaving
for the surface.

445
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,417
You said
you'd take me with you.

446
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:45,250
I know,
but that's not possible now.

447
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,333
You said I'd be helpful.

448
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,542
You needed me.

449
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,000
And I still do.

450
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,875
You've done so much for me.

451
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:52,834
Then take me.

452
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,333
Don't leave me here.

453
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:00,166
Is Liva going with you?

454
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,333
She's been on
Seronia for weeks.

455
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:05,000
She knows the people,
the situation.

456
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,834
She wants to take you
away from me.

457
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,291
Deanna

458
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,917
you are my anchor.

459
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:15,208
I need you more than you
could possibly realize.

460
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,542
Do you understand?

461
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,208
I need you here

462
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,542
making it possible
for me to do my work.

463
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,375
I won't let her have you!

464
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:24,834
I'll stop her!

465
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,417
I will go with you!

466
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:34,709
Take me with you!

467
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,125
Please, Alkar!

468
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,583
Don't leave me!

469
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,542
Don't do this!

470
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,667
No!

471
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,083
You wouldn't have
recognized her.

472
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,375
Her dress

473
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:53,500
her hair...
everything about her wa...

474
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:59,542
I'm closer to Deanna
than I've ever been to anyone

475
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:05,083
and last night, she was someone
that I had never seen before.

476
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,625
And you don't know
of anything

477
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:09,083
that might have caused her
to behave like that?

478
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,125
No. I've thought
and thought about it.

479
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,291
I don't have an answer.

480
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:18,417
Computer, location
of Counselor Troi.

481
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:20,417
Deck six, corridor B.

482
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:21,709
Let's go.

483
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,125
Ambassador, I came to alert
you that the Rekags

484
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,750
and the Seronians
are in disagreement

485
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:34,333
about the seating arrangements
at the conference table.

486
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,667
I'm not surprised.

487
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:37,041
The good news however

488
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,875
is that the cease-fire
seems to be holding.

489
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:43,709
And that is by far
the best news.

490
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,166
Thank you, Captain.

491
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,542
Chief.

492
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,166
Will you take me with you?

493
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,333
Deanna.

494
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,208
Deanna, I already
told you...

495
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,959
I won't let her have you.

496
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,208
(<i> cries out</i> )

497
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,834
(<i> Troi grunting</i> )

498
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:09,709

Transporter Room Two.

499
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,166
Don't try and stop me!

500
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,166
No!

501
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,333
Let go!

502
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,333
It's nothing.

503
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,917
It's superficial.

504
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:21,542
What happened to Deanna?

505
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:22,625
All of the systems
in her body

506
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:23,792
have elevated readings.

507
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,875
Take her to Sick Bay.

508
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:28,166
I want to see you
in Sick Bay, too.

509
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:32,041
Captain, perhaps we should delay
transporting to the surface.

510
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,375
No.

511
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:35,375
You should proceed
with your mission.

512
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:36,750
Very well.

513
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:39,291
Chief, transport them
to the planet's surface.

514
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,667
Aye, sir.

515
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,250
CRUSHER:
We'll have
to sedate her.

516
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,583
20 cc's melorazine.

517
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,917
Yes, Doctor.

518
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:51,542
How's it feeling?

519
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,458
It's a little stiff,
but it'll be fine.

520
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,917
It'll disappear
in a day or two.

521
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,333
OGAWA:
Dr. Crusher.

522
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,875
I think you should see
these readings, Doctor.

523
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:02,792
Her neurotransmitter levels
are 300% above normal.

524
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:13,333
If you remember,
I found extremely high levels

525
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:17,041
of neurotransmitter residue
in Alkar's mother.

526
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,250
Could Deanna have picked up
some disease from her?

527
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:20,583
I don't know.

528
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:23,417
I need to do that autopsy.

529
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,375
I don't care about the customs
of Alkar's people.

530
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,959
I need to find out
if there's a connection

531
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,709
between what killed Maylor
and what's happening to Troi.

532
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,291
Picard to Lieutenant Worf.

533
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,125
Worf here, Captain.

534
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:40,417
Mr. Worf, contact
Ambassador Alkar.

535
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:41,500
I need to speak with him.

536
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:42,709
Doctor

537
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,500
neural energy is now
340% above normal.

538
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:48,875
WORF:
Captain, Ambassador Alkar
is at the negotiation table

539
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:50,458
and cannot be disturbed.

540
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,333
Proceed with
the autopsy.

541
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:02,166
CRUSHER:
<i>Medical Log, Stardate 46075.1.</i>

542
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,000
<i>I have performed an autopsy</i>
<i>on Alkar's mother</i>

543
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:06,917
<i>but instead</i>
<i>of answering our questions</i>

544
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:10,583
<i>the results have created</i>
<i>an even deeper mystery.</i>

545
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,959
I don't have
any explanation for this.

546
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,917
When I examined Maylor's body

547
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:18,542
I found her heart, her lungs,
her skeletal structure

548
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,458
most of the systems in her body

549
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,333
were those of a 30 year old.

550
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,542
But how could that be?

551
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,667
We both saw the woman.

552
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:26,792
That's not all.

553
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:30,208
I compared Maylor
and Alkar's DNA.

554
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,625
I don't know who that woman was

555
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:33,875
but she was definitely
not his mother.

556
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:41,333
Deanna's condition
is deteriorating rapidly.

557
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,625
She could die.

558
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:46,000
There are questions
that only Alkar can answer.

559
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:50,166
Picard to Lieutenant Worf.

560
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,709
Worf here, Captain.

561
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,500
Meet me in Transporter Room Two.

562
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:55,917
We're going down to the surface.

563
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,291
Aye, sir.

564
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,500
No, she wasn't my mother.

565
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:08,667
And she wasn't
93 years old.

566
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:10,959
Captain, did you
perform an autopsy

567
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,250
against my wishes?

568
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:14,417
Yes, for a very
good reason.

569
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:17,750
Counselor Deanna Troi
is in Sick Bay, dying.

570
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,834
Dr. Crusher doesn't know
the cause of her condition

571
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,417
but I believe you do.

572
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,834
Alkar, we need you.

573
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,333
The Rekags have withdrawn
some of their concessions

574
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:28,667
and the Seronians
are threatening

575
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:30,375
to break off the talks.

576
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:31,500
I'll be right there.

577
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:32,625
But...

578
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:39,041
They've been arguing
for hours in there.

579
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,959
It seems hopeless.

580
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,083
But now, when
expectations are lowest

581
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:48,417
now is the moment
I can be most effective.

582
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:52,875
If I am focused, centered,
free of disquieting thoughts

583
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,959
I can turn these
factions toward peace.

584
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,750
Alkar...
Hear me out, Captain.

585
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:58,500
It's important you understand.

586
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:08,667
You see, I
discovered long ago

587
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,500
I had the ability to channel
my darker thoughts--

588
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:13,583
my unwanted emotions-- to
others,

589
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:17,500
leaving
me unencumbered.

590
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:21,041
Is this what you've been doing
to Counselor Troi?

591
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,792
I hadn't planned it.

592
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,625
I'd expected Maylor to live
through the negotiation.

593
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:29,208
Her death could not
have been more untimely.

594
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,959
So then, you deliberately
used Deanna.

595
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,166
She's an empath.

596
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,333
I was reasonably certain

597
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,458
I could establish
a link with her

598
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,667
and frankly, I was amazed

599
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:41,417
when I saw how
quickly she'd aged.

600
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:44,333
Usually my receptacles
survive for years.

601
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,291
Receptacles?

602
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,125
Oh, come now, Captain.

603
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:52,458
Surely you can see
there's a broader canvas here.

604
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,667
If I came to these peace talks
hindered by unwanted emotions

605
00:33:57,709 --> 00:33:59,041
then the Rekags
and Seronians

606
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,083
would be condemned
to go on fighting.

607
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:05,125
You cannot explain away
a wantonly immoral act

608
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:08,166
because you think
that it is connected

609
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,500
to some higher purpose.

610
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:14,709
Captain, do you know
how many people have died

611
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,959
on this planet
in the last 48 hours?

612
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,208
Thousands.

613
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,083
Deanna Troi
is just one individual.

614
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:25,875
That does not justify
brutalizing her

615
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:29,500
nor any of the others
you have used.

616
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,291
Ask the Seronian
and Rekag children

617
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:34,875
who go to bed each night
in fear of their lives.

618
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:36,917
Captain, I get
no payment.

619
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:40,417
I have no power base,
no agenda.

620
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:43,750
I am willing to risk my life
simply to help others.

621
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,834
Do you think that makes you
appear courageous?

622
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,583
Because you're mistaken.

623
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,625
You're a coward, Alkar.

624
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:55,041
You exploit
the innocent

625
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:58,291
because you're unwilling
to shoulder the burdens

626
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:01,834
of unpleasant emotions.

627
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,208
Well, this time

628
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,417
you will be held accountable.

629
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:06,959
I'm taking you back
to the<i> Enterprise</i>

630
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,750
to release Counselor Troi.

631
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:11,709
I have no intention
of releasing her now, or ever.

632
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,375
Alkar

633
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:15,000
everything is falling apart.

634
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,166
You have to come now.

635
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,583
If you'll excuse me, Captain.

636
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:20,834
Mr. Wor...

637
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,166
I'm needed.

638
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,709
You and your security chief
will leave.

639
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,208
Lock onto Alkar's signal
and bring him on board.

640
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,917
Captain, I am sure
the Seronians

641
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:57,000
have reactivated
their security field.

642
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:59,208
Then work with Mr. La Forge
to find a way to break through.

643
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,458
I want that man
on this ship.

644
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,750
Aye, sir.
I'll be in Sick Bay.

645
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:08,291
If Alkar is flooding her
with this psychic waste

646
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,542
that would explain the high
level of neurotransmitters.

647
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,875
All these negative emotions
pouring into her

648
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:16,750
have caused a
chemical response
in her brain.

649
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:18,625
Isn't there something
you can do to counteract it?

650
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,208
Enzymic decontaminants

651
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,041
would be able to reduce
the level of neurotransmitters

652
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,375
but I can't make any headway

653
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:26,542
unless Alkar stops
what he's doing.

654
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,333
He has no intention
of stopping.

655
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,166
He feels perfectly
justified

656
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:33,125
in using her
until she dies.

657
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:36,417
Then Deanna has to die.

658
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:39,083
In order to save
Deanna

659
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,542
Alkar has to break his link
with her

660
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:42,000
and the only way
he can only do that

661
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:45,000
is if she's no longer
an adequate receptacle.

662
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:49,375
When Maylor died, Alkar turned
immediately to Deanna.

663
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:52,041
If Deanna dies
and he breaks
the link with her

664
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,083
then he will choose
someone else

665
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,792
possibly someone
from his own delegation.

666
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:58,458
Wait a minute--
you're talking about
killing Deanna.

667
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,583
I'll be able
to resuscitate her, Will

668
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,667
as long as it's not more
than 30 minutes

669
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:05,208
but the big question is
will that be enough time?

670
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,208
Alkar has to establish
a link with someone else

671
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,083
before we revive Deanna

672
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:11,333
or else he might
turn back to her.

673
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,834
We must bear in mind

674
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:16,333
that we'll be putting
his next victim at risk.

675
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,709
I want every possible
security measure taken

676
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,375
to protect that person.

677
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,041
How will you...?

678
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:27,041
I'll give her a hypospray
of dylamadon.

679
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,667
It's the gentlest way.

680
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:31,000
Proceed, Doctor.

681
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,375
Well, my friend

682
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:53,875
an era of bloodshed and conflict
appears to be over.

683
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:54,917
Alkar...!

684
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,250
What is it?

685
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:57,375
I'm fine...

686
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,875
just a little light-headed.

687
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:00,083
You're exhausted.

688
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,583
Do you want a doctor?

689
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:03,166
No, no, of course not.

690
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,333
PICARD:
<i>Enterprise</i> to Ambassador Alkar.

691
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:07,458
Respond, sir.

692
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,208
I'm here, Captain.

693
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,667
Ambassador, you must return
to the<i> Enterprise</i> immediately.

694
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:13,875
Counselor Troi is dying.

695
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,083
We are prepared to transport you
from the surface

696
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:18,083
whether you come willingly
or not.

697
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:19,208
There are security
force fields

698
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,458
protecting
us, Captain.

699
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,000
They won't protect you
any longer.

700
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,959
Transporter Room Two,
prepare to energize.

701
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:27,583
We're ready, Captain.

702
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:36,250
(<i> door opens</i> )

703
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,375
Computer, make a note.

704
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:44,375
Death occurred
at 1430 hours

705
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,375
from respiratory
and renal failure.

706
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,917
Will you wait for me
in my quarters?

707
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:51,375
Of course.

708
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:02,125
It's a tragic loss

709
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:03,291
but her death had a purpose.

710
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,625
I intend
to make certain

711
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,625
that you answer
for what you have done.

712
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,250
Your own Federation Council
has promised me

713
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:11,792
a safe and timely passage
back to my planet.

714
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:13,625
I expect you to honor that,
Captain.

715
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,333
How much longer
do we have?

716
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:30,917
Three minutes
and 40 seconds.

717
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,458
Transporter Room Two,
I want you to lock

718
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,875
onto the young woman in
Ambassador Alkar's quarters.

719
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,333
We may have to transport
her out of there.

720
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,333
Yes, Captain.

721
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,709
Mr. Worf, I want you

722
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,000
to station yourself
outside her quarters.

723
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:41,583
Aye, sir.

724
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,333
She helped me so much.

725
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:04,333
Without her, I couldn't have
accomplished what I did.

726
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:07,208
I'm so sorry.

727
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,125
Is there anything I can do?

728
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,458
Yes.

729
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,208
There is something.

730
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:24,792
If we could share
the funeral meditation...

731
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,667
CRUSHER:
We have a minute
and a half left.

732
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:32,625
Prepare a hypospray
of cordrazine.

733
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,792
We'll use that in conjunction
with the cortical stimulators.

734
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:36,792
Yes, Doctor.

735
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,375
<i>Rohm gah...</i>

736
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:42,083
<i>sevi rohm...</i>

737
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,458
<i>rohm gah.</i>

738
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,667
<i>Rohm gah...</i>

739
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:49,542
<i>sevi rohm...</i>

740
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:52,041
<i>rohm gah.</i>

741
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,291
We can't wait any longer.

742
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,000
Release the stasis field.

743
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:58,250
Yes, Doctor.

744
00:40:58,291 --> 00:40:59,959
10 cc's cordrazine.

745
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:06,208
Cortical stimulators.

746
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,667
Now.

747
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,125
An end...

748
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:21,583
an end to pain...

749
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:24,792
An end to pain...

750
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:26,083
Again.

751
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:29,500
She has a pulse.

752
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:30,875
Blood pressure climbing.

753
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,166
90 over 40.

754
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:34,625
Cortical activity
approaching normal levels.

755
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:37,000
Let's neutralize
the neurotransmitters.

756
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:39,250
Initiate
decontamination sequence.

757
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:40,625
Levels are dropping,
Doctor.

758
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,458
Down to 420% above normal.

759
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,333
390%...

760
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,375
Picard
to Transporter Room Three.

761
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:52,125
Not yet.

762
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,417
We won't know
if it's working

763
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:55,542
till the levels
are below 300%.

764
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:06,709
Alkar!

765
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:10,667
Alkar, what's wrong?

766
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:14,125
OGAWA:
Neurotransmitter levels
are down to 310%...

767
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,375
290%.

768
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:18,792
Now.

769
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:20,458
Picard to Transporter
Room Three, energize.

770
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,333
Let me go!

771
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:38,709
Neurotransmitter levels
are down to 230%.

772
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,041
(<i> groaning</i> )

773
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,208
Worf to Captain Picard.

774
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,750
Ambassador Alkar is dead.

775
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,750
Will...

776
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:29,917
Beverly thinks Alkar
must have been

777
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:32,625
at a susceptible point
in the meditation ceremony

778
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,750
when he was vulnerable.

779
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:36,875
Then the flow of
negative emotions

780
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:39,959
and feelings were reversed
back to him somehow.

781
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
That's our guess.

782
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:42,458
Like a man
with no immune system

783
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,291
he wasn't able to handle
the overload.

784
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,333
And Liva?

785
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:46,667
She seems to be fine.

786
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:51,041
He wasn't able to establish
a link on her.

787
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,750
Looking back on
the past few days

788
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:57,542
it's as though I'm looking
at a holodeck projection

789
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,417
of someone else.

790
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:00,792
That's how it seemed
to all of us.

791
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:04,625
Thanks for sticking by me.

792
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:09,709
I always will...

793
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,750
even when you're
old and gray.
