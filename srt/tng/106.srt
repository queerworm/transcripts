00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:08,875
<i>We have rendezvoused</i>
<i>with the</i> USS Fearless

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,000
<i>from which a Starfleet</i>
<i>propulsion expert</i>

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,375
<i>and his assistant</i>

5
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,583
<i>are beaming over</i>
<i>to conduct tests</i>

6
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:16,959
<i>on the</i> Enterprise's
<i>warp drive engines.</i>

7
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:19,250
<i>They have completed</i>
<i>similar adjustments</i>

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,083
<i>on two other Starfleet vessels.</i>

9
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,125
I don't understand
your concern, Number One.

10
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,333
They're not authorized

11
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,250
to make any alterations
in our engines.

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,750
According to
Starfleet's report

13
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,000
they will simply
run tests

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,875
on different ways of
entering warp speed

15
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,208
and different
intermix formulas.

16
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,709
Where's the
harm in that?

17
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,709
It's the specs
Kosinski sent us.

18
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:38,709
In my opinion, sir,
they're gibberish.

19
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:39,834
Gibberish?

20
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:42,250
Mr. Data,
would you explain?

21
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,875
Sir, we put Mr. Kosinski's
specs into the computer

22
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,500
and ran a controlled test
on them.

23
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,709
There was no improvement
in engine performance.

24
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:50,959
Then how do you explain
Starfleet's report

25
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,875
that the same tests
on the USS<i> Ajax</i>

26
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,542
and the<i> Fearless</i> over there

27
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,709
resulted in a measurable
increase in propulsion?

28
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:59,875
RIKER:
Our engines are new,
sir, top condition.

29
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,667
The tests on those older ships
may have simply been

30
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,667
to straighten out some
engine inefficiency.

31
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,333

<i>Bridge from transporter chief.</i>

32
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,000

<i>are ready to beam over.</i>

33
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,792
Stand by for
Mr. Riker, Chief.

34
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:11,959
He's on his way.

35
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,542
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

36
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,583
Since you're concerned
about these tests.

37
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,083
Yes, sir.

38
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,375
Captain,
if I may

39
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,542
I'll ask Counselor Troi
to look these visitors over.

40
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,083
Very good.

41
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,417
Welcome aboard,
Mr. Kosinski.

42
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:52,375
I'm the first officer,
Commander William Riker

43
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,333
and this is...

44
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,083
Where is the
Captain, please?

45
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,500
He's engaged in
other duties, sir.

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,041
A ship's engines
should be the concern
of a ship's Captain.

47
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,458
RIKER:
They are, sir

48
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,375
which is why they have
made the first officer

49
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,709
directly responsible

50
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,959
for an engine's
conditions and
performance--

51
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,959
guided, of course,
by one of our
chief engineers

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,500
Lieutenant Commander Argyle,
in this case.

53
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,917
A pleasure
to meet you, sir.

54
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:15,000
I appreciated
receiving the specs.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,208
To which you have
no end of questions.

56
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,917
Aye, I have.

57
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:20,875
And you, sir,
are listed as...?

58
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,333
As Mr. Kosinski's
assistant.

59
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,917
My actual name is
unpronounceable by humans.

60
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:28,959
You're from Tau Alpha C.

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,041
That's very distant.

62
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,875
All approved
and described

63
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,917
in the Starfleet
communications.

64
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:37,208
Now, I would like to
set up in the engine
room immediately.

65
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,208
I'll have our chief
engineer show you
to his engine room.

66
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,750
No need.

67
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,291
I know my way
around starships.

68
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,125
One thing that Kosinski isn't
hiding is bad disposition.

69
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,500
Agreed.

70
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,750
Also he's arrogant,
overbearing, self-important

71
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,917
and very sure of himself
and his ability.

72
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,041
And the other one?
His assistant?

73
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,542
He's the puzzle.

74
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:03,375
With most life-forms,

75
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,208
I can usually
feel something.

76
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,917
I may not be able
to understand or
interpret it

77
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:11,750
but I feel something,
if only a presence.

78
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,375
With him, nothing.

79
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,750
Empty space.

80
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,750
It's as though
he isn't even here.

81
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,083
Something about
this concerns me.

82
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,625
I don't know what.

83
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,709
I can point to
no reason... yet.

84
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,500
Stay concerned, please.

85
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,917
The safety

Why is this

100
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,792
He's working on
a school project.

101
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:42,959
And before you begin

102
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,083
there are
some questions.

103
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,625
First, tell us
how you arrived...

104
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,458
In order to
save myself time

105
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,250
let me ask those
questions for you.

106
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,750
You received the information
which Starfleet provided

107
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,709
you fed it
into your computer

108
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,542
as precisely as
humanly possible

109
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:58,166
then you did
a controlled test

110
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,959
and then, to your astonishment,
nothing happened.

111
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,041
So you said, "What's going on?

112
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,291
"This doesn't work.

113
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,750
Kosinski's a fraud."

114
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,166
You see, I have had
this conversation

115
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,333
on other Starfleet
vessels before.

116
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,959
They didn't understand
it, why should you?

117
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,125
Surely you're not saying
it's unexplainable.

118
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,917
I'm saying I'm
not a teacher

119
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,250
nor do I wish
to become one.

120
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,041
I have neither the
inclination nor the time.

121
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,250
You have all the time
you need.

122
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,125
I don't think
you understand.

123
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,667
This has already been approved
by Starfleet Command.

124
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:33,834
But it hasn't
been approved

125

Now you do.

129
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,625
Perhaps I should speak
to Captain Picard.

130
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,917
If you like.

131
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,250
It won't change
anything.

132
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:50,959
How basic shall I be?

133
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,667
I'll leave that to you.

So, here, then

Now, is this merely
mechanics

or is it nature
that we deal with
in all of this?

163
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,417
And what else than nature

164
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:30,333
are the elementals
of space and time?

perhaps even innovative

in a minimalist
sort of way--

00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,291
Then we should
let him try it?

180
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,041
What do you mean,
"Let him try it"?!

181
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,500
Don't talk about me
in the third person

182
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,208
as if I'm not standing
right here.

183
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,083
Yes, we might as well
let him try it.

184
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,375
Oh, yes, "We might
as well let him try it."

185
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,500
You are too generous.

186
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,000
Boy! Boy!
Don't play with that.

187
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:25,417
Captain, main Engineering
is ready to proceed.

188
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:27,917
Engineering,
this is the Bridge.

189
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,583
It's your call.

190
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,083
Do this one just like last time.

191
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,834
Nothing changes.

192
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,083
Commander,
I'll make

193
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,542
my preliminary
adjustments
at warp 1.5

194
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,083
and complete them
as we achieve

195
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,000
warp four.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,542
Engineering to Bridge.

197
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:43,875
Did you copy that?

198
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,166
Affirmative, Number One.

199
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,959
You ready?

200
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,667
We are.

201
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,000
PICARD:
<i>La Forge, set in warp 1.5.</i>

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,667
Warp 1.5, Sir.

203
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,208
Engage.

204
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,333
All right.

205
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,542
Here we go.

206
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,834
What are you doing?

207
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,375
(<i> alarms ringing</i> )

208
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,291
(<i> alarms continue</i> )

209
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,875
Captain,
we're passing warp ten.

210
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,375
(<i> rumbling</i> )

211
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:33,083
What is our velocity?

212
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,917
It's off the scale, sir.

213
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,583
Reverse engines.

214
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,542
Captain, no one

215
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,500
has ever reversed engines
at this velocity.

216
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,792
That's because no one
has gone this fast.

217
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:45,834
Reverse engines.

218
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,083
All stop.

219
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,041
Reading all stop, sir.

220
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,750
Position?

221
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,500
Calculating it, sir.

222
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,750
Data, what do you read
over there?

223
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,917
A malfunction, I trust.

224
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,375
Position, Mr. La Forge.

225
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,959
Well, sir, according
to these calculations

226
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,667
we've not only left
our own galaxy

227
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,166
but passed through two others

228
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,875
ending up on the far
side of Triangulum--

229
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,750
the galaxy known as M-33.

230
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,375
That's not possible.

231
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,834
Data, what distance
have we traveled?

232
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,667
Two million, 700,000
light-years, sir.

233
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,959
I can't accept that.

234
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:39,417
You must, sir.

235
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:42,333
Our comparisons show it
to be completely accurate.

236
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,375
LA FORGE:
And I calculate that
at maximum warp, sir

237
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,333
it would take over...

238
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,000
300 years

239
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,542
to get home.

240
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41263.2:</i>

241
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:08,375
<i>This will be a rather unusual</i>
<i>log entry</i>

242
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,625
<i>assuming Starfleet</i>
<i>ever receives it.</i>

243
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,709
<i>As I've already informed</i>
<i>my crew</i>

244
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,709
<i>a phenomenal surge of power</i>
<i>during a warp speed experiment</i>

245
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,709
<i>has sent our starship</i>
<i>hurtling out of our own galaxy</i>

246
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,333
<i>and past another</i>

247
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,875

249
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:29,709
Message on this has already been
transmitted to Starfleet, sir.

250
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,542
Which, traveling subspace,
they should receive

251
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,542
in 51 years,
ten months

252
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,917
nine weeks,
16 days...

253
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,083
Mister Data!

254
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,458
Sir?

255
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,959
Captain Picard, I presume.

256
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,625
We're still trying to determine
what happened.

257
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,208
The truth is, Captain,
I made a mistake--

258
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,041
a wonderful,
incredible mistake.

259
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,667
Just explain
what brought us here.

260
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,250
As the power grew,

261
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,917
I applied
the energy asymptotically.

262
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:58,709
I anticipated some tilling,
but it didn't occur.

263
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,208
Now, that was
my error--

264
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,125
using the Bessel functions at
the beginning.

265
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,750
What is he saying,
Number One?

266
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,500
To tell the truth, sir,
it sounds like nonsense to me

267
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,875
but... considering...

268
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,125
Considering...

269
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,875
where we are...

270
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,875
we must assume it isn't.

271
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,333
WESLEY:
Can I do something to help?

272
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,500
I can call my mother.

273
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,542
She's a doctor.

274
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,500
No, there's nothing
she can do.

275
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,834
I need to rest.

276
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,667
I've been away
too long.

277
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,417
What happened to you?

278
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:34,875
Is it part of
what happened
to the ship?

279
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,000
Please believe me.

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I mean no harm
to this vessel

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,291
or those in it.

282
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,667
Is Mr. Kosinski
like he sounds?

283
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,083
A joke?

284
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,458
No, that's too cruel.

285
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,834
He has sensed some
small part of it.

286
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,417
That space and time
and thought

287
00:14:57,417 --> 00:15:00,709
aren't the separate things
they appear to be?

288
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,417
I just thought
the formula you were using

289
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,667
said something
like that.

290
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,834
Boy, don't ever
say that again

291
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,083
especially not
at your age

292
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,041
in a world that's
not ready for such...

293
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,041
such dangerous
nonsense.

294
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,458
I've always suspected

295
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,834
that this rate of speed
was possible, of course

296
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:23,625
but at this level--
no, never.

297
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,375
We're going to need new
definitions, new parameters.

298
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:32,083
You could call it
the Kosinski Scale.

299
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,542
Why not?

300
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:36,583
Yes, of course,
since I'm the
one who has made

301
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,917
the so-called warp
barrier meaningless.

302
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:43,458
And Captain, this must be
a special thrill for you.

303
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,500
Thrill?

304
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,208
Mm-hmm, as an explorer.

305
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,458
In three centuries
of space travel

306
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,875
we've charted just
11 percent of our galaxy.

307
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:54,458
And then...
we accomplish this.

308
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,667
Yes, but isn't the real point

309
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,750
can you do it again?

310
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,750
Can you get us home?

311
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,083
Well, of course, I can.

312
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,083
I'll just do what I did before.

313
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:12,875
Coming, Riker?

314
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,333
<i>Commander</i> Riker will
join you soon in a moment.

315
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,458
Comment is invited.

316
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,917
Counselor?

317
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,458
He's convinced he's right.

318
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,917
I've no doubt of that.

319
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:36,125
Captain, can you allow
a man who's made one mistake

320
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,583
back into a position
where he may make another?

321
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,875
Captain, what
are our options, really?

322
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,834
I mean, if this guy
can't get us back, who will?

323
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,458
Captain,
we're here.

324
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,834
Why not avail ourselves
of this opportunity for study?

325
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:50,625
There is a giant
protostar here

326
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,333
in the process
of forming.

327
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,792
No other vessel has
been out this far.

328
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:58,125
Spoken like a true
Starfleet graduate.

329
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,125
It is tempting,
eh, Number One?

330
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,709
Aye, sir, it is.

331
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,041
But as they say, sir,
you're the Captain.

332
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,875
I know that If Kosinski
can get us home

333
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,875
Starfleet can use
his technique

334
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,709
to bring back
a pure science vessel.

335
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,250
Do even more.

336
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,083
Number One, tell
Kosinski to prepare
to get us out of here.

337
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,166
Aye, sir.

338
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:28,500
Do you realize how many
great advancements of mankind

339
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,834
have been tied to speed?

340
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,875
This is a moment in history

341
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,375
right here, right now.

342
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:38,458
And your names will be
forever linked with mine.

343
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,834
Excuse me,
Commander Riker.

344
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:48,667
I don't think
he did this.

345
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,375
I think...
Not now, Wes.

346
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,583
PICARD:
<i>Standing by, Number One.</i>

347
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,083
But, sir... when
all this happened

348
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,583
I was watching
his assistant...

349
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,458
I'm sure this is
fascinating, Wesley

350
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,166
and I am looking forward
to hearing all about it

351
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,417
but not right now.

352
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:03,792
Aye, sir.

353
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,959
Come on.

354
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,583
He's too tired.

355
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,875
Why don't you
do it by yourself?

356
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,041

I am ready, first officer.

Captain, why are we
at general quarters?

451
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,792
I have to get
everyone's attention.

452
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,625
This seemed to be
the quickest way.

453
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,041
This is the Captain.

454
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,000
This is not a drill.

455
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,500
It seems that
in this place

the world of the
physical universe

457
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,583
and the world
of ideas

458
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,959
is somehow
intermixed.

459
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,875
What we think

460
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,500
<i>also becomes a reality.</i>

461
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,250
<i>We must, therefore</i>

462
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,917
<i>I repeat, must</i>

00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,792
<i>begin controlling our thoughts.</i>

00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,875
<i>We will give you</i>

00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:10,750
What did you do?

469
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,333
It wasn't him;
it never was.

470
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,583
It was his
assistant.
What are you talking about?

471
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,750
Kosinski wasn't the one
controlling the warp experiment.

472
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,917
It was me!

473
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,041
The equations
he punched in

474
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,083
were nonsense,
just as we thought.

475
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,250
I honestly thought
it was me.

476
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,333
I thought somehow...

477
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,792
somehow I was operating
on his level.

478
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:31,166
It was also
my fault, Captain.

479
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,750
I should have realized
it wasn't Kosinski.

480
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,750
How could you?

481
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,625
How could any of us?

482
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,917
Wesley did.

483
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:44,166
If you knew something,
why didn't you say so?

484
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,000
He tried, twice.
I didn't listen.

485
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,875
He's unconscious.

486
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,125
Why?

487
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,458
I'm not
certain yet.

488
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,000
He phased, sir.

489
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,917
What does that mean?

490
00:27:57,917 --> 00:28:01,625
Parts of him disappeared
and then came back.

491
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:04,583
Nobody else was
paying attention to
him the first time.

492
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,834
When we saw
it this time

493
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:08,041
he seemed to
be struggling,
fighting it.

494
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,500
BEVERLY:
He's dying.

495
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,834
He mustn't.

496
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:13,291
He's the only one
who can get us back.

497
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,959
Realistically, that
doesn't seem possible.

I don't know.

My equipment doesn't
register his kind
of life signs.

509
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,792
I would have to guess
exhaustion, fatigue.

510
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,667
Is he going to be all right?

Mom, he's my friend.

513
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:58,667
You may want him here
before we're done, sir.

514
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,041
He seems to have
developed some sort of

515
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,458
special attachment
to the boy.

516
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,208
My name is Wesley,
Commander Riker.

517
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,917
He knows.

518
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:08,500
We all know.

519
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,917
Will he live?

520
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:13,208
I'm not sure.

521
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,667
Wake him.

522
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,959
I recommend we let
him come around
on his own time.

523
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,709
We don't have that luxury.
Wake him.

524
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:22,500
He could die,
and with him any
chance we have.

526
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,917
we all have other friends
on board this ship.

527
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:29,709
If we stay here much longer,
we may lose the ability

thought and reality.

529
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:35,250

wake him now.

00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:18,875
What is your destination?

539
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:21,959
TRAVELER:
Destination?

540
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:24,417
Yes, what place are
you trying to reach?

541
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:25,959
Ah, place, no.

542
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:28,959
There is no specific place
I wish to go.

543
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,583
Then what is
the purpose of your journey?

544
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,542
Curiosity.

545
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,000
PICARD:
That's not
an answer.

546
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,917
TRAVELER:
I have certain
abilities.

547
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:40,291
They give me a knowledge
of propulsion.

548
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,125
I've been trading
this for passage

549
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,709
on Starfleet
vessels.

550
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,125
RIKER:
And allowing Kosinski
to take credit

551
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,375
for what you did?

552
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,125
TRAVELER:
It seemed
the sensible way.

553
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,875
Until now.

554
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:53,625
Captain, I seek
only transportation

555
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:57,291
in order to see
and experience your reality.

556
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,625
I am no threat
to you,

557
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,750
your ship or your crew.

558
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,166
He isn't, Captain.
I know he isn't.

559
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,375
PICARD:
Our "reality"?

560
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:09,000
And in order to satisfy
this curiosity

561
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,208
you have brought my ship

562
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,917
and my crew
into grave risk.

563
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:14,959
I have made some mistakes.

564
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,166
Some mistakes?

565
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,834
What mistakes could
possibly explain

566
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,959
these incredible explosions
of velocity?

567
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:27,709
I don't know if I can put this
in terms you'll understand.

568
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:32,041
I believe that there
may be a warp speed

569
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:35,792
that can get us
beyond galaxy M-33

570
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:39,834
but there is no velocity
of any magnitude

571
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,875
that can possibly bring us...

572
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:44,250
wherever this is.

573
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,041
Is it true what our navigational
sensors are telling us?

574
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:50,291
Are we... are we
millions of light-years away

575
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,333
from where we were?

576
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,875
Yes.

577
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,583
But what
got us here?

578
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,583
Thought.

579
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,542
Thought?

580
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,000
You do understand,
don't you

581
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,667
that thought is the basis
of all reality?

582
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,959
The energy of thought--
to put it in your terms--

583
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,875
is very powerful.

584
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,834
That's not an
explanation.

585
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,166
I have
the ability

586
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:14,875
to act like a lens
which focuses thought.

587
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:18,667
That's just
so much nonsense.

588
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,834
You're asking us
to believe in magic.

589
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,375
Well, yes, this... this could
seem like magic to you.

590
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,583
PICARD:
No.

591
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:31,417
No, it actually
makes sense to me.

592
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,375
Only the power of
thought could explain

593
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,333
what has been happening,
especially out here.

594
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:41,333
Thought is the essence
of where you are now.

595
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:44,208
You do understand
the danger, don't you?

596
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,458
Chaos.

597
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:46,792
What we think is what happens.

598
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:50,709
It pains me I was
so careless, Captain.

599
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:54,000
My intent was only to observe,
not to cause this.

600
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,959
You should not be here until
your far, far distant future.

601
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:01,333
Certainly not until
you've learned control.

602
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,625
You are from a different time,
aren't you?

603
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,875
No, not exactly
from another time...

604
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:10,709
well, as you understand
the concept...

605
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:14,375
yes, perhaps that term
fits as well as any.

606
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,083
And you have
this ability

607
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,709
to travel?
Yes.

608
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:19,542
And others of your kind
have the same ability?

609
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:21,125
Oh, yes.
Then why...

610
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,166
in all of our history,
is there no record of you

611
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:24,625
or someone like you
ever having visited us?

612
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,750
What wonderful arrogance.

613
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,250
There is no record

614
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,583
because we have not
visited you before.

615
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:32,583
Why not?

616
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,667
Well, because...

617
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:37,834
up until now,
if you'll forgive this

618
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:40,750
you've been uninteresting.

619
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,000
It's only now
that your life-form

620
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,583
merits serious attention.

621
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,750
I...

622
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,667
I'm-I'm sorry.

623
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:52,792
What's happening?

624
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:55,083
He's unconscious again.

625
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,917
PICARD:
Revive him.

626
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:59,875
Whatever you need from him,
you better get it soon.

627
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,834
If I may suggest, sir,
our first leap

628
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:04,291
out of our galaxy was,
as he said, a mistake.

629
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:07,250
PICARD:
Unless he was distracted
by something.

630
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,959
RIKER:
And it weakened him

631
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:11,750
in some way resulting
in the incredible leap out here.

632
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,166
Theory.

633
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:16,166
Do you have any facts
that fit this?

634
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:17,125
Can you get us back?

635
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,792
Wait, Captain,
not so fast.

636
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:22,458
We have an opportunity here
for scientific discovery.

637
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:24,333
And we report
our observations how?

638
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,500
To whom?

639
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,709
Can you get us back?

640
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:32,875
I will try.

641
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:37,125
Number One, take him down
to main Engineering.

642
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,291
I'll be on
the Bridge.

643
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,917
No!

644
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:41,750
He's very weak.

645
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,750
The Captain is right--
we must hurry.

646
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,750
But first I request
a moment with the Captain...

647
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,542
alone.

648
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,125
Strange how he seems
to care for you.

649
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,166
He will forget me
in time,

650
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:16,709
which is
as it should be.

651
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:19,625
It's Wesley I wanted
to speak to you about.
The boy?

652
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:22,291
It's best you do
not repeat this
to the others--

653
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:23,625
especially not
to the mother.

654
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,000
Whatever happens

655
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
it is imperative that
it proceed naturally.

656
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,750
I must get
my ship back.

657
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,125
Do we have time for this?

658
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,083
Oh, yes.

659
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:36,959
He and a few like him
are why I travel.

660
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,083
You have it
in your power

661
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,750
to encourage him
without interfering.

662
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,500
Encourage him in what?

663
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,875
How shall I explain?

664
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:52,083
Are you familiar
with the intricacies

665
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,500
of what is
called here "music"?

666
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,709
Somewhat.

667
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:57,333
And such musical genius

668
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,375
as I saw in one
of your ships' libraries--

669
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:00,834
one called Mozart

670
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:04,458
who as a small child
wrote astonishing symphonies.

671
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:05,792
A genius

672
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:08,083
who made music
not only to be heard

673
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,542
but seen and felt

674
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:13,875
beyond the understanding,
the ability of others.

675
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,792
Wesley is such a person.

676
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,417
Not with music

677
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:20,000
but with the equally
lovely intricacies

678
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,375
of time, energy,
propulsion...

679
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,917
and the instruments
of this vessel

680
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:27,667
which allow
all that to be played.

681
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,208
You're right.
I must hurry now

682
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:32,792
but you're right
in something else.

683
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,625
He is just a boy for now.

684
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,875
He should be encouraged

685
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,333
but told
none of this.

686
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:42,709
We've got to
get back home.

687
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:43,709
Take him to
main Engineering.

688
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:44,834
Yes, sir.

689
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:46,375
I'll be on
the Bridge.
Yes, sir.

690
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,834
(<i> gasping</i> )

691
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,250
Put it out!
How?

692
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,792
Think!

693
00:36:57,792 --> 00:37:00,458
Put the flame
out in your thoughts.

694
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:05,458
(<i> gasping, groaning</i> )

695
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,500
Now, get to your station

696
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,000
and concentrate on
your assignment.

697
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,125
Yes, sir.

698
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,500
<i>Captain's Log:</i>

699
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,875
<i>Any</i> time<i> entry is meaningless.</i>

700
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,792
<i>We have no choice</i>
<i>but to repeat</i>

701
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,417
<i>the same warp experiment</i>

702
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:30,375
<i>but with one variation.</i>

703
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:33,083
<i>A principal part</i>
<i>of this warp formula</i>

704
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,417
<i>will be the thoughts</i>

705
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:36,500
<i>of everyone aboard</i>
<i>the</i> Enterprise.

706
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,875
<i>We have no idea exactly</i>
<i>how this works.</i>

707
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:41,834
<i>We understand only</i>
<i>that the traveler</i>

708
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:43,792
<i>makes use of this somehow.</i>

709
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:46,166
<i>It will be most important</i>
<i>that those aboard avoid</i>

710
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:49,125
<i>random thoughts that might</i>
<i>change the reality</i>

711
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,875
<i>of what we're attempting to do.</i>

712
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,875
Do you have any
further advice, Counselor?

713
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,834
When you begin the attempt,
there will be stress

714
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:01,875
and it's only
natural the crew's

715
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,792
concentration
will shift.

716
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:06,667
Plus some genuine fear, Captain.

717
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:08,834
You can't notice
what's happening outside

718
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:09,917
without feeling some of that.

719
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,583
(<i> boatswain's whistle blows</i> )

720
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,750
All decks, all stations

721
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,875
<i>this is the Captain speaking.</i>

722
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,250
<i>All decks, I must have</i>
<i>your full attention.</i>

723
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,875
<i>In a few moments,</i>
<i>as we attempt to warp back home</i>

724
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,417
<i>it is vital--</i>
<i>absolutely vital--</i>

725
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:29,041
<i>that you center your thoughts</i>
<i>on your duty</i>

726
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:32,000
<i>or on the welfare</i>
<i>of the one called the traveler.</i>

727
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,875
<i>Think of giving him</i>
<i>some of your strength.</i>

728
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,542
<i>Now, this is an order.</i>

729
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,834
<i>You must try to do this.</i>

730
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:42,166
And, now...

731
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:45,000
attempt to concentrate
completely

732
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,542
on your duty of the moment

733
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:49,583
or on the traveler

734
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,291
on his well-being.

735
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:55,500
<i>Think of him as someone</i>
<i>you care deeply for.</i>

736
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:01,875
All decks, all stations--

737
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,333
battle stations.

738
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:06,625
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

739
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:09,959
I will need Kosinski
back on the main computer.

740
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:15,333
You need me?

741
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,834
Yes.

742
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:26,875
Helm, set in warp 1.5,
retroactive course.

743
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,834
LA FORGE:
Warp 1.5

744
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,542
retroactive 2-6-1

745
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:34,458
mark 3-1, sir.

746
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,375
Bridge to Engineering,
stand by.

747
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,709
I feel such an abundance
of well-being on the ship.

748
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:46,166
It feels like...

749
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,333
...quite wonderful.

750
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:50,917
RIKER:
<i>Engineering to Bridge,</i>
<i>we're ready.</i>

751
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,959
On my order, Mr. Data,
Mr. La Forge.

752
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:00,583
Engage.

753
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,208
It's not happening.

754
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,458
It's not enough.

755
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,792
Warp 1.5, sir--

756
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:43,959
which is what
my instruments
have read all along.

757
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,917
And our position reads
exactly what it was

758
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:49,041
before this sleigh ride
began, sir.

759
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,583
Cease red alert.

760
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:51,959
Sleigh ride?

761
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:53,750
Or whatever you want
to call it, Data.

762
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,542
I don't have
a proper name for it.

763
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:57,959
The traveler's
gone, sir.

764
00:41:57,959 --> 00:41:59,083
Gone?

765
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,208
He's phased...

766
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,917
completely out
of existence--

767
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:05,208
at least out
of our existence.

768
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:06,625
(<i> boatswain's whistle blows</i> )

769
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,625
Attention all decks.

770
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:11,583
This is to inform you
that with your support

771
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,125
the traveler has returned us
to our own galaxy.

772
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:18,458
However, he has now left us.

773
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:22,291
Wherever he has gone,

774
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,417
we wish him well.

775
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,333
Have the boy sent to the Bridge,
Number One.

776
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:30,917
Wesley Crusher,
report to the Bridge.

777
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,792
On the double.

778
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:34,375
Our next assignment
is on this heading?

779
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,875
Yes, sir.

780
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,166
Mr. Data,
Mr. La Forge

781
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,166
increase to warp five,
same heading.

782
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,500
Warp five, sir.

783
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,000
On that same heading, sir.

784
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:46,583
Oh, Wesley,
come on the Bridge.

785
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:47,917
Move!

786
00:42:51,709 --> 00:42:52,917
Commander Riker has told me

787
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:54,834
how supportive you were
in Engineering.

788
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:56,375
Well done.

789
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,583
Oh, at ease.

790
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,208
Sit here in command.

791
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,959
RIKER:
Captain,
it's not allowed.

792
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:04,375
Your orders.

793
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:06,542
Oh, that's true.

794
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:10,625
Well, uh, I, uh,
can't waive them again.

795
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,667
Only commissioned officers.

796
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:17,375
It's quite all right, sir.
I understand.

797
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,375
Please don't
interrupt me, Wesley.

798
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:20,709
I'm sorry, sir.

799
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,041
Any commissioned rank?

800
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:27,542
Even Ensign?

801
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:30,709
That would give him
authorized access
to the Bridge.

802
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:34,250
Well, then, I'll have to
make him an acting Ensign.

803
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:38,041
Captain's Log,

804
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:41,500
Stardate 41263.4:

805
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:44,375
For outstanding
performance

806
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:45,834
in the best
Starfleet tradition

807
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:48,166
Wesley Crusher is
made acting Ensign

808
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:51,834
with the duties
and privileges
of that rank

809
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:55,458
and whether that rank
becomes permanent, Mr. Crusher

810
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:57,083
depends on you.

811
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,458
At the earliest opportunity,
your entrance application

812
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:02,041
for Starfleet Academy
will be tendered.

813
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:04,417
Until then,
you will learn this ship--

814
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:06,166
every operation, every function.

815
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:09,792
Commander Riker, a duty
schedule for Mr. Crusher

816
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:11,166
heavy on study.

817
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:12,625
Aye, sir.

818
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:16,417
Meanwhile, you can sit here
and learn something.

819
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:23,291
Sir, should I send
for Dr. Crusher?

820
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:25,125
Why, is someone ill?

821
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:28,000
Or would you rather
tell her about this, Wes?

822
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,542
If you don't mind, sir

823
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,083
I'd like to sit here
for a while.

824
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:32,417
I'll tell her later.

825
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:39,959
