00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:06,709
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43539.1.</i>

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,250
<i>We have moved into orbit</i>
<i>around Bre'el IV.</i>

3
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:10,500
<i>With the assistance</i>
<i>of the planet's</i>

4
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:11,834

5
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,291
<i>we are investigating</i>

6
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,375
<i>a catastrophic threat</i>
<i>to the population</i>

7
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:17,500
<i>from a descending</i>
<i>asteroidal moon.</i>

8
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:19,375
(<i> console beeping</i> )

9
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:20,667
The satellite's trajectory

10
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:22,709
is continuing to
deteriorate, Captain.

11
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,500
This orbit will put it
within 500 kilometers

12
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:27,083
of the planet's surface.

13
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,834
We are predicting
the atmospheric drag

14
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,250
will bring it down
on the next orbit.

15
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,542
Have you been able to find
any explanation for this?

16
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:38,041
No, Doctor. It is a most
unusual phenomenon.

17
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,041
Won't the moon disintegrate
prior to impact?

18
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,875
No. It has a ferrous
crystalline structure

19
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,917
and it will be
able to withstand
tidal forces, Captain.

20
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:48,750
Could we blow it
into pieces?

21
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,625
The total mass of
the moon would remain
the same, Commander

22
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,333
and the impact of
thousands of fragments

23
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,000
would spread destruction
over an even wider area.

24
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,875
How long before impact?

25
00:00:57,917 --> 00:00:59,375
29 hours, sir.

26
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:01,875
Projecting it somewhere
on the western continent.

27
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:05,250
That would destroy an area
800 kilometers in radius.

28
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,125
That damage would be
insignificant, Captain

29
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,291
compared to the
seismic repercussions

30
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:15,792
massive landquakes
and tsunami.

31
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:18,291
The force would raise a cloud
of dust around the planet

32
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,917
leading to a significant
temperature reduction.

33
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,709
We could be looking
at our own ice age.

34
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,333
Mr. La Forge, is there any way

35
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,000
that the<i> Enterprise</i>
could coax that satellite

36
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,458
back where it belongs?

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,750
We'd need to apply a delta-v

38
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,291
of about four kilometers
per second.

39
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,250
Even with warp power to the
tractor beam, it would mean

40
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,583
exceeding the recommended
impulse engine output

41
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,375
by at least 47%.

42
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:45,417
It would be like

43
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,083
an ant pushing a tricycle.

44
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,792
A slim chance at best.

45
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,250
Given the choice
between slim and none

46
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll take slim any day.

47
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,500
Make it so.

48
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:55,625
Lieutenant Worf, contact
all ships in this sector

49
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,500
to rendezvous and join
us in relief efforts.

50
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,000
We'll keep you advised
of our progress.

51
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,458
Picard out.

52
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,375
Can you give us
any more, Geordi?

53
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,166
Not without burning out
the tractor beam emitter.

54
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,375
The circuits are already
beyond the thermal limit.

55
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:14,375
Delta-v
is 92 meters per second.

56
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:16,041
The mass is too great.

57
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,000
We are having an effect

58
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,333
but it is
negligible.

We've done everything

a little extra.

82
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:58,166
We need more time or power,
and we're short on both.

83
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,500
I'll take a look and see
if there are any rules

84

Keep me informed.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
We know you're behind this, Q.

87
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:10,291
These aren't my colors.

88
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,291
And what are you
blathering about, Riker?

89
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,250
What kind of
twisted pleasure

90

does it give you to bring
terror into their lives?

91
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,083
Whose lives?

92
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,750
The millions of
people down there

93
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:23,000
who are watching as their
moon falls out of the sky.

94
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,041
Oh, I haven't the vaguest idea
what you're talking about

95
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,542
and I have a much
more serious problem.

96
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,959
I'm no longer a member
of the Continuum.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,500
My superiors have
decided to punish me.

98
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,834
And punish us as
well, it would seem.

99
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,625
They say I've spread chaos
through the universe

100
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:42,041
and they've stripped
me of all my powers.

101
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,875
You don't believe me, do you?

102
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:46,458
Do you think I would
humiliate myself like this?

103
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,583
If it served
your purpose, yes.

104
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,291
It's the truth.

105
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,083
I stand before you, defrocked.

106
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,000
Condemned to be a member
of this lowest of species--

107
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,875
a normal, imperfect,
lumpen human being.

108
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,417
They made you human

109
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,917
as part of your punishment?

110
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,750
No, it was my request.

111
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,667
I could have chosen to exist
as a Markoffian sea lizard

112
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,166
or a Belzoidian flea.

113
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:15,291
Anything I wished,
as long as it was mortal.

114
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,583
And since I had only
a fraction of a second to mull

115
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,375
I chose this

116
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,333
and asked them
to bring me here.

117
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,542
Why?

118
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,250
Because, in all the universe

119
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,917
you're the closest thing
I have to a friend, Jean Luc.

I would normally describe it
as being terrified.

127
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,542
How rude.

142
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,834
Fine. You want to be

00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:15,834
Absolutely.

144

Mr. Worf

146
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,166
throw him in the brig.

Delighted, Captain.

148

You can't do this
to me, Jean-Luc.

You will walk
or I will carry you.

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,166
It was a mistake.

156
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,917
I never should have
picked human.

157
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,625
I knew it the moment I said it.

158
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,834

to say nothing
of being too hot or too cold--

162

growing feeble with age,
losing my hair

163

Too bad.

Klingon. I should
have said Klingon.

168
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,625
In my heart of hearts,
I am a Klingon, Worf.

169
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,250
Sorry.

170
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,792
So, you understand, I could
never survive in confinement.

171
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:27,625
I mean, this is cruel
and unusual punishment.

172
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:30,083
The universe
has been my backyard.

173
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,625
As a fellow Klingon

174
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,125
if you would speak to
the Captain on my behalf

175
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,417
I would be
eternally grateful.

176
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,625
Which doesn't
mean as much as it
used to, I admit.

177
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,583
Be quiet!

178
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,208
Or disappear back
where you came from!

179
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,917
I<i> can't</i> disappear

180
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,500
any more than you could
win a beauty contest.

181
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,333
If I were to ask you
a<i> very</i> simple question

182
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,709
do you think you might
be able to answer it

183
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,667
without it troubling
your intellect too much?

184
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:57,667
Ready?

185
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,125
Here goes.

186
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,625
Would I permit you to
lock me away if I still

187
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,208
had all my powers?

188
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,500
You have fooled us
too often, Q.

189
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:07,875
Oh, perspicacity incarnate.

190
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,500
Please don't feel
compelled now

191
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:13,375
to tell me the story of
the boy who cried "Worf."

192
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:14,458
Computer...

193
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,750
activate force field.

194
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,041
I demand to be let out of here.

195
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,500
Do you hear me?

196
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:23,417
You will deactivate
this cell immediately.

197
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,667
Romulan!

198
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:29,583
(<i> growls quietly</i> )

199
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:33,500
I should have said Romulan--
that Klingon goat.

200
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:34,875
The question is

201
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:38,291
what sort of jaded game
is he up to this time?

202
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,792
Maybe he just
wants a big laugh.

203
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,375
He'll take Bre'el IV
to the edge of disaster

204
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:45,333
and then pull
the moon back.

205
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,667
Or he may have nothing
to do with it at all.

206
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:50,583
You honestly think Q
is telling the truth?

207
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, I agree this
is highly unlikely

208
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,041
but we have to proceed
with our current dilemma

209
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,208
as though Q is powerless
to prevent it, don't we?

210
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,834
And there he sits and
he watches us struggle.

211
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,792
I don't see that we
have any choice.

212
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:04,125
Mr. Worf, will you hail the
Bre'el IV science station?

213
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,792
They're standing by, Captain.

214
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,250
BRE'EL DOCTOR:
Yes, Captain Picard?

215
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,875
I'm sorry, but I have to report
that our first attempt

216
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,834
to restore the moon
to its proper orbit

217
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,417
has failed.

218
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

219
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:24,375
We have less than 25 hours
before impact, Captain.

220
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:25,583
Our Chief Engineer
is working on ways

221
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,291
to reinforce
the tractor beam.

222
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,166
So, there is a hope

223
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,333
but if you have
an evacuation plan...

224
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,000
We have already
started moving people

225
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,792
from the coastal areas
of the western continent.

226
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,041
We are going to make
another attempt shortly.

227
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,333
Picard, out.

228
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,417
I've got to tell you, Geordi
is not at all optimistic.

229
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,000
What the devil...?

230
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,542
Data?

231
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,166
Sensors are showing
broadband emissions

232
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,542
including berthold rays.

233
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,083
Lethal?

234
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,208
No, Commander, overall exposure
is less than 75 rems.

235
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,291
Very low intensity.

236
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,417
More like a soft
medical scan.

237
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,500
I would speculate
we are being probed.

238
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,250
By whom?

239
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,959
Sensors cannot identify
the point of origin.

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,583
It seems to be coming
from all around us.

241
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,458
Ah, you've come
to apologize.

242
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,000
How nice.

243
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,208
All is forgiven.

244
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,250
No offense taken.

245
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,208
Enough.

246
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,417
Q, what exactly is going on?

247
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,333
Oh, but how can I know
what's going on?

248
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,625
I've been in this dungeon
of yours--

249
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:51,834
alone, helpless, bored to tears.

250
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,041
We have a moon, inexplicably
falling out of orbit

251
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,959
and just now this ship was
probed with berthold radiation.

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,375
I wasn't aware of this.

253
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,125
Truthfully, Jean-Luc.

254
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,000
I've been entirely preoccupied

255
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,375
by a most frightening
experience of my own.

256
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:13,500
A couple of hours ago,
I realized that my body

257
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,750
was no longer
functioning properly.

258
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:17,250
I felt weak.

259
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,333
I could
no longer stand.

260
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,917
The life was oozing out of me.

261
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,041
I lost consciousness.

262
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,458
You fell asleep.

263
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,166
Oh-- terrifying.

264
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,917
How can you stand it
day after day?

265
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:30,917
You get used to it.

266
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,000
What other dangers

267
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,667
await me?

268
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:34,959
I'm not prepared for this.

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,208
I need guidance.

270
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,542
Q, I'm not going
to play along with this.

271
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,125
If you want to continue this
charade, you can do it alone.

272
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,458
Jean-Luc, wait.

273
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,917
This is getting on my nerves,
now that I have them.

274
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,041
You have a moon in a
deteriorating orbit.

275
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,250
I've known moons
through the universe--

276
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,208
big ones, small ones.

277
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,875
I'm an expert.

278
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:01,625
I could help you with this one--
if you let me out of here.

279
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:05,375
Q, there are millions
of lives at risk.

280
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,542
If you have the power...

281
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,417
I<i> don't</i> have any powers.

282
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:13,250
But I have the knowledge
locked up in this puny brain.

283
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:18,333
You cannot afford to not take
that advantage, can you?

284
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,875
Mr. Data, report
to Detention Cell Three.

285
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:27,000
On my way, sir.

286
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

287
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,750
Computer, remove
the force field.

288
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,834
If you are human--

289
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,667
which I seriously doubt--

290
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:39,709
you will have to work hard
to earn our trust.

291
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,709
I'm not worried
about that, Jean-Luc.

292
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,375
You only dislike me.

293
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,959
There are others in the
cosmos who truly despise me.

294
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:51,625
Mr. Data, you are hereby
assigned to Q

295
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:54,750
for the remainder
of his stay.

296
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,959
You will escort him
to Mr. La Forge in Engineering.

297
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,125
Aye, sir.

298
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,917
Can I have a
Starfleet uniform?

299
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,083
What are<i> you</i>
looking at?

300
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,333
I was considering
the possibility

301
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,208
that you are
telling the truth--

302
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,750
that you really are human.

303
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,959
It's the ghastly
truth, Mr. Data.

304
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,250
I can now stub my toe
with the best of them.

305
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,625
An irony.

306
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,542
It means that you have achieved
in disgrace

307
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,125
what I have always aspired
to be.

308
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:32,625
Humans are such
commonplace
little creatures.

309
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,083
They roam the galaxy
searching for something,

310
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,959
they know not what.

311
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The human race has
an enduring desire
for knowledge

312
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,750
and for new opportunities
to improve itself.

313
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,750
Well, there's certainly
room for improvement

314
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:45,959
but the truth is, Data,
they are a minor species
in the grand scheme--

315
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,625
not worth your envy.

316
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:48,792
Oh, I do not feel envy.

317
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,166
Well, that's good.

318
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,625
I feel nothing at all.

319
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,583
That is part
of my dilemma.

320
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,542
I have the curiosity
of humans

321
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,834
but there are questions

322
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,667
that I will never
have the answers to--

323
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,792
what it is like
to laugh or... or cry

324
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,959
or to experience
any human emotions.

325
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,500
Hmm.

326
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,375
Well, if you ask me,
these human emotions

327
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,583
are not what they're
cracked up to be.

328
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,417
Hmm.

329
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,959
The moon will hit
its perigee in ten hours.

330
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,583
Now, we match its trajectory,
increase emitter coolant rate

331
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,250
so that we can apply continuous
warp-equivalent power nine

332
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,667
to the tractor beam.

333
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:24,625
We can push it
for nearly seven hours

334
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:27,417
and I<i> think</i>
that just might do it.

335
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,500
But there's a problem.

336
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,083
The<i> Enterprise</i> will be
dangerously close

337
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,583
to the atmosphere.

338
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,625
That's the problem.

339
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,834
This is incredible.

340
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,250
You see something here, Q?

341
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,333
I think I just
hurt my back.

342
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,250
I'm feeling pain.

343
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,917
I don't like it.

344
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,333
What's the right
thing to say?

345
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,667
"Ow"?

346
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:45,750
Ow.
Ow.

347
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,375
Ow!

348
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:49,458
I can't
straighten up.

349
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,250
Medical assistance
to Engineering.

350
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,125
Q, I've got a few people
down on Bre'el IV

351
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,875
who are going to be hurt...
Yes, yes, yes.

352
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:57,417
Your marvelous plan will not
only tear the moon to pieces

353
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,083
but your precious ship as well.

354
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,875
You got a better idea?

355
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:03,542
Well, I would certainly begin
by examining the cause

356
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,083
and not the symptom.

357
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,959
We've already done that, Q,
and there's no way to...

358
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,291
This is
obviously

359
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,959
the result of a large
celestial object

360
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,542
passing through
at near right angles

361
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,625
to the plane
of the star system--

362
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,041
probably a black hole.

363
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,041
DATA:
Can you recommend

364
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,792
a way to counter
the effect?

365
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:20,959
Simple. Change the
gravitational constant
of the universe.

366
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,375
What?

367
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,291
Change the gravitational
constant of the universe

368
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,542
thereby altering the
mass of the asteroid.

369
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,750
Redefine gravity.

370
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,250
And how am I supposed
to do that?

371
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,500
You just do it.

372
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:33,125
Oh! Where's that
doctor, anyway?

373
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,667
Geordi is trying to say

374
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:36,875
that changing the gravitational
constant of the universe

375
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,375
is beyond our capabilities.

376
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,500
Oh.

377
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:44,375
Well, in that case,
never mind.

378
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:47,458
Ah, Dr. Crusher.

379
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
I see Starfleet
has shipped you
back into exile.

380
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,709
Q says he has
hurt his back.

381
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,333
Uh-huh.

382
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,041
Well, if I didn't see it
with my own eyes

383
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,959
I wouldn't believe it.

384
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,834
According to this,
he has classic back trauma--

385
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,083
muscle spasms.

386
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,875
I've been under a lot
of pressure lately.

387
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:11,333
Family problems.

388
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,500
Mm. Well, don't expect
too much sympathy from me.

389
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,917
You have been a pain
in our backside often enough.

390
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,208
Ah! Oh.

391
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,500
Your bedside manner
is admirable, Doctor.

392
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,625
I'm sure your patients
recover quickly...

393
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,375
just to get away from you.

394
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:26,208
Oh!

395
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,792
You know, this might work.

396
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:29,083
We can't change

397
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,709
the gravitational
constant of the universe

398
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,583
but if we wrap a low-level
warp field around that moon

399
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,208
we could reduce<i> its</i>
gravitational constant--

400
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,166
make it lighter,
so we<i> can</i> push it.

401
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,542
Glad I could help.

402
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,458
Ow... I think.

403
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,875
Now what?

404
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:48,041
There's something wrong
with my stomach.

405
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,583
It hurts?

406
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,041
It's making noises.

407
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,875
Maybe you're hungry.

408
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,000
I've never eaten before.

409
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,667
What do I ask for?

410
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:05,375
The choice of meal
is determined by
individual taste.

411
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,125
What do you like?

412
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,417
Although I do not
require sustenance

413
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,667
I occasionally
ingest semi-organic
nutrient suspension

414
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:15,041
in a silicon-based
liquid medium.

415
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,709
Is it good?

416
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,417
It would be more
appropriate to say

417
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,000
it is good for<i> me</i>

418
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,000
as it lubricates
my bio-functions.

419
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,208
That doesn't sound
very appealing.

420
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,458
What else is there?

421
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,375
A wide variety of items.

422
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:29,625
The replicator can make
anything you desire.

423
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:33,291
How do I know
what I desire?

424
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,875
I have observed that
the selection of food

425
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,166
is often influenced

426
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,250
by the mood of the
person ordering.

427
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,583
I'm in a dreadful mood.

428
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,125
Get me something
appropriate.

429
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,375
When Counselor Troi
is unhappy

430
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,250
she usually eats
something chocolate.

431
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,625
Chocolate?

432
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,750
Mm-hmm.

433
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,875
A chocolate sundae,
for example.

434
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,375
Although I do not speak
from personal experience

435
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:02,417
I have seen it have a
profound psychological impact.

436
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,834
I'll have ten
chocolate sundaes.

437
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,333
Ten?

438
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,500
I have never
seen anyone eat

439
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,750
<i>ten</i> chocolate
sundaes.

440
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,792
I'm in a really bad mood.

441
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:15,291
And since I've never
eaten before, I should
be... very hungry.

442
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,959
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

443
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,083
This is not a moment
I've been looking forward to.

444
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:36,041
I hear they drummed you
out of the Continuum.

445
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,709
I like to think of it
as a significant career change.

446
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,458
Just one of the boys, eh?

447
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,583
One of the boys

448
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,375
with an IQ of 2,005.

449
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,291
The Captain and many of the
crew are not yet convinced

450
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,500
he is truly human.

451
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:53,125
Really?

452
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,375
(<i> yells in pain</i> )

453
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:05,000
Seems human enough
to me.

454
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,417
This is
a dangerous creature.

455
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,875
You have no idea.

456
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:09,250
Why Picard would make her
a member of the crew

457
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,125
and not me...

458
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,625
It must be terribly
frightening for you to
be totally defenseless

459
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:18,208
after all of those centuries
of being omnipotent.

460
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm warning you, I still
have friends in high places.

461
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,125
Frightening one race
after the other

462
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,375
teasing them like
frightened animals

463
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:29,500
and you enjoying every moment
of your victims' fears.

464
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:33,083
From now on, I'll do
missionary work, okay?

465
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,500
That would be a most
noble cause, Q.

466
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,125
You could learn a lot
from this one.

467
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,375
Sure-- the robot who teaches
the course in humanities.

468
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,417
I am an android,
not a robot.

469
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,583
I beg your pardon.

470
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,792
I'd enjoy that.

471
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:45,959
And you better get used to it.

472
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What?

473
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,166
Begging.

474
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,917
You're a pitiful excuse
for a human.

475
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,166
The only way
you're going to survive

476
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,458
is on the charity
of others.

477
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:05,542
Oh, I'm not hungry.

478
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,125

You tormented them.

00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,458
One creature's torment is
another creature's delight.

You knew this would happen,
didn't you?

536
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,125
One can never anticipate
the Calamarain.

537
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:50,166
They're very intelligent,
but very flighty.

538
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,709
Yes, but you
must have

539
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,917
so many enemies.

540
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:57,625
Certainly you knew
that if once you became mortal

541
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:01,000
some of them might look you up.

542
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,250
It had occurred to me.

543
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:03,625
Mm-hmm.

544
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,500
And for all your protestations
of "friendship"

545
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:09,667
your real reason
for being here is protection.

546
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:11,834
(<i> chuckles</i> )

547
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,250
You're very smart, Jean-Luc.

548
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,458
But I know human beings.

549
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,583
They're all sopping over

550
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:20,166
with compassion
and forgiveness.

551
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:24,792
They can't wait
to absolve almost any offense.

552
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,750
It's an inherent weakness
of the breed.

553
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,834
On the contrary,
it is a strength.

554
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:32,041
You call it what you will,
but I think you'll protect me

555
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,500
even though I've tormented you
now and again.

556
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,500
Fighting off all the species
which you have insulted

557
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,000
would be a full-time mission.

558
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,834
That's not the one
I signed up for.

559
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,667
Indeed.

560
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:44,291
Human or not,
I want no part of you.

561
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,250
We will deposit you
at the first starbase.

562
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,834
Let them deal with you.

563
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:50,625
Uh-uh, but I could be
a valuable member of the team.

564
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:51,625
I'm human.

565
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,083
I can learn.

566
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,000
He has provided important
theoretical guidance

567
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:58,000
for Geordi's analysis of the
Bre'el satellite, Captain.

568
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:01,166
It seems you have
an advocate, Q.

569
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,000
I am merely stating the fact,
Counselor.

570
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:06,667
Mr. La Forge, your status?

571
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:08,166
I've been putting together
a program

572
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:10,709
to extend the forward lobe
of the warp field.

573
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,458
The field coils aren't designed
to envelope such a large volume

574
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,083
but I'm attempting to modify
their alignment parameters.

575
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,875
DATA:
Maintaining field integrity
will be difficult, Geordi.

576
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,375
Well, I'm pretty sure
that we can do it manually.

577
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:25,041
The moon will come
to its perigee in 14 minutes.

578
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:28,208
Mr. Data, you will escort Q
to Engineering.

579
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,166
You will assist Mr. La Forge.

580
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:33,458
Mr. Worf, hail the Bre'el IV
science station.

581
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,625
Aye, sir.

582
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,917
Picard thinks I can't cut it
on his starship.

583
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,000
I can do anything

584
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,083
his little trained
minions can do.

585
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,834
I do not perceive your
skills to be in doubt, Q.

586
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,875
The Captain is merely
concerned with your ability

587
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:52,875
to successfully interact with
"his little trained minions."

588
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:56,583
Human interpersonal
relationships are
more complex.

589
00:25:56,625 --> 00:26:00,125
Your experience may not have
adequately prepared you.

590
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:03,291
I'm not interested in human
interpersonal relationships.

591
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,458
I just want to prove to Picard
that I'm indispensable.

592
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,083
Engineering.

593
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:14,834
To function aboard
a starship, or in
any human activity

594
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:17,208
you must learn to
form relationships.

595
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,333
(<i> sighing</i> ):
It's so hard.

596
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,917
And of more
immediate importance

597
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:23,417
is your ability
to work within groups.

598
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,041
I'm not good in groups.

599
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,250
It's difficult
to work in a group

600
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,792
when you're omnipotent.

601
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:34,041
The tides reached 10 meters
on the last orbit.

602
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,625
They are already beginning
to swell again.

603
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:40,000
We have a lot of frightened
people down here, Captain.

604
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:42,375
Your moon has begun moving
towards its perigee.

605
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,041
We're preparing
to make our attempt.

606
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:47,250
Our population has
already taken shelter

607
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:51,125
but I'm afraid no shelter
will be adequate if you fail

608
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:55,583
especially for the people
on the western continent.

609
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,291
Whatever the results

610
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:01,375
we know you've
done your best, Picard.

611
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:03,417
It's appreciated.

612
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,000
We'll keep you advised, Doctor.

613
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,000
Picard out.

614
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,417
Captain, sensors are picking up

615
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:10,542
an increased energy output
from the Calamarain.

616
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,500
La Forge to Bridge.

617
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:15,625
The moon has reached
its minimum orbital distance.

618
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,959
It's time, Captain.

619
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,375
We'll have
to lower shields.

620
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:19,959
Proceed.

621
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,208
Mr. Worf, keep a close eye
on Q's friends out there.

622
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,625
Understood.

623
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,375
All right, everyone, this is
what we're going to be doing...

624
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:31,834
Q, everybody already knows

625
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,583
what they're going to do,
except for you.

626
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:34,750
Now, here's
what I need...

627
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:36,208
La Forge, obviously,
my knowledge

628
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,000
and experience
far exceeds yours

629
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,583
by about a billion times.

630
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,250
So, if you'll just step
aside gracefully.

631
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:45,792
Q, Your experience will
be most valuable to me

632
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,792
if you can manually
control the field integrity.

633
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,041
Don't be foolish.

634
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,667
That would be a waste
of my talents.

635
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:52,583
Q, get to the controls
or get the hell out of here!

636
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,000
Data, you're my liaison
to the Bridge.

637
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,500
I'll need you with me.

638
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:03,375
Who does he think he
is, giving me orders?

639
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,625
Geordi thinks
he is in command here

640
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:08,041
and he is correct.

641
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:14,834
Engineering, holding at station
keeping, range 640 meters.

642
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,041
DATA:
Containment fields
to flight tolerance.

643
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:19,709
Warp core to 90%.

644
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,125
Engage field coils,
tractor beam to stand-by.

645
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,709
Field output?

646
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,417
<i>Field output?</i>

647
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,500
(<i> bored</i> ):
Two-seventeen.

648
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,083
Impulse engines to full.

649
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,208
Ready to engage tractor beam.

650
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,166
Lowering shields,
engage tractor beam.

651
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:44,083
Extending warp field forward.

652
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,917
PICARD:
Engineering, is that
the forward limit?

653
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:49,417
Yes, Captain, we are unable
to encompass the entire moon.

654
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:50,834
Do you recommend
that we proceed?

655
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,166
The two parts of the moon

656
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,625
will have different
inertial densities.

657
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,417
Stand by, Captain.

658
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,500
I can adjust the field symmetry
to compensate.

659
00:28:58,542 --> 00:28:59,875
I doubt it.

660
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:02,208
You don't know
what this ship can do, mister.

661
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,583
Yes, Captain,
I still believe it'll work.

662
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,750
Increasing power to warp field
and tractor beam.

663
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:09,250
And if you're wrong
the moon will crumble

664
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,166
due to subspace compression.

665
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,291
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

666
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,625
Shut up, Q.

667
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:15,959
I will not be spoken to
in this manner!

668
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,667
Data.

669
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:20,917
Q, I strongly suggest
that you cooperate.

670
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,792
Inertial mass of
the moon is decreasing

671
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:30,458
to approximately
2.5 million metric tons.

672
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,000
It<i> is</i> working.

673
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,542
We<i> can</i> move it.

674
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:34,917
Firing impulse engines.

has moved .3 percent.

676
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,291

677
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,291
Emergency!
Shields up.

678
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,875
Disengage

679
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:49,208

00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,500
Geordi, can you direct
anymore power to the shields?

691
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:22,834
We need all the power we have

692
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,667
to get out of the atmosphere,
Commander.

00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,583
What can you do for him?

711
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,417
We can try to discharge
and reset the motor pathways

712
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:21,083
recouple the
autonomic nodes...

713
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:23,291
There's overpressure
in his fluidic systems.

714
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,667
Thermal shock.

715
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:26,709
If he was mortal,
he'd be dead.

716
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,417
Well, let's not overstate
the matter here, Doctor.

717
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:31,125
I'm mortal and I survived.

718
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,750
Oh, the cheers
are overwhelming.

719
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:37,083
Q, you exceed

720
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,208
your own standards
of self-preoccupation.

721
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,417
You have no concern
for an officer

722
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,500
who may have
saved your life.

723
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:44,667
He's strong.
He'll survive.

724
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:46,625
LA FORGE:
Osmotic pressure
still rising.

725
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:49,291
Maybe we can bypass
the flow regulator.

726
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,959
It would be helpful if everybody
just got out of here now.

727
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,417
Stay with Q.

728
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:03,000
Geordi?
Hmm?

729
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:06,083
The moon's trajectory.

730
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:09,417
All we did was buy ourselves
another orbit-- at most.

731
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:10,625
We can try again

732
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:11,834
when the moon comes
back to its perigee.

733
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,250
And when we drop our shields

734
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,667
the Calamarains
go after Q again.

735
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:17,208
Commander, he's
not worth it.

736
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,458
(<i> door chimes</i> )

737
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,834
Come.

738
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,500
You're right, of course.

739
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:33,834
I'm extraordinarily
selfish

740
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:36,750
but it has served me
so well in the past.

741
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:39,542
It will not
serve you here.

742
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,041
Don't be so hard
on me, Jean-Luc.

743
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,250
You've been a mortal
all your life.

744
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,083
You know all about dying.

745
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,709
I've never given it
a second thought.

746
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,834
Or a first one,
for that matter.

747
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,250
I could have been killed.

748
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:54,750
If it hadn't been for Data

749
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,542
and that one brief
delay he created

750
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,667
I would have
been gone.

751
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:01,709
No more me.

752
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,792
And no one would have missed me

753
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:04,458
would they?

754
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:10,583
Data may have sacrificed
himself for me.

755
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,333
Why?

756
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,709
That is his special nature.

757
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,125
He learned the lessons
of humanity well.

758
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:21,458
When I ask myself if I would
have done the same for him

759
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,667
and I am forced to answer no

760
00:33:25,709 --> 00:33:30,000
I feel... I feel ashamed.

761
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,542
Q, I am not
your father confessor.

762
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:35,583
You will receive
no absolution from me.

763
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:38,458
You have brought nothing but
pain and suffering to this crew.

764
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,875
And I am still
not entirely convinced

765
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:45,709
that all this isn't your latest
attempt at a puerile joke.

766
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,542
It is a joke, a joke on me--

767
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:51,875
joke of the universe,
the king who would be man.

768
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,625
As I learn
more and more

769
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,875
what it is to be human,
I am more and more convinced

770
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,625
that I would never
make a good one.

771
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,250
I don't have what it takes.

772
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:04,291
Without my powers,
I'm frightened of everything.

773
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,458
I'm a coward.

774
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,083
And I'm miserable.

775
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:11,750
And I can't go on this way.

776
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:16,583
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

777
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,959
He's going
to be all right.

778
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,375
LA FORGE:
We're re-calibrating

779
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:31,083
his language circuits,
so he can't talk yet.

780
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:36,208
There are creatures
in the universe

781
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,250
who would consider you the
ultimate achievement, android.

782
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:45,750
No feelings, no emotions,
no pain--

783
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,542
and yet you covet
those qualities of humanity.

784
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,417
Believe me,
you're missing nothing.

785
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:58,500
But if it means anything to you,
you're a better human than I.

786
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,208
Where's the main shuttle bay?

787
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,333
Main shuttle bay is located
on deck four.

788
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:15,625
Take me there.

789
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,250
(<i> console beeping</i> )

790
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:22,000
Captain, an unscheduled shuttle
has just been launched.

791
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,542
On main viewer.

792
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,583
Hailing frequency.

793
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,709
Frequency's open.

794
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,875
Shuttle occupant,
identify yourself.

795
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:38,000
Don't try and talk me out of it,
Jean-Luc.

796
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,834
Q, return to the ship
immediately.

797
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,792
I just can't get used
to following orders.

798
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:46,709
Captain, the plasma cloud
is moving toward the shuttle.

799
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,375
It's easier this way.

800
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:51,333
They won't bother you
after I'm gone.

801
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,500
Engineering, prepare
to extend shields.

802
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:56,166
Please, don't fall back
on your tired cliché

803
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:59,792
of charging to the rescue
just in the nick of time.

804
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:02,083
I don't want to be rescued.

805
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:05,291
My life as a human being
has been a dismal failure.

806
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:08,291
Perhaps my death
will have a little dignity.

807
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,083
Q, there is no dignity
in this suicide.

808
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,375
Yes, I suppose you're right.

809
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:15,208
Death of a coward, then,
so be it.

810
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,250
But as a human,
I would have died of boredom.

811
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:38,458
This goes against
my better judgment.

812
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,625
Transporter Room Three,
lock on to Shuttle One.

813
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,000
Beam it back into its bay.

814
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,250
Aye, Captain.

815
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:48,166
It's a perfectly
good shuttlecraft.

816
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,125
Captain, unable to transport.

817
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,291
For some reason, I can't lock on
to the shuttlecraft.

818
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,417
Worf, are you sensing

819
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,041
any interference
from the Calamarain?

820
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,458
No, sir, but they are still
moving toward the shuttle.

821
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,125
Geordi, extend shields
around Shuttle One.

822
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:03,667
Extending shields.

823
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:05,542
Commander,
the shields are frozen.

824

Cause?

825
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:09,875

Lock on tractor beam.

827
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:16,000
Tractor beam is not functioning,
either.

828

Ah!

835
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,500
Sacrificing yourself
for these humans?

836
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:41,083
Do I detect
a<i> little</i> selfless act?

837
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,417
You flatter me.

838
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,917
I was only trying to put
a quick end

839
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:46,125
to a miserable existence.

840
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:48,166
(<i> groans</i> )

841
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:49,417
What a dreadful color.

842
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,875
Yeah.

843
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,542
What are you doing here?

844
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:55,583
Oh, I've been
keeping track of you.

845
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,333
I always thought
you were in my corner.

846
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,875
Ah, no, no.

847
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:01,709
See, actually, I was the one
who got you kicked out.

848
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,000
You know, you're
incorrigible, Q.

849
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,166
You're a lost cause.

850
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,208
I can't go
to a single solar system

851
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,208
without having
to... apologize for you

852
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,500
and I'm tired of it.

853
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:11,875
I wasn't the one who misplaced

854
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:14,166
the entire
Deltived asteroid belt.

855
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,417
Hey, this isn't about me.

856
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,500
I got better places to be.

857
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:20,000
But somebody had to keep
an eye on you to make sure

858
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:23,333
you still didn't find a way
to cause trouble.

859
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,792
Even as a member
of this...

860
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:28,750
hmm... limited species.

861
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:31,208
Well, I... I hope
I've been entertaining you.

862
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,083
Barely.

863
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,500
But... I find these humans
rather interesting.

864
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:40,709
I'm beginning to understand
what you see in them.

865
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,083
After all the things
that you've done

866
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:44,750
they're still intent
on keeping you safe.

867
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:46,917
A genetic weakness
of the race.

868
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:48,583
And they're still at it.

869
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,750
They just tried to... mmm...

870
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:54,000
beam you up, back
whatever it is they call it.

871
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,208
Really.

872
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,166
I stopped them.

873
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,291
Well, if the Calamarains
hurry up and finish me off

874
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,959
we can get you back
on your way.

875
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,709
Afraid I had to put
them on hold, too.

876
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:08,792
You see, there's still this
matter of the selfless act.

877
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:10,458
Now, you and I both know
that the Calamarain

878
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,625
would have
eventually destroyed

879
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:14,166
the<i> Enterprise</i>
to get to you

880
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:17,083
and that's really
why you left, right?

881
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,333
It was a teeny bit selfless,
wasn't it?

882
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,166
Oh! Yeah, and
there's my problem.

883
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,500
See, I can't go back
to the Continuum

884
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:23,709
and tell them
that you committed

885
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,000
a selfless act
just before the end.

886
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,834
If I do, there's going
to be questions

887
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:29,625
there's going to be explanations
<i>for centuries.</i>

888
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,959
I've learned my lesson, Q.

889
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,709
Remember who
you're talking to--

890
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:39,709
all knowing, all seeing.

891
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

892
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,667
Hmm, fine.

893
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:45,417
Oh... you got your powers back.

894
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,917
Try and stay out of trouble.

895
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:58,417
So they wanted to destroy me,
did they?

896
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:06,041
If you think I tormented you
in the past, my little friends

897
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,750
wait until you see
what I do with you now.

898
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:10,458
Q...?

899
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,417
I was just seeing
if you were still watching.

900
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:21,750
Captain,
the aliens have disappeared

901
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:23,208
and so has the shuttle.

902
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,417
Scan the sector.

903
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:26,542
I have, sir.

904
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:30,917
Well... I suppose
that is the end of Q.

905
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,542
<i>Au contraire,</i>
<i>mon capitaine!</i>

906
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:41,000
He's back!

907
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:43,291
(<i> playing mariachi music</i> )

908
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:58,917
I'm forgiven.

909
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,625
My brothers and sisters
of the Continuum

910
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,959
have taken me back.

911
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,875
I'm immortal again,
omnipotent again.

912
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:07,208
Swell.

913
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,792
Don't fret, Riker.

914
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,125
My good fortune
is your good fortune.

915
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:17,750
I don't need your fantasy women.

916
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:19,291
Oh, you're so stolid.

917
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:20,917
You weren't like that
before the beard.

918
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

919
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,500
Very well.

920
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:31,625
Q!

921
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,417
But I feel like celebrating.

922
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,709
I don't!

923
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,041
All right.

924
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:43,208
All of it.

925
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,709
Oh...

926
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:51,417
Now, at the risk
of being rude...

927
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,709
Yes, once again,
I've overstayed
my welcome.

928
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,834
As a human,
I was ill-equipped to thank you

929
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:59,875
but, as myself, you have
my everlasting gratitude.

930
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,041
Until next time.

931
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:07,709
Ah, but, before I go,
there's a debt I wish to repay

932
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,959
to my professor
of the humanities.

933
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,250
Data, I've decided

934
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:14,500
to give you something
very, very special.

935
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:16,500
If your intention is
to make me human, Q...

936
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:17,959
No, no, no, no, no.

937
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,709
I would never curse you
by making you human.

938
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,917
Think of it...
as a going-away present.

939
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:38,375
(<i> laughing uproariously</i> )

940
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:45,375
LA FORGE:
Data...?

941
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:57,542
Data, why are
you laughing?

942
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,291
It...

943
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:11,792
I do not know.

944
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:15,250
But it was a wonderful...
feeling.

945
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:16,500
(<i> console beeping</i> )

946
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:20,333
Captain, Bre'el IV
is hailing us.

947
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:21,792
On screen,
Lieutenant.

948
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,625
Captain Picard,
you've done it.

949
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:28,125
I'm sorry?

950
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:31,333
The moon-- it's back
to its normal orbit.

951
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,959
However you did
it, thank you.

952
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:39,750
Let's see it, Worf.

953
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,041
Mr. Data, your analysis?

954
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,792
The moon's altitude
is 55,000 kilometers.

955
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:52,834
Projected orbit is circular.

956
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,709
There is no further danger
to the planet.

957
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:06,291
Ensign, set course
for Station Nigala IV.

958
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,709
Aye, sir.

959
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:19,625
Perhaps there's a... residue
of humanity in Q after all.

960
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:25,667
Ensign, en...

961
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:28,917
Don't bet
on it, Picard.
