1
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:06,959
Aw!

00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:08,291
(<i> door chimes</i> )

3
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:11,041
Enter. Enter!

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,041
Worf, they're going to be
here any minute.

5
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,125
I am having problems.

6
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,875
If I didn't
know you better

7
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,125
I'd say that you were
procrastinating.

8
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,959
Klingons do not
procrastinate.

9
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:25,709
It is a tactical delay.

10
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,250
You have to spend
about five minutes

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,875
greeting the Iyaarans
when they get here

12
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,375
and maybe an hour
making small talk

13
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,583
at this reception.

14
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,041
I'm the one who
has to escort them

15
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,500
around the ship for
the next three days.

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,959
I do not enjoy
these diplomatic situations.

17
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:39,542
It's all part of
being in Starfleet.

18
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:40,750
There.

19
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,875
I do not see
why it is necessary

20
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,500
to wear these
ridiculous uniforms.

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,041
Protocol.

22
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,125
They look like dresses.

23
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:57,000
That is an incredibly
outmoded and sexist attitude.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,166
I'm surprised at you.

25
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,709
Besides,
you look good in a dress.

26
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:16,291
PICARD:
What's keeping them?

27
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,375
Ah, you're just in time.

28
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,834
They're about to disembark.

29
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,834
Ambassador Loquel,
Ambassador Byleth,

30
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,834
I am Captain Picard.

31
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,083
Welcome on board
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

32
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,000
It is our pleasure
to be here, Captain.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,959
It is an honor
to be the site

34
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,166
of the first
cultural exchange

35
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,041
between
the Iyaaran people

36
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,041
and the Federation.

37
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,166
Yes, the next seven days

38
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,709
should prove
most illuminating.

39
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,500
Allow me
to introduce Voval.

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
He'll be taking you back
to our homeworld.

41
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,875
How do you do?

42
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,709
I'm looking forward
very much

43
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,959
to meeting with
the Premier of Iyar.

44
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,917
There will be a reception
held in your honor

45
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,417
when you will meet
the rest of my senior staff.

46
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:04,333
I, of course, shall be
on my way to your homeworld

47
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,667
but I shall be leaving you
in the safe hands

48
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,667
of my most
experienced officers.

49
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,917
Lieutenant Worf,
of the Klingon Empire

50
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,375
is my Head of Security.

51
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,917
He will be in charge
of your safety

52
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:15,625
while you're on board.

53
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,917
Counselor Deanna Troi,
of the planet Betazed

54
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:22,083
will be your personal
liaison officer,
Ambassador Loquel.

55
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,041
Ambassador, it's
an honor to meet you.

56
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,959
Would you like to see
your quarters

57
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,458
before we attend
the reception?

58
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,083
Please.

59
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,250
Ambassador Byleth,

60
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,875
this is Commander
William Riker,

61
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,125
my First Officer,
from the planet Earth.

62
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,417
He has been
assigned to you.

63
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,792
I want this one.

64
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,291
Well, Commander Riker
is a skilled diplomat

65
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,041
with wide experience
in interspecies contact.

66
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,917
I'm sure, I'm sure.

67
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:53,000
But I have decided.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,208
I want this...

69
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,041
Lieutenant Worf.

70
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:00,083
Well, that will be,
uh... just fine.

71
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:02,542
Mr. Worf?

72
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,917
Yes.

73
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,333
Yes, Ambassador, it
would be my pleasure...

74
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,709
Yes, yes,
enough of that.

75
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,000
Show me
to my quarters.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,333
This way.

77
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,166
Good luck.

78
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,125
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

79
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:04,125
<i>These are the voyages</i>

80
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,000

(<i> quiet conversation</i> )

85
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,041
So, first thing
tomorrow

86
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,625
I thought I'd take
you on a tour

87
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,125
of the operational
centers

88
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,792
and residential decks
of the ship.

89
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,500
And then we could
spend some time

90
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,625
discussing the cultural
underpinnings of your society.

91
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,583
Are you going to eat?

92
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,667
Excuse me?

93
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:38,792
You have no food
on your plate.

94
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:39,959
Are you going
to eat?

95
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,208
Oh, um, actually,
I was waiting

96
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,583
till we got to
the desserts.

97
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,542
Desserts--
what is this?

98
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,750
Oh, it's something we eat
after the main course.

99
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,500
It's usually very sweet.

100
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
It's usually
very bad for you.

101
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,667
We eat it purely
for pleasure.

102
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,208
If you ask me,

103
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,834
it's the best
part of any meal.

104
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,834
My people eat
only for nourishment.

105
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:02,625
Oh, well, um, let
me introduce you

106
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,500
to some of my favorites.

107
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,208
This is peach cobbler
with whipped cream,

108
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,959
Tarvokian powder cake,

109
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,542
and this is my favorite--

110
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:15,125
Ktarian chocolate puff.

111
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,291
I don't know exactly
what's inside

112
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,083
but I think it's made

113
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,792
with 17 varieties
of chocolate.

114
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,583
That is...

115
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,208
That is...

116
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,709
Delicious?

117
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,583
Delicious.

118
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,125
Ambassador, I think

119
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,834
we're going to get
along very well.

120
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:36,083
Shall we?

121
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,875
This is unacceptable.

122
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,917
I am sorry you do
not care for our...

123
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,667
Bring me new food.

124
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:59,542
I require a higher protein
and enzymatic content.

125
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:00,709
Ambassador...
Yes?

126
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,000
it's the custom,
usually,

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,417
in a situation
like this

128
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:04,750
for us to serve
ourselves.

129
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,709
It's called a buffet.

130
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,333
Bring me new food.

131
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,041
Ambassador...

132
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,125
Doctor, it is all right.

133
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,625
I am happy to
bring more food.

Fine.

137
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,166
I have heard

138
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,750
that in moments
of diplomatic tension

139
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,834
it is often helpful

140
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:45,458
to find elements
of commonality.

141
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:51,083
Ambassador Byleth is demanding,
temperamental and rude.

142
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,542
You share all of those
qualities in abundance.

143
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:56,792
Perhaps you should
try to build on
your similarities.

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,041
So...

145
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,333
I understand
that your homeworld

146
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,375

No.

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Voval, I'm going
to try and get help.

186
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,417
Do you understand?

187
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:39,291
Now, try to stay
conscious

188
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,834
and don't leave
the shuttle.

189
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,041
There's some kind
of plasma energy

190
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,917
out on the surface.

191
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

192

(<i> gasps</i> )

193
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,041
The engineering section
encompasses 12 decks

194
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,458
of the secondary hull.

195
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,083
Deck 42 contains

196
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,834
the antimatter
storage facility...

197
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,166
What is the mass-flow rate

198
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,917
of the antimatter
replenishment stream

199
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,250
to the containment pods?

200
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,542
Excuse me?

201
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:11,709
The antimatter
replenishment rate--

202
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,000
what is it?

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,291
I am not certain...

204
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:19,208
Perhaps there is
somebody here who
does know the answer.

205
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,250
You!

206
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,458
Are<i> you</i> smarter than this one?

207
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,792
(<i> clears throat</i> )

208
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,083
Why do you ask?

209
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,500
Never mind.

210
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,083
I wish to see
the Bussard collectors.

211
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,166
Take me to them.

212
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,375
This way.

(<i> chuckling</i> )

214
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,834
This deck is devoted mainly
to stellar cartography,

215
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,792
biological research
and astrophysics.

216
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,375
We have over 1,000
people on board...

217
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,917
Are you sure you don't want
some of this...

218
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,834
this<i> papalla</i> juice?

219
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:57,917
No, thank you.

220
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,208
I'm still recovering

221
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,417
from all those
desserts last night.

222
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,417
Are you sure?

223
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:04,083
It is very delicious.

224
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,750
I'm sure.

225
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,083
Please. Please.

226
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,959
You've... you've
been so kind.

227
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,250
Please.

228
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:21,000
Yum.

229
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,208
Next, we're going
to deck eight,

230
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,375
which is really
interesting

231
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,667
because it's not
really finished.

232
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,166
It's sort of
a multipurpose...

233
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,709
Sometimes when we need
an extra lab or...

234
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,500
Ambassador?

235
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,375
What is this?

236
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,041
It's a child.

237
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,709
Child?!

238
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:52,041
Children are our offspring.

239
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,667
They're our young.

240
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:56,792
They grow into adults
over a period of many years.

241
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,917
They grow into beings like us.

242
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:00,250
Offspring.

243
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,333
Ambassador, I'm curious.

244
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,834
How does<i> your</i>
species procreate?

245
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:08,375
Postcellular compounding.

246
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,417
We emerge from the
natal pod fully grown.

247
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,208
I see.

248
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,834
Do you have a name?

249
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,542
Eric.

250
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,583
Eric.

251
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,750
Do you like... dessert?

252
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,792
May I give Eric

253
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,959
some dessert?

254
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,083
That sounds like
a wonderful idea.

255
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,625
Come on, Eric.

Who's there?

260
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,000
What do you want?

261
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,792
Who are you?

262
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,375
Who are you?

263
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,417
Shh.

264
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,625
No, wait! Stop!

265
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,000
There was someone else
in the shuttlecraft with me.

266
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,792
The pilot-- he's injured.

267
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,250
He needs your help.

268
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,208
He's dead.

00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,375

272
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,166
Thank you.

(<i> groaning</i> )

274
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,333
This is a Terellian
cargo freighter, isn't it?

275
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,959
Is this your ship?

276
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,625
You one of the crew?

277
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,041
No.

278
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,625
I was a passenger.

279
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,917
We crashed.

280
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,375
How many people survived?

281
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:27,291
Were you the only one?

282
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,959
Well, you're certainly
not a Terellian,

283
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:34,917
unless you've lost
two of your arms.

284
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,959
What's your name?

285
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,875
I'm Jean-Luc Picard.

286
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,834
I'm a Starfleet officer.

287
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,792
Anna.

288
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,166
Anna?

289
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:57,333
Are there other people
on this planet?

290
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,333
How long have you been here?

291
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,125
I don't know.

292
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,375
You can't see
the sun from here.

293
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,667
I've lost track of all time.

294
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,000
What was the date
when you crashed?

295
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:29,208
Stardate 40812.

296
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,166
Seven years.

297
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:35,917
Years?

298
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,667
Anna...

299
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:42,500
Anna, wait a minute.

300
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,834
Seven years?

301
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:48,625
I... I thought one...

302
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,625
maybe two.

303
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,083
How could it be seven?

304
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,834
Anna...
Anna, listen to me.

305
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,250
Listen.

306
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,750
On the shuttle,
there is a lot of equipment

307
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,291
that will have survived
the crash.

308
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,375
We can use it
to contact Starfleet.

309
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,834
They'll send a ship for us.

310
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:07,917
We can leave.

311
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:09,125
Leave?

312
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,834
Yes.
Both of us.

313
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:15,625
Now, if you will help me
to get to the shuttle...

314
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,667
Oh!

315
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,625
Don't move.

316
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,667
It's bad.

317
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:24,542
Don't worry.
I won't move.

318
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:28,625
You have
three broken ribs.

319
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,458
The restrictor device

320
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:35,542
will hold the
bones in place.

321
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,208
Let them...

322
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,667
Hmm...

323
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,500
Let them knit?

324
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:49,917
It's been so long
since I talked to anyone.

325
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:52,625
I used to talk...

326
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,875
to myself.

327
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,709
But then I thought
that it might mean

328
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,291
I was crazy.

329
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,583
So I... I stopped talking.

330
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:08,917
It'll be a while
before you can walk.

331
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:12,417
Then, perhaps you could go
to the shuttle

332
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,542
and bring the equipment
back here.

333
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,583
I can do that.

334
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,083
Good.

335
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,750
Go into the cockpit.

336
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,625
Look for a small com panel
in the instrument array.

337
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,000
See if you can remove it.

338
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,458
Bring it back here.

339
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,667
Don't move.
I'll be back.

340
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:49,750
I am going to kill him
with my bare hands.

341
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,750
I will take him
by the throat

342
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,625
and rip out
his esophagus...

343
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,375
Worf!

344
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,417
I have failed in my mission,
Commander.

345
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,709
I am clearly a bad diplomat.

346
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:04,875
For the sake of the ship
and the Federation

347
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,417
I request
reassignment.

348
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:08,083
Denied.

349
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,959
But, Commander, these Iyaarans
are arrogant, irritating.

350
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,959
They cannot be reasoned with.

351
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,959
Ambassador Loquel
is quite pleasant.

352
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,583
I will admit, though,
he's a little unusual.

353
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,625
RIKER:
What have you been able
to find out about him so far?

354
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,834
Well, he seems preoccupied
with recreation.

355
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:28,542
I've spent more time
in Ten-Forward
in the last two days

356
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:30,792
than I have in
the past two months.

357
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:34,542
And he's obsessed with food,
especially chocolate.

358
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,709
You must be
in heaven.

359
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:39,208
To be honest,
he's testing even my limits.

360
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,667
You see? You see?

361
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,083
They are insane!

362
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,709
Worf.

363
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:46,083
You've been very patient
with Ambassador Byleth,

364
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,583
and that's good,

365
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,208
but maybe it's time
to let him know

366
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,375
that some behavior
is unacceptable to us.

367
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,667
I think it's all right

368
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,792
to suggest limits
for the Ambassador.

369
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,458
Aw...

370
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,583
Perhaps we should
loosen things up
a little bit--

371
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:03,291
meet in a less
official capacity.

372
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,542
How about a friendly
game of poker?

373
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,667
(<i> door rattling</i> )

374
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,625
What are you doing?

375
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,667
You should be in bed.

376
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:56,667
Anna, why was this door
locked from the outside?

377
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,041
For your protection.

378
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,417
From what?

379
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,458
There are dangerous
animals here.

380
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,792
Come sit down.

381
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:05,291
Look, I have
the com panel.

382
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,500
Good.

383
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,875
It wasn't easy.

384
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,250
I had to force it out
of the equipment bay.

385
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,458
If we can boost
the out...

386
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,750
(<i> groans</i> )

387
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,792
...the output field,
I might be able

388
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:19,208
to send a
distress signal.

389
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,625
Something seems
to be wrong with it.

390
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,208
What's the matter?

391
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,375
Why, this transmitter module
has been totally destroyed.

392
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:35,125
How could that happen?

393
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,542
It looks as though
it's been hit by a phaser blast.

394
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,959
I used a phaser
to cut it free.

395
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:45,166
Maybe I accidentally
damaged it.

396
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:47,583
Well, you can fix it,
can't you?

397
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,458
No.

398
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,250
Oh.

399
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,583
I'm sorry.

400
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,125
I'm sorry.

401
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,583
I'm sorry.

402
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:09,542
Anna...
we will get out of here.

403
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,458
It's not going to be easy

404
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,667
but we must
work together.

405
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:16,750
I can't believe I did that--

406
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,583
that I damaged our only chance.

407
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:23,250
I've waited for so long.

408
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:28,583
At first, I had hope
that I would be rescued.

409
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:32,458
I kept setting up
microfusion flares

410
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:35,208
and looking up at the sky

411
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:40,583
and waiting for someone
to come and take me away.

412
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,291
But it never happened.

413
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:54,542
There's a...
a precipice near here.

414
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:59,667
I used to go there
and I'd stare down at the gorge

415
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,458
and I'd think...

416
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:04,792
"I can just step over the edge

417
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:07,125
and end it all."

418
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,083
And then I realized

419
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,125
that it was the hope
that was driving me crazy.

420
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:18,333
That I had to accept
I would never get out of here.

421
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,250
Anna, no matter
how long it takes

422
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,417
we will get out of here.

423
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,583
I knew
from the moment I saw you

424
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:33,875
that you were here
to save me.

425
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:36,250
I'll do anything
you want.

426
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:41,542
Just...
don't leave me.

427
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:44,792
I don't ever want
to be alone again.

428
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:57,333
I love you.

429
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,500
(<i> thunder cracks</i> )

430
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,792
I found some<i> coltayin</i> roots.

431
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:21,250
They're not much to look at,
but they taste good.

432
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,750
What are you doing?

433
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,500
You're going
to hurt yourself.

434
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,875
No, no, no,
it's all right.

435
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,750
I'm just trying to dislodge
this power cell.

436
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,375
Nearly got it.

437
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,834
There.

438
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
No, no, it's all right.

439
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,375
The energy relays
are corroded

440
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:44,000
but I think it should be able
to hold one more charge.

441
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,834
If I can regenerate this

442
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,959
then I may be able
to reactivate

443
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,333
the shuttlecraft's engines.

444
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:53,375
Well, I'd say
this is cause
for celebration.

445
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:57,375
I may still have some
Terellian spices around here.

446
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,250
And I'll boil up
these roots

447
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,709
and make us
a nice broth.

448
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,125
Ah, that sounds delightful.

449
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:05,000
Mm-hmm.

450
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,792
If we ever do get out of here,

451
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:11,083
will you promise
to show me

452
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:15,208
this starship of yours--
this<i> Enterprise?</i>

453
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,458
Of course.

454
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:21,208
Anna, would you pass me
that tricorder?

455
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:24,834
I'm going to try to repair
these energy relays.

456
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,750
I meant
what I said before.

457
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,458
I do love you.

458
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,000
Anna...

459
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,458
I'm very grateful to you
for saving my life,

460
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,208
and I think that you are

461
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:45,041
a very warm
and compassionate woman,

462
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,166
and I feel a great sympathy

463
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:51,333
for what you've been through
alone here on this planet,

464
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:55,166
but I don't think that you
can really be in love with me.

465
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,750
How can you say that?

466
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,458
Of course I love you.

467
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:02,125
No. I'm the first person
you've seen in seven years.

468
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:05,458
I'm bringing you the hope
of leaving this place.

469
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:08,917
Don't you think that...
you could possibly be

470
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:12,208
just a little confused
right now?

471
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:16,834
So... you're not
attracted to me?

472
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:19,250
I think
it's a little premature.

473
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,291
We hardly know anything
about each other.

474
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,458
I understand...

475
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:33,709
and I'm sorry
if I made you uncomfortable.

476
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:36,917
Ah... no harm done.

477
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,250
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

478
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,083
It's going to take at least
a couple of hours

479
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,417
to charge this cell.

480
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,667
Then, as soon as it's done,

481
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:50,000
we should get it over
to the shuttlecraft immediately.

482
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,291
This cell casing is already
beginning to break down.

483

Anna?

484

We are going
to get out of here.

485
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,208
Bet is ten.

486
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,125
That's to you, Ambassador.

487
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,792
I will see the bet...

488
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:18,417
and, uh, raise ten.

489
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,041
I'm in for 20.

490
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:33,208

Excuse me, Ambassador.

494
00:30:58,166 --> 00:30:59,333
Those are my chips.

495
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,875
You are in error.

496
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,500
Those chips are mine.

497
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,917
I saw you take two chips
from my pile.

498
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:09,417
You would dare
to accuse me of stealing?

499
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:10,917
Yes.

00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:12,333
You are lying

501
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,166
because you are
losing the game.

502
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,583
I am losing

503
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,667
because you have been
cheating all along.

504
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,500
Wait a minute.

505
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,792
Calm down.

506
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:22,500
Even if I were cheating,

507
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,083
how would a plodding
animal like you know it?

508
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:29,834
You are an insulting,
pompous fool.

509

an ambassador

I would disembowel you
right here!

That was a very
effective demonstration.

I would like to document
this experience.

526

This power cell is ready.

527
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:54,417
We should take it
over to the shuttle.

528
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:58,375
No. We can't leave
right now.

529

Why not?

530
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,542

are too strong.

Wait a few hours,
then we can go.

533
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,417
We don't have a few hours.

534
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:09,750
I told you,

it's a difficult journey.

I'm feeling
very much better.

In fact...

using this any longer.

Why are you trying
to keep me here?

551
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:00,041
Please...

552
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,875
I love you.

553
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:05,083
Why are you keeping me
locked in this freighter?

554
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:07,500
You say that there are
wild animals out there

555
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,375
but I haven't heard or seen
a single one of them.

556
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,417
Jean-Luc...

557
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:12,667
What about
the com panel?

558
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:14,208
You said you damaged
it when you were

559
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,709
cutting it out of
the shuttle. Did you?

560
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:17,166
You see, I find it
hard to believe

561
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,000
that you would destroy
the one piece

562
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,583
of equipment that could get you
out of here after seven years.

563
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:25,542
And what was this
really for, hmm?

564
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:27,709
To keep me immobilized?

565
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:31,166
I was afraid...

566
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,959
I didn't want you
to leave me.

567
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:38,291
So it was necessary
to keep me captive?

568
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,792
I was scared.

569
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:42,166
I wanted you to stay...

570
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,917
to love me.

571
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,083
I'm going to go look
for the shuttle myself.

572
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,250
No!

573
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,792
Anna...

574
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:52,041
Don't fight me!

575
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:54,375
Anna, no!

576
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,917
You should love me now.

577
00:34:57,917 --> 00:34:59,625
We're together.

578
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:02,709
We depend
on each other.

579
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:04,917
I know more about you.

580
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:06,333
Love me.

581
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:10,834
Anna, stop!

582
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,834
I've failed.

583
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:19,417
You don't love me.

584
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,166
It's over.

585
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,333
Anna...

586
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,500
Anna?

587
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,792
Anna, where
are you going?

588
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,417
MAN:
Hello?

589
00:35:57,417 --> 00:36:00,041
Is anyone in there?

590
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:03,041
Yes, inside here!

591
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,417
Hello!

592
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:06,291
Inside the freighter!

593
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,166
The door is
on the opposite side!

594
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,417
Over here!

595
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:16,625
The door's over here!

596
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,750
Voval.

597
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,875
I thought you were dead.

598
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,041
Dead?

599
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:38,083
Yes. There's a woman
living here.

600
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,709
She told me that she'd
been to the shuttle.

601
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:41,625
She said that
she saw you dead.

602
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:44,709
Yes, that is
understandable.

603
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:46,500
When my species is injured

604
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,667
our metabolic rate
slows until our body
can heal itself.

605
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,041
This state could easily
be mistaken for death.

606
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,375
I see.

607
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,500
When you did not
return to the shuttle

608
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,083
I intended to track you.

609
00:36:57,083 --> 00:37:01,166
Surface conditions
made it very difficult.

610
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,709
So cold.

611
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:06,625
I saw someone
running away from here.

612
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,667
Was it the woman?
Yes.

613
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,417
Why did she leave
the shelter?

614
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:12,041
She was upset.

615
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,417
Do you think
she may harm herself?

616
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:18,458
There's a dangerous
precipice near here.

617
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:19,917
She was headed
in that direction.

618
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:20,959
It's possible.

619
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:22,417
Then we should go
find her.

620
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:25,625
You stay here, keep warm.

621
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,291
I'll go and look for her.

622
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:30,000
We will go together.

623
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,417
PICARD:
Anna!

624
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,083
Anna!

625
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:51,500
Captain, this ridge
extends for a kilometer

626
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,417
in either direction.

627
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:57,250
We can search it
twice as fast
if we separate.

628
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,542
Anna!

629
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:06,166
Anna!

630
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,041
Anna.

631
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,750
Anna...

632
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,667
Stay away from me.

633
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,125
You don't have to do this.

634
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:29,041
I found Voval,
the shuttle pilot.

635
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,834
He's still alive.

636
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:33,375
He can help us
get away from here.

637
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,458
(<i> sobbing</i> ):
I don't care.

638
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,333
I'll jump,

639
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:44,291
unless you promise
to love me.

640
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,375
No.

641
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:53,250
No, I won't promise.

642
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,291
You have been manipulating me,
haven't you?

643
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:00,667
Jean-Luc,
what are you saying?

644
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:01,917
The necklace...

645
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:04,041
it broke.

646
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,583
I saw it in the cargo freighter
on the floor by the fire.

647
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:07,667
I left it there.

648
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:09,709
Now it's around
your neck.

649
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:11,750
It's whole! How?

650
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,709
Tell me you love me.

651
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:17,375
I must know.

652
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:21,917
Where's Voval?

653
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:24,375
Isn't it convenient
that he arrived

654
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,125
moments after you left?

655
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,542
That he insisted
that I come here

656
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:29,834
to look for you?

657
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,583
That I find you
here on the ledge

658
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:33,959
ready to jump?

659
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:36,875
That's very good timing,
don't you think?

660
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,959
Jean-Luc...

661
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,041
Are you and Voval
working together?

662
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:44,500
He is the only one who could
have brought you the necklace.

663
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:53,375
Tell me about your love,
or I'll jump.

664
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:55,291
Go ahead.

665
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:57,208
Why don't you do it?

666
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,875
It's a...

667
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,750
long way down.

668
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,542
Must be 200 meters.

669
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:05,417
You'd die instantly,
if that's what you want,

670
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:08,250
but I don't think
that it really is.

671
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,792
I have failed.

672
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,417
Failed?!

673
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:24,458
Voval, what is going on?!

674
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:28,125
My name is Ambassador Voval.

675
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,375
Ambassador?!

676
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,959
My mission was
to study human intimacy--

677
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:35,125
specifically the concept
you call "love."

678
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,542
In our study
of your culture

679
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:39,000
we did not understand
certain concepts,

680
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,083
so we sent three representatives
to study them...

681
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,750
to experience them.

682
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,750
But why did you believe
that bringing me<i> here</i>

683
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,291
would give you a better
understanding of love?

684
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:54,959
Several years ago,
we discovered the remains

685
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,166
of the Terellian freighter
on this planet.

686
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:58,834
The ship contained logs

687
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:00,917
written
by a single survivor--

688
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,750
a human woman.

689
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,583
That was our first contact
with the human culture.

690
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:09,792
The woman lived alone here
for seven years

691
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:12,834
until another human
crashed on this planet--

692
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:14,125
a human male.

693
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:17,667
And the man was injured

694
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:20,917
and she nursed him
back to health...

695
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:22,667
and they fell in love.

696
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:25,250
In the logs,
she described many concepts

697
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,417
we found difficult
to understand.

698
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:30,542
Pleasure, antagonism, love.

699
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:33,083
These were alien to us.

700
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:35,583
We wished to experience them
for ourselves.

701
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:38,500
Ambassador Loquel was sent
to experience pleasure.

702
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,291
Byleth was sent
to experience antagonism.

703
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:47,625
And I was sent
to experience love.

704
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,166
Was this wrong?

705
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:54,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

706
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:56,375
Let me just say that...

707
00:41:58,834 --> 00:42:02,208
we would not take
such a direct approach.

708
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,917
Ambassador,
I have to tell you

709
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:08,375
that in my culture

710
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:12,166
what you have done would
be considered a crime.

711
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:14,917
Crime?

712
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:20,709
Well... we'll talk
about it later.

713
00:42:20,709 --> 00:42:24,250
For now, I think we should
get off this planet.

714
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,000
Am I right in assuming that
the damage to the shuttle

715
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,917
is not as bad
as it seems?

716
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:32,750
That is correct.
We can leave at any time.

717
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,250
I think that now
would be quite nice.

718
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,333
You look a little sore.

719
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:45,917
Lieutenant Worf
was kind enough

720
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:48,500
to engage me in 11 hours
of holodeck battle exercises.

721
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
11 hours?

722
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,709
Yes. I learned
a great deal

723
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:52,208
about the concept
of antagonism.

724
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:57,417
It was... excruciating.

725
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:59,875
Counselor, these are
bioenzymatic supplements

726
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,709
my people
consume for food.

727
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:04,000
I'm afraid you'll find
they are not as delicious

728
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,458
as your chocolate.

729
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,875
After the past few days

730
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,709
I could use something
a little bland.

731
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:11,250
Good-bye, Ambassador.

732
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:13,625
Fascinating species.

733
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:14,875
Indeed.

734
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:19,375
Thank you, Captain.

735
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:22,000
This has been
an enlightening experience.

736
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
For me as well,
Ambassador.

737
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,750
I am sorry if our diplomatic
methods offended you.

738
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,542
No, on the contrary,

739
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:33,208
I found your
approach intriguing.

740
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,834
We humans tend to take

741
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:38,208
a rather balanced
approach towards life--

742
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:41,041
never too much,
never too little--

743
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,917
and it's very nice
to find a culture

744
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:46,417
that is willing
to take an experience

745
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:49,291
to its furthest extreme.

746
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:53,291
Good-bye, Captain.

747
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:55,125
Ambassador.
