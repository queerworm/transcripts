You up and running,
Brevelle?

6
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,375
BREVELLE:
Yes, Lieutenant.

7
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,667
Checked buildings
four and five.

8
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:19,917
Just like
all the others--

9
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:22,250
no phaser hits,
no sign of a fight.

10
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,750
Looks like the whole outpost
just vanished.

11
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,375
Lieutenant Leijten,
you'd better come see this.

12
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:29,875
No footprints,
no vehicle tracks.

13
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:33,792
The wind probably
erased them, but look...

14
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,417
LEIJTEN:
<i>Freeze visual.</i>

15
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,333
That's Hickman on the right,
Mendez on the left.

16
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,417
And as already noted,
the recording was made

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,583
by Ensign Brevelle
five years ago.

18
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,166
Commander Leijten, you said that

19
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,083
before Brevelle deserted
Starbase 112 last week

20
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,625
he'd been ill
for several days.

21
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,375
What about Mendez?

22
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:55,041
Mendez was seen on the<i> Aries</i>
an hour before she disappeared.

23
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,417
According to witnesses

24
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,000
she seemed completely normal.

25
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,375
And Hickman?

26
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:02,166
He just passed a routine
physical on Malaya Four

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,667
with flying colors.

28
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,542
No, no, no wait a minute.
I know Paul Hickman.

29
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:06,583
He's a family man.

30
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:07,917
He's got two kids.

31
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,792
He wouldn't steal a shuttle
and desert.

32
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:14,542
But Geordi, he was spotted by a
federation supply ship yesterday

33
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,333
on course
to Tarchannen Three.

34
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,542
The original Tarchannen
disappearances

35
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,917
were never solved, were they?

36
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,250
No. We never learned
what happened or why.

37
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,959
49 people gone.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,792
And five years later
the away team

that was investigating
their disappearances

40
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:31,542
have started
to disappear themselves.

41
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:35,208
Geordi and I
are the only two left.

Well, I decided that
I'd prejudged him unfairly.
Huh, uh-huh.

64
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,041
And then I decided that

65
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,291
I'd been right

report to the Bridge.

86
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,959
We have a fix
on the missing shuttle.

87
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,709
On our way, Commander.

88

95

Put a repeating message

96
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,000

to come about and stand to.

97

On screen.

102
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,792
DATA:
The shuttle's acceleration
is increasing.

103
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,208
Its trajectory is moving

104
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,250
directly into
the planet's atmosphere.

105
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,750
He will reach
an atmospheric interface

106
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:02,041
at an altitude
of 210 kilometers.

107
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,250
If he stays at that speed,
he'll self-destruct.

DATA:
That is correct, Commander.

109
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,208
How soon, Mr. Data?

110
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,291
53 seconds, sir.

112
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,750
He's out of transporter range.

113
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,875

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,000
You are in danger.

120
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,959
You must slow your rate
of approach.

121
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,750
The shuttle is approaching
the outer thermosphere, Captain.

122
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,250
He's panicking.

123
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,834
DATA:
At the current
rate of acceleration,

124
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,208
the shuttle will be
destroyed in 28 seconds.

125
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,625
16 seconds to impact.

126
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:53,125
Lieutenant Hickman,
you must do what I tell you.

127
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,208
Reduce your velocity
and bring your craft

128
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,333
to a positive pitch
of 20 degrees<i> now.</i>

129
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,250

147
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,250

150
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,083

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,458
Mendez and Brevelle

156
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,875
You saw the footprints?

157
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:56,166
Yeah,
but they're not human.

158
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,500
They're here.

159
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:01,875
Just stand still
and listen.

160
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:02,875
You can feel it.

161
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:03,834

What happened?

176
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,125
BEVERLY:
Your blood chemistry is way off.

177
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,000
You had a histamine response.

178
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,500
To what, I don't know.

179
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:04,208
I'm going to run a complete
blood and tissue analysis.

180
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,000

00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,875
Uh-uh, until I have
some answers

182
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,792
I don't want you
to leave the<i> Enterprise.</i>

183
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,166
I have work to do.

184
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,625
Look, Commander,
you may have just had

185
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,166
an anxiety reaction
down there

186
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,250
but I've got
to know for sure.

187
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,542
It might not be such a bad idea
to take it easy for a while.

188
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,875
I'm not going to stay locked up
on this ship while

189
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,625
the investigation is going on.

190
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,667
PICARD:
Your devotion to duty
is admirable, Commander.

191
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,250
But Dr. Crusher is right.

192
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,792
You'll remain on board
the<i> Enterprise</i>

193
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,291
until we know whether or
not this is connected

194
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,041
with the disappearance
of the others.

195
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,834
Captain...
We have completed our
survey of the surface.

196
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,500
Analyzing all that Data

197
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:43,375
will keep us busy
for a while.

198
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,208
Yes, sir, I understand.

199
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,542
Data's got a preliminary report

200
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,875
if you're up to it.

201
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:51,417
Sure, let's get going.

202
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,917
What about La Forge?

203
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,667
I gave him
a complete bioscan.

204
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:05,583
The results say
he's in perfect shape.

205
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,458
That's what all the reports said
about Mendez and Hickman

206
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,250
before they disappeared.

207
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:16,875
Captain Picard's wrong.

208
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,291
The way to handle this

209
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,834
is to get back down there
with a dozen away teams.

210
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,041
Fan out from the shuttle.

211
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,875
We can cover a lot
of ground in a hurry.

212
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:26,291
Use proximity detectors,
infrared sensors...

213
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,792
Susanna...

214
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,041
Oh, Geordi, it's started.

215
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,166
What if what happened
to the others

216
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,166
is happening to me?

217
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,291
You don't know that.

218
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,208
Suz...

219
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,458
I'm here.

220
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,959
And I'm not going to let
anything happen to you, okay?

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,417
Okay, come on.

222
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,250
During microscopic examination
of the torn uniform

223
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,166
I discovered
these alien skin cells.

224
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,417
Source?

225
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,792
Undetermined.

226
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:10,000
Without something else to
cross-reference

227
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,458
it would take us weeks
to try and identify them.

228
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,750
Fortunately,
we have more evidence.

229
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,083
We were able to determine

230
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,917
that these footprints
found near the shuttle

231
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,792
were not made by any known
Tarchannen life-form.

232
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,917
If we're pursuing
the theory

233
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,208
that somehow unknown
aliens were involved

234
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,500
I think I should tell you

235
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,333
that we didn't find
tracks like that

236
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,291
during the original
investigation.

237
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,333
The planet is subject
to frequent sandstorms.

238
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,875
The footprints might
have been obliterated

239
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,500
prior to your
arrival.

240
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:41,500
Dr. Crusher and I will begin
to search the medical database

241
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,083
in an attempt to match these

242
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,959
with some known life-form.

243
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,875
Aliens or no aliens

244
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:54,125
why would our people start
returning after five years

245
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,500
to be abducted?

246
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,417
Some sort of compulsion,

247
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,208
like a post-hypnotic command?

248
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,667
Something that happened

249
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,917
while we
were down there the first time?

250
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:05,750
We can go back
to the mission record

251
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,375
and reconstruct a log
of everyone's movements.

252
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,667
Look for some sort
of commonality--

253
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,667
something we all touched.

254
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:14,333
Maybe a plant

255
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,667
or the sand.

256
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,375
Or even something
we ingested.

257
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:22,291
It could even be
in the air itself.

258
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,667
The parameters
are pretty broad, Data.

259
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:35,458
Any match we make is going
to be inconclusive at best.

260
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,083
I am aware of that, Doctor,

261
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,792
however, I can see

262
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:41,792
no other reasonable course of
investigation available to us.

263
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,375
We may not have much time.

264
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,959
You're worried about Geordi,
aren't you?

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,458
I am an android.

266
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,000
It is not possible
for me...
For you to feel anxiety.

267
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:56,083
Starfleet personnel
have vanished.

268
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,500
Others may be at risk.

269
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:59,333
We must do the best we can
to find out why.

270
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,792
(<i> clears throat</i> )

271
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:06,125
However, I am...

272
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,542
... strongly motivated
to solve this mystery.

273
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,333
MENDEZ:
Ensign Hickman?

274
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,500
(<i> console beeping</i> )

275
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:40,917
(<i> sighing</i> )

276
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,542
Freeze visual.

277
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,875
We're wasting our time.

278
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,542
That's not how you felt before.

279
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,041
It was your idea to look
for some sort of commonality.

280
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,959
Well, I was wrong.

281
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,625
We're not going
to find anything this way.

282
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,083
We should go back to the planet.

283
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,208
It's all down there--

284
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,291
everything
we need to know.

285
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,792
Well that's just
not an option.

286
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,583
At least not until
Captain Picard says it is.

287
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,333
Computer, resume.

288
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,792
I can't look at that anymore.

289
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,041
Hurts my eyes.

290
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,542
I can't think.

291
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,875
My mind feels like
it's wrapped up in a blanket.

292
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:32,041
Take a break, alright?
I'll work on this.

293
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,709
I don't need a break.

294
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,125
I need to get off this ship.

295
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,542
Susanna, why don't we go
and see Dr. Crusher.

296
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,291
Forget crusher
and forget your logs.

297
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,917
Tarchannen's down there,
Geordi.

298
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,583
It's waiting for us.

299
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,792
That's where
we should go.

300
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:55,458
Susanna...

301
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,750
you can't leave.

302
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,750
Susanna!

303
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,333
Susanna!

304
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,625
Geordie.

305
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,750
Her blood pressure
is still falling.

306
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,000
Apply the T-cell stimulator.

307
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,250
We have got to stabilize
her immune system.

308
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,750
She has developed an extreme
sensitivity to light.

309
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:51,834
We're trying to make her
as comfortable as we can.

310
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,542
Oh, God.

311
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,834
Geordi?

312
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,750
Susanna...

313
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,709
Hold on, okay?

314
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,792
Dr. Crusher will help you.

315
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,875
So just hold on.

316
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:34,709
It's inside of me, Geordi.

317
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,667
I can't fight it.

318
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,959
It's winning.

319
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,125
Don't give up.

320
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,458
Do you hear me?

321
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,792
You can't give up, Suz.

322
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,875
BEVERLY: This is one of
Susanna's altered skin cells

323
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,959
and this is one of the alien
cells Data found.

324
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,959
They're almost identical.
How do you explain that?

325
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,333
Jean-Luc, I think the people
from Tarchannen Three

326
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,208
who disappeared
weren't abducted.

327
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,166
I think they were transformed
into another species.

328
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,917
Can you stop it, Doctor?

329
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:20,333
The T-cell stimulator will
slow down the rate of change

330
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,959
but until I find
the cause...

331
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,250
Is the<i> Enterprise</i> at risk?

332
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,750
No. I checked
the cell wall integrity.

333
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,125
Its viability
is extremely low.

334
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,500
I don't think
it's possible

335
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:30,792
for Susanna
to transmit it.

336
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:33,333
Then how
did she get it?

337
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,250
I wish I knew.

338
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,709
The only thing
I do know, Geordi

339
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,792
is that it's very possible
that you will be next.

340
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,542
But...

341
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:58,458
I had two
full bioscans today.

342
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,000
You said I was fine.

343
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,375
I gave Susanna a bioscan too.

344
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,333
I didn't find anything
wrong with her either.

345
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,792
How long?

346
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,500
Brevelle was sick for days
before he left.

347
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:17,166
Mendez was normal
an hour before she disappeared.

348
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,417
You may have weeks
or very few hours.

349
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,083
Then there's not
much time to waste.

350
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,208
I should get back to work.

351
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,792
Geordi...

352
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,834
Until I know
what we're dealing with

353
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,417
I think you should
stay here in sick bay.

354
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,959
Doctor, you said
that it would help

355
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,667
if you knew
the source of this.

356
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:38,750
If I could continue my analysis
of the mission records

357
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,291
I might find an answer.

358
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,959
Mr. La Forge...

359
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,542
What if you begin
to change?

360
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,834
What if you feel compelled

361
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,375
to go down to the planet
like the others?

362
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:51,208
Program the computer
to monitor my movements.

363
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,417
That way, we can be sure
that I don't leave the ship.

364
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,417
What would you do,
Captain?

365
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,875
Would you sit it
out here in sick bay

366
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:04,125
or try to learn what
it is that's got you--

367
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,709
maybe stop it?

368
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,500
Very well, Mr. La Forge.

369
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,208
You proceed with your
investigation

370
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,625
but I want you to report to
Dr. Crusher for a bioscan

371
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,166
at the start
of the day watch.

372
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,250
Aye, sir.

373
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,875
And Geordi,
if you have symptoms

374
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,583
of any kind

375
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,792
I want to know<i> immediately.</i>

376
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,667
Understood.

377
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,792
One to transport.

378
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:39,583
I want to make another sweep
of the perimeter.

379
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,125
La Forge, you start
at building four.

380
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,667
Mendez and Brevelle,
begin at two

381
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,083
I'll take five.

382
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:51,458
All right, computer.

383
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,041
Analyze audio elements

384
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:56,959
from time index 1447

385
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,458
to 1558.

386
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,917
List all anomalies.

387
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:04,834
COMPUTER:
No audio anomalies present.

388
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:08,333
Any subspace projections,

389
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,417
Z-Particle emissions

390
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,750
interferometric frequencies?

391
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,083
No subspace projections present.

392
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,041
No Z-Particle
emissions present.

393
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,250
No interferometric
patterns present.

394
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,750
Damn!

395
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,375
Geordi?

396
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:31,834
May I inquire how your
investigation is proceeding?

397
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,625
It's not.

398
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:35,834
Have you attempted
an audio analysis?

399
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,834
Yes, Data

400
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,959
<i>and</i> a spectrographic analysis

401
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,875
<i>and</i> a screen
for ionizing radiation.

402
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:47,458
I even ran an enhancement
for micro-seismic disturbances.

403
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,375
I've tried it all, okay?

404
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,458
(<i> sighing</i> )

405
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,709
I'm sorry.

406
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,542
There was no need
for an apology.

407
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:07,625
Perhaps if you indulged
in a brief rest period

408
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,125
you would be able
to approach this problem

409
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,875
with a fresh point of view.

410
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,542
Yeah, you're probably
right, Data

411
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,750
but I've got to keep scanning
these records while I can.

412
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,709
May I assist you?

413
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,208
If I knew
what I was looking for...

414
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,417
really, Data

415
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:29,125
I think it's just a matter
of me going over it

416
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,917
maybe finding something
I forgot.

417
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:35,166
I'll let you know if I come
across anything, all right.

418
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:43,166
All right, computer.

419
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,917
One more time.

420
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,792
OGAWA:
Sorry to disturb you, Doctor.

421
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:56,291
That's all right.
What's happened?

422
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,917
I thought
you should see this.

423
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,834
Her skin is simulating
the light.

424
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,500
A radiant reaction.

425
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:09,625
Some sort of mimetic ability?

426
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:10,750
That's not all.

427
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,291
Her body temperature
is dropping.

428
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:17,125
It's as if she's generating
a disruptive field.

429
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,250
I can barely get any readings
off of her now.

430
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:21,083
What's her rate
of transformation?

431
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,208
It's increasing.

432
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,834
That's not possible.

433
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:27,667
It should have been inhibited
by the T-cell stimulator

434
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:29,041
unless...

435
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,375
if there's a foreign body
inside her

436
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:36,083
that's producing these changes--

437
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:39,000
something like a viral creche...

438
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,917
A very small one
if our scans haven't found it.

439
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:44,500
I want a full
genetic analysis.

440
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,875
We're going to examine
any abnormality we find

441
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,083
no matter how insignificant
it seems.

442
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:54,750
One to transport.

443
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,583
Computer, delete the audio.

444
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,667
Wait a minute.

445
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,041
Freeze visual.

446
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,208
Whose shadow is that?

447
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,542
COMPUTER:
Please restate question.

448
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:19,792
Computer, the shadow
currently displayed

449
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:21,625
in Section B-3--

450
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,375
what is its source?

451
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:24,917
Unknown.

452
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,375
Come on, it's got to belong
to somebody.

453
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:31,000
Computer, replay visual

454
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,041
of the last time index.

455
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:36,959
No audio and slow to 50%.

456
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:50,625
Okay, Brevelle's
behind the camera

457
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:53,583
Susanna and I head off
in that direction.

458
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,750
Mendez moves off that way.

459
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,166
Freeze visual.

460
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:04,208
Now magnify four times.

461
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,458
And spectrally enhance
those shadows.

462
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,041
Computer, do you have
sufficient data

463
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,750
to compile
a holographic simulation

464
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,667
of this visual record?

465
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:16,166
A simulation would be limited

466
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:19,208
to areas scanned
by the visual recording device.

467
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,750
Good, fine.
Scan the entire record

468
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,792
and then recreate it
on Holodeck Three.

469
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:31,333
Computer, is the Tarchannen
simulation ready?

470
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,458
Affirmative.

471
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,625
Program complete.

472
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,125
Enter when ready.

473
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:20,166
Computer,

474
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,291
scan Starfleet records

475
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,959
and create a simulation
of Brevelle.

476
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,792
Place him where he was
while recording this.

477
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,083
Okay. Good.

478
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,834
Computer,

479
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:45,458
based on their
speed and direction

480
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,709
can you extrapolate
each officer's movements

481
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,500
as they walked out
of the recording device's

482
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:51,375
field of view?

483
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:54,709
Affirmative, with an increasing
probability of error

484
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,375
reaching 95% after ten seconds.

485
00:28:58,417 --> 00:28:59,375
Understood.

486
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:01,000
Run simulation.

487
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,792
I want to make another sweep
of the perimeter.

488
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:06,458
La Forge, you start
at building four.

489
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,208
Mendez and Brevelle,
you begin at two.

490
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,333
I'll take five.

491
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,542
Computer, freeze.

492
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:19,166
It's all happening too fast.

493
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,667
Computer, reverse simulation.

494
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:25,125
Run it back to time index 1472.

495
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,959

497

Computer, remove La Forge.

498
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,792
And... now remove Leijten.

499
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,333
And now remove Mendez.

500
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:28,125
Computer, using vector analysis

501
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:32,000
identify the source
of this shadow.

502
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,250
There is no object
in the program

503
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,959
which could generate the shadow.

504
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,917
(<i> sighs</i> ) There...

505
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:42,083
there has to be

506
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:45,834
something between...

507
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:49,000
the camera light
and this wall.

508
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,709
Computer,

509
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,083
given the distance

510
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,291
between the light and the wall

511
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,709
can you determine

512
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,709
the most likely shape
and position

513
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,333
of the object
causing this shadow?

514
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:11,583
There is insufficient data

515
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:14,750
to reconstruct
the requested object.

516
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,542
(<i> groaning</i> )
All right.

517
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:25,000
Let's say
that my friend and I here

518
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,375
are about the same size...

519
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:29,291
say...

520
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,625
1.7 meters.

521
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:33,834
Now can you extrapolate
its shape

522
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:37,000
and its position?

523
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,500
Affirmative.

524
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:39,875
Do it.

525
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,834
(<i> pained gasping</i> )

526
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,542
BEVERLY:
There-- in the thymus.

527
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,125
Some sort of parasite.

528
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:45,291
It's using
Susanna's immune system

529
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:48,000
to spread
genetic instructions.

530
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,917
How did it get there?

531
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:52,917
She could have been infected
during the original mission.

532
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,375
It's small enough to have
entered through any

533
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:55,709
of the mucous membranes.

534
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:01,375
But it certainly isn't behaving
like a typical parasite.

535
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,250
It isn't feeding off of her.

536
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:06,583
It's transforming her DNA
to match its own.

537
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:08,875
There's not much
of her original DNA left.

538
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:11,625
And we're going to need
unaltered genes

539
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:14,458
or we're never
going to get her back.

540
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,875
We've got to get that thing
out of her now.

Any luck?

543
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,166
Negative, Commander.
Nothing in our survey

544
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,917
suggests the source
of a parasitic infection.

545
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,166
Crusher to Bridge.

546
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,458
Go ahead, Doctor.

547
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,333
The surgery was successful

548
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,083
but it's going to be
a few more hours

549
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,959
before we know whether
her regenerative systems

550
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,417
are responding.

551
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:50,750
In the mean time,
we'd better get

552
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,959
Commander La Forge
down here.

553
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,125
PICARD:
Very well, Doctor.
Keep us informed.

554
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,000
Crusher to La Forge.

555
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:01,041
Computer,
locate Commander La Forge.

556
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:04,291
Commander La Forge is not
on board the<i> Enterprise.</i>

557
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,542
Bridge, the computer

558
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,333
says Commander La Forge
is no longer on board.

559
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,500
Is that correct?

560
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:11,792
I am showing
no transporter activity.

561
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,542
All shuttles are secure.

562
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,250
Negative, there is no indication
that he's left the ship.

563
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,500
Computer, what was the last
known location

564
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:19,750
of Commander La Forge?

565
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:21,125
Holodeck Three.

566
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:23,834
BEVERLY: Captain,
if Geordi has transformed

567
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,166
he may be virtually a chameleon.

568
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:28,083
The skin develops
mimetic capabilities.

569
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:32,250
He may still be on board,
but undetectable to our sensors.

570
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:43,875
You search the structure.

571
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,208
I will take the perimeter.

572
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:00,875
Commander...

573
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:03,041
Geordi's uniform.

574
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,458
Security,
we have an intruder

575
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,959
in Transporter Room Six...

576
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:25,041
Captain, the security lockout

577
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,458
on Transporter Room Six
has been broken.

578
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,417
Re-engage now.

579
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,750
I cannot, sir.

580
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,750
The transporter cycle
has already begun.

581
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:47,542
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44668.1.</i>

582
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:49,375
<i>Dr. Crusher's research</i>
<i>indicates</i>

583
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:50,792
<i>that we have less than an hour</i>

584
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:53,125
<i>before Commander La Forge's</i>
<i>transformation</i>

585
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:55,000
<i>becomes irreversible.</i>

586
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:58,667
<i>However, all attempts to locate</i>
<i>him on the surface have failed.</i>

587
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,709
I do not read any life signs
on the surface.

588
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,291
Our sensor array
is useless.

589
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,125
We must find some other way
of locating him.

590
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,583
Captain, if we can get
close enough to Geordi,

591
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,375
we can read
his absorption spectrum

592
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:18,041
with an ultraviolet light.

593
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,208
Can you modify an
emergency beacon

594
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,291
to operate on U.V.?

595
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:23,333
Yes, sir.
PICARD:
Make it so.

596
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:24,792
Number One,
as soon as Data is ready

597
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,625
I want you to lead
an away team.

598
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,083
Aye, sir.

599
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:33,333
(<i> crew murmur</i> )

600
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,125
How long, Data?

601
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,792
I must replace
the emitter module

602
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:55,834
and reconnect
the power supply.

603
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,750
It will take approximately
two minutes

604
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:59,417
to complete
the modifications, sir.

605
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,834
Hedrick to Commander Riker.

606
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:01,875
Go ahead.

607
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,041
I've been able to determine

608
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:04,709
La Forge's transport
coordinates.

609
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,417
He beamed down
next to the<i> Aries</i> shuttle.

610
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,792
Acknowledged.

611
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,875
He's on foot.
He couldn't have gotten too far.

612
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:15,291
Let's assume a radius
of ten kilometers.

613
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,083
That still leaves
a search area

614
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,375
of more than 300
square kilometers.

615
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:21,583
We've got to narrow that down.

616
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,875
What's happening
with the enhanced sensor arrays?

617
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:25,583
All scans are still negative.

618
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:29,125
We've got to find a way to
track him.

619
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,000
What about
the high-resolution E.M. scan?

620
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,458
We are adjusting sensors

621
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,875
to read Commander La Forge's
absorption spectrum,

622
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:37,000
but it will take
several hours.

623
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,917
Geordi doesn't have
several hours.

624
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:41,333
I have completed
modifications, Commander.

625
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,959
Excellent.
Dr. Crusher,

626
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,875
meet us in Transporter
Room Six immediately.

627
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,625
He's going to need
a sedative.

628
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,750
Give me ten ccs
of kayolane.

629
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:52,125
Dr. Crusher...

630
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:01,333
Say, you look better
than you did an hour ago.

631
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:02,875
What did you do?

632
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:05,667
We've removed some kind of
parasite from your thymus.

633
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:08,041
No, no, no, it's not
a parasite, doctor.

634
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,291
It was their method
of reproduction

635
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,834
to plant a DNA strand
in a living host

636
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,709
that causes a metamorphosis.

637
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,041
Geordi?

638
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:19,208
He's gone?
Yes.

639
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,625
He's gone back
to the planet?

640
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,250
Try to stay calm.
No but, we have to find him.

641
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,208
An away team is preparing
to search for him.

642
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,375
No, you'll never be able
to find him.

643
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:27,917
I'm the only one who can.

644
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,750
No you must
turn them off.

645
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:47,875
The light frightens them.

646
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,083
What about the ultraviolet?

647
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,875
That's beyond their
visual spectrum.

648
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:52,500
They won't
run away from it.

649
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,875
He could be
several kilometers away by now.

650
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,125
SUSANNA:
No, he's here.
They're all here.

651
00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:20,041
There.

652
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,792
Geordi?

653
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,959
Geordi, stop.

654
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,792
No, wait.

655
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:13,750
Geordi?

656
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:15,917
Geordi, my voice
is familiar.

657
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:17,291
Listen to it.

658
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:20,291
You can feel
that we share this.

659
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,166
You know
I'm not a threat.

660
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,834
The others--

661
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,750
Mendez, Brevelle--

662
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,125
they don't exist
as humans anymore

663
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,166
but a part of you
still does.

664
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:37,625
You're not one
of them yet, Geordi.

665
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:40,166
I can help you
if you'll just trust me.

666
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,667
I know what's going on
inside of you.

667
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,417
The war you're fighting
with yourself.

668
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:50,500
Your humanity slipping away.

669
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:54,375
The instinct to run--

670
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:56,959
it's overpowering,

671
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,500
but they know
how to beat it now, Geordi.

672
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,875
Look at me.

673
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,792
I've come back,
Geordi.

674
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,542
Let me take you back too.

675
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,375
Just take my hand.

676
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,792
Please.

677
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,625
Crusher to<i> Enterprise.</i>

678
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,250
Lock onto
Commander Leijten's signal.

679
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:23,583
Prepare to beam two
directly to Sick Bay.

680
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,792
We're going home,
Geordi.

681
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:41,750
Is there no hope
for Brevelle or Mendez?

682
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,083
None.

683
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,208
Susanna...

684
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,750
I'm right here, Geordi

685
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:55,667
and so are Dr. Crusher
and Captain Picard.

686
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:57,542
Here's your VISOR,
Geordi.

687
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:16,083
Lieutenant Commander La Forge
reporting for duty, Captain.

688
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,500
Welcome back, Mr. La Forge.

689
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:21,458
BEVERLY:
Geordi, this species...

690
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,000
can you communicate
with it?

691
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,250
No.

692
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:27,834
They act on instinct alone.

693
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,834
In another few minutes,
I wouldn't have...

694
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,834
responded to you, Susanna.

695
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:37,959
PICARD:
Then we will leave them be.

696
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,959
I'll order warning beacons
placed in orbit

697
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,667
and on the surface.

698
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:44,500
Hopefully, no one else will have
to go through what you did.

699
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:53,542
You know, down there, I...

700
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:57,417
I didn't know who you were

701
00:43:57,458 --> 00:44:00,208
and yet...

702
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,667
somehow...

703
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:05,792
I believed you.

704
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:07,875
I trusted you.

705
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:09,417
That must have
been because of all

706
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:13,083
the good advice
I used to give you.

707
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,375
Thanks.
