1
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:06,792
(<i> communications beep</i> )

2
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:08,959
WORF:
Captain, communication
from Starfleet.

3
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:11,542
They have recorded
a disturbance in
the Neutral Zone.

4
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:12,583
Of what nature?

5
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:15,250
A battle--

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,208
in quadrant nine,
coordinates 070, mark three.

7
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,083
There's no information
who is involved.

8
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,583
They are asking
if we can investigate.

9
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,542
Answer affirmative.

10
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:24,333
Mr. La Forge,
lay in a course.

11
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,875
Aye, sir.
I have no reports

12
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,250
of any Federation vessels
in that area, sir.

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,458
Ferengi?

14
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,834
It's a little out of
their territory.

15
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:32,333
Should we separate
to saucer?

16
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,041
Let's get a little more
information first.

17
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,792
Course set, Captain.

18
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,000
Speed, warp 7.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,333
Aye, sir, warp 7.

20
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,500
Engage.

21
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,083
We are now approaching
the Neutral Zone.

22
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,041
Sir, sensors indicate several
recent photon explosions

23
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,500
and heavy phaser activity.

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
DATA:
Sir, I have
analyzed the residue

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,250
from the explosions.

26
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,875
This is of no known
Ferengi design.

27
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,750
It is possibly Romulan.

28
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,166
Now, there's a name we
haven't heard for a while.

29
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,291
I could go a lot
longer without hearing it.

30
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,208
If the Romulans have
returned to this sector

31
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,542
we should know about that.

32
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:13,208
Mr. Worf, any
further activity?

33
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,709
Negative, sir.

34
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,208
Slow to half impulse.

35
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,375
Going one-half impulse.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,625
Now entering quadrant
907, mark three.

37
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,875
Shields and deflectors up.

38
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,583
Go to yellow alert.

39
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,458
I have located a vessel, sir.

40
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,500
It is drifting.

41
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,458
Put it on main viewer.

42
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,500
Aye, sir.

43
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,375
PICARD:
Magnify.

44
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,291
The life-support systems
on the ship are failing, sir.

45
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:47,542
Propulsion, navigation and
all communication inoperative.

46
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:48,625
Any trace of
the other vessel?

47
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,000
DATA:
No, sir.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,291
If it is a Romulan vessel,
it could be cloaked.

49
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,166
Tell Starfleet we're
entering the Neutral Zone.

50
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,583
DATA:
Yes, sir.

51
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,792
Mr. La Forge, take us
in a little closer.

52
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:58,875
Aye, sir.

53
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,375
Stay sharp, everyone.

54
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,125
It's Talarian.

55
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:16,875
Life signs?

56
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,542
Nothing yet, sir.

57
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:21,500
I have identified
the vessel, Captain.

58
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,625
It is the<i> Batris--</i>

59
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,375
a general
cargo vessel.

60
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,500
A long way from home.

61
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:27,750
Keep alert.

62
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:34,166
Captain, possible life signs.

63
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,291
What do you
mean, "possible"?

64
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,792
WORF:
The readings emanate from

65
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,834
a location near what is
left of main engineering.

66
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:41,375
There's a great deal of magnetic
and radioactive clutter

67
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,917
making a positive
determination difficult.

68
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,709
I'll prepare
an away team.

69
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,458
Lieutenant Yar,
you stay at your post.

70
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,166
If this is the result
of a Romulan attack

71
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,959
they may still
be in the area.

72
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,000
Aye, sir.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,875
RIKER:
Data, Geordi-- let's go.

74
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,083
Mr. La Forge,
are we close enough

75
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,792
to use the visual
acuity transmitter?

76
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,333
We can certainly
try it, sir.

77
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,500
Please do.

78
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,375
And Number One...

79
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,625
...everything about this
seems wrong.

80
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,583
Agreed.

81
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,625
It smells like a trap.

82
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,667
Let's go.

83
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,208
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

84
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,041
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

85
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

86
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,917
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

87
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,875
<i>... to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

88
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:58,750
<i>... to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

89
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:05,250
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41503.7:</i>

90
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,875
<i>We have entered</i>
<i>the Neutral Zone</i>

91
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,291
<i>where a Talarian freighter</i>

92
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,458
<i>has been severely damaged</i>
<i>in a battle.</i>

93
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,250
<i>I have sent an</i>
<i>away team to investigate.</i>

94
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,417
What exactly does
this device do?

95
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,625
Well, Data and I have
been working on a way

96
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,542
to transmit what
my visor sees.

97
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:21,208
If it works, the Bridge'll
be able to monitor us.

98
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,417
It has restrictions.

99
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,208
The information
from Geordi's visor

100
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,875
is so complex it is
difficult to encode.

101
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,250
Therefore, the signal
breaks down easily.

102
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,834
That means
it doesn't have much range.

103
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:32,500
Exactly. So far
the effective range

104
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,542
is only a few kilometers,
but we're working on it.

105
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,750
La Forge to Bridge.

106
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,000
WORF:
This is the Bridge.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,041
Worf, I've
switched on

108
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,667
the visual
acuity transmitter.

109
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:43,000
We are receiving.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,792
The signal is strong.

111
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:47,291
Okay, Worf, I'm switching
off for transport.

112
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,208
Set phasers on stun.

113
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,375
Let's be ready
for anything.

114
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,250
Energize.

115
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,458
La Forge to Bridge.

116
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,500
PICARD:
This is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

117
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,667
Captain, I'm switching on
the transmitter.

118
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,333
Ready to receive.

119
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,291
Put this on main viewer.

120
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,500
YAR:
Aye, sir.

121
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,208
Extraordinary.

122
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,875
Now I'm beginning
to understand him.

123
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,667
Geordi, what's that?

124
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,041
Over to the left.

125
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,041
What?

126
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,041
Yes, that.

127
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,250
No, no, back.

128
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,709
Yes, that right there.

129
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:07,000
What is that?

130
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,917
That's Commander Riker.

131
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,500
Ah.

132
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,750
To me, it's just
an undefined form

133
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,375
standing in a...
in a visual frenzy.

134
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,834
Can you...

135
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:24,542
can you filter out
the extraneous information?

136
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:27,458
No, I get it all
simultaneously.

137
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,917
But it's just a jumble.

138
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,834
How can you make head
or tail of that?

139
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,917
I select what I want
and then disregard the rest.

140
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,291
But how is that possible?

141
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,208
Well, how, in a noisy room

142
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,000
can you select one
specific voice or sound?

143
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,375
Of course--
something you learn.

144
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,458
Exactly--

145
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,083
something I've learned.

146
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,959
Does that make it more clear?

147
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,041
Look over at Data.

148
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,875
There's an aura around him.

149
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,125
Well, of course,
he's an android.

150
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:07,834
But... you say that as if you
think that's what we all see.

151
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:08,917
Don't you?

152
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,417
Sir, I hate to break
this up, but, um...

153
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,625
Oh, yes, uh...
of course, Number One.

154
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,792
Um... proceed.

155
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,500
Let's go.

156
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,375
(<i> steam hissing</i> )

157
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:42,583
(<i> loud clattering</i> )

158
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,208
(<i> steam hissing</i> )

159
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,750
(<i> metallic whine</i> )

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,625
I am detecting high levels
of deuterium gas.

161
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,792
Probably from the leakage
in the drive system.

162
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,166
Toxic?

163
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,208
Not as yet, sir.

164
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:35,709
The life signs
are emanating

165
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,875
from the far side
of engineering.

166
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,500
What's the safest
way around?

167
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,458
All routes are
equally dangerous, sir.

168
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,875
Well, what's the least
dangerous route, Data?

169
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,417
There is no
significant difference.

170
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:50,458
Steady on.

171
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:10,834
Commander Riker!

172
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,125
Commander!

173
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,792
Yes, Geordi.

174
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,750
There's a fissure
developing in the bulkhead.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,625
The skin of the ship
is losing its integrity.

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,625
Where is it? I can't see it.

177
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,667
Right there.

178
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,458
Geordi, step closer.

179
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:38,792
It looks to me like
a spectrograph

180
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,083
indicating metal fatigue.

181
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,750
Is that how you interpret it?

182
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,750
Very good, Captain.

183
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,875
Exactly right.

184
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,375
How long before
this hull ruptures?

185
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,041
It's impossible
to be exact.

186
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,208
I'd say five minutes--
probably less.

187
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,709
Let's go.

188
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,417
(<i> electronic fritzing</i> )

189
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,583
Geordi,
we've lost transmission!

190
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,083
Signal overload.

191
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,500
I'm surprised
it lasted this long.

192
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,041
(<i> loud rumbling</i> )

193
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,625
We've reached
the core, Captain.

194
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:33,083
The life signs
are very strong now, sir.

195
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,333
They are coming
from over there.

196
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,875
Is there any other way around?

197
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:37,834
Negative.

198
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,333
This is
the only way.

199
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,291
The safest way to proceed
is for me to cross alone.

200
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,458
The heat and toxic gases
have less effect on me.

201
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:46,875
Agreed.

202
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,709
Captain, Data's
gone ahead.

203
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,250
The life signs seem to be coming

204
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,917
from the far side
of engineering.

205
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,125
I found them, sir.

206
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,583
The door to their
compartment is jammed.

207
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,917
The control mechanism
is not operative, sir.

208
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,709
This is Commander Riker
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

209
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:36,875
Do you hear me?

210
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,125
I advise against
the use of phasers, sir.

211
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,500
The gas buildup
is too great.

212
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,000
He's right, sir.

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,417
A phaser discharge
now could blow us
all out of here.

214
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,250
Shall I, sir?

215
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,667
PICARD:
Number One, what's going on?

216
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,375
We're about to
force the door.

217
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,208
(<i> metallic scraping</i> )

218
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,333
PICARD:
What is it?

219
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,667
What do you see?

220
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,625
Klingons.

221
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,709
Klingons?

222
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,125
I am Korris.

223
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,583
We'll handle the
formalities later.

224
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,166
Right now we have to get off
this ship.

225
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,250
Are there any
other survivors?

226
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,667
No.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,083
I believe I have found
a quicker way out of here, sir.

228
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,542
Check him out.

229
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,166
He is alive, sir,
but just barely.

230
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,125
Then pick up the body

231
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,291
and let's get
out of here.

232
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,542
No!

233
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,417
I will carry him.

234
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,667
As you wish.

235
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,792
Come on, let's go!

236
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,917
Tasha, go to
Transporter Room three.

237
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,083
I want you there
when the away team returns.

238
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,125
Aye, sir.

239
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,959
LA FORGE:
Commander, we are out of time!

240
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,375
This ship is blowing!

241
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,625
Transporter Room,
have you got
a lock on us?

242
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,375
Too much interference.

243
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,792
You have to get farther away
from the engineering section.

244
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,500
Sir, the engineering section
is critical.

245
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Destruction of the<i> Batris</i>
is imminent.

246
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,834
They're out of options.
Do it now!

247
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:50,125
(<i> loud rumbling</i> )

248
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:57,875
(<i> explosion</i> )

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,166
(<i> relieved sigh</i> )

250
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,667
Bridge,
this is Commander Riker.

251
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,583
We are taking
the survivors to Sick Bay.

252
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,542
I'll be in Sick Bay.

253
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,291
Captain...

254
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,625
request permission
to join you.

255
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:35,917
Granted.

256
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,208
The debris is still
being analyzed.

257
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,000
Inform me as soon
as it's complete.

258
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,500
WORF:
Aye, sir.

259
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,083
(<i> groaning</i> )

260
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,375
Situation, Doctor?

261
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,625
His injuries are
very critical.

262
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,917
I'm Jean-Luc Picard

263
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,333
Captain of this vessel.

264
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,458
My name is Korris

265
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,750
Captain of the Klingon
Defense Force.

266
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,166
This is
Lieutenant Konmel.

267
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,917
Would you mind telling me
what has happened?

268
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:12,375
We were passengers.

269
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,125
The Talarians were
taking us to outpost

270
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,917
M-Zed-Five.

271
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:18,542
What was the vessel
doing in the Neutral Zone?

272
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,333
We were attacked
without warning

273
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,875
by a Ferengi cruiser.

274
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,041
During the
course of battle

275
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,625
we must have
unknowingly entered

276
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,208
the Neutral Zone.

277
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,792
The weapons were not

278
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,375
Ferengi.

279
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,709
What is your name?

280
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,125
I am Lieutenant Worf.

281
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,875
And<i> you</i> are a member
of this crew?

282
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,041
Yes.

283
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,959
You are correct.

284
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,125
The weapons were Klingon,
but the vessel

285
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,375
was Ferengi.

286
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,500
What precipitated the attack?

287
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:47,667
I don't know.

288
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,166
We were in
our quarters.

289
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:52,125
The captain of the freighter
had no combat experience

290
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,375
so he didn't anticipate
the first attack

291
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,750
which was nearly fatal.

292
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,333
We took control
with his permission.

293
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,625
The Ferengi called
for surrender.

294
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,542
I told the captain
to agree to all their terms.

295
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:07,125
We had only one chance,
but I was confident

296
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,041
that it would
be enough.

297
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,125
As adversaries

298
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,667
the Ferengi are
not very worthy.

299
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,041
Still, your weapons
were limited

300
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,583
and their vessel
superior.

301
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,333
Yes, all we had
was a battery

302
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,959
of ancient
Merculite rockets.

303
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,166
Our only chance was
to trick them into
lowering their shields.

304
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,500
We reduced power
and lured them in.

305
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
They suspected nothing.

306
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,834
Then, when they lowered
their shields

307
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,750
to beam over a boarding party,
we opened fire.

308
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,041
Still, there are some points
that I'm not very clear about.

309
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,583
Captain, we are
hungry and tired.

310
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:42,792
Of course.

311
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,041
If there is
anything else

312
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,875
you wish to know
about this incident

313
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,667
we will be available.

314
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,125
Permission to
show our guests

315
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,709
to their quarters,
Captain.

316
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:51,750
Permission granted.

317
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,750
(<i> raspy breathing</i> )

318
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,041
What do you think, Captain?

319
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,667
There's more to this
than we've been told.

320
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,792
Why was a Talarian ship
so far off course?

321
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:13,000
What was its point
of departure?

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,166
Why would three

323
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,667
Klingon officers
hitch a ride

324
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,125
on a broken-down
freighter?

325
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,750
Contact Starfleet.

326
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,083
Find out what they know
about Korris and company.

327
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,709
That'll take 48 hours
for a message to get

328
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:25,166
to Starfleet
on subspace frequency.

329
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,375
They're going to be
with us for awhile.

330
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,750
Let's find out all
we can about them.

331
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,667
Do you think I should've
assigned a security team

332
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,250
to keep an eye
on our guests?

333
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,709
No, Worf can deal
with anything
that might arise.

334
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,792
How's your
patient, Doctor?

335
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,375
Not good.

336
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,458
I'll keep you posted.

337
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,542
(<i> groaning</i> )

338
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,417
Sit, friend.

339
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:55,375
Let us eat.

340
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,417
<i>O'mat gri</i>
<i>t'm pffiots.</i>

341
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,709
I did not know
there were Klingons

342
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:10,625
serving on
human Starfleet vessels.

343
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,208
As far as I know,
I am the only one.

344
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:17,750
Tell me, what is it
like for the hunter

345
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,291
to lie down
with the prey?

346
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,959
Have they
tamed you

347
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,041
or have you
always been docile?

348
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,000
KONMEL:
Does it make
you gentle?

349
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,667
Has it filled
your heart with peace?

350
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,000
Do glorious battles

351
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,125
no longer inspire
your dreams?

352
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:35,834
Why do you mock me?

353
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,417
Why do you wish to anger me?

354
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:41,375
Only to see if it
is still possible.

355
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:43,625
It is.

356
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,041
Doctor! I think you'd better
come look at this.

357
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,333
(<i> groaning loudly</i> )

358
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,625
The Klingon's
condition is worsening.

359
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,583
He's convulsing.

360
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,917
Get the hypospray.

361
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,208
Damn.

362
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,458
(<i> noisy eating</i> )

363
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,208
(<i> communications beep</i> )

364
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,750
Commander Korris,
this is Captain Picard.

365
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,125
Yes, Captain.

366
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,458
I'm sorry to report
your comrade's injuries

367
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,041
are beyond
our medical abilities.

368
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,250
He's dying.

369
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,625
(<i> ragged breathing</i> )

370
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,667
(<i> exhales loudly</i> )

371
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,291
(<i> low rumbling growl</i> )

372
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:05,917
(<i> primal roaring</i> )

373
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,083
Is there any
special arrangement

374
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,625
you would like
for the body?

375
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,667
It is only
an empty shell now.

376
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,166
Please treat it
as such.

377
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,417
Be careful.
The opponent
that killed Kunivas

378
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:56,834
should have
been an enemy.

379
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,291
Then his death would've been
even more glorious.

380
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,875
If the opponent
was not an enemy

381
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,083
who was it?

382
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,917
Tell me,
what really happened?

383
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,083
I do not wish
to anger you.

384
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,375
We are, after all

385
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,667
brothers lost
among infidels.

386
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,291
Tell me, how is it that
you come to this ship

387
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,166
that uniform?

388
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,417
Through an act of kindness.

389
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:23,750
The Romulans
attacked

390
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,542
the Khitomer outpost.

391
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,041
Everyone was killed.

392
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,250
I was buried under the rubble
and left for dead.

393
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:33,875
A human Starfleet officer
found me.

394
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,333
He took me
to his home on Gault

395
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,583
and told his wife
to raise me as his son.

396
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,959
How old were you?

397
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,583
Before the age of inclusion.

398
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,834
That young?

399
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Gault is a
farming colony.

400
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:56,041
When my foster brother and I
were of age

401
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,625
we entered Starfleet Academy.

402
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,792
He hated it
and returned to Gault.

403
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,291
I stayed.

404
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,291
You have not
spent much time

405
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,125
among your
own kind.

406
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,917
Hardly none.

407
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,709
So when the night
was still and quiet

408
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:12,834
and the sound of the blood
rushing through your veins

409
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,667
filled your ears

410
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,000
the only way
to silence it

411
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,500
was to slip out
into the night

412
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
and like the hunter
that spawned you

413
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,917
join in the struggle
of life and death.

414
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,458
You were unable.

415
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,917
And those around you
did not understand.

416
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,667
You frightened them.

417
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,709
They shunned you,
cursed you

418
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,125
called you
vile names

419
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,375
and you knew not why.

420
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,291
Even now do you know
why you are driven?

421
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:42,208
Why you cannot
relent or repent

422
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,667
or confess
or abstain?

423
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,458
How could you know?

424
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,083
There have been
no other Klingons

425
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,375
to lead you
to that knowledge.

426
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:57,291
Yes... yes, those feelings
are still a part of me.

427
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,250
But I control them.

428
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,458
They do not rule me.

429
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:11,208
Yes, to fit in

430
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,125
the humans demanded
that you change

431
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,166
the one thing that
you cannot change.

432
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,792
But because you
cannot, you do.

433
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,125
That too is the
mark of a warrior.

434
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,750
You said
I mock you.

435
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,667
I do not.

436
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,166
I salute you.

437
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,291
But against whom
do you test yourself?

438
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:37,041
Against what enemy
do you charge into battle?

439
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,542
I have been
in battle.

440
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:40,125
Then you
understand.

441
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,583
Yes, I do.

442
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:44,917
Brother, this peace,
this alliance

443
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,500
is like a living death
to warriors like us.

444
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,166
You are right.

445
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,250
We lied
to your Commander.

446
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,458
We commandeered
that freighter

447
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,166
and left the crew behind

448
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,125
and we were in search
of a place

449
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,375
where we could
live our lives

450
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,291
like true Klingons.

451
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,625
You did not
battle the Ferengi.

452
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,000
It was one of
our own cruisers

453
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
sent to bring
us back.

454
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,917
You destroyed
a Klingon vessel?!

455
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:11,250
I did not want to
battle our brothers

456
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,041
but I had
no choice.

457
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,500
They have been
corrupted

458
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,667
by the illusion
of peace.

459
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:19,166
They traded
our birthright

460
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,291
so they could die
in their sleep.

461
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:24,208
A peace that makes
the Klingon heart

462
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:27,250
that beats within my
chest wither and die.

463
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,166
Is it permitted

464
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,041
for you to show us
around this ship?

465
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:37,875
Yes, of course.

466
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,750
And as I watched Worf

467
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,041
it was like
looking at a man

468
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,291
that I had never known.

469
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,000
Captain, long-range sensors

470
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,583
indicate another vessel
approaching this area.

471
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,458
Can you
identify it?

472
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,542
No, sir, not yet.

473
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:07,041
Keep a close
watch on it.

474
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,083
So close to
the Neutral Zone

475
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,542
it can't
be random.

476
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,291
CREWMAN:
I want you to have a look
at that sensory data.

477
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,375
What magnificent
battles we could have

478
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,625
at the helm
of this ship.

479
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:24,583
Perhaps your dreams of glory
no longer fit the time.

480
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,792
They belong buried

481
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:28,208
with the past.

482
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,625
Standing here
we will never know.

483
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,917
Our answer lies out there.

484
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:34,667
Our instincts
will lead us.

485
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:35,792
Instincts that have
not been dulled

486
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:38,166
by living among
"civilized" men.

487
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:43,583
I believe, sir, that was
the first time outsiders

488
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,542
have witnessed
the Klingon death ritual.

489
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,333
I can understand
them looking

490
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,834
into the dying
man's eyes

491
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,125
but the howling?

492
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,750
It was a warning.

493
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,041
To whom?

494
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,709
They are warning the dead, sir.

495
00:26:56,709 --> 00:27:00,208
Beware: a Klingon warrior
is about to arrive.

496
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,083
LA FORGE:
Captain

497
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,750
that unidentified vessel
is approaching us

498
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,041
at warp five.

499
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:11,250
Intersect: one hour,
16 minutes, 33 seconds.

500
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,458
Can we get a visual?

501
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:13,500
I can try, sir.

502
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,291
Magnify.

503
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:26,917
Hello.

504
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:31,542
Klingons.

505
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,667
Open hailing frequencies,
Lieutenant Yar.

506
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:34,917
Hailing
frequencies open.

507
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,041
Klingon cruiser, this is
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

508
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,000
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

509
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,208
I am Commander K'nera.

510
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,375
What is your purpose
in this area?

511
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,208
We came to investigate
a battle.

512
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:47,041
We rescued three
Klingon survivors.

513
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:50,291
That is all that is left of
the crew of the cruiser<i> T'Acog?</i>

514
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,000
They were not
off the cruiser.

515
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,625
They were from
the freighter<i> Batris.</i>

516
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,542
Their leader
is Captain Korris.

517
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:57,291
You have him on your ship?

518
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:58,750
He is alive?

519
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,792
Yes.

520
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:02,250
He's a criminal, a renegade

521
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,083
who with two others
stole that freighter

522
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,208
and somehow destroyed
the Klingon cruiser

523
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:08,041
sent to bring them back.

524
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:11,041
We expect the criminals
to be delivered into our custody

525
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:13,250
as soon as we are
within transporter range.

526
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,041
Lieutenant Yar...

527
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,291
where are
they now?

528
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:21,959
They're with Worf
on Deck 17.

529
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,625
Deck 17?

530
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:26,500
Yes, sir, near the
auxiliary turbolift
to the Battle Bridge.

531
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,208
Shall I alert
Lieutenant Worf?

532
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,125
No, send
a security team.

533
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,291
You don't think Worf
would allow them

534
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,083
access to the Battle Bridge?

535
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,333
I think, Number One, we
cannot assume anything.

536
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,500
Captain, shall I remain
at my tactical position

537
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,959
or lead the security team?

538
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:43,250
Lead the team,
and, Lieutenant,
you understand

539
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,041
with whom you
are dealing?

540
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:46,083
Aye, sir.

541
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,709
We have heard this ship
can separate in time of battle.

542
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:56,291
Yes, when relieved
of its bulk

543
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,458
the<i> Enterprise</i> becomes
an exceptional weapon.

544
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,083
Worf!

545
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,625
They have come for us.

546
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:06,667
Step aside.

547
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,917
What is the problem?

548
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,750
The Captain wants those
two taken into custody.

549
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,709
KORRIS:
Do not let them
take us, Worf.

550
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:16,834
Help us.

551
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,667
Listen to the voice
of your blood.

552
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:19,834
You are not
of these people.

553
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:27,625
Yes, join us.

554
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,250
Go back!

555
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,917
Please turn around

556
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,000
and go back
to your mother.

557
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,166
Bridge, we have a hostage
situation on Deck 17.

558
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,625
Mommy!

559
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,583
Bridge, this is
Lieutenant Yar--

560
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,125
disregard.

561
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,834
The situation
is under control.

562
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:29,166
By order
of the Captain

563
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,333
you are confined
to security.

564
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,166
(<i> sighing</i> )

565
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,792
I thought for a minute
we had a problem.

566
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:48,083
Oh?

567
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,625
Yes, it looked
like Korris

568
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:52,000
was going to hold that
little girl as a hostage.

569
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,834
That is not our way.

570
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:55,750
Cowards take hostages--

571
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,083
Klingons do not.

572
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:23,500
(<i> force field humming</i> )

573
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:35,750
<i>R'oiaro.</i>

574
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,208
Lieutenant.

575
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:48,917
A Klingon vessel
has arrived.

576
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:50,875
They have requested the return
of the renegades.

577
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,750
They will be tried
and executed, sir.

578
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,709
I know.

579
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:58,041
Lieutenant, understand

580
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,291
I am not unmindful
of the mixed feelings

581
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:01,959
you must have
about this incident.

582
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,250
Thank you, sir.

583
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,834
Are there no
other options, sir?

584
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:10,917
None that I can see.

585
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:22,375
He seems to be handling
this quite well, sir.

586
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,417
So far.

587
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,625
He must be torn.

588
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:29,041
These are his people.

589
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:31,125
DATA:
The Klingon vessel
is within range, sir.

590
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,375
They are requesting
visual contact.

591
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,834
Open frequencies.

592
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,333
DATA:
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

593
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,750
We are in position now
to receive the criminals.

594
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:45,250
We are prepared
to transfer.

595
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:49,250
WORF:
Captain...
request permission

596
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,208
to address the Captain
on the Klingon vessel.

597
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,291
I know it is against
standard procedure

598
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:56,875
but there is something
I must say.

599
00:32:58,291 --> 00:32:59,333
Permission granted.

600
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:13,542
<i>K'omgi bimogus.</i>

601
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,333
<i>G'armond t'ris.</i>

602
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,041
What is it you want?

603
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,083
To plead.

604
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,792
You waste your time.

605
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,792
Their actions threaten
the alliance.

606
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,250
They disobeyed
and must be punished.

607
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,625
Yes, they must be punished

608
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,166
but not executed with dishonor.

609
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:36,709
Why do you care?

610
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:42,625
What burns in their eyes
fires my soul.

611
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:47,542
I hear their words
and I see it all as it was.

612
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,375
Part of me longs for that time.

613
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:54,208
It's bred in the bone.

614
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,250
We all do.

615
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,083
Then send them to a planet
in the Halee system

616
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,750
where they can meet death
on their feet

617
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,250
with a weapon in their hands,
not tied and helpless.

618
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,417
When one of us dies that way,
it diminishes us all.

619
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,083
Yes.

620
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,750
Brother, I feel as you.

621
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:17,375
I, too,
wish they could fly free

622
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:18,750
but I have no choice.

623
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,125
Sir...

624
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,458
We await the transfer.

625
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,500
Lieutenant Yar,
escort the prisoners

626
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,750
to the Transporter Room.

627
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,000
YAR:
Aye, sir.

628
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,291
This is Ramos.

629
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:32,166
Force field in Security Three
has been broken.

630
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:34,583
(<i> groaning</i> )

631
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,583
(<i> groaning</i> )

632
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,834
(<i> gasping</i> )

633
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,500
(<i> groaning</i> )

634
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,041
(<i> groaning</i> )

635
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:03,166
Lieutenant Yar to Bridge.

636
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:04,333
There's been an escape.

637
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,458
At least one of my security
is dead.

638
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,083
So is Konmel.

639
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,333
Korris is loose and armed.

640
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,750
PICARD:
Keep me informed, Lieutenant.

641
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,792
Aye, sir.

642
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,500
Data, visual on K'nera.

643
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,000
Visual on, sir.

644
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,625
Captain, there will be
a short delay.

645
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,083
Korris has escaped.

646
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:34,250
He is a trained Klingon warrior,
Captain

647
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,000
perhaps more
than you can handle.

648
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,250
It is not a disgrace

649
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,166
to request our assistance.

650
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,417
I think we can handle
the situation.

651
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:53,750
(<i> gasping</i> )

652
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:57,542
CREWMAN:
Stay calm.

653
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:58,625
CREWMAN 2:
Get down.

654
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:12,041
CREWMAN:
He's up there!

655
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,792
Captain, Korris is
in main engineering.

656
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:20,667
PICARD:
Captain Korris

657
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,166
this is a futile attempt.

658
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:23,542
You cannot win.

659
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,125
I will speak
only to my countryman--

660
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,291
only to Worf!

661
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:42,333
Captain, he has a phaser
aimed directly

662
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,250
at the dilithium
crystal chamber.

663
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,375
At that range, one blast...

664
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:47,041
I understand, Lieutenant.

665
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:50,208
Captain, permission
to leave the Bridge.

666
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:55,625
We'll both go.

667
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,417
What's the situation?

668
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,166
He's on the second level,
armed with a phaser.

669
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,834
We do not have
a clear field of fire.

670
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,208
How do you suggest
we proceed?

671
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,333
Wait him out.

672
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:20,959
Captain, let me
talk to him.

673
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,750
I do not think
that's a good idea, Worf.

674
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,208
Right now he's running
on adrenaline.

675
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:26,291
Let it cool. There's
nowhere he can go.

676
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:27,542
He will wait
only as long

677
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:29,542
he believes it is
to his advantage.

678
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,291
The moment it is not

679
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:32,834
he will fire his phaser

680
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,959
into the dilithium
crystal chamber.

681
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,458
That would destroy the
<i>Enterprise</i>

682
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:37,667
and him along with it.

683
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,667
Yes, he knows.

684
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:42,166
Talk to him, Worf.

685
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:54,792
KORRIS:
Brother!

686
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,166
I knew you would come.

687
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,375
Now I...

688
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,750
<i>we</i> have a chance.

689
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:13,000
I could not
do it alone

690
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,041
but I would rather die here

691
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,792
than let the traitors
of Kling

692
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,667
pick the meat from my bones.

693
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,667
With you

694
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:23,250
it will work.

695
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,792
What will work?

696
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,667
I will demand
Captain Picard

697
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:29,125
give us access
to the Battle Bridge.

698
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,208
We will separate from
the rest of the ship.

699
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:35,000
Then, together we will
light up the galaxy.

700
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,291
Imagine the fear that
will roll before us.

701
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,458
Captain Picard
will not comply.

702
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:45,125
He cannot...
dare not refuse us.

703
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,750
In order to save
themselves

704
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,667
they will give us
what we demand.

705
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:50,834
Then, brother,
we are free.

706
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,667
Put down the phaser.

707
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,917
Wait.

708
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:00,291
I do not believe this.

709
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:03,208
Believe it.

710
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:06,291
I have tasted your heart.

711
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:08,000
You have been with them

712
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,709
but you are still<i> of</i> us.

713
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,583
Do not deny
the challenge
of your destiny.

714
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:15,875
Get off your knees and soar.

715
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:19,542
Open your eyes
and let the dream take flight.

716
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,000
My brother, it is you
who does not see.

717
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,709
You look for battles
in the wrong place.

718
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:29,375
The true test
of a warrior

719
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:30,542
is not without.

720
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:31,959
It is within.

721
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:34,750
Here,<i> here</i> is where
we meet the challenge.

722
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,333
It is the weaknesses

723
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,417
in here a warrior must overcome.

724
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,250
No.

725
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,542
You have talked
of glory and of conquest

726
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:49,083
and legends we will write.

727
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,250
Yes--

728
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,125
the birthright of every Klingon.

729
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,458
Yet in all you say

730
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:58,375
where are the words
duty, honor, loyalty?

731
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,417
Without which
a warrior is<i> nothing!</i>

732
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,917
What are you saying?

733
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,709
Living among these
humans has sucked

734
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:10,083
the Klingon heart
out of you.

735
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:12,208
Put down the phaser.

736
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,542
You are a sham.

737
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:17,542
My words were dust
upon the ground.

738
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:20,750
Your blood
has no fire.

739
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,500
You are weak
like them.

740
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,834
I don't care
what you look like--

741
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:26,625
you are no Klingon!

742
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:28,917
Perhaps not.

743
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:30,709
(<i> yelling</i> )

744
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,166
Wait.

745
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,542
(<i> ragged breathing</i> )

746
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,125
(<i> exhaling loudly</i> )

747
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
(<i> low, rumbling growl</i> )

748
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
(<i> primal roar</i> )

749
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:23,959
(<i> roar stops</i> )

750
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:33,000
Mr. La Forge, open
hailing frequencies.

751
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,500
Hailing frequencies
open, sir.

752
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,667
Captain K'nera,
this is Captain Picard.

753
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:38,834
Yes, Captain?

754
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:41,208
Korris and the other
Klingon are dead.

755
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:45,709
May I speak
with Lieutenant Worf?

756
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:53,583
Yes, Commander.

757
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,166
How did they die?

758
00:42:58,625 --> 00:42:59,792
They died well.

759
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:02,333
Do you wish the
bodies returned?

760
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:06,333
They are now only empty shells.

761
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,041
Dispose of them as you see fit.

762
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:14,417
Worf, when your tour of duty
on the<i> Enterprise</i> is complete

763
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:16,625
consider serving with us.

764
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:19,750
Your training and experience
would benefit us

765
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,375
and, perhaps, there are
some things we could teach you.

766
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,959
I am honored.

767
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:28,041
Thank you.

768
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,208
I was just being polite, sir.

769
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,583
Ah...

770
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:51,834
Commendable, Lieutenant.

771
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:58,208
Mr. La Forge

772
00:43:58,208 --> 00:43:59,792
set course
for Starbase 84.

773
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:01,000
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir.

774
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,625
Really...

775
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:06,709
I have no desire
to leave the<i> Enterprise.</i>

776
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:08,000
Good.

777
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,250
LA FORGE:
Coordinates set
in, Captain.

778
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,083
Speed, warp five.

779
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,291
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir,
warp five.

780
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:19,041
PICARD:
Uh, Mr. Worf...

781
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,041
... the Bridge wouldn't
be the same without you.

782
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,166
Engage.
