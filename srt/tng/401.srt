00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:05,125
<i>Last time on</i> Star Trek:
The Next Generation...

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:07,583
Mr. Worf,
dispatch a subspace message

3
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:10,041
to Admiral Hanson.

4
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:12,667
We have engaged the Borg.

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,291
Data, fluctuate phaser
resonance frequencies.

6
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,667
Random settings,
keep them changing.

7
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,208
Don't give them
time to adapt.

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,458
We're coming with
every available starship

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,959
to assist, Captain

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,333
but the closest help
is six days away.

11
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,583
All you know how to do
is play it safe.

12
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,125
If you can't make
the big decisions, Commander

13
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,083
I suggest you make room
for someone who can.

14
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:44,959
(<i> grunts</i> )

15
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,291
If we can generate
a concentrated burst of power

16
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,750
at that same
frequency
distribution...

17
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,125
How do we do that?

18
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,625
The main deflector dish.

19
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,542
Shelby to<i> Enterprise.</i>

20
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,917
We've found
the Captain's uniform

21
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,500
and his communicator.

22
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:21,458
Jean-Luc.

23
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,000
We were unable to
retrieve him, sir.

24
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,792
The Captain has been
altered by the Borg.

25
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,834
CRUSHER:
Will, he's alive.

26
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,166
If we could get him back
to the ship, I might be
able to restore...

27
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,750
This is our only chance
to destroy them.

28
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,750
If they get back into warp,
our weapon is useless.

29
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:39,458
I am Locutus of Borg.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,375
From this time forward,
you will service<i> us.</i>

31
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:55,625
Mr. Worf... fire.

32
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,583
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

33
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:05,291
LA FORGE:
Deflector power
approaching maximum limits.

34
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,792
Energy discharge in six seconds.

35
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,750
WORF:
Firing, sir.

36
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,917
The Borg ship is undamaged.

37
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,834
Impossible.

38
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,750
COMPUTER:
Warning. Warp reactor core
primary coolant failure.

39
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:31,125
I can't maintain it much longer,
Commander.

40
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:36,125
COMPUTER:
Warning. Exceeding
reaction chamber thermal limit.

41
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,875
Cease fire.

42
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:43,041
Shutting down warp engines.

43
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,000
They couldn't have
adapted that quickly.

44
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:54,125
The knowledge and experience
of the human, Picard

45
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,166
is part of us now.

46
00:02:56,208 --> 00:03:01,583
It has prepared us for all
possible courses of action.

47
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,917
Your resistance is hopeless...

48
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,959
Number One.

49
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,709
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

50
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,875
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

51
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:49,750
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

52
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:53,709
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

53
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,083
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

54
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:02,875
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

55
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,959
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44001.4.</i>

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,291
<i>The Borg ship has resumed</i>
<i>its course toward Earth.</i>

57
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,792
<i>We are unable to pursue pending</i>
repairs to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

58
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,917
As we anticipated,
the blast burned out

59
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,542
our main navigational deflector.

60
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,083
We also have damage
to our shields

61
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,667
and our reactor core.

62
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,709
We should be back up
in eight to 12 hours, Admiral.

63
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,208
Well, we'll miss you
at the party.

64
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,667
The<i> Enterprise</i> will be there.

65
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,542
Maybe a little late,
but we'll be there, sir.

66
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,000
Your engagements have
given us valuable time.

67
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:36,625
We've mobilized a fleet
of 40 starships at Wolf 359.

68
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,291
And that's just for starters.

69
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,166
The Klingons are sending
warships.

70
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,083
Hell, we've even thought
of opening communications
with the Romulans.

71
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,834
You realize, Admiral, that with
the assistance of Captain Picard

72
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,709
the Borg will be ready
for your defenses.

73
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,750
Lieutenant, a few years ago,
I watched a freshman cadet

74
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:55,959
pass four upperclassmen
on the last hill

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,959
of a 40-kilometer run
at Danula II.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,291
The damnedest thing I ever saw.

77
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,083
The only freshman to ever win

78
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,250
the Academy marathon.

79
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,917
I made it my business
to get to know that young fellow

80
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,417
and I got to know him
very, very well.

81
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,709
And I'll tell you something--

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,875
I never met anyone
with more drive, determination

83
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,959
or more courage
than Jean-Luc Picard

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,709
and there is no way in hell
that he would assist the Borg.

85
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,583
I want that clear.

86
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,000
Of course, Admiral.

87
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:32,166
He is... a casualty of war.

88
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,834
CRUSHER:
Then we have

89
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,333
abandoned
all hope of recovering him.

90
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,041
In less than 24 hours

91
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,125
this armada's going to hit
that Borg vessel

92
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:45,542
with everything we can muster.

93
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,917
Either they survive or we do.

94
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,875
And as for Picard...

95
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:54,041
a great man has been lost.

96
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:58,000
Your Captain.
My friend.

97
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,917
Commander Riker,
I hereby promote you

98
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,166
to the field commission
of Captain.

99
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,583
The<i> Enterprise</i> is your ship now.

100
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,375
Congratulations.

101
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,458
I wish the circumstances
were different.

102
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,417
Likewise.

103
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,625
Good luck, Admiral.

104
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:19,166
Mm. To us all.

105
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,667
(<i> whirring and clicking</i> )

106
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,667
And Mr. Crusher suggests
we might design a chip

107
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,250
that would automatically
re-tune the phasers

108
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,166
to a random setting
after each discharge.

109
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,250
Engineering.

110
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,917
That would be
a great advantage.

111
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,375
We should also see
if there's some way

112
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,333
that we can neutralize
their force fields.

113
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,291
We've got to let
them know that we can
adapt, too, Mr. Worf.

114
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,917
We're no longer just
fighting the Borg.

115
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,667
We're fighting
the life experience

116
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:34,166
they've stolen
from Captain Picard.

117
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,834
Now, how the hell do
we defeat an enemy

118
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,959
that knows us better
than we know ourselves?

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,750
The Borg have neither
honor nor courage.

120
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:43,041
That is our greatest
advantage.

121
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,583
I hope it's enough.

122
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,041
Accelerator coils
are responding normally.

123
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,125
Excellent.

124
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,834
Forward shields at 58%.

125
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,333
Aft shields...
Sensors must be down.

126
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,333
Checking. Sensors are fine.

127
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,458
No, aft shields
have completely failed.

128
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,250
Damn it! Auxiliary
generators are out again.

129
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,959
Just the man I need.

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,125
We're having some problems
with the aft shields.

131
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,667
The generator's
going on and off-line.

132
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,375
I could really use
your help, Worf.

133
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,333
How soon do we
get underway, Geordi?

134
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,417
Still a couple of hours.

135
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,834
Commander Shelby
can fill you in.

136
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,709
The main navigational deflector
is functional again.

137
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,875
Sherbourne and Barclay
are running through

138
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,542
the final testing
sequence now.

139
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,125
The warp reactor core?

140
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,333
Reconstruction
is proceeding normally.

141
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,792
It's slow work.

142
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:34,583
If we can nail down this
shield generator problem

143
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,458
I agree with La Forge.
We should be back

144
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,125
at operating capacity
in two to three hours.

145
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,583
Good.

146
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,083
Anything else, sir?

147
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,500
Yes. You did a good job
on the Borg ship.

148
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:49,709
I didn't get Picard.

149
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,875
You stopped them.

150
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:53,792
You gave us our shot.

151
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,041
Sir, I...

152
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,667
Commander, we don't have
to like each other

153
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:57,667
to work well together.

154
00:09:57,709 --> 00:09:59,041
As a matter of fact

155
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,250
I'd like you to continue
to keep me on my toes.

156
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,291
Some might define
that as the role

157
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,667
of a First Officer.

158
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:08,375
Damn, you<i> are</i> ambitious,
aren't you, Shelby?

159
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:11,458
Captain Riker, based
on our past relationship

160
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,375
there's no reason
for me to<i> expect</i>

161
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:14,583
to become your First Officer

162
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,083
except that you need me.

163
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,333
I know how
to get things done

164
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,917
and I have the expertise
in the Borg.

165
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,166
And you have a lot
to learn, Commander.

166
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,041
Yes, sir.

167
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,500
Almost as much as I had to
learn when I came onboard

168
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,375
as Captain Picard's
First Officer.

169
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,750
A fact he reminded me of
when I commented

170
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,542
on what a pain in
the neck you are.

171
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,625
Yes, sir.

172
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,291
Data to Riker.
Message from Starfleet, Captain.

173
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,375
Go ahead, Data.

174
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:40,917
Starfleet reports
it has engaged the Borg

175
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,125
at Wolf 359, sir.

176
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:53,750
Admiral Hanson
on subspace, Captain.

177
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:56,542
On screen.

178
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,625
Admiral?

179
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,291
The fight does not
go well,<i> Enterprise.</i>

180
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,291
We're attempting
to withdraw and regroup.

181
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,792
Rendezvous with fleet...

182
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,041
(<i> fluctuating beeps</i> )

183
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:23,500
RIKER:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44002.3.</i>

184
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,500
<i>Repairs are complete</i>
<i>and the</i> Enterprise

185
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:28,875
<i>is warping to rendezvous</i>
<i>with Starfleet at Wolf 359.</i>

186
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,291
<i>Communications from the site</i>
<i>of battle have been cut off</i>

187
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,041
<i>possibly due</i>
<i>to Borg interference.</i>

188
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,250
Lieutenant Worf,
everyone in this room

189
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,208
shares my respect
for your service to this ship

190
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,750
but, right now, I need
your experience at tactical.

191
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:47,250
Commander Data, I realize
your very nature omits ambition.

192
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,959
Nevertheless,
I want you to know

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,875
I seriously considered you
as First Officer.

194
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,709
Thank you, sir.

195
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,458
But this is not
the time for change.

196
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,750
I need all of you
where you are

197
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:01,166
where Captain Picard
always relied on you.

198
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:05,583
I have been... reluctantly...
forced to conclude

199
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,041
that Commander Shelby,
our expert on the Borg

200
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,000
is an ideal choice at this time

201
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,959
for First Officer.

202
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:18,417
Based on our latest
communication, we can assume

203
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,917
that the Borg survived
the fleet's attack.

204
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,834
Your thoughts
on our next encounter.

205
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,959
What about the heavy graviton
beam we were talking about?

206
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,792
I've gone over it four times.

207
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,041
The local field distortion
just wouldn't be strong enough

208
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,250
to incapacitate them.

209
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,917
Dr. Crusher and I
have been working on

210
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,583
an interesting premise.

211
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,000
With our recent experience
in nanotechnology

212
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,500
we might be able to introduce

213
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:41,000
a destructive breed of nanites
into the Borg.

214
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,083
Nanites?

215
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,291
Robots

216
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,458
small enough to enter
living cells.

217
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,834
How long would it take
to execute that?

218
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,500
That's the problem--
two to three weeks.

219
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,333
In two or three weeks,
nanites may be

220
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,333
all that's left
of the Federation.

221
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,583
We have the new phaser adapters.

222
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,709
LA FORGE:
Maybe in concert

223
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,000
with the photon torpedoes,

224
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,417
we can slow them down.

225
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,166
I'm sure Captain Picard

226
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,208
would have something
meaningful and inspirational

227
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,166
to say right now.

228
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,083
To tell you the truth,
I wish he was here

229
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,542
'cause I'd like to hear it, too.

230
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,166
I know how difficult
this transition

231
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,417
has been
for all of you.

232
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,458
I can take over for him

233
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,333
but I could never replace
Captain Picard

234
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,875
nor would I ever try.

235
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:23,542
Whatever the outcome

236
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,750
I'm sure our efforts

237
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:27,041
in the coming battle

238
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:31,166
will justify his faith
in all of us.

239
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,041
Dismissed.

240
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,583
What would you do?

241
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

242
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:52,041
Come.

243
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,542
May I speak
to you, Captain?

244
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,750
Actually, Guinan, I...

245
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:01,709
You know, Picard
and I used to talk

246
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,709
every now and then

247
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,166
when one of us
needed to.

248
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,875
I guess I'm just used
to having the Captain's ear.

249
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,375
What's on your mind?

250
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:19,959
I've heard a lot of people
talking down in Ten-Forward.

251
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,875
They expect to be dead
in the next day or so.

252
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:26,458
They trust you.
They like you.

253
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,875
But they don't believe
anyone can save them.

254
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,375
I'm not sure anyone can.

255
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:37,291
When a man is convinced
he's going to die tomorrow

256
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,291
he'll probably find a way
to make it happen.

257
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:44,000
The only one who can
turn this around is you.

258
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,166
I'll do the best I can.

259
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,542
You're going to have to do
something you don't want to do.

260
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,458
You have to let go of Picard.

261
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,750
Maybe you haven't heard.

262
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,166
I tried to kill him yesterday.

263
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,166
You tried to kill whatever
that is on the Borg ship--

264
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,083
not Picard.

265
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,333
(<i> sighs</i> )

266
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,959
Picard is still
here with us.

267
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,875
In this room.

268
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:14,542
If he had died,
it would be easier.

269
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,083
But he didn't.

270
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:20,667
They took him from us
a piece at a time.

271
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:23,750
Did he ever tell you
why we're so close?

272
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,834
No.

273
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,166
Oh.

274
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:32,542
Then let me just say
that our relationship

275
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:36,917
is beyond friendship,
beyond family.

276
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,542
And I<i> will</i> let him go.

277
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,542
And you must do the same.

278
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,250
There can only be
one Captain.

279
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,417
It's not that simple.

280
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,583
This was his crew.

281
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,500
He wrote the book on this ship.

282
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,959
If the Borg know
everything he knows

283
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,959
it's time to throw
that book away.

284
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,583
You must let him go, Riker.

285
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,417
It's the only way
to beat him.

286
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:04,125
The only way to save him.

287
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:08,083
And<i> that</i> is now your chair...

288
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,583
Captain.

289
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,750
WESLEY:
We are now approaching
the Wolf system, Captain.

290
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:48,041
On my way.

291
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,166
Slow to impulse.

292
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,750
Take us to the battle
coordinates, Mr. Crusher.

293
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:59,375
Yellow Alert.

294
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:02,333
WORF:
Sensors are picking up
several vessels, Captain.

295
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,125
The fleet?

296
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,458
No active
subspace fields.

297
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,208
Negligible
power readings.

298
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,542
Life signs?

299
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,625
Negative, sir.

300
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,083
Visual
contact.

301
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,667
On screen.

302
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:36,375
SHELBY:
The<i> Tolstoy.</i>

303
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,458
The<i> Kyushu.</i>

304
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,583
The<i> Melbourne.</i>

305
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,625
Sir, sensors are picking up
unusually strong eddy currents

306
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,125
bearing 200 mark 211.

307
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,667
Data, analysis?

308
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:19,000
It could indicate the course
of the Borg ship, sir.

309
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,792
Ensign Crusher, set
in a course that
follows those currents.

310
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,542
Commander Shelby,
prepare to initiate

311
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,000
your plan to separate
the saucer section

312
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,417
when we find the Borg.

313
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,417
Sir, I must remind you
that Captain Picard

314
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,542
was briefed on that plan.

315
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,000
The Borg will be
prepared for it.

316
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,500
I'm aware of that,
Commander.

317
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:35,458
In fact, I'm
counting on it.

318
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,041
Crusher, Cartaino, Gleason,
report to the Battle Bridge.

319
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,041
Mr. Data,
Mr. Worf

320
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,792
I have a special mission
for you.

321
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,333
RIKER:
Locutus of Borg

322
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:10,458
this is Captain William T. Riker
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

323
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,291
You may speak.

324
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,709
We wish to end
the hostilities.

325
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,709
Then you must
unconditionally surrender.

326
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,500
We are prepared to meet
to discuss your terms.

327
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:26,500
It is unlikely you are prepared
to discuss terms.

328
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:32,500
It is more likely that this is
an attempt at deception.

329
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:34,208
Come now, Locutus.

330
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,875
If Picard's knowledge
and experience

331
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:38,750
is part of you

332
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:42,208
then you know that
I've never lied to him.

333
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,417
You should also
implicitly trust me.

334
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,583
Is that not so?

335
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,333
Picard implicitly trusted you.

336
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,166
Then trust me now.

337
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,166
Meet to discuss your terms.

338
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,583
Discussion is irrelevant.

339
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,083
There are no terms.

340
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:04,583
You will disarm all your weapons
and escort us to Sector 001

341
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:09,166
where we will begin assimilating
your culture and techno...

342
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,500
Mr. Gleason, can you
pinpoint the source

343
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:12,834
of the Borg transmission?

344
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,875
I can put you within
30 meters of it, sir.

345
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:17,375
O'Brien, report.

346
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,458
The Borg have adapted
their electromagnetic field

347
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,291
to prevent main
transporter
function, sir.

348
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,875
RIKER:
As expected.

349
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:26,375
Mr. Data, Mr. Worf,
proceed as we discussed.

350
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:28,834
Aye, Captain.

351
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,375
CREWMAN:
Channel open, sir.

352
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,208
We would like time
to prepare our people

353
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,208
for assimilation.

354
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,583
Preparation is irrelevant.

355
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:40,375
Your people will be assimilated
as easily as Picard has been.

356
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,625
Your attempt at a delay

357
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,583
will not be successful,
Number One.

358
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,166
We will proceed to Earth

359
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:53,083
and if you attempt to intervene,
we will destroy you.

360
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,125
Then take your best shot,
Locutus

361
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,458
'cause we are
about to intervene.

362
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,667
CREWMAN:
Channel closed.

363
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:01,500
Reset subspace
communications.

364
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:02,875
Scrambler code, Riker One.

365
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:05,583
Scrambler code
Riker One,
acknowledged.

366
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,166
Shelby, report.

367
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,333
Ready for separation.

368
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,166
Make it so.

369
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,625
Auto-sep sequence initiated.

370
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,792
Docking latches clear.

371
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,959
Separation complete.

372
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,333
Saucer velocity, 100 meters
per second and increasing, sir.

373
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,125
Open fire. All weapons.

374
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,834
Fire.

375
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,250
Borg tractor beam
attempting to lock on, sir.

376
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,375
Evasive maneuvers,
pattern Riker Alpha.

377
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,875
Riker Alpha, confirmed.

378
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,000
They're ignoring
the saucer section completely.

379
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:59,667
Just as you should, Captain.

380
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,667
Ensign, evasive pattern
Riker Beta.

381
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:04,542
Riker Beta, confirmed.

382
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,500
Proceed to second phase,
Commander Shelby.

383
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:07,792
Acknowledged.

384
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,583
Fire antimatter spread.

385
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,083
Shuttle launch sequence
confirmed.

386
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:27,291
Departing<i> Enterprise</i>
in exactly three seconds.

387
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:39,083
(<i> explosions</i> )

388
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:53,792
The Borg tractor beam has moved
toward the antimatter spread.

389
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:55,792
They might be picking up
the engine ionization

390
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,000
from the shuttle.

391
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,375
Data, cut your engines.

392
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:00,208
Take her in unpowered.

393
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,041
Shuttle has penetrated

394
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,917
the Borg
electromagnetic field.

395
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,500
RIKER:
Understood.

396
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:13,583
The shuttle
escape transporter

397
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,458
should provide
enough power

398
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,166
to beam us onto the Borg ship
from here, sir.

399
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,583
Proceed.

400
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,166
WORF:
Data!

401
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,333
(<i> grunting with effort</i> )

402
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,542
Mission accomplished.

403
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:43,500
We have him.

404
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:46,375
Firing shuttle
thrusters.

405
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,375
WESLEY:
They're clear
of the Borg field, sir.

406
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,667
Beam them out of there,
Mr. O'Brien.

407
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:57,417
Locked in.

408
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:09,375
Transport
successful, sir.

409
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,583
Captain, we've sustained damage
to the impulse drive.

410
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,291
The saucer section is disabled.

411
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,542
Reading subspace
field fluctuations
from the Borg ship.

412
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,750
Looks like they're getting
ready to increase power.

413
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,959
Stand by, Mr. La Forge.

414
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,166
Aye, sir.

415
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,875
The saucer section's
a sitting duck.

416
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,792
Prepare to draw their fire.

417
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:49,417
Captain, the Borg ship
is moving away.

418
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,834
It's resuming its course
towards Earth, sir.

419
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,250
Rendezvous
with the saucer section.

420
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,667
Lay in a course of pursuit.

421
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:04,458
There is extensive
infiltration

422
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,834
of the microcircuit fibers
into the surrounding tissue.

423
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,500
His DNA is being rewritten.

424
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:09,583
Can you revive him?

425
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:11,583
I'd like more
time to study

426
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,542
the structural changes
in the motor pathways.

427
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:15,417
RIKER:
We don't have
more time, Doctor.

428
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,083
Once he was wired into the Borg

429
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,083
they knew everything
that he knew.

430
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,208
I just hope it goes both ways.

431
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,417
If we're lucky, he had access

432
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,542
to everything we need
to know about<i> them.</i>

433
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,083
Especially their
vulnerabilities.

434
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:39,500
Jean-Luc, it's Beverly.

435
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:40,792
Can you hear me?

436
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:50,625
Beverly... Crusher... Doctor.

437
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,959
Yes.

438
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,500
Don't try to move.

439
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:59,709
I am on board the<i> Enterprise.</i>

440
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,834
That's right.

441
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,208
A futile maneuver.

442
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,208
Incorrect strategy, Number One

443
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,041
to risk your
crew and ship

444
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,959
to retrieve
only one man.

445
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,959
Picard would never
have approved.

446
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,792
You underestimate
us, if you believe

447
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:29,125
this abduction
is any concern.

448
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,917
There is no need
for apprehension.

449
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:38,709
I intend no harm.

450
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,583
No harm.

451
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,375
I will continue

452
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:46,750
aboard this ship,
to speak for the Borg

453
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:50,709
while they continue,
without further diversion

454
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,291
to Sector 001

455
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:57,291
where they will force
your unconditional surrender.

456
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,000
Using multimodal
reflection sorting

457
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,375
I have been able to detect

458
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:10,500
a complex series
of subspace signals

459
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:12,667
between Locutus
and the Borg ship.

460
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:15,041
That's how they're
controlling him?

461
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,375
It is not just a matter
of control, Doctor.

462
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:20,458
The signals are interactive
across a subspace domain

463
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,458
similar to that
of a transporter beam.

464
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,834
I would hypothesize
that these frequencies

465
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,917
form the basis of the Borg's
collective consciousness.

466
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,458
Can't we block them?

467
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,041
Possibly, but as you may recall,
on several occasions

468
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,709
we have witnessed
the Borg removing key circuits

469
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,291
from injured comrades.

470
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,375
No doubt separating them
from the group consciousness.

471
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,875
The injured Borg
immediately
self-destructed.

472
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:42,834
That is correct, sir.

473
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:45,458
Cutting the link
to Locutus might be
fatal to the Captain.

474
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,959
We have to find a way
to reach him.

475
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,417
We must know what he knows.

476
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,250
Without
these interactive signals

477
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:55,375
it would only be a matter
of microsurgery--

478
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:56,625
I could do it.

479
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,625
But as long
as these Borg implants

480
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,583
are functioning,
there's no way

481
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:03,792
I can separate the man
from the machine.

482
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:06,208
Then perhaps there is a way

483
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,625
I can access the machine,
Doctor.

484
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:24,333
Worf. Klingon species.
A warrior race.

485
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,875
You, too,
will be assimilated.

486
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:29,875
The Klingon Empire
will never yield.

487
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:31,750
Why do you resist?

488
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,583
We only wish to raise
quality of life

489
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,125
for all species.

490
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:39,208
I like my species
the way it is.

491
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,291
A narrow vision.

492
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:45,041
You will become one
with the Borg.

493
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:49,083
You will all become one
with the Borg.

494
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,709
The android...

495
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,625
Data...
primitive artificial organism.

496
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,166
You will be obsolete

497
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:58,792
in the new order.

498
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,875
Take him to your lab, Data.

499
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,000
Shelby to Riker.

500
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,291
Go ahead.

501
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,417
Captain, the Borg
have entered Sector 001.

502
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,625
The Borg have dropped
out of warp, sir.

503
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:28,750
Jupiter Outpost 92
reported visual contact

504
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,542
at 1200 hours,
13 minutes.

505
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:31,834
Planetary defenses?

506
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,542
Responding.
No reports on effectiveness

507
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,667
but I really can't believe
that against the Borg...

508
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,500
Ensign Crusher, at
their current speed

509
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:38,583
when will they
reach Earth?

510
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:40,750
27 minutes.

511
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:42,542
The soonest we
could intercept?

512
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:46,250
(<i> sighs</i> ):
42 minutes, sir.

513
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:48,291
Riker to Data.

514
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:49,875
What's your status?

515
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,709
The initial
cybernetic connection

516
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,959
into Captain Picard's neural net
pathways has been established.

517
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,333
Mr. O'Brien is ready

518
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,834
to process
the Borg signal

519
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,709
through the transport
pattern buffer.

520
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,917
Make it so.

521
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,709
With dispatch, Mr. Data.

522
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,458
Proceeding immediately, sir.

523
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,291
Data out.

524
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,041
The neural link
will be established

525
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,792
in three stages.

526
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:26,583
Doctor, I suggest

527
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,792
you closely observe
Captain Picard's life signs

528
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:30,375
while, at each stage

529
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:33,792
Chief O'Brien monitors
my positronic matrix activity.

530
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:35,041
Counselor

531
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,583
hopefully, you will
be able to determine

532
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:40,583
whether I am reaching
Captain Picard.

533
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:42,500
At what point
should I shut it down
if there's a problem?

534
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,500
I do not know.

535
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,500
I have never done this before.

536
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,834
Initiating first neural link.

537
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:56,875
The Captain's vital signs
are stable.

538
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,917
Positronic activity unchanged.

539
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:06,375
First neural connection
is confirmed.

540
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:07,834
I cannot report

541
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:11,834
any significant access
to the Borg consciousness.

542
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,000
WORF:
It is confirmed.

543
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:36,542
The Borg have broken through
the Mars Defense Perimeter.

544
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:40,166
<i>Enterprise</i> now
approaching Terran
system, sir.

545
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,542
Slow to impulse.

546
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,166
Time to intercept?

547
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:46,166
23 minutes,
14 seconds, sir.

548
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:56,792
Second neural connection
is confirmed.

549
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:59,125
I still
cannot report

550
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,208
any significant access.

551
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,208
Proceeding
with the final link.

552
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,750
CRUSHER:
Significant increase
in premotor area

553
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:13,250
and hypothalamus
activity.

554
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,166
His heartbeat is accelerating
rapidly.

555
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,834
Sir, your submicron
matrix activity

556
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,333
is increasing
exponentially.

557
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:22,375
Neural connections complete.

558
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:27,208
I have access
to the Borg subspace signals.

559
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,041
Processing.

560
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,583
Processing.

561
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:32,625
Data.

562
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,291
Stand by.

563
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,250
Processing.

564
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,959
Processing.

565
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,208
Fascinating.

566
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,208
The Borg group
consciousness

567
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,458
is divided into subcommands

568
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,375
necessary to carry out
all functions.

569
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:59,041
Defense,
communication, navigation--

570
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,083
they are all controlled

571
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:04,333
by a root command
implanted into ea...

572
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,667
(<i> gasps</i> )

573
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,208
CRUSHER:
Data, I'm picking
up increased

574
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,250
neural activity
in Captain Picard

575
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:41,792
localized in the
prefrontal and
parietal lobes.

576
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:42,917
The Borg might be trying

577
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,208
to terminate
their link with him.

578
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,500
Negative.

579
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:54,917
The subspace signal
configuration is unchanged.

580
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,583
What is causing the increased
neural activity is unclear.

581
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,625
No, it's not.

582
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,125
It's him.

583
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,417
It's Picard.

584
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,375
Troi to Bridge.

585
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:14,583
Data has made first contact
with Captain Picard.

586
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,583
Can you communicate
with him, Data?

587
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,875
I have been unable
to create a neural path

588
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,750
around the Borg implants, sir.

589
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:22,250
It is Captain Picard himself

590
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:25,667
who has somehow managed
to initiate contact.

591
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:28,667
WORF:
Sir, the Borg have halted
their approach to Earth.

592
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,458
I think we got
their attention.

593
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,875
Time to intercept?

594
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:33,834
Two minutes,
four seconds, sir.

595
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,959
They're worried.

596
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,375
They're worried because
we have access to Picard.

597
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:39,959
Mr. Data, we have two minutes

598
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,709
to figure out
what we can do with it.

599
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,417
Sir, it is clear the Borg
are either unwilling

600
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:47,625
or unable to terminate
their subspace links.

601
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:50,583
That may be
their Achilles heel, Captain--

602
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,333
their interdependency.

603
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:54,208
What do you mean, Doctor?

604
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,583
He's part of their collective
consciousness now.

605
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:58,750
Cutting him off would be
like asking one of us

606
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:01,208
to disconnect an arm
or a foot-- we can't do it.

607
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,458
They operate as a single mind.

608
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,208
One of them
jumps off a cliff

609
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,083
they all jump off?

610
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,166
Data, is it possible
to plant a command

611
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:12,291
into the Borg collective
consciousness?

612
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,959
It is conceivable, sir

613
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,625
but it would require
altering the pathway

614
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:17,917
from the root command

615
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:19,875
to affect all iterative
branchpoints in...

616
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:22,000
Make every
effort, Mr. Data.

617
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:25,208
Sir, what command
shall I attempt to plant?

618
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,667
Something
straightforward

619
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:29,500
like "disarm your
weapons systems."

620
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:30,792
(<i> console beeping</i> )

621
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:32,166
Visual contact with the Borg.

622
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:33,709
On screen.

623
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,709
RIKER:
Magnify.

624
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,750
Sensors reading increased power
generation from the Borg.

625
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,250
Red Alert.

626
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:42,834
Load all torpedo bays.

627
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:43,834
Ready phasers.

628
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,125
Aye, Captain.

629
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:47,083
Status of Borg weapons.

630
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,834
Their weapon systems
are fully charged.

631
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,208
Data?

632
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,333
Attempting to reroute
subcommand paths, Captain.

633
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:56,750
Defense systems are protected
by access barriers.

634
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:03,875
Borg attempting to lock on
tractor beam.

635
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,333
Rotate shield
frequencies.

636
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:06,709
Data, report.

637
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,166
I am unable to penetrate

638
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,041
defense systems command
structure, Captain.

639
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:12,208
Try the power systems, Data.

640
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,792
See if you can get them
to power down.

641
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:15,000
Acknowledged.

642
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:18,041
Attempting new power
subcommand path.

643
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:21,208
Shields have failed.

644
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,458
They've locked on, sir.

645
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,458
They're pulling us in.

646
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,750
Fire all weapons.

647
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,333
I cannot penetrate Borg power
subcommand structure, sir.

648
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,125
All critical subcommands

649
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,875
are protected, Captain.
Then it's over.

650
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:45,542
Mr. Crusher, ready
a collision course
with the Borg ship.

651
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,792
You heard me--
a collision course!

652
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:51,250
Yes, sir.

653
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:54,208
Mr. La Forge, prepare
to go to warp power.

654
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,583
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir.

655
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:59,166
Sleep.

656
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:03,834
He's regaining
consciousness.

657
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,458
Sleep.

658
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,291
It's Captain
Picard speaking

659
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:09,000
not Locutus.

660
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:12,041
Sleep, Data.

661
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,208
He's exhausted.

662
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,333
Yes, Doctor.

663
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,542
But if I may make
a supposition

664
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,667
I do not believe
his message

665
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:23,125
was intended
to express fatigue

666
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:25,625
but to suggest
a course of action.

667
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,834
Borg cutting beam activated.

668
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,000
Mr. Crusher.

669
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:39,917
Eng...

670
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:42,250
Data to Bridge.
Stand by.

671
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:43,291
Stand by

672
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,709
all stations.

673
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,875
I am attempting to penetrate

674
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:48,834
the Borg regenerative
subcommand path.

675
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:52,917
It is a low-priority system
and may be accessible.

676
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:59,250
COMPUTER:
Warning. Outer hull breach.

677
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:01,291
Sir, shall I execute
evacuation sequence?

678
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:02,750
Negative, Mr. Worf.

679
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:04,375
Mr. Data, your final report.

680
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:05,458
DATA:
Stand by.

681
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,750
I can't, Mr. Data!

682
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:08,291
COMPUTER:
Warning. Inner hull failure

683
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:12,917
imminent on decks 23, 24 and 25.

684
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:15,709
Decompression danger.

685
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,917
Mr. Data,
what the hell happened?

686
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:34,959
I successfully
planted a command

687
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,208
into the Borg
collective consciousness.

688
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,750
It misdirected them

689
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,709
to believe it was time
to regenerate.

690
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,250
In effect,
I put them all to sleep.

691
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:47,959
To sleep?

692
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,709
DATA:
Yes, sir.

693
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,083
Status of Borg power drive?

694
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:57,709
Minimal power.

695
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,166
Electromagnetic field?

696
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,834
Nonexistent.

697
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:07,166
Commander Shelby,
take an away team

698
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:10,458
and confirm that the Borg are...
asleep.

699
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,959
Delighted, sir.

700
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:16,875
Mr. Worf.

701
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:39,333
Shelby to<i> Enterprise.</i>

702
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:40,792
It's true.

703
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,750
They're all
in a regeneration mode.

704
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,375
They're dormant, sir.

705
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:46,875
Any indication to how long
we can keep them like this?

706
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:48,291
Checking.

707
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:53,000
Tricorder readings
are fluctuating
rapidly, Commander.

708
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,000
Shelby to<i> Enterprise.</i>

709
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,375
There are indications here
that their entire power net's

710
00:40:57,417 --> 00:40:59,250
about to feed
back on itself.

711
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,583
I'd say we're looking at
a self-destruct sequence

712
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,166
activated by the
Borg's malfunction.

713
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,959
Do you want us to
attempt to disarm it?

714
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Stand by.

715
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,709
There's no way to know

716
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,875
what the destruction of the Borg
ship will do to him.

717
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:14,375
DATA:
We should also
consider the
advantages

718
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:17,083
of further examination of the
Borg and their vessel, sir.

719
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:20,709
I don't think so.

720
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,333
Data, separate yourself
from Captain Picard.

721
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,875
Away team,
get yourselves home.

722
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:26,291
Mr. Crusher,
upon their return

723
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,875
move us
to a safe position.

724
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,542
Aye, sir.

725
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:55,542
Life signs are stable.

726
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:58,542
The DNA around
the microcircuit fiber implants

727
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,333
is returning to normal.

728
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:04,041
How do you feel?

729
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:09,959
Almost human.

730
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,125
With just...
a bit of a headache.

731
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:15,792
We'll get you to Sick Bay.

732
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,333
We won't have any trouble
getting those implants out now.

733
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:21,291
How much do you remember?

734
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,500
Everything.

735
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:31,542
Including some brilliantly
unorthodox strategy

736
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:36,041
from a former First Officer
of mine.

737
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:48,875
...and Earth Station
McKinley has advised

738
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:51,166
that they're ready to begin
refitting the<i> Enterprise.</i>

739
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,792
And the estimated
time for repairs?

740
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:54,083
Five or six weeks.

741
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:55,125
(<i> door chimes</i> )

742
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,250
Come.
Come.

743
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,291
Request permission
to disembark, sir.

744
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,750
Permission granted.

745
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:09,333
They picked
a fine officer

746
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:10,834
for the task force,
Commander.

747
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,208
We'll have
the fleet back up

748
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,041
in less than a year.

749
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:16,208
I imagine
you'll have your choice

750
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,208
of any Starfleet command, sir.

751
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:23,083
Everyone is so concerned
about my next job.

752
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:26,041
With all due respect,
Commander... sir

753
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,917
my career plans

754
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:30,542
are my own business
and no one else's.

755
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:31,625
But it's nice to know

756
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:33,792
I'll have
a few options.

757
00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:37,375
I hope I have the fortune
of serving with you again, sir.

758
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:41,333
Captain.

759
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,917
Course for Station McKinley
ready and laid in, sir.

760
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,041
Make it so, Number One.
