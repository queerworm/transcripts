00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,000
COMPUTER:
<i>Repulse</i> Shuttle has cleared
Docking Bay Three.

2
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,500
Open hailing frequencies.

3
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:51,125
Hailing
frequencies open.

4
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,291
<i>Repulse,</i>
this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

5
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,417
We are getting underway.

6
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,291
MAN:
Acknowledged,<i> Enterprise.</i>

7
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,792
Transfer complete.

8
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:58,834
Good luck on your mission.

9
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,041
And to you.

10
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,583
MAN:
Give my regards to your Captain.

11
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,542
<i>Repulse</i> out.

12
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,375
Shuttle Bay
is secure, sir.

13
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:06,917
Thank you, Mr. Crusher.

14
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,375
Make all preparations
to get underway.

15
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,375
We're constructing the enclosure
on Cargo Deck Five.

16
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:12,458
(<i> door chimes</i> )

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,834
Come.

18
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,375
The transfer's
been completed.

19
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:17,458
Dr. Pulaski is being shown
to her quarters.

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,875
We're ready
to get underway.

21
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:20,125
Grand.

22
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,542
Take a look
at the containment module

23
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,375
our Chief Engineer has designed.

24
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,166
"Chief Engineer"--
it still has a nice ring to it.

25
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:30,208
Each of these units will have
total environmental control--

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,000
gravity, temperature,
atmosphere, light--

27
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,041
all in a protective
stasis field.

28
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,125
And these get put
into the large containment unit?

29
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,625
Right.

30
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:40,875
See, these modules will keep
the specimens alive

31
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,792
but it's
this large containment area

32
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,792
that's going to keep us alive.

33
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:47,250
I have to go and replicate this
512 times

34
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,250
which means I'll have
to divert power

35
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,208
from the warp engines
to the replicator for a while.

36
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,375
Oh.

37
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:54,250
How long will we be
on impulse power?

38
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,291
Couple of hours.
Can't be helped.

39
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,959
When we leave 'audet IX
I'm going to need

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,041
all the power you can slam
into those warp engines.

41
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,792
You'll have it.

42
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:04,625
Number One, I'll
relieve you at 0300.

43
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:10,458
Take us out of orbit,
Mr. Crusher.

44
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,375
Set course for 'audet IX.

45
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:13,583
Aye, sir.

46
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,208
Course for 'audet IX
has been input.

47
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,959
Maximum impulse velocity.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,792
Aye, sir.

49
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:20,959
Engage.

50
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
Engineering,
this is Science One.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,667
I have just observed
what appeared to be

52
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,750
a random energy transference.

53
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:45,959
Where?

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,458
Aft. Outboard
of the port nacelle.

55
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,834
Hold on, I'll check.

56
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,959
No, I show nothing here, Data.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,375
Problem, Commander?

58
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:01,750
Possibility, sir.

59
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:03,375
An unexplained
power fluctuation.

60
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,041
You let me know
if it reoccurs.

61
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,250
Aye, sir.

62
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,542
(<i> tinkling whoosh</i> )

63
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:26,583
(<i> distorted voices</i> )

64
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,250
(<i> tinkling whoosh</i> )

65
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,375
Huh.

66
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,625
(<i> tinkling whoosh</i> )

67
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,458
(<i> groaning softly</i> )

68
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,875
(<i> tinkling whoosh</i> )

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,375
(<i> muted tinkling buzz</i> )

70
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,834
(<i> heavy breathing</i> )

71
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,208
(<i> gasping</i> )

72
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,291
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

73
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,166
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

74
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

75
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,000
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

76
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,083
<i>... to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

77
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:12,834
<i>... to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

78
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:14,083
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42073.1.</i>

79
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,917
<i>There has been an outbreak of</i>
<i>an unclassified</i>

80
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,000
<i>plasma plague</i>
<i>in the Rachelis System.</i>

81
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,458
<i>We're on an emergency run</i>

82
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,333
<i>to collect specimens</i>
<i>of the deadly plague</i>

83
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,417
<i>and transport them to</i>
<i>Science Station Tango Sierra</i>

84
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,417
<i>where hopefully an antidote</i>
<i>can be produced.</i>

85
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:30,083
How's it going?

86
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,208
Finished.

87
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,375
Just waiting
to insert the modules.

88
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,417
Number One.

89
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,333
Lieutenant La Forge
says we will be able

90
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,709
to engage the warp drive
within the hour.

91
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,875
Grand.

92
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,333
Mr. Data, when we have

93
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,041
a complete list
of all the specimens

94
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,333
we will be carrying,
I want you and Doctor, uh...

95
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,917
Pulaski, sir.

96
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,917
Dr. Pulaski.

97
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,000
I want you
to go through them.

98
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,125
Aye, sir.

99
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,917
By the way, where
is our new doctor?

100
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,291
Has she reported in?

101
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,417
Not yet.

102
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,208
Sick Bay, this
is the Captain.

103
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,750
MAN:
Sick Bay, aye.

104
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,166
Is Dr. Pulaski there?

105
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,291
MAN:
Uh, no, sir.

106
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,083
The Doctor is in Ten-Forward.

107
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,834
Thank you.

108
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,041
MAN:
Aye, sir.

109
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,417
A few hours on board

110
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,542
and already
she's found Ten-Forward?

111
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,542
I'll go get her.

112
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,625
No.

113
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,625
I'll go.

114
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,125
Not the best way
to meet your new Captain.

115
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,208
Deck Ten, Forward
Station One.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,041
Hello, Captain.

117
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:46,750
Ensign.

118
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,834
I'm, uh, sorry
this mission

119
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,583
will delay your reunion
with your mother.

120
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,208
That's all right.

121
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,291
It will give me
the time to finish

122
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,834
some projects
I have to do.

123
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,417
It's going to be hard
leaving the<i> Enterprise.</i>

124
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,125
Mixed feelings
for all of us.

125
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,542
It's always hard
leaving any ship.

126
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,375
Just as it was
for your mother

127
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:31,458
when she left to become
Head of Starfleet Medical.

128
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,417
But moving from one
assignment to another

129
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,166
is part of the life
which you're choosing.

130
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,917
I know.

131
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,667
But this isn't<i> any</i> ship.

132
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,500
How true.

133
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,500
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

134
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,834
Guinan.

135
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,834
Captain.

136
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,041
Where is Dr. Pulaski?

137
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:09,583
Thank you.

138
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,542
Dr. Katherine Pulaski?

139
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,625
Ah, you must be
Captain Picard.

140
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,250
Doctor, protocol may have been
lax on your last assignment

141
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,208
but here on the<i> Enterprise...</i>

142
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,208
Sit down, Captain.

143
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,542
You'd better listen to this.

144
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,709
Lieutenant La Forge,
status report.

145
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,375
LA FORGE:
The containment area
is completed, Captain

146
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,542
and the last of the modules
are being inserted.

147
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,291
Take us to warp six
as soon as possible.

148
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,583
Acknowledged.

149
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,208
This is Dr. Katherine Pulaski.

150
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,959
We'll handle
the formal introductions later.

151
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,917
Counselor Deanna Troi
is pregnant.

152
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:04,208
She...

153
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,417
she's going to have a baby.

154
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,500
A baby?

155
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,417
This is a surprise.

156
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,792
More so for me.

157
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,875
This pregnancy is unlike
anything I've ever encountered.

158
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,041
Since she came to me
a few hours ago

159
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,709
I have done two complete
examinations of Counselor Troi.

160
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,250
This is the first examination.

161
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,125
The fetus is about halfway
through the first trimester--

162
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,625
about six weeks old.

163
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,417
Now, understand, we believe

164
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,375
that conception took place
11 hours ago.

165
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:40,667
What?

166
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,291
PULASKI:
It gets better.

167
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,917
This is the second exam
one hour later.

168
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,083
Now it's consistent,
except for the fact

169
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,125
that it appears that the fetus
is several weeks older.

170
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,917
At this growth rate

171
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,542
Counselor Troi will have
her baby in about 36 hours.

172
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,792
The normal gestation rate
for a Betazoid is ten months.

173
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,792
I don't mean
to be indelicate...

174
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,417
... but who's
the father?

175
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,750
Last night, while I slept

176
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:15,417
something, which I can only
describe as a presence

177
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,834
entered my body.

178
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,208
PICARD:
A life-form of unknown
origin and intent

179
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,667
is breeding right now
inside Counselor Troi.

180
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,375
Our purpose here
is to determine

181
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:27,750
what is to be done about this.

182
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:28,750
Discussion.

183
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:29,792
Now wait.

184
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:30,792
Now, let me get
this straight.

185
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:32,583
Deanna was
impregnated by...

186
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,125
what?

187
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,333
Doctor, what do
the tests show?

188
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,500
Is it a humanoid?
An alien?

189
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:39,375
It's a male human.

190
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,709
Or in this case

191
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,250
half human, half Betazoid.

192
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,625
RIKER:
Exactly the same as Deanna.

193
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,458
PULASKI:
In every way.

194
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,333
PULASKI (<i> distantly</i> ): In fact,
there is nothing to indicate

195
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,166
that there are any genetic
patterns other than hers.

196
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,792
RIKER: I don't think
this is a random occurrence.

197
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:54,542
I think there's a purpose here,
and a reason.

198
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,959
What? I don't know.

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,500
WORF: Captain, obviously
the pregnancy must be terminated

200
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,750
for the safety
of the ship and the crew.

201
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:06,959
RIKER: Worf, you can't assume
the intent was belligerent.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,041
WORF:
That is the safest assumption.

203
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,000
DATA:
Captain, this is a life-form.

204
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,041
Not to allow it
to develop naturally

205
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,542
would deny us the opportunity
to study it.

206
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,083
WORF:
If the fetus is aborted

207
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,250
laboratory analysis
is still possible.

208
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:26,041
RIKER: Doctor, is there any
health risk to Counselor Troi

209
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,500
if the fetus is aborted?

210
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,792
Captain.

211
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,250
Do whatever you feel
is necessary

212
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:39,333
to protect the ship
and the crew, but know this--

213
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,166
I'm going to have this baby.

214
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,291
Then it seems
that the discussion is over.

215
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,375
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

216
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,333
<i>We have finally arrived</i>
<i>at 'audet IX</i>

217
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,834

218
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,750
<i>for transport to Rachelis.</i>

219
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:12,458
<i>It is only because</i>
<i>so many lives are at stake</i>

220
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,291
<i>that I'm willing to put</i>
<i>this ship and crew</i>

221
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,458
<i>at such great risk.</i>

222
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,083
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Counselor Troi's pregnancy</i>

223
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,917
<i>continues to progress</i>
<i>at an astonishing rate.</i>

224
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,250
How are you feeling?

225
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,709
I should be feeling
uncomfortable

226
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,834
with all the changes
in my body

227
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,000
but I don't, I feel fine.

228
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,333
Better
than fine--

229
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,750
wonderful.

230
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:44,792
Standard orbit.

231
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:47,250
Standard orbit, sir.

232
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,083
Open hailing frequencies.

233
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,917
WORF:
Hailing frequencies open.

234
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,083
'audet IX, this is
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

235
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,750
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

236
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,000
Ah, the<i> Enterprise.</i>

237
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:56,959
Here at last.

238
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Well, good,
let's get going.

239
00:13:59,041 --> 00:13:59,959
Excuse me.

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,250
To whom
am I speaking?

241
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,709
To whom are you speaking?

242
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,875
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Hester Dealt.

243
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:08,333
Medical trustee,
Federation Medical
Collection Station.

244
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,291
Are the specimens
ready for transfer?

245
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,875
Yes, but, with your permission,
I would like to inspect

246
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,333
the containment area
before we proceed.

247
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,875
Now, it's not
that I doubt

248
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:19,208
the ability of
your crew, Captain

249
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,041
but we cannot
afford a mistake.

250
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,583
I appreciate your caution.

251
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,583
In the like vain, I want
a complete detailed manifest

252
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,458
of everything you intend
to bring aboard my ship.

253
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,000
Very good.

254
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,250
I will allow you access
to my computer banks, okay?

255
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,875
PICARD:
Mr. Data, download
the inventory

256
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,792
and cross-reference it
with the medical computer.

257
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:41,250
Number One, arrange to have
Hester Dealt transported up.

258
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,583
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

259
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,959
<i>Although it's been</i>
<i>nearly 14 hours</i>

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,792
<i>since we arrived</i>
<i>at 'audet IX</i>

261
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:50,750
<i>Hester Dealt has still not</i>
<i>completed his inspection</i>

262
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,291
<i>of the containment unit.</i>

263
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,834
<i>The transfer</i>
<i>will not be permitted</i>

264
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,959
<i>until he is assured</i>
<i>of zero growth</i>

265
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,750
<i>during our voyage.</i>

266
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,333
<i>Meanwhile, the desperate pleas</i>

267
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,667
<i>from the Rachelis System</i>
<i>continue.</i>

268
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:04,291
Captain, the final manifest
has been received.

269
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,458
At last.

270
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,000
Review it with Dr. Pulaski.

271
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,583
I want you both to be
completely familiar with it.

272
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,667
Aye, sir.

273
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,417
Data, will you help me
get to Sick Bay?

274
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,041
It's time.

275
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,709
Oh, you bet it is.

276
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,792
Let's get you
to maternity.

277
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,083
Worf, assemble your
security team in Sick Bay.

278
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,250
Is that necessary?

279
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,208
Yes, Doctor.
Captain's orders.

280
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,959
Well, it's strange
to need armed guards

281
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,500
in a delivery room.

282
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,041
This way.

283
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,333
How frequent
are your contractions?

284
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,709
Very close together.

285
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,834
In my other
deliveries

286
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:46,834
except for a couple

287
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,000
the father was
always present.

288
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,917
Difficult
under the circumstances.

289
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,625
Perhaps I could serve
in that capacity?

290
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:52,917
Counselor Troi
is going to need

291
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,417
the comfort
of a human touch

292
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,291
and not the cold hand
of technology.

293
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,375
Doctor, I think Commander Data
will do very nicely.

294
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,625
Your choice.

295
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,917
You don't have
to do anything, Data

296
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,291
just be with me.

297
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,375
PULASKI: There's nothing
to be nervous about.

298
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,125
Nervous?

299
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,542
I find this
very interesting.

300
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:21,959
Although I understand
in technical terms

301
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,500
how life is formed

302
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:26,667
there is still a part
of the process which eludes me.

303
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,834
The child inside you--

304
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,917
are you able to access
his thought process?

305
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,375
Does he have thoughts?

306
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:34,458
You are aware of him.

307
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Is he aware of you?

308
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,125
When does that
awareness begin?

309
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,834
It's happening.

310
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:39,792
How does it feel?

311
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,000
Data.
Yes?

312
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,542
Now!
Now?

313
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,041
Now... now.
Doctor! Doctor!

314
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,625
Doctor!

315
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,417
This is an impatient baby.

316
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,625
He's eager
to make his appearance.

317
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,834
Now, do you want something
for the pain?

318
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,000
It will in no way
diminish the experience.

319
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,250
I have felt no pain.

320
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,291
None?

321
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,792
No.

322
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:02,875
None at all.

323
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,041
PULASKI:
Have your security men
stand back.

324
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,583
I understand the importance
of having you here

325
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,875
but keep out from underfoot.

326
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,917
(<i> Deanna breathing heavily</i> )

327
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,250
PULASKI:
Fetal position?

328
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,959
NURSE:
Normal.

329
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,667
Fetal pulse?

330
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:19,917
137.

331
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,875
PULASKI:
The baby is showing healthy
respiratory movements.

332
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,750
Reaction of the heart
rate is good.

333
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,041
(<i> panting</i> )

334
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,709
The baby's doing
wonderfully, Troi.

335
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:42,834
Breathe slowly.

336
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,375
You're doing great.

337
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,458
Stay calm.

338
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,291
That's it, there it is.

339
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,250
(<i> Troi gasps</i> )

340
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,333
I've got him.

341
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,333
You can relax.

342
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,750
(<i> baby crying</i> )

343
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,250
(<i> crying stops</i> )

344
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,000
There, there, that's a good boy.

345
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,709
Okay.

346
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,625
Oh, my...

347
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:42,834
he's beautiful.

348
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,667
Are easy births

349
00:18:58,709 --> 00:18:59,750
the norm for Betazoids?

350
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:02,166
Not according to my mother.

351
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:07,917
You can come in
the rest of the way now.

352
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,291
PULASKI:
There's no threat, Lieutenant.

353
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,834
You and your men can relax.

354
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,083
It's just a baby.

355
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,083
Thank you for allowing me
to participate.

356
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,000
It was remarkable.

357
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,166
Do you have a name?

358
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,291
Ian Andrew,
after my father.

359
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,417
Were you here
all along?

360
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,750
Yes.

361
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,291
He's beautiful, Deanna.

362
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,041
Just like his mother.

363
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:17,709
How do you feel?

364
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,250
Fine.

365
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,333
Wonderful.

366
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,000
Thank you, Doctor,
for everything.

367
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,291
Amazing.

368
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:47,917
Captain.

369
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,542
Doctor, welcome
to the Bridge.

370
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,000
Please sit down.

371
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,000
How is Counselor Troi?

372
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,917
Did she have a good night?

373
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,375
I've delivered
dozens of babies

374
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:59,000
but none like this.

375
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,125
There was no pain,
no trauma.

376
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,250
It's true.

377
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,834
It was effortless
for both of them.

378
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,959
I'm not sure of your point.

379
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,417
She had her baby
yesterday.

380
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,166
If I were to examine her now

381
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,083
I would not be able to tell
she had a baby

382
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,375
or had ever had a baby.

383
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:18,291
It was as if the incident
never happened.

384
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,875
Data, how long before
we begin the transfer?

385
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:25,709
Two hours,
19 minutes, sir.

386
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,125
Number One,
you have the Bridge.

387
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,250
Aye, sir.

388
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,417
You will accompany me,
Doctor, please.

389
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,375
I think it's time
I paid my respects.

390
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,417
(<i> door chimes</i> )

391
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,542
TROI:
Come in.

392
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,041
Deanna, I wanted
to see how you were

393
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,041
and have a look

394
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,208
at your...

395
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:54,500
baby.

396
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:55,583
My goodness.

397
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,291
How old is he?

398
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,667
In actuality, a day.

399
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,375
Yes, but...

400
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:11,333
In appearance,
almost four Earth years old.

401
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,458
Ian...

402
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,250
say hello to Captain Picard.

403
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,667
You mean he can talk?

404
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,750
Hello.

405
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,250
Hello, Ian.

406
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,291
Please don't worry.

407
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,583
Everything is okay.

408
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,291
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

409
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,875
<i>We are faced</i>
<i>with two major problems--</i>

410
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:49,583
<i>Troi's child and the deadly</i>
<i>cargo we're about to take on.</i>

411
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:52,208
<i>In the hours since his birth</i>

412
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,917
<i>Troi's baby has continued</i>
<i>his rapid growth</i>

413
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,333
<i>and now appears,</i>
<i>physically and mentally</i>

414
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,458
<i>to be a child of eight.</i>

415
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,792
<i>Still, there is no indication</i>

416
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:03,667
<i>as to who he is</i>
<i>or why he is here.</i>

417
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:05,291
Sick Bay,
this is the Bridge.

418
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,875
We are ready to begin loading.

419
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,208
PULASKI:
We need a little more time.

420
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,750
It's taking longer
than we anticipated

421
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,333
to categorize these specimens.

422
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:14,000
Data, look at this.

423
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,792
"Day-ta."

424
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,166
What?

425
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:23,083
My name-- it is
pronounced "day-ta."

426
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,709
Oh?

427
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,375
You called me "dah-ta."

428
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:28,083
What's the difference?

429
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,333
One is my name;
the other is not.

430
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,250
Is this possible?

431
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:44,375
With all your neural nets,
algorithms and heuristics

432
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:46,542
is there some combination
that makes up a circuit

433
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,667
for bruised feelings?

434
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,166
Possible?

435
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,500
I am unfamiliar
with this symbol.

436
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,208
It indicates
a genetically-engineered

437
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,041
biological life-form.

438
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:09,250
About 20% of the specimens
fall into that category.

439
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:12,208
Some eager beaver at play.

440
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,125
Query.

441
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,250
"Eager beaver"?

442
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,959
Well, in this case,
"eager beaver"

443
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,291
refers to some overachieving
genetic engineer

444
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:27,375
who, probably because of lack
of anything better to do

445
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:30,875
has forced this strain
of virus to mutate

446
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:34,000
just so he can see
how bad "bad" can get.

447
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,542
Captain Picard.

448
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,208
Picard.

449
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,458
I just wanted you to know
what risks we're about to take.

450
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,250
Go on.

451
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:49,125
If the most innocuous specimen
on the manifest list gets loose

452
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:52,041
it will destroy all life
on the<i> Enterprise</i>

453
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,125
in a matter of hours.

454
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,166
I understand, Doctor.

455
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,750
Do you have a recommendation?

456
00:24:57,792 --> 00:25:01,291
Considering how desperately
this is needed, no, I don't.

457
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,083
I just wanted you to know
what we were carrying.

458
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,709
Thank you.

459
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,041
Commander Data, if you've
completed your review

460
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,417
you're needed
in Transporter Room Three.

461
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,709
Aye, sir.

462
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,083
Excuse me, Doctor.

463
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,625
That's all right, Data--

464
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,250
"day-ta," whatever.

465
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:18,583
(<i> laughter</i> )

466
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,959
It's so soft.

467
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,375

Look at his tail.

Ian.

470
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,083
Ian.

471
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,583
He's a very
tactile child.

472
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,125
He wants to touch
and feel everything.

473
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,542
It's time to go,
sweetheart.

474
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,750
Unbelievable.

475
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,208
I think he's actually grown
since you dropped him off.

476
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,291
I like it here, Mommy.

477
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,166
I thought you would.

478
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,875
Say thank you to Miss Gladstone
for having you

479
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,041
and let's go get
something to eat.

480
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,542
Thank you.

481
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,000
Bye.

482
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,083
Thank you.

Cargo Deck Five, we will
commence transportation

485
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,625
on your command.

486
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:29,375

we are ready to receive.

488
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,667
Mm-hmm.

is in place

490
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:52,750

00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,834
You'll inform me

493

and the cargo secure?

494
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,083
Aye, sir.

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,542
Come in.

497
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,500
I wanted to stop by
and see how Ian was doing.

498
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,041
We're doing fine.

499
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,291
I was just about
to get him his supper.

500
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,208
Do you want
your supper now, too?

501
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,125
Um, no, Ian, but thank you
for the invitation.

502
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,208
You're welcome.

503
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:43,959
Have you ever played
with puppies?

504
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,709
They had a litter
today in the nursery.

505
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,166
No, Ian.

506
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,083
I don't think
I've played with puppies.

507
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,333
You should come to the nursery

508
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:54,166
while the puppies
are still there.

509
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,291
Perhaps later.

510
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:03,500
Ow!

511
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,792
Mom!

512
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,583
Ow.

513
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,041
Here, let me see that.

514
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:15,375
That's not so bad.

515
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,083
My face is wet.

516
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,208
Is that better,
sweetheart?

517
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,959
Everything's
going to be fine.

518
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,041
He allowed himself
to be burned.

519
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,917
Mm-hmm,
for the experience.

520
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,709
Who is he?

521
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,458
Why is
he here?

522
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,583
What does
he want?

523
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:48,667
Ian, could you tell us
why you're here?

524
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,834
Because Mommy said
it was time to eat.

525
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:57,125
No, I mean, why are you here
on this ship?

526
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,250
I live here.

527
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:01,041
Ian, I think
the Captain

528
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,750
wants to know if you're ready
to tell us why you came here.

529
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:06,333
No, not yet.

530
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:18,291
The answer
is within him.

531
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:21,083
When his cognitive powers
are sufficiently developed

532
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,917
he will be able
to articulate it.

533
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,458
I hope he will
tell us soon.

534
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,583
Cargo's been loaded
and is secure.

535
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,500
Then take us out
of orbit, Number One.

536
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:34,542
Set a course for
Rachelis, warp six.

537
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:59,500
(<i> inaudible</i> )

538
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:02,583
Excuse me.

539
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,375
Can I get you something?

540
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,333
No, nothing.

541
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,291
I just like
to stand here.

542
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,667
I don't blame you.

543
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:17,000
It's beautiful.

544
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,375
Yeah.

545
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:23,208
How about a nice cup
of Mareuvian tea?

546
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,792
No, nothing,
thank you.

547
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,834
You'll be leaving soon.

548
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:35,583
Yeah.

549
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,458
What do you see when
you look out there?

550
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,834
The Lorenze cluster

551
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,709
and there's Arneb

552
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,583
and there's
Epsilon Indi.

553
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,291
That's not what I mean.

554
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:10,208
I mean, when you look out there,
don't you see your future?

555
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,375
It will still be there.

556
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,417
What about a cup of nectar
direct from Prometheus?

557
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,583
No, nothing.

558
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,667
That's the third time
you've asked me.

559
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:28,375
It's what I'm
expected to do.

560
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,250
Don't you always do
what's expected?

561
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,542
I try.

562
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,709
Even if it's not
what you really want?

563
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,834
Sometimes.

564
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,709
Sometimes
it's more important

565
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,583
to consider others
before yourself.

566
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,125
Yes...

567
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,625
but sometimes the game

568
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:52,500
is to know when to consider
yourself<i> before</i> others--

569
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:54,375
give yourself permission
to be selfish.

570
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

571
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:15,625
DEALT:
Something's wrong.

572
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,333
What is it?
Growth.

573
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:20,792
Where?

574
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:21,875
L-seven-three.

575
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:26,083
Bridge, this is
Cargo Deck Five.

576
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,125
Yes, La Forge?

577
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,375
Captain, we have a...

578
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,125
a malfunction
in the containment area.

579
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,625
How serious?

580
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:34,750
Very.

581
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,583
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

582
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,166
<i>For reasons as yet unknown</i>

583
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:45,083
<i>one of the deadly specimens</i>
<i>of plasma plague</i>

584
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,375
<i>has begun to grow.</i>

585
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:48,959
Report, Mr. La Forge.

586
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,458
Captain, we've checked
everything.

587
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,583
There's no reason
for this to be happening.

588
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:55,000
I can't even isolate
the cause of the problem.

589
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,959
Come on, Data, we'd
better get down there.

590
00:32:58,834 --> 00:32:59,750
Dr. Pulaski.

591
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,333
Yes, Captain?

592
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:03,792
They're having a little
difficulty on Cargo Deck Five.

593
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:05,250
Your presence is requested.

594
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:06,417
I'm on my way.

595
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:14,959
You never talk
about yourself.

596
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,709
Sure I do--

597
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,625
all the time.

598
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,333
People say
you're very old.

599
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,500
Oh?

600
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,542
And that you knew
Captain Picard

601
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,083
when he was
on the<i> Stargazer.</i>

602
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:28,875
No, I never knew
the Captain

603
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:30,333
till I came
on board.

604
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,458
Well, everyone's
very curious about you.

605
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,917
Yes, I'll bet they are.

606
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,458
Yeah, they, they want to
know where you're from.

607
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,125
And where do they say?

608
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,291
Well, they say
that you're

609
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,625
from Nova Kron
and that, uh...

610
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:49,458
PICARD: Mr. Crusher,
report to the Bridge.

611
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Aye, sir.

612
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:51,625
Got to go.

613
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:00,709
Thanks.

614
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,250
For a dish of Delovian soufflé?

615
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,041
No, not for the soufflé.

616
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,750
I meant for the rest.

617
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,250
That's why I'm here.

618
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,166
Thanks.

619
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:19,917
Bye.

620
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:27,333
RIKER: Why this module
and not the others?

621
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:31,834
Computer, run diagnostic
on module L-seven-three.

622
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,500
COMPUTER:
All circuits functional.

623
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,709
LA FORGE:
Environments
as programmed.

624
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,250
Temperature-- 97 degrees Kelvin.

625
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:41,792
Radiation flux-- zero.

626
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:43,083
Stasis field nominal.

627
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,917
Everything exactly
the way it should be

628
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,709
right down the line.

629
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,166
Perhaps it is a sensor
malfunction.

630
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,000
Computer, inquiry--

631
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:54,208
is growth actually occurring
in module L-seven-three?

632
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,458
COMPUTER:
Confirmed.

633
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,166
Doctor, one of the
specimens is growing.

634
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,333
Destroy it now.

635
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,750
I can't.

636
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:05,500
Data, prepare
to jettison the module.

637
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:06,917
We can't do that either.

638
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,542
It will go into a spore
and remain

639
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:11,417
until it comes into contact
with a planet or another ship

640
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,542
and the results
will be disastrous.

641
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:14,792
Commander,
your attitude tells me

642
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,959
that no matter how bad
I think it is

643
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,166
it's actually worse?

644
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,625
This is not going to hold it.

645
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:20,959
Go on.

646
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,792
DEALT: The rate growth
is increasing so rapidly

647
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:25,458
within 30 minutes it's going
to push out of its module.

648
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,875
Within two hours, it will break
out of the containment area.

649
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,583
No, no, no.
It can't break through<i> this.</i>

650
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:30,709
Yes, it will.

651
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,750
Captain,
we may not be able

652
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:37,709
to get control
of this situation.

653
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,000
I recommend
we arrange a transfer

654
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:40,750
of all
non-essential personnel

655
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:42,083
to the saucer section.

656
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,750
And if we lose containment

657
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,667
we should be
prepared to separate.

658
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:47,125
Make it so.

659
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:49,959
Why this one specimen
and none of the others?

660
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,375
Something is
stimulating it.

661
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,041
Do you have
the etiology--

662
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,417
do you know how
it was developed?

663
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,542
Yes.

664
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:57,792
It's right over here.

665
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,625
It's a mutated strain

666
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,166
developed
by Dr. Susan Nuress

667
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,417
during an outbreak
of plasma plague

668
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,417
70 years ago
in the Oby System.

669
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:13,041
It was number nine
in a series of 58 tests.

670
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,667
This particular one
bombarded

671
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:17,750
by low levels
of Eichner radiation.

672
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,917
Could exposure to Eichner
radiation stimulate growth?

673
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,500
It could, but I...

674
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,333
I've got some.

675
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,417
Why didn't you detect
this before?

676
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,625
I don't know.

677
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:35,750
It wasn't here before.

678
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:36,834
Well, it is now.

679
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,917
What emits that type
of radiation?

680
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:40,667
A subspace
phase inverter.

681
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:41,917
We don't
have one.

682
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,458
Certain
cyanoacrylates.

683
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,458
Also not on this ship.

684
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,667
What else?

685
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:47,083
Because it's here
and we better find it.

686
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:05,917
I can feel that
some of the people
are very worried.

687
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:08,000
Yes, I feel it, too.

688
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:10,166
But don't you worry.

689
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:12,208
It's me, Mommy.

690
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,333
I'm the reason.

691
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,583
What?

692
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,166
It's me.

693
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:20,792
You?

694
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:21,834
Yes.

695
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,041
I have to leave you now

696
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,667
or it will be very bad
for everyone.

697
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:27,250
What are you saying?

698
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,625
I have to leave now.

699
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,875
Leave?

700
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:37,291
You're going to die.

701
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,333
No, you can't!

702
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,000
Sick Bay,
this is Counselor Troi.

703
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,208
I need the Doctor
in my quarters now!

704
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,333
Ian!

705
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,834
Ian, no! Ian!

706
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,250
It's Ian! Hurry!

707
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:57,959
PULASKI:
What happened?

708
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,625
Did he eat anything?
Did he fall?

709
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:00,792
No.

710
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:03,083
Commander,
the child is the source

711
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,000
of the unusual radiation.

712
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,709
Ian said he's the reason
the ship is in danger.

713
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,000
That analysis is correct.

714
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,667
I'm losing life signs.

715
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,625
You must save him.

Thank you, Lieutenant.

725
00:39:58,875 --> 00:39:59,959
Then Ian was right.

726
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,458
He was the cause.

727
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,792
Apparently so.

728
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:16,250
He is a life-force entity.

729
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,792
When we passed each other
in space

730
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,875
he was curious about us

731
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:25,417
so he decided the best
way to learn was

732
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,417
to go though
the process.

733
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,000
To be born...

734
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,291
to live as one of us

735
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,125
and, in that way,
to understand us.

736
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,000
He never meant
any harm.

737
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:39,542
There was a moment
when you smiled.

738
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:45,792
He said, "Thank you."

739
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:51,000
I told him we will miss him.

740
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:55,959
And I will.

741
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,291
(<i> door opens</i> )

742
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:08,875
(<i> door closes</i> )

743
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:10,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

744
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,417
Standard station orbit,
Mr. Crusher.

745
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:21,834
Aye, sir.
Standard orbit.

746
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,583
Transporter Room Three,
this is the Captain.

747
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:25,083
We have arrived.

748
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:28,583
Let's make this transfer
with all deliberate speed.

749
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:29,750
Aye, sir.

750
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:33,000
I'll be glad
to be relieved
of this cargo.

751
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,417
You have the Bridge,
Number One.

752
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:39,166
Captain...

753
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,250
could I see you when
you have a moment?

754
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,959
In my Ready Room
when your duties permit.

755
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,041
Thank you, sir.

756
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:47,166
How long is it
going to take

757
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,834
to develop
a vaccine?

758
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,125
We may never develop one.

759
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,291
Then all of this might
have been in vain?

760
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:54,750
No, let's hope not.

761
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:56,375
DATA:
Stand by to energize.

762
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:58,667
Good luck.

763
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,333
Data, you can lock
onto the first group

764
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,125
and begin transporting
on my mark.

765
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:10,625
(<i> door chimes</i> )

766
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:11,750
Come.

767
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:17,959
Captain Picard, I've
thought about this a lot.

768
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,667
I want to remain
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

769
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,875
(<i> beeps</i> )

770
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:27,792
Have you discussed this
with your mother?

771
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:29,417
No, sir.

772
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:30,500
Before I do that

773
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:31,792
I'd like your permission
to stay.

774
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:36,917
Wesley, it's a little more
complicated than that.

775
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:38,959
Captain

776
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,500
this is where
I want to be.

777
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,500
This is where
I feel I belong.

778
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:46,792
RIKER:
Captain, transfer complete.

779
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:48,417
We are ready to leave orbit.

780
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,834
Make it so, Number One.

781
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:51,000
Return to your position.

782
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,417
(<i> beeps</i> )

783
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:10,625
RIKER:
All systems secure.

784
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:12,583
Take us out of orbit,
Mr. Crusher.

785
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,458
Lay in a course
for the Morgana quadrant.

786
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,125
Yes, sir.

787
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:19,542
Ensign Crusher has requested
to remain on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

788
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:20,542
I'm not surprised.

789
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:21,542
How did you respond?

790
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:23,000
I haven't as yet,
Number One.

791
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,417
I didn't think that it was
my responsibility alone.

792
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:27,959
His remaining will create
difficulties for all of us.

793
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,375
Yes, indeed.

794
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:31,375
With his mother gone,
who will see to his studies?

795
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:32,959
Exactly.

796
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,125
Of course

797
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:36,792
that duty will fall
to Commander Data.

798
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:38,709
And who will tuck
him in at night?

799
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,166
Come on, Commander.

800
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:42,959
I will accept
that responsibility.

801
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:46,625
Well, we know
he'll get his sleep.

802
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,792
PICARD:
Well, then, that takes care
of the practical

803
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,458
but there's more to
growing up than that.

804
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:55,000
You know, it's my
belief, Number One

805
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:57,166
that you're best qualified
to supervise that.

806
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:59,625
You willing
to serve?

807
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:00,834
Difficult decision.

808
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:06,500
Yes, I can do that.

809
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:08,458
PICARD: Now, Mr. Crusher,
communicate with your mother

810
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,834
at Starfleet
Medical Headquarters.

811
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:11,041
Give her my regards

812
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:12,291
and tell her that you
have my permission

813
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:14,083
to remain on
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

814
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,417
But I will abide
by her wishes.

815
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:18,583
Yes, sir.

816
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:19,542
Thank you, sir.

817
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,083
I know she'll agree.

818
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,291
Now, you have course
and speed laid in?

819
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,041
Yes, sir, they are.

820
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:27,333
Then, Mr. Crusher,
engage.
