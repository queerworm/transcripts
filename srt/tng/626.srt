1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:05,125
But then I said,
"In that frame of reference,

2
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:07,500
"the perihelion of Mercury

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,083
would have precessed in
the opposite direction."

4
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:12,709
(<i> laughing</i> )

5
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:14,750
That is a
great story.

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,041
Quite amusing, Dr. Hawking.

7
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,250
You see, Sir Isaac,

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,000
the joke depends
on an understanding

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,542
of the relativistic curvature
of space-time.

10
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:25,875
If two non-inertial reference
frames are in relative--

11
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,000
Do not patronize me, sir.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,750
I invented physics.

13
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,041
The day that apple
fell on my head

14
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,250
was the most momentous day
in the history of science.

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,792
Not the apple story again.

16
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,417
That story is generally
considered to be apocryphal.

17
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:43,625
What?! How dare you?!

18
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,375
Perhaps we should
return to the game, hmm?

19
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,750
Now, let's see,
where were we?

20
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,333
Yes, you raised Mr. Data four,

21
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,041
which means that,
um, the bet is...

22
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,208
seven to me?

23
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,333
The bet is ten.

24
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,000
Can't you do simple arithmetic?

25
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,333
(<i> sighs</i> )
I don't even know

26
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,166
why I'm here in the
first place.

27
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,792
What is the point of
playing this ridiculous game?

28
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,041
When I play poker
with my shipmates,

29
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,333
it often appears to
be a useful forum

30
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,834
for exploring the different
facets of humanity.

31
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:17,000
I was curious to see how
three of history's

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,125
greatest minds
would interact

33
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,667
in this setting.

34
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:24,917
So far, it has proved
to be most illuminating.

35
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,375
And profitable.
(<i> chuckles</i> )

36
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,500
Can we get this
over with, please?

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,291
It's your bet.

38
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,792
I raise 50.

39
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:37,041
Blast! I fold.

40
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,000
I fold as well.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,375
The uncertainty principle will
not help you now, Stephen, hmm?

42
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,083
All the quantum fluctuations

43
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,709
in the universe
will not change

44
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,250
the cards
in your hand.

45
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,667
I call.

46
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:54,250
You are bluffing,
and you will lose.

47
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,625
Wrong again, Albert.

48
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,458
Well... hmm.

49
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,542
RIKER: Red alert. All personnel
report to duty stations.

50
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:09,917
We will have to
continue this another time.

51
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,709
End program.

52
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,250
RIKER: We've received
a distress call

53
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,792
from the Ohniaka III
outpost.

54
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,625
They said they
were under attack.

55
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,458
Ohniaka III?

56
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,792
There's no strategic
value to that outpost.

57
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:35,375
Were they able to
identify the attackers?

58
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,667
No, we haven't been
able to raise them

59
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:37,959
since the initial contact.

60
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,875
We are entering the
Ohniaka system, sir.

61
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,125
Bring us out of warp, Ensign.

62
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,709
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

63
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:45,417
Sensors detect one ship
orbiting the third planet.

64
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:48,417
Its configuration does not match
anything in our records.

65
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,667
Stand by phasers
and photon torpedoes.

66
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,208
Hail them, Mr. Worf.

67
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,250
No response, sir.

68
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,166
Put them on screen.

69
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,917
It does not appear to be
attacking the outpost, sir.

70
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:03,542
They might have attacked
before we got here.

71
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:07,500
Or they might simply
be another victim.

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,083
What about the outpost?

73
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,500
There is a great deal of
electromagnetic interference.

74
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,792
I am unable to determine

75
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,792
whether there are
any life-forms present.

76
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,625
Worf, Data,
you're with me.

77
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,834
These wounds were caused
by a forced-plasma beam

78
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:45,959
similar to a Ferengi
hand phaser.

79
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,041
This looks brutal,
even for the Ferengi.

80
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,709
Any sign of the survivors?

81
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,917
Electromagnetic interference
is still making it difficult

82
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:53,750
to get a
precise reading.

83
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,667
How many people were assigned
to this outpost?

84
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:58,041
274.

85
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,750
All right, we're gonna need
to do a room-to-room search.

86
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,083
Worf, you and Corelki start
searching the north wing.

87
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,417
You and I'll take the south.
Aye, sir.

88
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:17,125
Mechanism appears
to be jammed, sir.

89
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,000
RIKER:
There's not much damage.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,542
Doesn't look like
they were interested

91
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,500
in the station--
just the people.

92
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,041
I have bypassed
the primary system.

93
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:06,458
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

94
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:10,500
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

95
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

96
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,625
<i>to explore</i>

97
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:20,041
<i>to seek out new life</i>

98
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:24,709
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

99
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,959
Evasive maneuvers, Ensign.
Return fire.

100
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,750
Shields down to 80%.

101
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,291
Compensating with
auxiliary power.

102
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,709
You have killed Torsus.

103
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,875
I will make you
suffer for this.

104
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:13,000
Biological organism-- Klingon.

105
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,917
Biological organism-- human.

106
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,875
(<i> grunts</i> )

107
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,500
Stop it.

108
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,417
Stop.

109
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,834
Stop! Stop!

110
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,375
Stop!
Stop!

111
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,083
Artificial life-form.

112
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,458
Starfleet rank--
Lieutenant Commander.

113
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,125
Name-- Data.

114
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,125
LA FORGE: Captain, the alien
ship is breaking orbit.

115
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,083
Plot an intercept
course, Ensign.

116
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,667
Fire torpedoes.

117
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,291
They're gone, sir.

118
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,917
Our sensors indicate
there was some kind

119
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:32,959
of subspace distortion
just before they disappeared.

120
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,500
I'll have to study
these readings

121
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,041
before I can get any
more specific than that.

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,750
Take us back to Ohniaka III.

123
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,834
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

124
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,166
Data?

125
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,166
Data, are you
all right?

126
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,500
Yes, sir.

127
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,250
What happened?

128
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,500
I got angry.

129
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,917
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46982.1.</i>

130
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:18,166
<i>Because of his unusual behavior</i>
<i>on the planet's surface,</i>

131
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:22,125
<i>Commander Data has asked to be</i>
<i>temporarily relieved of duty.</i>

132
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,417
<i>Unfortunately, this means</i>
<i>he will not be able</i>

133
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:27,166
<i>to help us investigate</i>
<i>a disturbing new change</i>

134
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,542
<i>in the behavior of the Borg.</i>

135
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:33,083
They were fast, aggressive,
almost vicious.

136
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,333
It was more like fighting

137
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,166
Klingons... than Borg.
No offense.

138
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,375
None taken.

139
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,166
There was another
difference.

140
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,083
I don't believe they were
part of the Borg collective.

141
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,417
I think they were
acting as individuals.

142
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,917
What?

143
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:49,333
One of them referred
to himself as "I."

144
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,667
And that Borg showed
concern for a fallen comrade.

145
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,792
He even called
him by name.

146
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:57,792
The only Borg who had
a name was Hugh,

147
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,500
and we gave it to him.

148
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,083
Maybe Hugh has something to do

149
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,875
with this change
in their behavior.

150
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,750
Did they show any interest

151
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,041
in assimilating you
or your technology?

152
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,917
They seemed more concerned
with the death

153
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,875
of their colleague
and with destroying us.

154
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,333
I didn't see anything
that suggested

155
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,417
they wanted
to assimilate anybody.

156
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:20,083
The Borg's entire existence
was centered around

157
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,583
acquiring cultures
and technology.

158
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,875
If that's changed,

159
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,041
then they must
have a new objective.

160
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,250
We have to find out
what it is.

161
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,458
Mr. Worf, from this moment on,

162
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,291
I want to maintain
a level-2 security alert.

163
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,875
Post armed officers
on every deck.

164
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,333
Aye, sir.
Number One,

165
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,625
I want you to analyze

166
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,750
our sensor readings
of the Borg ship.

167
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,542
Try to determine if it was
something they constructed

168
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:48,208
or an alien ship
that they captured.

169
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,959
Then run an analysis of
this subspace distortion

170
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,667
they used to escape.
Aye, sir.

171
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,542
I'm gonna contact
Starfleet Command.

172
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:00,959
Hmm.

173
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,750
Well, your positronic
net checks out.

174
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,083
Everything else looks fine.

175
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,041
My internal diagnostic
also finds nothing wrong.

176
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,625
I don't know, Data.
There's nothing here

177
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,291
that would indicate anything
that might cause

178
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,583
any sort of
behavioral anomaly.

179
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,625
I agree.

180
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,875
Geordi...

181
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,083
I believe I have experienced
my first emotion.

182
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,792
No offense, Data,
but how would you know

183
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:35,250
a flash of anger from
some odd kind of power surge?

184
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,834
You are correct in that I have
no frame of reference

185
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:41,083
to confirm my hypothesis.

186
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,542
In fact,
I am unable to provide

187
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:45,583
a verbal description
of the experience.

188
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,375
Perhaps you could describe
how it feels to be angry.

189
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,875
I could then use
that as a reference.

190
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,709
Yeah, okay.

191
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:58,166
Well, when I
feel angry,

192
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,208
first, I, uh...

193
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:06,542
first, I feel... hostile.

194
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:09,959
Could you describe
feeling hostile?

195
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,583
Well, yeah, it's
like feeling...

196
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,917
belligerent, combative.

197
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,792
Could you describe
feeling angry

198
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:20,291
without referring
to other feelings?

199
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
No, I guess I can't.

200
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,625
I just...
feel angry.

201
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,583
That was my
experience as well.

202
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:36,208
I simply felt angry.

203
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,750
Well, let's say you're right
and this is a real emotion.

204
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,542
How is that
possible?

205
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:48,083
I do not know.

206
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,834
Perhaps I have
evolved to the point

207
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:53,625
where emotions are
within my grasp.

208
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,959
Perhaps I will experience
other emotions as time goes by.

209
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,041
Well, I hope you're right.

210
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,917
I'd hate to think
that anger

211
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:03,125
is all you're
capable of feeling.

212
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:09,208
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46984.6.</i>

213
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,667
<i>No additional Borg attacks</i>
<i>have been reported</i>

214
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,291
<i>in the past two days.</i>

215
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,208
<i>However, Starfleet has</i>
<i>dispatched Admiral Nechayev</i>

216
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,875
<i>to take command in this sector</i>

217
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,875
<i>in preparation</i>
<i>for a possible Borg invasion.</i>

218
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,917
There will be 15 starships
in this sector

219
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:25,667
by the day
after tomorrow.

220
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,792
The<i> Gorkon</i> will be
my flagship.

221
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,709
You'll take command
of task force three

222
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,000
consisting of
the<i> Enterprise,</i>

223
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,291
the<i> Crazy Horse,</i> 
and the<i> Agamemnon.</i>

224
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,166
Understood.

225
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,125
Captain, I've read the report

226
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,250
that you submitted
to Admiral Brooks last year

227
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,125
regarding the Borg
you called "Hugh",

228
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,000
and I've been trying to figure
out why you let him go.

229
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:50,542
I thought that I had
made that clear.

230
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:51,875
As I understand it,

231
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,625
you found a single Borg
at a crash site,

232
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,667
brought it aboard
the<i> Enterprise,</i>

233
00:13:56,667 --> 00:14:01,542
studied it, analyzed it,
and eventually found a way

234
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,500
to send it back to the Borg
with a program

235
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,458
that would have destroyed
the entire collective

236
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,291
once and for all.

237
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,917
But instead, you nursed
the Borg back to health,

238
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,792
treated it like a guest,
gave it a name

239
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,834
and then sent it home.

240
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:17,166
Why?

241
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,667
When Hugh was separated
from the Borg collective,

242
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:23,083
he began to grow, to evolve
into something

243
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,250
other than an automaton.

244
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,625
He became a person.

245
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,834
When that happened,
I felt I had no choice

246
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:33,542
but to respect his rights
as an individual.

247
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,083
Of course you had a choice.

248
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,667
You could have taken
the opportunity to rid

249
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,291
the Federation of
a mortal enemy--

250
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,166
one that has killed
tens of thousands

251
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,750
of innocent people,
and which may kill even more.

252
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,959
No one is more aware
of the danger than I am.

253
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:51,709
But I'm also bound by my oath
and my conscience

254
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:54,875
to uphold certain principles.

255
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,041
And I will not sacrifice
them in order to--

256
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,750
Your priority
is to safeguard

257
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,500
the lives of
Federation citizens,

258
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,250
not to wrestle with
your conscience.

259
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,208
Now, I want
to make it clear

260
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,000
that if you have a similar
opportunity in the future--

261
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,458
an opportunity to
destroy the Borg--

262
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,834
you are under orders
to take advantage of it.

263
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,709
Is that understood?

264
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes, sir.

265
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,083
For the past six hours

266
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,875
I have attempted to produce
an emotional response

267
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,500
by subjecting myself
to various stimuli.

268
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,291
Like what?

269
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,125
I listened to several operas
known to be uplifting.

270
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,083
I watched three
holodeck programs

271
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,250
designed to be humorous,
and I made four attempts

272
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,875
to induce sexual desire

273
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:50,166
by subjecting myself
to erotic imagery.

274
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,542
What happened?

275
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,083
Nothing.

276
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,709
I'm curious.

277
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,834
Why are you ignoring
the one emotion

278
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,792
you've already experienced?

279
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,333
Why aren't you trying to
make yourself angry again?

280
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,667
Anger is a negative emotion.

281
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:09,083
I wanted to concentrate
on something more positive.

282
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,834
Data, feelings aren't
positive and negative.

283
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:14,500
They simply exist.

284
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,542
It's what we do
with those feelings

285
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,125
that becomes
good or bad.

286
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,917
(<i> sighs</i> )
For example,

287
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:25,458
feeling angry about an
injustice could lead someone

288
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,208
to take a positive action
to correct it.

289
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:31,166
But my study of
humanity indicates

290
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,500
that there are some emotions

291
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,959
that are harmful,
such as jealousy

292
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,083
or hatred.

293
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,250
Those are very strong emotions,

294
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,875
and you're right--
very little good

295
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,875
can come from them.
But I don't think that

296
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,917
an exploration of anger

297
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:50,709
need necessarily
lead to hatred or malice.

298
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,417
But what if it does,
Counselor?

299
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:54,917
What if those are
the only emotions

300
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:57,750
I am capable of experiencing?

301
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,333
Would that not make me
a bad person?

302
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,917
We've served together
for a long time,

303
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:14,458
and I think I've come
to know you pretty well.

304
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,125
I have to believe
if you ever reach

305
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,125
your goal of
becoming human...

306
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,083
you won't become a bad one.

307
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:29,333
I wish I were as confident
as you, Counselor.

308
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,000
When I was fighting
the Borg, I felt angry.

309
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:38,041
But when I think back
on the incident,

310
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,166
I realize that
I was also experiencing

311
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,041
another sensation.

312
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,291
It was not the
same as anger,

313
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,125
but I think it
was an emotion.

314
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,208
When exactly did you
feel this other emotion?

315
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:57,500
It was just after I
had killed the Borg.

316
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,125
I looked down
at his body.

317
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,959
I felt something.

318
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:11,375
If you had to give
this feeling a name,

319
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,041
what would you call it?

320
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:22,250
I believe... it was...

321
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:26,667
pleasure.

322
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,542
Red alert.
All hands to battle stations.

323
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,625
Lay in a course.
Engage, warp nine.

324
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,417
We've received a distress call
from the New Berlin colony.

325
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,125
They're under attack.
What's our ETA?

326
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,291
At warp nine,
15 minutes, 30 seconds.

327
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,542
Contact the<i> Crazy Horse</i> 
and the<i> Agamemnon.</i>

328
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,250
Have them standing by
in case we need them--

329
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,250
Captain, incoming message
from the New Berlin colony.

330
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,917
They have...

331
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,792
canceled their
distress call.

332
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,750
Evidently, a Ferengi
trading ship

333
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,500
entered their system
and someone panicked.

334
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,458
Third time today.
Stand down red alert.

335
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,125
Reduce speed, return to
our patrol route.

336
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,667
Mr. Worf, acknowledge
the signal from New Berlin

337
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,709
and transmit<i> another</i> copy

338
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,917
of Starfleet's
ship recognition protocols,

339
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,041
and tell them to
read it this time.

340
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,291
Aye, sir.

341
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,667
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

342
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,875
<i>We have been on patrol</i>
<i>for 16 hours</i>

343
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,625
<i>and there are no reports</i>
<i>of further Borg activity.</i>

344
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,458
<i>But tensions continue</i>
<i>to run high</i>

345
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,792
<i>on the colonies and outposts</i>
<i>in this sector.</i>

346
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,917
Do I have a name?

347
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,625
I'm Beverly,
he's Geordi,

348
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,417
and you... you...

349
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:33,875
LA FORGE:
No, no, wait a minute.

350
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:37,208
That's it... Hugh.

351
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,458
We are Hugh.

352
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,750
(<i> door chimes</i> )

353
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,542
PICARD:
Come.

354
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,959

like to see this.

00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,166
the Borg used to escape.

357
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:52,041
An artificially created
energy conduit?

358
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,500
That could be anything.

359
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,208
We don't have enough
information at this point--

360
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,041
I don't want excuses,
Number One, I want answers!

361
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,875
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:09,583
He was here in
this room, Will.

363
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,875
I could have rid the Federation
of a mortal threat,

364
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,625
and I let him go.

365
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:17,500
Sending Hugh back to the Borg
was a very risky...

366
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,792
a very<i> dangerous</i> choice.

367
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,709
But it was the
moral thing to do.

368
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:26,542
Well, it may turn out
that the moral thing to do

369
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:29,208
was not the<i> right</i>
thing to do.

370
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,959
Stop it.

371
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,917
Stop. Stop.

372
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:56,333
Stop. Stop.

373
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,959
Stop.

374
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,583
Data, am I interrupting
something?

375
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,542
Yes.
But it is all right.

376
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:12,250
Do you need me?

377
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,250
Uh, I... wanted to see if you
were ready to return to duty.

378
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,625
I need some help
with an analysis

379
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,333
on the ship the Borg
were using.

380
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:22,125
I believe I am able
to resume my duties.

381
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,250
Data, exactly what is it
that you're doing here?

382
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,166
I am attempting to
recreate the experience

383
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,208
which caused my initial
outburst of anger.

384
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,583
Any luck?

385
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,959
None so far.

386
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,875
I have almost completed
this experiment.

387
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,542
May I finish before we
return to Engineering?

388
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah, sure.

389
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,417
Computer,
reset Borg simulation

390
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,333
to time index 2.1.

391
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,667
Increase Borg strength by 20%.

392
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,375
Run program.

393
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,375
Stop it.

394
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,542
Stop.

395
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:03,375
Stop. Stop.

396
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,000
Stop.

397
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,333
Computer,
reset simulation

398
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,083
to time index 2.1.

399
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,417
Increase Borg strength
by 30%.

400
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,000
COMPUTER:
Unable to comply.

401
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,083
A 30% increase would
exceed safety limits.

402
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,583
Geordi, the computer requires

403
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,792
a voice authorization
of two senior officers

404
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,709
in order to disable
the safety routine.

405
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,041
Will you help me?

406
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,917
Data, wait a minute.

407
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,208
That thing could
kill you.

408
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,125
During the original incident,

409
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,166
the Borg presented a genuine
danger to my life.

410
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,959
Since the holodeck
safety routine is in place,

411
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:45,166
I know my life
is not in danger.

412
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,959
Since I am trying to
duplicate the conditions

413
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,542
of the original incident
as closely as possible,

414
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:52,750
I must also attempt to duplicate
my jeopardy as well.

415
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,125
Data, we're talking
about an experiment here.

416
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,875
You can't put your life
on the line

417
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,542
just to prove some theory.

418
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,250
This experiment
may hold the key

419
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,583
to something I have sought
all my life.

420
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

421
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,959
This is crazy.

422
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,208
There's gotta be
another way.

423
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,083
Can't you think
of some other way

424
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,417
to make yourself angry?

425
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:19,166
I have tried
other stimuli,

426
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,583
but they have been
unsuccessful.

427
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:25,542
I understand your objections,
but it is my life,

428
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:27,750
and I have a right to
risk it, if I choose.

429
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,083
Yeah, and I'm your friend
and I'm not gonna just

430
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,625
stand around
and let you do this.

431
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,500
RIKER: Red alert. All hands,
battle stations.

432
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,291
Confirmed.

433
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,208
The MS 1 colony
is under attack.

434
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,667
Doesn't it seem
strange to you

435
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,166
that there have been
two Borg attacks,

436
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,792
and the<i> Enterprise</i>
has been the nearest ship

437
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,083
in both instances?

438
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:56,458
Captain, we are
nearing the MS system.

439
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,291
I have located
the Borg ship.

440
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,917
It is heading away
from the colony.

441
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:01,917
Take us out of warp
near that ship.

442
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:04,083
Stand by to lock
phasers on target.

443
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,333
WORF:
Within visual range.

444
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,750
On screen.

445
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,834
PICARD:
Lay in an intercept course.

446
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:15,041
Full impulse.
Lock phasers.

447
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,542
We are closing, sir.

448
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:21,458
Within phaser range
in 30 seconds.

449
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,959
Sensors are detecting
a subspace distortion

450
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:26,250
forming directly ahead
of the Borg ship.

451
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,125
Well, they're not gonna
get away with it this time.

452
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,542
Picard to Engineering.
Transfer auxiliary

453
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,709
and emergency power
to the impulse engines.

454
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,000
LA FORGE:
Acknowledged.

455
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,125
Impulse engines
are now at 125%.

456
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,125
Within phaser range
in ten seconds.

457
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,834
We appear to be caught in
some kind of energy matrix.

458
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,417
All engines back full.

459
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:49,834
Shields failing.

460
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:52,500
We are being
pulled inside.

461
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,375
WORF: Inertial
dampers failing.

462
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,000
Main power
is off-line.

463
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,333
I am switching
to backups.

464
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,500
Picard to Engineering.

465
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,166
Can we transfer
auxiliary power

466
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,500
to the warp nacelles?

467
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,458
Try to break us out
by using the...

468
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,250
We have returned
to normal space.

469
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,417
Navigational systems
are still off-line.

470
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,291
I will attempt to
make a celestial fix

471
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:21,959
using secondary systems.

472
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:24,667
Captain, the Borg ship
is directly ahead.

473
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:27,125
It is coming about.

474
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,291
On screen.

475
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,792
Shields down to 16%.

476
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,333
MAN:
Get down!

477
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:57,041
RIKER:
Franklin's dead, sir.

478
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,542
Is everyone else
all right?

479
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,625
Aye, sir.

480
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:05,750
Security reports there are
no other intruders aboard.

481
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,458
Captain...
the Borg ship is gone.

482
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,291
Sensor logs
indicate they entered

483
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,750
the distortion field
30 seconds ago.

484
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,834
They beamed on board
as a diversion

485
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:20,250
to give their ship
time to escape.

486
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,458
This is another change
in the Borg behavior.

487
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:27,250
They left their dead
instead of vaporizing them.

488
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,500
DATA:
Captain.

489
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,125
This one is still alive.

490
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,625
I've stabilized
his condition.

491
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:46,792
He's still pretty weak, but he
should make a full recovery.

492
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:48,750
Can you awaken him?

493
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,625
Yes, but it's very risky.

494
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,083
His heart rate and
blood pressure are up--

495
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,208
Do it.

496
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:58,000
All right.

497
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,917
Lower the force-field.

498
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:29,542
What is your designation?

499
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:32,625
I do not have
a designation.

500
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,709
My name is Crosis.

501
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:42,041
Crosis?
How did you get that name?

502
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,875
It was given to me by the one.

503
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,333
Who is that?

504
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,375
The one who will
destroy you.

505
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:52,542
But you are Borg.

506
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:55,583
Your goal is not to destroy

507
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:58,125
but to assimilate us
into your collective.

508
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:02,625
We do not assimilate inferior
biological organisms.

509
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,458
We destroy them.

510
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:09,208
PICARD: Tell me more
about this "one."

511
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:12,458
Does he... have a name?

512
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,083
Is he called Hugh?

513
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,542
Klingon--

514
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:21,750
shatter cranial exoskeleton
at the tricipital lobe.

515
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,291
Death is immediate.

516
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:27,834
Why must this "one" destroy
biological organisms?

517
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:32,291
Human-- sever spinal cord
at third vertebrae.

518
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:33,667
Death is immediate.

519
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:36,458
I am Locutus of Borg.

520
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:39,208
You will respond
to my questions.

521
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,583
This is going nowhere.

522
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:51,458
Doctor, I want you to do
an autopsy on the other one.

523
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:52,709
Compare the differences

524
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:54,667
with what we learned
of Hugh's anatomy.

525
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:58,041
See if there have been
any recent modifications

526
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,458
which might explain
these behavioral differences.

527
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:03,542
Data, run a biospectral
analysis on this Borg.

528
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:07,291
See if he is trying to send a
subspace signal to the others.

529
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,792
Aye, sir.

530
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:18,208
You are not
like the others.

531
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,834
You do not have to
be destroyed.

532
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:22,083
You can be assimilated.

533
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:24,417
I do not wish
to be assimilated.

534
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:27,542
Resistance... is futile.

535
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,083
You will not resist

536
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,125
what you've wanted
all your life.

537
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:37,375
I was like you once--
without feeling.

538
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,750
But the one helped me.

539
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,583
He can help you, too.
He can help you find emotion.

540
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,625
Have you ever felt a
real emotion, Data?

541
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:52,083
Yes.

542
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:57,458
On Ohniaka III, I was...
forced to kill a Borg.

543
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,333
I got angry.

544
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,875
How did it
feel to get angry?

545
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,458
Did it give you pleasure?

546
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,792
It would be unethical

547
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:12,125
to take pleasure in
another being's death.

548
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:14,583
You didn't answer
my question.

549
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,875
Did it feel
good to kill?

550
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,792
Yes.

551
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:26,291
If it is unethical
to take pleasure

552
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,834
from another being's death,

553
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:31,750
you must be a very
unethical person.

554
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,375
No.

555
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,875
That is not correct.

556
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:42,834
My creator, Dr. Soong,
gave me a program

557
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:47,125
which defines
my sense of right and wrong.

558
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:50,959
In essence, I have
a conscience.

559
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,125
It didn't seem to be functioning
on Ohniaka III

560
00:30:56,125 --> 00:31:00,333
when you felt pleasure
in killing that Borg.

561
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,458
Step away from
the force-field.

562
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:07,291
Your proximity is interfering
with my scan.

563
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,959
You enjoyed it--

564
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:13,375
that surge of emotion
inside you--

565
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,917
as you watched the life
drain from your victim.

566
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:21,583
It was unlike anything
you've ever felt before.

567
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:26,291
It was a very...
potent experience.

568
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:28,959
You'd like to feel
that way again.

569
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,667
Yes.

570
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:37,291
You'd do anything to
feel that way again...

571
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:39,208
even if it meant
killing someone.

572
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,959
No.

573
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:46,333
That would not be ethical.

574
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,375
You don't sound
very sure of yourself.

575
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:51,041
Is your ethical
program functioning?

576
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,875
Data...

577
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,458
do you have a friend?

578
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,500
Yes.

579
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,125
His name is Geordi.

580
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:11,250
If it meant that you
could feel emotions again,

581
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,792
the way you did
on Ohniaka III,

582
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:17,417
would you kill
your friend?

583
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:20,166
Would you kill Geordi?

584
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:27,625
Yes... I would.

585
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:36,875
Our current theory is
that the Borg have established

586
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,625
several transwarp conduits
through subspace.

587
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,208
The ship, when
entering the conduit,

588
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:42,458
is immediately accelerated

589
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,041
to an extremely high warp
velocity.

590
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,625
It's like falling
into a fast-moving river

591
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,375
and being swept away
by the current.

592
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:50,875
How fast would a ship travel
through one of these conduits?

593
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:52,834
Oh, we don't know.

594
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:54,375
Normal subspace limitations

595
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,250
don't apply to
transwarp variables.

596
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,875
But I'd say, based on
the distance we covered

597
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,417
during our trip
through the conduit,

598
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:03,417
the speed would have to be
at least 20 times faster

599
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,375
than our maximum warp.

600
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,125
How do they open
the conduits?

601
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:10,834
The Borg ship emitted some kind
of high-energy tachyon pulse

602
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:13,250
just before we saw
the subspace distortion.

603
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,625
Seems as though the conduits

604
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,917
are keyed to respond
to tachyon transmissions

605
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:18,375
of a specific frequency.

606
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,208
Is there any way for
us to duplicate--

607
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:23,125
Captain, a shuttlecraft
has left Bay Two.

608
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,333
Who authorized
the launch?

609
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,959
There was no
authorization.

610
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:28,166
Picard to Shuttlecraft.
Identify yourself

611
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:31,834
and return to
the ship immediately.

612
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,417
Mr. Worf...

613
00:33:33,417 --> 00:33:35,500
lock on with a tractor beam
and return it to the ship.

614
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,041
Aye, sir.

615
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:41,583
The tractor beam
has been disabled.

616
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:43,458
The command override
is not functioning.

617
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:46,834
Captain, I'm picking up
a tachyon surge.

618
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:48,333
Looks like whoever's
in the shuttle

619
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,291
is trying to trigger
the transwarp conduit.

620
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:54,583
Do we know who's on board?

621
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:58,959
It is the Borg prisoner...

622
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,792
and Commander Data.

623
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:16,041
Mr. La Forge, can we follow
them into the conduit?

624
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,542
We've got a pretty good reading
of the tachyon pulse they sent.

625
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:20,083
We might be able
to duplicate it.

626
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:23,917
The question is,
is Data a prisoner,

627
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:25,542
or did he go willingly?

628
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:27,959
The command overrides used
to disable the tractor beam

629
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,291
<i>were</i> Commander Data's.

630
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:30,667
The Borg could have
downloaded the codes

631
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:33,000
from Data's
positronic net.

632
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,041
Perhaps Data's recent
flash of emotion

633
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,375
has something
to do with this.

634
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,125
It could have affected
him more profoundly

635
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:40,625
than we realize.

636
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,125
Either way,
we have to find him.

637
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,333
I've set up a temporary
tachyon matrix

638
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,500
in the main deflector.

639
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,041
I think I can
use it to simulate

640
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,458
the pulse sent by the shuttle.

641
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,959
Mr. Worf, red alert.

642
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:51,917
All hands--
battle stations.

643
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:56,542
Bring us to the last known
coordinates of the shuttlecraft.

644
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:59,083
Shields up, weapons ready.

645
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,375
Mr. La Forge?

646
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,959
Energizing the matrix.

647
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:06,291
Emitting tachyons in
the lower bandwidth.

648
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:11,417
Sensors show no unusual
subspace activity.

649
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:15,291
All right, switching to
the secondary bandwidth.

650
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,125
Nothing.

651
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:22,208
Maybe... if I try
alternating the frequencies.

652
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:28,250
Captain, there is an
energy fluctuation

653
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,750
directly ahead of us.

654
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,458
It is the subspace distortion.

655
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:33,542
Take us in, Ensign,
one-half impulse.

656
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,625
Power levels
are down to 67%.

657
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:43,625
Compensating with
auxiliary power.

658
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,750
Report.

659
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,959
Navigational sensors show
that we've traveled...

660
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:55,333
65 light years from
our previous position.

661
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,208
(<i> sighs</i> )

662
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,834
Can you locate the shuttle?

663
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:07,709
No, sir.
There is no indication

664
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:11,458
of the shuttle within
range of our sensors.

665
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:14,917
Maybe we can find an energy
signature from their engines.

666
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:16,583
Captain.
Yes, Mr. La Forge?

667
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:18,542
I've scanned three
different star systems

668
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,417
within sensor range.

669
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:22,917
There is evidence of at least
two advanced civilizations,

670
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,875
but I'm reading
no life signs.

671
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:27,834
But there are indications that
plasma weapons have been fired

672
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:29,959
in those systems recently.

673
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:32,500
The Borg have been busy.

674
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,917
I think we've found the
shuttle's energy signature.

675
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,208
They were heading 247, mark 059.

676
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:46,458
Lay in that course, Ensign,
and engage at full impulse.

677
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:48,375
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

678
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,834
We've traced the
shuttle's energy signature

679
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:02,000
to this point on the surface,
but there's too much

680
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,458
interference to
scan the location.

681
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,417
Are they intentionally
jamming our sensors?

682
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:08,125
It looks more like a
natural phenomenon.

683
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,583
There's an unusually
high amount of EM interference

684
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,041
in the planet's magnetosphere.

685
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,792
Can we transport
through the interference?

686
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:16,291
We could, but there could be
50 Borg down there

687
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,333
waiting for us,
and we'd never even know it.

688
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:22,750
I think we have
to take the risk.

689
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:26,417
Agreed.

690
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:27,917
Take a well-armed away team

691
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,959
and transport down
to those coordinates.

692
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:31,959
Have the transporter chief keep
a permanent lock

693
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,333
on your signal,
so we can get you

694
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,709
out of there at the first
sign of trouble.

695
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:37,000
Aye, sir.
Mr. Worf, you're with me.

696
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:48,709
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

697
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:50,959
We're on the surface.

698
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:53,792
There's no sign
of any Borg...

699
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,333
or Data.

700
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:59,083
The shuttle appears
to be abandoned.

701
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:04,709
The EM interference is
limiting the tricorder range.

702
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:08,458
It is useless
beyond 100 meters.

703
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,166
There are no structures
in the area.

704
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,959
They could have gone anywhere.

705
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,542
Can you determine
how long they've been gone

706
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,500
from the shuttlecraft?

707
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,542
The engine's been off
a little over three hours.

708
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:25,792
Stand by, Number One.

709
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,458
Assuming that they're
still together,

710
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:29,709
how far could they have
traveled in three hours?

711
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:31,458
Well, Data can move
pretty fast

712
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:33,792
even over rough terrain,
but based on what we know

713
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,875
about the Borg, I don't
think they should be able

714
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,750
to move any faster
than you or I.

715
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,875
They might have been able
to get 15 to 20 kilometers

716
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:42,166
away from the shuttle by now.

717
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,792
Picard to Riker.
Riker here.

718
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:46,917
I'm gonna start sending
down other away teams.

719
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:49,750
Set up a command post and
begin mapping a search plan.

720
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,333
RIKER: Understood.
Picard out.

721
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,583
I want to use the shuttlecraft
for low-level reconnaissance.

722
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,083
Have the designated pilots
assemble in main shuttlebay.

723
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,083
Aye, sir.
And all available personnel,

724
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,208
including you and me,
we'll begin to put together

725
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,625
four-man away teams.

726
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:07,458
I'll leave a skeleton crew
on board the ship.

727
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:11,291
Who'll be in command
of the<i> Enterprise?</i>

728
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,875
Any last orders?

729
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,375
If the Borg should attack,

730
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,959
don't wait for me
or anyone else

731
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,959
to return to the ship,
but take the<i> Enterprise</i>

732
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,792
to the transwarp conduit.

733
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:24,500
Return to Federation space.

734
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
Got it.

735
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,000
Good luck, Jean-Luc.

736
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,083
Good luck... Captain.

737
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:44,125
I've sent out 12 teams so far.

738
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,959
I've got your team
searching section Gamma 2-4.

739
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:50,375
Worf and I will take Theta 1-6
when the last team comes down.

740
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,583
Who's manning
the command post?

741
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:53,500
Wallace and Towles.

742
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,125
Ready?

743
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,542
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

744
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,458
Anything, Mr. La Forge?

745
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:36,041
Well... no.

746
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,500
Nothing, sir.

747
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,583
What if we modified
the phasers to send out

748
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,375
a luvetric pulse?

749
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,625
It might create a
resonance fluctuation

750
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,083
in Data's power cells.

751
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,000
Home in on that response
with the tricorders.

752
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,834
Yeah, I thought about that.

753
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:50,917
The only problem is that
the pulse would probably

754
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:53,625
have to be so powerful
that it would destroy

755
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:56,041
Data's positronic
net in the process.

756
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,625
Captain?

757
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,250
I think
I found something.

758
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:15,125
Come on.

759
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,417
I'm having a very
difficult time

760
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:33,583
scanning the interior.

761
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:36,625
Can you tell if it
was built by the Borg?

762
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:39,125
Mmm... I don't think so.

763
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:42,000
There are no Borg
energy signatures.

764
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,917
But there is a door or...
a hatch or something,

765
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:47,458
about 20 meters this way.

766
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:17,917
This seems to be some
kind of meeting place.

767
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:20,375
PICARD: Well, it certainly
hasn't been abandoned.

768
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,000
Something's wrong.

769
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,333
I can't get any kind
of energy signatures

770
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,709
from these light sources.

771
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,709
It's a dampening field.

772
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:34,583
This entire structure could
be shielded from our sensors.

773
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,250
Let's go.

774
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,500
BORG:
There they are!

775
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,375
(<i> Borg yelling</i> )

776
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,375
(<i> yelling intensifies</i> )

777
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:58,583
MAN:
Stop!

778
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,125
Data.

779
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:06,125
That's not Data.

780
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,583
What?

781
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:10,291
You should listen to her,
Captain.

782
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,792
She's way ahead of you.

783
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,875
Lore.

784
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:19,667
Right...

785
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,792
and I'm not alone.

786
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,291
The sons of Soong
have joined together.

787
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:31,750
And together...

788
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,500
we will destroy
the Federation.

789
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,417
(<i> excited shouting</i> )
