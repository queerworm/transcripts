00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,291
<i>Last time on</i> Star Trek:
The Next Generation...

00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,834
"You are hereby requested

00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,417
"to relinquish command

00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,917
"to captain Edward Jellico,
Commanding Officer

USS<i> Cairo,</i> as of this date."

6
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,375
I want this ship
ready for action

7
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:17,834
and I don't have time

8
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:22,250
to give Will Riker,
or anyone else a "chance."

9
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,000
And forgive me
for being blunt

10
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,375
but the<i> Enterprise</i> is mine now.

11
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,417
Our orders are to penetrate

12
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,834
the Celtris III
installation.

13
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,041
It's a trap! Come on!

14
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,875
Let's go.

15
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:53,041
The captain!

16
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,542
No. There are
five more of them

17
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,125
heading this way
from another tunnel.

18
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,959
You should prove
an interesting challenge.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,959
Possibly the most interesting
to come through that door

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,625
in many years.

21
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,417
What do you want?

22
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,250
Why, you, of course.

23
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,792
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

24
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,583
Your place
of birth?

25
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,667
(<i> detached monotone</i> ):
La Barre, France.

26
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:27,542
Mother's name?

27
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:30,208
Yvette Gessard.

28
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,333
He's ready.

29
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,917
Keep the serum
at that level.

30
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,959
What is your
current assignment?

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,417
Special operations
on Celtris III.

32
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:45,375
What is your mission
on Celtris III?

33
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:48,458
To seek and destroy
a metagenic weapon.

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,083
How many others
were part of this mission?

35
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,291
Two.

36
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,542
Name and rank?

37
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,417
Chief Medical Officer
Beverly Crusher.

38
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,000
Lieutenant Worf.

39
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:05,333
What are the Federation's
defense plans for Minos Korva?

40
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,834
I don't know.

41
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:13,125
Increase the level
slightly to .31.

42
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,041
Let's begin again,
shall we?

43
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,583
Name?

44
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,291
Picard, Jean-Luc.

45
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,125
Place of birth?

46
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,500
La Barre, France.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,125
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

48
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,250
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

49
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,834
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

50
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

51
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:15,458
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

52
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,750
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

53
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:19,875
JELLICO:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46360.8.</i>

54
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:21,250
<i>The negotiations</i>
<i>with the Cardassians</i>

55
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,709
<i>have made little progress.</i>

56
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,291
<i>I believe</i>
<i>a military confrontation</i>

57
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,333
<i>may be unavoidable.</i>

58
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,542
Gul Lemec, I assure you
that what the Federation wants

59
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,792
above all,
is the preservation of peace.

60
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:35,458
Then, how do you
explain the fact

61
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,250
that a Federation team
launched an unprovoked assault

62
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,583
on Cardassian territory
less than 14 hours ago?

63
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,750
I don't know
what you're talking about.

64
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,792
Then let me explain.

65
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,709
Captain Jean-Luc Picard,
Lieutenant Worf,

66
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,542
and Dr. Beverly Crusher
landed on Celtris III

67
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,709
attacked one of our outposts
in a brutal assault

68
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,417
and killed over
55 men, women

69
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,333
and children.

70
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,208
What evidence
do you have of that?

71
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,875
We have all the
evidence we need.

72
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:10,125
We have Captain Picard.

73
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,041
Is he alive?

74
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,417
The Cardassian Union

75
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,792
has yet to decide
how it will respond

76
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:25,792
to this latest provocation,
but rest assured...

77
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,542
we will respond.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,625
Is there any truth
in what he's saying?

79
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,333
Captain Picard
and the others

80
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,041
were sent
to investigate reports

81
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,834
of a metagenic weapon
on Celtris III.

82
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:50,834
It's possible that they
may have been captured,

83
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,417
but if they did escape

84
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,417
they'll head for
the Lyshan system.

85
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,792
The<i> Enterprise</i> is supposed to
meet them there in eight hours.

86
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:00,417
Will, I want you to take
a shuttlecraft

87
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,083
and head
for the rendezvous point.

88
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,500
The<i> Enterprise</i> 
will have to remain here

89
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:08,667
until the endgame
with Gul Lemec is played out.

90
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,125
Aye, sir.

91
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:23,875
Captain Picard.

92
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,166
I demand to see
a neutral representative

93
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,125
as required by
the Federation-Cardassian
peace treaty.

94
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,291
We have already sent a message
to Tohvun III--

95
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,750
the nearest
neutral planet.

96
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,041
They assure us

97
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,250
they will dispatch
someone immediately.

98
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,917
Will you allow me
to remove your restraints?

99
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,875
(<i> beeping, clicking</i> )

100
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,625
I understand that you are
a student of archaeology.

101
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,709
Did you know
that Cardassia boasts

102
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,000
some of the most ancient
and splendid ruins

103
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,500
in the entire galaxy?

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,375
I know that the burial vaults

105
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,583
of the first
Hebitian civilization

106
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,709
are said to be magnificent.

107
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,208
Apparently, when they
were first unearthed

108
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,792
200 years ago, they were.

109
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,875
The burial vaults contained
unimaginably beautiful

110
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,792
artifacts made of jevonite--

111
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:36,875
a rare, breathtaking stone--

112
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:39,542
but most
of those objects are gone.

113
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:43,375
What happened to them?

114
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:46,417
What happens
to impoverished societies--

115
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:51,500
the tombs were plundered,
priceless treasures stolen.

116
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,250
A few were preserved in museums

117
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,291
but even those
were eventually sold

118
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,291
in order to pay
for our war efforts.

119
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:02,291
That war cost you hundreds
of thousands of lives.

120
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,041
It depleted your food supplies

121
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:08,417
left your population
weakened and miserable

122
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,625
and yet you risk another war.

123
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:16,375
Let's not waste time arguing
about issues we cannot resolve.

124
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:19,917
Would you care to tour
the Hebitian burial vaults?

125
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,208
What I would like
is to be returned to my ship.

126
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:30,125
My dear Captain,
you are a criminal.

127
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,291
You've been apprehended

128
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,583
invading one of our
secret facilities.

129
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,709
The least that will happen
is for you to stand trial

130
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,625
and be punished.

131
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,750
But I'm offering you
the opportunity

132
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,875
for that experience to be...

133
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,375
civilized.

134
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,625
What is the price
of that opportunity?

135
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,750
Cooperation.

136
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:52,291
We need to know
the Federation's

137
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,208
defense strategy
for Minos Korva.

138
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,125
You've injected me with drugs.

139
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,792
Surely, you must realize

140
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,709
that I've already answered
truthfully

141
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,417
every question you've put to me.

142
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:09,375
Captain, we have gone to great
lengths to lure you here

143
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,959
because we know that,
in the event of an invasion

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,750
the<i> Enterprise</i> will be
the command ship for the sector

145
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:18,333
encompassing
Minos Korva.

146
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,041
Then, it seems you have

147
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,792
more knowledge of
the situation than I.

148
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,041
Wasted energy, Captain.

149
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,208
You might come to wish
you hadn't expended it

150
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,291
in such a futile effort.

151
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,166
Torture is expressly forbidden

152
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,125
under the terms
of the Seldonis IV Convention

153
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,333
governing the treatment
of prisoners of war!

154
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,166
Are you in good health?

155
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,125
Do you have any
physical ailments

156
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,792
I should know about?

157
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:15,542
Beautiful, isn't it?

158
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:19,291
The stone is jevonite,

159
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:24,041
and now you know why
it is so highly prized.

160
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,333
From this point on

161
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,625
you will enjoy
no privilege of rank

162
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:33,208
no privileges of person.

163
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:39,333
From now on, I will refer
to you only as "human."

164
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,458
You have no other identity.

165
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,750
(<i> beep</i> )

166
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,417
RIKER:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

167
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,125
<i>I have returned</i>

168
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,542
<i>in the Lyshan system</i>

169

<i>with Dr. Crusher</i>
<i>and Lieutenant Worf.</i>

170
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,542
<i>Captain Picard's fate</i>
<i>is still unknown.</i>

171
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,709
There was no chance

172
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,792
to go back
for the captain.

173
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,041
We barely made it back

174
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,542
to the Ferengi cargo ship
ourselves.

175
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,875
You were smart
not to try.

176
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:34,166
I don't feel so smart.

177
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,667
Get some rest, Doctor.

178
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,375
Will.

179
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,291
I want Geordi to
analyze the readings

180
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,625
from Beverly's tricorder.

181
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,041
Tell him to scrutinize
every detail

182
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,041
of those caverns
on Celtris III.

183
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,625
Aye, sir.

184
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:58,709
Request permission to begin
planning a rescue operation.

185
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,834
I know you were
close to him, Will,

186
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,917
but we don't even know
if he's still alive.

187
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,709
Under the circumstances

188
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,959
a rescue mission
would be foolhardy.

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,792
Shouldn't we assume
that he<i> is</i> alive

190
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,500
until it's been
proved otherwise?

191
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,834
We cannot just abandon him.

192
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,542
He's gone.

193
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:18,500
I'm sorry, Will, but you're
going to have to accept that.

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,709
I want those tricorder readings
analyzed by 1400 hours.

195
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,625
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:46,959
Good morning.
I trust you slept well.

197
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,333
(<i> panting</i> )

198
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,875
Thirsty?

199
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,375
I would imagine so.

200
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,250
Well...

201
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,291
it's time to move on.

202
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,291
I told you all that I know.

203
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,291
Yes, I'm sure you have.

204
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,583
How many lights
do you see there?

205
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,125
I see four lights.

206
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,583
No.

207
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,834
There are five.

208
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,792
Are you quite sure?

209
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,333
There are four lights.

210
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,917
Perhaps you're aware
of the incision in your chest.

211
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,875
While you were under
the influence of our drugs

212
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,500
you were implanted
with a small device.

213
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,750
It's a remarkable invention.

214
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,834
By entering commands
in this PADD

215
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,166
I can produce pain

216
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,333
in any part of your body--
at various levels

217
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,417
of severity.

218
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,000
Forgive me.

219
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,125
I don't enjoy this,
but I must demonstrate.

220
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,750
It will make everything clearer.

221
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,792
(<i> gasps in pain</i> )

222
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,625
Surprising, isn't it?

223
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,625
Most people feel at first they
can steel themselves against it,

224
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:49,750
but they're
completely unprepared

225
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:52,041
for the intensity of the pain.

226
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,458
That was the lowest
possible setting.

227
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,083
I know nothing
about Minos Korva.

228
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,500
But I've told you
that I believe you.

229
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:05,083
I didn't ask you
about Minos Korva.

230
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,208
I asked how many
lights you see.

231
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,750
There are four lights.

232
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:23,625
I don't understand
how you can be so mistaken.

233
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,417
(<i> intense groans</i> )

234
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,750
What is your
current assignment?

235
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,750
Special operations
on Celtris III.

236
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,500
Do you have anything to say?

237
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:42,458
Captain Picard was not
acting under my orders.

238
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,542
And if we wish to execute him?

239
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,125
Under the terms

240
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,125
of the Seldonis Convention,
Captain Picard...

241
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,166
The Seldonis Convention
applies to prisoners of war.

242
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,875
Which means you
would have to acknowledge

243
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,542
that he was captured
during a mission

244
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,291
authorized by the Federation.

245
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,125
Are you willing to make
such an admission?

246
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,375
No.

247
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:03,542
Then, he will be treated
as a terrorist.

248
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,208
It's not my concern.

249
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,917
There is, of course,
an alternative.

250
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,792
JELLICO:
I'm listening.

251
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:16,583
If the Federation agreed

252
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,583
to a complete and immediate
withdrawal from this sector

253
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,250
then we would be... disposed

254
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,291
to release Captain Picard

255
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:29,125
and forget about this incident.

256
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,250
I'll have to discuss this
with my superiors.

257
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,083
Of course.

258
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,166
You have seven hours.

259
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,000
What are you going to do?

260
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,458
Send a message
to Admiral Nechayev.

261
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,000
I recommend that she reject
Lemec's proposal

262
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,917
and deploy additional
starships along the border.

263
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,667
What about
Captain Picard?

264
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm not suggesting you
trade an entire star system

265
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,375
for one man's life,

266
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:00,667
but you've got
to acknowledge

267
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,041
that these were
Federation orders

268
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,250
and that he<i> is</i>
a prisoner of war.

269
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,291
No.

270
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,583
He will have
the protection

271
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,125
of the Seldonis Convention.

272
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,000
That would play right
into Gul Lemec's hand.

273
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,291
He's just waiting for some
sign of weakness on our part

274
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,667
before he starts
making more demands.

275
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,625
I can't believe you're
willing to sacrifice

276
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,375
Captain Picard's life
as a negotiation tactic.

277
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,959
Will, Captain,
we're all concerned about...

278
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,125
Are you questioning
my judgment, Commander?

279
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,667
As first officer,
it is my responsibility

280
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,458
to point out any actions
that may be mistakes

281
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
by a commanding officer, sir.

282
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:30,625
Then, maybe it's time

283
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,792
you found other
responsibilities.

284
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,750
You're relieved.

285
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,333
Don't...

286
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,667
make me confine you
to quarters as well.

287
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,291
Sir.

288
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,500
They went to a
lot of trouble

289
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,875
to lure a Federation
team to that planet.

290
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,166
Why?

291
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,917
It is possible
the Cardassians

292
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:09,917
were specifically interested
in capturing Captain Picard.

293
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,667
Why do you say that?

294
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,542
The metagenic weapon
they were supposedly developing

295
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:17,250
used a theta-band
subspace delivery system.

296
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,250
Captain Picard is one
of only three Starfleet captains

297
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,250
with extensive experience
in theta-band devices.

298
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,083
The other two
are no longer in Starfleet.

299
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,583
So they tailored a fake
weapon to lure Picard.

300
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,208
But why?

301
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,417
They must have known

302
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,583
we'd change all his access codes
and security protocols.

303
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,208
Maybe they were interested
in something that he did
in the past--

304
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,375
something that happened while he
was captain of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

305
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,875
Or something he was going to do
in the future.

306
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,625
In case of a Cardassian attack

307
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,000
the<i> Enterprise</i> will be assigned
as command ship for this sector.

308
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,083
If the Cardassians
got wind of that...

309
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,583
They might have assumed

310
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,709
that captain Picard would know
those defense plans.

311
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,959
If your theory is correct,
the Cardassians may be planning

312
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,625
an attack somewhere
in this sector.

313
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,458
The question is where.

314
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,917
Geordi, I want you

315
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,875
to conduct a discreet scan
of Gul Lemec's ship.

316
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,542
Look for anything unusual--

317
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:11,208
anything that might indicate
where they've been lately.

318
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,208
Aye, sir.

319
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,083
I want you to be very careful
with your wompat

320
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,667
from now on,
Jil Orra.

321
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,875
Now that she's separated
from her mother

322
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:27,959
she depends on you.

323
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,208
I will, Father.

324
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,792
Do humans have
mothers and fathers?

325
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:37,500
Yes...

326
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,083
but human mothers
and fathers

327
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,709
don't love their children
as we do.

328
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,959
They're not the same
as we are.

329
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,875
Will you read
to me tonight?

330
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,125
Yes, of course, I will.

331
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,250
I'll see you later.

332
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,917
(<i> squeaking</i> )

333
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,750
(<i> door closes</i> )

334
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,834
Your daughter is lovely.

335
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,667
Yes, I think so.

336
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:14,667
And unusually bright.

337
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:17,250
It's amazing,
isn't it--

338
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,458
the way they're able
to sneak into your heart?

339
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,583
I must admit
I was completely unprepared

340
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,000
for the power
she had over me...

341
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,959
from the moment she was born.

342
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,917
I am surprised that...
you let her come in here.

343
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:36,166
Why?

344
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:43,500
To expose a child to... this--

345
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,125
to someone
who is suffering.

346
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,417
To see that

347
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:52,417
it is you
that inflict that suffering.

348
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,625
From the time,
Jil Orra could crawl

349
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,917
she's been taught about
the enemies of the Cardassians

350
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,083
and that enemies
deserve their fates.

351
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:03,792
When children learn
to devalue others

352
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:08,709
they can devalue anyone,
including their parents.

353
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:16,500
What a blind,
narrow view you have.

354
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:23,458
What an arrogant man you are.

355
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,542
What do you know
of Cardassian history?

356
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:30,875
I know that once you
were a peaceful people

357
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:33,125
with a rich spiritual life.

358
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,500
And what did peace
and spirituality get us?

359
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:37,166
People starved
by the millions.

360
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,583
Bodies went unburied.
Disease was rampant.

361
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,875
The suffering
was unimaginable.

362
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:43,667
Since the military
took over

363
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:46,792
hundreds of thousands
more have died.

364
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:49,417
But we are feeding the people.

365
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,417
We acquired territory
during the wars.

366
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,625
We developed new resources.

367
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:00,375
We initiated
a rebuilding program.

368
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:03,375
We have mandated
agricultural programs.

369
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:09,208
<i>That...</i> is what the military
has done for Cardassia.

370
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,166
And because of that

371
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,834
my daughter will never
worry about going hungry.

372
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,250
Her belly may be full

373
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,208
but her spirit will be empty.

374
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,625
Shall we begin again?

375
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,250
How many lights
are there?

376
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,333
What lights?

377
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,583
(<i> agonized groaning</i> )

378
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,959
LA FORGE:
It looks like they had

379
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,542
some minor hull degradation
along their warp nacelles.

380
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,166
The distribution pattern

381
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:18,375
indicates a recent exposure
to a molecular dispersion field.

382
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:20,583
Where could they have run
into a dispersion field?

383
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:23,375
The McAllister C-5 Nebula
is just across the border.

384
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:25,542
It's approximately
seven light years
from Federation space.

385
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,625
Could there be
Cardassian ships

386
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,166
inside the McAllister Nebula?

387
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,667
Well, it's possible,
but they wouldn't be able

388
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:31,875
to stay in there
for very long.

389
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,542
The particle flux
from the nebula

390
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,041
would begin to break
down a ship's hull
just after 72 hours.

391
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,750
Is there a Federation system
near the McAllister Nebula

392
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:42,208
that might interest
the Cardassians?

393
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,375
Minos Korva is just 11 light
years from the nebula

394
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:49,875
and the Cardassians tried
to annex it during the war.

395
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,959
Data, I want to be
at Minos Korva in one hour.

396
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,458
Aye, sir.

397
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,166
Set course 350 mark 215
and engage at warp 8.5.

398
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:15,041
(<i> mumbling</i> ):
♪<i> Sur le pont... d'avignon...</i>
<i>l'on y... l'on y danse...</i> ♪

399
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,667
Wake up.

400
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,792
Where were you?

401
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:27,542
At home.

402
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:34,959
Sunday dinner.

403
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,792
We would all
sing afterwards.

404
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:41,834
What a charming picture.

405
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:45,208
The Picard family...

406
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,375
voices raised in song.

407
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,208
Is that what's keeping you
from breaking?

408
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,041
Memories of home
and hearth?

409
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,750
Images of happier times?

410
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,709
I must
congratulate you.

411
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,625
You're remarkably
strong-willed.

412
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:00,375
I see no point
in holding you further.

413
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,625
You may go.

414
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,000
Someone will give you
clean clothing

415
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,375
before we return you
to your ship.

416
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:53,667
We will get what we need
from the human female.

417
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,750
What female are
you referring to?

418
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,208
The human who was part

419
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,917
of your abortive
assault team, of course--

420
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,625
Dr. Beverly Crusher.

421
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,041
What have you
done to her?

422
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,583
Not a thing.

423
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,959
She's quite safe.

424
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,291
I wanted to finish
my interviews with you

425
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,875
before I interrogated her.

426
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:26,959
I had hoped
it might not be necessary.

427
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,667
Lieutenant Worf?

428
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:30,917
He left us few options.

429
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,375
We had to kill him.

430
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:35,375
I'm more optimistic
about getting what we need

431
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:36,542
from the woman.

432
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:43,625
Dr. Crusher has no knowledge
of any Starfleet operations.

433
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,333
She's a medical officer.

434
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,458
You might be right, I'll have
to determine that for myself.

435
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,875
Are you choosing
to stay with me?

436
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,333
Excellent.

437
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:13,792
I can't tell you
how pleased that makes me.

438
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,834
Starfleet now believes
the Cardassians

439
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,959
are preparing to
invade Minos Korva.

440
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm convinced that
their invasion fleet

441
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,458
is hiding in
the McAllister Nebula.

442
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,166
I intend to hit it
before they leave it.

443
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:33,583
Captain,
what if you're wrong?

444
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,375
What if the Cardassians
are in that nebula

445
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,333
to conduct
scientific research?

446
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:40,166
You'd have to have
some pretty good evidence
to convince me of that.

447
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:43,333
You're still gambling
hundreds of lives.

448
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,000
This discussion is moot.

449
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,709
The plan has been approved
and we are going ahead.

450
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,458
Mr. Data,
by your calculations,

451
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,667
how long could the Cardassian
ships stay in the nebula?

452
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:55,542
In 17 hours,
their hull degradation

453
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:57,166
will reach dangerous levels.

454
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,917
They will have to
leave before that.

455
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,542
All right.

456
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:04,667
Worf, prepare a series
of 500 antimatter mines

457
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:07,458
with magnetic
targeting capabilities.

458
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,917
WORF: Aye, sir.

459
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,041
Geordi, we're going
to need a shuttle

460
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,667
specially outfitted to operate
in the nebula by 1400 hours.

461
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:17,917
Beverly, you'll need to...

462
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,959
Have Sick Bay ready
for the casualties
you're about to send me.

463
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,959
That's right.

464
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,458
Dismissed.

465
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,375
Ah, you're awake.

466
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:49,375
Have something to eat.

467
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,542
I insist.

468
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,875
Boiled taspar egg.

469
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:00,291
It's a delicacy
I'm happy to share with you.

470
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:28,375
(<i> chuckling</i> )
Wonderful.

471
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,959
Wonderful.
I like you, human.

472
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,208
Most people become ill

473
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,583
at the sight of
live taspar.

474
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,875
I remember the first time

475
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:42,792
I ate a live taspar.

476
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:45,208
I was six years old

477
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,083
and living on the streets
of Lakat.

478
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:51,291
There was a band of children--
four, five, six years old

479
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:54,333
some even smaller--

480
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,208
desperately
trying to survive.

481
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,083
We were thin,
scrawny little animals,

482
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,542
constantly hungry,
always cold.

483
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,500
We slept together
in doorways

484
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:07,500
like packs of wild
<i>gettles</i> for warmth.

485
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:09,583
Once, I found a nest.

486
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:12,041
Taspars had mated
and built a nest

487
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,500
in the eaves of
a burnt-out building

488
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:16,291
and I found
three eggs in it.

489
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,458
It was like
finding treasure.

490
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,583
I cracked one open
on the spot and ate it,

491
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,792
very much
as you just did.

492
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,709
I planned to save
the other two.

493
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,875
They would keep me alive
for another week.

494
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,375
Of course, an older boy
saw them and wanted them...

495
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,625
and he got them.

496
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,208
But he had to
break my arm to do it.

497
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,333
(<i> weakly</i> )
Must be rewarding to you to...

498
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:48,792
to repay others for
all those years of misery.

499
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,250
What do you mean?

500
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:54,875
Torture has never been
a reliable means

501
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:58,041
of extracting information.

502
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:02,792
It is ultimately self-defeating
as a means of control.

503
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:05,458
One wonders that
it's still practiced.

504
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,166
I fail to see where this
analysis is leading.

505
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:11,125
Whenever I...

506
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:13,625
look at you now,

507
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:17,583
I won't see a powerful
Cardassian warrior.

508
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,709
I will see
a six-year-old boy

509
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,875
who is powerless
to protect himself.

510
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:25,917
Be quiet!

511
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:28,792
In spite of all
you have done to me,

512
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:31,041
I find you a pitiable man.

513
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,875
Picard, stop it

514
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:35,959
or I will turn this on

515
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,458
and leave you in agony
all night.

516
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,166
You called me "Picard."

517
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:44,792
What are the Federation's
defense plans for Minos Korva?

518
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:47,250
There are four lights.

(<i> gasping painfully</i> )

520
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,125
There are<i> five</i> lights.

521
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:53,208
How many do you see now?

522
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,667
You are six years old,

523
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:59,542
weak and helpless.

524
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:02,959
You cannot hurt me!

525
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,667

We're almost done, sir.

531
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,417
I've shielded
the engine nacelles

532
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,166
and the transporter system,
so they won't be affected

00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,041
You're a pilot yourself,
aren't you, Geordi?

537
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,166
Yes, sir.

538
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:47,000
Began my career
as a shuttle pilot

539
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,667
on the Jovian run.

540
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:50,959
From Jupiter to
Saturn and back--

541
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,709
once a day,
every day.

542
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,083
Is that right?

543
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:57,041
I was on that run myself
for a while.

544
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,750
Then, you must have
done Titan's turn.

545
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,125
Oh, yeah.

546
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:05,250
You set a course
directly for Titan,

547
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,917
hold it till you're just
brushing the atmosphere

548
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,667
throw the helm hard over

549
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:11,625
and whip around the moon
at point seven "C."

550
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,834
And pray like hell
nobody saw you.

551
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:17,917
You know, this trip into the
nebula is going to need someone

552
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:20,417
who can do Titan's turn
in their sleep.

553
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,000
These mines need to be laid

554
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,500
within two kilometers
of the Cardassian ships,

555
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:26,333
but the particle flux
from the nebula

556
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:29,875
will blind every sensor, except
for this proximity detector.

557
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:32,875
You're going to need one heck
of a pilot to pull that off.

558
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:35,208
Is that you?

559
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,667
I could do it,
but, truthfully,

560
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:40,500
the man you want
is Commander Riker.

561
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:43,875
He's the best there is.

562
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:00,000
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come in.

563
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,041
Am I disturbing you?

564
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,709
Not at all.

565
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,417
Musician.

566
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,250
Yes.

567
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,959
Classical?
Contemporary?

568
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,709
Jazz.

569
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,834
Ah.

570
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:24,917
Is there something I can
do for you, Captain?

571
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,750
Are you aware of
our plans to attack

572
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:32,875
the Cardassian
invasion fleet?

573
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:34,709
Yes, sir.

574
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,333
I understand you've been talking
to every shuttle pilot on board.

575
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,333
Let's drop the
ranks for a moment.

576
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:43,792
I don't like you.

577
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:45,959
I think you're
insubordinate,

578
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,583
arrogant, willful

579
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,625
and I don't think
you're a particularly

580
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:52,000
good first officer,

581
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:55,709
but you are also
the best pilot on the ship.

582
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,458
Well...

583
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,959
now that the ranks
are dropped, Captain,

584
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,583
I don't like you either.

585
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:04,875
You<i> are</i> arrogant
and closed-minded.

586
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:07,834
You need to control
everything and everyone.

587
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,166
You don't provide
an atmosphere of trust

588
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,667
and you don't inspire
these people to go out of
their way for you.

589
00:35:12,709 --> 00:35:15,458
You've got everybody
wound up so tight

590
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,959
there's no joy
in anything.

591
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,291
I don't think you're
a particularly good captain.

592
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,542
I won't...

593
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,834
order you to fly this mission.

594
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,959
Then ask me.

595
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Will you pilot
the shuttle, Commander?

596
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,959
Yes.

597
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,959
You're welcome.

598
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:53,000
We've lost
primary navigation.

599
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,500
Switching
to secondary systems.

600
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:56,709
Inertial dampers
compensating.

601
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,667
Sensors inoperative.

602
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:00,709
Right on schedule.

603
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,500
LA FORGE:
Proximity detector is working.

604
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:05,125
We should be able
to read their ships

605
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,417
at a distance
of 500 meters.

606
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,959
Don't make this too easy.

607
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,375
(<i> chuckles</i> )

608
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:13,333
(<i> beeping</i> )

609
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:16,875
Hang on.

610
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,375
Do I want to know
how close that was?

611
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:23,959
No.

612
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,041
Get ready to deploy
the mines.

613
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,333
Captain, the shuttle
is emerging from the nebula.

614
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:38,000
<i>Enterprise</i> to shuttle.

615
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,417
Were you successful,
Commander?

616
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,667
RIKER: Aye, sir,
the mines are laid.

617
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:45,500
Very well.
Red alert.

618
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:48,750
Stand by to detonate
the mines on my command.

619
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,875
Standing by.

620
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,750
Open a channel
to the<i> Reklar.</i>

621
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:56,583
This is Cardassian territory,
Captain.

622
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:59,083
Your presence here is another
deliberate provocation...

623
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:01,375
I'm not going to argue
with you, Gul Lemec.

624
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:03,333
Every one of your ships
has a mine on its belly,

625
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:06,917
my finger's on the button and
you're in a very bad position.

626
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,792
You can't intimidate us.

627
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:12,333
Mr. Worf,
set off alpha-four-two.

628
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:13,667
Aye, sir.

629
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,625
JELLICO:
That was just a baby...

630
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,917
the big boys are
sitting on your hull

631
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,792
just waiting for me
to say the word.

632
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,875
What are your terms?

633
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:25,625
Your ships will leave
the nebula one by one.

634
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,792
Each ship will eject
its primary phaser coil

635
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:31,750
before setting course
for the nearest Cardassian base.

636
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,417
But that will leave us
defenseless.

637
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:36,458
Mr. Worf,
prepare to detonate...

638
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,709
I will agree to your terms.

639
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,834
Excellent.

640
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,417
Oh, and one more thing.

641
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,667
I understand you're holding
a Starfleet officer

642
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:48,917
named Jean-Luc Picard.

643
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:53,291
I expect him returned...
immediately.

644
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:28,917
That won't help.
I have many more.

645
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:34,875
Still, it felt good.

646
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:38,583
Enjoy your good feelings
while you can.

647
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:42,125
There may not be
many more of them.

648
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,667
I've just received word.

649
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:46,625
There's been a battle.

650
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:50,208
The<i> Enterprise</i> 
is burning in space.

651
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,667
The invasion of Minos Korva
has been successful.

652
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,792
I don't believe you.

653
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:59,041
There's no need for any further
information from you.

654
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,041
Our troops were successful

655
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,291
in spite of your refusal
to help me.

656
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,583
You might have saved yourself
a great deal of torment

657
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,250
by yielding
at the beginning.

658
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,834
I want... to see a...

659
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:13,250
neutral representative.

660
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,542
There is no such person.

661
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:20,083
The word will be that
you perished with your crew.

662
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:23,583
No one will ever know
that you are here with us

663
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:27,917
as you will be
for a long, long time.

664
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,166
You do, however,
have a choice.

665
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:42,750
You can live out your life
in misery, held here,

666
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:45,291
subject to my whims...

667
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,959
or you can live in comfort

668
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,458
with good food
and warm clothing...

669
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,458
women as you
desire them...

670
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,458
allowed to pursue your studies
of philosophy and history.

671
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,792
I would enjoy
debating with you.

672
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:58,834
You have a keen mind.

673
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,959
It's up to you.

674
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,166
A life of ease, of reflection,
and intellectual challenge...

675
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,208
or this.

676
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:15,500
What must I do?

677
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:17,792
Nothing, really.

678
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:24,083
Tell me...
how many lights you see.

679
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,083
How many?

680
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,542
How many lights?

681
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,542
This is your last chance.

682
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:46,375
The guards are coming.
Don't be a stubborn fool.

683
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:49,417
How many?

684
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:51,917
You told me
he would be ready to go.

685
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:55,709
We had some
unfinished business.

686
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,583
Get him cleaned up.

687
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,291
A ship is waiting to take him
back to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

688
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:06,625
Captain Picard,

689
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:10,375
if you'll go with the guards,
they'll take care of you.

690
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:28,250
There... are...
four lights!

691
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:54,959
Captain on the Bridge.

692
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,250
Welcome home,
Jean-Luc.

693
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,667
Thank you.

694
00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:04,208
Just the way you left it.

695
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,375
Maybe a little better.

696
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:08,959
Computer, transfer
all command codes

697
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,959
to Captain
Jean-Luc Picard.

698
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,291
Voice authorization:
Jellico-alpha-three-one.

699
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,917
COMPUTER:
Transfer complete.

700
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:17,709
USS<i> Enterprise</i> 
now under command

701
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,542
of Captain
Jean-Luc Picard.

702
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:23,667
I relieve you, sir.
I stand relieved.

703
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,875
It's been an honor
serving with you.

704
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,250
You have the Bridge,
Number One.

705
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,375
Aye, sir.

706
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,583
I, uh...

707
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,875
I don't know
where to begin.

708
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:59,041
It was, uh...

709
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:06,875
I read your report.

710
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,041
What I didn't put
in the report

711
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:15,709
was that, at the end,

712
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:19,709
he gave me a choice
between a life of comfort...

713
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,083
or more torture.

714
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,834
All I had to do

715
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:29,333
was to say that
I could see five lights

716
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:32,583
when, in fact,
there were only four.

717
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,792
You didn't say it.

718
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:38,542
No. No...

719
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,375
but I was going to.

720
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,000
I would have told
him anything.

721
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:45,250
Anything at all.

722
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,375
But more than that...

723
00:43:51,709 --> 00:43:55,166
I believed that
I could see...

724
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:58,959
five lights.
