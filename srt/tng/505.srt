00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:05,000
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45156.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,458
<i>Our mission to Mudor Five</i>
<i>has been completed.</i>

3
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:10,709
<i>And since our next assignment</i>
<i>will not begin for several days</i>

4
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:14,000
<i>we're enjoying a welcome</i>
<i>respite from our duties.</i>

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,875
If it's a boy, Michael,
after my father.

6
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:20,208
Wait a minute, we decided on
Hiro, after<i> my</i> father.

7
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,458
We talked about this
last night.

8
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,125
That's right, and we
decided on Hiro.

9
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,625
Wait. I've got it.

10
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,667
William. It's a great name--
William O'Brien.

11
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,750
It's got
a nice ring to it.

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,083
Oh... oh,
it's all right.

13
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,083
He's just doing
somersaults.

14
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,625
Here, feel.

15
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:37,917
Right there.

16
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:40,875
Oh. Going to be
a hell of a gymnast.

17
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:41,875
May I?

18
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,792
Sure. There.
Feel it?

19
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:46,375
When he's not turning,
he's kicking or punching.

20
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,250
When I want to sleep,
he wants to wake up.

21
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,333
At this point,
I just wish it were over.

22
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,291
I have to go.

23
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,750
I have a transporter
simulation on the bridge.

24
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,250
Bye-bye, Michael.

25
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:00,083
No.

26
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,834
Come on, Geordi.

27
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,375
No.

28
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,250
Just try it once.

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,667
It is not as hard
as you think.

30
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,125
I'm telling you,
you will be terrific.

31
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

32
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,041
All right.

33
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,875
(<i> sighs</i> )
It's silly.

34
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,250
♪ I am the very model
of a modern major general ♪

35
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,291
♪ I've information vegetable,
animal and mineral... ♪

36
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,333
Nah, I can't--
I can't do this.

37
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,500
Yes, you can!

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,625
I cannot sing
in front of people!

39
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,875
You were terrific!

40
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,208
You were
a little off pitch

41
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,834
but I think
I can take care of that.

42
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:43,583
Okay, La Forge is
the Modern Major General.

43
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,834
Captain, I'd like
to introduce you to

44
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:48,917
the winners of
the primary school science fair.

45
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:52,458
This is Marissa,
Jay Gordon, and Patterson.

46
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,166
They're here
for their tour.

47
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,625
Hello.

48
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,709
Can we see the Battle
Bridge and Torpedo Bay?

49
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,625
No, I'm afraid not,

50
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,291
but we will be visiting
the hydroponics

51
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,500
and the astrophysics
laboratories.

52
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,709
I'm sure you'll have
a wonderful time.

53
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,750
Well... if you'll
come with me.

54
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,166
I'm not sure
who to feel sorry for--

55
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,291
the captain or the kids.

56
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,083
I want you to know that
we're very proud

57
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,875
of our science fair
winners.

58
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,750
Perhaps some of you will...

59
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,041
choose to pursue a career
in Starfleet.

60
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,667
Well, then, um...

61
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,917
What did you do
for your science projects?

62
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:51,750
I planted radishes

63
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,792
in this special dirt,
and they came up all weird.

64
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:57,917
I see. That's very...
very commendable.

65
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,417
And you?

66
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:02,000
An analysis

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
of the lifespan of the swarming
moths on Gonal Four.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,291
They only live for 20 hours.

69
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,625
Then they all die.

70
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,375
How interesting.

71
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,959
And you?

72
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:15,834
(<i> crashing</i> )

73
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,792
(<i> kids screaming</i> )

74
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:20,834
PICARD: We're falling!

75
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,750
(<i> kids screaming</i> )

76
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,917
(<i> people shrieking</i> )

77
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,417
Uhh!

78
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:42,709
Agh!

79
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,542
(<i> crashing</i> )

80
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:47,000
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

81
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,375
What happened?

82
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,917
Sensors are picking up
subspace distortions

83
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,208
and high-energy particles
directly to starboard.

84
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,417
Looks like we ran into
a quantum filament.

85
00:03:58,417 --> 00:03:59,583
Damage report?

86
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,959
We've lost primary
life-support.

87
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,000
Switching
to secondary systems.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,291
Impulse and warp engines
are off-line.

89
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,542
There's another filament
moving toward us, sir.

90
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,917
All decks brace for impact.

91
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:49,667
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

92
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:53,834
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

93
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:56,166
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

94
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,166
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

95
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:03,750
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

96
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,917
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

97
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,000
Counselor.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,375
I'm all right.

99
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,667
Medical team
to the bridge.

100
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,208
Troi to sick bay.

101
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,542
TROI: Counselor Troi
to Captain Picard.

102
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,417
Troi to engineering.

103
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:30,959
Counselor Troi
to any crew member.

104
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,625
Please acknowledge.

105
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,208
Medical team
to the bridge.

106
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,500
The computer's down.

107
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,792
It looks like
we still have impulse power,

108
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:44,041
but not much else.

109
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,709
Lieutenant Monroe.

110
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,792
Chief O'Brien...

111
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,625
the turbolifts aren't working.

112
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,083
We're trapped up here.

113
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,875
(<i> kids crying</i> )

114
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:10,083
Are you...
are you children all right?...

115
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:30,166
Bridge, this is Picard.

116
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,000
This is the captain.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,083
Does anyone read me?

118
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,667
(crying)
Why don't they answer?

119
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,959
I don't know.

120
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,291
They're all dead.

121
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,500
PICARD:
They're not dead.

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,417
Communications down, that's all.

123
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,333
We're going to die too.

124
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:52,417
We most certainly are not.

125
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,458
Now, listen to me.

126
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,458
No one here
is going to die.

127
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:01,208
The bridge will be sending a
rescue party as soon as possible

128
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:05,250
so I want you all
to stop crying!

129
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,750
Everything is going
to be all right!

130
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,625
(<i> crying</i> )

131
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,041
(<i> kids sobbing</i> )

132
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,166
This is the Federation
Starship<i> Enterprise</i>

133
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,792
calling any vessel
within range.

134
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:25,834
We are in distress,
and need assistance.

135
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,542
Please respond.

136
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,417
(<i> static</i> )

137
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,709
I'm still not sure
if we're transmitting.

138
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:37,250
I'll set the message
on auto-repeat

139
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,208
and see if we get a response.

140
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,083
You all right?

141
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,959
I'm alive, what the hell
happened?

142
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,083
We were hit
by a quantum filament.

143
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,875
Most of our systems
are down.

144
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,208
We haven't been able to contact
anybody off the bridge.

145
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,875
Well, don't count on leaving
through there.

146
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,000
An emergency bulkhead closed
just beneath that lift.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,083
Confinement mode.

148
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,917
Right, isolation protocol.

149
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:08,125
I'm not really familiar
with that protocol.

150
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,000
If the computer
senses a hull breach

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,375
it automatically closes
emergency bulkheads

152
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,875
to isolate the breach.

153
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,291
Until we can clear
those bulkheads

154
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,875
we'll be cut off
from the rest of the ship.

155
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,709
MANDEL: I have partial sensors
back on line.

156
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,625
I'm picking up
sporadic life signs

157
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,834
throughout
the saucer section.

158
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:30,959
There are definitely
survivors.

159
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,166
What about ten forward?

160
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,208
Ten forward?

161
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,542
My wife's there.

162
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,375
I'm sorry, Chief.

163
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,000
The readings
are not that specific.

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,792
Can you scan
the drive section?

165
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,250
I'm not reading any
life signs in the drive section.

166
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,583
Could the sensors
be malfunctioning?

167
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,458
There's no way to know--
without the main computer

168
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,041
I can't run a full diagnostic.

169
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,208
Can you sense anything,
Counselor?

170
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,250
There are a lot
of people still alive.

171
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,834
Many of them are hurt,

172
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,250
but I can't tell
where they are.

173
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,125
We need to start
emergency procedures.

174
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,291
Who's the duty officer?

175
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,250
Lieutenant Monroe
was in command,

176
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,375
but she's dead.

177
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,875
I believe
counselor Troi

178
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,208
is the senior officer
on the deck.

179
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,667
Counselor Troi?

180
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,375
She carries the rank

181
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,250
of Lieutenant Commander.

182
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,166
I'd, uh...
I'd appreciate some suggestions.

183
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:33,000
I recommend we initiate
emergency procedure Alpha Two.

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,250
Bypass computer control,
and place

185
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,458
all systems
on manual override.

186
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,959
Very well.

187
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,125
Aye-aye, sir.

188
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,417
May I suggest that
our next priority be

189
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:45,041
to stabilize life-support

190
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,625
and to try to reestablish
internship communications.

191
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:51,166
Yes. Mr. Mandel, I'd like
you to assist Ensign Ro.

192
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,375
Yes, sir.

193
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,166
How are you feeling?

194
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,041
Okay. A little foggy.

195
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,291
Just lie still for a while.

196
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,375
We're going
to get you to sick bay

197
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,417
as soon as we can.

198
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:28,125
Okay.

199
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,959
Report.

200
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,250
I have surveyed
all the turbolifts

201
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,083
and service crawlways
on this deck.

202
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,250
Access to the bridge
has been completely severed

203
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,208
by emergency bulkheads.

204
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,917
Sick bay?

205
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:46,375
Heavy damage to section 23-A
has cut off access to sick bay.

206
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,667
I have ordered a security team
to bring casualties here

207
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,000
until further notice.

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,500
I think we should
assume the worst.

209
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,333
That everyone
on the bridge is dead.

210
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,917
There's no one
in control of this ship.

211
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,000
In that circumstance,
reestablishing control

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,959
of the ship should be
our top priority.

213
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,834
Agreed. Can we get
to engineering?

214
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,000
No, sir. The most direct
route is blocked.

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,792
But I believe we can use
the starboard service crawlway.

216
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,166
Okay--you and I will try
to get there.

217
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,625
Mr. Worf, this room is about

218
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,041
to fill up with wounded
in a few minutes,

219
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,166
and they're going
to need help.

220
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,166
I want you to stay
in charge here.

221
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,500
Yes, sir.

222
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,709
Let's go.

223
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,458
Over here.

224
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,959
Yes, sir.

225
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,667
Okay. Clear the power shunt.

226
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,458
COMPUTER: The shunt is cleared.

227
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:32,417
Right. And bypass
flow current, and...

228
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,125
The computer still won't
release the doors.

229
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,917
Can we force them open?

230
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:38,125
Yeah, we can try.

231
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,291
There's an emergency
hand actuator.

232
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,291
Geordi...

233
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,417
Yeah?

234
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,709
This wall is hot.

235
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,000
Where?

236
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,375
I'm all right.

237
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,166
But I think we've got
a new problem.

238
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,417
One of the energy conduits
must have ruptured

239
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:09,291
and ignited the polyduranide
inside the bulkhead.

240
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,542
That's a plasma fire.

241
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,917
It's putting out
a lot of radiation.

242
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,542
We can't stay here
much longer.

243
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,500
Yeah, but we've got a bigger
problem than that.

244
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,375
The quaratum in those
containers is used

245
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,583
in emergency thruster packs.

246
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,500
It's normally pretty
stable stuff,

247
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,917
but when you expose quaratum
to radiation

248
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:27,792
it has a way
of exploding.

249
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,542
The external power
is cut off.

250
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:44,125
We're going
to die.

251
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,417
Wh-What was that?

252
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,583
PICARD:
I don't know.

253
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

254
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:31,417
Your name is Marissa,
that right?

255
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:35,250
Well, Marissa, I need
a first officer to help me.

256
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,709
You're the oldest and so
that makes you my number one.

257
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,291
Number one?

258
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,333
That's what I always call
my first officer.

259
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,208
So...here.

260
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,667
There.

261
00:14:54,333 --> 00:15:00,583
Now, number one, we need a crew
to help us get that hatch off.

262
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,166
Don't you think

263
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,458
that Jay here would make
an excellent science officer?

264
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,417
What do you say, Jay?

265
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,834
Will you join our crew?

266
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,375
It's Jay Gordon.

267
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,500
Of course.
Forgive me, Jay Gordon.

268
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,375
I accept.

269
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,250
Here.

270
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,291
There.

271
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,375
Can I be
an officer too?

272
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,959
Well, let me see.

273
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,208
Your science project
involved radishes,

274
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,875
did it not?

275
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes, sir.

276
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,125
Then I shall appoint you

277
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,166
my executive officer
in charge of radishes.

278
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,125
There.

279
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,333
Right!

280
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,250
Then let's get to work.

281
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,208
13-65 Baker.

282
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,125
That should put us right
behind shuttlebay two.

283
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,709
That is correct, sir.

284
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,291
We have approximately 52 meters
remaining in this crawlway

285
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,792
before we can safely exit
into a main corridor...

286
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:05,792
(<i> whooshing</i> )

287
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,500
Coolant leak!

288
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:25,917
(<i> quiet hissing</i> )

289
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,458
We can withstand this
level of radiation

290
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,792
for another three or four hours
without any permanent damage.

291
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,875
We'll need a few days
of hyronalin treatments.

292
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,125
What are the radiation levels
in the quaratum?

293
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,583
They're at 83 rads

294
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,917
and rising at a rate of about
four rads per minute.

295
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,166
That stuff gets unstable
at about 350 rads.

296
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,917
I still haven't been
able to get any power

297
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,041
in this transporter.

298
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,041
The radiation level
is about 20% lower

299
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,959
at this end of the bay.

300
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,291
Let's move the containers
over to here.

301
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,375
That's a good idea.

302
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,834
It'll buy us some time.

303
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,125
You know, we're going
to have to do this by hand.

304
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,959
With all the radiation
floating around in here

305
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,125
we can't trust
the anti-grav units.

306
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:18,041
There, just before
the second time we were hit.

307
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,166
See the subspace distortion?

308
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,959
Yes.

309
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,709
How big is
a quantum filament?

310
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,500
Well, it could be
hundreds of meters long

311
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,250
but it has almost no mass

312
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,417
which makes it very
difficult to detect.

313
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:35,041
So it's like
a cosmic string.

314
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,083
No, that's a completely
different phenomenon.

315
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,458
How did you do that?

316
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,917
I diverted power
from the phaser array

317
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:51,041
and I dumped it into
the engineering control system.

318
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,834
You what?!

319
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,625
Engineering stations
on-line, counselor.

320
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:58,291
But that's a completely
improper procedure.

321
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,792
You can't just dump
that much raw energy

322
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,834
into a bridge
terminal without...

323
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:04,959
We're not going to get out of
this by playing it safe.

324
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,959
What is our
engine status, ensign?

325
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:16,041
We've got half impulse
power available.

326
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,208
But I'm getting some odd
readings from the warp drive.

327
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,542
I'm reading a spike
in the warp field array.

328
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,792
It looks like
a containment deviation.

329
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:27,000
Switch
to primary bypass.

330
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:31,125
Nothing.

331
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,208
Field strength's
at 40% and falling.

332
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,250
We've got a problem.

333
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,792
The quantum resonance of the
filament caused a polarity shift

334
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:41,417
in the anti-matter
containment field.

335
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,959
When the filament hit us,
the ship was momentarily charged

336
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:47,750
as if it had come in contact
with a live electrical wire.

337
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,250
That weakened
the containment field

338
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,917
surrounding
the anti-matter pods.

339
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:55,041
The field strength is
at 40% and it is still falling.

340
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:58,792
If it falls to 15%,
the field will collapse

341
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:00,792
and we'll have
a containment breach.

342
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,208
Which means?

343
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,959
Which means
the ship will explode.

344
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:17,333
Commander, the current cannot be
shut off from this relay box.

345
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,959
We can't just sit here.

346
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,375
If the energy flowing through
that arc were interrupted

347
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,166
by a non-conductive material,
it is likely

348
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,959
the circuit would be broken.

349
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,750
I don't see
anything in here

350
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,000
that'll handle
that much current.

351
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Commander, much
of my body framework

352
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,333
is made up of tripolymers,
a non-conductive material.

353
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,500
Are you suggesting
we use your body?

354
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,000
Yes, sir.

355
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:50,083
Data, there's half a million
amps going through that arc.

356
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,917
Could your body handle
that much current?

357
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:54,250
The power surge would cause

358
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,917
a systems failure
in my internal processors

359
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:58,834
and melt my
primary power couplings.

360
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:01,166
However, there
is a chance that

361
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,000
the damage would
not be irreparable.

362
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,834
No.

363
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:05,917
Commander...

364
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:07,792
our options
are very limited.

365
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,333
First of all, android or not,

366
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,750
I wouldn't ask anyone
to take that kind of risk.

367
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,959
Second, if the computer
is not working in engineering

368
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,709
I'm going to need your help
to get control of the ship.

369
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:18,875
My positronic brain has several
layers of shielding to

370
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,583
protect me from power surges.

371
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,208
It would be possible for you
to remove my cranial unit

372
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,458
and take it with you.

373
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,417
Let me get this straight.

374
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:32,291
You want me
to take off your head?

375
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,667
Yes, sir.

376
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,417
Is something wrong, sir?

377
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,417
Well, Data...

378
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,500
Would you be all right?

379
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,041
My memory core and neural nets
are self-contained.

380
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,458
I would be fine, sir.

381
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,583
Well, like you said...

382
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,417
our options are limited.

383
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:14,333
Data!

384
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,375
Oh... Data.

385
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,792
Data.

386
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:30,667
A remarkable experience,
commander.

387
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,291
Are you all right?

388
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,792
Did the shielding work?

389
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,375
Apparently so, sir.

390
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,291
My neural nets
are fully operational.

391
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,875
You may begin by opening
the ventral access panel

392
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:45,291
located two centimeters
below my right ear.

393
00:21:58,792 --> 00:21:59,959
(Jay Gordon)
Ah!

394
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,625
Can you climb up?

395
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,291
Yes, I think so.

396
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,333
Good.

397
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,667
Now look down
the sides of the lift.

398
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:18,375
Can you see
two big clamps?

399
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,375
Yes, I see them.

400
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,458
Can you see if those clamps
are attached to...

401
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:27,166
long beams inside
big grooves?

402
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes.

403
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,291
But one of them
looks broken.

404
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:37,166
It's half out of the groove.

405
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,542
All right, come down.

406
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,500
All right.

407
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:50,375
Guh! Uhh!

408
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,041
Number one.

409
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:10,959
Those big clamps are
part of the emergency system.

410
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,959
If anything goes wrong

411
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,917
they're designed to hold
the turbolift in place.

412
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:19,500
But it would seem
that they're damaged.

413
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,917
Is that why
we keep shaking?

414
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,417
That's right.

415
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:28,458
Now, when they give way,
we shall fall,

416
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,166
so you've got to get
your crew out of here

417
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,333
before that happens.

418
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,125
Now there's a ladder

419
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,917
that runs along the wall
of the shaft.

420
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:40,750
You can climb up that until
you come to an open doorway.

421
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,583
(<i> creaking</i> )

422
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:50,875
Well...
what about you?

423
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,792
My ankle is broken.

424
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:57,583
I will just slow you down,
and you need to move quickly.

425
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:01,709
Now you are the leader,
and that's an order.

426
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:12,083
We have to climb
up the shaft.

427
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,041
I want to stay here
with you, Captain.

428
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:18,959
Patterson, you're an officer.
You have to obey orders.

429
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,375
I don't want to be
an officer anymore.

430
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,375
I want to stay here
with you.

431
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:26,166
If the captain stays
here, we won't make it.

432
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,458
We'll all die.

433
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,166
We don't have time to argue.

434
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,792
You must go<i> now.</i>

435
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,959
The crew has decided
to stick together.

436
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:46,000
We all go or we all stay.

437
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:55,750
All right, I'll try.

438
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,917
But I want you to know
this is mutiny.

439
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:01,750
Now, number one,

440
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,041
look at that control panel.

441
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:09,959
Now, the yellow control pad,
hit that once.

442
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:13,834
Now, the one below it,
hit it twice.

443
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:16,583
Now that should release
the panel underneath.

444
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,625
Yes, it did.

445
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,875
Now, you can
pull it away.

446
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:22,834
Okay.

447
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,333
Good.

448
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:27,417
Now that bundle of wires,
that's optical cabling.

449
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:28,834
See how much of that
you can pull out.

450
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,458
The levels
are still rising.

451
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:48,500
There must be some way
to put that fire out.

452
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,083
The energy's fed by the ship's
internal power grid.

453
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,917
And we can't get near that.

454
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:54,250
The only way to stop it

455
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,750
would be to eliminate
its oxygen supply.

456
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,959
Wait a minute.

457
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:03,375
Doctor, I've got an idea.

458
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,750
Now it's kind of wild,
but we just might be able

459
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,875
to kill two birds
with one stone.

460
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,000
Let's hear it.

461
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,333
Okay. We open
the external door.

462
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:12,458
That would depressurize
the cargo bay

463
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,500
and suck all of these
containers out into space.

464
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,041
At the same time,

465
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,458
the lack of oxygen should put
out the plasma fire.

466
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,959
What about us?

467
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,291
We just need to find
something in here to hold onto

468
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,500
while the air
is evacuating.

469
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,875
Then we close the door,
repressurize the bay.

470
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,041
What about this?

471
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,583
Yeah.

472
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,458
Yeah, that ought
to do it.

473
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,083
There,
that should do it.

474
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,500
There will be a sharp pain
as I set the bone.

475
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,792
Prepare yourself.

476
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:51,291
Agh! Ooh!

477
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:52,500
Good.

478
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,709
Good, you bore
that well.

479
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:59,583
Ohh.

480
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:00,959
WORF:
Keiko?

481
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,417
I'm all right...

482
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:03,917
I think.

483
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,583
Perhaps you
should lie down.

484
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,583
Ohh!

485
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:10,542
Ohh! Uhh!

486
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,166
I'm having contractions.

487
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,625
I believe
that is not uncommon

488
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,500
in the late months
of pregnancy.

489
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,750
No, I mean<i> contractions.</i>

490
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,750
I'm going into labor.

491
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,959
You cannot.

492
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,917
This is not
a good time, Keiko.

493
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,041
It's not open for debate.

494
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:32,291
Like it or not,
this baby is coming.

495
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,250
If the containment
field strength

496
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,291
continues to drop
at its present rate,

497
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,625
we still have
at least two hours

498
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,208
before it
becomes critical.

499
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,542
But you're ignoring the fact

500
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:50,250
that the power coupling
is also damaged.

501
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,667
If that coupling overheats,

502
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,041
the field strength could drop
a lot faster.

503
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:56,375
We could have a containment
breach in a matter of minutes.

504
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,000
What do you suggest?

505
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,917
We should separate
the saucer now

506
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:02,542
and put as much
distance as possible

507
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:03,959
between us
and the drive section.

508
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,750
Excuse me, sir,

509
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,667
but that's damn
cold-blooded.

510
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,250
What about
the people down there?

511
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,417
There's no evidence
that anyone is alive

512
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:12,583
in the drive section.

513
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,458
No evidence
they're dead, either.

514
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,208
If you were
trapped down there,

515
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,291
would you like us
to cut you loose

516
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:19,500
and just leave?

517
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,250
No, of course not.

518
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,542
But I also wouldn't
expect the Bridge crew

519
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:25,834
to risk the safety of the ship
and hundreds of lives

520
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,417
in a futile effort
to rescue me.

521
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:44,417
You said there was no way
to stabilize

522
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,250
the containment field
from the bridge.

523
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,083
Could it be done
from engineering?

524
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:51,375
Yes, but my readings
indicate there's no power there.

525
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,583
They don't even have monitors
to tell them there's a problem.

526
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,959
Could we divert energy
from the bridge

527
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,166
to those monitors?

528
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,667
Yes, sir.

529
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,083
I will say it again:

530
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,834
there is no reason to believe

531
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:05,000
that anyone is still alive
in engineering.

532
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,750
We're wasting time
even talking about this.

533
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,834
We have to separate
the ship<i> now.</i>

534
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:14,417
I believe there are still people
alive down there...

535
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:17,709
and I'm going to give them
every chance.

536
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:19,125
Assuming they're alive,
they'll be hoping

537
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,583
there's someone up here
who can help them,

538
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:24,417
so we'll help them.

539
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:27,291
Chief, divert the necessary
power to engineering.

540
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:29,125
Aye, sir.

541
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,291
I remind you, Counselor,

542
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:40,125
that power coupling
could overheat at any moment.

543
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,834
By not separating
the ship now,

544
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:44,375
you could be responsible
for all our deaths.

545
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,458
Thank you, Ensign.

546
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,000
Proceed.

547
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,291
I can't open this door.

548
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,667
We're going to have to climb up
to the next deck.

549
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,834
(sighs)

550
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:47,792
What if that one
doesn't open, either?

551
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:49,750
Then we'll never get out.

552
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,834
MARISSA:
Quiet! Both of you!

553
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:53,333
That's an order.

554
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,166
PICARD:
We're going up.

555
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:56,166
Ready?

556
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:57,333
Ready, sir!

557
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,458
(<i> loud clatter</i> )

558
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:00,166
The lift's falling.
Hang on!

559
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,208
(<i> distant crash</i> )

560
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:09,542
PICARD:
We're all right.

561
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:12,125
We're going to keep on climbing.

562
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,291
Just don't look down.

563
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,166
(<i> crying</i> )

564
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,417
What's wrong?!

565
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,834
He's scared.

566
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:25,417
We're right with you,
Patterson.

567
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,083
You're not going to fall.

568
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,667
Everything will be all right
if you just keep climbing.

569
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,417
(<i> grunting</i> )

570
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:33,166
What we need...

571
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,208
is a climbing song.

572
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,083
Marissa, is there a song

573
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,208
that you sing
at school?

574
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:42,834
Um... "The Laughing Vulcan
and His Dog"?

575
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,500
I'm afraid
I don't know that one.

576
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,041
I know!

577
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,083
<i>"Frere Jacques."</i>

578
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,417
That's a song I used to sing
when I was at school.

579
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:52,625
Patterson?

580
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,709
Do you know that one?

581
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:56,625

Oh! Ohh!

600
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:55,500
Dilation has gone
to seven centimeters

601
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,542
since the onset of labor.

602
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,667
That did not take long.

603
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:01,417
It's easy for you to say.

604
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,792
Ahh!

605
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:05,250
(<i> panting</i> )

606
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:11,041
You are doing very well.

607
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:13,208
I'm sure the child
will arrive soon.

608
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,041
Whew! Ahh.

609
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,917
Worf, has the baby turned?

610
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,625
Turned?

611
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,834
So the head is down.

612
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:27,667
Dr. Crusher told me
a few days ago that it hadn't.

613
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:28,917
She wasn't worried

614
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:31,417
because I still had
a month to go.

615
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:33,041
I am not certain.

616
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,417
Can't you tell?

617
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:36,875
Worf, have you ever
done this before...

618
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:39,500
delivered a baby?

619
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,458
Yes... no.

620
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,834
I took the Starfleet
emergency medical course.

621
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,917
In a computerized
simulation,

622
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:49,542
I assisted in delivery
of a human baby.

623
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:52,583
Sometimes it doesn't
go by the book, Worf.

624
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:55,208
(<i> groaning</i> )

625
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,291
I am sure

626
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:58,250
everything
will be fine.

627
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,750
Once the air is vented,
the first thing

628
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,917
you'll feel is an extreme
pressure on your lungs.

629
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:09,875
You have to resist
the temptation to exhale.

630
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:12,125
Next, our hands and feet
will get cold, then numb.

631
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,792
And some of the capillaries

632
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,291
on the exposed sections
of the skin may burst.

633
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:16,917
Sounds like fun.

634
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:20,083
We will have about 15 seconds
of useful consciousness,

635
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:23,333
then about ten seconds
of extreme disorientation,

636
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:24,458
then we pass out.

637
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:27,542
Okay. Once the air
is evacuated,

638
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:29,667
one of us is going to need
to get to that panel

639
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:33,083
to repressurize the bay.

640
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,834
We're ready.

641
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,375
Are you okay?

642
00:34:57,125 --> 00:35:04,834
(<i> inhaling and exhaling</i> )

643
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,500
(<i> panting</i> )

644
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,250
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

645
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:08,000
RO: The field strength
is down to 20%.

646
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,750
We cannot run the risk
of staying here any longer.

647
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,458
We're in no danger
till it drops below 15%.

648
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:14,875
We can afford to wait and see

649
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,834
if someone in engineering
notices those monitors.

650
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:20,041
Have you made preparations
to separate the saucer section?

651
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:23,125
Yes, sir. We're in stand-by mode
for docking latches...

652
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,125
Ensign, there's
a thermal inversion

653
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,500
in the power coupling!

654
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,583
Quick! Cross connect it
to the transfer coil.

655
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,417
That was close.

656
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:34,709
What happened?

657
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:36,333
Exactly what I said
might happen--

658
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,834
the power coupling
overheated

659
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:39,959
and the entire containment
field almost collapsed.

660
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:42,000
O'Brien's fixed it
temporarily,

661
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,875
but this could happen
again at any moment,

662
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:47,083
and next time we might not
be able to stop it.

663
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:50,875
You can't let wishful thinking
guide your decision, Counselor.

664
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,500
It's time to leave.

665
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,875
We will separate the ship
when I decide that it's time

666
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,750
and not before.

667
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,250
Is that clear, Ensign?

668
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,792
Yes. Perfectly.

669
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,709
Okay, try it.

670
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,166
Very good, Commander.

671
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:26,333
You have established
a connection.

672
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,417
I can now raise the door.

673
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,208
There's no power
on this entire deck,

674
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,917
and yet somehow
these monitors are working.

675
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:37,917
The power reaching
those monitors

676
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:40,250
has been diverted
from the bridge, sir.

677
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,917
But why?

678
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:45,000
Unless there's something
they want us...

679
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,750
something they<i> need</i> us to see.

680
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,208
Wait a minute. Data,
the containment field strength

681
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,875
is down to 18%--
can you stabilize it?

682
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,709
No, sir. I do not have access
to the containment field.

683
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:57,875
You will have to establish

684
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,166
a new link.

685
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:06,250
Locate the O.D.N.
conduit, sir.

686
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:09,333
Got it.
Yes, sir.

687
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,583
You must now change
the input matrix

688
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,333
of my secondary optical port

689
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,291
and then connect
the O.D.N. conduit.

690
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,333
That is not
the correct port, sir.

691
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,250
Sorry.

692
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,125
You must hurry,
Commander.

693
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:29,709
The containment field
has dropped to 16%.

694
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:31,917
I'm trying.
You need a bigger head.

695
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,458
The field continues
to drop, sir.

696
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:37,000
Collapse is imminent.

697
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,709
Try it now?

698
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:44,750
I have made
a connection, sir.

699
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,917
I am now stabilizing
the containment field.

700
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:51,041
O'BRIEN:
Sir, the field strength

701
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,792
is stabilizing.

702
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,083
18%...

703
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,041
20...

704
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,333
25...

705
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,041
I guess they got
our message.

706
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:08,291
I was wrong,
Counselor.

707
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,792
You could have
easily been right.

708
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,125

709
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,709

711
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,250
WORF:
Congratulations.

712
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,458
You are fully
dilated to 10cm.

713
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:25,000
You may now give birth.

714
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,250
Ohh! That's what
I've been doing.

715
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,458
Well, bearing down
is the next stage.

716
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,875
It should start
at full dilation.

717
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,417
Why has it not begun?

718
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:41,000
I don't know!

719
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,625
I don't think it's up to me.

720
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,750
It happens
when it happens!

721
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,458
My computer simulation
was not like this.

722
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,750
That delivery
was very orderly.

723
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,291
Well, I'm sorry!

724
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,583
Uhh! Uhh!

725
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,750
(<i> groaning</i> )

726
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,834
Did you feel an
uncontrollable urge to push?

727
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:00,625
(<i> groans loudly</i> )

728
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,458
Good.
You are bearing down.

729
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:07,333
Now you must push
with each contraction

730
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:10,667
and I must urge you gently
but firmly to push harder.

731
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:13,834
Push, Keiko.

732
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:15,083
Push hard.

733
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:17,000
Push, Keiko.

734
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,667
Push. Push!

735
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:19,917
Push!

736
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:21,709
I am pushing!

737
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:25,000
The baby is emerging
head first.

738
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,458
One more contraction.

739
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:28,709
(<i> straining</i> )
Oh-kay. Agh!

740
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:29,959
That's good.

741
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,917
Push.

742
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,542
Push.

743
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:34,458
Hard!

744
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,917
(<i> wails</i> )

745
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:37,917
I have the baby.

746
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:38,875
Ohh!

747
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:41,500
(laughing)
Oh. Oh.

748
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,792
Now I will smack the child
to induce breathing.

749
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:45,792
(<i> light smacking</i> )

750
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:48,667
(<i> baby crying</i> )

751
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:58,542
I will cut
the umbilical cord.

752
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:06,959
Blanket.

753
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,041
I believe she looks
like Chief O'Brien.

754
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:28,041
(<i> laughing</i> )

755
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,208
Ohh.

756
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,542
You were wonderful, Worf.

757
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:45,959
I couldn't have done it
without you.

758
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:48,125
Hello.
(<i> baby cooing</i> )

759
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:50,166
(<i> giggling</i> )
Hello.

760
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,667
<i>Captain's Log: Supplemental.</i>

761
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:56,709
<i>We are en route to Starbase 67</i>
<i>to undergo repairs.</i>

762
00:42:56,709 --> 00:43:01,000
<i>Life aboard the</i> Enterprise
<i>is slowly returning to normal.</i>

763
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:06,750
Now just wait here.

764
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:12,792
You just can't stay away
from the big chair, can you?

765
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:15,166
I don't think I'm
cut out to be Captain.

766
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:18,041
First Officer, maybe.

767
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:20,625
I understand there
aren't many qualifications.

768
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,625
Captain Picard to the bridge,
please.

769
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:33,125
Hello.

770
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,291
It's good to see you again.

771
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:36,083
What brings you
to the Bridge?

772
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:38,125
In appreciation
for the way you helped us

773
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,583
get out of the turbo shaft

774
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,750
and the way you helped us
not be scared,

775
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,125
we want to present to you
this commemorative plaque.

776
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,458
Give it to him.

777
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,250
Well, thank you.

778
00:43:57,542 --> 00:43:59,125
Thank you very much.

779
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:01,250
I made the back piece.

780
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:06,083
Oh, and a wonderful job
you did of it, too.

781
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:08,083
Well, later this afternoon

782
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,250
we're going to finish
the tour I promised you,

783
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,083
starting with
the Battle Bridge.

784
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,041
I'll see you at 1400 hours.

785
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,792
You have the Bridge,
number one.

786
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:17,208
RIKER AND MARISSA:
Aye, sir.
