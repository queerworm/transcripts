<i>We are en route to Mintaka 3</i>

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,917
<i>where a three-man Federation</i>
<i>anthropological field team</i>

4
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:14,125

00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,333
<i>Our mission is to resupply</i>

6
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,083
<i>and repair their</i>
<i>malfunctioning reactor.</i>

7
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,875
Mr. La Forge, report.

8
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,291
Well, we finished replicating
the parts they'll need.

9
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,792
But what I don't
understand is why

10
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,709
a three-man station
would need a reactor

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,458
capable of producing
4.2 gigawatts.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,291
RIKER: Enough to power
a small phaser bank

13
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,375
or a subspace relay
station or...

14
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:36,000
Or a hologram
generator.

15
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,917
Oh, a "duck blind."

16
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,583
Right, they're
anthropologists.

17
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:43,083
Mm-hmm, who are studying an
extended family of Mintakans

18
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,792
at close range, from a
camouflaged observation post.

19
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:49,458
According to Dr. Barron's
preliminary reports,

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,291
the Mintakans are
proto-Vulcan humanoids

21
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,917
at the Bronze Age level.

22
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,208
Quite peaceful,
and highly rational.

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,041
Which is not surprising,
considering how closely

24
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,000
their evolution
parallels Vulcan.

25
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:03,333
Captain, incoming transmission
from Mintaka 3.

26
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,709
Thank you, Lieutenant.

28
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:10,542
Our temporary repairs
have failed.

29
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,250
The reactor is now inoperative.

30
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,959
PICARD:
Do you have battery backup?

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,625
Three hours at best.

32
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,291
Captain, if we
increase to warp 7,

33
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,333
we can be there in 23 minutes.

34
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,333
PICARD:
Make it so.

35
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,542
We're on our way.

36
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,000
(<i> explosion,</i>
<i>woman groaning</i> )

37
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,792
We've lost contact, sir.

38
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:58,041
Increase to warp 9.

39
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:31,750
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

40
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:35,625
<i>These are the voyages</i>

GEORDI: The framework's
still charged, so watch it.

46
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:18,125
Why did we have
to come so early?

47
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,041
When the sun reaches
its zenith,

48
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,834
I have to be ready to
take the measurements.

49
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:25,250
You'll be ready. You've read
the sundial hundreds of times.

50
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,792
Yes, Father, but never as
the appointed record keeper.

51
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,834
You're taking your duties
quite seriously.

52
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,542
Your mother would have
been very proud of you.

53
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,834
What is that?

54
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,125
Up there, Father.
What is it?

55
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,125
I don't know.

56
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,166
Keep work--
Palmer?

57
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,375
BEVERLY: It's all right,

58

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,041
All we need now
is power.

60
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,500
Almost there.

61
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,291

73
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,542
SICK BAY:
Aye, Doctor.

74
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,083
That should do it.

75
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,083
You increased the levels
of tricortisine?

76
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,750
PICARD:
Dr. Crusher.

77
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,542
Before you start quoting
me the prime directive,

78
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,709
he'd already seen us.
The damage was done.

79
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,667
It was either bring him
aboard or let him die.

80
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:24,041
Then why didn't you
let him die?

81
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,208
Because<i> we</i> were responsible
for his injuries.

82
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:33,125
I'm not sure that I concur
with that reasoning, Doctor.

83
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,875
But now that he's here,
you must remove all memory

84
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,750
of his encounter with
the away team.

85
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,917
By erasing
short-term recall?

86
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,417
It has been
accomplished before.

87
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,250
I am familiar with
Dr. Pulaski's technique.

88
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,834
But I can't guarantee
it'll be effective

89
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,417
on Mintakan
brain chemistry.

90
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,417
Their lysosome levels
are much lower.

91
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,542
BARRON: Wait, no, no!
We must evacuate.

92
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,083
Dr. Barron, you're
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

93
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,417
You're safe.

94
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,542
The others?

95
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,709
Dr. Warren is here.
We are doing all we can.

96
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,417
BARRON:
And Palmer, where is Palmer?

97
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,917
PICARD:
He's still on Mintaka 3.

98
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,709
BARRON:
Picard, you have to find him.

99
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,917
PICARD: We will.
BARRON: He may be hurt.

100
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:16,166
Rest assured, we shall not
leave until he is located.

101
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,750
Thank you, Picard.

102
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,083
Picard to bridge.
Report.

103
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,917
WORF: Scans of the planet
detect no humans, Captain.

104
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,417
Very well, put us in
a close orbit.

105
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,291
WORF: Sir, the close orbit
will increase sensor efficiency

106
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,291
by only four percent.

107
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,291
I want that four percent,
Lieutenant.

108
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,500
WORF:
Aye, sir.

109
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:42,000

110
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:45,083
Picard.

111
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,667
Damn.

112
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,875
Well, Doctor,
your next task is clear.

113
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,792
Oji?

114
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:31,166
Oji!

115
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,709
Oji!

116
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,458
Oji!

117
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,500
Father?

118
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,917
Here.

119
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,208
Oji.

120
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,709
Father!

121
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,875
I thought I'd...
Oji!

122
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,709
...never see you again.

123
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,917
When you and the
woman vanished,

124
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,917
I was sure
you were dead.

125
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,792
I think I was.

126
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:05,000
But I was brought
back to life.

127
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:09,417
Oji, I awoke in
an incredible place

128
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,917
and my wounds
were gone.

129
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,417
I had been healed.

130
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,917
How is that possible?

131
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:27,417
Long ago, our people believed
in beings with great powers.

132
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,583
And those beings
made the rains come.

133
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,375
They told the sun
when to rise.

134
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:35,083
They caused all life to
be born, to grow, to die.

135
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,709
But those are just tales,
Father, old superstitions.

136
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,375
But perhaps the beliefs
of our ancestors are true.

137
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:47,125
Nothing else can explain
what's happened.

138
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,709
Everything has
changed now, Oji.

139
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,125
We must tell the others.

140
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,917
Barron is stable,
but Warren is still critical.

141
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,458
Palmer is missing.

142
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,750
Scan of the planet shows
Mintakan life-forms only.

143
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,125
No humans, however...

144
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,583
The area around
the duck blind

145
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,458
exhibits karst topography--

146
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,375
sinkholes, underground
rivers and caverns.

147
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,709
And the rock strata
contains a high concentration

148
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,000
of thallium compound,

149
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,834
which may be obstructing
our sensor beams.

150
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,709
So, if Palmer, in his
delirium, fled into a cave,

151
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,417
we may be unable to
detect his life signs.

152
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,208
Correct, sir.

153
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,625
Captain, if he is still alive,
he needs medical attention.

154
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,792
We must send an away
team to locate him.

155
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,500
TROI:
But our presence must not

156
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:34,458
interfere with the cultural
development of the Mintakans.

157
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,417
Agreed. Further contamination
must be prevented.

158
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,458

Mintakan emotions

172

Like the Vulcans, they have
highly ordered minds.

173

A very sensible people.

174
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:26,834
For example, Mintakan women
precede their mates.

175
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,583
It's a signal to other women.

176
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,291
"This man's taken.
Get your own"?

177
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,750
Not precisely.

178
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,625
More like, "If you
want his services,

179
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,458
I'm the one you have
to negotiate with."

180
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,083
What kind of "services"?

181
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,917
All kinds.

182
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,041
They are a sensible race.

183
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,875
FATHER:
I understand your skepticism.

184
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,500
If it hadn't happened to me,

185
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,583
I would find it difficult
to accept as well.

186
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,709
OJI: But it did happen,
just as we've said.

187
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,208
FATHER: Fento, you know the
legends better than anyone.

188
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,083
Do they not speak of beings
like the kind I've seen...

189
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,500
Who could vanish
like smoke?

190
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:29,083
There are the stories
of the overseer,

191
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,792
who could appear
and disappear at will.

192
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:35,583
And couldn't this overseer
heal the dead?

193
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:40,625
FENTO: He had supreme power,
or so our ancestors believed.

194
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:44,959
I believe I have seen
the overseer.

195
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He is called... the Picard.

196
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,875
Uh-oh.
His memory is intact.

197
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,500
The procedure
didn't work.

198
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:55,458
Liko, all this talk
of supernatural beings,

199
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,000
no one has believed that for
countless generations.

200
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,000
Just as we
no longer believe

201
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,917
that the stars
control our fates

202
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:05,750
or the spirits of the
dead haunt the living.

203
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:11,917
Nuria, I'm not saying that
all the old beliefs are true.

204
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:14,417
But I did see the Picard.

205
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,166
And I was restored
back to life.

206
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,792
We are visitors.

207
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,959
We've come to trade
our cloth.

208
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,083
May we speak?

209
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,458
Please do.

210
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,041
We welcome outsiders.

211
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,250
I am Nuria.

212
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:32,125
I am Troi,
and this is Riker.

213
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,500
You had a very
interesting dream.

214
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,750
Dream?

215
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:39,333
It was real.

216
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,750
My father and I both
witnessed these beings.

217
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,667
If you are father
and daughter,

218
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:47,250
you may well have
shared the same dream.

219
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,333
That is not reasonable.

220
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,625
Is that any less
reasonable than being

221
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,625
magically transformed
to another place

222
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:55,709
by the Picard?

223
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,959
MAN:
Nuria!

224
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,333
LIKO:
It has to be Palmer.

225
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,500
The one the Picard
wished to find.

226
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:05,375
Remarkable-- you were
speaking the truth.

227
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,458
The Picard will be pleased.

228
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,333
(<i> overlapping chatter</i> )

229
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,375
Riker to Picard.

230
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:15,917
PICARD:
Go ahead, Number One.

231
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,250
We have a problem.

232
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,000
The contamination?

233
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,834
RIKER: It's worse than
we suspected.

234
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,125
The Mintakans are beginning
to believe in a god.

235
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,583
RIKER: And the one
they've chosen is you.

236
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,125
Picard, you must beam
Palmer aboard immediately.

237
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,959
Without medical attention--
It's not simple as that.

238
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,542
He is surrounded
by Mintakans.

239
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,458
If he should dematerialize
before their eyes--

240
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,875
It will slightly increase
the cultural contamination

241
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,583
which already exists.

242
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,542
A small price for
saving Palmer's life.

243
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,333
Number One, is there any
chance of freeing Palmer

244
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,500
and transporting up unseen?

245
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,625
We can try.

246
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:58,875
PICARD:
Try hard.

247
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:01,000
Picard out.
Picard, I must protest.

248
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,417
You're endangering
Palmer with this delay.

249
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,291
I am aware of that.

250
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,500
But each of us,
including Dr. Palmer,

251
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:12,291
took an oath that we would
uphold the prime directive--

252
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,250
if necessary, with our lives.

253
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:19,125
HALI: Rego and I were
hunting off the third ridge.

254
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,917
We followed a hornbuck
into a cave.

255
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,792
The stranger
was there asleep.

256
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:25,083
This Palmer is one of
the overseer's servants?

257
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:29,250
Yes, the Picard
has many servants.

258
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,834
Isn't that true, Fento?

259
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,542
According to legend.

260
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,750
But if this Palmer is a
servant of the overseer,

261
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,834
what was he doing
in the cave?

262
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,542
Perhaps he ran away.

263
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,417
Or he failed the Picard somehow
and was hiding from him.

264
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,375
Then we should bind him,
in case he wakes

265
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,500
and tries to escape.

266
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,250
It's senseless
for this stranger

267
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,458
to be held captive.

268
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,625
All this talk
of the overseer--

269
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,333
it's old superstitions.

270
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,917
NURIA:
I disagree.

271
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:58,166
All the evidence indicates
that the overseer exists.

272
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,875
And I heard
the Picard say

273
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:01,500
he wanted to
find Palmer.

274
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,875
(<i> group muttering</i> )

275
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:07,667
Then by keeping Palmer safe,
we will please the Picard.

276
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:10,667
And he will grant us
favors in return.

277
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,083
Favors?

278
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,792
It is said that the
overseer is all-powerful.

279
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:18,208
He can provide
gentle winters,

280
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,083
plentiful hunting,
fertile crops, anything.

281
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:26,500
He could even bring back
those who have died.

282
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,208
NURIA:
It's agreed.

283
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,083
We will save Palmer
for the Picard.

284
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,375
(<i> group agreeing</i> )

285
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,750
I've seen another one
like Palmer.

286
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,667
LIKO: Another servant
of the Picard?

287
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,041
He's headed towards the caves.

288
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,208
Fento, stay and
bind Palmer.

289
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,208
(<i> group chattering</i> )

290
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,750
Over there.

291
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:05,709
Well, that knot won't hold.
If I may?

292
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,208
Please do.

293
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,542
You need a knot that'll
tighten under pressure.

294
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,750
Let me show you.

295
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:25,792
Father, the sun's
reaching its zenith.

296
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,166
If I don't go
to measure--

297
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,291
Go.

298
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,709
Forgive me, friend,

299
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,375
but the stranger
must be set free.

300
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,625
Riker?

301
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,333
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

302
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,083
Lock on and prepare to beam us
directly to sick bay,

303
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,417
but hang on for my signal.

304
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,959
DATA:
Acknowledged, Commander.

305
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,417
Riker, stop!

306
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,041
Riker!

307
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,000
Oji?!

308
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,500
It's Riker.
He's taking Palmer!

309
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:22,417
Hali! Yari!
Don't let her escape!

310
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:30,959
I'm clear.
Energize.

311
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,166
Data, has Counselor Troi
beamed up?

312
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,834
DATA:
Negative, Commander.

313
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:53,000
Sensors show she is in the midst
of a group of Mintakans.

314
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,333
Damn.

315
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:04,291
NURIA:
He is all right.

316
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:07,500
Hali, find Riker
and Palmer.

317
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:12,375
Why did you and Riker
take Palmer from us?

318
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:13,959
We did not take Palmer.

319
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,709
TROI: We set him free.

320
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,834
Riker and I do not believe in
these fables about an overseer.

321
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,250
LIKO: Don't you realize
what you've done?

322
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,959
You have angered the Picard,
and we may all suffer for it.

323
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,542
I know. I've seen him.

324
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,125
He is all-powerful.

325
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:32,917
Fento, weren't there
stories about the overseer

326
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:35,542
destroying those
who offended him?

327
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,250
Stories, nothing more.

328
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,625
Liko, we'll get
Palmer back.

329
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:43,333
Riker was carrying him.
They can't have gone far.

330
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:47,959
Still, the Picard may blame us
for letting Palmer escape.

331
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:55,166
Perhaps we should punish her.

332
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,750
Let the overseer know that
she and Riker acted alone.

333
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:01,500
We will keep Troi captive.

334
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:02,959
That's not enough.

335
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,500
You would have us harm her?

336
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,000
If it will hold off
the Picard's anger, yes.

337
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,375
I've seen how powerful he is.

338
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:24,500
I am unwilling
to hurt her needlessly.

339
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:27,208
We will wait for Hali to return.

340
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,792
And if they
don't find Palmer?

341
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:38,792
Then we may do
as Liko suggests.

342
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,291
Doctor, you believe
the Mintakans

343
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,875
are capable of
harming Counselor Troi?

344
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:52,166
They are not normally
a violent people,

345
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,667
but these are
extraordinary circumstances.

346
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,166
They're trying
to comprehend

347
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,166
what they believe
to be a god.

348
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

349
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,542
Recommendations?

350
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,625
The Mintakans wish to
please the overseer,

351
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,458
but they can only
guess what he wants.

352
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,083
They need a sign.

353
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,792
Are you suggesting...?

354
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,417
You must go down to Mintaka 3.

355
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,208
Masquerading as a god?!

356
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,166
Absolutely out of the question.
The prime directive--

357
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,375
BARRON:
Has already been violated.

358
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:21,875
The damage is done.

359
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,750
All we can do now
is minimize it.

360
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:25,625
By sanctioning
their false beliefs?

361
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,667
By giving them guidelines.

362
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:30,041
Letting them know what
the overseer expects of them.

363
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,709
Dr. Barron, I cannot.

364
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,125
I will not impose a set of
commandments on these people.

365
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,083
To do so violates the very
essence of the prime directive.

366
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,792
Like it or not,
we have rekindled

367
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:41,792
the Mintakans belief
in the overseer.

368
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,875
RIKER: And are you saying
that this belief

369
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,625
will eventually become a
religion?

370
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,333
It's inevitable.

371
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,417
And without guidance,
that religion

372
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,709
could degenerate
into inquisitions,

373
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,083
holy wars, chaos.

374
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:58,959
Horrifying.

375
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,959
Dr. Barron...

376
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,917
your report describes
how rational these people are.

377
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:07,625
Millennia ago,

378
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,667
they abandoned their belief
in the supernatural.

379
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:14,041
Now, you are asking me to
sabotage that achievement.

380
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:17,166
To send them back into the
dark ages of superstition

381
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,709
and ignorance and fear.

382
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,583
No!

383
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:29,083
We will find some way to
undo the damage we've caused.

384
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:35,542
Number One, tell me
about this group's leader.

385
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:40,291
Nuria-- exceptionally
clear-minded, sensible.

386
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,291
The Mintakans
trust her judgment.

387
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,750
If we could convince her
that you are not a god...

388
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:47,000
She might be able to
persuade the others.

389
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:50,458
And how do you
propose to convince her?

390
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,625
She believes that Picard
is a magical figure.

391
00:26:57,417 --> 00:27:01,500
I'm gonna show her
how the magic works.

392
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,834
I'm gonna bring her aboard.

393
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,125
DATA: Counselor, sensors
indicate five Mintakans

394
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,834
in your immediate
vicinity.

395
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,500
Four are motionless.

396
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:16,500
The fifth is eight meters away,
proceeding south.

397
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,750
Is Nuria one of these five?

398
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:20,166
Mm-hmm.

399
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,500
Was that intended
as an affirmative?

400
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,917
Yes, Data, it was.

401
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:27,166
Is Nuria the closest
of the five?

402
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,375
TROI: Mm-mm.

403
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:30,000
Negative.

404
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,875
DATA: Is Nuria
the one in motion?

405
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,583
(<i> clears throat</i> )
Mm-hmm.

406
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,208
Lock sensors on Nuria.

407
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,625
Locked on.

408
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,750
We can beam Nuria
aboard at will.

409
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,625
Data, when sensors
indicate that she's alone,

410
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,542
beam her directly to
Transporter Room One.

411
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:45,250
Aye, sir.

412
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,709
Ensign Hoy.

413
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,291
DATA:
Captain, Nuria is alone.

414
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,125
I'll handle this.

415
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:17,875
Nuria.

416
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:20,125
Don't be afraid.

417
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,041
No one is going to harm you.

418
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,417
Who...?

419
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,709
I am Jean-Luc...

420
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,542
Picard.

421
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:35,375
(<i> gasps</i> )

422
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:42,375
Please, get up.

423
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:45,542
Get up. You must
not kneel to me.

424
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:46,834
You do not wish it?

425
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,583
I do not deserve it.

426
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:56,875
Look at me.

427
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:59,125
Look at me.

428
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:08,542
Feel the warmth
of my hand.

429
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,000
The rhythm of my pulse.

430
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:18,792
I'm not a supreme being.

431
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:21,500
I'm flesh and blood,
like you.

432
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:22,709
Not like me--

433
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,875
Like you.

434
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:25,583
Different in appearance, yes.

435
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,458
But we are both
living beings.

436
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,041
We are born, we grow,
we live...

437
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,667
and we die.

438
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:37,291
In all the ways that
matter, we are alike.

439
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:40,041
But you are the Picard.

440
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,667
There is something
I want you to see.

441
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,125
(<i> gasps</i> )

442
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,709
Oh, what a wondrous place.

443
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,291
Even the walls
obey your command.

444
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,959
Wondrous, yes,
but not miraculous.

445
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,750
The... doors...
merely work differently

446
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,250
from the ones you know.

447
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:09,208
(<i> gasps</i> )

448
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:19,208
That is my home?

449
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:23,250
Seen from far, far above.

450
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,625
Yet we do not fall.

451
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:37,583
I never imagined I would see
the clouds from the other side.

452
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:43,500
Your powers are
truly boundless.

453
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,000
Nuria...

454
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,375
Your people
live in huts.

455
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,000
Was it always so?

456
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:06,458
No.

457
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,750
We have found remnants
of tools in caves.

458
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:12,834
Our ancestors must
have lived there.

459
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,709
So, why do you
now live in huts?

460
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,709
Huts are better.

461
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,667
Caves are dark and wet.

462
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:21,875
So, if huts are better,
why did you once live in caves?

463
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,625
The most reasonable
explanation would be

464
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:30,667
that at one time, we did not
know how to make huts.

465
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:32,792
Just as at one time,

466
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:36,834
you did not know
how to weave cloth,

467
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:39,291
how to make a bow.

468
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,083
That would be
reasonable.

469
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,750
Someone invented a hut.

470
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:48,000
Someone invented a bow,
who taught others,

471
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,709
who taught their children,

472
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,375
who built a stronger hut,
who built a better bow,

473
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:55,417
who taught
their children.

474
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:03,792
Now, Nuria, suppose one of
your cave-dwelling ancestors

475
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,667
were to see you as
you are today.

476
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:09,583
What would she think?

477
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:12,083
I don't know.

478
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:15,458
Well, put yourself
in her place.

479
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,542
You see, she cannot kill a
hornbuck at a great distance.

480
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:22,041
You can.
You have a power she lacks.

481
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,750
Only because I have a bow.

482
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:25,583
She has never
seen a bow.

483
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:29,250
It doesn't exist
in her world.

484
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:31,250
To you,
it's a simple tool.

485
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:35,208
To her... it's magic.

486
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,250
I suppose she might think so.

487
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,000
Now, how would she
react to you?

488
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,208
I think she would fear me.

489
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,667
Just as you fear me.

490
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:57,166
I do not fear you any longer.

491
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,750
Good.
That's good.

492
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:03,375
You see...

493
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:07,083
my people once
lived in caves.

494
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,750
And we then learned
to build huts,

495
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:13,583
and in time, to build
ships like this one.

496
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,291
Perhaps one day, my people
will travel above the skies.

497
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:38,750
Of that, I have absolutely
no doubt.

498
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,041
(<i> thunderclap</i> )

499
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,750
It's not the season
for lightning.

500
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:46,917
It must be a warning.

501
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:49,792
We've had storms
like this before.

502
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:52,208
(<i> thunderclap</i> )

503
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,458
Not like this one.

504
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,542
It must mean
something.

505
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,667
The Picard is
angry with us.

506
00:33:57,709 --> 00:34:00,250
He blames us for
letting Palmer escape.

507
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:02,750
Liko, we don't know

508
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,709
that the overseer
is responsible

509
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,041
for this storm.

510
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,750
LIKO:
Will he also send floods?

511
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:10,834
My wife died in
last year's floods.

512
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,792
Will we all die now?

513
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,417
(<i> thunderclap</i> )

514
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,542
We must find Nuria.

515
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:31,875
Picard, you've
shown me wonders

516
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:34,417
I could never
have imagined.

517
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:37,458
And I am grateful to you
beyond words.

518
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:44,834
Might I request
something for my people?

519
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,417
You are indeed a leader.

520
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:52,709
You've shown me
such generosity.

521
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,667
I wish my people
could share in it.

522
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:01,542
Six Mintakans died in
a flood last winter.

523
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:03,792
Four of them, children.

524
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:06,417
Would you bring them
back to life?

525
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:09,375
That is not in my power.

526
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,166
Why?

527
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:14,583
You restored Liko's life.

528
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:18,291
Did the six who were killed
offend you in some way?

529
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,375
Did I offend you?

530
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:24,333
Should I have ordered
the death of Troi?

531
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:27,583
Please, you must tell me

532
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,291
if there's anything I can
do to change your mind.

533
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,792
I've failed to get through
to you, haven't I?

534
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:36,375
Despite all my efforts.

535
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:43,417
(<i> thunderclap</i> )

536
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:50,542
Nuria can't be found.

537
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,000
No one knows
where she's gone.

538
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:55,333
Hali, any sign of
Palmer or Riker?

539
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,959
They have escaped us.
We searched everywhere.

540
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,166
(<i> thunderclap</i> )

541
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,750
What do we do now, Father?

542
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,333
We must do as
the Picard wishes.

543
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,375
Punish those
responsible.

544
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:14,291
Nuria would not
allow us to do that--

545
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,959
Nuria isn't here.

546
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,959
We can't wait.

547
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,625
(<i> gasping</i> )

548
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,333
Crusher to Picard.

549
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,250
I think we're going
to lose Warren.

550
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,166
PICARD:
On my way.

551
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,291
I'm here, Mary.

552
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,750
(<i> gasping</i> )

553
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,792
BEVERLY:
Prepare two C.C.s of norep.

554
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,667
I'm sorry.

555
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:10,041
Picard, you could
not save her?

556
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,667
No.

557
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,875
You<i> do</i> have limits.

558
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:18,125
You are not masters
of life and death.

559
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:21,542
No, we're not.

560
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:24,333
We can cure
many diseases.

561
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:28,375
We can repair injuries.
We can even extend life.

562
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:34,542
But for all our knowledge,
all our advances,

563
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:38,125
we are just as
mortal as you are.

564
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:43,458
We are just as powerless
to prevent the inevitable.

565
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:49,625
You are a remarkable people,

566
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,792
but you are not
superior beings.

567
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:56,291
My people must be made
to understand that.

568
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:02,875
Liko, you don't want
to kill me.

569
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:04,166
I have no choice.

570
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,041
I must do as
the Picard wishes.

571
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:09,667
Are you sure you know
what he wants?

572
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:11,041
That's the problem

573
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:14,291
with believing in a
supernatural being--

574
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:17,667
trying to determine
what he wants.

575
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,208
We must do something.

576
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,291
But what if it's the
wrong thing, Father?

577
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:35,917
Picard, we need your guidance.

578
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,625
Is it your wish

579
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,166
that this woman
should die?

580
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:43,750
Answer us.

581
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:45,125
Speak.

582
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,625
Liko.

583
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:50,458
The Picard!

584
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,625
The overseer
has come.

585
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:55,250
No, Liko.

586
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:57,125
Liko, I am a man.

587
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:59,125
I am not the overseer.

588
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:03,208
I am a traveller
from a faraway land.

589
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,291
Nothing more.

590
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,333
But you have
restored my life.

591
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:09,500
I am your servant.

592
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:11,625
You are nobody's
servant, Liko.

593
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:14,875
I neither desire your
obedience nor your worship.

594
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:16,959
Picard speaks the truth.

595
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,834
I have visited his people.
I have seen

596
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,667
how they live
and how they die.

597
00:40:22,709 --> 00:40:25,291
When death takes one
of<i> their</i> loved ones,

598
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,250
they are as helpless
as we are.

599
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:31,834
Then... how was I
brought back to life?

600
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:34,166
Liko, you were not dead.

601
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:37,083
Picard's people have
a knowledge that we lack.

602
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:39,542
They are able to heal
wounds that we cannot.

603
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:43,333
No, no, he<i> can</i> bring
back the dead.

604
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,041
Show them, Picard.

605
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:48,208
You can bring back
my wife to me.

606
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,250
I cannot.

607
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,041
Why?

608
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,417
Why won't you do this for me?

609
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,125
Have I failed you
in some way?

610
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:58,625
Are you angry with me?
I'm not angry with you.

611
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:01,458
Well, then I beg you,
bring her back to me.

612
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,625
I will give you my life
in exchange.

613
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:05,959
Please!

614
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,667
Take back what
you gave me.

615
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:09,834
Give it to her.
Let her live.

616
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,375
It is beyond my power.

617
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:13,375
Nothing is beyond
your power.

618
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:16,667
You are the overseer.
I will prove it.

619
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,083
Liko!

620
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,542
If you believe
I am all-powerful,

621
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,709
then you cannot hurt me.

622
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:33,125
If, however, I am
telling the truth...

623
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:37,000
and I am mortal...

624
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,709
you will kill me.

625
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:45,458
But if the only proof you
will believe is my death...

626
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,875
then shoot.

627
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:48,500
Liko, don't do it!

628
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:49,792
Father, no!

629
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:08,083

Now, Mr. La Forge.

637
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,875
LA FORGE: Aye, sir.

638
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,709
What is that?

639
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,709
It is a place where we
can watch your people.

640
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,333
But why?

641
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:46,041
To study you,
to understand your ways.

642
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:48,125
Discontinue, Mr. La Forge.

643
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,041
Picard, why would a
people so advanced

644
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:57,458
want to learn about us?

645
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,625
We were once
as you are now.

646
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:03,542
To study<i> you</i> is to
understand<i> ourselves.</i>

647
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:06,291
But why do you have to
hide yourself from us?

648
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,667
Because their presence
would affect us

649
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:12,750
just as it
affected<i> me.</i>

650
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:14,500
It is our highest law,

651
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:16,709
that we shall not interfere
with other cultures.

652
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,375
Then revealing yourselves
was an accident.

653
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:21,583
Oh, yes.

654
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,583
And now,
we must leave you.

655
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:26,250
Why? There's so much
you can teach us.

656
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:30,375
But that, too,
would be interference.

657
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:34,667
You must progress
in your own way.

658
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,208
So, we will.

659
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,458
You have taught us there is
nothing beyond our reach.

660
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,834
Not even the stars.

661
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,625
Paki?

662
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,500
I wish you good
journeys, Picard.

663
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:08,583
Remember my people.

664
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:12,834
Always.
