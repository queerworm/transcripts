<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43957.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:08,291
<i>We are charting</i>
<i>an unexplored star system</i>

3
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,208
<i>within the Zeta Gelis Cluster.</i>

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,083
<i>This routine assignment</i>
<i>has made</i>

5
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:17,125
<i>for a refreshingly quiet time</i>
<i>aboard the</i> Enterprise.

6
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,750
That's her.

7
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,500
WORF:
Which one?

8
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:22,917
LA FORGE:
The one on the right.

9
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:25,500
Don't stare.

10
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:26,667
Why not?

11
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,291
Because she'll see.

12
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,750
Good.

13
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:34,667
You must let her see
the fire in your eyes.

14
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,875
But what would I say?

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,417
Words come later.

16
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:47,959
It is the scent
that first speaks of love.

17
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:53,041
Thanks, Worf.
That helps a lot.

18
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,208
Hi, Geordi.

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,834
(<i> clears throat</i> )

20
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,291
Hi.

21
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,667
So, how have you been?

22
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:11,625
Good, uh...

23
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

24
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,208
How are things
down in Engineering?

25
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,166
Fine, they...

26
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:20,542
(<i> growls softly</i> )

27
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,709
They-- they've been fine.

28
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,792
Well, I'll see you around.

29
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,375
(<i> sighs</i> )

30
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:34,625
I have much to teach you
about women.

31
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:38,041
RIKER:
Mr. La Forge, report
to Transporter Room Three.

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,000
What's this all
about, Commander?

33
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,792
Sensors have discovered
a small one-man spaceship

34
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,041
crashed on the planet.

35
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,417
We've picked up
life-signs--

36
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,875
humanoid, very faint and fading.

37
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,041
Radiation levels
within acceptable limits.

38
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,041
LA FORGE:
We can beam him out
from under there.

39
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,291
Get him right up
to Sick Bay.

40
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,709
He's not stable enough
for transport.

41
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,583
There's damage
to his brain stem.

42
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,166
Autonomic functions are failing.

43
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,208
His heart needs
active neural feedback.

44
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,291
It can't regulate itself.

45
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,709
I need a volunteer.

46
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,208
Right here.

47
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,834
I'm going to hook up
your nervous systems

48
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,542
through the tricorder.

49
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,041
Your brain will
regulate both systems.

50
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,625
That should stabilize
him long enough

51
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,875
to get him
up to the ship.

52
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:58,333
Take deep, regular breaths.

53
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,542
If anything goes wrong,

54
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,917
I'll break
the connection.

55
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,208
Okay.

56
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,500
(<i> gasps</i> )

57
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:09,750
Geordi.

58
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:12,250
I'm fine. No problem.

59
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,959
Transporter Room, three to
beam directly to Sick Bay.

60
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:53,417
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

61
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:57,417
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

62
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,250
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

63
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,875
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

64
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:07,417
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

65
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:12,166
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

66
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,750
Autonomic responses
are still low.

67
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,291
Begin cardiostimulation.

68
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,667
60 cc's of inaprovaline.

69
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,583
Massive infection is setting in.

70
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,542
Use the protodynoplaser
to stabilize his immune system.

71
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,417
We need to design a virus

72
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,041
that can infiltrate
his cell structure

73
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,667
and boost his ATP production.

74
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,041
NURSE TEMPLE:
What about Commander La Forge?

75
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,625
He's waiting
in the diagnostic center.

76
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,208
I need you to give him
a full bio-scan.

77
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,709
See if there's
any residual effect

78
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,917
from that energy discharge
during the neurolink.

79
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,834
Keep his arm
in cryogenic stasis

80
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,542
until the vital signs
are strong enough

81
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,709
for surgical procedures.

82
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,667
From the size and shape
of the wreckage,

83
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:05,834
it appeared to be
some kind of an escape pod.

84
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,625
Their control system
was badly damaged,

85
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,375
which is probably
what caused the crash.

86
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:10,709
An escape pod?

87
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,500
Then he couldn't
have traveled very far.

88
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:15,417
Mr. Data, are there any other
signs of ships in the area?

89
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,250
I am picking up
a scattering of debris

90
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,625
in extended orbit
around the planet.

91
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:23,458
It reads as refined metals
and other synthetic compounds.

92
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,208
The remains of
a larger vessel.

93
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,583
He must have
left in the pod

94
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,583
before the ship
was destroyed.

95
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,417
Sensors show trace elements
in the debris

96
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,250
that would indicate phaser fire
was recently exchanged.

97
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,291
Were you able to
salvage anything else

98
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,750
from the escape pod?
This is all that was left

99
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:38,500
from their
computer system.

100
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,291
Mr. Data,
can you access it?

101
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,041
It will take time, sir.

102
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,500
Downloading this into our system

103
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:45,917
will require fabrication
of a matrix translator

104
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,834
to emulate
the alien's computer system.

105
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,500
Keep me apprised
of your progress.

106
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,083
Aye, sir.

107
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,542
Limb re-fusion appears
to be successful, Doctor.

108
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,291
Tissue oxygenation
is within norms.

109
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,959
Hmm. That's all
we can do for now.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,250
We won't be
able to test

111
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,125
neuromuscular function
for a few days.

112
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,333
(<i> door opens</i> )

113
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,875
Ah, Geordi.

114
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,667
Can I go now, Doc?

115
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:31,375
No need to keep you here,
your bio-scan

116
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,542
came out negative.

117
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,750
Could have told you that.

118
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,750
I feel great.

119
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,750
How's your patient?

120
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

121
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,583
I never thought
he'd make it this far.

122
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,500
There was major trauma to
his head and chest cavity,

123
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:51,792
massive plasma loss and severe
damage to most of his organs.

124
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,250
What are his chances?

125
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,000
I believe he's
going to live.

126
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,667
I'm afraid I can't take
the credit for it, though.

127
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:03,208
His body seems to have
amazing recuperative powers.

128
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,583
The damaged tissue seems
to be repairing itself

129
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,834
at a phenomenal rate.

130
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,000
There's one thing
that troubles me, though.

131
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,875
What's that?

132
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:16,208
Take a look at this.

133
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,125
Cell regeneration.

134
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes.

135
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:27,375
The thing is, it has nothing
to do with the injuries.

136
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:30,959
These are undamaged cells
that seem to be mutating.

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,917
Do you have a theory
as to the cause?

138
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,834
No, I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

139
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,291
There is a possibility

140
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,500
that it's part of his
natural healing process.

141
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,083
I hope it is,

142
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,709
because there's nothing
I can do to stop it.

143
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,500
I'm telling you, Data,
there's got to be some way

144
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,500
to decode the information
in this thing.

145
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:55,458
I agree, Geordi, but the data
matrix within the capsule

146
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,834
does not correspond
to any standard format.

147
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,583
All we have been
able to determine

148
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,250
is that the device contains
a chemically-based system

149
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,750
for molecular energy encoding.

150
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,625
Yeah, and the computer
still can't analyze

151
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,750
the specific chemical
elements involved.

152
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:10,291
It's gotta be part of the
data processing system.

153
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:15,083
What if... it's a feedback
loop controller?

154
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,041
The compact shape does suggest

155
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,250
a rapid chemical processing
and storage capacity.

156
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,750
We found it
near the escape pod's

157
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,458
instrumentation assemblage.

158
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,417
This capsule might process
the ship's dynamic motions

159
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,542
and augment its manual
control inputs.

160
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,417
You know, we could
send it a few test signals.

161
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,917
Make it think
the entire assemblage

162
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,041
was awake and operating.

163
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,542
An intriguing experiment.

164
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,417
The capsule might provide us
with information

165
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,667
without the need to decode
the storage medium itself.

166
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,000
Perhaps we should examine
your theory immediately.

167
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,542
WORF:
Less talk.

168
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,917
More synthehol.

169
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,834
We came here to relax.

170
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,333
I am relaxed.

171
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,750
In fact, I've never felt better.

172
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,834
But you know, Worf,
you're right.

173
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,625
The storage capsule
can wait awhile.

174
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,458
See you, Patti.

175
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,959
Christy, you're not
leaving, are you?

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,333
I was just on my way
down to the arboretum.

177
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:24,250
Mmm, would you care
for some company?

178
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,750
I'd love some,
but I didn't think

179
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,667
you were interested
in that kind of thing.

180
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,125
Mmm, there are a
lot of things

181
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,625
that you don't
know about me.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,667
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

183
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:41,333
I've been tutoring him.

184
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,709
He learns very quickly.

185
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:50,542
CRUSHER:
<i>Medical Log, Stardate 43958.8.</i>

186
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,500
<i>I have removed patient</i>
<i>"John Doe"</i>

187
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:56,375
<i>from the emergency</i>
<i>bio-support unit.</i>

188
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:59,375
<i>In just 36 hours, most of</i>
<i>his major organ systems</i>

189
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,166
<i>have regenerated themselves</i>

190
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,625
<i>to the point where they can</i>
<i>now function on their own.</i>

191
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,125
(<i> gasps</i> )

192
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

193
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,625
I am... alive.

194
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,000
You certainly are.

195
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,166
Thank you for my life.

196
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:40,250
Tell me...

197
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,792
who am I?

198
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:52,542
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43960.6.</i>

199
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,125
<i>Our mission to map</i>
<i>the Zeta Gelis Star Cluster</i>

200
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,041
<i>is proceeding on schedule.</i>

201
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,959
<i>Meanwhile, Dr. Crusher reports</i>

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,166
<i>that the recovery of the</i>
<i>patient she has named John Doe</i>

203
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,375
<i>continues at a remarkable pace.</i>

204
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:14,250
Are you experiencing
any discomfort?

205
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,542
None.

206
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,250
I can feel the life
returning to my body.

207
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,000
Your neurofibrowaves

208
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,291
are functioning
almost normally again.

209
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,959
That puts you about six weeks
ahead of my original schedule.

210
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,834
That should give you
and your colleagues

211
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,166
something to talk about.

212
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,959
You are all
we've talked about

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,208
since your arrival.

214
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,750
I believe I'm ready for the
next phase of my treatment.

215
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,709
You are right.
It is about time

216
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,375
you stopped taking up
valuable bed space.

217
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:48,750
Now, these motor-assist
bands will provide you

218
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:52,875
with electrical stimulation
for your arms and legs.

219
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,333
They will help you
to relearn

220
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,417
how to control
your muscles again.

221
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,917
But remember, you've been off
your feet for almost a month.

222
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,875
So, don't be disappointed

223
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:04,250
if at first your mobility
is restricted.

224
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,709
Your limbs are still weak.

225
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,667
I appreciate your
concern, Doctor,

226
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:13,208
but I think I may
surprise you again.

227
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,959
I feel strong enough to fly.

228
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,125
Whoa.

229
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,625
Perhaps I should concentrate
on walking first.

230
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:35,542
Let's try it again, but a
little more slowly this time.

231
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,583
Much more slowly.

232
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,917
I envy your
reflexes, Captain.

233
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,959
I envy your strength of will.

234
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,417
Dr. Crusher has been keeping me
informed of your progress.

235
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,709
It's really quite extraordinary.

236
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,000
I have an
extraordinary doctor.

237
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,208
Oh...

238
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,458
She gave me
back my life.

239
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,792
I hope that I am worthy
of her efforts.

240
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Are you still unable to recall
anything about your past?

241
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:42,291
Unfortunately,
Captain,

242
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:46,291
my memories begin the moment
I woke up in Sick Bay.

243
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,542
Dr. Crusher told me you think
I was in some kind of battle.

244
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,792
PICARD: We're quite
sure of that.

245
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,083
Have you any idea

246
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,291
how you came to be
in that escape pod,

247
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,458
or what happened
to the ship?

248
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,750
No.

249
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,041
Believe me, Captain,
it's a horrible feeling

250
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,291
not knowing who you are,
where you're from.

251
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,291
Have you tried
synaptic induction?

252
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,250
His neural nets don't conform
to any known patterns.

253
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:16,125
Conventional neurotherapy
has proven ineffective.

254
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,250
Hopefully, in time,
his memory pathways

255
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,041
will reestablish
themselves naturally.

256
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,041
That same pain?

257
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,291
Yes.

258
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,417
I think I've made
enough progress for one day.

259
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,000
Not a relapse, I hope.

260
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,750
This has nothing to do
with his previous wounds.

261
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:38,417
I think this has
something to do

262
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,792
with the continuing mutation
of his cell structure.

263
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,792
And you still have no theory
as to what's causing it?

264
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:44,834
It doesn't make any sense.

265
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,542
I seem to be
a mystery, Doctor.

266
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,417
To you...

267
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,375
and to myself.

268
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:01,917
(<i> clears throat</i> )

269
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,750
Well, this is where I get off.

270
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,333
See you tonight
in Ten-Forward?

271
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,709
Yeah, I'll be there.

272
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,291
Hello, Commander.

273
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,959
Miss Henshaw.

274
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,083
Bridge.

275
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,458
Deck six.

276
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,458
So, you and Miss Henshaw

277
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,750
have been seeing
a lot of each other.

278
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,667
Every night this week.
Is that all?

279
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,083
I thought you'd been walking
around with that smile

280
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,792
on your face a lot
longer than that.

281
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:33,792
Well, I guess I have.
This whole last month or so,

282
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:35,750
everything seems
to be going my way.

283
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:37,083
I don't know what it is,
but something

284
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,500
sure has
changed around here.

285
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,291
The only thing
that's changed is you.

286
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,208
Me?

287
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm the same old
guy I always was.

288
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,500
If you say so.

289
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,041
I don't remember
the old Geordi having

290
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,458
that much success with
Miss Christy Henshaw.

291
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,917
(<i> chuckles</i> )

292
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,291
Well, maybe I am
a little bit more confident

293
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,750
than I used to be.

294
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,333
What happened to you?

295
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,417
I was kayaking in
the holodeck again.

296
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,792
You dislocated
your shoulder.

297
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:24,417
Sit down, I'll get the
osteotractor frame.

298
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,750
Hi, Mom.

299
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,000
We still on
for dinner tonight?

300
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,250
7:30 sharp.
I'll be right back.

301
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,834
(<i> whimpers in pain</i> )

302
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,500
Kayaking again?

303
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:35,208
Yeah.

304
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,041
How's my mom's
favorite patient?

305
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,834
Judge for yourself.

306
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,709
Not bad.

307
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,750
Your mom promised me
a tour of the ship tomorrow.

308
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:50,083
You may find this hard
to believe, but Sick Bay

309
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,834
can be an incredibly
boring place to be.

310
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,125
O'BRIEN:
Hey, Doc!

311
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,125
I'm dying out here.

312
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:04,709
Don't worry, my friend.
You'll be all right.

313
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,542
The pain's gone.

314
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,500
It's completely healed.

315
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:22,041
I don't understand.

316
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,166
What did you do?

317
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,125
I don't know.

318
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,875
It was instinct.
I just touched him.

319
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:43,917
I've run every test and scan
on him that I can think of.

320
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,709
And yet, there's
no physiological evidence

321
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,625
to indicate that he would
possess such powers.

322
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:54,083
But then, there's so much
about John that's a mystery.

323
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,250
You know,
I really like him.

324
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,083
He does have a certain charm,
doesn't he?

325
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:03,375
The entire medical staff
has commented on it.

326
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:07,041
You seem a little taken
with him yourself.

327
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:11,959
He has a strength and serenity
that I find very attractive.

328
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,667
And yet,
he's vulnerable.

329
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:18,834
I guess I find him...
intriguing.

330
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,959
Seems like there's a little
more to it than that.

331
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,834
Is this your way of asking me

332
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,000
if I'm getting
romantically involved with him?

333
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,291
You said it, I didn't.

334
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:34,083
My feelings towards him
aren't romantic...

335
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,834
exactly.

336
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,792
I mean, I know that
the doctor-patient relationship

337
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:42,208
can sometimes create
a false sense of intimacy,

338
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,041
but this... is different.

339
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:51,625
There's an almost
spiritual connection.

340
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,333
(<i> sighs</i> )
I guess I'm not making

341
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,166
any sense, am I?

342
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,333
I think I understand.

343
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:12,000
Data, I was thinking about
the storage capsule last night,

344
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,959
and I was wondering.

345
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,625
What if we've been going
about this thing the wrong way?

346
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:19,500
We've been trying to analyze
its mechanical properties.

347
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:22,000
What if it's a biochemical
storage medium?

348
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,834
Are you suggesting
that it employs

349
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,000
memory RNA, like
an organic cell?

350
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,792
Well, it<i> does</i> contain
quantities of nucleic acids.

351
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,250
Perhaps the information
sequences are encoded

352
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,000
in the molecular
patterns themselves.

353
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,875
Computer, scan
the storage capsule.

354
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:39,625
Analyze molecular sequences
on nucleic acid chains.

355
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,041
Well, what do you know?
A navigational chart.

356
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,041
It appears that your hypothesis
was correct, Geordi.

357
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,166
I knew it.
Captain!

358
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,542
You found something?

359
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,208
We've determined that
the storage capsule

360
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,583
from John Doe's
escape pod

361
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,875
contains navigational
information.

362
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,375
Can you match these stars
to our charts?

363
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:04,291
Computer, run transformational
matrix calculations.

364
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:08,667
Match navigational referents
to known stars in this sector.

365
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:11,417
COMPUTER: Information on
this sector is incomplete.

366
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,959
No correlation.

367
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,875
I'm not giving up yet,
not after coming so close

368
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,667
to cracking this thing.

369
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:20,667
You know, that might be
flight path information

370
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,291
from John's ship, but without
a frame of reference,

371
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,417
I can't determine
its origin points.

372
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,834
Computer, assume those paths
are course corrections

373
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,667
and derive
gravitational values

374
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:33,333
for stellar objects near
those flight paths.

375
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:39,458
Most of these are
ordinary G-type stars.

376
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,375
This would appear to be
a neutron star,

377
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,959
possibly a pulsar.

378
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,542
LA FORGE:
Which means that this

379
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,792
might be a rotational
time reference.

380
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:51,959
Computer, assume these symbols
are pulsars.

381
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,667
Translate associated values

382
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,750
into standard
temporal notations.

383
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:01,166
Computer, is there a pulsar
with a rotational period

384
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:05,208
of 1.5244 seconds
within sensor range?

385
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,709
COMPUTER:
Affirmative.

386
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,792
Bingo!
Now, Computer,

387
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:11,250
overlay navigational chart
using referenced pulsars

388
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,291
and project a flight path
back to its origin.

389
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,375
COMPUTER:
Flight path originated

390
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:20,625
at bearing 003, mark 015.

391
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,834
Distance, 2.3 parsecs.

392
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:24,875
That's it, Captain.

393
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,667
That's where John Doe
came from.

394
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:29,458
That bearing is almost directly
along our planned course, sir.

395
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,834
Good. Then, we can
continue our mission

396
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,875
without significant
interruption.

397
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,709
Home?
PICARD: Yes.

398
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,709
Using the information
we found in your escape pod,

399
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,792
we may be able to return
you to your people.

400
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,166
I cannot go back.

401
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,083
Why is that?

402
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,834
You must not take
me home, Captain.

403
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,166
CRUSHER:
John?

404
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,917
Your memory--
has it returned?

405
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:07,417
All I know is that
we came out here to escape.

406
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,375
Escape?

407
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:09,542
There were others with you?

408
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:12,041
Yes, I was not alone.

409
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:18,083
But what happened to the others,

410
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:22,000
or what we were escaping from,
I cannot remember.

411
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,375
But I do know
you must not take me back.

412
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,333
Not yet!

413
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,500
We'll not arrive
in your star system

414
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,333
for at least three weeks.

415
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,834
That will give us plenty of
time to discuss this further.

416
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,792
Hopefully, by then,
you will have regained

417
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:42,166
more of your memory.

418
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,375
You're right.
Of course, Captain.

419
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,625
I apologize for my outburst.

420
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,417
It's...

421
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,375
it's understandable.

422
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:57,417
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

423
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,458
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

424
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,083
(<i> gasps</i> )

425
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,458
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

426
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,750
This ship is astounding.

427
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:35,250
It seems to stretch on
without end.

428
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,750
We can see the rest
of it some other time.

429
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:39,375
This is your first day
out of Sick Bay,

430
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:43,542
and I don't want you
to overexert yourself.

431
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:47,000
This looks like
an ideal place to rest.

432
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:49,583
My thoughts exactly.

433
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,041
Truly remarkable.

434
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,959
What is?

435
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,875
These people.

436
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,417
They're all so different
from one another,

437
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,291
and yet, they work
together freely.

438
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,667
That surprises you?

439
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:17,625
It is... new to me.

440
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:23,166
My people are different somehow.

441
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:25,250
If only I could remember.

442
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,959
Yesterday...

443
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,041
for one... terrifying moment,
there was clarity.

444
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,625
You mean, the energy pulse?

445
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,250
Yes.
For that moment,

446
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:41,000
my purpose seemed clear.

447
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,625
And then it was gone.

448
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:52,458
The pain... the energy pulse...

449
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,625
must be linked to the cell
mutation in the body.

450
00:25:56,667 --> 00:26:00,250
Oh, I wish I could
help you find the truth.

451
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,417
Beverly, you've done
so much for me.

452
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:07,250
I only wish there was some way
I could repay you.

453
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,792
But you have.

454
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:13,125
The friendship we've developed
has made me very happy.

455
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:16,917
The rapport
that exists between us

456
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:20,000
also means a great deal to me.

457
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:23,875
But... I am on some
kind of a journey.

458
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,083
Whatever brought me here...

459
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:31,750
whatever is happening
to my body,

460
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,500
is all part of that journey.

461
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,041
And I must complete it...

462
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:43,458
before...
any other consideration.

463
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,917
(<i> console beeping</i> )

464
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:56,083
Sir, I am reading a vessel
on long-range scanners.

465
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,709
It is coming from Sector 9569.

466
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,417
What configuration?

467
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,917
Impossible to identify
at this distance.

468
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:06,625
However, it<i> is</i>
on an intercept course.

469
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:10,500
Captain, the ship is
traveling at warp 9.72.

470
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,500
Warp 9.72?

471
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,083
Time till intercept?

472
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:17,625
At present course and speed,
ten hours, 53 minutes.

473
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,208
Try and hail them, Mr. Worf.

474
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,709
No response, Captain.

475
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,500
Keep monitoring their approach.
Repeat the hail

476
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:27,625
every half an hour.
Aye, sir.

477
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:30,458
Whoever they are, they're
in a big hurry to get here.

478
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:47,500

(<i> labored breathing</i> )

481
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,417
I can't make it stop.

482
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:07,375
John, tell me, is it
worse than before?

483
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:08,959
Much worse.

484
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,417
Should I get something
for the pain?

485
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,542
No, the readings are
fluctuating too wildly.

486
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,041
Besides, it wouldn't
do any good.

487
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,375
His entire cell structure
is transforming.

488
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,041
I have to leave, Beverly.

489
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,000
John, where do
you have to go?

490
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:22,667
I must get off this ship.

491
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:25,542
That's impossible.
Not in your condition.

492
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,000
I must!

493
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,500
Security.

494
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:56,667
Okay, let's realign
the magnetic inducer

Leave the control booth
immediately!

500
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,083
John, listen to me.

501
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,000
You must come down.

502
00:29:58,041 --> 00:29:59,875
I'll try to help you.

503
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,667
Step away from
the controls.

504
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:19,291
Get back.
Please, stay away.

505
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,834
I have no wish to harm you,

506
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,333
but you must return
to Sick Bay immediately.

507
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:27,500
No. Do not come
any closer.

508
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:30,417
I cannot control what
is happening to me.

There's no trace of injury.

522
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,291
You admit you were trying
to steal a shuttlecraft.

JOHN:
Yes.

524
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:40,792
So, I ask you again, why?

525
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:41,959
I don't know.

526
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,417
Unacceptable.
You had a reason.

527
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,375
I want to know
what it was.

528
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:47,291
Damn it, you nearly killed
a member of my crew.

529
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,834
And healed him.
I'm not forgetting that.

530
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:51,166
That's the reason he's
here and not in the Brig.

531
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,375
I warned him.

532
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,000
Told him it was dangerous.

533
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:56,792
Why?
Why was it dangerous?

534
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,834
What is happening
to you?

535
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,625
I don't know.

536
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,625
The rate of metamorphosis
is accelerating.

537
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,417
It's almost as if
your body is generating

538
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,542
an electrical field that's
warping the tissue.

539
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:16,000
Who are you?
What are you?

540
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:19,125
I'm afraid...

541
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:23,208
for myself, for all of you.

542
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:26,542
I have to get away.

543
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,083
Isolate myself.

544
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:32,542
Whatever is happening to me,
it's dangerous.

545
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,709
As Lieutenant Worf discovered.

546
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,583
I don't want to hurt anyone.

547
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,625
Captain, for the sake
of your crew,

548
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,458
let me go
before this happens again.

549
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,500
John, I don't believe you're
capable of harming any--

550
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:48,625
DATA: Captain.
The alien vessel is coming

551
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,291
within weapon's range.
Its shields are up.

552
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,709
I'm on my way.

553
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,041
I want him kept under
constant surveillance.

554
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,583
John.

555
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,417
I really want
to thank you.

556
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,166
For what?

557
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,041
I don't know how,
or even why,

558
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,083
but down on the planet,
you gave me something--

559
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:15,041
a... well,
a new confidence.

560
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,083
I doubt I can take
credit for that.

561
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:21,917
Perhaps I only helped you
find something you already had.

562
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,917
DATA:
Captain, on screen.

563
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,750
Alien vessel approaching
at half-impulse, sir.

564
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:37,542
Heading 051, mark 114.

565
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,834
Raise shields.

566
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,709
Slow to one-third
impulse power.

567
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,500
Bring us to 103, mark 025.

568
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:46,834
Mr. Worf,
hail the alien vessel.

569
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:49,792
They continue
to ignore our hail, sir.

570
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:52,208
DATA:
They are scanning us, sir.

571
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,500
They are answering our hail,
Captain.

572
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,000
On screen.

573
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,709
JOHN:
Sunad.

574
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,458
You know him?

575
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,792
Yes.

576
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:12,709
I don't know how,
but... he's dangerous.

577
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,166
I am Commander
Sunad of Zalkon.

578
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:22,542
You are trespassing
into our space

579
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,917
and you are holding
a Zalkonian citizen.

580
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:26,333
I'm Captain
Jean-Luc Picard

581
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,125
of the United Federation
of Planets.

582
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,834
We do not intend
transgression of--

583
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:33,667
You will return him
to us immediately.

584
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:36,792
Sunad, this individual
is a guest aboard our ship.

585
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,333
We found him dying
in a shipwreck.

586
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:39,667
We have returned him to health.

587
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,625
Then you aided a criminal.

588
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,208
He is one of four
escaped prisoners.

589
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,792
We eliminated
the other three.

590
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:50,917
We thought this one
dead as well.

591
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:54,333
Return him
so we may complete our task.

592
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,917
Of what is he accused?

593
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:58,583
He is a disruptive
influence.

594
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,542
He spreads lies.

595
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,375
He encourages dissent.

596
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,458
He disturbs the natural order
of our society.

597
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,166
In what way?

598
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,291
That is not your concern!

599
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:12,208
I will give you
two hours to comply.

600
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,208
RIKER:
Tactical analysis.

601
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,875
The Zalkonian ship
has a formidable armament.

602
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:19,875
Their weaponry
is comparable to ours.

603
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,333
They're as fast
as the<i> Enterprise</i>

604
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:24,000
and probably just
as maneuverable.

605
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,250
Counselor, do they mean
to carry out their threat?

606
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,500
I believe so.

607
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:31,417
Sunad's hatred
for John was evident,

608
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:33,792
but there's
something else.

609
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:36,542
The Zalkonians
are afraid of John.

610
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,458
Commander Riker,
Counselor, Doctor.

611
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,166
John, I want you
to join us.

612
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,750
Mr. Data, you have the Bridge.
Mr. Worf, stay at Tactical.

613
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,500
Counter any moves
the Zalkonian makes.

614
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:46,959
WORF:
Aye, sir.

615
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:53,375
I can neither
confirm nor deny

616
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,875
what the Zalkonians
told you.

617
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:59,750
They make serious
accusations against you.

618
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:01,500
Their accusations
may be true.

619
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:04,208
I don't know.

620
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,750
I don't believe
that I am a criminal.

621
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,333
You understand the
difficult position

622
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,208
in which I am placed.

623
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,291
Completely.

624
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:16,375
And I refuse to place
your ship in danger.

625
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:22,125
If necessary, I will
surrender to them.

626
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,083
But I am convinced

627
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:29,208
there is more at stake
here than my life.

628
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,750
There's something...
important I must complete.

629
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,875
My survival is vital.

630
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,458
(<i> sighs</i> )
If I could explain it, I would.

631
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:54,083
I'll inform you of
my decision shortly.

632
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,792
Captain, you can't
seriously be considering--

633
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:07,166
We must consider all options,
Doctor, and not let

634
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,834
our personal feelings
impede our judgment.

635
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,166
You're going to
tell me it's irrelevant

636
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,792
that we'll be sending
him to his death?

637
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:15,000
Whether we approve of the
Zalkonians' intentions

638
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,583
is not the issue.

639
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:22,500
But for what it's worth,
I believe that John is correct,

640
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:25,667
that his existence
has broader ramifications

641
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:27,375
than that of a simple criminal.

642
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:29,250
TROI:
Sunad thinks so.

643
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,750
He feels personally
threatened by John.

644
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,166
Sunad called John a
"disruptive influence."

645
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,125
That's hardly a capital offense.

646
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,542
It's not up to us
to judge their laws, Doctor.

647
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,250
RIKER: I know how I would
feel if the situation

648
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,583
were reversed-- if they
were in our territory

649
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,542
holding a Federation citizen.

650
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,792
The Zalkonians truly
don't understand

651
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:49,667
our indecision
about returning John.

652
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:52,458
In their eyes, we shouldn't
even be involved.

653
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,875
But we<i> are</i> involved.

654
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:57,125
I saved his life.

655
00:37:57,166 --> 00:38:00,166
For what? So that they
could chase him down

656
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,291
and take away that life again?

657
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,417
Picard, we will not tolerate
more delays.

658
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:19,458
Commander,
let me remind you,

659
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,917
we are on a mission
of exploration.

660
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:24,417
Our purpose is to establish
peaceful relations

661
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:25,959
with the civilizations
we encounter.

662
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,667
We do not want
relations with you.

663
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:31,500
If that is your wish,
we will respect it.

664
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:34,667
We simply want you
to leave Zalkonian space

665
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:36,625
as soon as you return
the criminal.

666
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,792
Commander, we will leave.

667
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:40,709
It is not our policy
to intervene

668
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,834
in the affairs
of other cultures.

669
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:46,291
But before I return
the survivor to you,

670
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:49,500
I would appreciate a more
detailed explanation

671
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:52,083
of what he has done
to merit a death sentence.

672
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,208
As I said,
it is not your concern.

673
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,500
Agreed. However,
there are circumstances

674
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,667
of which you may be unaware.

675
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:02,333
The survivor has
suffered a memory loss.

676
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,083
He's therefore ill-equipped
to defend himself

677
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,542
against your accusations.

678
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:08,792
There<i> is</i> no defense.
Our judgment is final.

679
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:10,333
There's something else.

680
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:14,250
Since his recovery, he's
manifested unusual abilities.

681
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,667
What kind of abilities?

682
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:19,542
He apparently has the power
to heal injuries

683
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:20,917
with a simple touch.

684
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,083
Lies.

685
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:25,125
And even to reverse
death itself.

686
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,875
Obviously,
he has corrupted you as well.

687
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,834
I see I'm wasting my time.

688
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:33,917
(<i> gasping</i> )

689
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:42,500
(<i> all gasping</i> )

690
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,750
I can't breathe.

691
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:58,291
(<i> breathing deeply</i> )

692
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,917
It's come back to me, Beverly.

693
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:11,333
I know who I am...

694
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,333
what I am.

695
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,875
Ready all weapons.

696
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:55,500
You will no longer harm
these people, Sunad.

697
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:57,750
Fire upon that ship.

698
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,375
Do not be afraid.

699
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,625
I won't hurt you.

700
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:09,834
Kill him, Captain.
He's evil.

701
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:12,500
You could learn
from these people, Sunad.

702
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:13,792
They do not fear me.

703
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:15,834
They don't know how
dangerous you are--

704
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,917
you and the others
like you.

705
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,583
That is what you and
the other leaders

706
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,417
have maintained
for generations,

707
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,750
but it is not true.

708
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:25,875
Captain,

709
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,375
my species
is on the verge

710
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:29,333
of a wondrous
evolutionary change--

711
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:32,667
a transmutation beyond
our physical being.

712
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:37,625
I am the first of my kind
to approach this metamorphosis.

713
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,625
They tried to
convince us it was a sickness

714
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,709
we would never survive,
that the pain

715
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,417
and energy pulses
would kill us.

716
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:49,709
They claimed we were dangerous,
so they destroyed anyone

717
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,000
who exhibited the signs
of the transfiguration.

718
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,417
We were protecting our society.

719
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,458
By murdering us?

720
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,959
You saw the mutations
as a threat to your authority.

721
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You were terrified of something
you couldn't understand.

722
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:04,917
Some suspected that what
was happening to them

723
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,000
was not evil.

724
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,500
Four of us decided
to flee Zalkon

725
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:13,291
and let the metamorphosis
take its course.

726
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,125
You hunted us down,

727
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:20,000
killed the others,
but I survived...

728
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:23,875
with the help
of a kind...

729
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,125
and generous people.

730
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,875
(<i> voice resonating</i> ):
There is nothing to fear.

731
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:50,458
You can join me.
All Zalkonians can.

732
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,041
Let me show you.
Don't touch me!

733
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,583
As you wish.
But others will listen,

734
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,208
now that you can no longer
prevent me

735
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,917
from telling
them the truth.

736
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:02,375
Those who are willing
will follow me.

737
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:12,333
Sunad is back aboard
the Zalkonian vessel, Captain.

738
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,792
My people are about to
embark on a new realm--

739
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:31,875
a new plane of existence,
thanks to you.

740
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:35,375
It is our mission
to seek out life in all forms.

741
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:37,083
We are privileged
to have been present

742
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:39,333
at the emergence
of a new species.

743
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:43,750
Beverly,
you gave me life,

744
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:46,625
and more.

745
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:50,709
I do not have the words
for my gratitude...

746
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,333
nor my sorrow at leaving you.
