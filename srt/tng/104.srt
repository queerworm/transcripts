00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:12,083
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41235.25:</i>

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,834
<i>Our location, planet Ligon II,</i>

3
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:20,208
<i>source of a rare vaccine needed</i>
<i>on Federation planet Styris</i>
<i>IV.</i>

4
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:23,583
<i>Starfleet has instructed me</i>
<i>to engage in a friendly visit</i>

5
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,500
<i>and open treaty negotiations</i>

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,917
<i>to acquire</i>
<i>this medicinal substance.</i>

7
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:30,500
Standard orbit, sir.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,041
Lieutenant Yar calling
from Cargo Bay 1, sir.

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,333
Standing by to beam the Ligonian
welcoming party aboard.

10
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,583
On our way.

11
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,208
You have the helm, Mr. Data.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,458
Cargo 1.

13
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,500
This should be
an interesting experience.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,792
Agreed.

15
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:53,291
Not only are they
closely humanoid,

16
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,792
but their history has
remarkable similarities to ours.

17
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:57,709
A highly-
structured society,

18
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:59,750
and they're
exceedingly proud.

19
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:06,250
They've insisted
on using their own
transporter device, sir.

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,667
It's their way,
Lieutenant.

21
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,125
Do they have
our coordinates?

22
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,834
They have, sir,
precisely,

23
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:13,667
and they're standing by
for your signal.

24
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,166
This is
Captain Picard

25
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,333
aboard the Starfleet
vessel<i> Enterprise.</i>

26
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,583
Please do us the honor
of visiting our vessel.

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,709
I am Lutan.

28
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,125
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

29
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,750
Welcome aboard.

30
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:54,333
These are
my officers.

31
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,917
My second
in command,

32
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:57,291
Commander
William Riker...

33
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,625
ship's counselor,
Deanna Troi...

34
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,667
and my
security officer,

35
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,291
Lieutenant
Natasha Yar.

36
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,834
A woman?

37
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,834
Your chief
of security?

38
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:10,417
Yes, Lutan.
That is her
expertise.

39
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:13,542
I am honored to
meet your officers.

40
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:16,166
This is my secondary, Hagon.

41
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,333
A sample of the vaccine.

42
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,959
My duty, Lutan.

43
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,583
I'm sorry,
but I'm required
to inspect...

44
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,083
Out of my way, woman!

45
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,500
How interesting.

46
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,959
May we prove as surprising
to you.

47
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,208
(<i> chuckles</i> )

48
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,834
If I may suggest, sir...

49
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,166
no apology.

50
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,291
In their view,
it would weaken us.

51
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,667
Nothing concealed,
Captain.

52
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,125
Would you care
to accept it?

53
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,875
Unless you care to
examine it further.

54
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,208
Absolutely not.

55
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,250
This vaccine sample
is a gift of life,

56
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,333
and we are honored
at receiving it.

57
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,959
Would you do us
the additional honor now

58
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,750
of letting us
entertain you?

59
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,583
Yes, yes,
please prepare it.

60
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,417
We shall join you shortly.

61
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,834
I ask forgiveness.

62
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:26,375
They are strange
alien things.

63
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,667
You bear no fault.

64
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,709
But the female...

65
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,667
May be exactly
what I have needed.

66
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,667
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

67
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:02,250
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

68
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,750
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

69
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,875
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

70
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:12,625
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

71
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:16,834
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

72
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:31,041
Lutan, we are aware of many
of your planet's achievements

73
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,709
and its unique similarity

74
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:35,959
to an ancient Earth
culture we all admire.

75
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,959
On behalf of the
Federation, therefore

76
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,750
I would like to
present this token

77
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,166
of our gratitude
and friendship.

78
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,083
From China's
Sung Dynasty,

79
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,667
14th century.

80
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,875
13th century, sir.

81
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,834
Ah, yes, indeed.

82
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:54,709
A most thoughtful gift.

83
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,750
We are pleased.

84
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,583
We of Ligon
have been

85
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,500
apprehensive
about strangers.

86
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,667
We are not as technologically
advanced as you,

87
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:08,458
yet we possess
something you do not--

88
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:12,667
a vaccine which has been found
to be an effective antidote

89
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:16,041
against your dreaded
Anchilles fever.

90
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,291
If you respect
our customs

91
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,041
and we see
that respect,

92
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,750
we will be friends,

93
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,083
and we will make the antidote
available to all who need it.

94
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,583
If you require
respect from us,

95
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,625
I'm sure that
you will see it.

96
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,250
(<i> chuckles</i> )

97
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,583
Surrounded by
such friendship,

98
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,792
I feel no need
for my guards.

99
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,542
I will return shortly.

100
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:47,875
Prepare to transport me then.

101
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,959
PICARD:
If there is anything else,

102
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,709
any further
courtesy...

103
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:53,959
Would it be possible

104
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,625
to see one of your
wondrous holodecks?

105
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,792
We have heard how they are
used to train your officers.

106
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,500
And used for many
other things, too.

107
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,583
Commander Riker,

108
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,208
perhaps you and
Counselor Troi

109
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,417
would demonstrate.

110
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,625
Would it be possible

111
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:11,041
for Lieutenant Yar to do so,
Captain?

112
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,333
Some demonstration
of defense training?

113
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,750
We've noticed you're intrigued

114
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,959
with her having
security responsibilities.

115
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,792
But these things are not
at all unusual with us.

116
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:24,667
With us, it is the duty
of women only to own the land

117
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,750
and the duty of
men to protect...

118
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,208
and rule it.

119
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,625
Much the same has
happened

120
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,959
in human history, too.

121
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,417
I'd like to do it, sir...

122
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:38,417
as a sign of respect,
perhaps.

123
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,500
PICARD:
Very well.

124
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,750
This way, please.

125
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,458
Aikido, one.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,375
It won't move again
until my actions activate it.

127
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:19,000
You can create people
without a soul?

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,250
It's not a real
person, Lutan.

129
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,083
It has no life.

130
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,750
Everything it does is
controlled by computer.

131
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,667
Who am I?

132
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,583
Do you hear me?

133
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,291
But it will feel real
when it hits you.

134
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,500
A force like that
cannot possibly

135
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,417
come from an image,
Lutan.

136
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,458
Then you will
show me, Hagon.

137
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,792
(<i> chuckling</i> )

138
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,417
Thank you, Lieutenant.

139
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,375
How very enlightening.

140
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,291
Aikido, vanish.

141
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:42,417
I could create
two... even three,

142
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,542
but, really,
one is enough.

143
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,583
As you fight with it,
it learns, and before long

144
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,583
it knows exactly
how to defeat you.

145
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:53,125
Even the extraordinary
Lieutenant Yar?

146
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,959
It forces us to
keep improving.

147
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:02,125
Your skill...
impresses me.

148
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,625
I like you.

149
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,875
Farewell, my new friends
of the noble<i> Enterprise.</i>

150
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,417
Understanding has made friends
of many different people.

151
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,333
We've had a good
beginning, Lutan.

152
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:22,125
May I also extend a personal
farewell to Lieutenant Yar

153
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,959
in your Federation terms?

154
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,208
(<i> gasps</i> )

155
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,583
Picard to Bridge.
Red alert!

156
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:34,625
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

157
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,125
Shields up. Photon torpedoes
activated, sir.

158
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,166
What com contact
do we have with them?

159
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,250
With their orbital
control station, sir.

160
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,375
Make contact there
and on all hailing frequencies.

161
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:50,500
This is the<i> Enterprise</i> to Lutan
and the Ligonian government.

162
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,959
You have committed
an unfriendly act.

163
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,166
We insist that
you reply immediately.

164
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,917
Photon torpedoes ready, sir.

165
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,917
Set them for a display blast

166
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,208
a thousand meters short
of the planet surface.

167
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,417
Set.

168
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,166
Fire.

169
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,542
Do we know the source
of their transporter beam?

170
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,875
Our own transporter people
have tried to trace it, sir,

171
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,208
but to no effect.

172
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,375
It reads similar
to early Starfleet efforts

173
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,000
but uses the Heglenian shift

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,041
to convert energy and
matter in different...

175
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,709
which is actually not
important at this time.

176
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:33,333
This is Captain Picard
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

177
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,417
with a message to Lutan

178
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:38,291
whom I have so far
acknowledged as a friend.

179
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,959
But you have now committed

180
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,083
what our laws regard
as an attack upon us.

181
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,917
Since you have
visited our vessel,

182
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:47,333
you most certainly
know the power of it.

183
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,625
We insist that you reply
to this message.

184
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,542
Opinion, Counselor.

185
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:58,375
Will they injure Lieutenant Yar?

186
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,959
I believe not, sir.

187
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,709
They seem mainly curious.

188
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:04,208
In the case of Lutan, however

189
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,583
I did feel other needs.

190
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,125
What kind of needs?

191
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,917
Some sexual attraction
from all the males.

192
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,917
Lieutenant Yar is
physically very attractive.

193
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:18,500
But with Lutan,
I felt something else.

194
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,959
Something more like

195
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,667
avarice
or ambition.

196
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,709
Other comments?

197
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,041
If I may, sir?

198
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,333
One of the things about them
in the briefing studies

199
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,000
was their respect
for patience.

200
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,750
Strongly emphasized.

201
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,834
And you can see it
in the precise,

202
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:39,250
ritualistic way
they do things.

203
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,375
I'm worried about
Lieutenant Yar, too, sir.

204
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,667
But maybe we should sit
and wait them out.

205
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,875
PICARD:
<i>Stardate 41235.32:</i>

206
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,709
<i>I am concerned.</i>

207
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,917
<i>Over a full day of waiting</i>
<i>with no response from Lutan.</i>

208
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:59,208
<i>We are now testing</i>
<i>whether they are aware</i>

209
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,083
<i>of our sensors</i>
<i>probing them.</i>

210
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,041
<i>So far, we believe we have</i>
<i>pinpointed Lutan's</i>

211
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,583
<i>government compound.</i>

212
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,166
The vaccine, sir.

213
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,583
Yes, Doctor?

214
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,375
The vaccine.

215
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,458
I'm a physician--
I've seen death--

216
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,834
but not on the scale
this could mean.

217
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:20,333
You were testing if you
can replicate the vaccine.

218
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,834
And we can't.

219
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,959
The sample works fine
when used as an injection

220
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,834
but becomes unstable
when we try to replicate it.

221
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,458
You must get the vaccine
from the planet, Captain,

222
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,583
as much as you can,
immediately.

223
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,417
I'm aware of that, Doctor.

224
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:36,500
You've never had to watch
a patient die from this disease.

225
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,834
That's true.

226
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,792
But I have seen
my share of death.

227
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,625
(<i> sighs</i> )

228
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,834
Damn!

229
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,333
Where are the calluses

230
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,208
we doctors are supposed
to grow over our feelings?

231
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,542
Perhaps the good ones
never get them.

232
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,500
May I speak to you
about my son, Wesley?

233
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,959
What?

234
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,166
Oh. Yes.

235
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,667
All right.

236
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,291
He seems quite interested
in starship operations

237
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,291
and, speaking as
a mother, of course,

238
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,542
he seems
quite knowledgeable.

239
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,959
Well, yes...
speaking as a mother.

240
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,458
He's on the turbolift.

241
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,709
You'll remember you ordered him
to stay off of the Bridge.

242
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,542
Wesley.

243
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,917
I haven't
stepped one foot

244
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,542
on your Bridge, Captain.

245
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:48,041
All right, sir, I'll see
that he leaves immediately.

246
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,625
No.

247
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,000
No?

248
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,500
Why don't you sit at Ops

249
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,291
next to Lieutenant La Forge?

250
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,750
Sir?

251
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,000
Sir?

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,291
Is the whole ship deaf?

253
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,667
Sit down over there,
young man.

254
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,208
PICARD:
Temporarily.

255
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,750
Captain, we have
more information

256
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,166
from the briefing studies
on Ligon.

257
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,875
Oh, excuse me.

258
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,208
Dr. Crusher, some of
this may interest you.

259
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,250
Let's hear
the analysis.

260
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,041
It is a highly
structured society

261
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,792
in which people live by
strict codes of honor.

262
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,375
For example, what Lutan did

263
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,792
is similar to what certain
American Indians once did

264
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,875
called "counting coup."

265
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,458
That is from an obscure
language known as French.

266
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,583
DATA:
"Counting coup..."

267
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,959
Mr. Data,
the French language

268
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:47,625
for centuries on Earth
represented civilization.

269
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,750
Indeed?

270
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,917
But surely, sir...

271
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,750
I suggest you drop it,
Mr. Data.

272
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,750
Yes, sir.

273
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,083
"Counting coup" could be
something as simple as

274
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,792
touching an enemy
with a stick in battle

275
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:05,125
or taking something
from him and escaping.

276
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,625
It was considered
extremely heroic.

277
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,959
And under
these circumstances,

278
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,125
Lutan considers
himself heroic,

279
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,709
risking literally
everything

280
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:14,542
in the face of
our superior power.

281
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:18,417
And it fits Lutan's
personality profile as well.

282
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:21,625
He has an abnormally high
need for achievement.

283
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,875
Self-image to him
is a function

284
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,083
of what he<i> thinks</i>
he's achieved.

285
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,208
Those who set their
standards too high

286
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,333
can kill to meet them.

287
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,000
Why Tasha?

288
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,709
As a Starfleet
security officer,

289
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,250
she may have represented
his riskiest prize.

290
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,125
(<i> control buzzes</i> )
Transmission from
planet surface, sir.

291
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,291
DATA:
Main viewer on.

292
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,000
PICARD:
Well, Lutan, what do you want?

293
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,917
You will display
your image, please.

294
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,750
What is required
is an image

295
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,959
of Lieutenant Yar,
well and...

296
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,291
Are you making demands,
Captain?

297
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,083
Sir.

298
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,959
(<i> control beeps</i> )

299
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,458
According to the Ligon
code of honor,

300
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,000
Lutan has done
what he set out to do:

301
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,041
achieve recognition
for being daring and bold.

302
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,000
We've studied this
in some depth now, sir.

303
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,875
The proper thing
for you to do now

304
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,959
is to<i> ask</i> to
get Tasha back.

305
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,709
Ask for her?

306
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,583
Politely, Captain.

307
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,542
(<i> control beeps</i> )

308
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,500
And now, Lutan,

309
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
you have boldly taken
Lieutenant Yar from us,

310
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,500
and we ask that...

311
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,166
that you now
please return her.

312
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,333
Then come visit us,
Captain,

313
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,250
and we shall
return her to you.

314
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,417
Commander.

315
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:56,875
"Commander"?

316
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,583
That's quite formal.

317
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,750
So is this
request, sir.

318
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,792
We believe it
would be preferable

319
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,500
if the Captain led
this away party.

320
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,083
Agreed, sir.

321
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,834
Their customs concerning guests
make it much preferable.

322
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:15,041
And I'm very much
against that idea.

323
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,875
Lutan is clearly
a liar and devious.

324
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,500
Counselor Troi has admitted

325
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,333
that she believes
he's capable of killing.

326
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,375
It is my duty is to keep
the Captain from danger, sir.

327
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,875
Except that Ligonian custom
makes it clear

328
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,917
that a visiting leader
becomes an honored guest.

329
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,000
Not us.

330
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,709
Not second
in command.

331
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:34,375
Him.

332
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,333
And the custom requires

333
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,458
that Lutan should die
rather than violate that.

334
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,208
Yes, it seems reasonable,
put that way.

335
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,291
But I warn you,
if you get hurt,

336
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,458
I'll put you on report, Captain.

337
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:11,166
Welcome to my centerplace,
Captain Picard.

338
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,959
Consider yourselves
my honored guests.

339
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,709
Every hospitality
will be accorded you.

340
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:21,041
This is my first one:

341
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,166
Yareena.

342
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,834
PICARD:
Lutan is a fortunate man.

343
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:25,959
You've met Counselor Troi.

344
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,041
Yes. As on your vessel,

345
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,667
you have only to name whatever
courtesy we can provide.

346
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:34,458
Then, sir, the courtesy
of seeing Lieutenant Yar.

347
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,750
Lieutenant Yar will be
returned to you tonight

348
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,083
at a banquet I have arranged
in your honor.

349
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:43,959
I'd like to see her now.

350
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,458
Bring Lieutenant Yar.

351
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:48,917
I find it odd,
Captain,

352
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,542
that a man of
your experience

353
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,583
has such difficulty
in understanding

354
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,417
ordinary politeness.

355
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,959
Such as the politeness
of saying "please"

356
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,667
before abducting someone?

357
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,000
The expression "please" is used

358
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,917
only when requesting
the person back.

359
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:06,417
Yours<i> is</i> a different world.

360
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:11,250
With clear and simple ways
deeply rooted in our culture.

361
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,125
If you are
willing to...

362
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,542
ask for
Lieutenant Yar's return

363
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:18,875
tonight in front of all,

364
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,542
honor will be
satisfied.

365
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,625
One can see
the importance

366
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,375
of honor here, sir.

367
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,291
Honor is everything.

368
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,917
(<i> Yar grunting</i> )

369
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,625
Have you been treated
well, Lieutenant?

370
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,375
Fine, Captain.

371
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,166
But they're showing
some signs of wear.

372
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,917
There isn't any need
to be concerned, Captain.

373
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,625
She's been well cared for.

374
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,417
My ship's company
and I are certain

375
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,250
of<i> your</i> gentle
wisdom in that.

376
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,458
For a moment, I thought
I heard a threat implied.

377
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,458
But that would be
foolishness.

378
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,250
Something to be carefully
avoided, I agree.

379
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,083
The festivities for her return
to you are in preparation.

380
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,917
Shall we retire till then?

381
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,875
Until tonight, Lutan.

382
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,500
(<i> rhythmic tapping</i> )

383
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,959
Lutan, you have granted us
hospitality

384
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:48,083
and the safety
of your centerplace.

385
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,542
The gifts you give us are
rare and precious.

386
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,917
We thank you.

387
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,875
And now,

388
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:59,041
according to the customs
of your ancestors,

389
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,625
whom we honor
and respect,

390
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,333
I am here in peace

391
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,959
to ask for the return
of Lieutenant Yar.

392
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,834
Well-spoken.

393
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:14,083
There are those among my equals
in this gathering who were wary

394
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,333
of my approaching
the Federation.

395
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,625
I am proud
to have taken

396
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,917
this first step
toward a treaty

397
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:23,875
and proud that we have something
of great value to offer you.

398
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:28,458
A priceless,
life-giving vaccine.

399
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,583
The abduction I have done
according to our custom

400
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,625
for all to see.

401
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:38,500
Your conduct in this matter

402
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,250
has been beyond exemplary,
Captain Picard.

403
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,792
But now that
the moment has come...

404
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,750
I find that I cannot part
with her.

405
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,959
(<i> all gasp and murmur</i> )

406
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:52,291
You speak of a code of honor.

407
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,500
What you are saying now
according to our customs

408
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,125
is called an act of war.

409
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:00,834
This is not an act of war
but of love.

410
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:03,500
I want Lieutenant Yar
to become my first one.

411
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,041
I challenge your right
of supersedence!

412
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,542
No woman has challenged
supersedence for over 200 years.

413
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:11,083
The right is mine,
and I will have it.

414
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,625
Natasha Yar,
I challenge you.

415
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,166
A struggle to the death.

416
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,208
No!

417
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,875
The challenge is
unequivocally refused.

418
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:23,375
Then you shall have
no treaty, no vaccine,

419
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,375
and no Lieutenant Yar!

420
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:32,125
<i>Ship's Log,</i>
<i>First Officer Riker reporting:</i>

421
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,625
<i>We've been informed of the</i>

422
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,333
<i>and are maintaining combat</i>

423
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:41,166
<i>We are probing Lutan's compound</i>

424
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,834
<i>still unnoticed.</i>

425
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,917
Captain. Deanna.

426
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,583
Did you have any idea,
Lieutenant,

427
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,250
that Lutan was suddenly
going to announce

428
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,875
that he wanted you
for his first one?

429
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,583
No, sir.

430
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:05,333
Tell me what you
know about this.

431
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,291
Nothing, sir.

432
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,166
But it was a thrill.

433
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:14,000
Lutan is such...

434
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
such a basic
male image,

435
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,417
and having him say
he wants you...

436
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:22,542
Yes, of course it made me
feel good when he...

437
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,750
Troi, I'm your friend,
and you tricked me!

438
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,750
Only so you'd think about it,
completely and clearly.

439
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,375
We're all being
manipulated, Lieutenant.

440
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,041
Myself most of all.

441
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,834
How simple all this would be
without the Prime Directive.

442
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:46,291
That thought had passed
through my mind, Counselor.

443
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,500
What is this message
from Starbase 14?

444
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,208
It's showing the
infection rates--

445
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:01,250
percentage
illness increases.

446
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,458
Plague on Styris IV has
flared up out of control.

447
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,041
LA FORGE:
They're estimating deaths

448
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,125
in the millions, sir.

449
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:12,166
Captain Picard,
come in.

450
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,542
I know I can win--

451
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:17,000
not that I'd take
her life, of course--

452
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,458
but I'd be glad
to embarrass her.

453
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,792
The idea of accusing me
of taking...

454
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,625
The plague?

455
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,583
If anything, even worse
than we'd heard.

456
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:33,667
Which means they desperately
need the vaccine, sir.

457
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,375
And I know I can
win this challenge.

458
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:39,542
You have nothing to prove here,
Lieutenant.

459
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:42,583
But the vaccine is important
in this case, sir.

460
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,083
Counselor, you're the last
person I'd expect to argue

461
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,333
in favor of accepting
the challenge.

462
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:51,417
Betazoid blood is also
practical, Captain.

463
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:55,375
The odds are very good she'd
defeat Lutan's wife easily,

464
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:58,458
and you would win all the
bargaining points you need.

465
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,875
"The odds are..."

466
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,542
You have pointed
out yourself,

467
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,000
we are all at risk.

468
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,375
every day of
every mission.

469
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:10,500
I want some explanation
from Lutan.

470
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:18,333
Lutan, why are you obsessed
with this Lieutenant Yar?

471
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,750
Surely Yareena is
more desirable.

472
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,792
Certainly she can
offer you much more.

473
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,959
She owns many things,
many lands.

474
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,500
It's a great pity

475
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,083
you began by abducting
my security officer, Lutan,

476
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,458
because,
I should tell you,

477
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:38,083
I do admire
the hospitality

478
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,583
you offer here.

479
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,792
I am in the grip of forces
you do not understand.

480
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:44,625
Some of it
I do understand.

481
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:46,500
She's a rather
lovely female.

482
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,834
(<i> chuckles</i> )

483
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,417
You surprise me, Captain.

484
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:52,667
What do you know
of needs and feelings?

485
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:53,917
Nothing.

486
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:56,291
Well, almost nothing--

487
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:58,709
in my position
as ship's Captain.

488
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:00,250
(<i> chuckles</i> )

489
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,625
I see.

490
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,250
But it puzzles me.

491
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,834
If you feel like that
for Tasha,

492
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,792
why have you challenged her
to a fight to the death?

493
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,458
Not I; Yareena.

494
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:14,875
I am merely a spectator.

495
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:19,125
Ah, but you are also a man
of great importance and wealth.

496
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:21,750
Great importance, perhaps,
but he doe...

497
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,208
I see.

498
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:31,458
You too understand
the proper value of women.

499
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:35,417
We understand that they are
highly pleasant things

500
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:38,250
but, after all,
unimportant--

501
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,333
except for
the land they own.

502
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:44,917
You are a truly clever
person, Lutan.

503
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,375
You stand to
lose nothing

504
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,667
either way the
challenge goes.

505
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:54,834
A code of honor protects one,
Captain, like a magic cloak.

506
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:59,417
I will order
Lieutenant Yar to fight.

507
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:02,208
And may your cloak
bring you...

508
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,125
all you deserve.

509
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

510
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,709
Come in.

511
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,875
Why<i> that</i> razor, my friend?

512
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,875
Why not the one I adjusted
to perfect efficiency?

513
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,583
Shaving is a human
art form, Data.

514
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,583
Technological perfection
can shave too close.

515
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,583
Puzzling.

516
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,041
How can anything be
too efficient?

517
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:41,250
Thousands of things
are too efficient, Data,

518
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,583
at least for humans.

519
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,333
We always come back
to the human equation.

520
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,291
Exactly.

521
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:49,458
Have you continued
to work on it?

522
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:53,000
Constantly,
my friend...

523
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,458
particularly
the humor.

524
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,333
A man goes to a store
to buy some kidneys.

525
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:58,667
Oh, no...

526
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,166
He says
to the shopkeeper,

527
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,041
"I'd like a pound of
kiddillies, please."

528
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,834
The shopkeeper says, "You
mean kidneys, don't you?"

529
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:09,166
The man says, "I said
kiddillies, diddle I?"

530
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,959
It's too old,

531
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:14,125
and you didn't
tell it very well.

532
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:16,500
How do you know when
something is funny?

533
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,875
It's not explainable.

534
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,709
You... you just do.

535
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:22,041
Perhaps it is you,
Geordi.

536
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:24,083
Includle-ing
the kiddillies,

537
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:27,208
I've told 662 jokes,
and you've not...

538
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,333
"Includling
the kiddillies"!

539
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,875
Now, see, that's funny.

540
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,166
(<i> laughing</i> )

541
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,542
It was not meant
as a joke.

542
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:35,583
(<i> laughing harder</i> )

543
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,625
The tongue slipped.

544
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:40,375
Oh... oh boy.

545
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,291
(<i> over com</i> ):
Riker to Commander Data,
Lieutenant La Forge.

546
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:46,291
Report to the transporter room
for away-party duty.

547
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,166
First Officer to Captain.

548
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,792
Ready with the away personnel.

549
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:57,250
Lock in on
this location.

550
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,250
Transporter
locked in, sir.

551
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,834
Energize.

552
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:07,417
You've both seen
the message about
the plague?

553
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,959
And how badly the vaccine
is needed, yes, sir.

554
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,959
We need to know
as much as possible

555
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,917
about Ligonian armaments.

556
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,792
Data, especially
important is

557
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:17,709
an analysis of their
combat capabilities.

558
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:19,917
Geordi, concentrate
on their cutting edges

559
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:22,709
wherever applicable--
durability, composition,

560
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:24,041
weaknesses of material.

561
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,250
Aye, sir.

562
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,125
From any particular
point of view, sir?

563
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:31,125
From the perspective
of Lieutenant Yar

564
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:34,166
using them in combat
with Lutan's wife.

565
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,875
Most interesting.

566
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:41,083
Could this be
human joke number 663?

567
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,250
Negative, Data.

568
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,458
That's a Captain's order.

569
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:47,875
Which makes it
important to know

570
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,000
which of these weapons
are to be used.

571
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,041
And that won't be known
until combat begins.

572
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:58,542
You're right, Data.

573
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:01,667
It does sound
like a joke.

574
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,542
With the power
of the<i> Enterprise,</i>

575
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:05,500
we could overwhelm
this place easily,

576
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,583
just<i> take</i> what we want.

577
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,417
I may not understand
human humor, sir,

578
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:12,750
but I am a Starfleet
Academy graduate.

579
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,166
Which means,
of course...

580
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:17,000
Understanding
the Prime Directive, sir.

581
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,375
(<i> sighs</i> )

582
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,000
And that is, ironically,

583
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,291
what this is about.

584
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,834
By our standards,
the customs here,

585
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:25,917
their... code of honor

586
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:29,125
is the same kind of
pompous, strutting charades

587
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,417
that endangered our own species
a few centuries ago.

588
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:34,083
We evolved out of it
because no one tried

589
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,959
to impose
their own set of...

590
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,125
I'm sorry, this is
becoming a speech.

591
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,625
You are
the Captain, sir.

592
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:41,959
You're entitled.

593
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,375
Mm, not entitled

594
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:46,000
to ramble on about
something everyone knows.

595
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,667
Carry on.

596
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:52,667
<i>Ship's Log, Commander William</i>
<i>Riker reporting:</i>

597
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:55,208
<i>Continuing our appraisal</i>
<i>of Ligonian technology.</i>

598
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,917
<i>The Captain has made it clear</i>
<i>he wants Lieutenant Yar</i>

599
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,417

601
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,041
<i>And I fervently hope</i>

602
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,917
<i>of that contest</i>
<i>make it possible.</i>

603
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:08,083
Riker to Transporter Chief.

604
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,250
Do we have our people
on sensors yet?

605
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,333
Their general area, sir,
visual on screen now.

606
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,834
As you see, we're still
doing some fine tuning.

607
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,750
I've agreed
to this meeting,

608
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,667
but I see no point to it.

609
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,083
You've accepted
the challenge,

610
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,709
and there is nothing
further to say.

611
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:27,583
I think you should
know that there is

612
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:31,041
no physical training anywhere
that matches Starfleet,

613
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,917
especially
its security people.

614
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,959
And you should
know that,

615
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:36,959
even though these
contests are rare,

616
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:40,166
we have a tradition of making
ourselves capable of them.

617
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,125
Yareena...

618
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,000
my acceptance had
nothing to do with Lutan.

619
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,083
It has everything
to do with Lutan!

620
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,166
Lutan wants you
to be his first one.

621
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,625
Impossible, Yareena.

622
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:52,125
I am a career
Starfleet officer.

623
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,667
How could you not love him?

624
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:56,291
Every woman loves him.

625
00:32:56,291 --> 00:33:00,000
I fight for
the vaccine.

626
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,875
That's the truth.

627
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,417
The truth...

628
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:06,625
is I will kill you
if I can.

629
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:09,250
And believe me, I can.

630
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,750
There's nothing else
to say.

631
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,291
In my world,
it's a greater honor
to refuse...

632
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,500
You are on our world!

633
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:28,375
Captain, I'm
your counselor.

634
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:31,291
You brought me with you
to Ligon to be of help.

635
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:33,333
Then help me, please.

636
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,583
What is a way
out of this?

637
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:36,875
With the vaccine?

638
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,375
Mm-hmm.

639
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,750
None.

640
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:44,875
The weapons in
that room, Captain,

641
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:48,000
are surprisingly flexible,
durable, and deadly.

642
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,375
And light, as if they were
made for women to use.

643
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:54,417
Mm. Some of them still have
traces of blood and poison.

644
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:55,750
Poison?
Mm.

645
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,208
Alkaloid base.
Lethal.

646
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:01,917
What about those lengths of
metal in the yard outside?

647
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:04,041
Uncertain, sir.

648
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,375
However,
joined together,

649
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,041
they would make
a rectangle or square

650
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,542
enclosing
121 square meters.

651
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:11,000
If put end to end
vertically,

652
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,125
they would make a pole
44 meters high--

653
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,667
or two of 22.

654
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:16,291
Thank you, Data.

655
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,208
You're welcome, sir.

656
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:24,667
She won't budge.

657
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,542
She loves him,
without reservation.

658
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:30,583
And she thinks
I love him, too.

659
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,250
Most interesting.

660
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,458
Do you?

661
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,959
Of course I don't, Data.

662
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:38,417
As Troi pointed out to me,
I'm attracted to him,

663
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:40,417
but that's
entirely different.

664
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:41,959
(<i> over com</i> ):
Riker to Captain.

665
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,834
Go ahead, Riker.
We're alone.

666
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:46,458
We're fine-tuned enough
to see your hosts

667
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:49,375
gathering in the open area
outside, sir.

668
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:52,000
Three of them are heading
for your location.

669
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,375
Thank you,
Number One.

670
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,583
Lieutenant, you still
feel that you want

671
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,583
to go through with
this challenge?

672
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:01,709
You judge your
condition good?

673
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:04,125
I judge it excellent, sir.

674
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:13,417
Your weapons,
Lieutenant Yar.

675
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:15,458
You may choose
your size.

676
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:34,208
Tasha, don't
touch the spines.
They're poisoned.

677
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,959
If you're not careful,
you could kill yourself.

678
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:42,333
These I understand.

679
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:46,166

They've got eyes
only for the program.

693
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,417
Captain Picard
wanted no risk

694
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:58,250
of our communication
being overheard.

695
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,417
You are to proceed
now, as he indicated.

696
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:03,291
Captain's orders, too.

697
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:04,750
Did the Captain
understand

698
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,583
what you and Geordi reported
about these weapons?

699
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:09,208
They're razor-sharp,
split-second lethal?

700
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,750
I'm here to brief you
on what he plans.

Stay alive.

704
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,208
We'll hope
to do the rest.

00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,834
Careful, Yareena!

715
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,000
(<i> all gasp</i> )

716
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,458
Move!

717
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,458
We're too late.

718
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:23,917
She's growing cold.

719
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:26,500
Sorry, that clashes
with my instructions.

720
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,583
No, no... no, no.

721
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,375
(<i> sighs</i> )

722
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:37,083
Exactly what do you
find unfair, Lutan?

723
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,417
They fought
to the death.

724
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:39,959
You saw the
final blow.

725
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:42,208
You know the effects
of your poison.

726
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:44,000
But what of your
Lieutenant Yar?

727
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,083
She is to become
my first one now.

728
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,458
I certainly
won't stop her

729
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:50,000
if she cares to
claim that honor.

730
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,959
Remember, you have
all Yareena's wealth
and lands, Lutan.

731
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,250
(<i> chuckles</i> )

732
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,792
At least all
has not been lost.

733
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:00,166
(<i> over com</i> ):
Riker to Captain.

734
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,583
Picard here.

735
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,834
Since you've fulfilled
your agreement, Captain,

736
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:06,834
can we now beam
the vaccine aboard?

737
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:09,083
Ah, yes, of course.

738
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:11,125
No problem, Number One.

739
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:12,834
Send down a medical team.

740
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:14,917
And to complete
our business here--

741
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:17,083
we're locked onto you.

742
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:20,375
Five to beam up.

743
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,542
Energize.

744
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,750
Welcome back,
Captain.

745
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,250
You're wanted
in the lounge.

746
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,709
This way, gentlemen.

747
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:54,917
She is not dead!

748
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:57,041
There was no death combat.

749
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:59,208
You violated
our agreement.

750
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:02,166
There will be no treaty,
no vaccine.

751
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,125
The challenge was
carried out.

752
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,875
She died, Lutan.

753
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,500
There was no challenge.

754
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,625
She lives!

755
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,709
I am a physician
and saw her die.

756
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:12,792
If you doubt this poison,

757
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,500
why don't you test
it on yourself?

758
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,458
Lutan, we can
provide you

759
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:19,291
with records of her death

760
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:21,709
and how Dr. Crusher
brought her back.

761
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:24,041
And at the instant
of death, Lutan,

762
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,083
a mating agreement dissolves.

763
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:28,458
But this is witchcraft,
Yareena.

764
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:30,625
To discard a mate
in this manner...

765
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:34,500
Is less painful than the one
you selected for me.

766
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:39,333
Yareena, no.

767
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:43,333
Even as I battled,
Hagon,

768
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:46,250
I heard you
calling out for me.

769
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:51,500
Yareena, be
my first one.

770
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,834
All my land
and all my goods--

771
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:57,625
all I have is yours
to rule.

772
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:02,000
How sad for you.

773
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,291
You've lost everything.

774
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:06,250
I have my honor.

775
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,875
It's... such a waste.

776
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:11,250
Do you want him?

777
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,291
No.

778
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:19,458
There would...

779
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,125
be complications.

780
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:26,333
Then I will have you
as my number two.

781
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:29,458
Take your place,
accordingly.

782
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,375
Well, as you see,

783
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:37,250
Captain, you may
excel in technology

784
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,959
but not in
civilized behavior.

785
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:00,667
What...?

786
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:03,375
PICARD:
Wesley?

787
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,041
Yeah, Wesley,
he'd been manning

788
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:08,667
that station for me,
I forgot.

789
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:11,750
Well...

790
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:15,250
thanks again for manning one
of our Bridge stations, Wesley.

791
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,208
We'll see...

792
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:18,583
that you have
another chance.

793
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,041
Yes, sir.

794
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:24,291
So what's the delay,
Number One?

795
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:26,166
Why aren't we warping
out of here?

796
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,208
Set course
for Styris IV, warp 3.

797
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,875
Course laid in
for Styris IV, sir.

798
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,792
Engage.
